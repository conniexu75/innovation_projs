https://openalex.org/W2057764483,"Autophagy is a bulk protein degradation process that is induced by starvation. The control mechanism for induction of autophagy is not well understood. We found that Tor, a phosphatidylinositol kinase homologue, is involved in the control of autophagy in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When rapamycin, an inhibitor of Tor function, is added, autophagy is induced even in cells growing in nutrient-rich medium. A temperature-sensitivetor mutant also leads to induction of autophagy at a nonpermissive temperature. These results indicate that Tor negatively regulates the induction of autophagy. Tor is the first molecule that is identified as a pivotal player in the starvation-signaling pathway of autophagy. Furthermore, we found that a high concentration of cAMP is inhibitory for induction of autophagy. APG gene products are involved in autophagy induced by starvation. Autophagy was not induced in apg mutants in the presence of rapamycin, indicating that the site of action of Tor is upstream of those of Apg proteins. In nutrient-rich medium, Apg proteins are involved also in the transport of aminopeptidase I from the cytosol to the vacuole. Tor may act to switch Apg function between autophagy and transport of aminopeptidase I. Autophagy is a bulk protein degradation process that is induced by starvation.

Tor may act to switch Apg function between autophagy and transport of aminopeptidase I. When nutrients are depleted from the environment, mammalian as well as yeast cells begin to degrade their own cytosol and organelles. This bulk protein degradation is mediated mainly by autophagy, the process in which cytoplasmic components are delivered to the lysosome (1Dunn Jr., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In the process of autophagy, a portion of cytoplasm is sequestered by a double or multi-layered membrane structure, referred to as the autophagosome (1Dunn Jr., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The autophagosome fuses with endosomal or lysosomal membranes, resulting eventually in degradation of cytoplasmic materials (1Dunn Jr., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 2Liou W. Geuze H.J. Geelen M.J.H. Slot J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).To initiate this dynamic reorganization of intracellular membranes, as occurs during formation of autophagosome, cells are expected to have a regulatory mechanism of autophagy. Although the overall mechanism remains to be elucidated, some factors have been reported to be involved in this control in mammalian cells. For example, formation of autophagosomes is inhibited by amino acids (3Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Kovacs A.L. Gordon P.B. Holen I. Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1981; 133: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), by insulin (5Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), by cell swelling (6Meijer A.J. Lof C. Ramons I.C. Verhoven A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and by cAMP (7Holen I. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 389-392PubMed Google Scholar). Blommaart et al.reported that the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and autophagy are controlled by the same signal transduction pathway (8Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P.

S6 phosphorylation is mediated by the serine/threonine kinase p70S6k (9Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, autophagy is induced by starvation (10Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The sequence of events in yeast is essentially the same as that of mammalian cells: formation of an autophagosome is followed by fusion of the autophagosome to the vacuole, which is equivalent to a lysosome in mammalian cells (11Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The inner membrane structures of the autophagosome are delivered to the vacuole as the autophagic bodies (11Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The autophagic bodies are destroyed depending on proteinase B activity in the vacuole (10Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). However, the induction mechanism of autophagy in yeast is not well understood.Nutrient starvation not only induces autophagy but also arrests cells at early G1 phase. Tor, a phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase, is known to be involved in the signaling pathway from nutrient starvation to G1 arrest in yeast (12Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar, 13Helliwell S.B. Wagner P. Kunz J. Deuter-Reinhard M. Henriquez R. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressive drug rapamycin is effective in arresting yeast at early G1 phase (12Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). The effect of rapamycin is mediated by FKBP, and it is the FKBP-rapamycin complex that binds to Tor (16Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5892-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27531-27537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). There are two Tors in yeast, and inactivation of both Tors leads to G1 arrest (15Baedet N.B. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stanfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In addition to inhibiting G1progression, Tor2p has another essential function that appears to be involved in the organization of the actin cytoskelton (13Helliwell S.B. Wagner P. Kunz J. Deuter-Reinhard M. Henriquez R. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N.

A. 1996; 93: 13780-13785Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Tor1p does not have this function, which is not inhibited by rapamycin (19Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To investigate the control mechanism of autophagy in yeast, we determined the effects of inactivating Tor and of a high concentration of cAMP.RESULTSAutophagy in yeast is induced under starvation conditions (10Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) and can be followed as an accumulation of autophagic bodies in the vacuole when vacuolar degradation is inhibited by inactivation of proteinase B (Fig. 1 A). In nutrient-rich YPD medium, autophagy usually does not occur (Fig. 1 B). However, when rapamycin was added to cells growing in YPD, it was found that autophagic bodies accumulate in the vacuole, indicating that autophagy was induced (Fig. 1 C). This morphological observation was confirmed by use of the biochemical assay for autophagy developed previously (21Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the fact that the vacuolar membrane protein alkaline phosphatase, Pho8p, becomes localized in the cytoplasm if its transmembrane region is truncated (21Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). When autophagy occurs, this truncated Pho8p, Pho8Δ60p, is delivered to the vacuole where it becomes active as a result of processing by vacuolar proteases (21Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Therefore, the measurement of phosphatase activity provides a simple assay for autophagic activity (21Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). When rapamycin was added to YPD culture of cells harboringpho8Δ60, alkaline phosphatase activity increased, implying that autophagy had been induced (Fig. 2, lane 3).Figure 2The effect of Tor inactivation on autophagy monitored by biochemical assay. Each cell culture in YPD medium was incubated at 30 or 37 °C in the absence or the presence of 0.2 μg/ml of rapamycin. After 0 or 3 h, the cells were harvested and subjected to alkaline phosphatase assay to measure autophagic activity. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method. Representative results of three experiments are presented. Wild type (TN125);Δfkb1 (TN127); Δtor1 tor2 ts(TN128).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Rapamycin is known to bind to the FK506 binding protein, FKBP, to effect cell cycle arrest in yeast (12Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). We investigated whether FKBP is involved in this induction of autophagy by rapamycin. Disruption of FKB1, the gene for FKBP, resulted in the failure of rapamycin to induce autophagy (Fig. 2, compare lane 3 and 5). This result indicates that the action of rapamycin in inducing autophagy is mediated by FKBP.The FKBP-rapamycin complex inhibits Tor function (16Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5892-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27531-27537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the two TOR genes leads to G1 arrest (15Baedet N.B. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stanfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The Pho8Δ60 gene was introduced into cells in which bothTOR1 and TOR2 were deleted and harbored temperature-sensitive allele of TOR2 in a plasmid. This strain grows at 30 °C but not at 37 °C (15Baedet N.B. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stanfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). 1M. Hall, personal communication. Alkaline phosphatase activity was increased when tor2ts cells harboringPho8Δ60 were incubated in YPD medium for 3 h at 37 °C, whereas it was not increased at 30 °C in the same cells or in the wild-type TOR cells at 37 °C (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8). Based on these results, we concluded that inactivation of Tor function is sufficient for induction of autophagy.It has been reported that treatment with rapamycin or inactivation of Tors leads to cell arrest at early G1 phase (15Baedet N.B. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stanfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that autophagy is induced when the cell cycle is arrested at any phase. To investigate this possibility, we treated cells with hydroxyurea to arrest the cell cycle at S phase or with nocodazole to arrest the cell cycle at M phase. After 3 h of treatment with these reagents, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that most cells were arrested at S or M phase. After treatment with hydroxyurea, 83% of the are with 1 n DNA as compared with 56% in control cells. After treatment with nocodazole, 76% of the cells are with 2 n DNA as compared with 44% in control cells. However, in those cell cycle arrested cells, autophagy was not induced (Fig. 3). Moreover, when rapamycin was added to the cells arrested at S or M phase, autophagy was still induced, indicating that cell cycle arrest at G1is not prerequisite for induction of autophagy (Fig. 3).Figure 3Relationship between autophagy and cell cycle. Hydroxyurea or nocodazole was added to the cell cultures of wild-type strain TN125 cells in YPD medium. After 3 h, rapamycin was added to the half of each cell culture and incubated further for 3 h. At the time indicated, the cells were harvested and subjected to alkaline phosphatase assay to measure autophagic activity. Representative results of three experiments are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In our laboratory, 14 autophagy defective mutants, calledapg mutants, have been isolated (22Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Most of theAPG genes have been cloned and sequenced; however, their sites of action in the autophagic process are still to be determined (25Funakoshi T. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 240-250Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 27Kametaka S. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 178: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have investigated the effect of rapamycin onapg mutants by observing the accumulation of autophagic bodies in the presence of rapamycin. It was found that none of theapg mutants accumulated autophagic bodies, implying that autophagy was not induced (panels D–F in Fig. 1 show the representative three apg mutants, but the otherapg mutants were not shown). Therefore, the sites of action of all APG gene products are presumed to be downstream of the site of action of Tor.Next we investigated the effect of cAMP, which is thought to play some role in cell cycle control by nutrient availability (28Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It has been reported that cells harboring a triple mutation in cAMP pathway (pde1, pde2, and cyr1) are able to respond to exogenously added 1 mm cAMP, because phosphodiesterases (Pde1p, Pde2p), which are thought to degrade exogenously added cAMP, are defective (20Mitsuzawa H. Genetics. 1993; 135: 321-326PubMed Google Scholar). This strain grown in the presence of cAMP showed the same phenotypes as mutants with an elevated activity of the cAMP pathway, such as low glycogen accumulation (20Mitsuzawa H. Genetics. 1993; 135: 321-326PubMed Google Scholar). In pho8Δ60 cells having these mutations as well as in wild-type cells, nitrogen starvation induced autophagy (Fig.4). When cAMP was added to the medium, the induction of autophagy in these cells was inhibited (Fig. 4). Furthermore, this inhibition was not overcome by rapamycin (Fig. 4). These results indicated that 1 mm cAMP is inhibitory for the induction of autophagy.Figure 4The effect of cAMP on autophagy. Triple mutant strain (TN126) in cAMP pathway was transferred to starvation medium, SD(−N) in the absence or the presence of 1 mm cAMP and/or 0.2 μg/ml of rapamycin at 0 h. After 3 h at 30 °C, the cells were harvested and subjected to alkaline phosphatase assay to measure autophagic activity. Protein concentration is determined by the BCA method. Representative results of three experiments are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we showed that Tor function is involved in the induction of autophagy in yeast. Inactivation of Tor by rapamycin treatment or by using a temperature-sensitive allele of TOR2promoted autophagy even under nutrient-rich conditions. Although the kinase domain of Tor was shown to be necessary for G1 cell cycle progression (19Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined whether Tor possesses actual kinase activity. Therefore, the mechanism through which Tor transmits signals is still unknown. However, from our results, it would be reasonable to speculate that under nutrient-rich conditions, Tor functions by blocking a factor needed for initiation of autophagy. This model would be consistent with what is known in mammalian cells, where the condition for phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 is inhibitory for autophagy (8Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). S6 phosphorylation is sensitive to rapamycin, suggesting that a rapamycin-sensitive factor is involved upstream of S6 phosphorylation and autophagy (8Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 29Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). We assume that this factor is RAFT/FRAP, the mammalian counterpart of Tor, which mediates S6 kinase activity (29Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 30Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L.

A. 1994; 91: 12574-12578Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar).Baedet et al. reported that inactivation of Tor leads to several G0/stationary phase responses, which are also produced by nitrogen starvation (15Baedet N.B. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stanfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). We showed that cell cycle arrest at S or M phase does not induce autophagy, implying that cell cycle arrest by itself is not the cause of induction of autophagy. Morover, even after the cell cycle is arrested at S or M phase, autophagy was induced by rapamycin treatment. This means that G1 arrest itself is not the cause of autophagy, and autophagy and G1arrest are induced in a parallel manner under starvation conditions by the inactivation of Tor. Baedet et al. reported that the loss of Tor function also causes an inhibition of translation and proposed that the inhibition of protein synthesis causes G1arrest (15Baedet N.B. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stanfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). We observed that the cells treated with cycloheximide in YPD did not induce autophagy (data not shown). Moreover, we have found that treatment with cycloheximide is inhibitory for induction of autophagy under starvation conditions (10Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional experiments are needed to investigate the role of mRNA translation in autophagy.There is a report that the two Tor proteins are involved in the initiation of sporulation (33Zheng X.-F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3070-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Sporulation is usually induced only in starvation medium, but inhibition of Tor function by rapamycin or by expressing a kinase-inactive mutant leads to initiation of sporulation even in nutrient-rich medium (33Zheng X.-F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3070-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Autophagy-defective mutants do not sporulate (22Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar), suggesting that autophagy is prerequisite for sporulation. So our finding that Tors are involved in control of autophagy is consistent with the report (33Zheng X.-F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3070-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) on the involvement of Tor in initiation of sporulation. Tor2p has been shown to signal to the actin cytoskelton via the small GTPase Rho (18Schmidt A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13780-13785Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Because this function is specific to Tor2p and insensitive to rapamycin (19Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we assume that it is not involved in autophagy.The Ras-cAMP pathway is involved both in G1 progression and initiation of sporulation, although the cAMP level does not change with nitrogen source availability (28Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 35Broach J.R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Our finding indicates that increasing the concentration of cAMP inhibits autophagy even in the presence of rapamycin. The inhibitory effect of cAMP is observed also in mammalian cells (7Holen I. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 389-392PubMed Google Scholar). Baedet et al. reported that G1 arrest by rapamycin is not affected by hyperactivation of the Ras-cAMP pathway using bcy1 or ras2mutants, suggesting that the Ras-cAMP pathway is independent of the Tor pathway to G1 arrest (15Baedet N.B. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stanfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike the case of G1 arrest, cAMP may have to be kept below a certain critical level to initiate autophagy. Too high a concentration of cAMP may perturb some factors involved in the induction of autophagy.APG and other autophagy-relative genes were reported to function not only in autophagy but also in the transport of aminopeptidase I (API) 2The abbreviation used is: API, aminopeptidase I. to the vacuole (36Scott S.V. Hefnergravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 37Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Unlike most of the vacuolar enzymes, API is delivered from cytosol to the vacuole via nonsecretory and vesicle-mediated pathway (38Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 39Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although both API transport and autophagy involve cytoplasm to vacuole delivery, API transport has different characteristics from autophagy. For example, API is delivered even under nutrient-rich condition, and its transport is highly selective. In contrast, autophagy is induced only under starvation, and autophagic delivery of the cytosol is nonselective (36Scott S.V. Hefnergravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Therefore a factor that switches between autophagy and API transport might exist. Our analysis with apg mutants indicated that allAPG gene products function downstream of Tors. Tor might be a molecule that switches Apg function directly or indirectly between autophagy and API transport.Tor is the first molecule identified in the signal pathway in autophagy. We have found significant similarities in the control mechanism for autophagy of mammalian cells and yeast. Further analysis of autophagy in yeast would help our understanding of the process in mammalian cells. When nutrients are depleted from the environment, mammalian as well as yeast cells begin to degrade their own cytosol and organelles. This bulk protein degradation is mediated mainly by autophagy, the process in which cytoplasmic components are delivered to the lysosome (1Dunn Jr., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In the process of autophagy, a portion of cytoplasm is sequestered by a double or multi-layered membrane structure, referred to as the autophagosome (1Dunn Jr., W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The autophagosome fuses with endosomal or lysosomal membranes, resulting eventually in degradation of cytoplasmic materials (1Dunn Jr., W.A.

To initiate this dynamic reorganization of intracellular membranes, as occurs during formation of autophagosome, cells are expected to have a regulatory mechanism of autophagy. Although the overall mechanism remains to be elucidated, some factors have been reported to be involved in this control in mammalian cells. For example, formation of autophagosomes is inhibited by amino acids (3Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Kovacs A.L. Gordon P.B. Holen I. Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1981; 133: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), by insulin (5Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia. 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), by cell swelling (6Meijer A.J. Lof C. Ramons I.C. Verhoven A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and by cAMP (7Holen I. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 389-392PubMed Google Scholar). Blommaart et al.reported that the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and autophagy are controlled by the same signal transduction pathway (8Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P.

S6 phosphorylation is mediated by the serine/threonine kinase p70S6k (9Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, autophagy is induced by starvation (10Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The sequence of events in yeast is essentially the same as that of mammalian cells: formation of an autophagosome is followed by fusion of the autophagosome to the vacuole, which is equivalent to a lysosome in mammalian cells (11Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The inner membrane structures of the autophagosome are delivered to the vacuole as the autophagic bodies (11Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The autophagic bodies are destroyed depending on proteinase B activity in the vacuole (10Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). However, the induction mechanism of autophagy in yeast is not well understood. Nutrient starvation not only induces autophagy but also arrests cells at early G1 phase. Tor, a phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase, is known to be involved in the signaling pathway from nutrient starvation to G1 arrest in yeast (12Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N.

The dynamic remodeling of tissue architecture which occurs during development must also occur during tissue repair after injury. During development and after injury, cells must decide whether to proliferate, differentiate, or initiate a cell death program based on signals they receive from their extracellular environment. For most cell types, these decisions depend on soluble growth factors and on their attachment to the extracellular matrix or adjacent cells. Thus cells respond both to their growth factor milieu and adhesive environment (for review, see Ref. 1Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion molecules/receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins that act at the cell surface to mediate specific binding interactions with other cell adhesion molecules on adjacent cells or with proteins in the extracellular matrix.

These molecules can influence growth factor expression, and conversely growth factors can modulate production of cell surface adhesion molecules and the expression of extracellular matrix proteins (for review, see Refs. 1Sastry S.K.

The critical importance of adhesion molecules and growth factors for renal development has been demonstrated by severe abnormalities that result from gene disruption of α3 and α8 integrin subunits (3DiPersio C.M.

Nature. 1996; 382: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). To study the process of tissue injury and repair, we have chosen an ischemic/reperfusion model of acute renal failure in which the kidney has the capacity for cell renewal (both structurally and functionally) after injury to tubular epithelial cells (10Thadhani R. Pascual M. Bonventre J.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1448-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). In this model the nephron is damaged functionally by an ischemic reperfusion injury that results in regional areas of proximal tubule cell death. During the repair process the kidney proximal tubule epithelium undergoes a complex series of events involving 1) cell death and cast formation in the tubule lumen (casts are aggregates of dead, semiviable, and viable cells and other cell debris); 2) proliferation of surviving proximal tubule epithelial cells; 3) formation of a poorly differentiated regenerative epithelium over the denuded basement membrane (this simplified epithelium expresses vimentin, a mesenchymal marker); and 4) differentiation of the regenerative epithelium to form fully functional proximal tubule epithelial cells (10Thadhani R. Pascual M. Bonventre J.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1448-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 11Wallin A. Zhang G. Jones T.W. Jaken S. Stevens J.L. Lab.

Maier J.A.-M. Maciag T. Zhang G. Stevens J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F653-F662PubMed Google Scholar). Growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor have been implicated in this repair process as has the endothelial cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (for review, see Refs. 10Thadhani R. Pascual M. Bonventre J.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1448-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar and 14Hammerman M.R. Miller S.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 5: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms by which the tubular epithelial cells are restored are still not understood. To identify molecules involved in processes of injury and repair of the tubular epithelium, we analyzed the difference in the mRNA populations between regenerating and normal kidneys using representational difference analysis (RDA). RDA is a PCR-based method for subtraction originally designed to identify differences at the genomic level (15Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar) and subsequently applied to cDNA analysis (16Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) to evaluate differences in gene expression. In this report we describe the identification of rat and human cDNAs encoding kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1). KIM-1 is a type 1 membrane protein containing a unique Ig-like domain and a mucin domain in its extracellular portion. Structurally, KIM-1 most closely resembles mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) (17Briskin M.J. McEvoy L.M. Butcher E.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). These KIM-1 genes show high homology to the monkey gene, hepatitis A virus cell receptor 1 (HAVcr-1), which was identified as a receptor for the hepatitis A virus (18Kaplan G. Totsuka A. Thompson P. Akatsuka T. Moritsugu Y. Feinstone S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4282-4296Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrate that KIM-1 mRNA and protein are expressed at high levels in regenerating proximal tubule epithelial cells. Structure and expression data suggest that KIM-1 is a novel epithelial CAM up-regulated on regenerating proximal tubule epithelial cells, which are the cells known to repair and regenerate the damaged region of the nephron in the postischemic kidney. Unilateral ischemic rat kidneys were generated as described by Witzgall et al. (12Witzgall R. Brown D. Schwarz C. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). 190–275-g male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc.) were administered 10 ml of 0.9% saline (37 °C) intraperitoneally. Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (6.5 mg/100 g body weight). The renal artery and vein were clamped with a microaneurysm clamp (Roboz Surgical Instrument Co.). The incision was closed until 40 min later when the clamp was removed. The incision was then sutured closed, and both kidneys were removed at 24 or 48 h after reperfusion. Both postischemic and contralateral control kidneys were either frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed for in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry. 40 min of renal vascular occlusion results in a marked reduction in glomerular filtration rate as measured 1–3 h after reperfusion (19Malis C.D. Cheung J.Y. Leaf A. Bonventre J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F735-F742PubMed Google Scholar) and a marked increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen if the vascular occlusion is bilateral (20Kelly K.J. Williams W.W. Colvin R.B. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Because one kidney from the animal is functionally intact, the model of unilateral ischemia used in these studies results in only mild increases in plasma creatinine (from 0.52 ± 0.02 to 0.68 ± 0.08 mg/dl) and blood urea nitrogen (17.5 ± 0.4 to 20.5 ± 1.5 mg/dl) (mean ± S.E.) (n = 4) (19Malis C.D. Cheung J.Y. Leaf A. Bonventre J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F735-F742PubMed Google Scholar). Subtraction was performed following the method of Hubank and Schatz (16Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA from normal and 48 h postischemic kidneys was prepared based on the protocol of Glisin et al. (21Glisin V. Crkvenjakov R. Byus C. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Harvested organs were placed into GNC buffer (4 m guanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% SDS, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% Sigma antifoam) and disrupted on ice with a Polytron. Cell debris was removed with a low speed spin in a clinical centrifuge, and the supernatant was placed on a 5.7 m CsCl, 25 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA cushion. RNA was pelleted through the cushion in an SW 40 Ti rotor at 85,000 × g for 22.5 h, resuspended, and then precipitated. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using an mRNA purification kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from normal and from 48 h postischemic kidney poly(A)+ RNA using the Life Technologies, Inc. Superscript ChoiceTM. 48 h postischemic kidney cDNA was digested with DpnII and ligated to R-Bgl-12/24 adapter oligonucleotides (R-Bgl-12: GATCTGCGGTGA; R-Bgl-24: AGCACTCTCCAGCCTCTCACCGCA). PCR amplification using R-Bgl-24 oligonucleotides of the adapter-ligated cDNA was used to generate the initial representation designated “tester amplicon.” Perkin-Elmer Taq polymerase was used for PCR amplification. The same procedure was used to generate “driver amplicon” from normal rat kidney cDNA. Both amplicons were digested by DpnII; then the tester amplicon was gel purified and ligated to J-Bgl-12/24 (J-Bgl-12: GATCTGTTCATG; J-Bgl-24: ACCGACGTCGACTATCCATGAACA) adapters. For the first subtractive hybridization, driver and tester amplicons were mixed in the ratio of 100:1. The mixture was phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in 4 μl of EE×3 buffer (30 mm EPPS, pH 8.0, at 20 °C; 3 mm EDTA). The DNA was denatured for 6 min at 98 °C. The salt concentration was adjusted with 1 μl of 5 m NaCl, annealed for 20 h at 67 °C. Hybridized DNA was diluted with TE containing tRNA. To fill ends of this hybrid DNA, a PCR was set up with diluted samples without adding the primers. The J-Bgl-12 primer was then melted away, ends filled in with Taq DNA polymerase, and J-Bgl-24 primer added to complete amplification. This product was digested with mung bean nuclease for 35 min at 30 °C to remove single-stranded DNA. The digest was heated to 98 °C and used in a PCR with J-Bgl-24 primer. This is designated differential product 1 (DP-1). J adapters on the DP-1 were changed to N-Bgl-12/24 primers (N-Bgl-12: GATCTTCCCTCG; N-Bgl-24: AGGCAACTGTGCTATCCGAGGGAA). A driver:tester ratio of 5,333:1 was used to generate DP-2. N adapters on DP-2 were again changed to J-Bgl-12/24 primers to generate DP-3 with a driver:tester ratio of 4,000:1 and 40,000:1. DP-3 products were gel and Qiaex II purified (Qiagen) for subcloning. The DP-3 products were subcloned using the Sureclone kit (Pharmacia) into the SmaI site of pUC18 vector. DP-3 product 1-7 was cloned from DP-3 after 40,000:1 driver:tester ratios, and 3-2 and 3-10 were cloned from DP-3 after 4,000:1. A cDNA library was generated from 4 μg of poly(A)+RNA from 48 h postischemic rat kidneys using the Superscript ChoiceTM system for cDNA synthesis and λZapII (Stratagene) cloning kit. 105 clones were screened with the 1-7 RDA and 3-2 RDA products and radiolabeled using the Pharmacia Ready-to-go random priming labeling kit with [32P]dCTP. After tertiary screening, four pure phage clones were isolated for each. To obtain the human homolog of clone 3-2, a 32P-labeled DNA probe comprising nucleotides 546–969 of the fragment derived from clone 3-2 shown in Fig. 1 was generated and used to screen a human embryonic liver λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH). 106 clones were screened in duplicate as above at 55 °C. The filters were washed in 2 × SSC at 55 °C. 50 positive phage plaques were identified, plaque purified, and DNA isolated. Phage DNAs were subjected to Southern analysis using the same region 546–969 probe as above and subjected to a final wash with 0.5 × SSC at 55 °C. Two clones were identified as positive. Poly(A)+ RNA (2.5 μg) from normal adult rat kidney (sham operated), 48 h postischemic adult kidney, and day 18 embryonic kidney was electrophoresed and transferred (22Cate R.L. Mattaliano R.J. Hession C. Tizard R. Farber N.M. Cheung A. Ninfa E.G. Frey A.Z. Gash D.J. Chow E.P. Fisher R.A. Bertonis J.M. Torres G. Wallner B.P. Ramachandran K.L. Ragin R.C. Manganaro T.F. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1986; 45: 685-698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) to a GeneScreen membrane (NEN Life Science Products). For adult rat tissues, a CLONTECH multiple tissue Northern blot was used. Hybridization with the entire coding region of KIM-1 was carried out in plaque screening buffer (PSB, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% Ficoll, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1% SDS) containing 10% dextran sulfate and 100 μg/ml tRNA at 65 °C. In situ hybridization was carried out according to Finch et al. (23Finch P.W. Cunha G.R. Rubin J.S. Wong J. Ron D. Dev. Dynamics. 1995; 203: 223-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Briefly, kidneys were perfusion fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, further fixed overnight at 4 °C, and processed for paraffin sections. Sections were then dehydrated and hybridized at 55 °C overnight, with 33P-labeled riboprobes generated from 3-2 RDA product subcloned into the BamHI site of pGEM-11Z. After hybridization, sections were washed under high stringency conditions (2 × SSC, 50% formamide at 65 °C). Nonhybridized probe was digested with 20 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. After further high stringency washing conditions, sections were dehydrated through graded alcohols containing 0.3 m ammonium acetate. NBT-2 emulsion (Eastman Kodak) was used for autoradiography and exposed for at least a week. Silver grains were developed, and sections were counterstained with toluidine blue and photographed with Axioplan microscope (Zeiss). The antigens used to raise antibodies against the rat KIM-1 protein were the peptide R9 HPRAEDNIYIIEDRSRGC cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) and a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) linked to the NH2-terminal Ig domain of the rat KIM-1 protein (amino acids 1–134). 50 μg of the GST-KIM-1 (positions 1–134) or of keyhole limpet hemocyanin-peptide conjugate was used to immunize a rabbit as described (24Sigel M.B. Sinha Y.N. VanderLaan W.P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 93: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Anti-GST-KIM-1 (positions 1–134) antibodies were affinity purified from the antiserum on gel-purified nitrocellulose-bound denatured GST-KIM-1 (positions 1–134). The antibodies raised against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-peptide conjugates were affinity purified on a Sepharose matrix (SulfoLink coupling gel; Pierce). Hemisected kidneys were minced and homogenized in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm β-glycosphosphate 2 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin) with a Polytron. The insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. It was resuspended once more in Krebs-Henseleit buffer and repelleted by centrifugation. The pellets were weighed and resuspended in 1 g/ml of Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 × g. A fragment of the full-length KIM-1 cDNA was cloned in the Biogen expression vector pEAG347 for transient expression in COS cells. COS cells were transfected with the control plasmid pEAG347 and with SJR106, the plasmid containing the KIM-1 gene. The cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were harvested 25 or 48 h after transfection, resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, containing CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim), and broken by mechanic shearing. The insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (5 min at 20,000 ×g); the supernatant was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in the breakage buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Again, insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation. Aliquots of COS cells and kidney extracts were mixed with Laemmli loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% precast gels (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co.). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in 10 mmCAPS, pH 11, 10% methanol. The blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 and probed in the same solution with affinity-purified antibodies raised against peptide R9 or with affinity-purified antibodies raised against GST-KIM-1 (positions 1–134) (0.1 μg/ml). Washes were done with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. The secondary probing was done in the blocking solution with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) diluted 5,000-fold, and the reacting bands were revealed by chemiluminescence with the supersignal ULTRA chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). CNBr digests were done as described (25Pepinsky R.B. Sinclair L.K. Nature. 1986; 321: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Slices (of about 5 × 4 mm) of the polyacrylamide gel containing the putative KIM-1 protein bands were excised with a razor blade using the prestained molecular markers as guide marks. After a 10-min wash in distilled water, they were soaked in 300 μl of 0.1 m HCl, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol to which a 50-μl aliquot of fresh CNBr solution in formic acid (700 μg/ml) was added. After 1 h of reaction at room temperature, the slices were washed twice for 5 min with distilled water, once with 0.25 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the Laemmli SDS loading buffer. The slices were then inserted into the wells of a 10–20% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose the membrane was exposed to the anti-KIM-1 antibody. An affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide R9 antibody and a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector) (13Ichimura T. Maier J.A.-M. Maciag T. Zhang G. Stevens J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F653-F662PubMed Google Scholar) were used for immunohistochemistry. Paraformaldehye-fixed paraffin sections were deparaffinized, and endogenous peroxidase activity was ablated by incubation in 2% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 20 min. The sections were heated with a microwave oven in 0.1 mcitrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 10 min (26Shi S.R. Chaiwun B. Young L. Cote R.J. Taylor C.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The sections were blocked with diluted goat serum (1:67) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with affinity-purified or control IgG at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. After 1 h, the sections were washed in PBS and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. After further washes with PBS, the sections were incubated with an avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex for 1 h. Sections were washed in PBS and developed by the addition of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.12% 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma), 0.0075% nickel chloride, 0.0075% cobalt chloride, and 0.0075% hydrogen peroxide for 2–5 min. The sections were counterstained with 0.01% toluidine blue. Serial sections from rat kidneys fixed in Carnoy's solution after ischemic injury were stained for KIM-1, BrdUrd-labeled nuclei, and regeneration marker vimentin as described (13Ichimura T. Maier J.A.-M. Maciag T. Zhang G. Stevens J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F653-F662PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody, V-9 (Sigma), was used at a 1:10,000 diluted for the Vectastain Elite ABC kit. For vimentin staining, biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector) was used as the secondary antibody. For KIM-1 immunostaining, rabbit polyclonal affinity-purified anti-peptide R9 antibodies were used (1 μg/ml). Labeling for BrdUrd was determined by immunostaining of BrdUrd-labeled nuclei in kidney sections prepared from BrdUrd-treated animals as described (13Ichimura T. Maier J.A.-M. Maciag T. Zhang G. Stevens J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F653-F662PubMed Google Scholar), with modification. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with 60 mg/kg BrdUrd dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (60 mg/ml) 2 h before sacrifice. Deparaffinized sections were pretreated with 4n HCl for 20 min and washed with PBS. Anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Science) was added at a dilution of 1:40 in PBS containing 1.67% normal horse serum. After application of the primary antibody, the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (for mouse IgG) was used. Peroxidase staining was developed for 5 min, as described above, and the sections were counterstained with 0.01% toluidine blue. To identify genes important in the injury/repair process, differences in mRNA populations between regenerating 48 h postischemic adult rat kidneys and normal kidneys were analyzed by RDA. This analysis resulted in the identification of a number of final RDA products, 1-7 RDA (252 base pairs), 3-2 RDA (445 base pairs), and 3-10 RDA (424 base pairs) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two products, 1-7 RDA and 3-2 RDA, were used to screen a λZapII cDNA library generated from 48 h postischemic rat kidney. The insert of the clone obtained with RDA product 3-2 RDA, clone 3-2 cDNA, was approximately 2.6 kilobases and was subjected to DNA sequencing (Fig.1 A). This sequence contains the sequences of all three RDA products (Fig. 1 A). The insert of clone 1-7 cDNA was also sequenced; isolated using the product 1-7 RDA, this insert was a splice variant of 3-2 cDNA which is lacking nucleotides 136–605 (Fig. 1 A). To confirm the specificity of expression of the 3-2 cDNA in injured kidney, RNA was isolated from sham operated, 48 h postischemic rat kidneys and day 18 embryonic rat kidneys. Northern analysis indicates that a 2.5-kilobase 3-2 cDNA mRNA transcript is expressed at low levels in sham and embryonic kidneys but is dramatically up-regulated in the 48 h postischemic kidney (Fig.2 A). The expression profile of 3-2 cDNA validated our RDA data, which indicated that the presence of 3-2 cDNA transcripts is different in the normal and injured kidney mRNA populations. Analysis of adult rat tissues indicates that 3-2 mRNA is detectable only at low levels in normal adult kidney, liver, and spleen (Fig. 2 B). The presence of different sized mRNAs in liver indicates that the primary transcription product of the 3-2 cDNA undergoes alternative splicing and/or polyadenylation. This variability of mRNA size is consistent with the isolation of two different splice variants from 48 h postischemic kidney. To clone a human homolog of KIM-1, a probe comprising nucleotides 546–969 of the insert of clone 3-2 (Fig. 1 A) was generated and used to screen a human embryonic liver λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH). The insert of clone 85 was sequenced and encodes a predicted protein of 334 amino acids which is 43.8% identical and 59.1% similar to the predicted rat KIM-1 protein (Fig.1 B). The sequence of rat 3-2 cDNA, which we have named kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), contains an open reading frame of 307 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). A signal sequence of 21 amino acids is inferred from von Heijne analysis (27von Heijne G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3685) Google Scholar), and a transmembrane region spanning approximately amino acids 235–257 is suggested by hydrophobicity plot analysis (data not shown and Kyte and Doolittle program criteria (28Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar)) indicating that KIM-1 is a type 1 membrane protein. The extracellular domain of KIM-1 is 213 amino acids and contains two distinctive domains. Within the NH2terminus of the extracellular domain of KIM-1, there is homology to the variable domains of the IgSF seen in many family members such as T-cell receptors and immunoglobulins. Typically, these domains contain two cysteine residues. The KIM-1 Ig domain contains the two sequence motifs, L/I/VXL/IXC (amino acids 33–37) and F/YXCXV/AXH (amino acids 106–112) (Fig. 1 B). The former pattern is a signature of the IgSF and is found in IgSF constant regions (29Barclay A.N. Birkeland M.L. Brown M.H. Beyers A.D. Davis S.J. Somoza C. Williams A.F. The Leucocyte Antigen Facts Book. Academic Press, London, UK1993Google Scholar). The latter pattern is a common motif for conserved, disulfide-bonded cysteines in Ig domains (29Barclay A.N. Birkeland M.L. Brown M.H. Beyers A.D. Davis S.J. Somoza C. Williams A.F. The Leucocyte Antigen Facts Book. Academic Press, London, UK1993Google Scholar). Therefore, Cys37 and Cys108 may be able to form an intramolecular disulfide bond. KIM-1 is unique in that in addition to these two cysteine residues, its Ig domain contains four additional cysteines. This six-cysteine Ig domain may define a novel Ig domain structure. The second distinctive domain is a mucin (threonine-, serine-, and proline-rich, T/S/P-rich) domain from amino acid 131 to 201. There are two potential N-linked glycosylation sites between the T/S/P-rich domain and the transmembrane region. The cytoplasmic domain consists of 50 amino acids with no significant peptide motifs observed. The predicted protein sequence of human cDNA clone 85 also contains one Ig, mucin, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domain each as rat KIM-1. All six cysteines within the Ig domains of both proteins are conserved. Within the Ig domain, the rat KIM-1 and human cDNA clone 85 exhibit 68.3% similarity at the protein level. T"

Treatment of cultured human MCF7 breast cancer cells with I3C reversibly suppresses the incorporation of [3H]thymidine without affecting cell viability or estrogen receptor (ER) responsiveness. Flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells revealed that I3C induces a G1 cell cycle arrest. Concurrent with the I3C-induced growth inhibition, Northern blot and Western blot analyses demonstrated that I3C selectively abolished the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, I3C inhibited the endogenous retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and CDK6 phosphorylation of retinoblastoma in vitro to the same extent. After the MCF7 cells reached their maximal growth arrest, the levels of the p21 and p27 CDK inhibitors increased by 50%. The antiestrogen tamoxifen also suppressed MCF7 cell DNA synthesis but had no effect on CDK6 expression, while a combination of I3C and tamoxifen inhibited MCF7 cell growth more stringently than either agent alone. The I3C-mediated cell cycle arrest and repression of CDK6 production were also observed in estrogen receptor-deficient MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, which demonstrates that this indole can suppress the growth of mammary tumor cells independent of estrogen receptor signaling. Thus, our observations have uncovered a previously undefined antiproliferative pathway for I3C that implicates CDK6 as a target for cell cycle control in human breast cancer cells. Moreover, our results establish for the first time that CDK6 gene expression can be inhibited in response to an extracellular antiproliferative signal.

Moreover, our results establish for the first time that CDK6 gene expression can be inhibited in response to an extracellular antiproliferative signal. Considerable epidemiological evidence suggests that high vegetable diets correlate with low breast cancer risk (1Birt D.F. Pelling J.C. Nair S. Lepley D. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1996; 395: 223-234PubMed Google Scholar, 2Freudenheim J.L. Marshall J.R. Vena J.E. Laughlin R. Brasure J.R. Swanson M.K. Nemoto T. Graham S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is likely due to the diverse spectrum of dietary and environmental compounds that can regulate the function and proliferation of mammalian cells by influencing hormone receptor signal transduction pathways (3Meier C.A. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,4Hamel P.A. Hanley H.J. Cancer Invest. 1997; 15: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Several classes of these naturally occurring hormone-like chemicals have been implicated in the control of tumor cell growth and as chemopreventative agents. One such substance is the dietary compound indole-3-carbinol (I3C), 1The abbreviations used are: I3C, indole-3-carbinol; Ah, aromatic hydrocarbon; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CS, calf serum; DIM, 3,3′-diindolylmethane; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ICZ, indolo(3,2-b)carbazole; NFDM, nonfat dry milk; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Rb, retinoblastoma; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; IP, immunoprecipitation. an autolysis product of a glucosinolate, glucobrassicin, which occurs in Brassica vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts (5Loub W.D. Wattenberg L.W. Davis D.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1975; 54: 985-988PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wattenberg L.W. Loub W.D. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 1410-1413PubMed Google Scholar). A recent screen of 90 potential chemopreventative agents in a series of six short term bioassays relevant to carcinogen-induced DNA damage, oxidative stress, and tumor initiation and promotion, revealed I3C to be one of only eight compounds effective in all assays (7Sharma S. Stutzman J.D. Kelloff G.J. Steele V.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5848-5855PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that exposure to dietary I3C markedly reduces the incidence of spontaneous and carcinogen-induced mammary tumors in rodents (8Morse M.A. LaGreca S.D. Amin S.G. Chung F.L. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2613-2617PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bradlow H.L. Michnovicz J. Telang N.T. Osborne M.P. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For example, I3C administered in the diet or by oral intubation prior to treatment with carcinogen reduced the incidence of 7,12-dimethyl-benz(a)anthracene-induced mammary tumors in rodents by 70–90% (6Wattenberg L.W. Loub W.D. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 1410-1413PubMed Google Scholar, 10Grubbs C.J. Steele V.E. Casebolt T. Juliana M.M. Eto I. Whitaker L.M. Dragnev K.H. Kelloff G.J. Lubet R.L. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 709-716PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, dietary supplementation with cabbage or broccoli, vegetables that are good sources of I3C, also resulted in decreased mammary tumor formation in 7,12-dimethyl-benz(a)anthracene-treated rats (11Wattenberg L.W. Basic Life Sci. 1990; 52: 155-166PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in a long term feeding experiment, in which female mice consumed synthetic diets containing I3C, spontaneous mammary tumor incidence and multiplicity were reduced by 50% and tumor latency was prolonged compared with untreated control animals (9Bradlow H.L. Michnovicz J. Telang N.T. Osborne M.P. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). I3C also has anticarcinogenic effects on other cancer types, such as hepatic tumors (12Shertzer H.G. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1984; 48: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and can reduce benzo(a)pyrene-induced neoplasia of the forestomach (6Wattenberg L.W. Loub W.D. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 1410-1413PubMed Google Scholar). I3C has been shown to have an antiestrogenic activity in vivo, which has been proposed to account for some of its protective and antiproliferative effects on mammary tumor formation. Part of this effect may be due to alterations in estrogen metabolism, since oral administration of I3C to humans increased estradiol 2-hydroxylation by approximately 50% in both men and women (13Michnovicz J.J. Bradlow H.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 947-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and also increased the levels of estradiol hydroxylation activity in female rats (14Jellinck P.H. Forkert P.G. Riddick D.S. Okey A.B. Michnovicz J.J. Bradlow H.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition, I3C was shown to block the estradiol-induced proliferation of long term confluent cultures of human breast cancer cells (15Tiwari R.K. Guo L. Bradlow H.L. Telang N.T. Osborne M.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A major complication in interpreting the physiological results is that I3C is extremely unstable in acidic solution and does not withstand exposure to the low pH environment of the stomach (16De K.C. Marsman J.W. Venekamp J.C. Falke H.E. Noordhoek J. Blaauboer B.J. Wortelboer H.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1991; 80: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A relatively large fraction of I3C is converted into several acid-catalyzed derivatives with distinct biological activities that appear to mediate the antiestrogenic effects of I3C. Two of the most active acid products of I3C that have been identified are 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM) and indolo(3,2-b)carbazole (ICZ) (17Bjeldanes L.F. Kim J.Y. Grose K.R. Bartholomew J.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9543-9547Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). A general picture has emerged indicating that many of the long term antiestrogenic biological activities of I3C probably result from the actions of one or more of its acid-catalyzed derivatives (17Bjeldanes L.F. Kim J.Y. Grose K.R. Bartholomew J.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9543-9547Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 18Grose K.R. Bjeldanes L.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). ICZ appears to mediate its antiestrogenic effects by the direct binding to the Ah receptor (aromatic hydrocarbon or dioxin receptor), inducing cytochrome P450 CYP1A1 gene expression (19Chen Y.-H. Riby J. Srivastava P. Bartholomew J. Denison M. Bjeldanes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22548-22555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which can alter estrogen metabolism, thereby effectively decreasing the amount of circulating estrogen. This reduction in circulating estrogen leads to the decreased growth of estrogen-responsive mammary tissue and, presumably, a protective effect against breast cancer. ICZ exhibits only a very weak affinity for the ER but is the most potent Ah receptor agonist among the characterized I3C acid-catalyzed derivative compounds. In contrast, I3C has approximately 100,000-fold lower affinity for the Ah receptor compared with ICZ (Kd of 190 pm) and 3000-fold lower affinity compared with DIM (Kd of 90 nm) (17Bjeldanes L.F. Kim J.Y. Grose K.R. Bartholomew J.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9543-9547Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that I3C mediates its activities directly through the Ah receptor, and conceivably this dietary indole may exert many of its direct growth-inhibitory effects through a signal transduction pathway distinct from the antiestrogenic effects of its acid-catalyzed products. However, virtually nothing is known about the mechanism by which I3C mediates its antiproliferative effects on human breast cancer cells. The I3C-regulated cellular processes are likely to be complex, however, because both estrogen-independent and estrogen-dependent pathways may potentially be under indole control. Analogous to most other antiproliferative signaling molecules in mammalian cells, the I3C growth suppression pathway probably targets specific components and stages within the cell cycle. The eukaryotic cell cycle is composed of four phases (G1 (gap 1), DNA synthesis (S), G2 (gap 2), and mitosis (M)) as well as an out of cycle quiescent phase designated G0. In normal mammary epithelial cells, an intricate network of growth-inhibitory and -stimulatory signals are transduced from the extracellular environment and converge on G1-acting components, which, through their concerted actions, stringently regulate cell cycle progression (20Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4977) Google Scholar,21Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The final targets of these growth signaling pathways are specific sets of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) protein complexes, which function at specific, but overlapping, stages of the cell cycle (22van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 23Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 24Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). An active CDK complex phosphorylates retinoblastoma (Rb) protein family members. Rb and its related proteins sequester the E2F transcription factor, and the phosphorylation of Rb proteins by the active CDKs releases E2F, which then induces the expression of genes involved in the initiation of DNA synthesis (25Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Ewen M. Sellers W.R. Arany Z. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 742-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the G1 phase of the cell cycle, certain cyclins (C, D1, D2, D3, E) are necessary for activation the G1 CDKs (CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6), while, in a complementary manner, several of the small proteins associated with cyclin-CDK complexes (p15, p16/Ink4a, p21/Waf1/Cip1, p27/Kip1, p57/Kip2) have been shown to act as specific inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase activity (26Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 27Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M.

The loss of normal cell cycle control in G1 has been implicated in mammary tumor development and proliferation. Up to 45% of human breast cancers show an aberrant expression and/or amplification of cyclin D1 or cyclin E (30Buckley M.F. Sweeney K.J. Hamilton J.A. Sini R.L. Manning D.L. Nicholson R.I. deFazio A.

A. 1993; 90: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In other studies, inappropriate expression and/or mutation of certain G1-acting proto-oncogenes, growth factors, and their cognate receptors has been observed in both human and rodent mammary tumor cells (31Keyomarsi K. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 32Schuuring E. Verhoeven E. Mooi W.J. Michalides R.J.

Furthermore, many tumors exhibit a loss in expression or function of certain tumor suppressor genes (such as p53), which modulate cell cycle events late in the G1 phase (34Norberg T. Jansson T. Sjogren S. Martensson C. Andreasson I. Fjallskog M.L. Lindman H. Nordgren H. Lindgren A. Holmberg L. Bergh J. Acta Oncol. 1996; 5: 96-102Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar,35Hartmann A. Blaszyk H. Kovach J.S. Sommer S.S. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Regulated changes in the expression and/or activity of cell cycle components that act within G1 have been closely associated with alterations in the proliferation rate of normal and transformed mammary epithelial cells (4Hamel P.A. Hanley H.J. Cancer Invest. 1997; 15: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For example, the estrogen-induced activation of CDK4 and CDK2 during progression of human breast cancer cells between the G1 and S phases is accompanied by the increased expression of cyclin D1 and decreased association of the CDK inhibitors with the cyclin E-CDK2 complex (36Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In rat tumor cells derived from 7,12-dimethyl-benz(a)anthracene-induced mammary adenocarcinomas, glucocorticoids induce a G1 cell cycle arrest and alter expression of cell cycle-regulated genes (37Goya L. Maiyar A.C. Ge Y. Firestone G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed likely that dietary indoles control the emergence and proliferation of breast cancer cells by regulating G1-acting cell cycle components in mammary epithelial cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the dietary indole I3C, but not the acid-catalyzed derivative DIM or ICZ, inhibits the growth of human MCF7 breast cancer cells and induces a G1 cell cycle arrest in an ER-independent manner. Strikingly, this growth arrest is accompanied by the selective inhibition in expression of CDK6 transcripts, CDK6 protein, and the activity of CDK6, which correlates with a decrease in endogenous Rb phosphorylation. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), calf serum (CS), calcium-free and magnesium-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS), l-glutamine, and trypsin-EDTA were supplied by BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Insulin (Bovine), 17β-estradiol, and tamoxifen ((Z)-1-(p-dimethylaminoethoxyphenyl)-1,2-diphenyl-1-butene) citrate salt were obtained from Sigma. [3H]Thymidine (84 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) was purchased from Aldrich. I3C was recrystallized in hot toluene prior to use, while ICZ and DIM were prepared and purified as described (17Bjeldanes L.F. Kim J.Y. Grose K.R. Bartholomew J.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9543-9547Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The sources of other reagents used in the study are either listed in the following methods or were of the highest purity available. The human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). MCF7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 μg/ml insulin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Both cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2 at subconfluency. I3C, tamoxifen, and estradiol were dissolved in Me2SO (99.9% HPLC grade, Aldrich) at concentrations 1000-fold higher than the final medium concentration. In all experiments, 1 μl of the concentrated agent was added per ml of medium, and for the vehicle control, 1 μl of Me2SO was added per ml of medium. Breast cancer cells were plated onto 24-well Corning tissue culture dishes. Triplicate samples of asynchronously growing mammary cells were treated for the indicated times with either vehicle control (1 μl of Me2SO/ml of medium) or varying concentrations of I3C, estradiol, and/or tamoxifen. The cells were pulsed for 3 h with 3 μCi of [3H]thymidine (84 Ci/mmol), washed three times with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and lysed with 300 μl of 0.3n NaOH. Lysates (150 μl) were transferred into vials containing liquid scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. Triplicates were averaged and expressed as counts/min/well. Breast cancer cells (4 × 104) were plated onto Corning six-well tissue culture dishes. A final concentration of 100 μm I3C was added to three of the wells, and vehicle control (1 μl of Me2SO/ml of medium) was added to the other three. The medium was changed every 24 h. Cells were incubated for 96 h and hypotonically lysed in 1 ml of DNA staining solution (0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.05% Triton X-100). Nuclear emitted fluorescence with wavelength greater than 585 nm was measured with a Coulter Elite instrument with laser output adjusted to deliver 15 milliwatts at 488 nm. Nuclei (10,000) were analyzed from each sample at a rate of 300–500 cells/s. The percentages of cells within the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined by analysis with the Multicycle computer program provided by Phoenix Flow Systems in the Cancer Research Laboratory Microchemical Facility of the University of California, Berkeley. After the indicated treatments, cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mmNaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml NaF, 10 μg/ml β-glycerophosphate). Equal amounts of total cellular protein were mixed with loading buffer (25% glycerol, 0.075% SDS, 1.25% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% bromphenol blue, 3.13% stacking gel buffer) and fractionated by electrophoresis on 10% (7.5% for Rb) polyacrylamide, 0.1% SDS resolving gels. Rainbow marker (Amersham Life Sciences) was used as the molecular weight standard. Proteins were electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations, Inc., Westboro, MA) and blocked overnight at 4 °C with Western wash buffer and 5% NFDM (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk) (PBS, 5% nonfat dry milk for Rb). Blots were subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature for rabbit anti-CDK2, -CDK4, -CDK6, and -ER antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), catalog numbers sc-163, sc-260, sc-177, and sc-543, respectively), 2 h at room temperature for goat anti-p21, rabbit anti-cyclin E, and rabbit anti-p27 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog numbers sc-397, sc-198, and sc-528, respectively), and overnight at 4 °C for mouse anti-cyclin D1 and mouse anti-Rb antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-246; Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), catalog number 14001A, respectively). Working concentration for all antibodies was 1 μg/ml Western wash buffer (PBS for Rb). Immunoreactive proteins were detected after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted to 3 × 10−4 in Western wash buffer, 1% NFDM (goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad); rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Zymed, San Francisco, CA); donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)). Blots were treated with ECL reagents (NEN Life Science Products), and all proteins were detected by autoradiography. Equal protein loading was ascertained by Ponceau S staining of blotted membranes. Breast cancer cells were cultured for 0, 15, 24, 48, or 96 h in growth medium with or without 100 μm I3C and then rinsed twice with PBS, harvested, and stored as dry pellets at −70 °C. For the immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed for 15 min in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml NaF, 10 μg/ml β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Samples were diluted to 500 μg of protein in 1 ml of IP buffer, and samples were precleared for 2 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppasala, Sweden) in IP buffer and 1 μg of rabbit IgG. After a brief centrifugation to remove precleared beads, 0.5 μg of anti-CDK6 antibody was added to each sample and incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 2 h. Then 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were added to each sample, and the slurries were incubated on the rocking platform at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were then washed five times with IP buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 μg/ml NaF, 10 μg/ml β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Half of the immunoprecipitated sample was checked by Western blot analysis to confirm the immunoprecipitation. For the kinase assay, the other half of the immunoprecipitated sample was resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.21 μg of Rb carboxyl-terminal domain protein substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-4112), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding an equal volume of 2 × loading buffer (10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 6.25 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, and bromphenol blue). Reaction products were boiled for 10 min and then electrophoretically fractionated in SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to monitor loading and destained overnight with 3% glycerol. Subsequently, gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from MCF7 cells treated with either 100 μm I3C or vehicle control (1 μl of Me2SO/ml of medium) for 5 or 15 h as described previously (38Sanchez I. Goya L. Vallerga A.K. Firestone G.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 215-225PubMed Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was electrophoretically fractionated in 6% formaldehyde, 1% agarose gels, transferred onto Nytran nylon membranes (Schleicher and Schuell), and UV-cross-linked in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes were preannealed with 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA in hybridization buffer (5 × Denhardt's reagent, 5 × SSC, 50% formamide) and subsequently hybridized for 16–20 h with cDNA probes [α-32P]dCTP-labeled by random primer extension (Boehringer Mannheim). For detection of CDK6 transcripts, the cDNA probe was added to the hybridization buffer at a concentration of 6 million cpm/ml. CDK6 membranes were washed twice for 10 min with 2 × SSC at room temperature followed by two 1-h-long washes with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. For detection of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), CDK2, and CDK4 transcripts, the cDNA probe was added to the hybridization buffer at a concentration of 2 million cpm/ml. These membranes were subsequently washed with 2 × SSC twice at room temperature for 10 min followed by two 30-min washes at 60 °C in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. The membranes were placed under film and analyzed after 4-h to 6-day exposures at −80 °C. CDK2, -4, and -6 transcripts were detected using purified BamHI fragments of the pCMVcdk2, pCMVcdk4, or pCMVcdk6 plasmids containing the respective cDNA for each of the CDKs. The CDK plasmids were a generous gift from Ed Harlow's laboratory as described (39Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). GAPDH transcripts were detected with a 560-base pair XbaI/HinD III cDNA fragment of the corresponding cDNA. Autoradiographic exposures were scanned with a UMAX UC630 scanner and band intensities were quantified using the NIH Image program. Autoradiographs from a minimum of three independent experiments were scanned per time point. Subconfluent breast cancer cells were propagated for at least 1 week in either low (5% CS) or high serum (10% FBS) containing medium prior to plating onto 60-mm Corning dishes 24 h before transfection in the appropriate medium. DNA-lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) mixtures were prepared by mixing 1 μg of ERE-vit-CAT reporter (−596 to +21 of theXenopus laevis vitellogenin B1 genomic clone plus a consensus estrogen response element (ERE) subcloned into theHindIII site upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in the SVOCAT vector, a generous gift from D. J. Shapiro (University of Illinois)) with 5 μl of lipofectamine in a total volume of 100 μl for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, and 100 μl of the liposome complex was added to each plate. After a 5-h incubation at 37 °C, the transfection was terminated by adding an equal volume of 2 × media containing either 10% CS or 20% FBS. Complete medium was replaced 18–24 h post-transfection, at which time appropriate agents (e.g. estrogen, tamoxifen, and I3C) were added. pCAT-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), which contains the promoterless CAT cDNA, was used as a negative control to determine background CAT activity. Cells were harvested by washing in PBS, resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles, 5 min/cycle. Cell lysates were heated at 68 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 1.4 × 104 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant fractions were recovered. CAT activity in the cell extracts containing 20–50 μg of lysate protein was measured by a quantitative nonchromatographic assay (40Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. Biotechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar). The enzyme assay was carried out in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm aqueous chloramphenicol, and 1 μCi of [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (final reaction volume of 250 μl). The reaction mixture was overlaid with 4 ml of Econofluor scintillation fluorochrome (NEN Life Science Products). CAT activity was monitored by direct measurement of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Measurements of CAT activity were in the linear range of the assay as determ"

In this report we show that the cells can be made susceptible to the apoptotic effect of TNF-α when pretreated with actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or vanadate. c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) has been thought to mediate apoptotic processes elicited by some stimuli, but its involvement in TNF-α-induced apoptosis has been controversial. JNK activation was investigated under conditions where the mesangial cells were either resistant or susceptible to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. TNF-α alone stimulated a single transient JNK activity peak. However, when the cells were pretreated with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, TNF-α stimulated a second sustained JNK activity peak. When the cells were pretreated with the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate, TNF-α-induced JNK activation was greatly prolonged. In all three cases, a sustained JNK activation was associated with the initiation of apoptosis. Our data suggest that a sustained activation of JNK induced by these reagents may be associated with blocking the expression of a phosphatase that inactivates JNK. Further studies reveal that the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) was induced by TNF-α, indicating that MKP-1 may be involved in protecting the cells from apoptosis by preventing a prolonged activation of JNK under normal conditions. Additional studies showed that extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase activation stimulated by TNF-α was unlikely to contribute to the resistance of mesangial cells to TNF-α cytotoxicity.

It elicits a wide range of biological responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, depending on the cell type and its state of differentiation (1Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Most cells express specific receptors for TNF-α. Two receptors have been characterized, designated as TNF-α receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF-α receptor 2 (TNFR2). After binding to these receptors, TNF-α elicits multiple signal transduction pathways that regulate different cellular processes (2Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Many tumor cells are sensitive to TNF-α-induced apoptosis, but normal cells are usually resistant. Some cells undergo apoptosis only when they are treated with TNF-α in the presence of other agents or when the cells are damaged (3Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1778-1788PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sugarman B.J. Aggarwal B.B. Hass P.E. Figari I.S. Palladino Jr., M.A. Shepard H.M.

The well characterized morphological changes in the cells that undergo apoptosis include cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic blebbing, and DNA digestion. Recently, activation of interleukin 1-converting enzyme (ICE)-related proteases have been implicated as the “executors of the cell death” at the onset stage of the apoptotic process (6Li Y. Zhang W. Mantell L.L. Kazzaz J.A. Fein A.M. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20646-20649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the initial events in the signal transduction pathway responsible for the later phases of cell death are poorly understood. Among these signaling pathways, activation of transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos (components of the AP-1 transcription complex) and NF-κB are among the early cellular responses. After phosphorylation, c-Fos and c-Jun form a heterodimer to produce an active AP-1 transcription complex. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinase) are among the protein kinases that are responsible for the phosphorylation of c-Fos and c-Jun (7Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, three distinct subtypes have been identified in the MAP kinase family: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases (JNK), and p38 kinases. JNK and p38 kinases are strongly activated by extra- or intracellular stress and inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α (8Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1997; 18: 567-577Crossref Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 9Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). It is thought that activation of JNK and p38 kinases generally promotes an inhibition of cell growth or promotion of cell death, whereas ERK is usually strongly activated by growth factors and hormones that stimulate cell growth and is, therefore, involved in the regulation of cell proliferation (9Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 10Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Strong and prolonged activation of JNK has been reported in response to a variety of stresses including UV light, ionizing irradiation, and hydrogen peroxide, any of which can trigger apoptosis (11Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 12Butterfield L. Storey B. Maas L. Heasley L.E. J.

Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 606-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Because TNF-α strongly activates JNK but only weakly stimulates ERK in many cells, it is postulated that JNK activation is involved in TNF-α-induced apoptosis (14Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 15Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A.

Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). However, several reports show that activation of JNK can be mediated through a noncytotoxic TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2 pathway initiated by TNF-α, which is not linked to apoptosis (2Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar, 18Natoli G. Costanzo A. Ianni A. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. Balsano C. Levrero M. Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 19Reinhard C. Shamoon B. Shyamala V. Williams L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1080-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The role of the JNK pathway in TNF-α-induced signaling, therefore requires further elucidation. NF-κB is a transcription factor present as a heterodimer complexed with I-κB in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. Upon cell stimulation, I-κB is phosphorylated and degraded, resulting in the release of NF-κB, which is translocated to the nucleus where it initiates transcription activity (20Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). TNF-α is known to induce NF-κB activation. Initially, it was thought that NF-κB activation was involved in apoptosis induced by TNF-α until more recent findings suggested that activation of NF-κB by TNF-α stimulates the synthesis of a survival factor, which protects the cell from apoptosis (21Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 94-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 23Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). This hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the reason why some cells, notably primary cells, are resistant to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, the putative protective factor has not been identified, and the role of NF-κB activation in the overall progress of apoptosis has not been resolved. Mesangial cells are a prominent cell type in the glomerulus, and they take part in the regulation of glomerular hemodynamics. They produce inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and are involved in the uptake and clearance of immune complexes from the glomeruli by phagocytosis (24Davies M. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 320-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cell death from apoptosis is prominent during the course of various renal diseases as well as in the early stages of kidney development. In the present study, the cytotoxic effect of TNF-α on rat mesangial cells has been investigated. Our results show that although TNF-α activated JNK, ERK, and NF-κB, it was unable, by itself, to induce apoptosis. However, under conditions when JNK was activated in a sustained fashion, the cells underwent apoptosis. Of particular interest, our data suggest that a sustained activation of JNK may be associated with a diminished amount or activity of a phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK, thereby triggering apoptosis. Recombinant TNF-α was obtained from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Anti-ERK2, anti-I-κB-α, and anti-NF-κB antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63), anti-phospho-JNK antibodies were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-c-Jun antibodies were from Oncogene (Uniondale, NY), and anti-phospho-ERK was from Promega (Madison, WI). Myelin basic protein (MBP) and PD098059 were purchased from Sigma. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay kit was from Boehringer Mannheim. Rat mesangial cells were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats under sterile conditions using the sieving technique as described (25Kreisberg J.I. Hoover R.L. Karnovsky M.J. Kidney Int. 1978; 14: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum and 0.6 unit/ml insulin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air). Cells from 5–20 passages were used. After the cells were grown to 80–90% confluence, they were made quiescent by incubation for 16–18 h in insulin-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. For cell viability assays, mesangial cells were grown in 12-well plates. The quiescent cells were treated with reagents for the indicated times. Uptake of neutral red dye was used as a measurement of cell viability (26Skehan P. Cell Growth and Apoptosis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1995: 179-180Google Scholar). At the end of the incubations, the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal calf serum containing 0.001% neutral red for 90 min at 37 °C. The uptake of the dye by viable cells was terminated by removal of the media, washing the cells briefly with 1 ml 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and solubilizing the internalized dye with 1 ml of a solution containing 50% ethanol and 1% glacial acetic acid. The absorbances, which correlate with the amount of live cells, were determined at 540 nm. During the cell incubations cell morphology was also examined under a light microscope. Cells grown on 25-mm glass coverslips in six-well plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, after treatment with various reagents as indicated. DNA strand breaks were identified using a modified TUNEL assay kit. Briefly, the fixed cells were treated with terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase, which incorporates fluorescein-tagged nucleotides onto 3′-OH termini of fragmented DNA. This was then visualized by adding anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase followed by diaminobenzidine. The positively stained dark colored nuclei were analyzed under a light microscope. Phosphorylation of c-Jun was detected with anti-phospho-c-Jun antibodies essentially following the immunocytochemistry protocol provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The quiescent cells were treated with reagents for the indicated times, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped into cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mmpyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 30 min on ice with periodic vortexing and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was designated as cell lysate. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using BSA as standard (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The gelatinous pellets that contained nuclei and cytoskeleton components were extracted with SDS sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The extract was designated as crude nuclear fraction. JNK activity was measured using a solid phase kinase assay method. GST-c-Jun(1–79) (GST-Jun) fusion protein was isolated from bacterial cells expressing pGEX-c-Jun plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. J. K. Westwick). GST-Jun bound to glutathione-agarose beads was used to affinity purify JNK. JNK activity was determined using GST-Jun as substrate (28Westwick J.K. Brenner D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 342-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 2 μg of GST-Jun-agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 1 min. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm NaF). The beads were then resuspended in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing as final concentration 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer followed by heating at 100 °C for 3 min. The proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. The kinase activity was quantified by scintillation counting of the radioactivity in the phospho-GST-Jun bands excised from the gels. In-gel JNK assays were performed as described (29Guo Y.-L. Roux S.J. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The enzyme samples were added to SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) except that GST-Jun (20 μg/ml) was added to the running gel solution before polymerization. SDS was removed by washing the gel three times with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl for 30 min at room temperature immediately after electrophoresis. The enzyme was allowed to renature in the washing buffer containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C overnight. The gel was then incubated in the kinase reaction buffer as described above for 3–5 h with gentle shaking. The reaction was stopped by adding a solution containing 5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) and 1% (w/v) sodium pyrophosphate. The gel was washed extensively with the same solution, dried, and autoradioraphed. ERK activity was measured by the immunocomplex assay method. 100 μg of whole cell lysate was incubated with 1.5 μl of polyclonal anti-ERK2 serum for 1.5 h at 4 °C with rotation followed by addition of 5 μl of protein A-agarose beads (50%). The suspension was further incubated for 1 h. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with washing buffer as for JNK purification. The ERK activity was determined under the same condition as for JNK assays except that GST-Jun was replaced with 2 μg of MBP as substrate. ERK activation was also determined by a gel shift assay (31Lubinus M. Meier K.E. Smith E.A. Gause K.C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9822-9825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The appearance of a slower migrating band on the gel caused by phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues of ERK2 was used as an indication of its activation. The protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunnoblots were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit obtained from Amersham. Total RNA was isolated from mesangial cells using TRI-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (32Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).HindIII/BamHI fragment of pCEP4-MKP-1 (MAP kinase phosphatase-1) plasmid (kindly provided by Drs. N. Tonks and H. Sun) was used as a probe. Mesangial cells are essentially insensitive to TNF-α cytotoxicity at a concentration of 10 ng/ml (Fig. 1), which is sufficient to induce apoptosis in susceptible cells (4Sugarman B.J. Aggarwal B.B. Hass P.E. Figari I.S. Palladino Jr., M.A. Shepard H.M. Science. 1985; 230: 943-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 17Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J.

Prolonged incubation of mesangial cells with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 48 h showed little deterioration of cell viability. However, when the cells were pretreated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, cell viability was decreased dramatically (Fig. 1). The cells did not show demonstrable signs of apoptosis after they were treated with TNF-α, actinomycin D, or cycloheximide alone. Cell death resulting from preincubation with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide followed by TNF-α stimulation showed typical characteristics of apoptosis as examined under a microscope and as determined by the TUNEL analysis. At the end of the 4-h incubation, more than 50% of the cells attached to the coverslips were TUNEL staining-positive when the cells were pretreated with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide followed by stimulation with TNF-α, whereas under the same conditions only 5% of the cells were TUNEL staining-positive when the cells were treated with TNF-α only. This is the same as for the control experiments where the cells were not treated with any reagent. These results indicate that mesangial cells are normally resistant to TNF-α-induced apoptosis with this resistance depending on de novo protein synthesis, a property shown by other nontransformed cell types (3Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1778-1788PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sugarman B.J. Aggarwal B.B. Hass P.E. Figari I.S. Palladino Jr., M.A. Shepard H.M. Science. 1985; 230: 943-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis induced by various stimuli (12Butterfield L. Storey B. Maas L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10110-10116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Zanke B.W. Boudreau K. Rubie E. Winnett E. Tibbles L.A. Zon L.

Two protein kinases with molecular masses of 54 and 46 kDa were activated by TNF-α as detected by an in-gel assay when GST-Jun was used as substrate in mesangial cells. They were identified as JNK2 and JNK1, respectively, based on their molecular weights. Their identities were further confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-JNK antibodies that only recognized the activated JNK1 and JNK2 (data not shown). To investigate if there was a correlation between JNK activity and cell viability, the time course of JNK activation was determined in cells after treatment with TNF-α. As shown in Fig.2 A, the activation of JNK by TNF-α was very transient. Maximal activation was reached within 15 min, giving a 5–10 fold-stimulation, which diminished to the basal level by 30 min. However, when the cells were pretreated with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, a second JNK activation peak was detected. In the case of actinomycin D, the second activity peak started at 2 h and lasted at least for another hour with increased activity (Fig. 2 B). In the case of cycloheximide, the second activity peak started at 3 h after the addition of TNF-α with a lower level of activation compared with the effect of actinomycin D (Fig. 2 C). In addition to inducing the second peak of JNK activation, cycloheximide also potentiated the duration of the first TNF-α-induced activity peak of JNK compared with TNF-α alone as a control (Fig. 2 A). The second activity peak of JNK was not caused directly by actinomycin D or cycloheximide because neither treatment had a significant effect on JNK activity (Figs. 2, B and C, lower panels). Although it is reported that cycloheximide by itself activates JNK in some cells (15Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar), its effect on mesangial cells was rather weak. A similar result was also reported by Liu et al. in rat mesangial cells (34Liu Z.-H. Striker G.E. Stetler-Stevenson M. Fukushima P. Patel A. Striker L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1595-C1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effects of actinomycin D and cycloheximide on steps downstream of JNK, the phosphorylation state of c-Jun was examined by using antibodies that were able to recognize only phospho-c-Jun. As shown in Fig. 3, at the end of 3 h of incubation, about 90% of the cells were heavily stained with anti-phospho-c-Jun when the cells were pretreated with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide followed by stimulation with TNF-α, whereas under the same conditions, treatment of the cells with TNF-α, actinomycin D, or cycloheximide alone only showed a slight effect on c-Jun phosphorylation. The increased activity of JNK and phosphorylation of c-Jun caused by TNF-α in the presence of actinomycin D or cycloheximide after a 3-h incubation corresponded to the onset of apoptosis (Fig. 1). From the above data it appeared that a sustained JNK activation was necessary for the induction of apoptosis, whereas activation of JNK by TNF-α alone in mesangial cells was too transient to initiate the apoptotic process. To determine whether a sustained JNK activation is able to render the cells susceptible to TNF-α cytotoxicity using other approaches, mesangial cells were pretreated with two protein phosphatase inhibitors, vanadate and okadaic acid, which are known to inhibit the tyrosine phosphatases and type 1/type 2A serine/threonine phosphatases, respectively. These treatments presumably would inactivate protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate JNK, thereby prolonging the activation of JNK by TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 4, whereas pretreatment of the cells with okadaic acid (Fig. 4 B) slightly potentiated the duration of JNK activation stimulated by TNF-α, pretreatment of the cells with vanadate (Fig. 4 C) dramatically prolonged TNF-α-induced JNK activation. Control experiments showed that okadaic acid alone had little effect on JNK activity, but vanadate alone activated JNK about 2-fold. These results indicate that inactivation of JNK occurs mainly by a vanadate-sensitive tyrosine phosphatase. The phosphorylation state of c-Jun was examined by Western blot analysis using antibodies that were able to recognize only c-Jun or phospho-c-Jun. As shown in Fig. 5, the phosphorylation of c-Jun correlated well with the duration of JNK activity observed in Fig. 4. Pretreatment of the cells with okadaic acid prolonged the phosphorylation state of c-Jun during stimulation by TNF-α for up to 1 h, whereas pretreatment of the cells with vanadate followed by stimulation with TNF-α caused the phosphorylation of c-Jun to last for at least 3 h. Interestingly, under this condition, phospho-c-Jun was recognized as a doublet that represents phosphorylation at multiple sites, causing a retardation of the protein band attributed to hyperphosphorylation of c-Jun (35Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid alone did not cause significant phosphorylation of c-Jun, whereas vanadate alone caused a sustained c-Jun phosphorylation, without the hyperphosphorylated band being detected (Fig.5 D). To investigate whether there was a correlation between the duration of JNK activation and cell viability, the mesangial cells were incubated with TNF-α in the presence of okadaic acid and vanadate. As shown in Fig.6, preincubation of the cells with okadaic acid followed by stimulation with TNF-α had no effect on cell viability. In contrast, pretreatment of the cells with vanadate followed by TNF-α stimulation dramatically increased cell death. Cells that were treated with vanadate alone also resulted in significant cell death (Fig. 6). It should be noted that vanadate alone also caused JNK activation at a low level (∼3-fold) but in a sustained manner, in conjunction with a sustained phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 5). Cells from parallel experiments were examined for apoptosis by the TUNEL analysis. Under the conditions tested, only the cells treated with vanadate or vanadate plus TNF-α showed the morphological characteristic of apoptosis. At the end of the 4-h incubation period, about 25% of the cells attached to the coverslips were TUNEL staining-positive when the cells were treated with vanadate alone, and 35% of the cells were TUNEL staining-positive when treated with vanadate and TNF-α. Only 5–7% of the cells were TUNEL staining-positive when the cells were treated with okadaic acid alone or in combination with TNF-α. These results indicate that cell death resulted from apoptosis and was paralleled by a sustained activation of JNK and c-Ju"
https://openalex.org/W2110184627,"We recently reported that macrophages and fibroblasts secrete a Zn2+-dependent sphingomyelinase (S-SMase), which, like lysosomal SMase, is a product of the acid SMase gene. S-SMase may cause subendothelial retention and aggregation of lipoproteins during atherogenesis, and the acid SMase gene has been implicated in ceramide-mediated cell signaling, especially involving apoptosis of endothelial cells. Because of the central importance of the endothelium in each of these processes, we now sought to examine the secretion and regulation of S-SMase by vascular endothelial cells. Herein we show that cultured human coronary artery and umbilical vein endothelial cells secrete massive amounts of S-SMase (up to 20-fold more than macrophages). Moreover, whereas S-SMase secreted by macrophages and fibroblasts is almost totally dependent on the addition of exogenous Zn2+, endothelium-derived S-SMase was partially active even in the absence of added Zn2+. Secretion of S-SMase by endothelial cells occurred both apically and basolaterally, suggesting an endothelial contribution to both serum and arterial wall SMase. When endothelial cells were incubated with inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma, S-SMase secretion by endothelial cells was increased 2-3-fold above the already high level of basal secretion, whereas lysosomal SMase activity was decreased. The mechanism of interleukin-1beta-stimulated secretion appears to be through increased routing of a SMase precursor protein through the secretory pathway. In summary, endothelial cells are a rich and regulatable source of enzymatically active S-SMase, suggesting physiologic and pathophysiologic roles for this enzyme."

A gene encoding a novel enoyl-SCoA hydratase/lyase enzyme for the hydration and nonoxidative cleavage of feruloyl-SCoA to vanillin and acetyl-SCoA was isolated and characterized from a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens.

The gene product is a member of the enoyl-SCoA hydratase/isomerase superfamily. Cinnamic acids are biologically important and abundant molecules; for example, ferulic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-trans-cinnamic acid) and 4-coumaric acid (4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid) together represent up to 1.5% by weight of the cell walls of grasses (1Hartley R.D. Jones E.C. Phytochemistry. 1977; 16: 1531-1534Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). They function in the cross-linking of plant cell walls and are precursors of a variety of antimicrobial compounds, signaling molecules, and phytoalexins that play an important role in plant defense responses (2Dixon R.A. Paiva N.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). They are precursors of lignin in wood (3Whetten R. Sederoff R. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and, by contrast, of simple molecules such as vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) and salicylic acid (2-hydroxybenzoic acid). Because they are released during the breakdown of lignin and cell wall material, their catabolism is essential to the biodegradation of plant wastes. There is substantial interest in the potential of ferulic acid and related compounds as feedstocks, for example, for the biotechnological production of vanillin, one of the principal flavoring and aroma compounds in the world (4Rosazza J.P.N. Huang Z. Dostal L. Volm T. Rousseau B. J. Indust. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 5Hagedorn S. Kaphammer B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 773-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The degradation of these molecules is not well understood. It was proposed (6Zenk M.H. Rec. Adv. Phytochem. 1979; 12: 139-176Google Scholar) that the chain shortening of cinnamic acids might occur via a β-oxidation process directly analogous to the well known β-oxidation pathway of fatty acid oxidation. The proposed route for ferulic acid is shown in Fig. 1. Key steps in this scheme are activation to the CoASH thioester, hydration of the enoyl-SCoA to the β-hydroxy derivative, β-oxidation to the β-keto thioester, and thioclastic cleavage to give the corresponding benzoyl-SCoA (vanilloyl-SCoA) together with acetyl-SCoA. The aldehyde, vanillin, would be formed by reduction of vanilloyl-SCoA. Although it is known that an overall two-carbon cleavage of ferulic acid can occur to give vanillin or vanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid) together with an acetate unit, the mechanism of such a route, whether in plants or microorganisms, has proved surprisingly elusive, perhaps on account of the assumed low abundance or instability of reaction intermediates (4Rosazza J.P.N. Huang Z. Dostal L. Volm T. Rousseau B. J. Indust. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). in Pseudomonas acidovorans, for example, the overall conversion was demonstrated many years ago (7Toms A. Wood J.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 9: 337-343Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but no further investigation of the mechanism was reported subsequently. In the work reported here, the close relationship of hydroxycinnamate catabolism to the β-oxidation of fatty acids is fully confirmed and demonstrated. A gene encoding an enoyl-SCoA hydratase/lyase enzyme for the conversion of feruloyl-SCoA to vanillin and acetyl-SCoA was isolated from a Pseudomonas strain able to utilize ferulic acid as sole carbon source, 1Narbad, A., and Gasson, M. J. (1998)Microbiology, in press.and its function was confirmed by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. The gene product was shown to be a member of the enoyl-SCoA hydratase/isomerase superfamily (9Müller-Newen G. Janssen U. Stoffel W. Eur. J.

The gene encodes no NAD+ binding domain, and the enzyme does not exhibit β-oxidation activity. Chemicals were obtained routinely from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Ltd., Gillingham, Dorset, UK or from BDH-Merck, Poole, Dorset, UK and were of analytical grade. The preparation of CoASH thioesters (feruloyl-SCoA, vanilloyl-SCoA, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-β-hydroxypropionyl coenzyme A thioester (HMPHP SCoA) 2The abbreviations used are: HMPHP SCoA, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-β-hydroxypropionyl coenzyme A thioester; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; kb, kilobase(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s).) is described below. Restriction enzymes were routinely obtained from Promega, Southampton, UK. The isolation of Pseudomonas fluorescensbiovar V, strain AN103 by enrichment using ferulic acid as sole carbon source is described elsewhere.1 These were produced from ferulic acid and vanillic acid, respectively, essentially as described by Semler et al. (11Semler V. Schmidtberg G. Gross G.G. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 1070-1074Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) for piperoyl-SCoA, except that in the case of feruloyl-SCoA, the N-succinimidyl derivative was not isolated before transesterification with CoASH. Final isolation was by preparative TLC using cellulose TLC plates (Avicel; 1,000 μm; Analtech, Newark, DE) developed in n-butanol/acetic acid/H2O (5:2:3, v/v/v) (13Zenk M.H. Ulbrich B. Brusse J. Stöckigt J. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 101: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and elution with 50% MeOH. HMPHP SCoA was prepared starting from a Reformatsky condensation of vanillin with ethyl bromoacetate (12Shriner R.L. Adams R. Bachmann W.E. Fieser L.F. Johnson J.R. Snyder H.R. Organic Reactions. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1942: 1-37Google Scholar) followed by purification of the resulting ethyl 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-β-hydroxypropionate (ethyl HMPHP) by HPLC, hydrolysis to the free acid, N-succinimidylation and, finally, exchange of the N-succinimidyl group with CoASH and isolation of the CoASH thioester by preparative TLC. Vanillin (3 g) was mixed with 1.9 ml of ethyl bromoacetate and 2 g of dry zinc dust in 60 ml of dry 1,4-dioxane. The reaction mixture was heated to boiling using a heating mantle and refluxed gently for about 1 h. After being allowed to cool, the mixture was acidified with 60 ml of 10% H2SO4 and extracted with 4 × 120 ml of Et2O. The combined Et2O phases were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and unreacted vanillin was removed by washing with 3 × 100 ml of saturated K2S2O5. The ether phase was then rotary evaporated under vacuum at about 30 °C to remove the ether, leaving a liquid residue (about 10 ml). This was then applied to a preparative C-18 reverse phase HPLC column (Dynamax 60A, 8 μm, 250 × 41 mm; Rainin, Woburn, MA) and eluted at 12 ml min/min with a gradient of MeOH/H2O, containing 1 mmtrifluoroacetic acid. Solvent A comprised 40% MeOH and 1 mm trifluoroacetic acid. Solvent B comprised 100% MeOH and 1 mm trifluoroacetic acid. At time t = 0 min, the solvent was 20% B, rising linearly to 40% B at 28 min and 100% B at 35 min. Fractions were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm, and material eluting between 37 and 45 min was collected. The solvent was removed under vacuum at about 35 °C, and the remaining material brought to −20 °C overnight. The precipitate that formed was then filtered off rapidly and freeze-dried to give 300 mg of white substance. This was identified as ethyl HMPHP by mass spectrometry ([M−] = 239). To generate the N-succinimidyl ester, 30 mg of ethyl HMPHP was first hydrolyzed for 40 min at room temperature in 0.5 ml of 1m KOH and the pH adjusted to about 3–4 with 0.6 ml of 0.5m oxalic acid. The solution was extracted successively with Et2O (5 × about 10 ml) and the organic phases pooled and evaporated to dryness. N-Hydroxysuccinimide (0.1 mmol; 11.5 mg) was then added in 1.2 ml of dry 1,4-dioxane. This was followed gradually, with stirring, by 0.1 mmol (20.7 mg) of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in 0.6 ml of dry 1,4-dioxane. Subsequent steps were essentially those described above fortrans-feruloyl-SCoA, based on the procedure of Semleret al. (11Semler V. Schmidtberg G. Gross G.G. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 1070-1074Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Identification was confirmed by mass spectrometry ([M−] = 960) and by hydrolysis to the free acid (as with ethyl HMPHP). Cells were grown routinely at 25 °C on minimal medium, with shaking, using vanillic acid (10 mm) or ferulic acid (10 mm) as the sole carbon source; 50 ml of medium was used in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Nutrient medium (LB-Mod) was prepared as indicated by Narbad and Gasson.1 Growth was measured routinely by monitoring absorbance at 600 nm. Cell-free extracts of logarithmic phase cultures (6–10 h after inoculation) were prepared by sonication. Cells from about 200 ml of medium were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 5–10 ml of extraction buffer (routinely 40 mm KPi, pH 7, containing 10 mmdithiothreitol). They were then sonicated (MSE Soniprep 150; Fisons Instruments, Crawley, Sussex, UK) at 4 °C (5 × 20 s; 22 amplitude microns on full power) and centrifuged (20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C). For storage, extracts were frozen at −70 °C. In some instances, extracts were buffer changed using a PD-10 column (Pharmacia, Milton Keynes, UK) before use. Protein contents of extracts varied between 0.25 and 1.8 mg/ml. Extracts were incubated routinely at 30 °C and pH 7.5 in a reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 90 mm Tris-HCl buffer and 2.5 mm MgCl2, together with (as appropriate) 0.5 mm ferulic acid, 0.2 mm CoASH (lithium salt), and 2.5 mm ATP. This complete reaction mixture constituted an assay for ferulate:SCoA ligase, where the initial increase in absorbance at 345 nm was monitored against a blank reaction mixture from which CoASH was omitted. A value for ε345 of 1.9 × 104m−1cm−1 was used (13Zenk M.H. Ulbrich B. Brusse J. Stöckigt J. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 101: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Incubations with HMPHP SCoA (see below for preparation) were performed similarly, but with the omission of ferulic acid, CoASH, and ATP. Vanillin:NAD+ oxidoreductase was assayed at 30 °C and pH 7.0 by monitoring the initial decrease in absorbance at 340 nm against a blank reaction mixture from which NAD+ had been omitted. Because of the similarity in the extinction coefficients of vanillin and NADH, regeneration of NADH to NAD+ was achieved by providing lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate in the reaction mixture. Reaction mixtures contained, in a 1-ml volume, 75 mm KPi buffer, pH 7.0, 0.125 mm vanillin, 1.2 mm sodium pyruvate, 1.1 unit of lactate dehydrogenase (rabbit muscle; Boehringer, Lewes, Sussex, UK), and 0.5 mm NAD+. Protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using commercially prepared reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK). Metabolites, including the components of cell-free reaction mixtures, were routinely analyzed and quantitated by HPLC using a Lichrosorb RP-18 column (20 cm × 4.6 mm; Capital HPLC, Broxburn, West Lothian, UK) with a multiphasic gradient. Solvent A was 20 mm NaOAc, adjusted to pH 6, and solvent B was MeOH. The flow rate was 1.2 ml/min. The proportion of solvent B rose linearly from 0% at 0 min to 10% at 15 min and then to 50% at 40 min and 75% at 45 min, finally decreasing to 0% at 50 min. Detection was with a Spectra Focus detector (ThermoSeparation Products, Stone, Staffordshire, UK) which permitted UV analysis of each eluting component. Typical approximate retention times were: CoASH, 3 min; vanillic acid, 7 min; ferulic acid, 19 min; acetyl-SCoA, 22 min; HMPHP SCoA, 29 min; vanilloyl-SCoA, 31 min; vanillin, 31.5 min; feruloyl-SCoA, 34 min. Quantitation was based on absorbance measurements at 260 nm, using reference compounds as standards; aromatic CoASH thioesters (both as substrates and products) were also quantitated independently by alkaline hydrolysis to the free acids, which were then measured by HPLC. Mass spectra (+-ve and −-ve ion) were recorded on a 9/50 mass spectrometer (Kratos Instruments, Manchester, UK) using xenon fast atom bombardment at a potential of 6–8 kV with glycerol as matrix. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of cell-free reaction mixtures was performed on a Platform I instrument (Micromass, Manchester, UK) using positive electrospray ionization and liquid chromatography conditions adapted from the HPLC conditions described above; data were processed using Micromass MassLynx software. A suspension of vanillate-grown cells (1 ml; 4 × 109 cells/ml in 0.1 m KPi) was incubated with 0.08 ml of ethyl methane sulfonate in a total of 3 ml of 0.1 mKH2PO4 at 37 °C for 45 min. The cells were then precipitated by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed, resuspended, and inoculated into 50 ml of LB-Mod medium. After overnight incubation at 25 °C, the mutagenized cells were enriched for mutants in ferulate utilization by treatment with carbenicillin in minimal medium in the presence of ferulic acid. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and then washed and resuspended in 20 ml of minimal medium. A sample (1 ml) was inoculated into minimal medium (15 ml) and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h; then ferulic acid (10 mm final concentration) and carbenicillin (2 mg/ml final concentration) were added. (A control flask was prepared containing ferulic acid, but not carbenicillin.) The flask was incubated overnight at 25 °C for 16 h, monitoring A580 to confirm the effectiveness of the antibiotic. Penicillinase (10 units) was then added to destroy the carbenicillin, incubating overnight at 25 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed twice, and resuspended in 5 ml of minimal medium; 1 ml of these resuspended cells was then inoculated into 50 ml of medium containing 10 mm vanillic acid and incubated at 25 °C for about 24 h. These enriched cells were finally screened by replica plating for mutants unable to use ferulic acid. The enriched stock was diluted, plated onto LB-Mod medium, incubated at 25 °C for 2 days, and then replica plated onto minimal medium containing 10 mm vanillic acid or 10 mm ferulic acid. The plates were incubated at 25 °C for 2–3 days and screened for colonies able to grow on vanillate but unable to grow on ferulate. A genomic library was prepared in the broad host range cosmid cloning vector, pLAFR3 (15Staskawicz B. Dahlbeck D. Keen N. Napoli C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from strain AN103 and partially digested with Sau3AI at 37 °C for 7–10 min. The DNA was then size fractionated on a NaCl gradient (1.25–5 m). The fraction containing DNA of 20–40 kb was selected and 0.5 μg ligated into the dephosphorylatedBamHI site of pLAFR3. Half of the ligation mix was packaged into bacteriophage λ particles using a Gigapack II XL kit (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). The packaged cosmids were transfected intoE. coli strain 803 (16Wood W.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 118-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Approximately 10,000 primary transfectants were obtained. The lawn of cells obtained was washed from the selection plates, and glycerol-containing stocks were prepared for storage at −70 °C. The genomic library in cosmid pLAFR3 was introduced into mutant strains by conjugation using the helper plasmid, pRK2013 (17Figurski D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). Mutant strains were inoculated into minimal medium containing 10 mm vanillic acid and incubated at 25 °C for 2 days. The E. coli strain carrying the helper plasmid (E. coli 803pRK2013) was inoculated into LB-Mod medium (10 ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. A sample of the AN103 genomic library was similarly inoculated and incubated. Equal populations of the three organisms were then combined. The mixture of cells was centrifuged, resuspended in a minimal volume of the supernatant solution, and spread over a sterile gridded cellulose nitrate membrane filter (47-mm diameter, Whatman, Maidstone, Kent, UK) on a moist LB-Mod agar plate. The suspension was allowed to air dry onto the filter for a few minutes and then incubated overnight at 25 °C. The bacteria were washed from the filter, and aliquots (0.1 ml) were applied to selection plates of minimal medium with 10 mm vanillic acid and 5 μg/ml of tetracycline. These were incubated at 25 °C for 2 days and the colonies obtained (>1,000/plate) were replica plated to similar plates containing ferulic acid in place of vanillic acid. Colonies (two to three/plate) able to grow on these plates containing ferulic acid were selected and inoculated into fresh minimal medium containing 5 μg/ml tetracycline. SDS-PAGE, with Coomassie staining, was carried out essentially as described by Schägger and von Jagow (18Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar), using an Atto AE6450 gel electrophoresis apparatus (supplied by Genetic Research Instrumentation, Dunmow, Essex, UK). Electroelution of protein bands from fixed, stained gels was performed using a Bio-Rad model 422 electroeluter according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted protein was then deposited by centrifugation onto a Pro-Spin membrane (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) used as directed by the manufacturer. Protein NH2-terminal sequencing was undertaken under contract by Alta Bioscience, Department of Biochemistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. Cosmid DNA was isolated using Qiagen minicolumns (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRI and PstI. Fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blotted to a Hybond-N filter (Amersham International, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, UK) as described elsewhere (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probe DNA was linearized, denatured, and labeled with digoxygenin as described by the kit manufacturer (Boehringer). Oligonucleotide primers were prepared using an ABI 394 Synthesizer (Perkin-Elmer, Warrington, UK). For PCR, Perkin-Elmer UltmaTM DNA polymerase was used with a “hot start” according to the manufacturer's directions; a Hybaid OmnigeneTM instrument (Teddington, Middlesex, UK) was used, with the following thermal cycling conditions: for amplification using the degenerate primers based on the NH2-terminal sequence of the 31-kDa protein (see Fig. 5), there was one cycle of a 2-min denaturation at 95 °C followed by 25 cycles, each consisting of a 2-min denaturation at 95 °C, 2-min annealing at 50 °C, and 2-min extension at 72 °C, and finally, one cycle of a 7-min extension at 72 °C. For the amplification of open reading frame (ORF) A, there was one cycle of a 2-min denaturation at 96 °C followed by five cycles, each consisting of a 2-min denaturation at 96 °C, 2-min annealing at 47 °C, and 2-min extension at 72 °C, then 20 cycles, each consisting of a 2-min denaturation at 96 °C, 2-min annealing at 60 °C, and 2-min extension at 72 °C, and finally, one cycle of a 5-min extension at 72 °C. The following primers were used for the amplification of ORF A before cloning in the E. coli expression vector, pSP72 (Promega): NH2-terminal, 5′-TATATAGAATTCAAAACCCAGAACAAGA-3′, incorporating a syntheticEcoRI site; COOH-terminal, 5′-ATATATGGATCCTTCAGCGTTTATACG-3′, incorporating a syntheticBamHI site. For amplification of ORF A before cloning in the vector pRK415 (20Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar), the NH2-terminal primer used was 5′-TATATAAGCTTGGCCGGTGATTGC-3′, incorporating a syntheticHindIII site; this was homologous to a sequence CGACCTTGGCCGGTGATTGCTACGGCCAATATCGCTCGGC running from −1 to −40 bp upstream of the start of the sequence shown in Fig. 5. Cosmid restriction fragments for sequencing were subcloned into the E. coli vector pUC19 (Pharmacia), using strain XLI (Blue) (Stratagene). Automated fluorescent sequencing by the Sanger dideoxy termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) was carried out by means of an Applied Biosystems DNA Sequencer (model 373; Perkin-Elmer) together with the manufacturer's Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit, used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A primer walking strategy was employed. Homologies of nucleotide sequences and their translation products with sequences available in the data libraries were determined using the Wisconsin Package, Version 8, September 1994, Genetics Computer Group, Madison WI and EGCG Package, Peter Rice, The Sanger Center, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK. The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper have been submitted to the EMBL, GenBankTM, and DDBJ nucleotide sequence data bases under accession number Y13067. P. fluorescens biovar V, strain AN103, has been deposited with the National Collection of Industrial and Marine Bacteria, Aberdeen, UK under accession no. NCIMB 40783 as required under the Budapest Treaty governing deposits of organisms in connection with patent applications (8Narbad, A., Rhodes, M. J. C., Gasson, M. J., and Walton, N. J. (March 22, 1996) U. K. Patent GB 9606187.4.Google Scholar, 22Narbad, A., Rhodes, M. J. C., Gasson, M. J., and Walton, N. J. (March 21, 1997) Patent PCT/GB97/00809.Google Scholar). It was shown previously1 that the metabolism of ferulate by extracts of cells of strain AN103 grown in the presence of ferulate required CoASH, ATP, and Mg2+ions. The reaction products were feruloyl-SCoA and equimolar quantities of vanillin and acetyl-SCoA (Fig.2 A). Because there was no requirement for NAD+ and because vanilloyl-SCoA (0.5 mm) was found not to be converted to vanillin by these extracts even in the presence of NADH (0.5 mm), the cleavage reaction appeared to proceed without β-oxidation (see Fig.1). Extracts also converted the hydrated derivative of feruloyl-SCoA, HMPHP SCoA. This too was converted to vanillin and acetyl-SCoA in equimolar quantities without a requirement for NAD+ (Fig.2 B); and in addition it was dehydrated by the extract to feruloyl-SCoA, demonstrating the reverse of the enoyl-SCoA hydratase reaction (see Fig. 1). (The feruloyl-SCoA so formed was assumed to be the trans-isomer, but cis- and trans-isomers were not distinguished by the HPLC analysis used.) The reaction was relatively rapid, and greater than 90% of the substrate was converted to products. Vanillin formation was therefore independent of added NAD+; however, as indicated previously,1 when NAD+was provided in the reaction mixture, much of the vanillin was oxidized to vanillate by the activity of vanillin:NAD+oxidoreductase present in the extracts. A classical mutation and complementation strategy was used to isolate the gene(s) responsible for ferulate cleavage. Mutants of P. fluorescens AN103 which were unable to utilize ferulate as sole carbon source were isolated, and their defect was then complemented by the introduction of cosmid clones from a genomic library of the same strain. Chemical mutagenesis of P. fluorescens AN103 using ethyl methane sulfonate was followed with enrichment and screening for mutants unable to grow on ferulate. These mutants all retained the ability to grow on vanillate and fell into two biochemical classes distinguished by the activities of ferulate:CoASH ligase and vanillin:NAD+ oxidoreductase. As shown in TableI, class I mutants (typified by van 1) had severely reduced activities of both ferulate:CoASH ligase and vanillin:NAD+ oxidoreductase, whereas class II mutants (typified by van 10) had wild-type levels of both enzymes. Despite the presence of these enzyme activities, cell-free extracts of the class II mutants were impaired in the ability to form vanillate from ferulate in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, CoASH, and NAD+. This suggested that the class II mutants were defective in a structural gene for vanillin formation from feruloyl-SCoA. The absence of two distinct enzyme activities in the class I mutants suggested that they may be defective in a common gene control process.Table IMetabolism of ferulate in cell-free extracts of P. fluorescens biovar V, strain AN103, and of mutant strains van 1 and van 10StrainEnzyme activityVanillate formedFerulate:CoASH ligaseVanillin:NAD+ oxidoreductasenanokatals/mg proteinnmol/mg proteinAN1031.71.2807van 10∼0.050van 102.01.459 Open table in a new tab A class II mutant was used for complementation experiments designed to isolate a wild-type copy of the mutant gene. A gene library of P. fluorescens AN103 DNA was constructed using the broad host range cosmid cloning vector pLAFR3 in E. coli. Cosmid clones were introduced from the E. coli library into a class II mutant derivative of P. fluorescens AN103 by triparental mating using an E. coli strain carrying the helper plasmid pRK2013. Two cosmids, pFI793 and pFI794, were identified as complementing the class II mutants. The protein profiles of P. fluorescens AN103 following growth on ferulate and vanillate were compared using SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. As shown in Fig.3, the ferulate-grown cells produced a strongly enhanced or additional band corresponding to a polypeptide of 31 kDa. It was likely that this polypeptide was an enzyme involved in the conversion of ferulate to vanillin. Accordingly, the 31-kDa band was excised from the fixed and stained polyacrylamide gel, electroeluted, and subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing. The following sequence was determined: Ser-Thr-Tyr-Glu-Gly-Arg-Trp-Lys-Thr-ValLys-Val-Glu-Ile-Gln-Asp-Gly-Ile-Ala-Phe. The NH2-terminal sequence of the ferulate-induced 31-kDa polypeptide was used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers (Fig. 4) which were shown to PCR amplify a 60-bp sequence of DNA from the equivalentP. fluorescens AN103 gene. The amplified fragment was used as a probe to locate this gene on EcoRI/PstI digests of the two cosmids pFI793 and pFI794. The fragments identified were 6 kb and 4.3 kb, respectively, and the latter smaller fragment was targeted for subcloning and sequence determination. The sequence of part of the 4.3-kb fragment of cosmid pFI794 is shown in Fig.5. An open reading frame ORF A (831 bp), corresponding to the ferulate-induced polypeptide and encoding the NH2 terminus determined previously, commenced at position 126 and was terminated by a stop codon at position 954; it encoded a polypeptide of 276 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 31.010 kDa, in good agreement with the SDS-PAGE data (see Fig. 3). A native ribosome binding site (GAGA) could be identified at −9 bp and inverted repeats at −37 bp, −64 bp, and −83 bp. A second open reading frame (ORF B) was found to begin at position 1058 and was terminated by a stop codon beginning at position 2504 (data not shown). This open reading frame of 1,449 bp encoded a derived polypeptide sequence of 482 amino acids and was preceded by a native ribosome binding site (GAGG) at −8 bp. To determine the function of ORF A and to assay its gene product, ORF A was amplified by PCR, cloned into an E. coli expression vector, and then transformed into E. coli. From the sequence of ORF A, PCR primers (see “Experimental Procedures”) were designed to amplify the gene such that it was flanked by restriction endonuclease sites EcoRI and BamHI. The amplified gene retained its native ribosome binding site, being initiated at base −29 and ending 6 bp downstream of the stop codon. The amplified fragment was cloned into the equivalent sites of the E. coli expression vector pSP72 (under the control of the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter) to produce pFI1039, which was transformed into E. coliJM109(DE3) (Promega). Cells of the E. coli strain containing the vector pSP72 alone, designated JP1, and of the strain containing pFI1039, designated JP2, were each grown in the presence and absence of the inducer, isoprop"
https://openalex.org/W2073100042,"In the female mosquito, Aedes aegypti, neurohormones are released from the brain in response to a blood meal and stimulate the ovaries to secrete ecdysteroid hormones, which modulate yolk protein synthesis in the fat body. Neuropeptides with this bioactivity were isolated from head extracts, and partial sequences from these peptides when aligned gave a 31-residue sequence at the amino terminus. Oligonucleotide primers for this sequence were used to amplify with the polymerase chain reaction a genomic DNA product that hybridized to a clone from a head cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a 149-residue preprohormone that is processed into an 86-residue peptide, as indicated by the mass value obtained from the native peptide, with the expected amino-terminal sequence. After modification, the cDNA for the putative neurohormone was expressed in a bacterial system, and the purified peptide had high specific activity in bioassays, thus confirming that it is a steroidogenic gonadotropin, the first to be identified for invertebrates.

Among vertebrates, the gonadotropic neurohormones, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, regulate steroidogenesis during reproductive cycles; for invertebrates, the only characterized steroidogenic neurohormones are the prothoracicotropic hormones, which initiate molting in insect larvae (1Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar). The first insect gonadotropin was discovered by Lea (2Lea A.O. J. Insect Physiol. 1967; 13: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Lea A.O. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1972; 3: 602-608Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar), who described a neurohormone controlling reproduction in mosquitoes. For the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae), each reproductive cycle in a female begins with the ingestion of a blood meal and ends with egg deposition. The blood meal, in turn, stimulates release of gonadotropic neurohormones from medial neurosecretory cells in the brain for up to 12 h post ingestion (2Lea A.O. J.

These neurohormones stimulate the ovaries to secrete ecdysteroids and thus are referred to as “ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormones” (OEHs) 1The abbreviations used are: OEH, ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormone; HFBA, heptafluorobutyric acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tricine, N-[2- hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.1The abbreviations used are: OEH, ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormone; HFBA, heptafluorobutyric acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tricine, N-[2- hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.

Entomol. 1995; 92: 113-122Google Scholar), only their peptide nature and apparent heterogeneity (3,500–24,000-Da range) are known. This report describes the purification of OEH I from an extract of six million heads and its structural characterization by a combination of biochemical and molecular techniques. To verify the biological activity of the putative neurohormone, a recombinant OEH I was expressed and purified for testing in vivo and in vitro, and with an OEH I antiserum, the source of the neurohormone was identified.RESULTSFrom the extraction of six million mosquito heads, three bioactive peptides were separated in the first few chromatographic steps. Only one of the peptides was isolated in sufficient quantity with a final step of microcapillary HPLC (Fig.1 A) to allow structural characterization. A portion of the peptide sample was subjected to mass spectrometry. Two predominant peaks, Mr-8803 and 8821 (the oxidation of a Met may account for the higher value), were evident along with a smaller peak, Mr-8595 (Fig.1 B). An attempt to sequence a portion of the peptide from the amino-terminus failed, so other portions were digested with trypsin or endoproteinase Asp-N. Sequences from a tryptic fragment (LYSGPAVQNTGE-VHGAELNP) and from Asp-N digest fragments (GVLYVLPAVQ and EIR- -LY-GPAVQN-G) were obtained. These sequences when aligned with ones obtained from the amino terminus (PTNVLEIRWKLYSGPAVQNTGE-V) and a tryptic fragment (- - -LPAVQNT-E-V- - - -LN) of bioactive peptides isolated from other head extracts gave a common sequence of 31 residues (PTNVLEIRG/WK/VLYS/VG/LPAVQNTGE-VHGAELNP) with alternative residues at four positions.To complete the OEH sequence, oligonucleotides for the amino and carboxyl termini of the 31-residue sequence were used as primers to amplify by PCR a genomic DNA product. The translated sequence of the product (PTNVLEMRCKLYSGPAVQNTGECVHGAELN) resolved residue ambiguities, especially where a Cys was encoded, and differed from that of the peptide sequence at residues seven, Met for Ile, and nine, Cys for Gly/Trp. The PCR product then was used to probe a head cDNA library, and a clone was identified and sequenced. The cDNA clone is 973 nucleotides long and has an open reading frame encoding a 149-residue peptide that begins with a putative signal peptide followed by the PCR product sequence (Fig. 2). Residue 30 of the encoded peptide matches the corresponding residue seven, Ile, in the composite amino-terminal sequence of the bioactive peptide sequence and not the Met of the PCR product. Also, the sequence from residue 64 to 86 of the encoded peptide matches that of a tryptic fragment obtained from a bioactive peptide (FVGDK-GESTAGIIMSGK-ASGLM, see “Purification of Native OEHs,” under “Experimental Procedures”). A search of protein data bases revealed that the encoded peptide sequence from residue 23 to 109 had the highest sequence similarity (29%) to that of a locust neurohormone, neuroparsin A (Fig. 3) (17Girardie J. Fournier B. Mol. Comp. Physiol. 1993; 12: 63-67Google Scholar). No other protein sequences were significantly similar, even when searches were limited to the sequence, KGVGDKCG (residue 62–68), that is seemingly conserved between OEH I and neuroparsin A.A bacterial system was chosen for expression of the OEH I cDNA to determine whether the encoded peptide from residue 24–108 was bioactive. A peptide of ∼9 kDa was the predominant form in a Western blot of solubilized protein from BL21/OEH I cells (Fig.4); a dimer and trimer of the peptide also were evident. No immunoreactive peptides were evident in the protein from BL21/pET cells. Solubilized BL21/OEH I protein stimulated yolk deposition in all females injected over a range of 0.06 to 1.8 μg/female, whereas BL21/pET protein showed no bioactivity over the same range. Ovary ecdysteroidogenesis was stimulated approximately three fold with 1.0 μg of the BL21/OEH I protein (306 ± 47 pg* (X ± S.E.) ecdysteroids/50 μl of incubation media) above that with the same amount of BL21/pET protein (83 ± 30 pg). Greater amounts of the BL21/OEH I protein stimulated a similar level of ecdysteroidogenesis (4.0 μg of protein, 394 ± 25 pg* ecdysteroids; 2.0 μg, 339 ± 22 pg*) above that of BL21/pET protein (4.0 μg, 132 ± 30 pg; 2.0 μg, 43 ± 10 pg).Figure 4Tris-Tricine denaturing gel electrophoresis (A, 5.6 μg/protein/lane) and Western blot (B, 0.7 μg/protein/lane) of solubilized proteins from BL21/OEH 3.1 and BL21/pET cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The solubilized BL21/OEH I protein was purified further by semipreparative HPLC to determine its specific activity in the bioassays. In addition, mass spectrometry of a portion of the purified BL21/OEH I peptide revealed a predominant peak of Mr-8691. The amount of purified peptide was calculated from the results of the amino acid analysis. This analysis also indicated that the amino acid composition of the expressed peptide was similar to that of OEH I (15 of the 16 amino acids quantified were ± 1.0 mol % of the value known for OEH I, excluding Cys residues). For the in vivo bioassay, the minimum amount of peptide found to stimulate yolk deposition in more than half of the injected females was 0.15 ng (0.017 pmol)/female (11/13 females injected); 0.58 and 0.29 ng/female had the same effect. Bioactivity was evident at 0.07 ng/female (4/13 females injected) and not at lower amounts. Ovary ecdysteroidogenesis in vitro was stimulated 2-fold (87 ± 13 pg* ecdysteroids/50 μl of incubation medium) with 57 ng (6.6 pmol) of the purified peptide above that of ovaries incubated in medium alone (39 ± 10 pg). With greater quantities of peptide, ecdysteroid production increased 3-fold (114 ng of peptide, 120 ± 6 pg* of ecdysteroids; 228 ng, 115 ± 10 pg*) and decreased with a smaller quantity (29 ng, 58 ± 9 pg).To identify the source of OEH I in the mosquito head, the antiserum specific for the genomic DNA PCR product was used for immunocytochemistry. Immunoreactivity was observed in two or three pairs of medial neurosecretory cells in the female brain (Fig.5) and in their axons extending to the corpus cardiacum, a neurohemal organ associated with the aorta. Preabsorption of the antiserum with the synthetic peptide blocked immunoreactivity.Figure 5Immunocytochemistry with OEH I antiserum demonstrating that two to three pairs of medial neurosecretory cells (arrowheads) in the perikarya of the brain of a female mosquito contain OEH I (× 1770; NP, neuropil;CE, compound eye).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONNeuropeptides with gonadotropic and ecdysteroidogenic bioactivity in female mosquitoes were isolated from different extracts of several million heads and subjected to sequencing either before or after enzyme digests. Of those partial sequences, all but one could be aligned within a 31-residue sequence at the amino-terminal region. With this sequence information and molecular techniques, the preprohormone sequence for the first OEH (designated as OEH I) identified in mosquitoes was determined from a cDNA sequence (Fig. 2). Partial peptide sequences for the amino-terminal region and for a tryptic fragment of bioactive peptides are found within the prohormone sequence. In addition, the original studies of Lea (2Lea A.O. J. Insect Physiol. 1967; 13: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Lea A.O. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1972; 3: 602-608Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) are supported by the immunocytochemical localization of OEH I in the medial neurosecretory cells of female mosquitoes.Structural and molecular characterization, taken together, suggest a putative sequence for the native OEH I. The value obtained by mass spectrometry of a bioactive peptide, Mr-8803, is the same as that predicted for an 86 residue peptide extending from a pGlu at residue 23, a converted Gln, to the carboxyl terminus, an Arg at residue 108 (an endoproteinase site), assuming four internal disulfide bonds (Fig. 2). Based on sequencing results from native peptides, the amino terminus may either be the Pro at residue 24 or the Gln at residue 23. The sequence beginning with the Pro at residue 24 and extending to residue 108 would have an estimated mass of 8692, which is less than the mass spectrometry value, thus indicating that pGlu is the more likely amino terminus. Unsuccessful attempts to sequence the amino terminus of the peptide subjected to mass spectrometry and other peptides previously isolated (4Matsumoto S. Brown M.R. Suzuki A. Lea A.O. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 651-656Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) adds further support for a pGlu, which in this position prevents Edman sequencing. With 12 Cys residues in the peptide sequence, up to six internal disulfide bonds can be formed; only with additional studies will the specific Cys residues forming the bonds be identified. The above sequence has a predicted pI of 7.8, consistent with its basic nature observed during chromatography, and there are no glycosylation sites. The fate and role of the putative peptide spanning residues 109–149 that is part of the OEH I prohormone are unknown.Bacterial expression of the OEH I cDNA sequence from residues 24 to 108, without the putative pGlu at the amino terminus, yielded a peptide that was recognized by the OEH I antiserum in a Western blot. The purified peptide had high specific activity in both the in vivo and in vitro bioassays, thus confirming that OEH I is an ecdysteroidogenic gonadotropin. Yolk deposition in a blood-fed decapitated female was stimulated by as little as 11 nmexpressed OEH I (0.017 pmol/female with ∼1.0 μl of hemolymph and 0.5 μl of carrier saline solution). A 10 times greater concentration of the expressed peptide (110 nm peptide; 6.6 pmol/60 μl of medium) was needed to stimulate ecdysteroidogenesis by isolated ovaries. The high specific bioactivity of the expressed peptide suggests that the pGlu amino terminus is not an absolute requirement for bioactivity and that the peptide is folded in the same way as the native peptide. The mass value of 8692 obtained for the expressed peptide is the same as that estimated for this sequence with four disulfide bonds.The amino acid sequence of OEH I has limited similarity with that of neuroparsin A (Fig. 3), a neurohormone in locusts; both peptides have twelve Cys residues, eight of which are positioned similarly. Neuroparsin A (Mr-8754) was isolated from the corpora cardiaca of adult Locusta migratoria, based on its antidiuretic activity, and sequenced (17Girardie J. Fournier B. Mol. Comp. Physiol. 1993; 12: 63-67Google Scholar). It is synthesized in the medial neurosecretory cells of the brain and stored in the corpora cardiaca, where it is processed into several truncated forms at the amino terminus, including neuroparsin B, with 78 residues (Mr-8185). Additionally, a cDNA of 683 base pairs encoding neuroparsin A was cloned from an adult brain cDNA library. Neuroparsins are best characterized for their stimulation of fluid uptake in the rectum of locusts through the inositol phosphate cascade (18Fournier B. Guerineau N. Mollard P. Girardie J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is not known whether neuroparsins are steroidogenic in locusts.Heterogeneity of OEHs was observed in this purification effort and in other reports (4Matsumoto S. Brown M.R. Suzuki A. Lea A.O. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 651-656Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Wheelock G.D. Sieber K.P. Hagedorn H.H. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 542: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8Masler E.P. Kelly T.J. Eur. J. Entomol. 1995; 92: 113-122Google Scholar). The different bioactive peptides may be due to the processing of a larger peptide into truncated forms during secretion, as with neuroparsin A, to peptide degradation during extraction and purification, to multiple genes encoding related peptides, or to the existence of structurally unrelated but functionally similar neuropeptides. Preliminary results from Southern analysis indicates the existence of a single copy of the OEH I gene with at least four alleles represented in the population of mosquitoes in our laboratory. These polymorphisms may account for the sequence differences between the PCR product and the OEH I cDNA. An insulin-like neuropeptide also may have a role in ovary ecdysteroidogenesis in mosquitoes, as suggested by characterization of an insulin receptor-like protein in mosquito ovaries and stimulation of this process by vertebrate insulin (15Graf R. Neuenschwander S. Brown M.R. Ackermann U. Insect Mol. Biol. 1997; 6: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Neuropeptides with very different molecular weights are known to stimulate ecdysteroidogenesis by the prothoracic glands of several insect species (19Muehleisen D.P. Katahira E.J. Gray R.S. Bollenbacher W.E. Experientia. 1994; 50: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Hua Y.-J. Jiang R.-J. Koolman J. Arch. Insect Biochem.

The ovary maturating parsin (Mr 6927) of locusts (22Girardie J. Richard O. Girardie A. J. Insect Physiol. 1996; 42: 107-113Crossref Google Scholar, 23Girardie J. Girardie A. J. Insect Physiol. 1996; 42: 215-221Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) is the only other structurally characterized gonadotropin known for adult insects. It is secreted from neurosecretory cells and stimulates ovarian development and vitellogenesis over several days; a direct effect on ovarian ecdysteroidogenesis has not been reported.With the recombinant OEH I, direct effects of this neurohormone on vitellogenesis in the female mosquito can be studied, since it has been shown that 20-hydroxyecdysone indirectly stimulates yolk protein synthesis by the fat body (24Deitsch K.W. Chen J.-S. Raikhel A.S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and that “head factors” affect yolk protein uptake by oocytes (25Koller C.N. Raikhel A.S. J. Insect Physiol. 1991; 37: 703-711Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, the structural characterization of OEH I provides clues for the identification of related peptides that may be evolutionarily conserved for regulation of gonad steroidogenesis in other insects and invertebrates. Among vertebrates, the gonadotropic neurohormones, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, regulate steroidogenesis during reproductive cycles; for invertebrates, the only characterized steroidogenic neurohormones are the prothoracicotropic hormones, which initiate molting in insect larvae (1Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar). The first insect gonadotropin was discovered by Lea (2Lea A.O. J. Insect Physiol. 1967; 13: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Lea A.O. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1972; 3: 602-608Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar), who described a neurohormone controlling reproduction in mosquitoes. For the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae), each reproductive cycle in a female begins with the ingestion of a blood meal and ends with egg deposition. The blood meal, in turn, stimulates release of gonadotropic neurohormones from medial neurosecretory cells in the brain for up to 12 h post ingestion (2Lea A.O. J. Insect Physiol. 1967; 13: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Lea A.O. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1972; 3: 602-608Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These neurohormones stimulate the ovaries to secrete ecdysteroids and thus are referred to as “ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormones” (OEHs) 1The abbreviations used are: OEH, ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormone; HFBA, heptafluorobutyric acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tricine, N-[2- hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.1The abbreviations used are: OEH, ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormone; HFBA, heptafluorobutyric acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tricine, N-[2- hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. (4Matsumoto S. Brown M.R. Suzuki A. Lea A.O. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 651-656Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The ecdysteroids modulate fat body secretion of yolk proteins (5Klowden M.J. Arch.

Vector Res. 1992; 9: 1-39Crossref Google Scholar), which are stored selectively in the oocyte for embryonic development. Despite many attempts to purify gonadotropins from mosquitoes (4Matsumoto S. Brown M.R. Suzuki A. Lea A.O. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 651-656Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Wheelock G.D. Sieber K.P. Hagedorn H.H. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 542: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar,8Masler E.P. Kelly T.J. Eur. J. Entomol. 1995; 92: 113-122Google Scholar), only their peptide nature and apparent heterogeneity (3,500–24,000-Da range) are known. This report describes the purification of OEH I from an extract of six million heads and its structural characterization by a combination of biochemical and molecular techniques. To verify the biological activity of the putative neurohormone, a recombinant OEH I was expressed and purified for testing in vivo and in vitro, and with an OEH I antiserum, the source of the neurohormone was identified. RESULTSFrom the extraction of six million mosquito heads, three bioactive peptides were separated in the first few chromatographic steps. Only one of the peptides was isolated in sufficient quantity with a final step of microcapillary HPLC (Fig.1 A) to allow structural characterization. A portion of the peptide sample was subjected to mass spectrometry. Two predominant peaks, Mr-8803 and 8821 (the oxidation of a Met may account for the higher value), were evident along with a smaller peak, Mr-8595 (Fig.1 B). An attempt to sequence a portion of the peptide from the amino-terminus failed, so other portions were digested with trypsin or endoproteinase Asp-N. Sequences from a tryptic fragment (LYSGPAVQNTGE-VHGAELNP) and from Asp-N digest fragments (GVLYVLPAVQ and EIR- -LY-GPAVQN-G) were obtained. These sequences when aligned with ones obtained from the amino terminus (PTNVLEIRWKLYSGPAVQNTGE-V) and a tryptic fragment (- - -LPAVQNT-E-V- - - -LN) of bioactive peptides isolated from other head extracts gave a common sequence of 31 residues (PTNVLEIRG/WK/VLYS/VG/LPAVQNTGE-VHGAELNP) with alternative residues at four positions.To complete the OEH sequence, oligonucleotides for the amino and carboxyl termini of the 31-residue sequence were used as primers to amplify by PCR a genomic DNA product. The translated sequence of the product (PTNVLEMRCKLYSGPAVQNTGECVHGAELN) resolved residue ambiguities, especially where a Cys was encoded, and differed from that of the peptide sequence at residues seven, Met for Ile, and nine, Cys for Gly/Trp. The PCR product then was used to probe a head cDNA library, and a clone was identified and sequenced. The cDNA clone is 973 nucleotides long and has an open reading frame encoding a 149-residue peptide that begins with a putative signal peptide followed by the PCR product sequence (Fig. 2). Residue 30 of the encoded peptide matches the corresponding residue seven, Ile, in the composite amino-terminal sequence of the bioactive peptide sequence and not the Met of the PCR product. Also, the sequence from residue 64 to 86 of the encoded peptide matches that of a tryptic fragment obtained from a bioactive peptide (FVGDK-GESTAGIIMSGK-ASGLM, see “Purification of Native OEHs,” under “Experimental Procedures”). A search of protein data bases revealed that the encoded peptide sequence from residue 23 to 109 had the highest sequence similarity (29%) to that of a locust neurohormone, neuroparsin A (Fig. 3) (17Girardie J. Fournier B. Mol. Comp. Physiol. 1993; 12: 63-67Google Scholar). No other protein sequences were significantly similar, even when searches were limited to the sequence, KGVGDKCG (residue 62–68), that is seemingly conserved between OEH I and neuroparsin A.A bacterial system was chosen for expression of the OEH I cDNA to determine whether the encoded peptide from residue 24–108 was bioactive. A peptide of ∼9 kDa was the predominant form in a Western blot of solubilized protein from BL21/OEH I cells (Fig.4); a dimer and trimer of the peptide also were evident. No immunoreactive peptides were evident in the protein from BL21/pET cells. Solubilized BL21/OEH I protein stimulated yolk deposition in all females injected over a range of 0.06 to 1.8 μg/female, whereas BL21/pET protein showed no bioactivity over the same range. Ovary ecdysteroidogenesis was stimulated approximately three fold with 1.0 μg of the BL21/OEH I protein (306 ± 47 pg* (X ± S.E.) ecdysteroids/50 μl of incubation media) above that with the same amount of BL21/pET protein (83 ± 30 pg). Greater amounts of the BL21/OEH I protein stimulated a similar level of ecdysteroidogenesis (4.0 μg of protein, 394 ± 25 pg* ecdysteroids; 2.0 μg, 339 ± 22 pg*) above that of BL21/pET protein (4.0 μg, 132 ± 30 pg; 2.0 μg, 43 ± 10 pg).The solubilized BL21/OEH I protein was purified further by semipreparative HPLC to determine its specific activity in the bioassays. In addition, mass spectrometry of a portion of the purified BL21/OEH I peptide revealed a predominant peak of Mr-8691. The amount of purified peptide was calculated from the results of the amino acid analysis. This analysis also indicated that the amino acid composition of the expressed peptide was similar to that of OEH I (15 of the 16 amino acids quantified were ± 1.0 mol % of the value known for OEH I, excluding Cys residues). For the in vivo bioassay, the minimum amount of peptide found to stimulate yolk deposition in more than half of the injected females was 0.15 ng (0.017 pmol)/female (11/13 females injected); 0.58 and 0.29 ng/female had the same effect. Bioactivity was evident at 0.07 ng/female (4/13 females injected) and not at lower amounts. Ovary ecdysteroidogenesis in vitro was stimulated 2-fold (87 ± 13 pg* ecdysteroids/50 μl of incubation medium) with 57 ng (6.6 pmol) of the purified peptide above that of ovaries incubated in medium alone (39 ± 10 pg). With greater quantities of peptide, ecdysteroid production increased 3-fold (114 ng of peptide, 120 ± 6 pg* of ecdysteroids; 228 ng, 115 ± 10 pg*) and decreased with a smaller quantity (29 ng, 58 ± 9 pg).To identify the source of OEH I in the mosquito head, the antiserum specific for the genomic DNA PCR product was used for immunocytochemistry. Immunoreactivity was observed in two or three pairs of medial neurosecretory cells in the female brain (Fig.5) and in their axons extending to the corpus cardiacum, a neurohemal organ associated with the aorta. Preabsorption of the antiserum with the synthetic peptide blocked immunoreactivity.Figure 5Immunocytochemistry with OEH I antiserum demonstrating that two to three pairs of medial neurosecretory cells (arrowheads) in the perikarya of the brain of a female mosquito contain OEH I (× 1770; NP, neuropil;CE, compound eye).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) From the extraction of six million mosquito heads, three bioactive peptides were separated in the first few chromatographic steps.

To complete the OEH sequence, oligonucleotides for the amino and carboxyl termini of the 31-residue sequence were used as primers to amplify by PCR a genomic DNA product.

No other protein sequences were significantly similar, even when searches were limited to the sequence, KGVGDKCG (residue 62–68), that is seemingly conserved between OEH I and neuroparsin A. A bacterial system was chosen for expression of the OEH I cDNA to determine whether the encoded peptide from residue 24–108 was bioactive.

The solubilized BL21/OEH I protein was purified further by semipreparative HPLC to determine its specific activity in the bioassays. In addition, mass spectrometry of a portion of the purified BL21/OEH I peptide revealed a predominant peak of Mr-8691. The amount of purified peptide was calculated from the results of the amino acid analysis. This analysis also indicated that the amino acid composition of the expressed peptide was similar to that of OEH I (15 of the 16 amino acids quantified were ± 1.0 mol % of the value known for OEH I, excluding Cys residues).

Ovary ecdysteroidogenesis in vitro was stimulated 2-fold (87 ± 13 pg* ecdysteroids/50 μl of incubation medium) with 57 ng (6.6 pmol) of the purified peptide above that of ovaries incubated in medium alone (39 ± 10 pg). With greater quantities of peptide, ecdysteroid production increased 3-fold (114 ng of peptide, 120 ± 6 pg* of ecdysteroids; 228 ng, 115 ± 10 pg*) and decreased with a smaller quantity (29 ng, 58 ± 9 pg). To identify the source of OEH I in the mosquito head, the antiserum specific for the genomic DNA PCR product was used for immunocytochemistry. Immunoreactivity was observed in two or three pairs of medial neurosecretory cells in the female brain (Fig.5) and in their axons extending to the corpus cardiacum, a neurohemal organ associated with the aorta. Preabsorption of the antiserum with the synthetic peptide blocked immunoreactivity. DISCUSSIONNeuropeptides with gonadotropic and ecdysteroidogenic bioactivity in female mosquitoes were isolated from different extracts of several million heads and subjected to sequencing either before or after enzyme digests. Of those partial sequences, all but one could be aligned within a 31-residue sequence at the amino-terminal region. With this sequence information and molecular techniques, the preprohormone sequence for the first OEH (designated as OEH I) identified in mosquitoes was determined from a cDNA sequence (Fig. 2). Partial peptide sequences for the amino-terminal region and for a tryptic fragment of bioactive peptides are found within the prohormone sequence. In addition, the original studies of Lea (2Lea A.O. J. Insect Physiol. 1967; 13: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Lea A.O. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1972; 3: 602-608Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) are supported by the immunocytochemical localization of OEH I in the medial neurosecretory cells of female mosquitoes.Structural and molecular characterization, taken together, suggest a putative sequence for the native OEH I. The value obtained by mass spectrometry of a bioactive peptide, Mr-8803, is the same as that predicted for an 86 residue peptide extending from a pGlu at residue 23, a converted Gln, to the carboxyl terminus, an Arg at residue 108 (an endoproteinase site), assuming four internal disulfide bonds (Fig. 2). Based on sequencing results from native peptides, the amino terminus may either be the Pro at residue 24 or the Gln at residue 23. The sequence beginning with the Pro at residue 24 and extending to residue 108 would have an estimated mass of 8692, which is less than the mass spectrometry value, thus indicating that pGlu is the more likely amino terminus. Unsuccessful attempts to sequence the amino terminus of the peptide subjected to mass spectrometry and other peptides previously isolated (4Matsumoto S. Brown M.R. Suzuki A. Lea A.O. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 651-656Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) adds further support for a pGlu, which in this position prevents Edman sequencing. With 12 Cys residues in the peptide sequence, up to six internal disulfide bonds can be formed; only with additional studies will the specific Cys residues forming the bonds be identified. The above sequence has a predicted pI of 7.8, consistent with its basic nature observed during chromatography, and there are no glycosylation sites. The fate and role of the putative peptide spanning residues 109–149 that is part of the OEH I prohormone are unknown.Bacterial expression of the OEH I cDNA sequence from residues 24 to 108, without the putative pGlu at the amino terminus, yielded a peptide that was recognized by the OEH I antiserum in a Western blot. The purified peptide had high specific activity in both the in vivo and in vitro bioassays, thus confirming that OEH I is an ecdysteroidogenic gonadotropin. Yolk deposition in a blood-fed decapitated female was stimulated by as little as 11 nmexpressed OEH I (0.017 pmol/female with ∼1.0 μl of hemolymph and 0.5 μl of carrier saline solution). A 10 times greater concentration of the expressed peptide (110 nm peptide; 6.6 pmol/60 μl of medium) was needed to stimulate ecdysteroidogenesis by isolated ovaries. The high specific bioactivity of the expressed peptide suggests that the pGlu amino terminus is not an absolute requirement for bioactivity and that the peptide is folded in the same way as the native peptide. The mass value of 8692 obtained for the expressed peptide is the same as that estimated for this sequence with four disulfide bonds.The amino acid sequence of OEH I has limited similarity with that of neuroparsin A (Fig. 3), a neurohormone in locusts; both peptides have twelve Cys residues, eight of which are positioned similarly. Neuroparsin A (Mr-8754) was isolated from the corpora cardiaca of adult Locusta migratoria, based on its antidiuretic activity, and sequenced (17Girardie J. Fournier B. Mol. Comp. Physiol. 1993; 12: 63-67Google Scholar). It is synthesized in the medial neurosecretory cells of the brain and stored in the corpora cardiaca, where it is processed into several truncated forms at the amino terminus, including neuroparsin B, with 78 residues (Mr-8185). Additionally, a cDNA of 683 base pairs encoding neuroparsin A was cloned from an adult brain cDNA library. Neuroparsins are best characterized for their stimulation of fluid uptake in the rectum of locusts through the inositol phosphate cascade (18Fournier B. Guerineau N. Mollard P. Girardie J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is not known whether neuroparsins are steroidogenic in locusts.Heterogeneity of OEHs was observed in this purification effort and in other reports (4Matsumoto S. Brown M.R. Suzuki A. Lea A.O. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 651-656Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Wheelock G.D. Sieber K.P. Hagedorn H.H. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 542: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8Masler E.P. Kelly T.J. Eur. J. Entomol. 1995; 92: 113-122Google Scholar). The different bioactive peptides may be due to the processing of a larger peptide into truncated forms during secretion, as with neuroparsin A, to peptide degradation during extraction and purification, to multiple genes encoding related peptides, or to the existence of structurally unrelated but functionally similar neuropeptides. Preliminary results from Southern analysis indicates the existence of a single copy of the OEH I gene with at least four alleles represented in the population of mosquitoes in our laboratory. These polymorphisms may account for the sequence differences between the PCR product and the OEH I cDNA.

A 10 times greater concentration of the expressed peptide (110 nm peptide; 6.6 pmol/60 μl of medium) was needed to stimulate ecdysteroidogenesis by isolated ovaries. The high specific bioactivity of the expressed peptide suggests that the pGlu amino terminus is not an absolute requirement for bioactivity and that the peptide is folded in the same way as the native peptide. The mass value of 8692 obtained for the expressed peptide is the same as that estimated for this sequence with four disulfide bonds. The amino acid sequence of OEH I has limited similarity with that of neuroparsin A (Fig. 3), a neurohormone in locusts; both peptides have twelve Cys residues, eight of which are positioned similarly. Neuroparsin A (Mr-8754) was isolated from the corpora cardiaca of adult Locusta migratoria, based on its antidiuretic activity, and sequenced (17Girardie J. Fournier B. Mol. Comp. Physiol. 1993; 12: 63-67Google Scholar). It is synthesized in the medial neurosecretory cells of the brain and stored in the corpora cardiaca, where it is processed into several truncated forms at the amino terminus, including neuroparsin B, with 78 residues (Mr-8185). Additionally, a cDNA of 683 base pairs encoding neuroparsin A was cloned from an adult brain cDNA library. Neuroparsins are best characterized for their stimulation of fluid uptake in the rectum of locusts through the inositol phosphate cascade (18Fournier B. Guerineau N. Mollard P. Girardie J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is not known whether neuroparsins are steroidogenic in locusts. Heterogeneity of OEHs was observed in this purification effort and in other reports (4Matsumoto S. Brown M.R. Suzuki A. Lea A.O. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 651-656Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Wheelock G.D. Sieber K.P. Hagedorn H.H. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 542: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8Masler E.P. Kelly T.J. Eur. J. Entomol. 1995; 92: 113-122Google Scholar). The different bioactive peptides may be due to the processing of a larger peptide into truncated forms during secretion, as with neuroparsin A, to peptide degradation during extraction and purification, to multiple genes encoding related peptides, or to the existence of structurally unrelated but functionally similar neuropeptides. Preliminary results from Southern analysis indicates the existence of a single copy of the OEH I gene with at least four alleles represented in the population of mosquitoes in our laboratory. These polymorphisms may account for the sequence differences between the PCR product and the OEH I cDNA. An insulin-like neuropeptide also may have a role in ovary ecdysteroidogenesis in mosquitoes, as suggested by characterization of an insulin receptor-like protein in mosquito ovaries and stimulation of this process by vertebrate insulin (15Graf R. Neuenschwander S. Brown M.R. Ackermann U. Insect Mol. Biol. 1997; 6: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Neuropeptides with very different molecular weights are known to stimulate ecdysteroidogenesis by the prothoracic glands of several insect species (19Muehleisen D.P. Katahira E.J. Gray R.S.

The ovary maturating parsin (Mr 6927) of locusts (22Girardie J. Richard O. Girardie A. J. Insect Physiol. 1996; 42: 107-113Crossref Google Scholar, 23Girardie J. Girardie A. J. Insect Physiol. 1996; 42: 215-221Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) is the only other structurally characterized gonadotropin known for adult insects. It is secreted from neurosecretory cells and stimulates ovarian development and vitellogenesis over several days; a direct effect on ovarian ecdysteroidogenesis has not been reported. With the recombinant OEH I, direct effects of this neurohormone on vitellogenesis in the female mosquito can be studied, since it has been shown that 20-hydroxyecdysone indirectly stimulates yolk protein synthesis by the fat body (24Deitsch K.W. Chen J.-S. Raikhel A.S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and that “head factors” affect yolk protein uptake by oocytes (25Koller C.N. Raikhel A.S. J. Insect Physiol. 1991; 37: 703-711Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, the structural characterization of OEH I provides clues for the identification of related peptides that may be evolutionarily conserved for regulation of gonad steroidogenesis in other insects and invertebrates.

Each of these pathways, which have been found in all eukaryotes from unicellular organisms to plants and animals, contains regulatory molecules upstream of a kinase module consisting of a MAP/ERK kinase kinase (MEKK) that phosphorylates and activates a MEK that, in turn, phosphorylates and activates an ERK (13Neiman A.M. Stevenson B.J. Xu H.-P. Sprague Jr., G.F. Herskowitz I. Wigler M. Marcus S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These kinase modules are differentially responsive to a variety of cellular signals and contribute to the generation of distinct cellular outcomes. Over a dozen MAP kinase family members have been identified in mammals. Many of these lie in the three best delineated mammalian MAP kinase modules (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

These are the mammalian ERK module (consisting of Raf isoforms, MEK1, MEK2, ERK1, and ERK2), which responds strongly to mitogenic signals in most cells and two modules that are often activated by stress stimuli, the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and the p38 pathways. The ERK and stress-sensitive pathways are transducers of proliferative, differentiating, and inflammatory signals throughout the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Analysis of the yeast genome indicates the presence of at least five yeast MAP kinases (14Hunter T. Plowman G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). An extrapolation based on the greater complexity of mammalian genomes suggests that there may be more than 50 MAP kinases in mammals. Identifying novel MAP kinases and delineating their regulation and specificities will provide important information about molecular mechanisms underlying signal transduction and its specificity. Searches for novel MAP kinase cascades using homology cloning techniques, data base analysis, and antibodies have identified several orphan pathways. These include ERK3 kinase/ERK3, ERK4, and MEK5/ERK5 (15Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D.

Neither the signals activating these orphan pathways nor their substrates and the cellular outcomes of their activation have been determined. Because they were not identified in their natural physiological contexts, a variety of strategies to determine their roles in mammalian signaling are needed. Members of the MAP kinase family require dual phosphorylation for high activity and have not yet been successfully activated by mutagenesis (23Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K.

Thus, a general method to activate MAP kinases will be of considerable value because in most cases an active upstream MEK with the appropriate specificity will be unavailable. To discover novel MAP kinase pathways, we used a PCR-based screen to isolate cDNA clones of previously unknown MEKs, the constituents of the module with the greatest substrate specificity. One such clone encoded MEK5 (20English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Its putative downstream target ERK5 was cloned both in a two-hybrid screen with MEK5 and in a screen for novel ERKs (21Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 22Lee J. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). No substrates for ERK5 have been identified, and no extracellular stimuli have been shown to highly activate ERK5 or MEK5. As a first step in understanding this pathway, we wanted to identify ERK5 substrates and activators upstream of MEK5 in the cascade. Because we were not successful in activating MEK5 either in vitro orin vivo, we chose to exploit our understanding of MAP kinase structure to circumvent this problem. Herein we describe a novel approach using chimeric proteins consisting of the orphan MAP kinase ERK5 and a well studied MAP kinase, ERK2, the activators of which have been identified. A chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal domain of ERK2 (subdomains I–IV) and the C-terminal domain of the ERK5 catalytic core (subdomains V–XI) contains the protein substrate binding regions of ERK5. This chimera is expected to display a protein substrate specificity identical to ERK5 itself (29Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M.

Science. 1996; 272: 1653-1655Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Using an activated form of this chimera, we found that the product of the c-myc proto-oncogene (33Rabbitts T.H. Hamlyn P.H. Baer R. Nature. 1983; 306: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Rabbitts T.H. Forster A. Hamlyn P.H. Baer R. Nature. 1984; 309: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was an ERK5 substrate, which facilitated the further analysis of this orphan MAP kinase module. Potential activators of the pathway were tested using c-Myc as the ERK5 substrate. We demonstrate here that the ERK5 catalytic domain is activated by a constitutively active form of H-Ras but not by constitutively active Raf. These findings indicate that the ERK5 cascade lies in a newly identified Ras effector pathway. To construct a truncated form of ERK5 (ERK5kin), the sequence encoding amino acids 1–409 was subcloned into the XbaI and XhoI sites of pGEX-KG using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Full-length human ERK5 in pCDNAIII (generously provided by J. D. Lee, Scripps Institute, San Diego, CA) was used as template with primers that insertedXbaI and XhoI sites. The sequence of this clone contained nucleotide differences compared with the previously published sequence (22Lee J. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) that specified valine rather than alanine at residue 23. Full-length ERK5 was subcloned into pGEX-KG by digesting pCDNAIII/ERK5 with XbaI and filling in with Klenow enzyme. After digestion with SphI, the sequence following the catalytic domain of ERK5 (ERK5 tail) was ligated into pGEX-KG/ERK5kin previously digested with SphI and aXhoI site blunt ended with Klenow enzyme. The inactive ERK5kin mutant K84M (25Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

The 3′ primer encoded a methionine in place of lysine 84 and spanned a unique BstEII site. The 5′ primer added aXhoI site. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into theXhoI and BstEII sites of pGEX-KG/ERK5kin. To create chimeras between human ERK5 and rat ERK2 (Fig. 1 A), the four PCR products encoding the residues indicated below were generated using Vent polymerase and oligomers that added the appropriate restriction enzyme sites for subcloning into the following sites of pGEX-KG: 1) N terminus of ERK5 (amino acids 1–139), XbaI and SacI; 2) N terminus of ERK2 (amino acids 1–105), NcoI and SacI; 3) C terminus of ERK5kin (amino acids 140–409), SacI and HindIII; and 4) C terminus of ERK2 (amino acids 106–358)SacI–HindIII. In each case, a SacI site was introduced that resulted in a conservative Asp → Glu mutation at amino acid 138 of ERK5 and amino acid 104 of ERK2 (Fig.1 B). pGEX-KG/ERK5kin and NpT75/ERK2 were used as the templates for the PCRs. The chimeras were prepared by digesting the N-terminal constructs with SacI and HindIII. The PCR products encoding the C-terminal domains were first digested with HindIII followed by a partial digestion with SacI. The appropriate SacI–HindIII fragment was then ligated into pGEX-KG containing the appropriate N-terminal domain. The sequences of the junctions were VQELMESDLH for ERK2/5 and VLELMETDLY for ERK5/2 (Fig. 1 B). The ERK5/2 chimera was digested with NheI and XhoI (these sites were added by the original PCR oligomers) and subcloned into theNheI and SalI sites of pCEP4HAB. All constructs derived from PCR were sequenced to confirm that no changes in coding sequence had been introduced. Bacteria were grown at 30 °C, and 40 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was used to induce expression of all proteins. Expression of glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-ERK5kin and GST-ERK5kin K84M was induced for 8 h; GST-ERK5, GST-ERK5/2, GST-ERK2/5, and GST-ERK2/5-P (the phosphorylated form from coexpression with MEK1R4F, a constitutively active mutant of MEK1) were induced for 18 h. The GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose using standard protocols (36Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged (His6) ERK2 (25Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Active ERK2, p38, and SAPKα were prepared as described (40Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Kyriakis (Harvard) and J. Han (Scripps). Protein kinases and substrates were incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 50 μm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (10–30 cpm/fmol)) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 7 μl of 5× electrophoresis sample buffer and heated for 2 min at 100 °C. Substrates used were myelin basic protein (MBP), GST-Mnk-1, and the following fusion fragments: GST-Myc-(1–143), GST-ATF2-(1–254), GST-Elk-1-(1–205), and GST-Tal2-(53–108). Substrate protein concentrations were equalized by Coomassie Blue staining of the correct band in the recombinant protein preparation and were approximately 0.1 mg/ml in the kinase reactions. MBP was used as the screening substrate, because it is commonly phosphorylated by MAP kinase family members. However, because many other kinases phosphorylate MBP, c-Myc fragments were used as the ERK5 substrate in subsequent assays. Significantly less Elk-1 was assayed than other protein substrates. Thus, its capacity to serve as a substrate for a given MAP kinase may be underestimated. ERK5kin and ERK5 were subcloned from the corresponding pGEX-KG constructs into pCEP4HAB to incorporate the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag. Both were subcloned into the NheI and XhoI sites using restriction sites that had been added by the PCR primers with blunt ending with Klenow enzyme for ERK5. pCMV5/V12Ras, pCMV5/Raf-1, pCMV5/Raf-1S259D, and pCMV5/Raf BXB were as described (41Frost J.A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Jeff Frost. pCMV5/MEKK1 was provided by Shuichan Xu (42Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B.

Cells were transfected at 50–80% confluency using calcium phosphate DNA coprecipitation (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and harvested 48 h after transfection; the last 12–18 h of transfection were in the absence of serum. Cell lysates were prepared in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. For assays of ERK5kin activity, 293 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of pCMV/V12 H-Ras and 5 μg of pCEP4HA/ERK5kin, and HA-ERK5kin was harvested by immunoprecipitation. A synthetic peptide (RISAAAALRHPFLAKY) derived from subdomain XI of ERK5 was conjugated to Limulus polyphemus hemocyanin and injected into rabbits as described (19Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) generating anti-ERK5 antiserum S741. Equal amounts of protein were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels in sodium dodecyl sulfate for immunoblotting with S741 or Y691 as described (19Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 42Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Transfected V12 H-Ras was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody purchased from CalBiochem (OP40). Raf-1 and Raf mutants were detected using an antibody from Santa Cruz (SC133). Dually phosphorylated active endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 were detected using a rabbit antibody from Promega (V6671) as described previously (44Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Lysates from transfected cells were probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope tag (12CA5, Babco, Richmond, CA) to estimate the amount of HA-ERK5 in each lysate. Lysate volumes containing equal amounts of HA-ERK5 were incubated with the anti-HA antibody and protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. The beads were washed once with lysis buffer; three times with 0.25 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl; and once with 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0. Kinase assays were performed with 20 μl of beads in a 50-μl reaction. Reaction conditions were the same as described above except that 100 nmstaurosporine was added. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 13 μl of 5× electrophoresis sample buffer. To probe the function and regulation of ERK5, we utilized chimeric proteins fusing individual domains of ERK2, the activators and substrates of which have been identified, to the complementary domains of the orphan MAP kinase ERK5. A region that connects the N-terminal to the C-terminal domain of ERK2 and ERK5, in the vicinity of kinase subdomain V, was selected as the site to fuse the chimeras (Fig. 1, A and B). A consideration of sequences and structures of protein kinases indicates that this is a variable region and that chimeras formed at this point between the two domains are unlikely to contain disrupted tertiary structures (29Knighton D.R.

Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The ERK2/ERK5 chimera contained residues 1–105 of ERK2 and 140–409 of ERK5. ERK5 contains an extension of approximately 400 residues C-terminal to the conserved MAP kinase core sequence; these residues were truncated from the ERK2/5 chimera so that each chimera could be compared with wild type ERK2. The ERK5/ERK2 chimera contained residues 1–139 of ERK5 and 106–358 of ERK2. An ERK5 mutant, ERK5kin, was truncated after residue 409 of ERK5 as a control for the chimeras and for comparison to ERK2. This mutant contains the complete kinase domain of ERK5 and is roughly equal in length to ERK2. The chimeras were expressed as GST fusion proteins, and the presence of the appropriate C-terminal domain in each chimera was confirmed by Western blotting with antipeptide antibodies (Fig. 1 C). Full-length ERK5 sometimes contains breakdown products as revealed by smaller immunoreactive bands. Without activation, the protein kinase activity of the ERK5/2 chimera strongly resembled wild type ERK2, with a specific activity toward MBP in the low nmol/min/mg range (Fig.2 A). On the other hand, the activity of the ERK2/5 chimera, like that of ERK5 itself, was below the limit of detection under the same conditions. Based on findings described below, this is most likely due to a very low basal activity and not to an inability to recognize MBP. Previously published results with p38/ERK1 chimeras suggested that the N-terminal domain of a MAP kinase family member would determine which regulatory events would activate the chimeric enzyme (32Brunet A. Pouysségur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1653-1655Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). If this is generally correct for other family members, then the ERK5/2 chimera should fail to be activated by MEK1 or MEK2 of the ERK2 pathway. We therefore determined whether the constitutively active MEK1 mutant MEK1R4F (47Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) phosphorylated and activated the ERK5/2 chimera in vitro. The activity of the ERK5/2 chimera increased significantly upon treatment with MEK1R4F (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that it is recognized as a consequence of the C-terminal domain of ERK2. To confirm that activation of the chimera was not due to the ability of MEK1 to recognize ERK5, ERK5kin was also tested as a MEK1 substrate; phosphorylation of MBP by ERK5kin was not enhanced by prior incubation with MEK1R4F (Fig. 2 A). In keeping with the activity data, ERK5/2 was phosphorylated weakly by MEK1R4F, whereas ERK5 was not (data not shown). These results indicate that the C-terminal domain also contributes to recognition of MAP kinases by MEKs and, further, that the ERK5/2 chimera will not selectively respond to ERK5 activators. To search for ERK5 substrates using the ERK2/5 chimera, attempts were made to activate the ERK2/5 chimera with MEK1R4F in vitro. The ERK2/5 chimera was a poor in vitro substrate MEK1. Thus, to activate the ERK2/5 chimera, we utilized the bacterial coexpression system that we had previously developed to produce other purified phosphorylated MAP kinases (40Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). GST-ERK2/5 was expressed from one plasmid in bacteria either with or without coexpression of MEK1R4F from a second plasmid (Fig. 2 B). Coexpression of ERK2/5 with MEK1R4F resulted in activation of GST-ERK2/5, as assessed by its enhanced ability to phosphorylate MBP (Fig. 2 C), even though it was not activated by MEK1R4F in vitro. Compared with three other purified active MAP kinase family members examined, the activity of the activated ERK2/5 chimera was lower, and its substrate specificity was distinct (Fig. 3, A and B). Under a defined set of conditions, the chimera phosphorylated MBP and an N-terminal fragment of c-Myc to a greater extent than the other MAP kinase substrates tested. The chimera did not phosphorylate the ternary complex factor Elk-1, the transcriptional regulators ATF2 and Tal2, or the protein kinase Mnk-1 well (Fig. 3, A and B) (39Gille H. Kortenjann M.

In contrast, p38, which had approximately the same relative activity toward MBP and c-Myc, also phosphorylated ATF2 and Mnk-1 equivalently, whereas ERK2 phosphorylated Mnk-1 and Elk-1. SAPKα phosphorylated ATF2 strongly but MBP to a much lesser extent than the ERK5/2 chimera. Both SAPKα and ERK2 phosphorylated Elk-1 sufficiently to induce an electrophoretic mobility shift, whereas p38 did not (Fig. 3 A). In addition, the chimera phosphorylated its putative upstream regulator MEK5 (Fig.4 A). In contrast, MEK5 was not a substrate fo"

The rat brain voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channel is composed of three glycoprotein subunits: the pore-forming α subunit with a relative molecular mass of 260 kDa, and two auxiliary subunits, β1 (36 kDa) and β2 (33 kDa) (for review, see Refs. 1Catterall W.A.

In addition, the extracellular domains of the β1 and β2 subunits have sequences similar to those of proteins of the immunoglobulin (Ig) 1The abbreviations used are: Ig, immunoglobulin;Ff and Fs, fraction of channel in fast and slow gating mode, respectively; τf and τs, time constants in fast and slow mode, respectively; P0, protein zero. superfamily and are proposed to contain an Ig-like motif (5Isom L.L.

The β2 subunit is linked covalently to the α subunit by disulfide bonds, whereas the β1 subunit associates with the α subunit in a noncovalent manner (7Messner D.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

Biochemical analyses of detergent-solubilized rat brain Na+channels suggest that both ionic and hydrophobic interactions are important in association of β1 with the α·β2 complex (7Messner D.J.

Na+ channel inactivation is accelerated 5-fold, the voltage dependence of inactivation is shifted in the negative direction, and a larger fraction of channels recovers rapidly from inactivation. In addition, the amplitude of peak Na+ current is increased, consistent with an increase in channel expression. In Chinese hamster lung cells, coexpression of β1 with the type IIA α subunit results in hyperpolarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of Na+channel activation and inactivation and increased channel expression (11Isom L.L.

The β1 subunit modulates the gating and expression of a variety of Na+ channel α subunits (10Patton D.E. Isom L.L. Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. J. Biol.

Pfluegers Arch. 1993; 423: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction domains of these two proteins are well conserved. In the present study we examine the structural features of the β1 subunit which are required for efficient modulation of rat brain type IIA α subunits. We demonstrate that the intracellular domain of β1 is unnecessary and that the extracellular domain is essential for expression and function of the α·β1 complex in Xenopusoocytes. A combinatorial approach using deletion mutagenesis, alanine-scanning mutagenesis, and chimeric protein analyses supports the hypothesis that the extracellular domain forms an Ig fold that is essential for β1 expression and function. Through analysis of these mutants we have implicated the A/A′ strand of the Ig fold in the β1 extracellular domain in interactions between β1 and α subunits. This region is localized on a presumed surface-exposed edge of the Ig fold motif. While our experiments were in progress, deletion and chimeric mutagenesis studies of the modulation of skeletal muscle Na+ channels by β1 subunits were reported (15Chen C.F. Cannon S.C. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 431: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Makita N. Bennett P.B. George Jr., A.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7117-7127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results are compared with our data under “Discussion.” The deletion of the β1 intracellular domain (Fig. 1 A, Δ1) and the large internal deletion of the β1 extracellular domain (Fig.1 A, Δ2) were constructed in the Bluescript pSK− phagemid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Subsequent analyses of wild-type and mutant β1 subunits were performed in the pβ1.SK+ vector in which the entire coding sequence of the rat brain β1 subunit and 3′-untranslated region, including polyadenylation sequences, were cloned into Bluescript pSK+(Stratagene). The pβ1.SK− and pβ1.SK+vectors were constructed in a manner that eliminated a portion of the β1 5′-untranslated region which had been found previously to interfere with expression (10Patton D.E. Isom L.L. Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17649-17655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion of the β1 intracellular domain (Fig. 1 A, Δ1) was accomplished via polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis by the substitution of a termination signal (TAA) for the Ile166 codon. The large internal deletion (Fig. 1 A, Δ2) of the β1 extracellular domain was constructed by an in-frame removal of a BstYI fragment. Two sets of three nested deletions in the cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of the β1 subunit were produced by oligonucleotide-directed “loop out” deletion mutagenesis (Fig.1 A, Δ3–Δ8). The NH2-terminal signal sequence was maintained in all deletion mutants to facilitate proper membrane insertion and post-translational processing. Single stranded pβ1.SK+ DNA was prepared by helper phage infection and served as the mutagenesis template. Deletion mutagenesis reactions were performed using the Oligonucleotide-directed In Vitro Mutagenesis System Version 2 or SculptorTMprotocols (Amersham Corp.). Ala substitutions, A/A′ strand charge neutralizations, and β1/P0 chimeras were constructed in B1.M13Mp18 by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis reactions were according to the protocol of Kunkel et al.(17Kunkel T.A. Roberts J. Zakour R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Mutants were identified by DNA sequencing or by incorporation of a silent restriction endonuclease site and then subcloned into the pβ1.SK+ phagemid. Sequences of the mutant constructs were determined by automated sequence analysis performed by the DNA Core of the Molecular Pharmacology Facility, Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington. RNA transcripts were obtained using the mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription protocol (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Transcripts were purified by sedimentation through columns of Sephadex G-50. The rat αIIA subunit was transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase from plasmid pVA2580 (18Auld V.J. Goldin A.L. Krafte D.S. Catterall W.A. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Dunn R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which had been linearized with ClaI. The β1Δ1 construct was linearized with HindIII, and RNA was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. The β1Δ2 construct was linearized with EcoRI, and RNA was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. Wild-type and mutant β1 constructs in pβ1.SK+ were linearized with HindIII, and RNA was transcribed using T3 RNA polymerase. Xenopus laevis oocytes were harvested, defolliculated with collagenase, and maintained as described (19McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12025-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with a 50-nl volume of an RNA mixture containing 0.5–1.25 ng of αIIA transcript and a 5–20-fold excess of mutant β1 subunit transcript, unless otherwise stated in the figure legends. Competition experiments were employed to determine if the ability to associate with the αIIA subunit was retained in mutant β1 subunits that showed decreased modulatory β1 function. In these experiments, αIIA and wild-type β1 subunits were injected in combination with the mutant β1 subunit. If the mutant β1 subunit is capable of binding to the αIIAsubunit, less than maximum β1 function should be observed when analyzed by electrophysiological methods. Alternatively, wild-type β1 function in the expressing mutant β1 oocytes would indicate an inability of the mutant β1 to bind to the αIIA subunit. In all experiments, oocytes injected with only αIIAtranscript or αIIA coinjected with wild-type β1 RNA served as controls. After 48 h at 20 °C, expressed Na+ channels were examined at room temperature by two-electrode voltage clamp (Dagan CA1, Minneapolis, MN; see Ref. 19McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12025-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Voltage pulses were applied, and data were recorded using the Basic-Fastlab data acquisition system (Indec Systems, Capitola, CA). Linear capacity currents were canceled using the internal voltage clamp circuitry. Residual linear currents were subtracted using the P/4 procedure (20Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Signals were low pass filtered at 2 kHz. The amplitude of expressed Na+ currents was typically 1–10 μA. The bath was perfused continuously with Frog Ringer containing 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Na+currents were elicited by step depolarizations to 0 mV from a holding potential of −90 mV. Prepulses of 100-ms duration to various voltages, followed by a test pulse to 0 mV, were used to examine the voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation of Na+channels. Na+ channel current-voltage relationships were determined from peak currents elicited by 30-ms steps to various test voltages from a holding potential of -90 mV. Recovery from inactivation was examined by applying a 15-ms conditioning pulse to 0 mV from a holding potential of -90 mV followed by a recovery interval of variable duration and a test pulse to 0 mV. Representative normalized current traces obtained from oocytes coinjected with αIIA and mutant β1 RNA transcripts were plotted with normalized averaged current traces from a contemporaneous pool of control oocytes containing only αIIA transcript or αIIA in combination with wild-type β1 transcripts. The standard deviation of the control oocyte traces was calculated and is plotted as dotted lines in each figure. Additional statistical analyses were performed on current traces obtained from oocytes coinjected with αIIA and β1(E4Q/D6N/E8Q). To determine the mean fractions of Na+channels in the slow and fast gating mode (Fs and Ff) and the corresponding time constants (τs and τf), the decay phase of Na+current traces was fit to a single exponential or a sum of two exponentials. Current traces obtained from oocytes injected with only the αIIA transcript were well fit by a single exponential. Two exponentials were used to fit the traces obtained from oocytes coinjected with transcripts encoding αIIA and wild-type β1 or with αIIA and β1(E4Q/D6N/E8Q) transcripts. Through these analyses it was determined that the time constants obtained from current traces from oocytes expressing the αIIA and β1(E4QD6NE8Q) transcripts (τs = 4.58 ± 1.42 ms,τf = 0.917 ± 0.474 ms, n = 6) did not vary significantly from τs values for αIIA control cells (τs = 4.74 ± 0.62 ms, n= 6) or τf values obtained from control oocytes that coexpressed the αIIA and wild-type β1 subunits (τf = 0.892 ± 0.156 ms, n = 7). Student's t test pvalues for comparisons of the time constants for αIIA + β1(E4QD6NE8Q) with control time constants were 0.90 and 0.46 for τs and τf, respectively, confirming that the differences between these values were not significant. To obtain accurate values for the fraction of oocytes gating in the fast mode (Ff) and slow mode (Fs), current traces from oocytes expressing αIIA alone, αIIA and wild-type β1, or αIIA and β1(E4QD6NE8Q), and from oocytes expressing combinations of these subunits in competition experiments were refit using mean values of the control cell τs and τf values defined above. The values for Ff and Fs obtained from these fits were compared, and the significance of the observed differences was determined by t test analyses. Data obtained from experiments measuring recovery from inactivation were normalized and fit with either one or two exponentials, as described in the figure legends. TheFf, Fs, and corresponding τ values of channel recovery from inactivation were determined from the fits. An important step in understanding the mechanism by which the β1 subunit modulates α subunit function is to determine which domains of β1 participate in α-β1 interactions and subsequent modulation of channel gating. To test the role of the intracellular domain, a truncated rat brain β1 subunit, lacking the intracellular domain, was constructed by the insertion of a stop codon at the position normally encoding Ile166 (Fig. 1 A, Δ1). Lys residues at positions 164 and 165, immediately following the proposed transmembrane segment, were retained to maintain proper membrane orientation. Xenopus oocytes were prepared and coinjected with in vitro transcribed RNA encoding the adult rat type IIA α subunit alone or in combination with wild-type or mutant β1 subunits. Na+ currents were recorded from the injected oocytes at room temperature using a two-electrode voltage clamp. Na+ channels containing only αIIA subunits inactivated slowly (Fig. 1 B, trace a), whereas those containing αIIA and wild-type β1 inactivated more rapidly (Fig. 1 B, trace b). Coinjection of RNA encoding the truncated β1 subunit and αIIA subunit in Xenopus oocytes resulted in rapidly inactivating Na+ currents that were similar to those seen when the αIIA was coexpressed with the wild-type β1 subunit (Fig. 1 B, trace c). Because both the wild-type and truncated β1 subunits induced predominantly fast inactivating channels, the intracellular domain of the β1 subunit is not necessary for either the association of Na+ channel α and β1 subunits or for functional modulation of the α subunit by the β1 subunit. The importance of the extracellular domain was investigated further by a series of deletion mutations (Fig. 1 A). An internal deletion of the extracellular domain was constructed which removed amino acids Ile51 through Lys122 (Fig. 1 A, Δ2). When the α subunit was coexpressed with the Ile51-Lys122 deletion mutant in Xenopus oocytes, the resulting Na+ currents were similar to those of channels composed of α subunits alone (data not shown), indicating that the large internal deletion of the extracellular domain prevented expression and/or function of the β1 subunit. To investigate further the importance of the extracellular domain, nested deletions in the cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of the β1 subunit were produced by oligonucleotide-directed loop out mutagenesis (Fig. 1 A, Δ3–Δ8). The time courses of Na+ currents resulting from coinjection of α with the smallest of these β1 deletion mutants (Δ3, Gly1-Phe40, Fig. 1 B, trace d; Δ6 Val119-Ser140, Fig. 1 B, trace e) indicated that they decayed at a rate similar to channels consisting of only the α subunit. Similar results were obtained for each electrophysiological parameter tested for these and the remaining deletion mutants. In addition, β1 subunits harboring either Δ3 (Gly1-Phe40) or Δ6 (Val119-Ser140) were unable to compete with the wild-type β1 subunit for binding to αIIA (data not shown; for a description of the competition experiments, see “Experimental Procedures”). These results highlight the requirement for the integrity of the extracellular domain for function of the β1 subunit. The extracellular domain of the β1 subunit contains four potential sites forN-linked glycosylation at Asn74, Asn91, Asn95, and Asn116 (4Isom L.L. De Jongh K.S. Patton D.E. Reber B.F.X. Offord J. Charbonneau H. Walsh K. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Science. 1992; 256: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and biochemical experiments show that β1 subunits have at least threeN-linked carbohydrate chains (21Messner D.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10597-10604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of these sites in the modulation of Na+ channel gating by the β1 subunit, the Asn residues of all four sites were mutated individually to Gln. These mutant subunits showed no significant loss of β1 function, as assessed in theXenopus oocyte expression system (Fig.2). The adjacent glycosylation sites at Asn91 and Asn95 were also altered simultaneously. The resulting β1 double mutant behaved normally, like the single site mutants (Fig. 2). These results show that none of theN-linked glycosylation sites is required for expression and function of β1 subunits. Data-base searches found sequence similarities between the β1 extracellular domain and members of the Ig fold superfamily (5Isom L.L. Ragsdale D.S. De Jongh K.S. Westenbroek R.E. Reber B.F.X. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar,6Isom L.L. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The resemblance is closest with the V-like family of Ig fold proteins, which contain domains resembling the variable regions of antibodies and include many cell adhesion molecules and cell recognition proteins (22Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 23Vaughn D.E. Bjorkman P.J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The β1 extracellular domain has the highest degree of similarity to that of myelin protein zero (P0), with 36% identity and 49% similarity over a 70-amino acid segment (5Isom L.L. Ragsdale D.S. De Jongh K.S. Westenbroek R.E. Reber B.F.X. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). P0 is the major protein in peripheral nerve myelin and mediates the wrapping of myelin sheaths via homophilic interactions (23Vaughn D.E. Bjorkman P.J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Its structure has been studied by molecular modeling (24Wells C.A. Saavedra R.A. Inouye H. Kirschner D.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of the rat P0 extracellular domain (P0ex) was determined recently at 1.9 Å resolution (25Shapiro L. Doyle J.P. Hensley P. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 435-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Both analyses show that P0ex is folded as a V-like Ig domain. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the β1 subunit and P0ex (Fig. 3 A) reveals that both conform closely to a consensus sequence for V-like Ig folds, like many cell adhesion molecules (23Vaughn D.E. Bjorkman P.J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The β strands A–G that form the Ig fold are highlighted in Fig. 3 A and are illustrated in their three-dimensional organization in Fig.3 B. In this alignment Cys21 of the β1 subunit is shown in register with the Cys residues that form the disulfide bond in the Ig fold of P0 rather than Cys24 as in our previous alignment (6Isom L.L. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), because this fits the new x-ray structure (25Shapiro L. Doyle J.P. Hensley P. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 435-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and the new V-like consensus (23Vaughn D.E. Bjorkman P.J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) more closely. The remaining Cys residues of the β1 extracellular domain, Cys2 and Cys24, are in close proximity in our Ig fold model and may form an additional disulfide bridge between the beginning of the A strand and the end of the B strand. In addition to the invariant Cys residues in β strands B and F, other important Ig- fold residues, such as the Gly preceding strand B, the Trp in strand C, and the Arg in strand D, are aligned precisely in the folding model of β1 (Fig.3 B), and many other requirements for a V-like Ig fold are fulfilled (Fig. 3 A). Myelin protein P0 therefore provides a molecular template for analysis of the structure of the β1 subunit based on its three-dimensional structure illustrated in Fig.3 B. The Ig fold motif is a “sandwich” of two β sheets. Side chains from both β sheets form a hydrophobic core at the interface between the β sheets by interaction of the alternating hydrophobic amino acids in the primary sequence of core β strands. The central hydrophobic core, composed primarily of β strands B and E in one sheet and strands C, C′, and F in the other, is crucial for the maintenance of the Ig fold (22Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). The central core of the Ig fold serves as a scaffold for the presentation of sites involved in molecular recognition, cell adhesion, and ligand binding. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis (26Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar) was employed to test whether the central core of the Ig fold is necessary for expression and function of the β1 subunits. Ala was chosen as the replacement amino acid because it has a small side chain and does not introduce electrostatic effects or alter the main chain conformation. Although Ala is a strong α-helix former, it shows a significant propensity for β sheet formation and is found in both buried and exposed positions (27Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar, 28Chothia C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 537-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 29O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 250: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 30Mino Jr., D.L. Kim P.S. Nature. 1994; 367: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Replacement of hydrophobic amino acid residues in the core of proteins with Ala has been shown not to cause global structural change (31Eriksson A.E. Baase W.A. Zhang X.-J. Heinz D.W. Blaber M. Baldwin E.P. Matthews B.W. Science. 1992; 255: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). However, in the case of an Ig fold, substitution of Ala for multiple hydrophobic amino acids in a β strand that contributes to the hydrophobic core of the Ig fold should disrupt the tertiary structure of the domain. The alanine-scanning mutagenesis survey of proposed β strands in the β1 extracellular domain is summarized in Fig.4 A. The substitution of Ala for multiple large, hydrophobic amino acids in the mutants AS-1, AS-2, AS-3, AS-5, and AS-6 resulted in slowly inactivating Na+currents resembling those exhibited by the α subunit in the absence of β1 (Fig. 4 B). In AS-2, the substitution of Ala for three amino acids in the C strand, Phe35, Trp38, and Phe40, resulted in a loss of β1 function (Fig. 4 B, traced). A Trp residue at the position of Trp38 is highly conserved among V-like domains (22Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 23Vaughn D.E. Bjorkman P.J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In myelin P0, the side chain of this Trp residue packs against the disulfide bond formed between β strands B and F in the hydrophobic interface between the two β sheets (25Shapiro L. Doyle J.P. Hensley P. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 435-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The substitution of Ala for Trp38, combined with the F35A and F40A mutations most likely resulted in a perturbation of the Ig fold hydrophobic core. A similar disruption of hydrophobic interactions in the central core of the Ig fold is likely to be responsible for the effects of mutations AS-1, AS-3, AS-5, and AS-6. None of β1 subunits harboring the deleterious alanine cluster mutations was capable of competing with the wild-type β1 subunit for binding to αIIA (data not shown), which suggests that the alanine substitutions either dramatically inhibited α-β1 interactions or prevented β1 folding and cell surface expression. In contrast to the effects of mutations in these central core β strands, the mutation of three hydrophobic amino acid residues in the D strand in the AS-4 mutant (Fig. 4 C, trace f) had no effect on expression and function of β1 subunits. A similar result was observed for"
https://openalex.org/W1978019490,"Abstract Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is found in the cell nucleus and has been implicated in several aspects of nuclear function. We report here the cloning and initial characterization of a novel protein ∼ named phosphatase 1 nucleartargeting subunit (PNUTS). This protein interacts with PP1 in a yeast two-hybrid assay, is found in a stable complex with PP1 in mammalian cell lysates, and exhibits a potent modulation of PP1 catalytic activity toward exogenous substratein vitro. PNUTS is a ubiquitously expressed protein that exhibits a discreet nuclear compartmentalization and is colocalized with chromatin at distinct phases during mitosis. The subcellular localization of PP1 and the activity toward substrates involved in many aspects of cell physiology have previously been shown to be regulated by association with noncatalytic targeting subunits. The properties of PNUTS are consistent with its role as a targeting subunit for the regulation of nuclear PP1 function."
https://openalex.org/W2018045306,"We have isolated a novel cDNA clone from rat cerebral cortex encoding a protein of 670 amino acids (NCKX2) that has significant similarity to the 1199-amino acid-long Na/Ca-K exchanger of bovine rod outer segment (NCKX1). NCKX2 transcripts are 10.5 kilobase pairs in length and are expressed abundantly in neurons throughout the brain and with much lower abundance in selected other tissues. The predicted topology of the rat NCKX2 protein is very similar to that of bovine NCKX1, beginning with a solitary transmembrane segment (M0), which is removed as a “signal peptide” in bovine NCKX1, an extracellular loop, a cluster of five transmembrane spanning segments (M1 to M5), a long cytoplasmic loop, and a final hydrophobic cluster (M6 to M11). Within the hydrophobic clusters, rat NCKX2 shares 80% identity and 91% similarity with bovine NCKX1. The two larger hydrophilic loops are much shorter in NCKX2 than in NCKX1, accounting largely for the difference in length between the two proteins, and are dissimilar in sequence except for a 32-amino acid stretch with 69% identity in the cytosolic loop. NCKX2 was epitope-tagged in the extracellular domain and was shown to be expressed at the surface of transfected HEK cells.

NCKX2 was epitope-tagged in the extracellular domain and was shown to be expressed at the surface of transfected HEK cells. Analysis of NCKX2 function by fluorescent imaging of fura-2-loaded transfected cells demonstrated that NCKX2 is a potassium-dependent sodium/calcium exchanger. A plasma membrane sodium-calcium exchange process plays an important role in controlling cytosolic calcium concentrations in a broad number of tissues (1Lederer W.J. He S. Luo S. duBell W. Kofuji P. Kieval R. Neubauer C.F. Ruknudin A. Cheng H. Cannell M.B. Rogers T.B. Schulze D.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Detailed functional and structural studies have revealed the existence of two classes of protein that underlie the sodium-calcium exchange process. One class, exemplified by the sodium-calcium exchanger from dog heart, NCX1, 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SSCP, standard saline citrate phosphate; BES, N,N-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. catalyzes the exchange of three sodium ions for one calcium ion (2Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The other class, exemplified by the sodium-calcium + potassium exchanger of bovine retinal rod outer segments, NCKX1, transports four sodium ions in exchange for one calcium and one potassium ion (3Schnetkamp P.P.M. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). NCX1 is the most abundantly and widely expressed sodium-calcium exchanger gene, with products present in almost every tissue and present at a particularly high level in heart, brain, and kidney. Recent molecular studies have shown that expression of theNCX1 gene is driven by three separate promoters in a tissue specific fashion, giving rise to transcripts with unique 5′-untranslated region exons (4Lytton J. Lee S.-L. Lee W.-S. van Baal J. Bindels R.J.M. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. Silver J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 58-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a region of complex alternative splicing that results in several protein variants with sequence differences in a fairly short region near the carboxyl end of the central cytoplasmic domain of the molecule (5Schulze D.H. Kojufi P. Valdivia C. He S. Luo S. Ruknudin A. Wisel S. Kirby M.S. duBell W. Lederer W.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two other structurally and functionally homologous gene products have also been identified, NCX2 and NCX3, which are expressed selectively in brain and skeletal muscle, apparently at lower levels than NCX1 (6Nicoll D.A.

Mechanistically, the NCKX1 enzyme is quite similar to NCX1, although coupling of the potassium gradient and the increase in coupling of the sodium gradient to the thermodynamic driving force allow NCKX1 to control calcium levels in rods even when the membrane potential and sodium gradient are diminished in darkness (3Schnetkamp P.P.M. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Reeves J.P. Sutko J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3178-3182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schnetkamp P.P.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although the proposed overall topology of the molecule is similar—two clusters of five and six hydrophobic helices separated by a central large cytoplasmic loop—there is very little sequence similarity between NCX and NCKX molecules (10Reiländer H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspeich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, two short stretches, one in each hydrophobic helix cluster, do show significant similarity. Interestingly, these regions are the sites of highest conservation among sodium-calcium exchangers cloned from various organisms. It was recently noted that the two regions are also similar to one another and thus may have arisen from an ancient gene duplication event, a finding that has led to the speculation that these sites may constitute the ion binding pocket required for transport across the membrane (11Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although NCKX1 expression appears to be restricted to retinal photoreceptors, there is some evidence for a sodium-calcium + potassium exchange process in other tissues. Synaptic plasma membrane preparations from rat brain have been shown to possess sodium-calcium exchange, which is partially dependent upon potassium and is not mimicked by other monovalent alkali cations like lithium. In addition, uptake of rubidium (acting as a congener for potassium) was stimulated in the presence of sodium-calcium exchange (13Dahan D. Spanier R. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2067-2075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This potassium dependence is distinct from the well characterized monovalent cation effect on the cardiac-type NCX1 (14Condrescu M. Rojas H. Gerardi A. DiPolo R. Beaugé L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Slaughter R.S. Sutko J.L. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3183-3190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that brain may express both potassium-dependent and potassium-independent sodium-calcium exchangers. Human platelets have also been shown to possess a sodium-calcium exchange activity that is dependent upon potassium (16Kimura M. Aviv A. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6874-6877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence of these observations, we have searched for potassium-dependent sodium-calcium exchangers using a homology approach based on the sequence of the cloned bovineNCKX1. We identified and isolated a full-length cDNA, called NCKX2, from rat brain that encodes a novel protein with extensive similarity to bovine NCKX1 in the hydrophobic regions and displays potassium-dependent sodium-calcium exchange activity when expressed in HEK-293 cells. All molecular procedures were performed essentially according to standard protocols (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Two primers were designed based on sequences of relatively low degeneracy from the end of putative transmembrane span 7 (amino acids 1053–1059, YLMVWWA) and the loop between transmembrane spans 10 and 11 (amino acids 1164–1170, WRMNKIL) of the bovine NCKX1 sequence (10Reiländer H.

RNA, isolated from various rat or mouse tissues according to the CsCl centrifugation procedure, was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) and Superscript II Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and amplified with the above primers at an annealing temperature of 42 °C. Products were analyzed on ethidium bromide-stained polyacrylamide gels, and bands of the expected size (351 nucleotides) were excised, subcloned, and sequenced. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from rat brain cerebral cortex by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. An oligo(dT)-primed size-fractionated (>4 kilobase pairs) cDNA library was constructed from this mRNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase and ligated using BstXI-EcoRI adapters into the vector pcDNA II (Invitrogen). Approximately 250,000 transformants in E. coli DH10B were plated and screened with a digoxigenin-UTP (Boehringer Mannheim)-labeled riboprobe, prepared from the PCR products described above, essentially as described previously (20Wu K.-D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C333-C341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several positive colonies were purified, and the plasmid DNA containing the longest insert (clone BC-1) was analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, Southern blotting, and DNA sequencing. Sequence analysis of this and subsequent clones was obtained on double-stranded templates either with [35S]αdCTPαS and Sequenase 2.0 (United States Biochemicals) or with the AmpliTaq FS kit from Perkin-Elmer. Fluorescently labeled sequencing reactions were analyzed at the University of Calgary Core DNA Services facility. The coding and 5′-untranslated regions were sequenced on both strands, whereas the majority of the 3′-untranslated region was sequenced only on one strand. The 5′-end of NCKX2 transcripts corresponding to the BC-1 clone was analyzed using inverse PCR essentially according to published accounts (21Zeiner M. Gehring U. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 1051-1053Google Scholar). In brief, 5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA from rat cerebral cortex was reverse transcribed with Superscript II using the gene-specific primer gsp1 (TCTAAGAGAGTTCTTTGACG) based on theBC-1 sequence. The cDNA was converted to second strand essentially as described previously (20Wu K.-D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C333-C341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), purified, phosphorylated, and ligated in dilute solution to circularize the cDNA fragments. Circles were then amplified using primers gsp2 (CAGAGGAGAAGCCAGTGATGTGACG) and gsp3 (GGCCCATGACAAGGCCAATGACTCG), which are also based on BC-1 sequence upstream from gsp1 and face away from each other. Amplified products were gel purified, subcloned, and sequenced. The location of the BC-1 clone with respect to its full-length cognate NCKX2 transcript was determined by RNase H digestion of annealed complexes between rat cerebral cortex mRNA and antisense primers based on sequence from either end of clone BC-1. Primers used were gsp1 and gsp3 (above), which anneal ∼180 and ∼30 nucleotides from the 5′-end of cloneBC-1, respectively, and gsp4 (TGGGCGAATCTTGCTTAAC), which anneals about 150 nucleotides from the 3′-end of clone BC-1. Two μg of poly(A)+ mRNA from rat cerebral cortex was annealed with 200 pmol of each primer in 25 μl of 130 KCl and 13 mm MgCl2 by heating to 65 °C for 5 min and then allowing the mixture to cool slowly to room temperature. Twenty-five μl of 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol containing 2 units of RNase H (Pharmacia) was added to each tube, and the digestion was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was then stopped with 2 μl of 0.5 mEDTA, pH 8, the RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, and the products were analyzed by Northern blot. Control reactions, one without primer and one without RNase H, were run in parallel. Samples of RNA were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to a nylon membranes by capillary diffusion overnight. The UV-cross-linked membranes were hybridized with a digoxigenin-UTP-labeled riboprobe according to the directions of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously (20Wu K.-D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C333-C341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probe was a 726-nucleotide HindIII fragment from the 5′-end of clone BC-1. Adult male Wistar rats were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (130 mmNaCl, 3 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2, 0.1 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2), and their brains were removed and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 6–8 μm cut in the horizontal plane were collected onto Fisher Plus slides.In situ hybridization was performed essentially according to published accounts (22Schaeren-Wiemers N.

The brain sections were dewaxed in xylene, hydrated through a graded ethanol:water series, treated with 20 μg/ml of proteinase K in PBS, postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, acylated with acetic anhydride, and then incubated overnight at 68 °C in a hybridization solution composed of 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 5× SSCP (1× SSCP is 120 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, 13 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.2), 0.01% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.01% Ficoll, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.25 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.1 mg/ml poly(A), and 0.5 μg/ml of base-hydrolyzed probe. The slides were then washed at 68 °C, first in 2× SSCP and subsequently in 0.2× SSCP, twice each for 20 min. The hybridized probe was detected using alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) diluted 1:1000, followed by incubation overnight with 4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate substrate solution. Primers flanking the presumed cytoplasmic domain, based on the sequence of BC-1 and including restriction sites and clamps (ncke4, CGTGGATTCGTCCAAGTAGAGAGATGG, and ncke5, CCGCTCGAGCTGCTTGCGGGTGTTGG) were used to amplify oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcribed rat brain RNA. Products were gel-purified, subcloned, and sequenced. A full-length clone encoding the NCKX2 protein was obtained by combining a fragment based on the inverse PCR product with a fragment from the BC-1 clone as follows. Rat cerebellum RNA was reverse transcribed using the specific primer gsp5 (CCTTTGGGTAGTCTCCC) and amplified using the primers gsp6 (CTAGGGCCCGTCACATC), which overlaps the ApaI site at position 229, and ncke3 (CGAGGGCCCACCAGAAGATCCAAGATGG), which comprises the initiator methionine codon plus one base of the subsequent codon, 17 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated sequence, and 7 additional nucleotides completing an ApaI site and a clamp sequence. The 257-nucleotide product was digested with ApaI and ligated with ApaI-digested 2.3-kilobase pair NsiI subclone (above). The resultant construct, which encoded a full-length NCKX2 open reading frame, was confirmed by sequencing from the 5′-end. So that the protein product encoded by this clone could be detected, a FLAG (24Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Biotechnology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar) epitope-tag sequence (amino acids DYKDDDDK) was inserted in place of the predicted extracellular sequence found at amino acids 90–97 (DLNDKIRD) using two chimeric primers, each encoding an overlapping segment of the FLAG sequence, as well as upstream flanking NCKX2 sequence (flagncke1: GTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTAAGAGAGTTCTTTG) or downstream flankingNCKX2 sequence (flagncke2: TACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTACACCCCACAGCCAC). One ng of the full-lengthNCKX2 construct (above) was used as template for two PCR reactions: (i) from the M13U primer sequence of the vector (GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGA) to the flagncke1 primer; (ii) from the flagncke2 primer to a specific primer just downstream of the XbaI site at position 682 (gsp7: CCAGGTCAGGTTTAAGATTTC). An aliquot of purified product from each of these reactions was combined together with primers M13U and gsp7 to amplify a fragment of about 780 base pairs, which was digested with KpnI and XbaI, subcloned, and sequenced. The KpnI-XbaI fragment was isolated from an appropriate clone and used to replace the corresponding fragment from the full-length NCKX2 construct above, to create a FLAG-tagged full-length NCKX2 clone. The ∼2.3-kilobase pair FLAG-NCKX2 fragment was then excised by digestion with KpnI and BamHI and ligated, blunt-ended, into the HindIII-digested mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). Transfection of Qiagen-purified FLAG-NCKX2 cDNA into HEK-293 cells was performed using a standard calcium-phosphate precipitation protocol with BES buffer essentially as described previously (25Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FLAG-NCKX2cDNA, cloned in the reverse orientation in the pMT2 vector (26Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), was used in control transfections. A clonal derivative of HEK-293 cells, which expresses the SV40 large T antigen, was originally obtained from Ron Kopito (Stanford University). Expression was analyzed 2 days following transfection. For protein expression studies, postnuclear extracts were prepared by solubilizing transfected cells in 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.14 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm TrisCl, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Crude microsome preparations were isolated as described previously (27Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence and calcium imaging experiments, cells were plated onto glass coverslips, which had been coated with 1 mg/ml protamine solution. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were performed essentially as described previously (27Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Kodak Scientific Imaging) at 5 μg/ml. For calcium imaging, transfected cells were loaded with 5 μmfura-2-AM, 0.01% pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) in serum-free DMEM medium for 20–30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then mounted in a perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments) on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope. Fura-2 fluorescence was captured through a Fluar × 20 objective and a Chroma filter set using the ImageMaster System and DeltaRAM rapid wavelength-switching illuminator from Photon Technology International. As part of our interest in molecular diversity of sodium-calcium exchangers, we used a reverse transcription-coupled PCR approach to search for novel molecules. Primers were designed from regions of low degeneracy within the carboxyl-terminal cluster of putative transmembrane helices of the bovine retinal rod outer segment Na/Ca-K exchanger, NCKX1. Products were amplified from both rat brain and eye RNA samples and very faintly from heart, but not from any other tissues tested. Cloning and sequencing of these bands revealed two species from eye, one of which was unique (I-14), and the other of which was identical with products in brain and heart (B-2). Comparison of these sequences with the bovine NCKX1 clone suggested that the unique eye clone I-14 was the rat equivalent of NCKX1 and the “brain” clone, B-2, was the product of a novel gene that we callNCKX2. The novel brain product B-2 was therefore used as a probe to screen at high stringency a cDNA library prepared from rat cerebral cortex mRNA in the vector pcDNAII. Several positive clones were isolated, the longest of which was 8.7 kilobase pairs. Partial sequence of this clone (called BC-1) revealed a sequence identical to that of the probe B-2 and a long open reading frame beginning at one end of the clone but without an initiator methionine. Thus, BC-1 did not contain the 5′-end of the transcript, nor was there a poly(A) tail or polyadenylation signal at the 3′-end of the clone. Northern analysis (see below, Fig.1) indicated that the major transcript corresponding to the BC-1 clone was 10.5 kilobase pairs in length. The position of the BC-1 clone within its cognate transcript was determined using RNase H digestion of complexes formed between rat cerebrum mRNA and antisense primers designed from sequence near either end of the BC-1 clone. Analysis by Northern blot of the digestion products revealed bands of about 9 and 10.2 kb from complexes formed with primers from the 3′- and 5′-ends of BC-1, respectively, compared with the 10.5 kb message found in control reactions (data not shown). This indicated that theBC-1 clone was missing approximately 1.5 kilobase pairs from the 3′ end but only about 300 nucleotides from the 5′ end. The technique of inverse PCR was used to obtain the missing 5′-end of the NCKX2 transcript. Multiple independently isolated clones all gave rise to the same fragment, extending 226 base pairs further 5′ than the BC-1 sequence. The combined sequences of the inverse PCR product and the BC-1 clone code for anNCKX2 cDNA with 148 base pairs of 5′-UTR, an open reading frame of 2009 base pairs, and a 3′-UTR of 6785 base pairs. The initiator methionine of the coding region falls within a sequence that fits the Kozak consensus (28Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) very well, tCCAagATGG (uppercase indicates matches), including the important −3 and +4 nucleotides. In addition, multiple stop codons are present in all three frames upstream from this methionine start codon. The tissue distribution of NCKX2 transcripts is shown in Fig. 1. The major transcript of 10.5 kilobase pairs was found to be abundantly expressed in all regions of the brain and also more weakly in eye, large intestine, and adrenal tissue. Another band, running at about 4.5 kilobase pairs, was also visible in heart, aorta, small and large intestine, and lung, although longer exposure times were required to see this species. Because we were able to amplify a PCR product corresponding to NCKX2 from heart RNA, the 4.5-kilobase pair band may correspond to a low abundance transcript polyadenylated at an upstream site. It is also possible, however, that transcripts visible in tissues outside of the brain may correspond to cross-reaction of theNCKX2 probe with larger amounts of related gene product(s). Note that a faint band (more evident in longer exposures, not shown) at about 6 kilobase pairs was present in RNA from eye, which corresponds to cross-reaction with the rat NCKX1 transcript. The location of NCKX2 transcripts in the brain was determined by in situ hybridization, as shown in Fig.2. Expression was restricted to neuronal cell bodies in almost all regions of the brain (29Carpenter M.B. Core Text of Neuroanatomy. 4th Ed. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1991Google Scholar, 30Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). In the neocortex, cells throughout layers II–VI were labeled, with particularly strong expression in layers VI and V. Hippocampal expression was strongest in the CA3 neurons, followed by CA1, then CA4, and then dentate gyrus neurons. Expression was robust throughout the striatum, with clearly observed regional patches of reduced intensity that may correspond to striosomes of the caudate nucleus. Expression was evident in all regions of the thalamus but was particularly strong in the medial geniculate body. In the cerebellum, strong expression was observed in stellate cells of the molecular layer, as well as in neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (not shown). Lower expression was also evident in the Purkinje neurons. In addition, expression was observed at high levels in entorhinal cortex, in many pontine nuclei, in the indusium griseum, and at lower levels in mitral and glomerular neurons of the olfactory bulb, and in subependymal neurons of the medial habenula (not shown). Of note, the septal nuclei were negative. The NCKX2 transcript encodes a protein with a predicted size of 74,651 Da and the sequence shown in Fig.3. Hydropathy analysis suggests 12 transmembrane segments resulting in a protein with a topology analogous to both NCX1 and NCKX1, as shown in Fig.4. Both a single consensus glycosylation site and a potential cleavage site for signal peptidase are present on the extracellular loop between M0 and M1, in positions analogous to the known sites of NCX1 (31Durkin J.T.

Acta. 1993; 1151: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, a sequence weakly resembling a calmodulin binding motif (33O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) is present at the beginning of the cytoplasmic loop following M5, analogous to the location of the XIP region of NCX1 (34Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Collins A. Hilgemann D.W. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Weiss J.N. Tomich J.M. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1014-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of NCKX2 transcripts from rat brain RNA by PCR has also revealed the presence of a slightly shorter species, apparently as a consequence of alternative splicing, which encodes a protein lacking a 17-amino acid stretch within the large cytoplasmic loop, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The location of several potential sites for modification by a variety of protein kinases is also illustrated in Fig. 3.Figure 4Hydropathy profile and model for the transmembrane topology of rat NCKX2. A hydropathy profile was generated with the TopPred II program using the Engelman, Steitz, and Goldman algorithm (19Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 586-685Google Scholar). The shaded regions with positive values correspond to the predicted transmembrane segments, shown ascylinders in the model below the graph. The hatched horizontal bars on the hydropathy plot indicate the regions with highest similarity to bovine NCKX1 (see Fig. 5).

We analyzed ACT synthesis in cultured human cortical astrocytes in response to various cytokines and growth factors. Oncostatin M (OSM) and interleukin (IL)-1β were potent stimulators of ACT mRNA expression, whereas tumor necrosis factor-α had modest activity, and IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were ineffective. The finding that OSM, but not LIF or IL-6, stimulated ACT expression suggests that human astrocytes express a “specific” OSM receptor, but not IL-6 or LIF receptors. However, cotreatment of human astrocytes with soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R)·IL-6 complex did result in potent stimulation of ACT expression. When the human ACT gene was cloned, two elements binding STAT1 and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) in response to OSM or IL-6·sIL-6R complexes could be identified and characterized. Taken together, these findings indicate that OSM or IL-6·sIL-6 complexes may regulate ACT expression in human astrocytes and thus directly or indirectly contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. α1-Antichymotrypsin (ACT) is an acute phase protein expressed in the brain which specifically colocalizes with amyloid-β during Alzheimer's disease.

Gordon A. Koj A. Koj Acute Phase Response to Injury and Infection. Elsevier, Amsterdam1985: 139-144Google Scholar, 2Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The expression of this proteinase inhibitor in hepatic cells is enhanced by interleukin (IL)-6 and glucocorticoids and to a lesser extent by IL-1 (3Baumann H. Richards C. Gauldie J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 4122-4128PubMed Google Scholar, 4Castell J.V. Gomez-Lechon M.J. David M. Andus T. Geiger T. Trullenque R. Gerok W. Heinrich P.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Although ACT is also found in the brain, the plasma-derived inhibitor is separated from this origin by a tight blood-brain barrier consisting of endothelial cells. For this reason it is believed that astrocytes are the likely source of ACT produced within the central nervous system (5Pasternack J.M. Abraham C.R. Van Dyke B.J. Potter H. Younkin S.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 827-834PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, ACT has been identified as one of the amyloid-associated proteins found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (6Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar, 7Abraham C.R. Selkoe D.J. Potter H. Cell. 1988; 52: 487-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The pathological feature of this disease is cerebral degeneration with neuronal cell death and deposition of abnormal proteins in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Because the expression of ACT is enhanced dramatically in affected brain regions in Alzheimer's disease, a state of cerebral “acute phase” in response to neuronal degradation has been proposed. IL-1 and IL-6, which are produced by cells of CNS, were suggested to induce ACT expression in astrocytes (8Vadenabeele P. Fiers W. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 217-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Indeed, the induction of ACT expression by IL-1 has been shown in human astrocyte cultures (9Das S. Potter H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 447-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); however, regulation by IL-6 has not been confirmed. To understand the control of ACT expression in the brain we used human astrocyte cultures and analyzed the pattern of its synthesis after stimulation with a variety of factors including IL-1 and cytokines of the IL-6 family. We have also cloned the 5′-flanking region of the ACT gene and performed analysis of its transcriptional activity. Our results suggest that at least one cytokine, oncostatin M (OSM), may play an important role in up-regulating ACT expression in astrocytes, whereas IL-6 requires the presence of soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). Cell Culture—Human cortical astrocyte cultures were established using dissociated human cerebral tissue at 16–20 weeks gestation. The protocol for obtaining postmortem fetal neural tissue complied with federal guidelines for fetal research and with the Uniformed Anatomical Gift Act. Cortical tissue was washed three times in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution and then dissociated by repeated pipetting. DNase (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml, and the solution was passed through a 100-μm nylon cell strainer (Falcon). The cells obtained were then centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g, resuspended in a trypsin/EDTA solution (0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution, Life Technologies, Inc.), and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Modified Eagle's medium containing 1% glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (MEM/FBS) and DNase (final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml) were added, and the cells were again pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in MEM/FBS. 1.6 × 108 cells were seeded in a T-150 tissue culture flask coated with polyethyleneimine. Cultures were maintained in an H2O-saturated incubator with an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The culture medium was changed 1 and 4 days after plating, and the cultures were then left undisturbed for at least 1 week. Astrocyte cultures were prepared by multiple passaging of the established mixed brain cell cultures. The cells from one T-150 flask were replated into three to five T-150 flasks. Just before confluence the cells were repassaged by trypsinization. This process was repeated until the cultures were >98% pure astrocytes as judged by immunocytochemistry analysis for glial fibrillary acidic protein (three to four passages). Human astrocytoma CCF-STTG1 cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, sodium pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids. Cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 (1.9 × 109 units/mg), 25 ng/ml OSM (4.7 × 107 units/mg), 5 ng/ml recombinant human IL-1 (1.2 × 108 units/mg) (all a gift from Immunex Corp., Seattle), 200 units/ml recombinant human interferon-γ (2.0 × 107 units/mg) (Boehringer), 25 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), 50 ng/ml sIL-6R (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), 10 ng/ml TNF-α (a gift of Cutter Laboratories Inc., Berkeley, CA), 10 units/ml recombinant human LIF (a gift of Dr. Heinz Baumann, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY), 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or 1 μm dexamethasone (both from Sigma). Actinomycin D (Sigma) was used at 5 μg/ml. OSM and sIL-6R in cerebrospinal fluid were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as recommended by the supplier (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Total RNA was prepared using the phenol extraction method (10Rose-John S. Dietrich A. Marks F. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Scherrer K. Darnell J.E.

Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The filters were prehybridized at 68 °C for 3 h in 10% dextran sulfate, 1m sodium chloride, and 1% SDS and hybridized in the same solution with a 1.4-kilobase EcoRI/EcoRI fragment of ACT cDNA (a gift of Dr. H. Rubin, University of Pennsylvania) labeled by random priming (13Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). After the hybridization, nonspecifically bound radioactivity was removed by washing in 2 × SSC at room temperature followed by two washes in 2 × SSC and 1% SDS at 68 °C for 20 min. The following oligonucleotides were used to obtain a −352 to +25 fragment of ACT promoter: 5′-TAGTCTAGAAATATACCAAAATGTTAG-3′ and 5′-GGTGGATCCAAAGCCGTCTGTCTGGAG-3′; primer 5′-ATCATCTAGACATTTCCAGTCCGA-3′ was synthesized to obtain a deletion mutant (−103 to +25). Mutants containing point mutations in the ACT-A and/or ACT-B elements were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the PWO polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and the following primers: 5′-GTATGAGCTCAAATTATCATCTGGT-3′, 5′-ATTTGAGCTCATACGGGCTTGTTAG-3′, 5′-CCAGGGTACCAACAGAACACTTGGT-3′, and 5′-TGTTGGTACCCTGGAAATGACCAGA-3′.

A 4517-base pair EcoRI/EcoRI fragment containing the 5′-flanking region of the ACT gene was cloned into pUC19 (pUCACT). Plasmid ptkCATΔEH is a derivative of pBLCAT2 (15Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Plasmids pACT-352CAT and pACT-103CAT were obtained by insertion of the XbaI/BamHI- orXbaI/XhoI-digested polymerase chain reaction products into the XbaI/BglII orXbaI/XhoI sites of ptkCATΔEH, respectively. Plasmids pACT-247CAT, pACT-156CAT, and pACT-68CAT were generated by insertion of MseI(blunt)/XhoI, BstNI(blunt)/XhoI, and BstNI(blunt)/XhoI fragments into theBamHI(blunt)/XhoI sites of ptkCATΔEH. Plasmid pACT-2431CAT was produced by inserting aPstI/PstI fragment from pUCACT into thePstI/PstI sites of pACT-352CAT, and plasmid pACT-1505CAT was formed by inserting a XbaI/XhoI fragment from pACT-2431CAT into the XbaI/XhoI sites of ptkCATΔEH. Plasmid pACT-1514CAT derives from pACT-2431CAT, from which the SphI/SphI fragment was deleted. Plasmid pACT-3573CAT was obtained by cloning theXbaI/XbaI fragment from pUCACT into theXbaI site of pACT-1505CAT. Plasmids pACTmutA-CAT, pACTmutB-CAT, and pACTmutAmutB-CAT analogous to pACT-156CAT but with introduced point mutations in the ACT-A and/or ACT-B elements were generated by insertion of XbaI/XhoI-digested polymerase chain reaction products into theXbaI/XhoI sites of ptkCATΔEH. Plasmids p6x(ACT-A)tkCAT, p6x(ACT-B)tkCAT, p3x(ACT-(A+B))tkCAT, and p(ACT-(A+B))tkCAT were obtained by insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide(s) with BglII ends into the BamHI site of ptkCATΔEH. All constructs were sequenced on both strands. Cells were transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum using calcium phosphate precipitates (16Mellon P.L.

Cells were incubated with precipitate for 6 h, washed twice, and media changed. One day after transfection, cells were stimulated and then cultured another 24 h and harvested. Protein extracts were prepared by freeze-thawing (17Gorman C. Glover D. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Sigma). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (18Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 19Seed B. Sheen J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). CAT activities were normalized to the internal control β-galactosidase activity and are the means ± S.E. of three to eight determinations. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (20Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahl W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 21Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lutticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA fragments were labeled by filling in 5′-protruding ends with Klenow enzyme using [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol). Gel retardation assays were carried out according to published procedures (22Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 23Sawadago M. van Dyke M.W. Gregor P.D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11985-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2–5 μg of nuclear extracts and approximately 10 fmol (10,000 cpm) of probe were used. The polyclonal anti-STAT3 (C20) and anti-STAT1 (E23) antisera were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). ACT is produced by human astrocytes with IL-1 having already been shown to induce its mRNA expression (9Das S. Potter H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 447-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We analyzed the pattern of ACT production in human astrocyte cultures in response to other factors regulating gene expression during inflammation and the acute phase response. Human astrocytes were stimulated with IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6, OSM, LIF, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, interferon-γ, and epidermal growth factor and analyzed by Northern blotting. An example of the results obtained is shown in Fig.1 A. In addition to IL-1, as reported previously, TNF-α and OSM were potent stimulators of ACT mRNA synthesis, and this was enhanced greatly by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Dexamethasone alone had only a small effect. In contrast, IL-6, LIF, epidermal growth factor, interferon-γ, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were ineffective (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). OSM was the most potent stimulator of ACT expression, not only in human astrocytes but also in the human astrocytoma cell lines U373 and CCF-STTG1 (data not shown). This finding correlates with the observation that OSM strongly activates ACT synthesis in bronchial epithelial cells (24Cichy J. Potempa J. Chawla R.K. Travis J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2729-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The OSM- or IL-1-induced ACT mRNA was very stable with a half-life of at least 12 h in human astrocytes (Fig. 1 B) as well as in the CCF-STTG1 cell line. To analyze the regulation of ACT transcription we cloned the ACT gene from a human genomic library. The 5′-region of the ACT gene is shown in Fig. 2 A. The 3.6-kilobase fragment containing the 5′-flanking region of the ACT gene was fused to the bacterial reporter gene coding for CAT, and the construct obtained was transiently transfected into astrocytes. CAT gene expression was induced in response to OSM (Fig. 2 B). Significantly, the same construct did not respond to IL-1 and TNF-α, suggesting that the elements conferring the response to these cytokines were not present in the 3.6-kilobase-long 5′-fragment of the ACT gene. The nature of these elements is not known, although activation of nuclear factor-κB has been correlated with the IL-1- and TNF-α induced transcription of the ACT gene in human astrocytoma cells (25Lieb K. Fiebich B.L. Schaller H. Berger M. Bauer J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2039-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The family of IL-6 type cytokines is characterized by the use of a common receptor subunit, the signal transducing protein gp130 (26Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling through gp130 results in the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of latent cytoplasmic proteins called STATs, particularly STAT1 and STAT3, followed by their dimerization, translocation to the nucleus, binding to specific elements within the promoters of target genes, and activation of transcription (26Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar, 28Lutticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pelegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Because the synthesis of ACT mRNA in astrocytes was induced by OSM but not by IL-6 (Figs.1 A and 2 B), and astrocytes were reported to produce IL-6 (29Benveniste J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1-C16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that these cells lack IL-6 receptors (IL-6R) on their cell surface. We analyzed the expression of IL-6R (gp80) in these cells by Northern blotting but could not detect any IL-6R mRNA, although it was easily detectable in HepG2 cells (data not shown). Next, to show that functional IL-6 receptors are missing from astrocytes, cells were stimulated with OSM, LIF, IL-6, or IL-6 together with sIL-6R. The IL-6·sIL-6R complexes have been shown previously to bind to gp130 and activate its signaling (26Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mackiewicz A. Schooltink H. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2021-2027PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of ACT expression was measured by Northern blotting, and activation of STAT proteins was examined by following their ability to bind to the high affinity sis-inducible element of human c-fos gene promoter (SIE) (31Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). OSM was found to activate STAT3 and STAT1 and induce ACT mRNA synthesis (Fig.3, A and B; see also Fig. 5 B). In contrast, IL-6 and LIF were incapable of inducing ACT mRNA synthesis or activating STAT factors. However, activation of STAT proteins and ACT expression was observed when sIL-6R was used together with IL-6, indicating that human astrocytes lack functional IL-6 receptors and most likely do not express LIF receptors. The IL-6·sIL-6 receptor cR complex strongly activated STAT3 but STAT1 activation could also be seen after longer exposure of a gel (data not shown). As a positive control astrocytoma cells were stimulated with IL-6, LIF, and OSM (Fig. 3 B, right panel). In these cells all three cytokines activated STAT3 (OSM also activated STAT1); however, a weak action of IL-6 and LIF suggested a small number of the corresponding surface receptors (Fig. 3 B, right panel). Furthermore, when astrocytes were transfected with the ACT-CAT construct the sIL-6R restored their responsiveness to IL-6 (Fig. 3 C).Figure 5Gel retardation assay of nuclear extracts from human astrocytes using fragments derived from ACT promoter. Panel A, human astrocytes were incubated with 25 ng/ml OSM for 15 min. 5 μg of nuclear protein was incubated with32P-labeled double-stranded fragments derived from the ACT promoter; ACT-A (A), ACT-B (B), ACT-(A+B) and SIE probes are shown. Binding was analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 3 B. Panel B, 5 μg of nuclear protein was incubated in the gel retardation assay mixture with the anti-STAT1 or anti-STAT3 antiserum for 30 min (1:400 dilution). Binding to the ACT-(A+B) or SIE elements was then analyzed by EMSA. The positions of SIE-A, SIE-B, and SIE-C are marked; asterisks indicate supershifted complexes. Panel C, binding to the ACT-(A+B) element was analyzed. A 100-fold excess of each of the following unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors was added to the binding reaction: rat serine proteinase inhibitor-3 STAT site (SPI-3 STAT), SIE, ACT-A (A), and ACT-B (B), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because both OSM and IL-6·sIL-6R greatly enhance ACT expression in astrocytes as well as activate transcription of the −3.6-kilobase ACT-CAT construct, a series of 5′-deletion mutants was made to identify the elements conferring this responsiveness. Constructs were transiently transfected into astrocytes, and their responsiveness to either OSM, dexamethasone, or OSM together with dexamethasone was assayed. The construct containing the −156 to +25 fragment of the ACT promoter and all of the longer constructs were fully responsive to OSM (or OSM with dexamethasone), whereas dexamethasone alone had no effect (Fig.4). However, the truncation to −103 resulted in a drastic loss of responsiveness to OSM by 80%. The responsiveness to OSM was abolished completely by further truncation to −68. The enhancing effect of dexamethasone (approximately 2-fold) was observed with all constructs, suggesting an activation of the transcriptional machinery rather than induction via a specific glucocorticoid receptor-responsive element. Because we could not detect any glucocorticoid receptor-responsive element within ACT promoter constructs, and the glucocorticoid receptor was recently shown to directly interact with the STAT5 protein (32Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), it is possible that the enhancing effect of dexamethasone is mediated by an interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with STATs. Two possible binding sites for STAT proteins were localized at the −125 to −117 (site A) and −95 to −87 (site B), and their function was assayed by gel retardation assays and point mutations. Nuclear extracts were prepared from human astrocytes treated with OSM and the binding of OSM-activated proteins analyzed using fragments containing both sites A and B together or each site separately. Fig.5 A shows that treatment with OSM resulted in the activation of proteins binding to both sites A and B when present together but only to site A if tested separately. These OSM-activated proteins, which bound to sites A and B, were identified as complexes of STAT1 and STAT3 using specific antibodies (Fig.5 B). Furthermore, the OSM-induced binding was competed for by the SIE or ACT-A oligonucleotides and partially by the serine proteinase inhibitor-3 STAT element but not by an ACT-B oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 C). The slowest migrating band observed with ACT-(A+B) oligonucleotide most likely contains STAT proteins simultaneously binding to both A and B elements. Thus, the STAT1 and STAT3 complexes do bind to sites ACT-A and ACT-B; however, site ACT-A binding is with high affinity, whereas site ACT-B is poorly recognized. To correlate binding of STAT1 and STAT3 complexes with the transcriptional activity of the ACT promoter, point mutations were introduced into the STAT binding sites. Mutations of both sites A and B had the same drastic effect on promoter activity, reducing the responsiveness by 80%, whereas the promoter with both mutated sites was no longer induced by OSM (Fig. 6). These results indicate that both sites contribute equally to the activation of ACT transcription by OSM. Finally, multiple copies of the identified STAT-binding elements were linked to a thymidine kinase (tk) promoter driving the transcription of the CAT gene, and transient transfections of human astrocytes were performed. The fragments containing site A or both sites (A and B) conferred responsiveness onto the thymidine kinase promoter, whereas site B alone was ineffective (Fig.7). Taken together these results show that two functional STAT binding elements mediate OSM-induced expression of the ACT gene in human astrocytes. The role of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6, within the CNS has been extensively studied over the last several years. Specifically, IL-1 and IL-6 have attracted much attention and have been suggested to mediate a cerebral acute phase response and induce the expression of cerebral acute phase proteins in astrocytes, including ACT (8Vadenabeele P. Fiers W. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 217-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-6, which is the major regulator of liver acute phase proteins, has also been suggested to participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (33Bauer J. Strauss S. Schreiter-Gasser U. Schlegel P. Witt I. Yolk B. Berger M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 34Strauss S. Bauer J. Ganter U. Jonas U. Berger M. Volk B. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 223-230PubMed Google Scholar). Our results, however, clearly show that IL-6 failed to activate STAT factors or to induce ACT expression in cultured human astrocytes (Fig. 3). The lack of response of these cells to IL-6 results from the absence of the α subunit of the IL-6R (gp80), because sIL-6R restored both activation of STAT proteins and induction of ACT expression (Fig. 3). Significantly, LIF, another IL-6 type cytokine, neither activated STAT proteins nor induced ACT expression in human astrocytes. We did not address specifically the question as to which of the components involved in LIF signaling was missing in astrocytes. However, considering that astrocytes produce both IL-6 and LIF (35Aloisi F. Rosa S. Testa U. Bonsi P. Russo G. Peschle C. Levi G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5022-5031PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lee S.C. Liu W. Dickson D.W. Brosnan C.F. Berman J.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2659-2667PubMed Google Scholar) we speculate that LIF-R is a likely candidate. Contrary to our present observations with human astrocytes, IL-6 has been reported to up-regulate nerve growth factor expression in mouse astrocytes (37Frei K. Malipiero U.V. Leist T.P. Zinkernagel R.M. Schwab M.E. Fontana A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the response of rat astrocytes to IL-6 in terms of STAT activation and regulation of gene expression. IL-6 activated STAT3 poorly in these cells and weakly induced the expression of the serine proteinase inhibitor-3 gene, a rat homolog of the ACT gene. As in human astrocytes, IL-6·sIL-6R complexes improved significantly both activation of STAT factors and induction of serine proteinase inhibitor-3 gene transcription in these cells. 2T. Kordula, M. Bugno, D. Bagarozzi, Jr., and J. Travis, unpublished observations. These results suggest that both sets of astrocytes express only small amounts of IL-6Rs or lack the presence of IL-6Rs on their cell surfaces. Also, human astrocytoma cells CCF-STTG1 and U373 barely respond to IL-6 (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Thus, IL-6 alone cannot trigger the activation of specific proteins, including ACT, in human astrocytes. In contrast to IL-6 and LIF, OSM emerges as a potent stimulator of ACT expression in astrocytes (Figs. 1 and 3). These three cytokines possess overlapping activities because of their signaling through receptors containing the shared signal transducer gp130 (26Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of IL-6 to the IL-6R results in the homodimerization of gp130, whereas LIF triggers heterodimerization of gp130 with LIF-R (26Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OSM can signal via two receptors: LIF-R·gp130 (also a receptor for LIF) and OSM-R·gp130 (specific OSM receptor) (26Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Murakami-Mori K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Nakamura S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Thoma B. Bird T.A. Friend D.J. Gearing D.P. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6215-6222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Because LIF failed to activate STAT proteins and induce the expression of ACT, we conclude that signaling via the LIF-R·gp130 system is not functional in human astrocytes. The response to OSM on the other hand is triggered through a specific OSM receptor composed of OSM-R and gp130. In contrast to human astrocytes, human astrocytoma cells CCF-STGG1, known to contain mRNA for gp130, LIF-R, and OSM-R (40Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), can respond to LIF (Fig. 2). Thus, these cells contain functional LIF receptors in addition to functional specific OSM receptors. It should be noted that the other well known example of signaling utilizing the specific OSM receptor but not the LIF-R·gp130 complex is the control of growth of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated Kaposi's sarcoma cells by OSM (38Murakami-Mori K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Nakamura S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, astrocytes, in parallel with Kaposi's sarcoma cells, express a specific OSM receptor that is being utilized to activate STAT proteins and induce expression of specific genes, including ACT. Recently, a specific OSM receptor has been shown to activate STAT5B efficiently (41Kuropatwinski K.K. De Imus C. Gearing D. Baumann H. Mosley B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15135-15144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 42Auguste P. Guillet C. Fourcin M. Olivier C. Veziers J. PouplardBarthelaix A. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15760-15764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); however, ACT expression is not up-regulated by STAT5B overexpression. 3H. Baumann, unpublished observations. The activation of ACT expression by IL-6·sIL-6R and OSM raises the question as to whether these factors can be found in the CNS. The expression of IL-6 by astrocytes, microglia, and also by astrocytoma cells is well documented (36Lee S.C. Liu W. Dickson D.W. Brosnan C.F. Berman J.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2659-2667PubMed Google Scholar, 43Cadman E.D. Witte D.G. Lee C.-M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 980-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-6 can be detected readily in cerebrospinal fluid of patients during viral and bacterial meningitis (37Frei K. Malipiero U.V. Leist T.P. Zinkernagel R.M. Schwab M.E. Fontana A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 44Waage A. Halstensen A. Shalaby R. Brandtzaeg P. Kierulf P. Espevik T. J. Exp.

Lett. 1995; 202: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), multiple sclerosis (47Merill J.E. J. Immunother. 1992; 12: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), after trauma (48Woodroofe M.N. Sarna G.S. Wadhwa M. Hayes G.M. Loughlin A.J. Tinker A. Cuzner M.L. J. Neuroimmunol. 1991; 33: 227-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), and in Alzheimer's disease (33Bauer J. Strauss S. Schreiter-Gasser U. Schlegel P. Witt I. Yolk B. Berger M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 34Strauss S. Bauer J. Ganter U. Jonas U. Berger M. Volk B. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 223-230PubMed Google Scholar, 49Huell M. Strauss S. Volk B. Berger M. Bauer J. Acta Neuropathol. 1995; 89: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The sIL-6R that is necessary for IL-6 action on human astrocytes was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of normal patients (1.6 ng/ml) (50Frieling J.T. Sauerwein R.W. Wijdenes J. Hendriks T. Van der Linden C.J. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and its level was elevated to 6.6 ng/ml in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with Crow-Fukase syndrome (51Atsumi T. Kato K. Kurosawa S. Abe M. Fujisaku A. Acta Haematol. 1995; 94: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We measured the levels of sIL-6R in the cerebrospinal fluid of both normal individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The amount of sIL-6R was not changed significantly in patients with Alzheimer's disease (0.8 ng/ml for both groups, n = 8). However, it is worth mentioning that the concentration of sIL-6R in the cerebrospinal fluid is approximately 1,000-fold higher than the concentration of IL-6. These results suggest that the level of sIL-6R in cerebrospinal fluid probably does not change during Alzheimer's disease; however, the amount of sIL-6R might still be elevated in certain regions of the brain (i.e.plaques). Clearly, the source of sIL-6R within the CNS needs to be defined. The amount of this receptor protein in plasma is much higher than in cerebrospinal fluid (77 ng/ml) (50Frieling J.T. Sauerwein R.W. Wijdenes J. Hendriks T. Van der Linden C.J. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) because blood-brain barriers prevent plasma proteins from entering the CNS. However, a blood-brain barrier breakdown has been shown to occur in response to overexpression of IL-6 in astrocytes (52Brett F.M. Mizisin A.P. Powell H.C. Campbell I.L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 53Campbell I.L. Abraham C.R. Masliah E. Kemper P. Inglis J.D. Oldstone M.B.A. Mucke L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10061-10065Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of IL-6 by reactive astrocytes might potentially result in diffusion of plasma proteins into the CNS (including sIL-6R and ACT). In the light of these findings the up-regulation of IL-6 could conceivably contribute indirectly to a cerebral acute phase response by enhancing the levels of sIL-6R in the CNS and the formation of functional IL-6·sIL-6R complexes. We could not detect OSM in the cerebrospinal fluid of either controls or patients with Alzheimer's disease using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (detection limit 2 pg/ml). However, plasma levels of OSM are also very low (below 20 pg/ml) (54Naemura J.R. Radka S.F. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar). This cytokine is produced by activated T-cells, and these cells readily migrate into the CNS (for review, see Ref. 55Owens T. Renno T. Taupin V. Krakowski M. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 566-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, human microglia can produce OSM and are also a likely source of this cytokine within the CNS. 4R. Rydel and E. F. Brigham, unpublished data. The activation of ACT transcription by OSM (or IL-6·sIL-6R) could be correlated with the binding of STAT3 and STAT1 complexes to two elements within the ACT promoter (Fig. 5). These elements bind STAT complexes with different affinities, although both contribute equally to the transcriptional activity of the ACT promoter (Fig. 6). In vitro, the distal site is bound with high affinity by STAT3 and STAT1, whereas the proximal site requires the presence of the distal element. Moreover, the distal site is a true enhancer capable of conferring responsiveness onto a heterologous promoter. The element containing both distal and proximal sites is qualitatively as good as the enhancer element containing only the high affinity distal site (Fig. 7). This observation indicates that the binding of STATs to promoter elements in vitro does not always correlate with the activation of transcription via STAT elements in vivo. Taken together these studies indicate that the increase of IL-6 alone cannot account for the enhanced ACT expression and that astrocytic responses to IL-6 require the formation of functional IL-6·sIL-6R complexes. Indeed, a role for OSM must now be considered because it is a potent stimulator of ACT expression in cultured human astrocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1970130833,"The pathway and kinetics of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) metabolism were measured in Xenopus laevis oocytes and cytoplasmic extracts of oocytes. Degradation of microinjected IP3 in intact oocytes was similar to that in the extracts containing comparable concentrations of IP3 ([IP3]). The rate and route of metabolism of IP3 depended on the [IP3] and the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]). At low [IP3] (100 nm) and high [Ca2+] (≥1 μm), IP3was metabolized predominantly by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase (3-kinase) with a half-life of 60 s. As the [IP3] was increased, inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5-phosphatase) degraded progressively more IP3. At a [IP3] of 8 μm or greater, the dephosphorylation of IP3 was the dominant mode of IP3 removal irrespective of the [Ca2+]. At low [IP3] and low [Ca2+] (both ≤400 nm), the activities of the 5-phosphatase and 3-kinase were comparable. The calculated range of action of IP3 in the oocyte was ∼300 μm suggesting that IP3 acts as a global messenger in oocytes. In contrast to IP3, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) was metabolized very slowly. The half-life of IP4 (100 nm) was 30 min and independent of the [Ca2+]. IP4 may act to sustain Ca2+ signals initiated by IP3. The half-life of both IP3 and IP4 in Xenopus oocytes was an order of magnitude or greater than that in small mammalian cells.

IP4 may act to sustain Ca2+ signals initiated by IP3. The half-life of both IP3 and IP4 in Xenopus oocytes was an order of magnitude or greater than that in small mammalian cells. Ca2+ signals regulate a diverse array of cellular functions including secretion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and gene transcription (1Berridge M.J.

Generation and degradation of the second messenger IP3, which opens the IP3receptor/Ca2+ channel on the endoplasmic reticulum, regulates the formation and termination of Ca2+ signals. Knowing the rates and pathways of IP3 degradation is fundamental to understanding Ca2+ wave formation. The metabolism of IP3 and its products by phosphatases and kinases is unfolding as an increasingly complex process (4Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev.

Several isoforms of the 5-phosphatase dephosphorylate IP3yielding inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (4Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev.

Current evidence suggests that the major function of the 5-phosphatase in the phosphoinositide cycle is to decrease the [IP3] and the concentration of IP4 ([IP4]). In contrast, the role of the 3-kinase is to generate another second messenger, IP4, as well as to decrease the [IP3]. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that IP4 is an important regulatory molecule in cells (6Irvine R.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Like IP3, IP4 may be involved in the regulation of the [Ca2+] (17Loomis-Husselbee J.W. Cullen P.J. Dreikausen U.E. Irvine R.F. Dawson A.P. Biochem.

IP4 binds to the IP3 receptor/Ca2+channel and releases Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum although with a 10-fold lower potency than IP3. More intriguing, IP4 binds with high affinity to several intracellular proteins, synaptotagmin I and II, Gap1, Btk, and centaurin-α (20Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R.

The pathway selected to metabolize IP3 may not only influence its rate of removal but also alter subsequent signal transduction within the cell. Much of our mechanistic knowledge of Ca2+ wave propagation is derived from studies of Ca2+ waves in oocytes and eggs of Xenopus laevis. Formation of the Ca2+ wave, which follows the fertilization of an egg and which follows the activation of plasma-membrane receptors in oocytes, requires IP3 (26Nuccitelli R. Yim D.L. Smart T. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 27Lechleiter J. Girard S. Peralta E. Clapham D. Science. 1991; 252: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Work to date on IP3 metabolism in Xenopus oocytes has yielded conflicting results. Microinjection of concentrated [3H]IP3 into single Xenopus oocytes followed by separation of the metabolites by ion-exchange chromatography has suggested that the 5-phosphatase pathway prevailed (28Shapira H. Lupu-Meiri M. Oron Y. J. Basic Clin. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1992; 3: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the addition of [3H]IP3 to a homogenate of oocytes or microinjection into ovarian follicles followed also by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation have provided strong evidence for the 3-kinase as the primary route of IP3 degradation (29McIntosh R.P. McIntosh J.E.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 30McIntosh R.P. McIntosh J.E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These discrepancies remain unresolved, despite the central role that the Xenopus oocyte has played in understanding Ca2+ wave propagation. All three of the studies discussed above found a surprisingly prolonged degradation time for IP3, 20 min or longer. This contrasts with smaller cells that degrade IP3 in a few seconds (31Wang S.S. Alousi A.A. Thompson S.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 149-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Burgess G.M. McKinney J.S. Irvine R.F. Putney J.W. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Establishing both the rate and pathway of IP3 metabolism in oocytes is required to understand the role of the phosphoinositide pathway in the generation and termination of Ca2+ signals and in interactions with other signal transduction cascades. The purpose of this investigation was to determine how IP3 and IP4 were degraded in X. laevis oocytes. Moreover, the goal was to quantitate the kinetic properties of these metabolic pathways in the cytoplasmic milieu. Tritiated inositol and inositol phosphates were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Nonradioactive IP3 was purchased from Calbiochem and Alexis (Woburn, MA), and nonradioactive IP4 and calpain inhibitor I (N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) were purchased from Calbiochem. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was supplied by Alexis (Woburn, MA). EGTA “puriss” grade, was obtained from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY). Rhod-2, BAPTA, and calcium green-5N were supplied by Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were purchased from Fisher. An equimolar solution of EGTA and Ca2+ was prepared by the method of Tsien and Pozzan (33Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts with varying [Ca2+] were made by addition of 10 mm EGTA and 10 mm EGTA with 10 mm Ca2+. The [Ca2+] in the EGTA-buffered extracts was estimated from the [Ca2+] in buffer A (135 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) which approximated the intracellular ionic environment and contained the same mixture of 10 mmEGTA and 10 mm EGTA with 10 mm Ca2+as the EGTA-buffered extract. The [Ca2+] in the buffer solution was measured using the fluorescent Ca2+indicators, rhod-2 and calcium green-5N as described by Allbritton and colleagues (34Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) and Haugland (35Haugland R. Spence M.T.Z. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1996: 511-518Google Scholar). The [Ca2+] in buffer A containing 10 mm EGTA and 10 mmCa2+ was 10 μm. FemaleX. laevis frogs were purchased from Nasco (Modesto, CA). Oocytes were surgically obtained and prepared as described previously (34Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 36Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7243-7247Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts were also made as described previously with the following exceptions (34Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 37Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). To minimize proteolysis the oocytes and extract were maintained at 4 °C throughout the preparation. Calpain inhibitor I (10 μg/ml) was added to the extract to block the Ca2+-activated protease calpain. After isolation, the cytoplasmic extract was used immediately in experiments. Prolonged delays prior to use diminished the ability of the extract to metabolize inositol phosphates. This cytoplasmic preparation is ∼90% pure cytoplasm (90 mg/ml protein) (34Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Oocytes were microinjected with 5–30 nl of [3H]IP3 (2 μm) contained in buffer A with or without BAPTA (100 mm). The volume of injectate was determined from the total number of counts contained in the oocyte. The oocytes were incubated at room temperature for the indicated times. Just prior (∼10 s) to the end of the incubation period, the buffer solution surrounding the oocyte was removed to determine how much of the tritium label had leaked from the oocyte. Cells that leaked greater than 10% of the radioactive label were excluded from experiments. The intracellular reactions of the oocyte were terminated by rapid freezing with powdered dry ice. The frozen oocyte was then homogenized in chloroform:methanol (50 μl of 1:2) and buffer B (50 μl of 25 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 3.5) with 80 μg of hydrolyzed phytic acid added as a carrier to prevent nonspecific loss of inositol phosphates. Hydrolyzed phytic acid was prepared as described by Irvine and colleagues (38Wreggett K.A. Howe L.R. Moore J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 933-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After addition of chloroform (50 μl), the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g, and the aqueous phase was separated by reverse phase HPLC. [Ca2+] in the cytosol was buffered at the indicated concentration by addition of 10 mm EGTA and 10 mm EGTA with 10 mm Ca2+. In some instances, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) was included in the cytoplasmic mixture. [3H]IP3 or [3H]IP4 was then added to the oocyte cytosol. After the addition of each reagent to the cytosolic extract, it was gently mixed over a 5-s period by pipetting the mixture up and down. The cytoplasmic extract was incubated for the indicated time at room temperature (∼20 °C). The reaction was stopped with a 16-fold excess volume of trifluoroacetic acid (10%) containing hydrolyzed phytic acid (0.8 mg/ml) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was dried, resuspended in buffer B, and separated by reverse phase HPLC. Inositol phosphates were separated on an analytical C18 column (Alltech, San Jose, CA) maintained at 45 °C with an elution protocol modified from that of Shayman and Bement (39Shayman J.A. Bement D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and Sulpice et al. (40Sulpice J.C. Bachelot C. Gascard P. Giraud F. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press, New York1990: 45-63Google Scholar). The flow rate was 1 ml/min. During the first 22 min, fractions were collected every 0.25 min and thereafter every 1.25 min. To monitor the separation efficiency of the column, a set of standards previously added to and then extracted from cytosol was chromatographed each day. [3H]Inositol coeluted with inositol 1-phosphate as did the other isomers of inositol phosphate. The isomers of inositol bisphosphate were not distinguishable. To qualitatively determine the rate of IP3 metabolismin vivo, stage V/VI oocytes were microinjected with [3H]IP3 (2 μm) (n = 11). After incubation for 30 s, 1 min, or 5 min, the oocytes were rapidly frozen to terminate intracellular reactions. The inositol phosphates were extracted from the cytoplasm and separated by HPLC. Representative standard and experimental traces are shown in Fig. 1, A–C. Oocytes microinjected with small volumes of [3H]IP3 metabolized half of the [3H]IP3 in approximately 1 min (Fig.1 B). Longer times were required to degrade half of the [3H]IP3 when larger volumes were microinjected (Fig. 1 C). In all of the experiments, the metabolic fraction that contained the most tritium was that of IP4 or IP3. In vivo and at an [IP3] of 2 μm and lower, IP3was metabolized predominantly by the 3-kinase. In other species the activity of the 3-kinase is increased by the binding of calmodulin and Ca2+ (11Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Biden T.J. Peter-Riesch B. Schlegel W. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol.

Downes C.P. Hardin T.K. Mitchell R.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine whether [Ca2+] regulated the metabolism of IP3 in Xenopus oocytes, [3H]IP3 (2 μm) was coinjected with BAPTA (100 mm) (n = 10) to diminish the IP3-mediated increase in [Ca2+]. After a 1-, 5-, 15-, or 30-min incubation time, the inositol phosphates were extracted and separated. Remarkably, very little of the [3H]IP3 was metabolized by 5 min (Fig.1 D). The half-life of the microinjected IP3 was ∼13 min. In contrast to the oocytes without BAPTA, substantial amounts of tritium did not accumulate in the IP4 fraction (Fig. 1, D and E). The activity of the 3-kinase was dramatically decreased in the oocytes containing BAPTA presumably due to a decrease in [Ca2+]. In these in vivoexperiments, both diffusion and degradation altered [IP3] during the time course of the measurements. One minute after microinjection in the absence of degradation, the [IP3] at the microinjection site would still be 10 times greater than the final equilibrium concentration (41Crank J. The Mathematics of Diffusion. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989: 29Google Scholar). Since [IP3] was also altered by diffusion, these experiments could not be used to measure quantitatively the rates and pathways of IP3metabolism. To provide a quantitative description of the metabolism of IP3, subsequent experiments were performed in a cytosolic extract. In past experiments, cytosolic preparations were greatly diluted during preparation, and the compartmentalization of proteins and membranes was abolished by homogenization (29McIntosh R.P. McIntosh J.E.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 30McIntosh R.P. McIntosh J.E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To eliminate these disadvantages, we used a cytosolic extract that is ∼90% of the concentration of undiluted cytoplasm (34Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). The cytosol contains nearly all of the intracellular organelles, and they retain many of their normal functions including the ability to transit through the cell cycle (34Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 37Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 42Newmeyer D.D. Wilson K.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that this extract could be used to define how [IP3] and [Ca2+] regulate the removal of IP3 in an environment similar to the cytoplasmic milieu. [3H]IP3 (100 nm) was added to a cytoplasmic extract that contained 10 mm EGTA with 10 mm Ca2+ ([Ca2+] ∼10 μm). At varying times an aliquot of this cytosolic mixture was removed, and the inositol phosphates were extracted and chromatographed. The half-life of the [3H]IP3was 60 s (Fig. 2 B). Under these conditions most of the [3H]IP3 was converted to IP4. The half-life of IP4 was considerably longer than that of IP3. For incubation times of 5 min or less, the metabolism of IP4 was negligible (see also Fig. 4). By 10 min much of the tritium (∼30–40%) initially added to the cytosol was no longer soluble after acid extraction; the [3H]inositol was recycled into a cellular component other than inositol or an inositol phosphate. These results are consistent with those obtained in the intact oocytes microinjected with [3H]IP3 suggesting that the cytosolic extract is a very good model for the intact oocyte.Figure 4Metabolism of IP4 by cytoplasmic extracts of oocytes. [3H]IP4 (10 μm) was added to a cytoplasmic extract which was then incubated for varying times. The inositol phosphates were isolated and quantitated. The concentrations of IP≤2 (▴, ▵), IP4 (•, ○), and I-1,3,4-P3 (▪, □) are plotted against the incubation time. [Ca2+] in the extract was buffered to 10 μm (▵, ○, □) or to less than 100 nm (▴, •, ▪). The lines through the IP4 and IP≤2 data points are fits to an exponential function, and the line through the I-1,3,4-P3 data points is hand drawn.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For experimental time points of 5 min or less, the cytosolic reactions of IP3 could be segregated into two distinct pathways without common metabolites (Fig. 2 A). In the 3-kinase pathway, IP4 accumulated with very little conversion of IP4 to the lower inositol phosphates. Consequently, [IP4] was used as an estimate of the activity of the 3-kinase for time points of 5 min or less. Inositol bisphosphate (IP2) was then formed almost exclusively by dephosphorylation of IP3 rather than by dephosphorylation of I-1,3,4-P3. Inositol and inositol monophosphate (IP1) were formed by subsequent dephosphorylation of that IP2. The products of the 5-phosphatase pathway were inositol, IP1, and IP2, and the sum of the concentrations of these three inositols ([IP≤2]) was used to estimate the activity of the 5-phosphatase toward IP3. For times less than 5 min, neither inositol, IP1, nor IP2 accrued to a substantial degree (Fig. 2 B). Neither of these inositol fractions exceeded 10% of the total tritium in the cytosol. The metabolite of IP4, I-1,3,4-P3, did not accumulate either. The chromatographic peak representing this isomer never contained more than 6% of the added tritium. Although both the 3-kinase and 5-phosphatase were active in the extract, the conversion of IP3 to IP4dominated at these low [IP3] and for incubation times less than 5 min. Since the activity of the 5-phosphatase was much lower than that of the 3-kinase, the kinetic properties of the 3-kinase were estimated from the rate of formation of IP4. The kinetics of this reaction appeared first order; the rate of formation of IP4 was proportional to [IP3] (43Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley and Sons, New York1975: 225-229Google Scholar). The first order rate constant (k) obtained by fitting the [IP4] versus time trace to an exponential was 10−2 s−1. Since the prior in vivo experiments suggested that [Ca2+] regulated the metabolism of IP3 in oocytes, [3H]IP3 (100 nm) was added to a cytoplasmic extract which contained 10 mm EGTA decreasing [Ca2+] to less than 100 nm (Fig.2 C). Since the half-life of IP4 remained much greater than 5 min (see also Fig. 4), the data were displayed identically to that in Fig. 2 B. At low [Ca2+] the half-life of IP3 was increased markedly to 10 min. In agreement with the in vivo results, the longer half-life was due to a decrease in the activity of the 3-kinase. Less than 7 and 25% of the IP3 was converted to IP4 in 1 and 10 min, respectively. As before, I-1,3,4-P3 did not accumulate. The rate of accrual of IP4 and IP≤2 was similar and linear over time (0.04 nm/s) and nearly identical to the rate of accumulation of IP≤2 in the presence of high [Ca2+] (Fig. 2, B and C). Formation of IP≤2 was independent of [Ca2+] suggesting that the 5-phosphatase of Xenopus oocytes was not regulated by [Ca2+]. The unchanged production of [IP≤2], despite a markedly decreased [IP4], also suggests that the lower inositol phosphates resulted predominantly from sequential dephosphorylation of IP3 rather than IP4. To determine the range of [Ca2+] that potentiated the 3-kinase's activity, we varied the [Ca2+] in the extract by altering the ratio of 10 mm EGTA to 10 mmEGTA with 10 mm Ca2+. After addition of [3H]IP3 (100 nm) to the cytosolic preparation for 1 min, the inositol phosphates were extracted and chromatographed. As the [Ca2+] was increased from <100 nm to >2 μm, the amount of IP3degraded increased from 7 to 40 nm. Half-maximal activation of the 3-kinase occurred at a [Ca2+] of 390 nm and maximal activation appeared by 1 μm(Fig. 2 D). Several previous reports indicated that the 5-phosphatase was activated after phosphorylation by protein kinase C, whereas other experiments suggested that the 5-phosphatase activity was inactivated by protein kinase C (44Biden T.J.

Addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml), a potent activator of protein kinase C, to cytosolic extracts with varying [Ca2+] did not alter the rate or pathway of IP3 metabolism (data not shown). Under these conditions, activation of protein kinase C did not alter the dephosphorylation of IP3 by the 5-phosphatase or phosphorylation of IP3 by the 3-kinase. The Michaelis constant (Km) of the 5-phosphatase for IP3 is greater than 10 times that of the 3-kinase in many different tissues (4Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 5Shears S.B. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 63-92PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the metabolic pathway of IP3 may depend on [IP3]. To determine how the route of degradation in Xenopus oocytes changed with [IP3], we varied the starting [IP3] in the cytosolic preparation from 100 nm to 30 μm. [3H]IP3 was incubated in the extract for 5 min followed by extraction and separation of the inositol phosphates. In the first series of experiments, [Ca2+] was maintained at 10 μm by addition of 10 mm EGTA with 10 mm Ca2+. For a starting [IP3] of less than 8 μm, the major metabolic pathway was conversion to IP4 by the 3-kinase (Fig.3 A). At an initial [IP3] of approximately 2 μm and greater, the rate of formation of IP4 was independent of [IP3] consistent with [IP3] being much greater than the Km of the 3-kinase. The rate of generation of IP4 at this high [IP3] was used to estimate the maximal velocity (Vmax) of the 3-kinase for IP3 (4 nm/s). For a starting [IP3] greater than 8 μm, [IP≤2] continued to increase despite a plateau in the generation of IP4 (Fig. 3 A). The additional IP≤2 must originate from dephosphorylation of IP3 by the 5-phosphatase. At high [IP3], most of the IP≤2 was formed by dephosphorylation of IP3 rather than IP4; IP3 was degraded chiefly by the 5-phosphatase. To determine how a decrease in [Ca2+] altered IP3 metabolism at different [IP3], the initial [IP3] was varied from 100 nm to 30 μm in a cytosolic preparation containing 10 mm EGTA (Fig. 3 B). The [3H]IP3 was incubated in the extract for 5 min followed by acid extraction and chromatographic separ"

CAP contains a unique structure, with three adjacent Src homology-3 (SH3) domains in the COOH terminus and a region sharing significant sequence similarity with the peptide hormone sorbin. Expression of CAP in NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the insulin receptor induced the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. This effect of CAP expression on the organization of the actin-based cytoskeleton was independent of the type of integrin receptors engaged with extracellular matrix, whereas membrane ruffling and decreased actin stress fibers induced by insulin were not affected by expression of CAP. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that CAP colocalized with actin stress fibers. Moreover, CAP interacted with the focal adhesion kinase, p125FAK, both in vitro and in vivo through one of the SH3 domains of CAP. The increased formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in CAP-expressing cells was correlated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in growing cells or upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion. These results suggest that CAP may mediate signals for the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. c-Cbl-associated protein, CAP, was originally cloned from a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA expression library using full-length c-Cbl as a bait.

We reported recently that insulin markedly stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-Cbl proto-oncogene product in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but not in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts or in any other cell lines expressing high levels of functional insulin receptors and c-Cbl (16Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To explore this specificity, c-Cbl was used as a bait in search for adipose-specific signaling proteins. We isolated a novel protein that we termed CAP for c-Cbl-associatedprotein. CAP contains a unique structure with three adjacent SH3 domains in the COOH terminus and a region sharing significant sequence similarity with the porcine peptide hormone sorbin, termed the sorbin homology domain (17Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 18Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both CAP mRNA and proteins were expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not in 3T3-L1 or NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. CAP interacts with c-Cbl and Sos in living cells via the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of CAP. Furthermore, one major CAP isoform associated with the insulin receptor, and insulin stimulation resulted in the dissociation of CAP from the insulin receptor (18Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Here, we report that ectopic expression of one form of CAP cDNA in NIH-3T3 cells resulted in increased stress fibers and focal adhesion formation. These morphological changes correlate with reduction of adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase, p125FAK. Our results suggest that CAP may play an important role in protein-protein associations involved in cell architecture changes. Anti-CAP antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with a GST fusion protein containing the three SH3 domains expressed in bacterial cells (GST-CAP-SH3), and purified by chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The resulting antiserum was affinity-purified using purified CAP-SH3 protein. This was prepared by cleavage of the GST-CAP-SH3 fusion protein with factor Xa (New England Biolabs), followed by coupling to AminoLink column (Pierce). Anti-p125FAK antibodies, A-17 and C-903, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-paxillin, anti-p130CAS, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies RC20H were from Transduction Laboratories. Protein G/protein A-agarose was from Oncogene Science. Anti-Flag antibodies were purchased from Eastman Kodak. Anti-vinculin antibodies were from Sigma. Oregon Green™-labeled goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were from Amersham Corp. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing the human insulin receptor (106receptors/cell, NIH-3T3-IR) were obtained from Dr. C. C. Mastick (Department of Cell Biology, Parke-Davis) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 75 units/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). For cell adhesion experiments, cells were detached from tissue culture dishes by limited trypsin/EDTA treatment, followed by two rinses with Ca/Mg-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then with DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cell suspensions were incubated in DMEM, 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 30 min, then plated onto dishes coated with fibronectin (20 μg/ml), and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. For calculating cell growth rate, the cell lines were seeded in six-well culture plates at a density of 5 × 104cells/well and maintained in a medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The culture medium was changed every day. Every 24 h, cells from individual wells were removed by incubation with trypsin and counted (in triplicate) in a Coulter counter. A Flag epitope-tagged full-length CAP cDNA in the pBabe retroviral vector (19Morgenstern P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) was constructed as follows. The cDNA of the amino-terminal region of CAP was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with CAP cDNA in pEXlox as the template (17Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The primer 5′-CGCGGATCCGCCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGAGTTCTGAATGTGAT-3′ was designed to have a BamHI restriction site, followed by a coding sequence for a Flag epitope in frame with amino acid 2 and the primer 5′-AATGTCTGGAGTCGG-3′ corresponding to amino acids 345–350. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and SacI (present in the CAP gene), and ligated into the largest CAP cDNA clone, isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screen, in pGAD-GH vector digested with BamHI and SacI. The Flag-tagged full-length CAP cDNA was then liberated by digestion with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into the pBabe vector at the same sites. The sequence of the Flag-tagged CAP cDNA (Flag-CAP) in this vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing. NIH-3T3-IR cells were infected with pBabe-Flag-CAP, and stable clones were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). NIH-3T3-IR cells expressing CAP (NIH-3T3-IR-CAP) or NIH-3T3-IR cells expressing the vector alone were grown on glass Lab-Tex chamber slides (Nunc Inc.), or slides coated with fibronectin (20 μg/ml) or laminin (50 μg/ml). The cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS and treated with 25 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min to quench free aldehyde groups. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, and incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5% dry milk, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl. Affinity-purified anti-CAP (1 μg/ml), anti-Flag (10 μg/ml), or anti-vinculin (1:400 dilution) antibodies were applied in blocking buffer for 2 h, followed by incubation with Oregon Green™-labeled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse (2 μg/ml) antibodies for 1 h. For actin localization, the cells were stained with 0.1 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) for 30 min. For insulin stimulation, serum-starved cells were removed by trypsin treatment and washed as described for the cell adhesion experiments, plated on fibronectin-coated Lab-Tex chamber slides for 3 h at 37 °C, and then stimulated with insulin (100 nm) at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were viewed on a Zeiss 135 Axiovert microscope. Fluorescence photographs were taken on Kodak 400 ASA film and digitally processed using Adobe Photoshop. In all cases, images presented here are representative of at least three separate experiments. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mmNaF, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, protein concentrations in the clarified supernatants were determined by the Bio-Rad method. Equal protein amounts were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G/protein A-agarose for 2 h, and washed extensively with lysis buffer before solubilization in Laemmli sample buffer. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Individual proteins were detected with the specified antibodies and visualized by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. To reprobe immunoblots, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated for 30 min at 60 °C with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), containing 2% SDS and 0.7% 2-mercaptoethanol and then washed extensively with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. The DNA fragments encoding the individual SH3 domains of CAP were generated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted in frame between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the GST expression vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. In vitro association experiments were performed with equal amounts (5 μg) of the immobilized GST fusion proteins as described previously (20Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7875-7880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were analyzed as described above for immunoprecipitates. Full-length c-Cbl was used as a target protein to screen a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system. Multiple, independent cDNA inserts that were cloned from this library encoded a novel protein, designated as CAP for c-cbl-associatedprotein (18Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of these clones revealed three adjacent SH3 domains in the carboxyl terminus and distinct sequences in the NH2 terminus, sharing significant sequence similarity with the peptide hormone sorbin, that we have termed the sorbin homology domain (Fig.1 A). The structure of CAP suggests that it may participate in multiple signaling cascades. DNA sequencing of the isolated cDNAs and Northern blot analysis indicated that there are multiple splice variants of CAP that may result in multiple isoforms with distinct biological functions. Both CAP mRNA and proteins are expressed predominately in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and not in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (18Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To explore the function of CAP, a retroviral-based gene transfer system was used for stable expression of one isoform of CAP in NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (NIH-3T3-IR). To follow expression of the exogenous CAP molecule, it was Flag epitope-tagged at its NH2 terminus (Flag-CAP). Puromycin-resistant clones were isolated, and two representative clones that express comparable amounts of Flag-CAP (NIH-3T3-IR-CAP2 and NIH-3T3-IR-CAP8) are depicted in Fig.1. Anti-CAP antibodies detected a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 88 kDa in lysates prepared from NIH-3T3-IR-CAP2 or NIH-3T3-IR-CAP8 cells, but not from NIH-3T3-IR cells (Fig.1 B). Similar results were obtained when lysates prepared from NIH-3T3-IR-CAP2 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-CAP antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-Flag antibodies (Fig.1 C). The NH2-terminal Flag-tagged CAP was recognized by both the anti-Flag antibodies and an anti-CAP serum raised against the COOH-terminal domain of CAP. Both antibodies detected CAP only in whole cell lysates prepared from the CAP-infected NIH-3T3-IR cells and not in cells infected with the vector alone. NIH-3T3-IR cells express no detectable endogenous proteins recognized by the anti-CAP antibodies. The molecular mobility of CAP is consistent with the molecular mass of the isoform predicted from the cDNA. During construction of the cell lines for stable expression, we observed that the growth rate of the cells expressing Flag-CAP was slower than that observed for NIH-3T3-IR cells. As shown in Fig.1 D, both cell lines expressing CAP exhibit a growth rate approximately one-third that of the parental NIH-3T3-IR cells. In addition to a slower growth rate, CAP-expressing cells exhibited marked differences in size and shape compared with their parental cells. Analysis of the actin-based cytoskeleton of NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells by phalloidin staining revealed that CAP expression induced a dramatic increase in the number and density of F-actin stress fibers along both axes of cells (Fig.2 A). Staining with antibodies against vinculin, a major component of focal adhesions (21Craig S.W. Johnson P.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), showed that CAP expression increased the number of elongated, arrowhead-shaped vinculin-containing complexes linked to the longitudinal stress fibers, indicating the formation of focal adhesions (Fig. 2 A′). In contrast, NIH-3T3-IR cells grown under the same conditions had few organized actin filaments and little if any focal adhesions (Fig. 2, D and D′). Thus, the increased content of F-actin stress fibers correlates with an increased formation of adhesion complexes, suggesting that CAP may modulate signaling events associated with integrin-mediated adhesion. Since the cytoskeletal structure of cells is dynamically regulated by extracellular matrix in contact with the cell surface (22Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar, 23Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), we analyzed the cell shape and organization of the cytoskeleton in cells grown on a fibronectin coated surface (Fig. 2, B and B′). NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells grown on fibronectin contained a dense array of organized actin fibers, accompanied by an assembly of focal adhesions. As a consequence, the overall size of the cells bound to fibronectin was enlarged compared with NIH-3T3-IR cells grown on fibronectin (Fig. 2, E and E′). Similar phalloidin and vinculin staining patterns were observed when NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells were plated on laminin (Fig. 2, C and C′). Interestingly, less actin organization and fewer focal adhesions were observed in NIH-3T3-IR cells plated on laminin than on fibronectin (Fig. 2, F and F′), suggesting a different integrin-mediated cytoskeleton reorganization in NIH-3T3-IR cells (24Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8937) Google Scholar). We next studied whether the CAP-induced changes in the actin-based cytoskeleton could modulate the response of these cells to insulin. Previous studies have shown that insulin produced stress fiber breakdown and membrane ruffling in various cell types (25Ridely A.G. Paterson H.F. Johnson C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar, 26Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Kenta H. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Calas B. Grigorescu F.

Serum-starved NIH-3T3-IR-CAP or NIH-3T3-IR cells were plated on a fibronectin-coated surface and were either left untreated (Control), or stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 15 min. Treatment with insulin of NIH-3T3-IR-CAP or NIH-3T3-IR cells markedly reduced the number and length of actin stress fibers as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3). Additionally, insulin treatment of both cell lines resulted in increased membrane ruffling around the cell margins, consistent with earlier observations (Fig. 3, B and D, and Refs.25Ridely A.G. Paterson H.F. Johnson C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar and 26Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Kenta H. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H.

To correlate the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in NIH-3T3 cells expressing CAP with its subcellular localization, immunofluorescence labeling of NIH-3T3-IR or NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells was carried out using affinity-purified anti-CAP antibodies. A modest, nonspecific staining was observed when 3T3-NIH-IR cells were incubated with anti-CAP antibodies (Fig.4 A, NIH-3T3-IR, Anti-CAP). Immunofluorescence of NIH-3T3-IR cells expressing Flag-tagged CAP with anti-CAP antibodies showed distinct, arrowhead-shaped structures (Fig. 4 A, NIH-3T3-IR-CAP, Anti-CAP). Dual labeling with phalloidin (Fig. 4 A, NIH-3T3-IR-CAP, Actin) and superimposition of anti-CAP and actin images revealed an overlap between the staining patterns observed with anti-CAP antibodies and the actin stress fibers (Fig. 4 A, NIH-3T3-IR-CAP, Anti-CAP/Actin). These results suggest the colocalization of CAP with actin stress fibers. The specificity of the staining pattern observed with the anti-CAP antibodies was confirmed by incubation of NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells with anti-Flag antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4 B, immunostaining with anti-Flag antibodies resulted in the colocalization of CAP with actin stress fibers similar to the observation with anti-CAP antibodies. The results described above provide a functional linkage between CAP expression and cytoskeletal rearrangements. The presence of three divergent domains in CAP (Fig. 1 A) suggests that some of the biological roles of CAP may arise from interactions of the SH3 domains with proteins that are involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. One candidate is the focal adhesion kinase, p125FAK, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase that contains proline-rich motifs in the COOH terminus (28Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cob B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 29Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). To determine whether CAP may associate with p125FAK, each of the individual SH3 domains of CAP were expressed as GST fusion proteins. These GST fusion proteins were incubated with lysates prepared from NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells, and the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p125FAK antibodies. As Shown in Fig.5 A, the middle SH3 domain of CAP (SH3B, Fig. 1 A) most efficiently bound p125FAK, whereas modest binding was detected for the NH2-terminal (SH3A) and the carboxyl-terminal (SH3C) SH3 domains. Interestingly, the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of CAP (SH3C) was able to bind c-Cbl and Sos in cell lysates (18Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To gain further insight regarding the functional importance of CAP and p125FAK association, we examined whether these proteins interact in intact cells. Lysates prepared from NIH-3T3-IR-CAP or NIH-3T3-IR cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-p125FAK antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-CAP antibodies (Fig. 5 B). CAP was readily coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous p125FAK in NIH-3T3-IR-CAP but not in NIH-3T3-IR cells, indicating that CAP and p125FAK form stable complexes in intact cells, possibly through the SH3 domains of CAP. Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins involved in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and interactions are critical events in integrin-mediated signal transduction (22Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar, 30Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The association of CAP with p125FAK prompted us to examine the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p125FAK in growing NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells. Equal protein amounts from NIH-3T3-IR-CAP or 3T3-NIH-IR cell lysates were incubated with anti-p125FAK antibodies. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6 A (Anti-pY Blot), p125FAK is prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated in attached, growing NIH-3T3-IR cells (30Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells is only a fraction of that observed in NIH-3T3-IR cells. Reprobing of the membrane with anti-p125FAK antibodies showed that CAP did not affected the expression levels of p125FAK (Fig. 6 A, Anti-p125FAK Blot). The tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK is increased by integrin-mediated cell adhesion (28Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cob B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 30Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). To analyze the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells following integrin receptor activation, NIH-3T3-IR-CAP and NIH-3T3-IR cells were either kept in suspension or plated on dishes coated with fibronectin for 30 min. Cell lysates prepared from suspended or adherent cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-p125FAK antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.6 B, Anti-pY Blot). p125FAK immunoprecipitated from suspended NIH-3T3-IR-CAP or NIH-3T3-IR cells contained little if any phosphotyrosine. Replating of 3T3-NIH-IR cells on fibronectin resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK, as reported previously (28Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cob B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 30Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In contrast, p125FAK immunoprecipitated from NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells plated on fibronectin contained significantly reduced levels of tyrosine phosphorylation compared with levels detected in NIH-3T3-IR cells under the same conditions. To confirm that p125FAK was precipitated equally from all samples, the blot was completely stripped of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and reprobed with anti-p125FAK antibodies (Fig. 6 B, Anti-p125FAK Blot). Equal amounts of p125FAK were precipitated from all samples. These results indicate that the lower basal tyrosine phosphorylation state of p125FAK in CAP-expressing cells is due in part to an impaired adhesion-mediated p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. The tyrosine phosphorylation of p130CAS and paxillin has also been shown to coincide with cell adhesion (32Burridge K. Turner C.E. Homer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 111: 893-903Crossref Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 33Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We examined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of p130CAS and paxillin in NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells upon adhesion to fibronectin (Fig.6 C). Samples from suspended or adherent cells prepared as described in panel B were immunoprecipitated with anti-p130CAS or anti-paxillin antibodies and phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 6 C, Anti-pY Blot). As reported previously (33Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15398-15402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), both p130CAS and paxillin immunoprecipitated from suspended NIH-3T3-IR-CAP or NIH-3T3-IR cells contained low but detectable tyrosine phosphorylation, which increased dramatically upon adhesion to fibronectin. This level of tyrosine phosphorylation was similar in NIH-3T3-IR-CAP or NIH-3T3-IR cells. CAP contains three adjacent SH3 domains in the carboxyl terminus and a region with homology to the peptide sorbin at the NH2terminus. DNA sequencing and Northern blot analysis indicated that there are multiple splice variants of CAP that may result in a family of different isoforms expressed in a tissue-specific manner with distinct physiological functions (18Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These transcripts were preferentially highly expressed in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Although CAP mRNA and proteins were not detected in 3T3-L1 or NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, both CAP mRNA and protein isoforms accumulate following differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes (18Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To explore the function of the CAP proteins, we ectopically expressed one isoform in NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (NIH-3T3-IR-CAP). Expression of this protein induced profound morphological changes in these cells, producing larger cells that were prone to spreading. These changes were accompanied by a reduction in growth rate. The morphological changes were substantiated by examining the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and dynamic regulation of signaling proteins thought to be involved in cytoskeleton reorganization. The abnormally enlarged cell shape of NIH-3T3-IR cells expressing CAP compared with normal cells was consistent with increased number and thickness of actin stress fibers along with the formation of vinculin-containing focal adhesions. Moreover, the induction of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion formation in NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells was independent of the type of integrin receptors engaged with extracellular matrix. This was evident when NIH-3T3-IR-CAP or NIH-3T3-IR cells were plated onto laminin-coated dishes. Laminin less efficiently induced organization of actin and focal adhesion formation in NIH-3T3-IR cells, but it supported the actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in CAP-expressing cells as well as fibronectin. These results suggest that ectopic expression of CAP in fibroblasts may reproduce adhesion-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Recent studies have shown that the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is under the control of the small GTP-binding proteins Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (35Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Activation of Rho in fibroblasts results in stress fibers and focal adhesion formation through the bundling of actin filaments, while Rac has been shown to induce actin polymerization at the plasma membrane to form membrane ruffles and lamellipodia (25Ridely A.G. Paterson H.F. Johnson C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar, 35Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell.

Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar). Cdc42 activation triggers the formation of filopodia (37Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical mechanisms that account for the Rho-, Rac-, and Cdc42-mediated changes in actin cytoskeleton remain poorly defined. The induction of dense, highly organized actin stress fibers traversing the cells with focal adhesion formation by CAP expression mimics the effect of Rho on actin organization and focal adhesions (37Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar, 38Mackay D.J.G. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for CAP in the Rho-dependent pathways. Rac has been shown to be involved in insulin-induced membrane ruffling (25Ridely A.G. Paterson H.F. Johnson C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar). The observation that CAP expression failed to inhibit the effect of insulin on the actin reorganization in NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells suggests the involvement of CAP in Rho-mediated stress fiber formation, with only a minor effect on the Rac-induced membrane ruffling. It remains to be determined whether CAP is an upstream or downstream effector of Rho. The subcellular localization of CAP with actin stress fibers suggests that its effect on actin stress fibers and focal adhesion formation in NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells may be due to interactions with proteins associated with cytoskeletal signaling. Indeed, CAP forms stable complexes with the nonreceptor focal adhesion tyrosine kinase p125FAK via its middle SH3 domain. Recently, the SH3 domains of p130CAS and the GTPase regulatory protein Graf, shown to be components of cytoskeletal signaling (39Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 40Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), were found to bind p125FAK. On the other hand, the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of CAP binds c-Cbl. The latter protein has recently been suggested as an intermediate signaling protein in integrin-mediated cell adhesion (18Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,42Ojaniemi M. Martin S.S. Dolfi F. Olefsky J.M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3780-3787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The binding specificity of the three SH3 domains of CAP suggests that coordinate, yet distinct functions of these domains may contribute to the biological role of CAP in modulating actin cytoskeleton organization. A further molecular link between the effect of CAP expression and the cytoskeletal changes is the observation of impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK both in growing cells or following integrin-mediated adhesion. The tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and p130CAS coincides with the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK during integrin-mediated cell adhesion (32Burridge K. Turner C.E. Homer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 111: 893-903Crossref Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 33Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, despite decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in NIH-3T3-IR-CAP cells, there was no parallel decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin or p130CAS in response to adhesion of these cells to extracellular matrix. These results are reminiscent of those observed in cells deficient of p125FAK. FAK-deficient cells possess increased number of focal adhesions, with normal adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130CAS, paxillin, tensin, and cortactin (43Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 37: 539-544Google Scholar, 44Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that p125FAK may be involved in the turnover of focal adhesions rather than in their assembly. This, in turn, would induce tighter adhesion to substrate. The association of CAP with p125FAK, along with the subsequent reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p125FAK, may contribute to the observed altered morphology by promoting inappropriate assembly of an active signaling complex. The inhibitory effect of CAP expression on cell growth is consistent with results obtained in cells microinjected with the carboxyl terminus of p125FAK (45Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 8: 1209-1224Crossref Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We show here for the first time that expression of a SH3 domain-containing protein resulted in increased assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion formation. Our results suggest that CAP may play an important role in a signal transduction network regulating cytoskeleton organization and serve as a framework for further studies to elucidate the mechanism and specific functions of this protein.

https://openalex.org/W2031039047,"<i>R</i>eplication <i>p</i>rotein <i>A</i> (RPA) is a conserved nuclear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein. Human RPA (hRPA) comprises three subunits of approximately 70, 32, and 14 kDa (hRPA70, hRPA32 and hRPA14). RPA is known to bind ssDNA through two ssDNA-binding domains in the RPA70 subunit. Here, we demonstrate that the complex of hRPA32 and hRPA14 has an ssDNA-binding domain. Limited proteolysis of the hRPA14·32 complex defined a core dimer composed of the central region of hRPA32 (amino acids 43–171) and RPA14. The core dimer bound ssDNA with an affinity of approximately 10–50 μm, which is at least 100-fold more avid than the DNA-binding affinity of the intact dimer. Analysis of the predicted secondary structure of hRPA32 suggests that amino acids 63–150 of hRPA32 form an ssDNA-binding domain similar in structure to each of those in hRPA70. The complex of hRPA14 and hRPA32-(43–171) in turn formed a trimeric complex with the C-terminal region of hRPA70 (amino acids 436–616). The ssDNA-binding affinity of this trimeric complex was 3 to 5-fold higher than hRPA14·32-(43–171) alone, suggesting a role for the C terminus of hRPA70 in ssDNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2000664329,"Sequence analysis of cDNA clones corresponding to a number of genes located in the class III region of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC), in the chromosome band 6p21.3, has shown that the G15 gene encodes a 283-amino acid polypeptide with significant homology over the entire polypeptide with the enzyme lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT) from different yeast, plant, and bacterial species. The amino acid sequence of the MHC-encoded human LPAAT (hLPAATα) is 48% identical to the recently described hLPAAT (Eberhardt, C., Gray, P. W., and Tjoelker, L. W. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 20299–20305), which is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 9p34.3. LPAAT is the enzyme that in lipid metabolism converts lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) into phosphatidic acid (PA). The expression of the hLPAATα polypeptide in the baculovirus system and in mammalian cells has shown that it is an intracellular protein that contains LPAAT activity. Cell extracts from insect cells overexpressing hLPAATα were analyzed in different LPAAT enzymatic assays using, as substrates, different acyl acceptors and acyl donors. These cell extracts were found to contain up to 5-fold more LPAAT activity compared with control cell extracts, indicating that the hLPAATα specifically converts LPA into PA, incorporating different acyl-CoAs with different affinities. The hLPAATα polypeptide expressed in the mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cell line was found, by confocal immunofluorescence, to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Due to the known role of LPA and PA in intracellular signaling and inflammation, the hLPAATα gene represents a candidate gene for some MHC-associated diseases.

Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT), 1The abbreviations used are: LPAAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase; hLPAAT, human LPAAT; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PA, phosphatidic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DAG, diacylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; IL, interleukin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; LPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). also known as 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC2.3.1.51), is the enzyme that converts lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) into phosphatidic acid (PA) in the lipid metabolism. LPA or 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate consists of a glycerol backbone with a fatty acyl chain at the sn-1 position, a hydroxyl group at the sn-2 position, and a phosphate group at the sn-3 position. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, LPA is formed from glycerol 3-phosphate through the action of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. LPA is then further acylated in the ER by LPAAT to yield PA, the precursor of all glycerolipids. The rate of acylation of LPA to PA is very high, and consequently, there is little accumulation of LPA at the site of biosynthesis. PA can either be hydrolyzed by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase to yield diacylglycerol (DAG) or, alternatively, can be converted to CDP-DAG for the synthesis of more complex phospholipids in the ER, from which they are transported to different subcellular compartments. PA can be produced by this de novo synthesis or, alternatively, by phospholipase D hydrolysis of phospholipids, such as phospha- tidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine, or through phosphorylation of DAG by DAG kinase (for a general description, see Refs. 1Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar and 2Lodish H. Baltimore D. Berk A. Zipursky S.L. Matsudaira P. Darnell J. Molecular Cell Biology. 3rd Ed. Scientific American Books, New York1995Google Scholar). Naturally occurring glycerolipids generally exhibit a nonrandom distribution of the acyl constituents; saturated fatty acids are esterified predominantly at the C-1 position and unsaturated fatty acids at the C-2 position (for a review see Refs. 3Yamashita S. Hosaka K. Miki Y. Numa S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 528-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar and 4Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. XVI. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983: 87-111Google Scholar). Previous studies carried out using a semipurified LPAAT from rat liver microsomes indicated that LPAAT exhibited a significant acyl donor specificity for monoeic and dienoeic acyl-CoA thioesters (5Yamashita S. Hosaka K. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 38: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the activity of the enzyme was essentially not affected by the fatty acid constituent of the acyl acceptor (LPA), except that the 1-stearoyl and 1-arachidonoyl LPAs were somewhat less effective acyl acceptors (6Miki Y. Hosaka K. Yamashita S. Handa H. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This acyl acceptor specificity was also found for lyso-PC acyltransferase when using different lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) as substrates. The acyl acceptor specificity of LPAAT, however, does depend on the polar head group, and LPAAT is highly specific for LPA. In contrast, lyso-PC acyltransferase utilizes several acyl acceptors differing in the polar head group, except that LPA and lysophosphatidylethanol are ineffective substrates (6Miki Y. Hosaka K. Yamashita S. Handa H. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) spans ∼4 megabase pairs in the chromosome band 6p21.3 and is divided into three regions (7Campbell R.D. Trowsdale J. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18 (centerfold)Google Scholar). The class I and II regions contain the classical MHC genes, which encode cell-surface glycoproteins involved in the presentation of antigenic peptides to T cells during an immune response. These are interspersed with a large number of other genes, some of which encode proteins involved in antigen processing. The class I and class II regions are separated by the central class III region that spans 1100 kilobase pairs of DNA (7Campbell R.D. Trowsdale J. Immunol.

Characterization of a 220-kilobase pair segment of DNA located between the class II region and the complementC4 genes in the class III region of the human MHC has revealed that the region contains at least nine genes (9Kendall E.

We have found that one of the uncharacterized genes (G15) encodes a protein that has significant homology with LPAAT from bacteria, plant, and yeast species, suggesting that it could be the human homologue.

Bursten S. Coleman J. Kumar A. Singer J.W. Leung D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) named the two hLPAATs as LPAATα and LPAATβ. In this report, we describe the finding, through cDNA sequence analysis and expression of the encoded polypeptide in insect and mammalian cell lines, that the MHC class III region geneG15 codes for a hLPAAT (hLPAATα). We also report a detailed characterization of the enzymatic activity of hLPAATα and the localization of the enzyme in the ER. Screening of a U937 cDNA library, using two overlapping cosmids (D3A and E91) from the MHC class III region as probes, resulted in the isolation of 22 cDNA clones (9Kendall E. Sargent C.A. Campbell R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7251-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Characterization of these clones by restriction enzyme mapping revealed that pG15–3B contained a full-length cDNA insert of ∼2.1 kilobase pairs. Both strands of this cDNA were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method after random sonicated fragments were cloned in the size range 300–1000 bp by blunt end ligation intoSmaI-cut M13mp18. The sequence was assembled using the Staden (19Staden R. Bishop M.J. Rawlings C.J. Nucleic Acid and Protein Sequence Analysis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1987: 173-217Google Scholar) programs and determined with a degeneracy of 9.0. Computer analyses were performed using the software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG) (20Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar). To remove the 3′- and 5′-flanking sequences of the G15 cDNA (hLPAATα), to express only the coding sequence under the control of the polyhedrin promoter, a PCR copy of the open reading frame was generated using oligonucleotide primers that also created XbaI sites adjacent to the initiating AUG codon and the stop codon. The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: sense (5′-GCGGTCTAGA ATGGATTTGTGGCCAGG-3′) and antisense (5′-CCGCTCTAGAGCCAGGGTTCACCCACC-3′), in which the XbaI sites are in italics, and the initiating and stop codons are in boldface type. This PCR copy was gel-isolated and ligated into the XbaI-digested plasmid pBluescript KS+ (pBlsc), and several clones were sequenced. The insert of one clone (pG15Bls) that did not include any PCR errors was excised and ligated to the XbaI-cut baculovirus transfer vector pAcCL29.1 (21Livingstone C. Jones I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), kindly donated by Dr. I. Jones (NERC Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology, Oxford), to yield pG15Bac (hLPAATα). Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) insect cells and wild type baculovirus (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus) were kindly donated by Dr A. Alcamı́ (Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford). Sf21 insect cells were grown in TC100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Sf21 cells were cotransfected with BacPAK6 DNA (CLONTECH) and pG15Bac (hLPAATα), using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), to generate hLPAATα recombinants. Ten clones were isolated and plaque-purified four times. The expression of the recombinant hLPAATα was confirmed by metabolic labeling, and one of these viruses, vG15Bac (hLPAATα), was selected for further experiments. The recombinant AcB15R has been described previously (22Alcamı́ A. Smith G.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 153-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Sf21 cells were infected at 10 plaque forming units/cell and pulse-labeled from 24 to 27 h postinfection with 200 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals; a mixture of ∼80% [35S]methionine and ∼20% [35S]cysteine, 1200 Ci/mmol) in methionine-free TC100 medium in the absence of serum. Cells and extracellular media were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 12% acrylamide gels. Radioactive bands were detected by fluorography with Amplify (Amersham Corp.). To express the hLPAATα fused at the C terminus to a T7.Tag sequence (MASMTGGQQMGRDP), for which specific monoclonal antibodies are commercially available (T7.TagmAb) (Novagen), the last 270 bp encoding the C terminus of the coding sequence of hLPAATα (from pG15Bls) were PCR-amplified. In this amplification, a NcoI site at the 3′-end of the cDNA was created to remove the stop codon and to fuse hLPAATα in frame to the T7.Tag sequence, located in T7.TagpBlsc (kindly donated by C. Winchester, from this laboratory). The oligonucleotide primers used for the PCR were as follows: sense (5′-CCATCTTGCAGTGCAGGCC-3′) and antisense (5′-TAGCCATGG CACCGCCCCCAGGCTTCTTC-3′), in which theNcoI site is indicated in italics and the disrupted stop codon is shown in boldface type. The PCR product was isolated and cloned into pBlsc, the DNA sequence was confirmed, and one clone (pG15COOH-Blsc) was digested with AvaI–NcoI to isolate the insert. To obtain the 5′-end of the coding sequence, pG15Bls was digested with XbaI, end-filled, and then digested with AvaI, and the 0.68-kilobase pair blunt end/AvaI fragment was isolated and ligated together with theAvaI–NcoI fragment encoding the C-terminal region into EcoRV/NcoI-digested T7.TagpBlsc. The proper ligation of the two fragments into the vector was confirmed by sequence analysis. A HindIII–XbaI insert, containing the hLPAATα cDNA fused to the T7.Tag sequence, was isolated and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) cut with HindIII–XbaI to generate pcDNA3G15Tag. CHO cells were electroporated with linearized (SspI) pcDNA3G15Tag or pcDNA3 and incubated for 2 days with GMEMS (for CHO cells, Advanced Protein Products Ltd.), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. After that time, cells were subcultured at different densities containing different concentrations of geneticin sulfate (G418). Expression of the protein was confirmed after 13 days of transfection by Western blot analysis (ECL method, Amersham) using the T7.TagmAb, and those groups of cells expressing the hLPAATα recombinant protein were diluted to obtain single clones expressing hLPAATα. Expression of the protein in the single clones was confirmed by Western blotting, and three of them were analyzed by immunofluorescence and for LPAAT activity. One of the clones, CHOG15 (hLPAATα), was chosen for subsequent experiments. Single clones containing only the vector were created in parallel, and the presence of the vector was confirmed by PCR screening using specific pcDNA3 primers. Three of these clones were used in immunofluorescence and enzyme activity assays as negative controls for the hLPAATα transfectants, and one of these, CHOV, was chosen for further experiments. Sf21 cells were infected with the wild type (A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus) or vG15Bac (hLPAATα) baculovirus at low multiplicity of infection (2 plaque-forming units/cell). Cells were harvested 72 h postinfection (or when the cytopathic effect was total) and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, followed by four cycles of freeze-thaw and then Dounce homogenization. The homogenates were spun down for 10 min at 2000 rpm, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Miki et al. (6Miki Y. Hosaka K. Yamashita S. Handa H. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that a semipurified LPAAT, obtained from rat liver microsomes, contained similar activity for 1-myristoyl, 1-palmitoyl, 1-oleoyl, and 1-linoleoyl LPAs. For convenience, we have used in our assays 1-oleoyl LPA, since it was possible to obtain this compound also in a radiolabeled form. The spectrophotometric analysis for measurement of LPAAT activity was performed at room temperature essentially as described by Yamashita et al. (3Yamashita S. Hosaka K. Miki Y. Numa S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 528-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the reaction of the thiol group of the released CoA with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) spectrophotometrically giving an increase in absorbance at 413 nm. A typical incubation mixture consisted of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTNB, 50 μm LPA (oleoyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate) (Sigma), 10–45 μm acyl-CoA (Sigma), and 50–150 μg of cell homogenate in a total volume of 1 ml. DTNB was added as a 0.01 msolution in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The reaction was initiated by the addition of acyl-CoA after preincubation of the enzyme with all of the other components for 2 min. A molar absorbance of 13,600 m−1 was used to calculate the activity. To assay the enzyme activity by TLC, the assay procedure was essentially as described above except that 4 μg of enzyme homogenate in a total volume of 10 μl was used, and instead of adding DTNB, 0.02 μCi/μl 3H-LPA (1-oleoyl) (NEN Life Science Products) was used. The assay was also performed using 50 μmunlabeled LPA and 0.005 μCi/μl 14C-oleoyl-CoA (Amersham). The reaction was terminated by directly spotting it onto a silica gel 60 TLC plate (Merck) and developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:10:3:1). To determine the position of substrate and products, LPA and PA standards were loaded and visualized by exposure to iodine vapors. When 3H-LPA was used, fluorography was done by immersion of the TLC plate in chloroform containing 10% 2,5-diphenyloxazole for 10 s and then dried without exposure to iodine vapors. The labeled products were detected by autoradiography. Cells were grown on glass cover slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 250 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, for 30 min, and quenched in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The primary and secondary antibodies were added in 0.2% gelatin, 0.05% saponin in PBS for 45 min. The secondary antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse-IgG (Sigma Immunochemicals), while the 1D3 primary monoclonal antibody (mAb), was kindly donated by Dr D. Vaux (Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford). Nonpermeabilized conditions were without detergent and involved incubation of the primary mAb at 4 °C to avoid permeabilization and internalization of the mAbs and membrane proteins. Immunofluorescence was observed using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. A nearly full-length cDNA clone (pG15–3B) corresponding to the single copy gene G15, located in the MHC class III region, was isolated from a U937 cDNA library (9Kendall E. Sargent C.A. Campbell R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7251-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and sequenced. The 2045-bp cDNA insert, with a poly(A) signal AATAAA 17 bp upstream of a 21-bp poly(A) tail at one end (Fig.1 a), contained a single long open reading frame, which was predicted to encode a 31.7-kDa protein. The hydrophobicity plot (Fig. 1 b) of the 283-amino acid predicted polypeptide (Fig. 1 a) revealed the presence of seven potential hydrophobic regions, suggesting that the G15gene product could be a membrane-spanning protein. In addition, at the N terminus there are two putative signal cleavage sites after amino acids 22 and 58, respectively. The FastA and BestFit programs from the GCG package revealed significant sequence homology between the entire sequence of theG15 gene product and LPAAT from different organisms (Fig.2) such as bacteria (Hemophilus influenzae (30.4% identity) (23Fleischmann R.D.

Multiple sequence alignment of these sequences, using the Pile-up program from the GCG package, shows that they are highly related (Fig.2 b), suggesting that the MHC-linked G15 gene encodes a human LPAAT. Comparison of the G15 gene product (hLPAATα) with the hLPAAT (hLPAATβ) encoded by a gene located in chromosome 9 (16West J. Tompkins C.K. Balantac N. Nudelman E. Meengs B. White T. Bursten S.

Radiolabeling of Sf21 insect cells infected with vG15Bac (hLPAATα) showed, in cell extracts, a major specific polypeptide of 26 kDa and a minor specific polypeptide of 28 kDa that were not observed in infections with a control virus expressing the secreted vaccinia virus interleukin 1β (IL-1β) receptor (AcB15R) (22Alcamı́ A. Smith G.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 153-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) or with the wild type virus (Fig.3 a). hLPAATα was not detected in the medium (Fig. 3 a), in contrast to the secreted control AcB15R. When the radiolabeling was performed in the presence of tunicamycin, no difference in the hLPAATα size was observed (data not shown), indicating that the single potentialN-glycosylation site situated at amino acids 184–186 (Fig.1 a) is not glycosylated, consistent with its predicted cytosolic localization (see below). For expression in CHO cells, a 14-amino acid T7 epitope tag (T7.Tag) was fused to the C terminus of hLPAATα, and stable cell lines expressing hLPAATα (CHOG15) or containing only the transfer vector pcDNA3 (CHOV) were produced. Western blot analysis of cell extracts from the cell lines CHO, CHOG15 (hLPAATα), or CHOV using a T7.TagmAb showed a specific tagged hLPAATα band of 27 kDa only in the cell line CHOG15 (hLPAATα) (Fig. 3 b). The SigCleave program in the GCG package predicts two signal peptides, one that would be cleaved after amino acid 22 and the second after amino acid 58 (Fig. 1). Since the expected molecular mass for hLPAATα is ∼31.7 kDa, including the signal peptide, the ∼28- and ∼26-kDa forms found in insect cells could be explained by the processing of hLPAATα after each of the potential cleavage sites. However, in CHOG15 (hLPAATα) cells, only a single band of ∼27 kDa was seen. When the molecular weight of the 14-amino acid T7.Tag is taken into account, the size of the hLPAATα polypeptide will be ∼26 kDa, and this is similar in size to the major band found for hLPAATα expressed in insect cells using baculovirus (Fig. 3). This suggests that the major cleavage site for the signal peptide is at amino acid 58 and that the cleavage at amino acid 22 observed in insect cells could be due to aberrant processing. Since it is also possible that anomalous migration of the protein (due to its hydrophobic nature) during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is taking place, further experiments will be required to characterize the amino terminus of the mature protein. The Predict-protein program (EMBL, Heidelberg) (30Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), using the alignment of the different LPAATs and assuming cleavage of the hLPAATα after amino acid 58, predicts only two transmembrane domains, one from amino acid 130 to 147 and one from amino acid 195 to 211 (Fig.1 and 2 b). The predicted topology of the protein would be as illustrated in Fig. 4, with the amino terminus in the ER lumen, followed by a transmembrane domain, a cytoplasmic loop, another transmembrane domain, and the C terminus in the ER lumen. A highly conserved region, distinct from the transmembrane regions, between amino acids 176 and 196, would be located on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, where phospholipid synthesis occurs (31Coleman R.A. Bell R.M. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. XVI. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983: 605-625Google Scholar), indicating a potential active center of the enzyme (Fig. 2 b and 4). Comparative sequence analysis of the different LPAATs with the available glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase sequences revealed that they show a higher sequence similarity in this region, supporting the hypothesis of this being the active center (data not shown). The two conserved transmembrane regions could also be part of the active center and select for the length and degree of saturation of the acyl chains (Figs. 2 b and 4). In this model, the potential glycosylation site would be located on the cytosolic side of the ER and for this reason would be unavailable for glycosylation. The model would still be valid for the localization of the active center and carboxyl terminus even if"
https://openalex.org/W2079723980,"In mammalian cells, there are three pyrimidine nucleoside salvage enzymes with the capacity to phosphorylate all four deoxynucleosides, the two thymidine kinase isoenzymes, TK1 and TK2, and the deoxycytidine kinase, dCK. TK1 is cell cycle-regulated; TK2 is expressed constitutively and can phosphorylate deoxycytidine to the same extent as thymidine. dCK phosphorylates deoxycytidine, deoxyadenosine, and deoxyguanosine, but not thymidine. In addition, the three kinases can phosphorylate a number of medically important analogs. In cultured Drosophila melanogaster embryonic cells, only one pyrimidine deoxynucleoside kinase was present. This kinase was purified and showed a broad substrate specificity, since it was able to phosphorylate all four deoxynucleosides with high efficiency, as compared with the kinases in mammalian cells. Additionally, a number of nucleoside analogs such as arabinofuranosyl pyrimidines, deoxyuridine, and 5′-fluorodeoxyuridine, were phosphorylated. There was negligible 3′-azidothymidine and no dTMP phosphorylation. The enzyme was active as a monomer of about 30 kDa. We suggest the name D. melanogaster deoxynucleoside kinase for this multifunctional kinase. The substrate specificity, size, and other characteristics show that this enzyme is more related to human TK2 than to the other mammalian deoxyribonucleoside kinases, but is unique with respect to the capacity to phosphorylate all four deoxynucleosides.

The biosynthesis of deoxynucleoside triphosphates in most living organisms is performed by two pathways, the de novo and the salvage pathway. The main enzyme of the de novo pathway is ribonucleotide reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of the 2′-OH group of the nucleoside diphosphates. The enzyme has been extensively studied as to the structure and the complex feedback regulation by the end products, the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2Reichard P. Ehrenberg A. Science. 1983; 221: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar).An alternative pathway for supplying deoxynucleoside triphosphates for replication and repair of DNA is the salvage pathway. The principal salvage enzymes are the deoxynucleoside kinases, which phosphorylate deoxynucleosides to the corresponding deoxynucleoside monophosphates.

The substrate specificities of the mammalian deoxynucleoside kinases toward natural substrates and a number of therapeutic nucleoside analogs differ considerably, but with a characteristic pattern useful for distinction between the enzymes (13Arnér E.S.J. Spasokukotskaja T. Eriksson S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition to thymidine (dThd), 2′-deoxyuridine (dUrd), and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FdUrd), TK1 can phosphorylate 3′-azidothymidine (AZT) and 3′-fluoro-2′,3′-dThd (FddThd), and TK2 can phosphorylate deoxycytidine (dCyd) and 1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl thymine (AraT) (13Arnér E.S.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The occurrence of cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of thymidine kinases has also been observed in lower eucaryotes. In the filamentous fungus Achlya ambisexualis, four forms of TK were found, one readily solubilized and three solubilized by detergent. The multiple TK forms were distinctive by their electrophoretic properties, and one of the detergent solubilized forms resembled TK2 in the ability to phosphorylate dCyd (17Lam F.K. Jing G.J. Leung W.-C. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1988; 66: 318-324Crossref Google Scholar).Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is one of the genetically and developmentally most characterized organisms. However, so far, the metabolism of deoxynucleotides and its regulation and role in the cell proliferation and differentiation during embryogenesis has been only poorly investigated, and to our knowledge there have been no reports about deoxynucleoside kinases in this organism or other insect cells. In the present paper, we describe the purification and characterization of a deoxynucleoside kinase from the fruit fly. The purified kinase is multifunctional and apparently the only deoxynucleoside kinase present in the cultured DrosophilaS-2 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, Phenyl-Sepharose, the Superose 12 HR 10/30 column, and SDS-polyacrylamide molecular weight standards were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The 3′-dTMP-Sepharose gel-matrix (p-aminophenyl-3′-TMP:CH-Sepharose) was prepared according to the procedure described by Kowal and Markus (18Kowal E.P. Markus G. Prep. Biochem. 1976; 6: 369-385PubMed Google Scholar), using thymidine-3′-(4-aminophenyl-phosphate) kindly donated by Eger et al. (19Eger K. Klunder E. Beck R.A. Schloz U. Pharmaceut. Res. 1993; 10: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Fetal calf serum was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and the gel-filtration molecular weight standards, Schneider's medium, unlabeled nucleotides and nucleosides, ultrapure ammonium sulfate and CHAPS were purchased from Sigma. 3H-Labeled thymidine (925 GBq/mmol) and deoxycytidine (740–925 GBq/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Corp. 3H-Labeled deoxyadenosine (1106 GBq), deoxyguanosine (226 GBq/mmol), deoxyuridine (629 GBq/mmol), 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine (703 GBq), 2′,3′-dideoxy-2′,3′-didehydrothymidine (744 GBq/mmol), 3′-fluoro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (289 GBq/mmol), 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (740 GBq/mmol), 1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl thymine (107 GBq/mmol), 1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl cytosine (862 GBq/mmol), 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (185 GBq/mmol), and acyclovir (655 GBq/mmol) were from Moravek Biochemicals Inc., Brea, CA. When present, ethanol was evaporated and the analog resuspended in water. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. All solutions were made with ultrafiltered (0.22 μm) and autoclaved water, purified by the Milli-RO 15 water system from Millipore.CellsThe D. melanogaster S-2 cell line of embryonic origin were grown in Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a Brown Biostat M bioreactor (B. Brown, Melsungen, Germany) as described previously (20Søndergaard L. Biotechnol. Tech. 1996; 10: 161-166Crossref Google Scholar). Cells (8.6 × 1010) were harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g) and pellets stored at −80 °C until used for enzyme purification.Enzyme AssaysThe nucleoside kinase activities were determined by initial velocity measurements based on four time samples by the DE-81 filter paper assay using tritium-labeled substrates (14Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard assay conditions were: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (22 °C), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm CHAPS, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mmATP, and 10 μm radiolabeled substrate, unless otherwise indicated.The products of the kinase reaction were analyzed by mixing samples of 10 μl from a standard reaction mixture with 20 μl of 5 mm dThd, dTMP, dTDP, and dTTP, and spotting 10 μl of this solution on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates. After developing the plates ascending in 0.5 m LiCl2, the spots with nucleosides and nucleotides were identified under UV light and cut out. The radioactivity was extracted with 0.2 m KCl, 0.1m HCl and determined by liquid scintillation.The variance in duplicate assays was below 5% (CV). The variance in the determination of kinetic constants in two independent experiments was below 20% (CV). One unit of activity is defined as 1 nmol of deoxynucleoside 5′-monophosphate formed/min. Specific activity is expressed as units/mg of protein, where the kinase activity is measured at saturating substrate concentrations.Enzyme PurificationBuffersBuffer A consisted of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 15% glycerol, 1 mm potassium EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Buffer B consisted of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (20 °C), 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Buffer C consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 (20 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm CHAPS. Buffer D consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (20 °C), 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm CHAPS. Buffer E consisted of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Buffer F consisted of 50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mKCl.Purification steps I–V were performed at 4 °C according to previously described procedures (14Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications.Step I: Preparation of Crude ExtractThe pellet containing 8.6 × 1010 Drosophila S-2 cells was suspended in buffer A and homogenized by treatment with a French press. The homogenate was centrifuged 30 min at 12,000 × g(fraction I).Step II: Streptomycin/Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation and G-25 ChromatographyThe nucleic acids were precipitated with streptomycin sulfate (0.7%), and the resulting supernatant precipitated with ammonium sulfate in two steps (20% and 70%) as described elsewhere (15Bohman C. Eriksson S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4258-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All centrifugations were performed at 12,000 × g. The ammonium sulfate pellet was suspended in buffer B, divided in three portions of about 30 ml, and each portion was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (bed volume, 50 mm × 200 mm) with buffer B. The peak fractions were collected and pooled (fraction II).Step III: DEAE Ion Exchange ChromatographyFraction II was divided in three portions, and each portion was chromatographed on a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column (bed volume, 50 mm × 250 mm), equilibrated with buffer B + 0.5 mm CHAPS. After application, unbound material was washed out with buffer B + 0.5 mm CHAPS (600 ml) and the bound material was eluted with a 0–0.5 m KCl gradient in buffer B (2 × 1.2 liters). The fractions containing TK and dCK activity were pooled (fraction III).Step IV: 3′-dTMP-Sepharose ChromatographyFraction III was divided in three portions, and each portion was applied on a 3′-dTMP-Sepharose column (bed volume, 10 mm × 64 mm) equilibrated with buffer C. The unbound material was washed out with buffer C and then with buffer D, and the bound material was eluted with buffer D containing 2 mm dThd. The fractions containing TK activity were pooled (fraction IV).Step V: Phenyl-Sepharose ChromatographyFraction IV was made 1.5 m with ammonium sulfate and applied on a Phenyl-Sepharose column (10 mm × 12.8 mm) equilibrated with buffer E + 1.5 m ammonium sulfate. The unbound material was washed out with the equilibration buffer. The bound material was eluted in two steps, first with buffer E and thereafter with buffer E + 10 mm CHAPS.Molecular Weight DeterminationsThe subunit size of the purified protein was determined by discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in Tris-HCl (pH 6.8 and 8.8, 22 °C) with a stacking gel of 4.5% and a separating gel of 12%, according to the procedure of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). The protein bands were visualized by silver staining.The apparent size of the native enzyme was determined by gel-filtration on a prepacked Superose 12 column connected to a Gradifrac system essentially as described (14Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The column was equilibrated and the enzyme eluted with buffer F.Other MethodsThe protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). Conductivity was measured with the CDM 3 Radiometer conductivity meter using the CDC 314 cell.DISCUSSIONThe present work was initiated with the purpose to investigate the pattern of TK isoenzymes in D. melanogaster, and to compare it with the situation in other organisms. In the initial purification steps, the TK isoenzymes from mammalian cells, TK1 and TK2, were separated from each other and from dCK by DEAE ion exchange chromatography (14Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the desalted ammonium sulfate fraction from cultured Drosophila S-2 cells (fraction II) was chromatographed on DEAE-Sepharose under conditions identical to those applied for the mammalian enzymes, only one peak of TK and dCK activity was obtained, with the activities coinciding (Fig. 1). This indicated the absence of deoxynucleoside kinases equivalent to the mammalian TK1 and dCK.The single peak obtained from the DEAE chromatography contained all four deoxynucleoside kinase activities, and these activities were co-purified more than 20,000-fold (Table I) to nearly 99% purity, as judged from SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The activities were not separable during the molecular weight determinations. In the SDS gel, there was a single band with a mass of 30 kDa (Fig. 2), and the four kinase activities migrated together on the Superose 12 column with an apparent size of about 33 kDa (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the dAK, dCK, dGK, and TK activities were all bound to the dTMP-Sepharose matrix, were eluted together in the thymidine buffer, and were bound to Phenyl-Sepharose, where the strong binding required more than 5 mm CHAPS to elute the activities. Together, these results indicate that the four deoxynucleoside kinase activities were associated to the same monomeric protein of about 30 kDa. It is proposed to designate this multifunctional kinase asDm-dNK.The occurrence of multifunctional deoxynucleoside kinases with two or three of the four deoxynucleoside kinase activities has been observed previously in mammalian cells. TK2 is also a dCyd kinase (14Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and dCK can phosphorylate dAdo and dGuo, although with lower efficiency than dCyd (15Bohman C. Eriksson S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4258-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, a kinase with the ability to phosphorylate all four deoxynucleoside kinase has to our knowledge not been found previously. From Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26, two heterodimeric deoxynucleoside kinases, a dGK/dAK and a dCK/dAK have been isolated (23Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The two kinases showed different binding affinities, as dCK/dAK bound to dCTP-Sepharose, whereas dGK/dAK bound to dATP-Sepharose. in Drosophila, a similar arrangement of closely related monomeric proteins with the same size, each specific for one or two of the substrates, seems unlikely, since all deoxynucleoside kinase activities of Dm-dNK were bound to dTMP-Sepharose.The Km values for the four deoxynucleoside substrates (Table III) were compared with those reported for TK1 from human lymphocytes (24Munch-Petersen B. Tyrsted G. Cloos L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15621-15625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TK2 (14Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and dCK (15Bohman C. Eriksson S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4258-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) from human leukemic spleen, and dGK from human brain (16Wang L. Karlsson A. Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With dCyd and dThd, theDm-dNK Km values were in the low micromolar range around 1 μm, and comparable toKm for dCyd found for human dCK (1 μm) and for dThd found for the high affinity form of human TK1 (0.5 μm). The Dm-dNK Km values for dAdo and dGuo were about 100- and 650-fold higher than those for dCyd and dThd, respectively. However, the Dm-dNKKm value for dAdo was in the same range as that found for the human dCK, and the Dm-dNKKm value for dGuo was about 5.5-fold higher than the one found with the human dCK, and 86-fold higher than the one found with the bovine dGK. The kinetics was clearly classical Michaelis-Menten, in contrast to the kinetics of mammalian TKs and dCK, which exhibited cooperative reaction mechanism with their deoxynucleoside substrates (14Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bohman C. Eriksson S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4258-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Munch-Petersen B. Tyrsted G. Cloos L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15621-15625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)The specific activities were high for all four Dm-dNK activities, about 30,000 units/mg for dCyd and dThd, and about 36,000 for dAdo and dGuo, corresponding to kcat values of 15 s−1 for the TK and dCK activities, and 18–19 s−1 for the dAK and dGK activities. When compared with thekcat values calculated for the mammalian enzymes, using the subunit masses, those of Dm-dNK were manyfold higher, about 4-fold higher compared with TK1 (14Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 200-, 60-, and 45-fold higher compared with the dCK, dAK, and dGK activities of human dCK (15Bohman C. Eriksson S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4258-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), respectively, and 13,000- and 9000-fold higher compared with the dGK and dAK activities of bovine dGK (16Wang L. Karlsson A. Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Likewise, the specificity constantskcat/Km for theDm-dNK ranged from 2.6 × 104s−1m−1 to 1.6 × 107 s−1m−1 (TableIII), and were manyfold higher as compared with the corresponding mammalian activities. The lowest specificity constant of Dm-dNK was that for dGuo, but it was an order of magnitude higher than that for human dCK-dGuo (2.7 × 103s−1m−1) and bovine dGK-dGuo (2.8 × 103 s−1m−1). Regarding these relations and the levels of specific activities, it is likely that the dAK and dGK activities of the Dm-dNK play a significant role for the supply of purine deoxynucleotides for replication and repair of DNA in Drosophila cells.The substrate inhibition studies indicated that the four substrates competed with each other (Table IV). dThd was a strong inhibitor of the phosphorylation of dCyd, dAdo, and dGuo with Ki values in the range of Km for dThd. dAdo and dGuo were able to compete with each other with Ki values in the range of their Km values. Furthermore, dAdo and dGuo were relatively efficient inhibitors of the phosphorylation of thymidine. Together, these data indicate that the four substrates are phosphorylated at the same site of the enzyme.The absence of a TK equivalent to the mammalian S-phase specific TK1 was unexpected, as other DNA replication associated enzymes previously have been isolated from Drosophila embryonic cells (25Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kaguni L.S. Rossignol J.-M. Conaway R.C. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2221-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Additionally, the absence of a dCK equivalent to the mammalian dCK should be noted. On the other hand, as discussed above, the dCK and TK activities of the Dm-dNK are even more efficient in their phosphorylation capacities than the mammalian kinases.The specificity toward a number of nucleoside substrates showed interesting properties of the Dm-dNK (Table II). Thus, in addition to the four deoxynucleosides, dUrd and FdUrd were phosphorylated to the same degree as dThd and dCyd and, unexpectedly, both arabinosyl furanosyl pyrimidines were phosphorylated. Such a diverse substrate specificity has to our knowledge not been found for other eucaryotic and bacterial deoxynucleoside kinases.Dm-dNK was eluted from the DEAE matrix at essentially the same KCl concentration as human TK2 (14Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but also in other aspects there were similarities. Like TK2 (14Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Dm-dNK was a monomer of about 30 kDa with dCK activity, showed negligible capacity to phosphorylate AZT, was able to phosphorylate AraT (Table II), and could use CTP as a phosphate donor. However, mammalian TK2 is unable to phosphorylate dAdo or dGuo.With respect to the capacity to phosphorylate the other arabinofuranosyl nucleoside analog, AraC, the Dm-dNK resembles human dCK that had a kcat value of 7 × 10−2 s−1 and a specificity constant of 3.5 × 103 s−1m−1 (15Bohman C. Eriksson S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4258-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The Dm-dNK, however, was even more efficient with a 390-fold higher kcatvalue (27 s−1) and a 280-fold higher specificity constant (Table III).From the properties regarding the native and subunit size, substrate specificity, kinetic constants, and substrate interaction, it is rational to propose that the multifunctional efficient deoxynucleoside kinase from Drosophila S-2 cells is an enzyme with unique properties not hitherto found in any organism. Whether the multifunctional Drosophila deoxynucleoside kinase is present in other insects is currently under investigation. The biosynthesis of deoxynucleoside triphosphates in most living organisms is performed by two pathways, the de novo and the salvage pathway. The main enzyme of the de novo pathway is ribonucleotide reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of the 2′-OH group of the nucleoside diphosphates. The enzyme has been extensively studied as to the structure and the complex feedback regulation by the end products, the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2Reichard P. Ehrenberg A. Science. 1983; 221: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). An alternative pathway for supplying deoxynucleoside triphosphates for replication and repair of DNA is the salvage pathway. The principal salvage enzymes are the deoxynucleoside kinases, which phosphorylate deoxynucleosides to the corresponding deoxynucleoside monophosphates. In mammalian cells, there are four deoxynucleoside kinases with different cellular localization and specificities, thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), 1The abbreviations used are: TK1, cytoplasmic specific thymidine kinase; TK2, mitochondrial thymidine kinase; AraC, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine; AraT, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylthymine; AZT, 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine; CHAPS, 3-((3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio)-1-propylsulfonic acid; dAdo, deoxyadenosine; dAK, deoxyadenosine kinase; dCK, deoxycytidine kinase; dCyd, deoxycytidine; dGK, deoxyguanosine kinase; dGuo, deoxyguanosine; Dm-dNK, D. melanogasterdeoxynucleoside kinase; dThd, thymidine; dUrd, deoxyuridine; FddThd, 3′-fluoro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine; FdUrd, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine; TK, thymidine kinase; CV, coefficient of variation.1The abbreviations used are: TK1, cytoplasmic specific thymidine kinase; TK2, mitochondrial thymidine kinase; AraC, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine; AraT, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylthymine; AZT, 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine; CHAPS, 3-((3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio)-1-propylsulfonic acid; dAdo, deoxyadenosine; dAK, deoxyadenosine kinase; dCK, deoxycytidine kinase; dCyd, deoxycytidine; dGK, deoxyguanosine kinase; dGuo, deoxyguanosine; Dm-dNK, D. melanogasterdeoxynucleoside kinase; dThd, thymidine; dUrd, deoxyuridine; FddThd, 3′-fluoro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine; FdUrd, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine; TK, thymidine kinase; CV, coefficient of variation. thymidine kinase 2 (TK2), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK).

https://openalex.org/W2094943998,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent phospholipid with diverse physiological and pathological actions, and it is inactivated by PAF acetylhydrolase. In this study, we analyzed the tissue distribution of the plasma PAF acetylhydrolase mRNA in humans. We isolated a 3.5-kilobase fragment containing the 5′ genomic sequence of the plasma PAF acetylhydrolase gene and further characterized the promoter activity. We determined the transcriptional initiation site by primer extension. We then prepared constructs containing various lengths of 5′ genomic fragments fused to a luciferase reporter gene and transfected these constructs into COS-7 cells. We found that there is more than one region in the 1.3-kilobase 5′ genomic sequence conferring promoter activity and that a very short 5′-flanking region (72 base pairs) is sufficient for more than 65% of the basal activity. In parallel, we examined the regulation of expression of the PAF acetylhydrolase gene. We found that interferon-γ (IFNγ) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly inhibited synthesis of PAF acetylhydrolase, whereas other cytokines, including IFNα, interleukin (IL) 1α, IL4, IL6, tumor necrosis factor-α, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, had a smaller or no effect in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Furthermore, transfection of the promoter/reporter construct into macrophage RAW264.7 cells revealed that IFNγ and LPS decreased the promoter activity by 35% and 50%, respectively, whereas PAF stimulated it by 52% via its receptor. The promoter activity was much lower in monocytic U937 cells compared with the basal level in COS-7 cells, while the activities in P388D1 and RAW264.7 macrophagic cells were considerably higher than the basal level in COS-7 cells. There are multiple regions in the PAF acetylhydrolase promoter that contain responsive elements for signal transducer and activators of transcription-related proteins, and also for myeloid-specific transcription factors. Our data indicate that the opposite of mRNA expression in monocytes versusmacrophages is due to inhibition of the promoter activity in the former and activation in the latter cells.

Platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1The abbreviations used are: PAF, platelet-activating factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; kb, kilobase(s); IFNγ, interferon-γ; IL, interleukin; bp, base pair(s); TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; GM-CSF, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; DIF, differentiation-induced factor.1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is a potent phospholipid with diverse physiological and pathological effects in a variety of cells and tissues (for review, see Refs. 1Snyder F.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 691-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological effects of PAF include activation of platelets, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. PAF also increases vascular permeability, decreases cardiac output, induces hypotension, and stimulates uterine contraction (2Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17381-17384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actions of PAF may contribute to the physiological processes associated with pregnancy, fetal development, parturition, and kidney function. PAF has been implicated in pathological processes, such as inflammation and allergy (4Snyder F. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C697-C708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, there are indications that PAF might be involved in human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis and in carcinogenesis (5Squinto S.P. Braquet P. Block A.L. Bazan N.G. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,6Bennett S.A. Leite L.C. Birnboim H.C. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The levels of PAF in plasma and tissues are determined by the balance of synthesis and degradation (7Snyder F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 689-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A key mechanism for the removal of PAF is hydrolysis catalyzed by PAF acetylhydrolase, which converts PAF to the biologically inactive lyso-PAF (8Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This enzymatic activity has been detected in plasma and in the cytosolic fraction of some cells and tissues (9Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Lipids. 1991; 26: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular studies of the PAF acetylhydrolase from various sources indicate that the plasma and cytosolic forms of this enzyme are encoded by different genes (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W.

Several lines of evidence indicate that monocyte-derived macrophages are a major source of plasma PAF acetylhydrolase. Messenger RNA for the plasma PAF acetylhydrolase is induced and a large amount of this activity is secreted when human monocytes differentiate to macrophages (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W.

Chem. 1989; 264: 8467-8470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the properties of the macrophage-secreted PAF acetylhydrolase are identical to those of the plasma form, and the secreted enzyme is recognized by an antibody raised against the purified plasma PAF acetylhydrolase (15Stafforini D.M. Elstad M.R. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9682-9687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, monocyte-derived macrophages clearly secrete the plasma form of PAF acetylhydrolase. Tjoelker et al. (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S.

The encoded protein is composed of 441 amino acid residues with a catalytic triad GXSXG, which is conserved in neutral lipases and serine esterases. Plasma PAF acetylhydrolase dramatically reduces the inflammatory action of PAF both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this enzyme plays an important role in the regulation of PAF levels in blood and tissues (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Moreover, PAF acetylhydrolase also catalyzes the hydrolysis of oxidatively fragmented phospholipids, which have been detected in oxidized low density lipoprotein and have been shown to be mitogenic and inflammatory under certain circumstances (17Heery J.M. Kozak M. Stafforini D.M. Zimmerman D.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore, PAF acetylhydrolase may protect against oxidative damage. The secretion of PAF acetylhydrolase activity has been shown to be regulated by many cytokines and hormones in cultured macrophages and hepatocytes. Previously, we showed that HepG2 cells and primary cultures of hepatocytes secrete PAF acetylhydrolase activity (although at relatively low levels compared with macrophages) (18Tarbet E.B. Safforini D.M. Elstad M.R. Zimmerman G.A. MacIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 286: 16667-16673Google Scholar). We found no substantial effect of dexamethasone on the secretion of this activity by hepatocytes, while Narahara et al. (19Narahara H. Frenkel R.A. Johnston M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that dexamethasone increases secretion from HL-60 cells that have differentiated to macrophages. In addition, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin (IL) 1α, IL1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) reduced the secretion from decidual macrophages (20Narahara H. Johnston J.M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1993; 169: 531-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was observed that estrogen administration to animals decreased PAF acetylhydrolase secretion (21Yasuda K. Johnston J.M. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In in vitro studies, however, the effect depended on the cell type; estrogen reduced the secretion from HepG2 cells but had no effect on differentiated HL-60 cells (18Tarbet E.B. Safforini D.M. Elstad M.R. Zimmerman G.A. MacIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 286: 16667-16673Google Scholar, 19Narahara H. Frenkel R.A. Johnston M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another regulator of PAF acetylhydrolase expression is its substrate. Satohet al. (22Satoh K. Imaizumi T.A. Kawamura Y. Yoshida H. Hiramoto M. Takamatsu S. Takamatsu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showed that PAF, but not the product of the reaction, lysoPAF, stimulated the secretion of PAF acetylhydrolase from HepG2 cells. In summary, previous studies have shown that macrophages secrete high levels of PAF acetylhydrolase activity, which can be influenced by inflammatory mediators. However, the regulatory mechanism was not examined in any of the published studies. One of the most dramatic examples of regulation of PAF acetylhydrolase synthesis is during the differentiation from monocytes to macrophages. Low levels of PAF acetylhydrolase mRNA were detected in isolated human monocytes by Northern analysis. In contrast, large amounts were detected once these cells differentiated to macrophages (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This agreed with a previous report, in which the enzymatic activity was shown to increase during the maturation process (15Stafforini D.M. Elstad M.R. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9682-9687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAF acetylhydrolase mRNA also was expressed differentially among tissues; it was highly expressed in tonsil and placenta but not in a number of others (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Taken together, the above results strongly suggest that plasma PAF acetylhydrolase is regulated in a tissue- and differentiation-dependent manner. We report here the cloning of a 3.5-kb 5′ genomic fragment of the plasma PAF acetylhydrolase gene. We demonstrate that this fragment exhibits various levels of promoter activity in monocytic and macrophagic cell lines, and characterized the basic features of this promoter. Furthermore, we found that LPS and interferon γ (IFNγ) inhibit the promoter activity while PAF stimulates it. Hexadecyl-2-[3H-acetyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. 1-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAF) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). All chemicals and reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. All of the human and murine cytokines were from R&D Systems. PAF antagonists BN52021 and CV3988 were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml) was obtained from Amersham Life Science. Cell culture reagents and restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. except where specified. The monkey kidney cell line COS-7, human monocytic cell line U937, and mouse macrophage cell lines RAW264.7 and P388D1 were from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The human embryonic kidney cell line 293 that was stably transfected with the PAF receptor, and the rabbit anti-plasma PAF acetylhydrolase antibody were provided by ICOS Corp. (Bothell, WA). The mouse monoclonal antibody against actin was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). A human λ genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with a32P-labeled SmaI-KpnI cDNA fragment containing 277 bp of the 5′ end of the cDNA sequence. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming, and hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 16 h. Positive plaques were detected by autoradiography. The λ DNA insert in one of the positive plaques was subcloned into pBluescript (SK), and Southern analysis was performed to identify regions containing exon 1. A 3.5-kbNotI-BamHI genomic fragment hybridized with the exon 1 probe, and then was subcloned into pBluescript and termed pDS. A human RNA master blot was purchased from CLONTECH. The amount of poly(A)+ RNA from different tissues on this blot was normalized for eight housekeeping genes by the manufacturer. A human plasma PAF acetylhydrolase cDNA clone (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) was linearized bySmaI digestion, and the 2.3-kb fragment was purified and used as template for RNA probe preparation. The antisense RNA was synthesized and labeled with the DIG RNA-labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) by an in vitro transcription reaction. The generated 1.2-kb antisense RNA probe then was hybridized to the blot following the manufacturer's instructions. The levels of PAF acetylhydrolase mRNA were quantified by scanning using Photoshop software and analyzed using NIH Image. The 5′ end of an antisense oligonucleotide RAH+40, was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) and purified through a NucTrap probe purification column (Stratagene). The primer extension reaction was performed using an AMV (avian myeloblastosis virus) reverse transcriptase primer extension kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. The product was analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Various lengths of 5′ genomic fragments were prepared by restriction digestion of pDS, and then ligated into a luciferase reporter vector pGL3basic (Promega). Constructs A and B contain the longest insertion and were generated by digesting pDS with SmaI and NotI, filling protruding ends with Klenow, and inserting into the SmaI site of pGL3basic. The promoter direction is the same as that of the reporter gene in construct A and the opposite direction in construct B. Construct C was made by digestion of pDS with HindIII and insertion into theHindIII site of pGL3basic. The promoter direction is the same as that of the reporter construct. Construct D has the same insert as construct C but the opposite orientation. Construct E was prepared in two steps; pDS was digested with PstI, and the generated 1.15-kb fragment was inserted into pBluescript. The resulting plasmid was cut by BamHI and HindIII and then ligated into pGL3basic previously digested with BglII and HindIII. Construct F was made by digestion of pDS with EarI and EcoRV. The resulting 1-kbEarI-EcoRV fragment was purified and ligated intoSmaI-digested pGL3basic. Construct G was prepared byEcoRI digestion of pDS followed by Klenow fill-in, and the 650-bp fragment was purified and inserted into SmaI-digested pGL3basic. Constructs H and I were derived from construct C: construct C was digested with XhoI and the 5.3-kb fragment was purified and self-ligated to generate construct H. Construct I was made in a similar way as construct H except KpnI was used instead of XhoI. Construct J was generated by EcoRI digestion of construct C, and the 5.9-kb fragment was purified and self-ligated. The identity and the orientation of the constructs were verified by multiple restriction mapping and partial sequencing. COS-7 and RAW264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). U937 and P388D1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% and 15% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Transfection in COS-7 and RAW264.7 cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). One μg of promoter construct DNA, and 1 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase control plasmid (Promega) were cotransfected into ∼ 4 × 105cells. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined with assay kits from Promega and Tropix, Inc. (Bedford, MA), respectively. Transfection of U937 and P388D1 cells was conducted by electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 300 V and 960 microfarads. Fifteen μg of promoter construct and 10 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase DNA were cotransfected into ∼ 7 × 106 cells, which were harvested after 17 h. The luciferase and β-galactosidase activity assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Secreted PAF acetylhydrolase activity was assessed by collecting conditioned medium and then determined directly as described (23Stafforini D.M. MacIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 344-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from macrophages using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The first strand of cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR reaction was carried out using two primers, which amplify a 562-bp cDNA fragment in the PAF acetylhydrolase coding sequence. The intensity of the DNA bands was quantitated and normalized to the intensity of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase bands. The quantitation was performed as described above. Macrophages were lysed with CHAPS lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 16 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Fifty μg of protein were loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blots were carried out as described (24Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal plasma PAF acetylhydrolase antibody was used as the primary antibody. The secondary antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Life Science). The immunodetection was performed using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham). The intensity of the bands was quantified as described above. Nuclear extracts from monocytes and macrophages were prepared as described previously (25Weyrich A.S. McIntyre T.M. McEver R.P. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide probes were chemically synthesized and then were annealed in STE buffer at 100 °C for 10 min and slowly cooled down to room temperature. The annealed, double-stranded oligonucleotides were separated from the single-stranded oligonucleotides on a 5% low melt agarose gel. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were purified by phenol extraction of the recovered fragment. The probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and then separated from free [γ-32P]ATP through a NucTrap probe purification column. The binding reaction was performed using a gel shift assay system from Promega. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated with ∼ 50,000 cpm of radioactive probe. The bound products then were analyzed on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR films (Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight at −70 °C. Our original studies using Northern blot analysis (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) did not detect mRNA for the plasma form of PAF acetylhydrolase in liver, which conflicted with studies that observed secretion of the activity by cultured hepatocytes (18Tarbet E.B. Safforini D.M. Elstad M.R. Zimmerman G.A. MacIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 286: 16667-16673Google Scholar, 22Satoh K. Imaizumi T.A. Kawamura Y. Yoshida H. Hiramoto M. Takamatsu S.

Exp. 1993; 42: 672-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the mRNA expression with a more sensitive method and a more extensive sample of tissue mRNAs. This experiment (Fig.1) revealed that there is widespread expression of the mRNA for PAF acetylhydrolase but that the levels differed by as much as 4-fold. The mRNA was expressed in all parts of the brain, but at low levels except for hippocampus, which had the highest expression of the brain tissues. The tissues with the highest levels of expression included ovary, placenta, liver, lymph node, and thyroid gland in adult, and the spleen in the fetus. The lung had a lower, but easily detectable, amount. Thus, this experiment confirmed most of the previously reported pattern but, significantly, identified the liver as a potential source. This widespread distribution is consistent with two interpretations; either many cell types express the mRNA for PAF acetylhydrolase, or one cell type that is found in many tissues expresses it. The latter seemed more probable because we had found previously that macrophages, which are in all tissues, secrete high levels of enzyme activity. However, endothelial cells also are found in most organs, but we found no mRNA and no secretion of the PAF acetylhydrolase activity from endothelial cells (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the expression of PAF acetylhydrolase in many tissues is most likely the result of expression in tissue macrophages. In the studies reported here, we focused on the regulation of PAF acetylhydrolase expression in macrophages. Several cytokines have been shown to alter the levels of PAF acetylhydrolase activity in vivo, and in somein vitro studies. To determine the basis for this response, we examined the PAF acetylhydrolase activity secreted by monocyte-derived macrophages with or without cytokine treatment. Compared with cells without treatment, cells that were treated with IFNα, IL1α, IL4, IL6, TNFα, GM-CSF (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor), M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor), IFNγ, and LPS all secreted less PAF acetylhydrolase activity, although the effect was modest in most cases (data not shown). We also measured the intracellular activity in the same samples to ensure that the effect on the extracellular activity did not result just from an inhibition of the secretory process; the intracellular levels paralleled (but were more pronounced than) the changes observed in the supernatant, indicating that the effect of cytokines was to decrease the synthesis of PAF acetylhydrolase (data not shown). IFNγ and LPS caused the most marked inhibition on PAF acetylhydrolase secretion by 25% and 34%, respectively. These two cytokines have been shown to synergistically stimulate the expression of the nitric oxide synthase in a macrophage cell line (27Lorsbach R.B. Murphy W.J. Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1908-1913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This prompted us to test the effect of IFNγ and LPS in combination. Macrophages were incubated with IFNγ, LPS, or IFNγ plus LPS for 24 h, and the secreted PAF acetylhydrolase activity was determined. The combined treatment resulted in a 25% reduction of the secreted activity, which is the same level as that observed using IFNγ alone (data not shown). Therefore, there was no synergistic or additive effect of IFNγ and LPS on PAF acetylhydrolase expression. To further examine the level at which the negative regulation by LPS and IFNγ is exerted, we measured the amounts of PAF acetylhydrolase protein and mRNA in cytokine-treated, and control, macrophages. Twenty-four hours after the addition of IFNγ, the levels of mRNA decreased by about 40% (Fig.2 A) and levels of the protein by 50% (Fig. 2 B). The levels of PAF acetylhydrolase mRNA decreased to similar levels after LPS treatment (data not shown). These results indicated that the most likely mechanism for the inhibition was an effect on transcription, which we tested in the experiments below. In addition to cytokines, the substrate of the enzyme, PAF, has been shown to regulate the synthesis of PAF acetylhydrolase although in the opposite direction, stimulation, and only hepatocytes have been examined (18Tarbet E.B.

Takamatsu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For example, Satoh et al. (22Satoh K. Imaizumi T.A. Kawamura Y. Yoshida H. Hiramoto M. Takamatsu S. Takamatsu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) found that PAF stimulated PAF acetylhydrolase secretion by HepG2 cells by 5-fold. To explore the mechanism for this, we first asked whether PAF had the same effect on monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that treatment of cultured macrophages with PAF (1 μm) increased PAF acetylhydrolase secretion by 47%. The activity in the medium under control conditions was 0.20 μmol/ml/h, and increased to 0.29 μmol/ml/h when PAF was supplemented to the medium for 24 h. Moreover, PAF antagonists BN52021 and CV3988 almost completely blocked the stimulation; the levels of th"

These glycans are required for the adhesive interactions that allow this adhesion receptor-counterreceptor pair to facilitate leukocyte extravasation. To begin to understand the biosynthesis of these glycans, we have characterized the acceptor and site specificities of the two granulocyte α1,3-fucosyltransferases, Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII, using recombinant forms of these two enzymes and a panel of synthetic polylactosamine-based acceptors. We find that Fuc-TIV can transfer fucose effectively to all N-acetyllactosamine (LN) units in neutral polylactosamines, and to the “inner” LN units of α2,3-sialylated acceptors but is ineffective in transfer to the distal α2,3-sialylated LN unit in α2,3-sialylated acceptors. Fuc-TVII, by contrast, effectively fucosylates only the distal α2,3-sialylated LN unit in α2,3-sialylated acceptors and thus exhibits an acceptor site-specificity that is complementary to Fuc-TIV. Furthermore, the consecutive action of Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII, in vitro, can convert the long chain sialoglycan SAα2–3′LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3′LN (where SA is sialic acid) into the trifucosylated molecule SAα2–3′Lexβ1–3′Lexβ1–3′Lex (where Lex is the trisaccharide Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc) known to decorate PSGL-1. The complementary in vitro acceptor site-specificities of Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII imply that these enzymes cooperate in vivo in the biosynthesis of monosialylated, multifucosylated polylactosamine components of selectin counterreceptors on human leukocytes.

Fuc-TVII, by contrast, effectively fucosylates only the distal α2,3-sialylated LN unit in α2,3-sialylated acceptors and thus exhibits an acceptor site-specificity that is complementary to Fuc-TIV. Furthermore, the consecutive action of Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII, in vitro, can convert the long chain sialoglycan SAα2–3′LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3′LN (where SA is sialic acid) into the trifucosylated molecule SAα2–3′Lexβ1–3′Lexβ1–3′Lex (where Lex is the trisaccharide Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc) known to decorate PSGL-1. The complementary in vitro acceptor site-specificities of Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII imply that these enzymes cooperate in vivo in the biosynthesis of monosialylated, multifucosylated polylactosamine components of selectin counterreceptors on human leukocytes. Extravasation of leukocytes is initiated by interactions between the selectin family of cell adhesion molecules and their glycoprotein counterreceptors, leading in turn to vascular shear flow-dependent rolling of leukocytes on endothelial cell surfaces (1Ley K.

To begin to address the relative roles of Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII in the biosynthesis of these multifucosylated molecules, we have used recombinant forms of these enzymes (7Lowe J.B.

Acceptor site specificities derived from a panel of synthetic polylactosamine precursors imply that Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII exhibit distinct acceptor specificities, as observed previously (7Lowe J.B.

Specifically, we find that Fuc-TIV preferentially fucosylates “inner” LN units on α2,3-sialyl polylactosamine chains, whereas Fuc-TVII preferentially fucosylates distal LN units on such α2,3-sialylated polylactosamine precursors. These observations demonstrate alternative, and complementary substrate site-specificities for Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII, and imply that this pair of enzymes catalyzes the synthesis of polyfucosylated selectin ligands in leukocytes through complementary catalytic activities. The transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing human Fuc-TIV or Fuc-TVII has been described previously (7Lowe J.B. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Nair R.P. Larsen R.D. Marks R.M.

The structures of the oligosaccharide acceptors are shown in Fig. 1. Glycan 1 was from Sigma and glycan 2 from Oxford Glycosystems (Abingdon, UK). The others, we synthesized enzymatically. Briefly, glycan11 was constructed from GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1-OMe (Sigma) by β1,4-galactosylation (19Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The intermediates as well as the final product were isolated in pure form; 1H-NMR-spectrum of11 at 500 MHz confirmed its structure; matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) revealed that the sample was pure and had the expected molecular weight (M+Na)+ m/z 948.0 (calc. 947.9).

MALDI-TOF MS of the resulting octasaccharide LNβ1–3′Lexβ1-3′Lex gave (M+Na)+ m/z 1429.3 (calc. 1429.3). The octasaccharide was finally α2,3-sialylated to give glycan 8. The NMR spectrum of glycan 8 is shown in Fig. 4; a comparison with the spectrum of the unsialylated precursor is presented in Table I. Degradation of glycan 8 by sialidase and a mixture of β-galactosidase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase gave the neutral hexasaccharide [14C]Fucα1–3LNβ1–3′[14C]Fucα1–3LN, which chromatographed like an authentic marker on paper.

Glycan 6, in turn, was obtained by α1,3-fucosylating glycan 9 at the LN unit by human milk α1,3/4-Fuc-Ts. The product was then β1,4-galactosylated and finally α2,3-sialylated.

N-Acetyllactosamine (LN; glycan1) and sialyl N-acetyllactosamine (SAα2–3′LN; glycan 2) served as reference acceptors for Fuc-TIV- and Fuc-TVII-dependent reactions, respectively. Fuc-TIV rapidly fucosylates LN (glycan 1) but is ineffective in its ability to fucosylate the sialylated acceptors 2, 6, and8, each of which can be fucosylated only at the distal, sialylated LN unit (Fig. 1). By contrast, Fuc-TVII effectively fucosylates all sialopolylactosamines tested except glycan 5, which can be fucosylated only on an internal LN unit (Fig. 1). The neutral glycans9-15 are efficiently fucosylated by Fuc-TIV but are poor acceptors when tested with Fuc-TVII. Thus, human Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII show gross differences in their acceptor specificities as implied from previous studies using much smaller acceptors (7Lowe J.B. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Nair R.P.

Fuc-TIV also efficiently fucosylates the sialylated linear acceptors3 and 4, each of which contain “inner”N-acetyllactosamine residues. Furthermore, Fuc-TIV effectively utilizes sialylated, fucosylated linear acceptors5 and 7, each of which also contain unoccupied “inner” N-acetyllactosamine residues. To determine which of the different GlcNAc residues were fucosylated in the sialylated multisite acceptors 3 and 4, the products were degraded by sialidase and then by mixed β-galactosidase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. The latter digestion removes any fucose-free LN units from the nonreducing end of desialylated polylactosamines but is unable to act on distal, α1,3-fucosylated LN residues (30Arakawa M. Ogata S.-I. Muramatsu T. Kobata A. J. Biochem. 1974; 75: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hence, the desialylated chains were shortened in a way that established the position of the α1,3-fucosylated LN residue. Products of these digestions were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were used to derive the site specificity data displayed in Fig. 1. Fuc-TIV transfers rapidly to sialoglycan 4, at both inner LN units (residues 1 and 2 in Fig. 1) but transfers to the sialylated LN unit (residue 3) at a rate 30–40 times slower (Fig. 1 and Fig.2 A). In contrast, Fuc-TVII transfers preferentially to the sialylated, distal LN residue of acceptor 4 (Fig. 2 B); the rate of transfer to the middle LN unit (residue 2) and to the reducing end LN unit (residue 1) were, respectively, 17 and 84 times slower than transfer to the sialylated LN residue (Fig. 1). The structural data inferred from the chromatograms in Fig. 2 were confirmed by degrading fucosylated products derived from glycan 4 by sialidase treatment, followed by digestion with endo-β-galactosidase, which cleaves internal β-galactosidic linkages of linear polylactosamines, but is unable to hydrolyze the same bonds of α1,3-fucosylated LN units (31de Vries T. Norberg T. Lönn H. van den Eijnden D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,32de Vries T. van den Eijnden D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9937-9944Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The fucosylated products of sialoglycan 3 were analyzed in a similar way to ascertain site specificity of fucosylation. These analyses indicate that Fuc-TIV overwhelmingly fucosylates at the inner LN unit, whereas Fuc-TVII fucosylates preferentially at the distal, sialylated LN unit (Fig. 1; data not shown). Taken together, these results imply that “internal” fucosylation events occurring within sialoglycans are catalyzed by Fuc-TIV, whereas the terminal fucosylation event that creates sialyl Lewis x (sLex) type products is catalyzed by Fuc-TVII. In vitro assays using the prefucosylated glycans 5 and6 indicate that Fuc-TIV transfers fucose to the inner LN unit and that Fuc-TVII transfers to the sialylated, distal LN unit (Fig. 1). Hence, the two enzymes complement each other efficiently in the synthesis of the sialylated, bifucosylated epitope from the fucose-free precursor via intermediates of VIM-2 and sLex type glycans. The unlabeled glycan SAα2–3′LNβ1–3′Lexβ1–3′LN (7) was synthesized in nanomolar amounts as specified under “Experimental Procedures” and was then used as an acceptor in a Fuc-TIV-dependent reaction. Structural characterization of the products (Fig. 3) revealed that 86% of the [14C]fucose was transferred to the “innermost” LN unit (residue 1), generating SAα2–3′LNβ1–3′Lexβ1–3′[14C]Lex (glycan8). Less than 5% of the fucose transfer occurred at the sialylated LN unit (residue 3). These observations, together with those displayed in Fig. 2 A, demonstrate that Fuc-TIV can convert glycan 4 into the bifucosylated glycan 8. The nonasaccharide SAα2–3′LNβ1–3′Lexβ1–3′Lex (8) was synthesized in nanomolar amounts as specified under “Experimental Procedures”; its structure was confirmed by NMR (Fig.4 and TableI), and the radiolabeled molecule was used as an acceptor in either a Fuc-TVII-dependent reaction or Fuc-TIV-dependent reaction. Fuc-TVII was found to fucosylate glycan 8 nearly as rapidly as glycan 2(Fig. 1) to yield as a major product SAα2–3′[14C]Lexβ1–3′Lexβ1–3′Lex (Fig.5 A). Fuc-TIV was found to be competent to construct the identical product but only at a rate that represents 6–7% of the rate catalyzed by Fuc-TVII (Fig.5 B). Considered together, the efficient conversion of glycan4 to glycan 8 in two steps catalyzed by Fuc-TIV, but not by Fuc-TVII, and the further rapid Fuc-TVII-dependent conversion of glycan 8 to SAα2–3′Lexβ1–3′Lexβ1–3′Lex, demonstrate that the monosialylated, fucose-free tri-lactosamine chain (4) can be converted into the sialyl-triLex product by the complementary actions of the two α1,3-fucosyltransferases present in human leukocytes. Fuc-TIV efficiently fucosylated GNβ1–3′LN (9), representing a growing lactosamine chain (Fig. 1), whereas Fuc-TVII did not utilize this acceptor. Fucosylation occurred only at the reducing end N-acetylglucosamine moiety, as the14C-fucosylated product was cleaved by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase to [14C]Lex (data not shown). Fuc-TIV also transferred effectively to LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3Gβ1-OMe (11), most rapidly (67%) to the middle LN unit (residue 2 in Fig. 1) and more slowly (33%) to the terminal LN unit (Fig. 6 A). For comparison, initial transfer to glycan 10 occurred in 61% of the molecules at residue 1 and in 39% of the molecules at residue 2 (data not shown). When the hexasaccharide LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3′LN (glycan 12) was used with Fuc-TIV, 28% of the initial fucosylation occurred at the reducing end LN unit, 47% occurred at the middle LN unit, and 25% occurred at the nonreducing end LN unit (Fig. 6 B). Fuc-TIV also transferred rapidly to the prefucosylated glycans Lexβ1–3′LN (13) and LNβ1–3′Lex (14), confirming that fucosylation of vicinal LN units is feasible. Fuc-TIV transferred in a slightly preferential manner to the β1,3-branch of glycan 15 and Fuc-TVII did likewise with sialyl glycan 16 (Fig. 1; data not shown). Neither enzyme transferred to the branch-bearing LN unit (residue 1 in Fig. 1) in their acceptors (data not shown). By using lysates of appropriately transfected CHO cells (7Lowe J.B.

https://openalex.org/W2076984034,"Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is a hematopoietic growth factor that is released by osteoblasts and is recognized to play a critical role in bone remodeling in vivo and in vitro. CSF-1 is synthesized as a soluble or cell-surface protein. It is unclear, however, whether human osteoblasts express both molecular forms of CSF-1, and whether these isoforms can independently mediate osteoclastogenesis. In the present study, using a combination of quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and Western immunoblot analysis, we have demonstrated that human osteoblast-like cells as well as primary human osteoblasts express the cell-surface form of CSF-1 both constitutively and in response to parathyroid hormone and tumor necrosis factor. Furthermore, using an in vitro co-culture system, we have shown that cell-surface CSF-1 alone is sufficient to support osteoclast formation. These findings may be especially significant in view of evidence that direct cell-to-cell contact is critical for osteoclast formation, and suggest that differential regulation of expression of the CSF-1 isoforms may influence osteoclast function modulated by osteotropic hormones.

The precise mechanism whereby osteoblasts mediate osteoclastic bone resorption is unclear. One widely held hypothesis is that activated osteoblasts secrete cytokines that directly or indirectly influence osteoclast formation or function (1Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Udagawa N. Sasaki T.

A combination of nucleotide sequence analysis and transfection studies indicates that two distinct CSF-1 protein products are encoded by these transcripts. Both primary translation products are membrane-bound glycoproteins that are released by proteolysis (16Rettenmier C.W. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 149: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 1.6- and 3.0-kb CSF-1 cDNAs, however, give rise by alternative splicing to a short exon 6, yielding a cell-surface or membrane-bound form of CSF-1, which lacks a proteolytic cleavage site and is therefore slowly and inefficiently released by extracellular proteolysis (15Pampfer S.

Whether the molecular forms of CSF-1 differ in their physiologic effects is, however, still unclear.It is well recognized that osteoblasts synthesize and release the soluble form of CSF-1 both constitutively and in response to osteotropic agents, (9Weir E.

Physiol. 1996; 166: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but the physiologic relevance of these observations is unclear. Specifically, it is unknown whether primary human osteoblasts or osteoblast-like cells express cell-surface CSF-1. Additionally, although PTH and TNF have been shown to increase expression of the soluble form of CSF-1 in osteoblasts (9Weir E. Horowitz M. Baron R. Centrella M. Kacinski B. Insogna K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Kaplan D.L. Eielson C.M. Horowitz M.C. Insogna K.L. Weir E.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether they regulate expression of the cell-surface form of CSF-1. Finally, it is unknown whether cell-surface CSF-1 expressed in osteoblasts has any physiologic role in bone remodeling.In the present study, using a combination of quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and flow cytometry, we have shown that primary human osteoblasts and osteoblast-like cells express mRNA and protein species consistent with the cell-surface form of CSF-1, and that expression is regulated by PTH and TNF. In addition, we report that the cell-surface form of CSF-1 supports the formation of multinucleated osteoclast-like cells in an in vitro co-culture system.DISCUSSIONAlthough CSF-1 is derived from a single-copy gene, there is considerable heterogeneity in protein size and structure due to a combination of alternative mRNA splicing, glycosylation, and proteolytic processing (37Shadle P.J. Aldwin L. Nitecki D.E. Koths K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 40: 91-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The multiple CSF-1 mRNA species identified in human and murine tissues arise as a result of alternative splicing in exon 6 and the alternative use of exons 9 and 10 in the 3′-untranslated region of the gene. The exon 9/10 splice variation gives rise to mRNA species that theoretically have varying stability due to the inclusion or exclusion of AU instability motifs (12Ladner M.B. Martin G.A. Noble J.A. Nikoloff D.M. Tal T. Kawasaki E.S. White T.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2693-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing in exon 6 yields membrane-bound precursors that differ in the rate and efficiency of cleavage from the cell membrane (16Rettenmier C.W. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 149: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Five CSF-1 cDNAs have been cloned, ranging in size from 1.6 to 4.0 kb. All of these share the same exons 1–5, 7, and 8, whereas the 1.6- and 3.0-kb cDNAs have a short version of exon 6 in which the site for proteolytic cleavage of the CSF-1 presursor has been spliced out (11Kawasaki E.S.

Thus, the product of the 1.6- and 3.0-kb cDNAs are membrane-bound glycoproteins that are slowly and inefficiently cleaved from the cell surface (15Pampfer S. Tabibzadeh S. Chuan F.C. Pollard J.W.

Biol. 1987; 7: 2378-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). By contrast, the products of the 1.9-, 2.3-, and 4.0-kb cDNAs have intermediate or long versions of exon 6 in which the proteolytic cleavage site is intact, giving rise to a soluble, rapidly secreted growth factor (11Kawasaki E.S.

Several human and murine cell lines and tissues have been shown to express a variety of CSF-1 mRNA species, consistent with the soluble and cell-surface forms of CSF-1. Detailed analysis of these transcripts, of the CSF-1 protein isoforms that they encode, and of the factors that regulate their expression has, however, been limited, and their bioactivity and physiologic relevance is unclear.We have reported previously that mouse and rat osteoblasts express a major 4-kb CSF-1 mRNA species and several smaller, less abundant transcripts (9Weir E. Horowitz M. Baron R. Centrella M. Kacinski B. Insogna K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Kaplan D.L. Eielson C.M. Horowitz M.C. Insogna K.L. Weir E.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). While the 4-kb species is consistent with the cDNA encoding the soluble form of CSF-1, the nature of the smaller transcripts is unclear. In the present study, we have shown by RT-PCR analysis that primary human osteoblasts and osteoblast-like cell lines constitutively express mRNA species consistent with the soluble and cell-surface forms of CSF-1. In addition, using quantitative RT-PCR, we have demonstrated that treatment of osteoblastic cells with PTH and TNF increases expression of both isoforms. Since PCR amplification is an exponential process, sample to sample variation in quantity of input RNA, in conversion of RNA to DNA, or in amplification efficiency can affect the yield of the PCR product. We therefore chose a method for quantitative PCR that attempted to deal with each of these potential limitations (30Jin C.-F. Mata M. Fink D.J. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 3: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To control for variability in the amount of input RNA and in the efficiency of its conversion to cDNA, we used human GAPDH as an endogenous standard. To control for variability inherent in the amplification process, we constructed external standards that shared with the target sequence the same primer sites and most of the amplified sequence. Thus, the two templates competed for the same primer pair and amplified at the same rate, ensuring accurate relative quantitation. RT-PCR analysis appears to be required to detect cell-surface CSF-1 mRNA, since Northern analysis using region-specific probes was unable to identify RNA species for this form of CSF-1 (data not shown), indicating that the cell-surface form is present at lower levels than the soluble form. This finding is not unexpected, since the turnover rate of cell-surface CSF-1 protein on the cell membrane is slow, as compared with the soluble form, which is rapidly secreted and thus likely requires a higher rate of transcription (17Rettenmier C.W. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Ralph P. Price K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2378-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since the effector function of cell-surface CSF-1 is mediated locally by direct interaction with adjacent receptor-bearing cells, it is likely that the minimum concentration required for bioactivity is less than that of the soluble form, which is secreted and mediates its effector function(s) at distant sites.In addition to demonstrating regulated expression of mRNA transcripts encoding the cell-surface form of CSF-1, the present study shows that osteoblasts express cell-surface CSF-1 protein. Thus, flow cytometric analysis revealed that MG63 cells constitutively express cell-surface CSF-1, and that expression is increased by TNF treatment. While untreated Saos-2 cells showed only modest expression of cell-surface CSF-1 protein, expression was enhanced by PTH. The low constitutive expression of cell-surface CSF-1 protein in these cells appears to conflict with the results of RT-PCR. This may, however, represent differences in the sensitivity of the two techniques. Results of Western analysis also confirmed that both MG63 and Saos-2 cells produce the cell-surface form of CSF-1, both constitutively and in response to PTH and TNF. The 32- and 35-kDa species that were detected in partially purified human osteoblast cell membranes are consistent with the 30-kDa species previously detected in membrane extracts from murine osteoblasts (27Felix R. Halasy-Nagy J. Wetterwald A. Cecchini M.G. Fleisch H. Hofstetter W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and with the 31- and 34-kDa species detected in cell lysates prepared from NIH3T3 cells transfected with cDNA encoding the cell-surface form of CSF-1 (17Rettenmier C.W. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Ralph P. Price K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2378-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As was shown in the transfected cells, it is likely that the two protein species detected in osteoblast membranes exhibit differing degrees of glycosylation. Since the soluble form of CSF-1 is rapidly released from cell membranes, protein species consistent with this form were not detected in osteoblast membranes by Western analysis, further suggesting a role for osteoblastic cell-surface CSF-1 in the immediate bone microenvironment. While the increase in CSF-1 protein levels associated with PTH and TNF treatment appears to be less than the induction of CSF-1 mRNA expression, this is likely to reflect differences in techniques used to evaluate levels of mRNA versusprotein. RT-PCR is an exquisitely sensitive technique with a large dynamic range, whereas both flow cytometry and Western analysis are less quantitative, primarily because they are highly dependent on such factors as the affinity and specificity of the antibody. Additionally, we cannot rule out induction of nontranslated mRNA or rapid degradation of mRNA.In support of the physiologic relevance of our observations in osteoblastic cell lines, we also demonstrated that primary human osteoblasts express mRNA species for cell-surface CSF-1 and that TNF enhances its expression to a degree comparable to that seen in TNF-treated MG63 cells. In contrast to Saos-2 cells, however, PTH caused no up-regulation of cell-surface or soluble CSF-1 in primary osteoblasts. While the cause of this apparent discrepancy is unclear, other investigators have also reported differences in PTH-induced cytokine production among osteoblast cell lines and primary osteoblasts (28Elias J.A. Tang W. Horowitz M.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 489-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the primary reason for the difference in PTH response between the Saos-2 cells and primary osteoblasts is most likely the weak PTH-induced cAMP response in the latter. We have performed adenylate cyclase assays using primary osteoblasts prepared from a number of patients, and have found little induction of cAMP in response to PTH-(1–34). Thus since, as shown in Fig. 3 C, PTH induction of CSF-1 expression in Saos-2 cells appears to be cAMP-dependent, it is not surprising that osteoblasts that exhibit a weak PTH-induced cAMP response fail to demonstrate PTH-induced CSF-1 expression. While weak PTH-induced cyclase activity in primary human osteoblasts has been reported previously (38Gehron Robey P. Termine J.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 39Civitelli R. Bacskai B.J. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Adams S.R. Avioli L.V. Tsien R.Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the precise reason is unclear. It is well recognized that the degree of differentiation of osteoblasts influences expression of the PTH receptor (40Rouleau M.F. Mitchell J. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and it is likely that the age of patients from which our osteoblasts are prepared (i.e. adults), or the method of cell preparation (i.e. explant culture) may affect the degree of differentiation and PTH receptor expression. Additionally, the osteoblast preparation is a mixed population of cells, most likely representing cells at varying degree of differentiation and with varying PTH receptor expression. Thus, the specific proportion of each cell type in each preparation affects the PTH response.While others have reported that mouse osteoblasts express the cell-surface form of CSF-1 (27Felix R. Halasy-Nagy J. Wetterwald A. Cecchini M.G. Fleisch H. Hofstetter W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Elias J.A. Tang W. Horowitz M.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 489-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our observation that PTH and TNF regulate its expression in human osteoblast-like cells suggests that this isoform of CSF-1 may play a role in TNF-induced, and possibly PTH-induced, bone resorption. We and others have suggested previously that CSF-1 increases osteoclastogenesis in PTH- and TNF-induced resorption (9Weir E. Horowitz M. Baron R. Centrella M. Kacinski B. Insogna K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23Felix R. Fleisch H. Elford P.R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1989; 44: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Kaplan D.L. Eielson C.M. Horowitz M.C. Insogna K.L. Weir E.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but it is unclear from previous studies whether both the soluble and cell-surface forms are involved. Takahashiet al. (41Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Akatsu T. Tanaka H. Isogai Y. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1792-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) observed that when osteoblasts from op/op mice were co-cultured with splenocytes, pharmacologic amounts of CSF-1 were required to support osteoclast formation, and other studies have shown that much higher concentrations of soluble CSF-1 are required to induce osteoclastogenesis in metatarsals from op/op mice than in metatarsals/metacarpals from normal mice (7Antonioli-Corboz V. Cecchini M.G. Felix R. Fleisch H. van der Pluijm G. Lowik C.W.G.M. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42Morohashi T. Antonioli-Corboz V. Fleisch H. Cecchini M.G. Felix R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cell-surface CSF-1, either alone or in addition to soluble CSF-1, might be required for osteoclastogenesis. Takahashi also observed that, using an osteoblast/splenocyte co-culture system, osteoblasts failed to support osteoclast formation when separated from precursors by a membrane filter, further suggesting that an osteoblast-derived cell-surface moiety is necessary for target cell activation (1Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Udagawa N. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2600-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Consistent with these hypotheses, in the present study, we have shown that glutaraldehyde-fixed NIH3T3 cells transfected with cDNA encoding the cell-surface form of CSF-1 support formation of OCLs in an in vitro co-culture system. By contrast, parental NIH3T3 cells, or cells transfected with a truncated cDNA for cell-surface CSF-1 that does not bind to the cell membrane, failed to support formation of OCLs. Interestingly, we also demonstrated that NIH3T3 cells transfected with cell-surface CSF-1 failed to support osteoclast formation in the absence of op/op osteoblasts, indicating that cell-surface CSF-1 alone does not support osteoclast formation, and that other osteoblast-derived factors are required. Consistent with our results, Stein et al. (19Stein J. Borzillo G.V. Rettenmier C.W. Blood. 1990; 76: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that cell-surface CSF-1 supports the proliferation of mouse mononuclear phagocytes in vitro. Bioactivity of this form of CSF-1 in other tissues known to express it, however, including human uterus and placenta, has not been reported.As in other tissues, the precise roles of the soluble and cell-surface forms of CSF-1 in osteoblasts are unclear. While the absence of osteoclasts in the op/op mouse indicates a key role for CSF-1 in osteoclastogenesis, deficiency of osteoclasts and macrophages reverses with age (43Begg S.K. Radley J.M. Pollard J.W. Chisolm O.T. Stanley E.R. Bertoncello I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is unknown, it has been hypothesized that other cytokines assume the osteoclastogenic function of CSF-1 in mature mice, or that unique, tissue-specific splice variants in the op/op mouse may lead to an incompletely penetrant phenotype and delayed development of the mononuclear system (44Hume D.A. Favot P. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Multiple CSF-1 splice variants are expressed in human and murine tissues, and in many cases their function within a specific tissue is unknown. Likewise, the functional significance of cell-surface CSF-1 in osteoblasts is unclear. Our data, however, which demonstrate regulated expression and bioactivity of cell-surface CSF-1 in bone, suggest that this isoform of CSF-1 interacts via cell-cell"
https://openalex.org/W2021745376,"A tyrosyl radical generated in the peroxidase cycle of prostaglandin H synthase-1 (PGHS-1) can serve as the initial oxidant for arachidonic acid (AA) in the cyclooxygenase reaction. Peroxides also induce radical formation in prostaglandin H synthase-2 (PGHS-2) and in PGHS-1 reconstituted with mangano protoporphyrin IX (MnPGHS-1), but the EPR spectra of these radicals are distinct from the initial tyrosyl radical in PGHS-1. We have examined the ability of the radicals in PGHS-2 and MnPGHS-1 to oxidize AA, using single-turnover EPR studies. One wide singlet tyrosyl radical with an overall EPR line width of 29–31 gauss (G) was generated by reaction of PGHS-2 with ethyl hydroperoxide. Anaerobic addition of AA to PGHS-2 immediately after formation of this radical led to its disappearance and emergence of an AA radical (AA·) with a 7-line EPR, substantiated by experiments using octadeuterated AA. Subsequent addition of oxygen resulted in regeneration of the tyrosyl radical. In contrast, the peroxide-generated radical (a 21G narrow singlet) in a Y371F PGHS-2 mutant lacking cyclooxygenase activity failed to react with AA. The peroxide-generated radical in MnPGHS-1 exhibited a line width of 36–38G, but was also able to convert AA to an AA· with an EPR spectrum similar to that found with PGHS-2. These results indicate that the peroxide-generated radicals in PGHS-2 and MnPGHS-1 can each serve as immediate oxidants of AA to form the same carbon-centered fatty acid radical that subsequently reacts with oxygen to form a hydroperoxide. The EPR data for the AA-derived radical formed by PGHS-2 and MnPGHS-1 could be accounted for by a planar pentadienyl radical with two strongly interacting β-protons at C10 of AA. These results support a functional role for peroxide-generated radicals in cyclooxygenase catalysis by both PGHS isoforms and provide important structural characterization of the carbon-centered AA·.

Although two distinct PGHS isozymes, PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, have been discovered, they are both hemoproteins, and it is assumed that they share the same basic catalytic mechanism (1Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 167-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Smith W.L. Eling T.E. Kulmacz R.J. Marnett L.J. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Both PGHS isozymes have two enzyme activities: a cyclooxygenase activity that converts arachidonic acid to PGG2 and a peroxidase activity that catalyzes the transformation of PGG2 to PGH2 (1Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 167-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hershman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar, 3Smith W.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A branched-chain radical mechanism has been proposed to integrate the two catalytic activities (5Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 6Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this proposal (Scheme FS1), a tyrosyl radical (Fe(IV)Tyr·) is generated by an internal electron transfer in peroxidase Compound I (Fe(V)), shown as Step 2. The cyclooxygenase reaction itself begins when the tyrosyl radical reacts with bound arachidonate (AA) to form a fatty acid radical (Fe(IV)Tyr/AA·), (Step 3). The bound fatty acid radical then reacts with molecular oxygen and rearranges to form a PGG2 radical (Step 4). In the final cyclooxygenase step, the tyrosyl radical is regenerated and PGG2 is released (Step 5). The tyrosyl radical mechanism nicely explains the heme dependence of both enzyme activities and the requirement of the cyclooxygenase for a hydroperoxide activator (3Smith W.L. Eling T.E.

Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3276-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It also is consistent with x-ray crystallographic data that show a tyrosine residue (Tyr-385 in PGHS-1 and Tyr-371 in PGHS-2) positioned between the heme and the arachidonic acid binding channel (8Picot D.

The peroxidase-associated tyrosyl radical in PGHS-1 was shown to react with arachidonic acid to form a carbon-centered radical (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), providing direct evidence for a key step in the proposed tyrosyl radical mechanism (Scheme FS1, Step 3). Peroxides induce a tyrosyl radical in PGHS-2, but its EPR characteristics, a wide-singlet with 29–30 gauss line width, are distinct from those of the tyrosyl radical species in PGHS-1 (12Hsi L.C.

Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Replacement of heme in PGHS-1 by mangano protoporphyrin IX gives a holoenzyme (MnPGHS-1) that retains most cyclooxygenase activity but only ∼4% of the peroxidase activity (14Odenwaller R. Maddipati K.R. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13863-13869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Strieder S. Schaible K. Scherer H.-J. Dietz R. Ruf H.H. J. Biol.

Previous studies demonstrated that a 35–38 G radical was produced in MnPGHS-1 during aerobic reactions with either fatty acid peroxide, 15-HPETE, or AA (16Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,17Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20045-20055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MnPGHS-1 radical structure was sensitive to the tyrosine modifying agent, tetranitromethane, and the kinetics of its formation appeared to correlate with production of PGG2/PGH2 (16Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, because of the EPR spectral differences with the tyrosyl radical in FePGHS-1, the roles of the peroxide-induced radicals in PGHS-2 and MnPGHS-1 in cyclooxygenase catalysis remained unclear. We have therefore tested the ability of these radicals to oxidize arachidonate to a fatty acid radical, a key step in the branched-chain mechanism in Scheme FS1. The results indicate that very similar arachidonyl free radicals are formed when the fatty acid is reacted with the PGHS-2 and MnPGHS-1 protein radicals. Analysis of the EPR spectrum of the arachidonyl radicals provides insight into the structure of the enzyme-bound fatty acid radicals in both PGHS isoforms. AA was purchased from NuChek Preps, Inc., Elysian, MN; 5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-octadeuterated arachidonic acid (d8-AA) was a generous gift of Hoffman-La Roche, Nutley, NJ. Polar contaminants were not detected in either deuterated or unlabeled AA when analyzed by silica gel thin layer chromatography with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (60:60:1) as the solvent. Mass spectral analysis of the methyl ester of the deuterated arachidonate indicated a composition of 76% d8 and 24% d7. The d8-AA was not purified further. Hemin was obtained from Sigma. Ethyl hydroperoxide (EtOOH) was the product of Polyscience Inc., Warrington, PA, and 15-HPETE was synthesized according to Graff et al. (18Graff G. Anderson L.A. Jaques L.W. Anal.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24019-24023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The holoenzymes were prepared by replenishing with heme or mangano protoporphyrin IX as described previously (16Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase activity was calculated from the oxygen consumption rate (19Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E.M. Benedetto C.

The batches of PGHS-1 used in this study had specific activities of 55–80 μmol of O2/min/mg of protein; those of PGHS-2 had specific activities of 27–42 μmol of O2/min/mg. The Y371F mutant of PGHS-2 was expressed in a baculovirus system and purified as the apoenzyme using procedures developed for wild-type PGHS-2 (21Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chiou M. Mackenzie R.

The Y371 holoenzyme was prepared by the same heme reconstitution procedure used for PGHS-1; the single turnover experimental procedures have also been described (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperatures on a Varian E-6 spectrometer (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The EPR conditions were: modulation amplitude, 2 G; time constant, 1 s; power, 1 mW; and temperature, 96 K. Radical concentrations were determined by double integration of the EPR signals, with reference to a copper standard (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Computer simulations of EPR spectra were done on a PC using a modified version of the POWFUN program (23Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11874-11880Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Drs. Gerald T. Babcock and Curt Hoganson, Michigan State University. When PGHS-2 was reacted anaerobically with 1.5 eq of EtOOH, a 29 G wide singlet (denoted WS2) amounting to about 0.1 spin/heme was routinely detected by EPR (Fig.1, spectrum a). Similar yields of radical have been found under these conditions with several batches of PGHS-2; the yield increased to about 0.3 spin/heme with 5 eq of EtOOH (data not shown). Subsequent anaerobic addition of 1.5 eq of AA led to the replacement of the WS2 radical with a new radical exhibiting a 7-line EPR centered at g = 2.0022, with a hyperfine splitting of 13.5–14 G and a slightly lower intensity (Fig. 1, spectrum b). Another sample freeze-trapped a minute later exhibited a very similar EPR line shape but with reduced amplitude (Fig. 1, spectrum c). These three samples subsequently were thawed and mixed with air. The EPR intensity of the WS2 signal in PGHS-2 reacted only with EtOOH decreased during aerobic incubation (Fig. 1, spectrum a′). The two samples of PGHS-2 reacted with EtOOH and AA both reformed the original WS2 tyrosyl radical and recovered significant intensity. This regeneration of the hydroperoxide-dependent tyrosyl radical upon aerobic incubation indicates that the radical formed after AA addition itself reacted with oxygen to form fresh hydroperoxide, as is expected from the mechanism (Scheme FS1), where the arachidonate radical reacts with oxygen to form the hydroperoxide, PGG2, and regenerate the tyrosyl radical (Steps 4 and 5). The 7-line EPR observed for the putative AA· in the PGHS-2 reaction (Fig. 1) is distinct from the isotropic AA· found earlier in PGHS-1 (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To determine if this 7-line radical in the PGHS-2 reaction is actually derived from the fatty acid, the single-turnover experiments were repeated with d8-AA. As shown in Fig.2, spectra b and c, the radical formed upon addition of d8-AA displayed an EPR centered at the same g value (2.0022) and had similar hyperfine splitting (13.5–14 G) as the radical formed with the unlabeled AA. The main difference is that the radical formed with d8-AA has five hyperfine lines in the EPR spectrum instead of the seven lines observed with unlabeled AA. A 5-line EPR pattern was also observed with PGHS-1 when d8-AA was used as reactant (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Conversion from a 7-line to a 5-line EPR spectrum with the deuterated fatty acid strongly supports the conclusion that these radicals are derived from the arachidonate substrate. Thawing and aerobic incubation of the samples with deuterated fatty acid radical regenerated the WS2 tyrosyl radical (Fig. 2, spectra b′ and c′), consistent with formation of hydroperoxide by reaction of the d8-AA fatty acid radical with oxygen. Tyr-385 has been shown to be the likely location of the wide doublet tyrosyl radical in PGHS-1 (24Tsai A.-L. Hsi L.C. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5085-5091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of mutating the corresponding residue in PGHS-2, Tyr-371, to phenylalanine were examined. The cyclooxygenase activity of the Y371F mutant was undetectable, whereas the peroxidase activity was 40–60 μmol of H2O2/min/mg, in the range observed for the wild-type activity (34–77 mmol of H2O2/min/mg). Thus, the Y371F mutation in PGHS-2 led to selective loss of cyclooxygenase activity, as was observed with the Y385F mutant of PGHS-1 (25Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When Y371F PGHS-2 was reacted with EtOOH, a 21 G radical signal was observed (Fig. 3, spectrum a). This signal is very similar to those found with indomethacin-treated PGHS-1, the Y385F mutant of PGHS-1 (24Tsai A.-L. Hsi L.C. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5085-5091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and nimesulide-treated PGHS-2 (13Xiao G. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), all of which have reduced or undetectable cyclooxygenase activity. Anaerobic addition of AA to the peroxide-induced radical in the Y371F mutant did not cause any EPR line shape change (Fig. 3, spectrum b). Longer incubation with AA led only to the decay of the 21 G signal (Fig. 3, spectrum c). Subsequent thawing and aerobic incubation of the samples did not lead to any changes of the EPR line shape (Fig. 3, spectra a′-c′). These results showed that although mutation of Tyr-371 in PGHS-2 did not prevent radical formation, the resulting radical was not able to oxidize AA. A 35 G wide doublet was generated upon reaction with 1.5 eq of 15-HPETE (Fig.4, spectrum a). Subsequent anaerobic addition of 1.5 eq. of AA converted this wide doublet to an isotropic radical with about the same line width, centered atg = 2.003 (Fig. 4, spectrum b). A sample freeze-trapped after another 30 s of reaction with AA (spectrum c in Fig. 4) displayed the same EPR spectral line shape but only 50% of the intensity of that in spectrum b. These three samples were subsequently thawed and incubated in air. Aerobic incubation had little effect on the intensity or line shapes of MnPGHS-1 incubated with 15-HPETE alone (spectrum a′). For the MnPGHS-1 samples incubated with 15-HPETE and AA, aerobic incubation led either to subtle changes of EPR line shape (spectrum b′) or a significant increase in amplitude (spectrum c′). To see if the isotropic MnPGHS-1 signals in spectra b and c in Fig. 4 are derived from arachidonic acid, these experiments were repeated with d8-AA in place of AA. The resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 5. The EPR signal from enzyme reacted with 15-HPETE and d8-AA exhibited five hyperfine lines with splittings of 13–14 gauss and centered at g = 2.003 (spectra b and c, respectively). Thawing and oxygenation of the samples reacted with 15-HPETE and d8-AA restored the 34–35 G radical signal found in the initial reaction of MnPGHS-1 with peroxide (Fig. 5, spectra b′ and c′). This change in EPR line shape, from an isotropic signal with unlabeled AA to a 5-line pattern with d8-AA, confirmed that the radicals in spectra b and c in Figs. 4 and 5 were derived from the fatty acid substrate, similar to the previous observations with FePGHS-1 (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In all cases, the radical concentrations peaked at about 0.1 spin/metalloporphyrin, as was previously observed for reaction between 15-HPETE and MnPGHS-1 (16Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In a separate experiment, concentrated FePGHS-1 (150 μm heme) in air-saturated buffer was reacted with 25 eq of AA. A radical with a 7-line spectrum centered at g = 2.002 was obtained with hyperfine splitting of 12–16 G and a concentration of about 0.11 spin/heme (Fig.6, top). The EPR lineshape of this radical species is very similar to that of the AA carbon-centered radical generated by PGHS-2 (Fig. 1, spectra b and c). Under these experimental conditions, the dissolved oxygen initially present in the FePGHS-1 reaction mixture (∼300 μm) would be enough to sustain only one catalytic cycle (2 mol of O2/mol of PGG2) for the concentrated enzyme used. With very limited oxygen replenishment by diffusion into the unstirred solution in the narrow EPR tube, anaerobiosis was achieved in situ, stopping the cyclooxygenase cycle at the stage of the fatty acid radical (Scheme FS1) in this sample. Oxidation of arachidonate to a fatty acid radical is a key step in the proposed branched-chain mechanism for PGHS cyclooxygenase catalysis (Step 3 in Scheme FS1). It has been demonstrated previously that the wide doublet (33–35 G) tyrosyl radical generated in FePGHS-1 by peroxide can oxidize AA and produce a carbon-centered AA· (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The tyrosyl radical induced by peroxide in PGHS-2 is a wide singlet (29–30 G), quite distinct from the initial wide doublet tyrosyl radical in FePGHS-1 (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Hsi L.C. Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Smith W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); the peroxide-induced radical in MnPGHS-1 also has an EPR spectrum distinct from the radical in FePGHS-1 (16Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The results of the present study demonstrate that the peroxide-induced radicals in PGHS-2 and MnPGHS-1 are both able to oxidize AA to form an AA· (Figs.1, 2, 4, and 5). This establishes that a peroxide-generated, protein-linked radical is chemically competent to play a common functional role as a redox mediator between the metalloporphyrin center and the AA substrate in FePGHS-1, MnPGHS-1, and FePGHS-2. In this study, prostaglandin formation is blocked by the lack of oxygen during the anaerobic portion of the reactions. Subsequent incubation of the AA· with air for several seconds leads to regeneration of the original tyrosyl radical(s) as predicted by Scheme FS1, consistent with conversion of the AA· to PGG2. Formation of prostaglandins during aerobic reaction of FePGHS-1 and MnPGHS-1 with arachidonate on a similar time scale has already been demonstrated (16Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have been previously cited (13Xiao G. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to suggest that the wide singlet radical observed in PGHS-2 upon reaction with EtOOH resides on Tyr-371 (corresponding to Tyr-385 in FePGHS-1). Assignment of the PGHS-2 radical to Tyr-371 and the involvement of this residue in cyclooxygenase catalysis are strengthened by the present results with the Y371F mutant of PGHS-2. This mutant lacked cyclooxygenase activity, demonstrating the requirement for a tyrosine residue at position 371 of PGHS-2. The Y371F mutant retained peroxidase catalytic competence, as expected from the proposed mechanism (SchemeFS1). Although the Y371F mutant generated a narrow singlet radical when reacted with peroxide, this radical did not oxidize AA (Fig. 3). The 21G narrow singlet radical in the PGHS-2 Y371F mutant has a line shape very similar to those in nimesulide-treated PGHS-2 or PGHS-1 inhibited by aspirin or indomethacin, each of which has impaired cyclooxygenase activity and normal peroxidase activity (13Xiao G. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Tsai A.-L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 833-837PubMed Google Scholar). The narrow singlet in inhibitor-treated PGHS-1 has been proposed to reside on a tyrosine residue other than Tyr385 (24Tsai A.-L. Hsi L.C. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5085-5091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The similarities with the present results suggest that the 21G narrow-singlet found in the PGHS-2 Y371F mutant is a tyrosyl radical formed on a residue other than Tyr-371. The narrow singlet tyrosyl radical induced in indomethacin-treated PGHS-1 by EtOOH was not able to oxidize AA (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but this could be ascribed to blockage of the cyclooxygenase site by indomethacin. The Y371F PGHS-2 mutant radical is also unable to oxidize AA (Fig. 3), but in this case, no inhibitor is present in the cyclooxygenase channel. This establishes clearly that AA is not oxidized by the Y371F mutant radical even though the fatty acid can freely access its binding site, making it likely that the radical in the Y371F mutant is some distance from the fatty acid site or not properly positioned to interact with the fatty acid. The residue bearing the radical has yet to be identified. MnPGHS-1 has been found to resemble FePGHS-1 in overall peroxidase mechanism and formation of high oxidation-state intermediates (29Tsai A.-L. Wei C. Baek H.K. Kulmacz R.J. Van Wart H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8885-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In MnPGHS-1, the radical is generated more efficiently by lipid hydroperoxides than by EtOOH, as might be expected from the preference of the MnPGHS-1 peroxidase activity for lipid substrates (16Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Accumulation of the radical correlates roughly with cyclooxygenase catalysis by MnPGHS-1 (16Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), just as for FePGHS-1 (27Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17753-17759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For both MnPGHS-1 and FePGHS-1, reaction with the tyrosine nitrating agent, tetranitromethane, leads to formation of a peroxide-induced radical with a narrower EPR spectrum and loss of cyclooxygenase activity (16Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,26Kulmacz R.J. Ren Y. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8760-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The present results extend the parallels between MnPGHS-1 and FePGHS-1, showing that the MnPGHS-1 radical is also able to oxidize arachidonate to a fatty acid radical (Figs. 4 and 5). This implies that the peroxide-generated radical in MnPGHS-1 is near the fatty acid binding site. A simple interpretation is that the wide doublet radical species in both MnPGHS-1 and FePGHS-1 are tyrosyl radicals residing on Tyr-385. If this is the case, the EPR differences between the MnPGHS-1 and FePGHS-1 radicals must arise from the influence of the different metal centers, situated about 10 Å away from Tyr-385 in the crystal structure (8Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). The effect of the metal on the reactivity of the radical toward the fatty acid remains to be evaluated. Dramatic changes of EPR line shape, from an isotropic singlet with unlabeled AA to a 5-line hyperfine pattern, have now been observed for both Fe- and MnPGHS-1 (Ref. 11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, and Figs. 4 and 5). The spectral changes with labeled AA are more subtle for PGHS-2 and required careful examination of the spectra to conclude that a transition from a 7- to a 5-line spectrum occurred when d8-AA replaced AA (Figs. 1 and 2). Computer simulation has been used to derive a consistent structural interpretation for the several AA (or d8-AA) radicals observed, with their distinct EPR spectral features. The uniform 5-line EPR signal found for d8-AA· (Figs. 2 and 5, and Ref. 11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) for FePGHS-1, MnPGHS-1, and FePGHS-2 indicates that the carbon-centered radical is most likely a pentadienyl radical (delocalized on five carbons, C11-C15 in Fig. 7) rather than an allyl radical (delocalized on three carbons, C11-C13 or C13-C15 in Fig. 7). This is because the latter would give, at most, a 4-line hyperfine pattern (when d8-AA was the substrate), i.e. splitting from the C13 proton and two β-protons, at either C10 or C16. The 7-line AA· EPR found for PGHS-2 reaction with unlabeled AA indicates that six protons interact with the unpaired electron delocalized over the C11-C15 pentadienyl structure (Fig. 7). Ab initio calculation for model pentadienyl radicals indicates that the electron densities at C12 and C14 are negligible compared with those at C11, C13, and C15 (30Hinchliffe A. Cobb J. J. Mol. Struct. 1974; 23: 273-279Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to the three strongly interacting protons at C13, C11, and C15, there must be 3 β-protons at C10 and C16 which also strongly interact with the unpaired electron (31Bascetta E. Gunstone F.D. Scrimgeour C.M. Walton J.C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1982; : 110-112Crossref Google Scholar, 32Davies A.G. Griller D. Ingold K.U. Lindsay D.A. Walton J.C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1981; 2: 633-641Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Acceptable simulations of the observed AA·EPR spectra were indeed achieved using a pentadienyl radical model having six strongly interacting protons, with three of them located at C10 and C16 (TableI and Figs. 1, 4, 6, and 7). The optimal values for the A tensors of the β-protons derived from these simulations allowed calculation of the dihedral angle, θ, between thepz orbital at C11 or C15 with the C10–H or C16–H bond containing the β-protons in question, using the conventional McConnell relationship (33Nelson M.J.

The endo protons in the pentadienyl radical are not equivalent to the β protons in the AA·. Open table in a new tab where AH, in gauss, is the coupling constant due to hyperconjugation, ρ is the unpaired electron density, and B0 and B1 are constants (assigned values of 4 and 50 for a hydrocarbon-free radical system). The ratio of the A tensor value measured for the endo proton of a model pentadienyl radical (9.6 G) to that of an isolated radical found for a methyl proton in the ethyl radical model (23 G), can be used to estimate a ρ value of 0.42 (33Nelson M.J. Cowling R.A. Seitz S.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4966-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Taken with the PGHS-2 and MnPGHS-1 EPR data (Table I), two sets of β proton dihedral angles can be calculated: 32° and 152° for the carbon atom where both protons interact strongly with the adjacent unpaired electron, and 51° and −71° for the carbon with only one strongly interacting proton. To decide which set of dihedral angles is associated with β protons on C10 and which is associated with those on C16, we considered the geometric conformation of the AA· in the cyclooxygenase site and its subsequent chemical conversion to PGG2, involving endoperoxide formation across C9 and C11 and ring closure between C8 and C12. We favor assignment of the 32°/152° pair to C10 and the 51°/−71° pair to C16 because this arrangement places C9 closer to C11 for endoperoxide formation and also brings C8 closer to C12 for subsequent ring closure (Fig. 7). These assignments fix the structure from C9-C17 of the carbon-centered AA· formed in the first step of cyclooxygenase reaction in PGHS-2 and MnPGHS-1. The values of the parameters which produced optimal EPR simulations for the AA· EPR of PGHS-2 and MnPGHS-1 are very similar (Table I). The main difference is a 2 G smaller coupling constant for the C13 proton for the MnPGHS-1 EPR. The EPR line shape is a sensitive function of the coupling constants used in the simulation. For example, the change of A(H13) from 9.5 to 11.5 G and of line width from 5 to 4 G resulted in a dramatic change of the predicted EPR appearance from a broad isotropic singlet for MnPGHS to a 7-line hyperfine pattern for PGHS-2 (compare Fig. 1, spectrum b and Fig. 4, spectrum b). Obviously, the experimental resolution of hyperfine features is dependent on many factors such as the inherent line width, temperature, sample homogeneity, etc. Using d8-AA significantly enhanced the resolution as the line broadening effects of protons at C11 and C15 were removed from the spectra, leading to a consistent 5-line hyperfine EPR spectrum originating from interactions of the unpaired electron and only the four protons at C10, C13, and C16. In our earlier provisional analysis (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), a 5-proton system was used to simulate the FePGHS-1 AA· EPR and a 3-proton system for the d8-AA· EPR, assuming that only one β proton each on C10 and C16 was interacting strongly with the unpaired electron at C11 and C15. These earlier simulations also did not attempt to use a consistent set of A tensor values for AA· and d8-AA·, and thus provided limited information about the fatty acid radical structure. The current EPR spectra for the AA· generated by PGHS-2, MnPGHS-1, and concentrated FePGHS-1 at high AA are clearly better interpreted as originating from a pentadienyl radical with not one but two strongly interacting β-protons at C10 (Figs. 1, 2, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). We therefore have reanalyzed the earlier PGHS-1 AA· EPR spectra (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) in light of the new data. However, the narrow line width of the PGHS-1 AA· EPR, 23 G, did not permit a satisfactory fit to the EPR data for both AA and d8-AA radicals with the individual basic parameter sets tested. Possible explanations for this difference in EPR lineshape are discussed below. It is important to note that the radical formed under oxygen-limiting conditions at high concentrations of enzyme and arachidonate exhibited a typical 7-line EPR very similar to that found for the AA· in PGHS-2 (Figs. 1 and 6). This 7-line EPR found for concentrated PGHS-1 is easily simulated using the same parameter values used to simulate the PGHS-2 AA·, with only a slight increase in line width (4.3 G instead of 4 G; Table I). Interestingly, a similar radical EPR spectrum was obtained earlier by Lassmann et al. (17Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20045-20055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for concentrated MnPGHS-1 reacted with a high concentration of AA (Fig. 6) This 7-line EPR with MnPGHS-1 is also simulated easily by the same set of parameters used for PGHS-2, with a line width of 5 G (Table I). These results help to resolve one of the remaining puzzles about the identity of the radical generated using high enzyme and substrate concentrations: why was an EPR similar to that found for the AA· observed instead of a tyrosyl radical? We propose that the oxygen dissolved in the reaction mixture was exhausted in a very few turnovers when high concentrations of enzyme and fatty acid are present, thus trapping the cyclooxygenase reaction at the carbon-centered AA· stage, as predicted by the mechanism in Scheme FS1. This conclusion that further turnover of the enzyme was blocked by oxygen exhaustion is supported by the observation that only 1 eq of total eicosanoid products were formed by MnPGHS-1 (17Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20045-20055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the EPR line shape of the AA· generated in FePGHS-1 at high concentrations of enzyme and substrate (Fig. 6) does differ from the singlet observed earlier at low enzyme and substrate concentration (11Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This could be due to different AA· structures under the two sets of reaction conditions. However, the simulated EPR line shape of the AA· is highly sensitive to the effects of small changes in coupling constants (Table I and Figs. 1 b and 4 b). We thus suggest that several aspects of the different appearances of AA· spectra probably result from slight differences in factors that determine the inherent EPR line width of a common planar pentadienyl radical. It does remain possible that differences in the kinetics of AA· formation with high and low enzyme concentrations may lead to trapping of AA· with different conformations. In any case, the AA· structure may not be the same as that of enzyme-bound AA, because substantial conformational changes accompany pentadienyl radical formation, and adaptive changes in the protein could occur to stabilize the carbon-centered radical. In summary, the present results show that the peroxide-induced tyrosyl radical in FePGHS-2 and the peroxide-induced radical in MnPGHS-1, which is probably also a tyrosyl radical, are both capable of oxidizing arachidonate to a carbon centered fatty acid radical. This provides strong support for a key step in the tyrosyl radical mechanism proposed for PGHS cyclooxygenase catalysis. Interpretation of the EPR spectra provides a detailed description of the structures of the arachidonyl radicals formed in FePGHS-1 and -2 and in MnPGHS-1. We are very grateful to Dr. Mark J. Nelson at DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Company, Wilmington, DE. for valuable advice on interpretation of the arachidonate EPR data. We also thank Wei Chen and Liliana Scarafia for their help in enzyme preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2045199665,"This study was initiated to determine whether the intestinal H+/peptide symporter PEPT1 differentiates between the peptide bond conformers of substrates. We synthesized a modified dipeptide where the peptide bond is replaced by the isosteric thioxo peptide bond. The Ala-Pro derivative Ala-ψ[CS-N]-Pro exists as a mixture of cis and trans conformation in aqueous solution and is characterized by a low cis/transisomerization rate. The compound was recognized by PEPT1 with high affinity. The Ki value of Ala-ψ[CS-N]-Pro for the inhibition of the uptake of radiolabeled glycylsarcosine in Caco-2 cells was 0.30 ± 0.02 mm, determined in solution with 96% trans conformation. In contrast, theKi value was 0.51 ± 0.02 mm when uptake media with 62% trans conformer were used. We conclude that only the trans conformer interacts with the transport system. From our data, a significant affinity of thecis conformer at PEPT1 cannot be derived. In a second approach, conformer-specific uptake of Ala-ψ[CS-N]-Pro was studied by analyzing the intracellular content of Caco-2 cells following transport as well as the composition of the extracellular medium using capillary electrophoresis. The percentage of transconformer that was 62% in the uptake medium increased to 92% inside the cells. This is the first direct evidence that an H+/peptide cotransport system selectively binds and transports the trans conformer of a peptide derivative. This study was initiated to determine whether the intestinal H+/peptide symporter PEPT1 differentiates between the peptide bond conformers of substrates. We synthesized a modified dipeptide where the peptide bond is replaced by the isosteric thioxo peptide bond. The Ala-Pro derivative Ala-ψ[CS-N]-Pro exists as a mixture of cis and trans conformation in aqueous solution and is characterized by a low cis/transisomerization rate. The compound was recognized by PEPT1 with high affinity. The Ki value of Ala-ψ[CS-N]-Pro for the inhibition of the uptake of radiolabeled glycylsarcosine in Caco-2 cells was 0.30 ± 0.02 mm, determined in solution with 96% trans conformation. In contrast, theKi value was 0.51 ± 0.02 mm when uptake media with 62% trans conformer were used. We conclude that only the trans conformer interacts with the transport system. From our data, a significant affinity of thecis conformer at PEPT1 cannot be derived. In a second approach, conformer-specific uptake of Ala-ψ[CS-N]-Pro was studied by analyzing the intracellular content of Caco-2 cells following transport as well as the composition of the extracellular medium using capillary electrophoresis. The percentage of transconformer that was 62% in the uptake medium increased to 92% inside the cells. This is the first direct evidence that an H+/peptide cotransport system selectively binds and transports the trans conformer of a peptide derivative. The peptide transporters expressed in the brush border membrane of the intestinal and renal epithelial cells are responsible for the absorption of oligopeptides that consist of two or three amino acids. These transporters are driven by a transmembrane proton gradient and mediate the symport of their substrates with H+ (1Ganapathy V. Brandsch M. Leibach F.H. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1773-1794Google Scholar, 2Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Annu. Rev.

In addition to their natural substrates, peptide transporters are also capable of transporting many pharmacologically active peptidomimetics (5Amidon G.L. Lee H.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

However, all of the chemically diverse substrates studied so far seem to bear interacting sites correctly aligned to the transporter by sterical resemblance to the backbone of physiologically occurring di- and tripeptides (5Amidon G.L.

American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1995: 101-134Google Scholar). Therefore, in the design of pharmacologically active peptidomimetics that interact with peptide carriers, modification of the backbone will become increasingly important.In the present investigation, we studied the influence of the substrate backbone dynamics caused by peptide bond cis/transisomerization on the intestinal peptide transport. Both cis and trans conformers can be found in peptides and proteins due to the partial double bond character of the peptide bond. Yet, the free energy difference between cis and transisomers is lower in the imide than in the amide bond. Therefore, among peptides made of gene-coded amino acids, a significant population of the energetically disfavored cis conformation has been described so far only for Xaa-Pro peptide bonds (7Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986: 186-187Google Scholar, 8Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For proteases, it has been shown that they prefer the trans conformation at and near the scissile bond of their substrates (9Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). On the other hand, peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases utilize bothcis and trans isomers of peptide and protein substrates (8Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Whether peptide transporters are able to differentiate between cis and trans conformers of di- and tripeptides has not yet been shown. Measuring 4- to 12-fold lower affinities of Gly-Pro and Gly-Sar compared with Gly-Gly and Gly-Ala at the renal peptide transporter, Daniel et al.(13Daniel H. Morse E.L. Adibi S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9565-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, have already discussed that isomerization at the peptide bond might be responsible. To study cis/trans conformational effects, ideally, conformers of one and the same substrate should be used. Unfortunately, it has been proven to be difficult to stabilize pure peptide bond conformers for a period sufficient for transport experiments because the cis/trans interconversion of natural Xaa-Pro dipeptides occurs at room temperature within seconds to minutes (8Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar). A peptide therefore had to be found that is characterized by being a proteolytically stable substrate for the peptide carrier, by a sufficiently low cis/trans interconversion rate and by the possibility to vary its isomer ratio. We have chosen to synthesize a modified Ala-Pro where the peptide carbonyl oxygen is replaced by sulfur. Thioxo oligopeptides are known to be isosteric to their non-thioxylated counterparts (14Schutkowski M. Jakob M. Landgraf G. Born I. Neubert K. Fischer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, replacing the peptide bond by a thioxo peptide bond in Xaa-Pro peptides resulted in an up to 100-fold retardation in the cis/trans isomerization rates due to a higher barrier of rotation at the C–N bond (14Schutkowski M. Jakob M. Landgraf G. Born I. Neubert K. Fischer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Schutkowski M. Wöllner S. Fischer G.

The C-terminal SH2 domain of SYK kinase is essential for its ability to activate PLC-γ2.

In a recent study, we discovered that exposure of B-lineage lymphoid cells to low energy EMF stimulates LYN as well as its downstream substrate SYK (18Uckun F.M. Kurosaki T. Jin J. Jun X. Morgan A.

These results prompted the hypothesis that a delicate growth regulatory balance might be altered in B-lineage lymphoid cells by EMF-induced activation of a biochemical signaling cascade intimately linked to LYN kinase. The purpose of the present study was to further characterize this signaling cascade using a EMF-responsive lymphoma B cell model and targeted disruption of the genes for known or suspected participants such as LYN, SYK, and PLC-γ2 by homologous recombination knockout. The establishment and characterization of wild-type and LYN-deficient, SYK-deficient, PLC-γ2-deficient clones of DT40 chicken lymphoma B cells were previously reported (19Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G.

Cells were maintained in suspension cultures at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The culture medium was RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2.5% chicken serum, 10 mm l-glutamine, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The expression levels of wild-type and mutant enzyme proteins in the various cell lines were measured by Western blot analysis using appropriate monoclonal antibodies, as described previously (24Uckun F.M. Yang Z. Sather H. Steinherz P. Nachman J. Bostrom B. Crotty L. Sarquis M. Ek O. Zeren T. Tubergen D. Reaman G. Gaynon P. Blood. 1997; 89: 3769-3777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells (5 × 106cells/sample) were lysed in 150 μl of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mmdithiothreitol) and boiled for 5 min. The DNA was sheared by several passages through a 28-gauge needle, and 40-μl amounts of the whole cell lysate protein samples in SDS-reducing sample buffer were fractionated on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels by overnight electrophoresis at 4 mA. The proteins were transferred to a 0.45-μm Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for 1 h at 130 mA using a semidry transfer apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5% bovine serum albumin), washed in rinsing buffer, and incubated for 1 h with the appropriate primary antibody (i.e. polyclonal rabbit anti-FYN serum at 1:2,000 final dilution, monoclonal 4D10 IgG2a anti-SYK antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. at 10 ng/ml final concentration, or polyclonal rabbit anti-PLC-γ2 serum at 1:1,000 final dilution mixed with monoclonal 4D10 IgG2a anti-SYK antibody (for comparison of SYK protein levels in the lanes as an internal control) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. at 10 ng/ml final concentration) in blocking solution followed by three 10-min washes in rinsing buffer. For detection of the target enzyme proteins, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse/rabbit IgG (Signal Transduction Laboratories; 1:2500 dilution, 45-min incubation) and the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Life Sciences) were used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. The membranes immunoblotted with anti-FYN or anti-SYK antibodies were stripped and reblotted with the mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Sigma, catalog no. A-4700; 1:50,000 final dilution) to compare the protein levels in the individual lanes. In other experiments, wild-type and mutant SYK proteins were immunoprecipitated, and in vitro immune complex kinase assays were performed, as described previously (25Uckun F.M. Evans W.E.

A homogenous vertical magnetic field was set up by using a Merritt's coil-based in vitro low frequency EMF exposure system (18Uckun F.M. Kurosaki T. Jin J. Jun X. Morgan A. Takata M. Bolen J. Luben R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27666-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Merritt's four square coil system is known to produce a large volume of uniform magnetic field. The applied vertical sinusoidal 60-Hz field was 0.1 mT (1 Gauss). The current needed to obtain 1 Gauss was 0.7 A. The magnetic field was parallel to the coil axis and was uniform near the axis and the center of the coil system. Cells were maintained at all times in a low AC (8 mG) environment except during a single centrifugation step. This was achieved by using a 2-pole motor tissue incubator (CEDCO model IRE 93) with low AC fields for routine cell culture and by defining the lowest field regions within the incubator. Exponentially growing cells (5 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free α-minimum essential medium in 1.5-ml capacity microcentrifuge tubes) were exposed to a 1-Gauss, 60-Hz EMF by placing the tubes at the center of the four-coil field generator, which was contained in an incubator with shielding sheets of metal alloy at the bottom of the chambers. Control tubes were simultaneously placed inside a duplicate incubator without the exposure apparatus. To measure the fields in the incubators, the laminar flow hood, centrifuge, and nearby areas, a gaussmeter (MAG model 25, Magnetic Sciences International) was used. EMF strength was constantly monitored with the gaussmeter and adjusted manually if needed. In all experiments, the coils were activated before the placement of the cells, to avoid fluctuations of the EMF during activation of the apparatus. The coils were turned off only after the cells were taken out of the exposure system. Ice-cold perchloric acid (20%) was added after EMF exposure to the cell suspensions to stop further response. The test tubes were kept on ice for 20 min and then sedimented at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, the pH was neutralized to 7.5 with ice-cold 10 mm KOH, and the solution was centrifuged again. The supernatant was collected and stored at −20 °C for subsequent measurement of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) levels. Ins-1,4,5-P3 levels were measured by using ad-myo-[3H]Ins-1,4,5-P3assay system purchased from Amersham Corp., as reported elsewhere (26Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B.

In some experiments, cells were stimulated with 3 μg/ml anti-chicken IgM monoclonal antibody M4 at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time in the figures. The catalytic activity of PLC-γ2 is regulated through tyrosine phosphorylation by receptor- and non-receptor-type PTKs, and biochemical signals that trigger tyrosine-specific protein phosphorylation have been shown to precede the activation of PLC-γ2 and stimulation of inositol phospholipid turnover in many experimental systems (10Takata M.

Therefore, we examined the effects of EMF on inositol phospholipid turnover in DT40 lymphoma B cells using a highly specific and quantitatived-myo-[3H]Ins-1,4,5-P3assay system. Exposure of DT40 cells to EMF stimulated a rapid and biphasic increase in the production of Ins-1,4,5-P3 leading to markedly elevated Ins-1,4,5-P3 levels at 1 min after the start of EMF exposure, which were 9.9-fold higher than the Ins-1,4,5-P3 levels in the sham-treated controls (21.8 ± 9 pmol/106 cells versus 2.2 ± 0.6 pmol/106 cells, p < 0.05). Thereafter, the level of Ins-1,4,5-P3 rapidly declined but at 5 min it was still higher than the baseline (Fig.1 A). The magnitude and kinetics of EMF-induced Ins-1,4,5-P3 response were similar to those of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 response triggered by engagement of the B cell antigen receptor with an anti-IgM monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1 A). These experiments provided evidence that the biochemical signal triggered in DT40 lymphoma B cells by low energy EMF is intimately linked to signal transduction pathways that stimulate inositol phospholipid turnover, producing Ins-1,4,5-P3 as a second messenger. The PTK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein attenuated the EMF-triggered Ins-1,4,5-P3 signals (Fig.1 A), providing strong evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation is a requisite step in the EMF-triggered stimulation of inositol phospholipid turnover in lymphoma B cells. In contrast to wild-type DT40 cells, DT40 cells rendered PLC-γ2-deficient by targeted disruption of the PLC-γ2 gene did not show any increase in Ins-1,4,5-P3 levels after EMF exposure (Fig.1 B), confirming that PLC-γ2 is required for EMF-induced stimulation of inositol phospholipid turnover. Since the SH2 domains of PLC-γ2 are essential in activation of PLC-γ2 during the B cell antigen receptor-linked signaling cascade, we examined the effect of SH2 domain mutations on EMF-induced Ins-1,4,5-P3 production. As shown in Fig. 1 C, PLC-γ2-deficient DT40 cells reconstituted with a SH2 domain mutant PLC-γ2 failed to elicit an Ins-1,4,5-P3 response upon EMF exposure. The inset of Fig. 1 C depicts an immunoblot confirming the absence of PLC-γ2 protein in PLC-γ2− cells and abundant expression of the mutant protein in PLC-γ2-deficient cells reconstituted with SH2 domain mutant PLC-γ2. All three cell lines express comparable amounts of SYK kinase protein. The relative amount of mutant PLC-γ2 in the reconstituted cell line is greater than the amount of wild-type PLC-γ2 in the parent cell line. Thus, the absence of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal in the reconstituted cell line is not caused by expression of less PLC-γ2 protein. Since SH2 domains mediate intermolecular interactions by binding to phosphotyrosine containing sequences, these results indicate that recruitment of PLC-γ2 via its SH2 domains to inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins or associated PTK such as SYK is a prerequisite for EMF-induced activation of PLC-γ2. Since the tyrosine kinase SYK is required for antigen-receptor mediated activation of PLC-γ2 (10Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 20Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), we next examined the role of SYK in EMF-induced activation of PLC-γ2. EMF exposure did not induce an Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal in SYK-deficient DT40 cells (Fig.2 A), providing experimental evidence that the tyrosine kinase SYK, which is required for antigen receptor-mediated activation of PLC-γ2 and consequent production of Ins-1,4,5-P3, is also required for EMF-induced activation of PLC-γ2. SYK-deficient cells reconstituted with a C-terminal SH2 domain mutant syk gene also failed to elicit increased inositol phospholipid turnover after EMF exposure (Fig. 2 B), whereas SYK-deficient cells reconstituted with an N-terminal SH2 domain mutant syk gene showed a significant EMF response (Fig.2 C). Whereas no SYK protein or associated kinase activity could be detected in SYK-deficient cells, the amount of mutant SYK protein (Fig. 2 D) and associated kinase activity (Fig.2 E) in the SYK-deficient cell line reconstituted with the C-terminal SH2 domain mutant syk gene were actually higher than the amount and associated kinase activity of the wild-type SYK protein in the parent cell line. Therefore, the absence of an EMF-induced Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal in this cell line indicates that the C-terminal SH2 domain of SYK is required for the EMF-induced Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal. Since both SYK-SH2 domain mutant cell lines expressed similar amounts of the respective mutant SYK proteins and associated kinase activity (Fig. 2, D and E), the absence of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal in the mutant cell line reconstituted with the C-terminal SH2 domain-mutant form of SYK cannot be explained by lower levels or less kinase activity of the mutant SYK protein in that cell line. Our results indicate that only the C-terminal SH2 domain of SYK is required for the EMF-induced Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal. The magnitude and kinetics of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal in the SYK-deficient DT40 cells reconstituted with the N-terminal SH2 domain-mutant form of SYK were different than those in wild-type DT40 cells. The reasons for these differences, which may be due to the relatively higher levels of kinase active SYK protein expression in the reconstituted cells (Fig. 2, D and E), remain unknown. We also noticed that the differences in SYK activity between the SH2-domain mutantversus wild-type DT40 cells were greater than predicted from the apparent SYK protein levels. The reasons for these observations are unknown but may relate to the inability of SH2 domain mutant SYK to interact with an as yet unidentified inhibitor associated with the SYK SH2 domain. Because LYN kinase is required for the antigen receptor-induced PLC-γ2 activation in DT40 cells and functions upstream of SYK (10Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), we next examined the role of LYN kinase in EMF-induced inositol phospholipid turnover. Targeted disruption of thelyn gene abolished the EMF-induced Ins-1,4,5-P3signal (Fig. 3 A). Introduction of the wild-type (Fig. 3 B) or an SH2 domain mutant (Fig.3 C) but not a kinase domain mutant fyn gene (Fig.3 D) or an SH3 domain mutant fyn gene (Fig.3 E) into LYN-deficient cells restored the EMF responsiveness, even though LYN-deficient cells reconstituted with these genes expressed similar amounts of FYN protein (Fig.3 F). Thus, the kinase and SH3 domains of FYN are required for its ability to restore the EMF responsiveness in LYN-deficient cells. However, the Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal in FYN(WT)-reconstituted cells was monophasic with a single peak at 45 s (Fig. 3 B), whereas the Ins-1,4,5-P3signal in the parent cell line was biphasic with one early peak at 15 s and a second peak at 1 min (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the magnitude of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal signal in wild-type FYN-reconstituted cells was smaller than the magnitude of the biphasic Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal in the parent DT40 cell line. The reasons for these differences are unknown. Notably, reconstitution of LYN-deficient cells with a SH2 domain mutant fyn gene resulted in a biphasic Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal after EMF exposure, and the kinetics as well as amplitude of this signal were similar to those of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal in the parent cell line. While these results provide conclusive evidence that the SH2 domain of FYN is not required for the EMF-induced Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal, they also demonstrate that, despite the apparent similarity of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 signal after EMF exposure or stimulation with an anti-IgM antibody, significant differences must exist between EMF-induced signaling events and signaling events induced by engagement of the B cell antigen receptor for which the SH2 domain of Src family PTK play a pivotal role. In summary, we examined the molecular mechanism of enhanced inositol phospholipid turnover in lymphoma B cells exposed to low energy EMF. Our findings are consistent with a sequential activation model, according to which EMF exposure first leads to activation of Src family PTK. Src family PTK interact with and phosphorylate as yet unidentified immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), leading to recruitment of SYK tyrosine kinase as well as PLC-γ2 via their SH2 domains to phosphorylated ITAMs. However, we have no evidence that Src family PTK interact with an ITAM motif in EMF-stimulated cells, as proposed in this model. Subsequently, SYK may be activated by Src family PTK and phosphorylate PLC-γ2, leading to PLC-γ2 activation. Activation of PLC-γ2 results in increased inositol phospholipid turnover, production of Ins-1,4,5-P3 and protein kinase C activation. This study further supports the hypothesis that a delicate growth regulatory balance in B-lineage lymphoid cells might be altered by EMF exposure. The mechanism by which exposure of lymphoma B cells to low energy EMF triggers activation of Src family PTK remains to be deciphered."

Hence, fatty acids may act as genuine uncouplers of cellular oxidative phosphorylation by interacting with specific mitochondrial proteins, including the adenine nucleotide translocase. Mitochondrial uncoupling by fatty acids has been well reported during the last 50 years (reviewed in Ref. 1Wojtczak L. Schönfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Uncoupling of isolated mitochondria by fatty acids interferes with mitochondrial ATP synthase activity and results in increase in mitochondrial state 4 respiration with a concomitant decrease in the P/O ratio. Uncoupling by fatty acids was ascribed to the protonophoric action of fatty acids resulting in dissipation of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (1Wojtczak L. Schönfeld P. Biochim. Biophys.

The protonophoric action of fatty acids was proposed to be mediated by fatty acids crossing the mitochondrial membrane in their protonated form followed by efflux of the fatty acid anion through an anion channel or paired with a putative membrane-permeant cation (1Wojtczak L.

Inhibition of fatty acid-induced uncoupling by atractyloside or ADP (9Andreyev A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) has indicated that the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) 1The abbreviations used are: ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase; MEDICA 16, β,β′-methyl-substituted hexadecane α,ω-dioic acid; pmf, proton motive force.could perhaps serve as anion channel for the dissociated fatty acid (10Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). ANT has indeed been recently reported to mediate proton transport by free fatty acids in reconstituted ANT-cytochrome coxidase proteoliposomes (11Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27329-27336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the well reported uncoupling effect in isolated mitochondria, the uncoupling activity of fatty acids in vivois still questionable. Fatty acids are well known to stimulate respiration of isolated hepatocytes, perfused liver, and heart. However, it remains disputed whether stimulation of respiration by fatty acids in these systems is accounted for by their availability as substrates for oxidation or may be further ascribed to their intrinsic mitochondrial uncoupling activity. Uncoupling of the perfused liver by fatty acids has been claimed by Soboll and co-workers (12Scholz R. Schwabe U. Soboll S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Soboll S. Gründel S. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) based on resolving the relaxation kinetics of the increase in oxygen consumption induced by added fatty acids into a rapid “oxidative” component and a slower “uncoupling-like” component accompanied by acidification of mitochondrial matrix. These findings have been further corroborated in perfused hearts where added octanoate was observed to induce an increase in oxygen consumption, while ATP synthesis measured by31P NMR magnetization transfer technique remained unaffected, thus resulting in a concomitant decline in P/O ratio (14Kingsley-Hickman P.B. Sako E.Y. Ugurbil K. From A.H.L. Foker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1545-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These claims were, however, challenged by other observations made both in perfused systems as well as in cultured cells and employing inhibitors of ATP synthesis. Thus, increase in oxygen consumption induced by fatty acids in the perfused liver (15Debeer L.J. Mannaertz G. De Schepper P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or in isolated liver cells (16Plomp P.J.A.M. Van Roermund C.W.T. Groen A.K. Meijer A.J. Tager J.M. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Brand M.D. Nobes C.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 14: 1200-1201Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was reported to be essentially eliminated by added oligomycin or atractyloside, indicating that oxidative phosphorylation remained fully coupled in the presence of added fatty acids. Furthermore, mitochondrial membrane potential measured in situ in isolated hepatocytes (18Nobes C.D. Hay Jr., W.W. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12910-12915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or phosphorylation potential measured in situ in the perfused heart (19Hassinen I. Nioka S. Chance B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were found to be rather increased by added fatty acids, thus refuting a protonophoric effect exerted by fatty acids. Similarly, extra oxygen consumed upon oleate respiration in rat hepatocytes could be essentially accounted for by extra glucose formation (20Schönfeld P. Wojtczak A.B. Geelen M.J.H. Kunz W. Wojtczak L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 836: 280-286Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hence, extramitochondrial ATP-consuming reactions stimulated by fatty acids were proposed to account for the increase in oxidation of the added fatty acid substratein vivo (21Nobes C.D. Brown G.C. Olive P.N. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12903-12909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residual respiration in the presence of oligomycin was ascribed to increase in conductance of the inner mitochondrial membrane (21Nobes C.D. Brown G.C. Olive P.N. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12903-12909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) due to a non-ohmic proton leak induced by the highly oxidizable fatty acid substrate. To dissociate between the substrate and modulatory effects of fatty acids on oxidative phosphorylation, the putative uncoupling effect induced by long chain fatty acids was studied here using a nonmetabolizable methyl-substituted α,ω-dicarboxylic acid (MEDICA 16) (HOOC-CH2-C(CH3)2-(CH2)10-C(CH3)2-CH2-COOH) consisting of a long chain fatty acid of 16 carbon atoms in length, carboxy-substituted at the ω-end to eliminate its ω-oxidation and methyl-substituted at the β,β′ positions to eliminate β-oxidation of the fatty acyl analogue (22Bar-Tana J. Rose-Kahn G. Srebnik M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8404-8410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MEDICA 16 is reported here to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in liver cells and in isolated liver and heart mitochondria. Rat hepatocytes were prepared as described in Ref. 23Berry M.N.

Viability of freshly isolated cells was evaluated by the exclusion of erythrosin B and amounted to >85%. Isolated cells were kept on ice and used within 4 h. Liver and heart mitochondria were prepared as described previously (24Kalderon B. Hermesh O. Bar-Tana J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3552-3556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mela L. Seitz S.

Oxygen consumption of freshly isolated hepatocytes or isolated mitochondria was measured using an oxygen electrode in a 3-ml chamber under constant steering. Liver cell suspensions were adjusted to a density of 1 × 106 cell/ml and incubated at 35 °C in the presence of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 137 mmNaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mmglucose, 10 mm lactate, 1 mm pyruvate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, and MEDICA 16 or palmitate as indicated added together with defatted albumin at a molar ratio of 14/1 or 6/1, respectively.

For JC-1 staining, cell suspension was adjusted to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in a medium containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 137 mmNaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mmglucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mmMgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2 and was further incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the dark with 6 μg JC-1/ml. Following staining, the cells were washed twice and 1 × 106 cells/ml were resuspended in the above medium supplemented with 10 mm lactate and 1 mmpyruvate under constant gassing with 95% O2, 5% CO2 mixture for 20 min at 37 °C. MEDICA 16 or palmitate were added as indicated together with defatted albumin at a molar ratio of 14/1 or 6/1, respectively. Following incubation, the cells were subjected to excitation at 488 nm (argon laser lamp, 15 milliwatts), and the fluorescence emission yield was recorded at 530 nm (FL1) and 590 nm (FL2). FL1-FL2 and FL2-FL1 compensations were 1–2% and 12–20%, respectively. A minimum of 10,000 events per sample were acquired and then analyzed using Lysys II software. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) and proton gradient (ΔpH) of isolated mitochondria were measured as described previously (24Kalderon B. Hermesh O. Bar-Tana J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3552-3556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rottenberg H.

Extra- and intramitochondrial spaces were evaluated by following the distribution of3H2O together with [14C]sucrose. For measuring succinate-generated mitochondrial Δψ and ΔpH, 2–2.5 mg of mitochondrial protein were incubated at 30 °C in 1 ml of incubation medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmsuccinate, 5 μm rotenone, 0.6 μg/ml oligomycin, 320 pmol of valinomycin/mg of protein, and MEDICA 16 as indicated. For measuring ATP-generated mitochondrial Δψ and ΔpH, 2–2.5 mg of mitochondrial protein were incubated in 1 ml of incubation medium containing 200 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 3 mmATP, 5 μm rotenone, 320 pmol of valinomycin/mg of protein, and MEDICA 16 as indicated. Proton motive force (pmf) was calculated as described in Ref. 28Rottenberg H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 547-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way repeated measures analysis of variance, followed by multiple comparison analysis of means. When a significant value (p < 0.05) was obtained, differences between individual means were analyzed by Bonferroni test (45Krauth J. Distribution-free Statistics: An Application-oriented Approach. 1st Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1988Google Scholar). Respiration rate of freshly isolated hepatocytes was increased by MEDICA 16 approaching 1.6-fold activation of basal respiration at saturating MEDICA 16 concentrations (Fig.1). Respiration induced by MEDICA 16 was as pronounced as that induced by palmitate (Fig. 1). MEDICA 16 concentrations required for half-maximal activation of basal respiration amounted to 0.06 mm as compared with 0.34 mm of palmitate, reflecting presumably the metabolic stability of MEDICA 16. In line with previous reports (15Debeer L.J. Mannaertz G. De Schepper P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Plomp P.J.A.M. Van Roermund C.W.T.

Trans. 1985; 14: 1200-1201Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), palmitate respiration was effectively (but not completely) inhibited by oligomycin, whereas activation of respiration by MEDICA 16 remained unaffected by oligomycin (not shown), indicating that activation by palmitate was partly due to coupled respiration of an oxidizable substrate. Mitochondrial membrane potential of isolated liver cells incubated in the presence or absence of MEDICA 16 was evaluated by following the intracellular distribution of the lipophilic cation JC-1 (26Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). While the cytosolic monomeric dye emits at 530 nm (when excited at 488 nm), the fluorescence emission of the intramitochondrial aggregated dye shifts to 590 nm. The 530/590 fluorescence ratio thus reflects the cytosolic/mitochondrial distribution of the dye and the prevailing mitochondrial inner membrane potential of respective cells (27Cossarizza A. Baccarani-Contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 29Salvioli S. Ardizonni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, incubating JC-1-stained hepatocytes in the presence of added valinomycin or MEDICA 16 resulted in an overall 590 to 530 nm shift in the fluorescence emission of the cells, thus reflecting a decrease in intramitochondrial JC-1 aggregates as a result of mitochondrial inner membrane depolarization. Decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential as a function of added MEDICA 16 was concentration-dependent and saturable having an EC50 of 0.08 mm (Fig.3). In contrast to MEDICA 16 and in line with previous reports (21Nobes C.D. Brown G.C. Olive P.N. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12903-12909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no substantial change in mitochondrial membrane potential was induced by added palmitate under conditions where respiration was significantly activated.Figure 3The effect of MEDICA 16 and palmitate on mitochondrial membrane potential in liver cells. Mitochondrial membrane potential was determined in JC-1-stained liver cells incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of MEDICA 16 (•) or palmitate (▪) as indicated. One representative experiment out of six similar experiments. The 530 nm/590 nm emission ratio is inversely correlated with mitochondrial depolarization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The apparent uncoupling effect induced by MEDICA 16 in liver cells was further analyzed in isolated liver mitochondria. State 4 respiration of succinate respiring mitochondria was similarly activated by MEDICA 16 or palmitate (Fig. 4). Activation of respiration by MEDICA 16 (or palmitate) was concentration-dependent, having an EC50 of 14.0 nmol/mg of protein and reaching 3-fold activation at saturation. The effect of MEDICA 16 on pmf, membrane potential, and proton gradient in isolated mitochondria was evaluated under conditions where mitochondrial pmf was either generated at the expense of succinate respiration or of ATP hydrolysis (Fig.5). As shown in Fig. 5 A, adding MEDICA 16 to mitochondria respiring on succinate resulted in a concentration-dependent saturable decrease of all three parameters. The maximal effect exerted by MEDICA 16 at saturation amounted to 30% decrease in proton gradient, membrane potential, or pmf. The EC50 for the MEDICA 16 uncoupling effect amounted to 11.5 nmol/mg of protein, being similar to the EC50 value for activation of mitochondrial respiration of succinate by MEDICA 16 (Fig. 4). The three mitochondrial parameters were similarly affected by MEDICA 16 under conditions where mitochondrial pmf was maintained by ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5 B). Here again, the uncoupling effect of MEDICA 16 was saturable, reaching 30% decrease in pmf at saturating MEDICA 16 and having an EC50 of 9.6 nmol/mg of protein. However, in contrast to succinate generated pmf, membrane potential was the main pmf component affected by MEDICA 16 under conditions of ATP-generated mitochondrial pmf. Mitochondrial uncoupling by MEDICA 16 was essentially eliminated upon washing out MEDICA 16 (Fig. 6). Similarly, proton gradient, mitochondrial membrane potential, and pmf of liver mitochondria isolated from rats treated with MEDICA 16in vivo and studied in vitro in theabsence of MEDICA 16 added to the incubation medium were all found to remain unaffected by the in vivo treatment with MEDICA 16 (not shown). Hence, the MEDICA 16 effect requires its direct interaction with mitochondria and may be washed out in the course of preparing liver mitochondria from MEDICA 16-treated animals. The putative role played by ANT in the uncoupling effect of MEDICA 16 was verified by studying the effect exerted by MEDICA 16 in the presence of added atractylate. In light of the enrichment of ANT in heart mitochondria as compared with liver mitochondria (30Schönfeld P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the atractylate effect was studied in isolated heart mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 7 and in line with previous reports (9Andreyev A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), added atractylate partially suppressed the increase in respiration induced by palmitate. MEDICA 16 uncoupling was similarly and significantly suppressed by atractylate, indicating that uncoupling by MEDICA 16 was partially mediated by ANT. Despite the established uncoupling effect of long chain fatty acids in isolated mitochondria (1Wojtczak L. Schönfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), their uncoupling activity in vivo is still disputed. Thus, stimulation of respiration by fatty acids in cell cultures and perfusion systems was ascribed to their availability as substrates for mitochondrial oxidation (15Debeer L.J. Mannaertz G. De Schepper P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Plomp P.J.A.M. Van Roermund C.W.T. Groen A.K. Meijer A.J. Tager J.M.

Trans. 1985; 14: 1200-1201Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), to stimulating extramitochondrial ATP-consuming reactions (20Schönfeld P. Wojtczak A.B. Geelen M.J.H. Kunz W. Wojtczak L. Biochim.

Biochem. 1984; 141: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Soboll S. Gründel S. Scholz R. Eur. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1545-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or to a non-ohmic proton leak induced by an highly oxidizable substrate (21Nobes C.D. Brown G.C. Olive P.N. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12903-12909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, evaluating the extent of uncoupling during the course of fatty acid respiration in perfusion systems or cell cultures maintained at or near state 3 may be flawed by (a) the opposing effects on mitochondrial membrane potential of uncoupling (resulting in decreased pmf) and respiration of a highly oxidizable substrate (resulting in increased pmf), (b) masking the putative intrinsic uncoupling effect of fatty acids by possible extramitochondrial ATP-consuming processes or by a non-ohmic proton leak induced by fatty acids or their oxidation products (18Nobes C.D. Hay Jr., W.W. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12910-12915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (c) possible interference by oligomycin or atractyloside with mitochondrial components claimed to be involved in fatty acid-induced uncoupling in isolated mitochondria (e.g. ANT, ATPase, proton pumps) or with nonmitochondrial components (e.g, Na+, K+-ATPase (31Fahn S. Koval G.J. Albers R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1882-1889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SOC-mediated calcium influx (32Cho J.H. Balasubramanyam M. Chernaya G. Gardner J.P. Aviv A. Reeves J.P. Dargis P.G. Christian E.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)), which could affect mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. To dissociate between substrate and modulatory effects of fatty acids on oxidative phosphorylation, the putative uncoupling effect of fatty acids was studied here using a fatty acyl analogue which does not serve as substrate for β- or ω-oxidation, thus making it possible to analyze the intrinsic uncoupling cellular activity of fatty acids in the absence of inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation and under conditions where uncoupling is not interfered by respiration of the putative uncoupler. MEDICA 16 was found here to induce in liver cells a saturable decrease in mitochondrial pmf with a concomitant oligomycin-insensitive increase in cellular respiration. The strict correlation observed between increased respiration and decreased pmf seems to be consistent with uncoupling rather than “decoupling” (3Rottenberg H. Hashimoto K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1747-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Rottenberg H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by MEDICA 16. This uncoupling activity of MEDICA 16 may therefore implicate an intrinsic uncoupling activity of long chain fatty acids independent of their availability as substrates for oxidation. However, and in contrast to MEDICA 16, uncoupling by fatty acids still allows for substrate availability, thus avoiding substrate limitation under conditions of enhanced uncoupled respiration. Hence, the apparent maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential in the presence of added palmitate (Fig. 3) may reflect the resultant of decreased pmf due to uncoupling by the long chain fatty acid compromised by increased pmf due to respiration of a highly oxidizable substrate. This conclusion is in line with the limited sensitivity of palmitate respiration to oligomycin in liver cells (Fig.1) and conforms with studies previously reported by Soboll and co-workers (12Scholz R. Schwabe U. Soboll S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Soboll S. Gründel S. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in the perfused liver. Uncoupling of liver cells or isolated mitochondria by MEDICA 16 is saturable, thus implicating its interaction with a specific mitochondrial component involved in modulating mitochondrial membrane conductance. As the MEDICA 16 effect in mitochondria is observed at μm concentrations of the compound and pH range of 7.4, the uncoupling activity of MEDICA 16 may not be accounted for by its transport through the dicarboxylate electroneutral transporter (33Liu G. Hinch B. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25338-25344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which requires millimolar concentrations of the transported dicarboxylate and is inhibited at neutral pH (33Liu G. Hinch B. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25338-25344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, partially suppressing the activity of MEDICA 16 by atractyloside (Fig.7) may specifically implicate ANT in the uncoupling activity of MEDICA 16, in line with recent studies reporting proton transport mediated by free fatty acids in reconstituted ANT-cytochrome c oxidase proteoliposomes (11Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27329-27336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the homology between ANT and the fatty acid-responsive UCP1 protein (thermogenin) of brown adipose tissue (34Klingenberg M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), saturation by MEDICA 16 may be accounted for by ANT-catalyzed flip-flop of the MEDICA 16 anion followed by diffusion/flip-flop of the protonated acid (10Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 11Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the four β,β′-methyl substitutions are obligatory for the cycling protonophoric activity of MEDICA 16, as nonsubstituted long chain dicarboxylic acids have been reported to be inactive as cycling protonophores (36Ježek P. Modriansky M. Garlid K.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Ježek P. Modriansky M. Garlid K.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ANT-mediated uncoupling by fatty acids or their analogues could perhaps be further complemented by similar ANT-related, fatty acid-responsive mitochondrial proteins controlling the conductance of the mitochondrial inner membrane in liver or muscle. The recently cloned UCP2 and UCP3 genes are of special interest in this context in light of their ubiquitous abundance (38Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C.

Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Substantial uncoupling by long chain fatty acids requires fatty acid concentrations in the range of 0.5–2 mm (Fig. 3). These concentrations are higher than those prevailing under normal physiological conditions but may be observed during starvation, diabetes, or thermogenesis. Uncoupling of liver cells by long chain fatty acids under ketogenic conditions may allow for liver production of exported ketone bodies at rates that are not limited by liver ATP consumption and requirements. Similarly, and in analogy with thermogenin-mediated uncoupling in brown adipose tissue, uncoupling of muscle and/or liver by long chain fatty acids may allow for heat production not limited by ATP requirements of the concerned organs. Loose mitochondrial coupling by long chain fatty acids within the normal concentration range could also be of importance in modulating the efficiency of body weight gain in mammals lacking brown adipose tissue. Mitochondria uncoupling by nonmetabolizable fatty acyl analogues like MEDICA 16 may be pharmacologically exploited for controlling human obesity and obesity-related pathologies, e.g.non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, dyslipoproteinemia, and others constituting the Metabolic Syndrome (40De Fronzo R.A. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (4169) Google Scholar). Mitochondria uncoupling by MEDICA 16 may indeed account for the pronounced decrease in liver phosphate and redox potentials (41Kalderon B. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1629-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as well as the increase in liver 2F. J. Carmichael and J. Bar-Tana, Yu., Bondareva, T. O., Dedukhova, V. I., Mokhova, E.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1958-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in MEDICA 16-treated animals. Direct uncoupling by MEDICA 16 may further complement the calorigenic activity of MEDICA 16 previously ascribed to transcriptional activation of liver thyroid hormone-dependent genes (43Hertz R. Aurbach R. Hashimoto T. Bar-Tana J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 44Hertz R. Ben-Ishai A. Nikodem V. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The contribution made by the nuclear and mitochondrial activities of MEDICA 16 to the overall calorigenic activity of the drug in vivostill remains to be investigated."

TRAF2A and TRAF2 cDNAs are identical in sequence with the exception of an extra 21 base pairs of sequence encoding a 7-amino acid insert within the TRAF2A RING finger domain. TRAF2A mRNA expression is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, with relative TRAF2A mRNA levels being highest in spleen and lowest in brain.

However, TRAF2A levels in transiently transfected COS-7 cells approach those of TRAF2 upon coexpression with TRAF1 and/or TRAF2, indicating that TRAF2A stability is regulated by the binding of other TRAF family proteins. Also in contrast to TRAF2, TRAF2A is unable to stimulate NF-κB activity when overexpressed in 293 cells and acts as a dominant inhibitor of TNFR2-dependent NF-κB activation.

Members of the TNFR family can interact through their cytoplasmic domains with a range of intracellular signal transduction proteins, most of which fall into one of two distinct homology groups.

In the case of TRAF2, both the RING finger domain and the first two zinc finger domains are essential for NF-κB activation (24Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). TRAF2 mediates NF-κB activation via the recruitment of the serine/threonine kinase NIK (23Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), which can in turn activate CHUK, an IκB-specific kinase that triggers IκB degradation (25Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X.

Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). In addition to recruiting mediators of NF-κB activation, TRAF2 can bind at least three other molecules (I-TRAF/TANK, A20, TRIP) that inhibit its ability to activate NF-κB (19Rothe M. Xiong J. Shu H.-B. Williamson K. Goddard A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8241-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The efficiency of NF-κB activation via TRAF2 in a given cell therefore depends on the relative levels and activities of a number of different regulatory molecules.In this study, we describe TRAF2A, a splice variant of TRAF2 that contains a 7-amino acid insertion within the RING finger domain. TRAF2A is incapable of mediating the activation of NF-κB and can act as a dominant inhibitor of TNFR2-mediated NF-κB activation. Thus, alternative splicing of primary transcripts from the TRAF2/TRAF2A gene to produce TRAF2A as opposed to TRAF2 mRNAs may represent a novel mechanism by which cells can regulate NF-κB activation through TNF family receptors.DISCUSSIONWe describe here the identification and primary characterization of TRAF2A, a previously unknown splice variant of the gene encoding TRAF2. TRAF2A mRNA is produced by alternate usage of splice donor sites present at the 3′-end of (presumably) exon 1 and differs from TRAF2 mRNA in encoding an additional 7 amino acid residues within the amino-terminal RING finger domain (Fig. 1). The production of TRAF2A and TRAF2 mRNAs is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, the ratio of TRAF2A to TRAF2 mRNAs varying significantly between the different tissues examined (Fig. 2). Given the functional and biochemical differences identified here between the TRAF2 and TRAF2A proteins, alternate splicing of the TRAF2/TRAF2A gene may represent an important mechanism for regulating cellular responses to signaling through members of the TNFR family.Studies utilizing GST fusion proteins of TRAF2 and TRAF2A RING finger domains suggested that the extra 7 amino acids within the TRAF2A RING finger do not significantly disrupt the zinc-stabilized RING finger fold (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the apparent permissiveness of the of the spacing of the sixth and seventh zinc-coordinating residues, which ranges from 4 to 48 residues in different RING finger proteins (29Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Given the high conservation of spacing between nearly all of the other zinc-coordinating residues (29Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), alternative splicing of small amounts of sequence into this region of the RING finger may have evolved to allow specific physical and presumably functional alterations to the domain without disrupting the overall RING finger fold. The fact that a splice site is positioned in the same region of TRAF4 (CART1) and TRAF3 (9Régnier C.H. Tomasetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Chenard M.-P. Wendling C. Basset P. Rio M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Xu Y. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1996; 5: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) indicates that such a mechanism could be utilized in the expression of other RING finger proteins.The apparent stability of the TRAF2A RING finger domain in bacteria stands in contrast to the short half-life of TRAF2A compared with TRAF2 in LBRM T-lymphoma cells (Fig. 5) and in COS-7 cells (Fig.4 B). This observation may be explained by the presence in mammalian but not bacterial cells of proteolytic systems that target the TRAF2A but not the TRAF2 RING finger for degradation. One possible candidate for this is the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway, a common regulator of proteins in signal transduction pathways (33Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism responsible for the short intrinsic half-life of TRAF2A, it is greatly inhibited by the coexpression of TRAF2A with and presumably binding to TRAF1 and/or TRAF2 (Fig. 5). Given that production of high levels of TRAF2A mRNA in normal cells is probably accompanied by down-regulation of TRAF2 mRNA, TRAF1 seems more likely to stabilize TRAF2A under physiological conditions. In this respect, it is interesting to note that TRAF1, which exhibits tissue-specific and inducible expression (5Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), is expressed at high levels in spleen, the tissue found here to express the highest levels of TRAF2A mRNA (Fig. 2).The precise role of TRAF2A remains to be identified. It is possible that TRAF2A, by virtue of its unique RING finger structure, may initiate a unique signaling cascade in response to ligation of TNF family receptors. Nevertheless, the demonstration here that TRAF2A cannot activate NF-κB and has a dominant inhibitory effect on this function suggests that one consequence of TRAF2A expression may be to down-regulate the TRAF2-dependent NF-κB activation pathway. While the ability of TRAF2A to act as dominant inhibitor may depend on it being stabilized in some way (e.g. by TRAF1), a shift toward exclusive production of TRAF2A mRNA would be expected to inhibit TRAF2-dependent NF-κB activation by simply down-regulating TRAF2 levels. Such a mechanism may act in addition to or complement the actions of other inhibitors of TRAF-dependent NF-κB activation. For example, unlike the actions of I-TRAF/TANK and A20 (19Rothe M. Xiong J. Shu H.-B. Williamson K. Goddard A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8241-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), splicing to TRAF2A is likely to specifically inhibit TRAF2-mediated NF-κB activation and not activation of NF-κB through TRAF6. Also, the specific conditions under which alternate splicing to TRAF2A occurs may differ from those required to activate other inhibitors of TRAF2-mediated NF-κB activation.The presence of multiple mechanisms for down-regulating NF-κB responses indicates the importance of this form of signal regulation. Evidence for the role such mechanisms may play in regulating cellular responses comes from experiments demonstrating that inhibition of TNFR1-mediated NF-κB activation can enhance the apoptotic signal transduced through this receptor (34Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 35Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin J.A.S.

Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Since TRAF2 mediates the activation of NF-κB by TNFR1, switching to the production of TRAF2A by cells may mark them for killing by TNF or related cytokines. To clarify this and other potential functions of the alternate splicing of the TRAF2/TRAF2A gene, it will be important to identify the cells (e.g. splenic subpopulation) that produce TRAF2A mRNA as the major splice product.

Members of the TNFR family can interact through their cytoplasmic domains with a range of intracellular signal transduction proteins, most of which fall into one of two distinct homology groups. The first of these is the death domain-containing proteins, including TRADD, FADD/MORT1, and RIP, which associate directly with receptors also containing death domains, such as TNFR1 and Fas (2Hsu H.

TRAF family molecules share a conserved carboxyl-terminal domain, which mediates receptor binding, homooligomerization, and, in the case of TRAF1 and TRAF2, heterooligomerization (5Rothe M. Wong S.C.

In the case of TRAF2, both the RING finger domain and the first two zinc finger domains are essential for NF-κB activation (24Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). TRAF2 mediates NF-κB activation via the recruitment of the serine/threonine kinase NIK (23Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), which can in turn activate CHUK, an IκB-specific kinase that triggers IκB degradation (25Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X.

Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). In addition to recruiting mediators of NF-κB activation, TRAF2 can bind at least three other molecules (I-TRAF/TANK, A20, TRIP) that inhibit its ability to activate NF-κB (19Rothe M. Xiong J. Shu H.-B. Williamson K. Goddard A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8241-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The efficiency of NF-κB activation via TRAF2 in a given cell therefore depends on the relative levels and activities of a number of different regulatory molecules. In this study, we describe TRAF2A, a splice variant of TRAF2 that contains a 7-amino acid insertion within the RING finger domain. TRAF2A is incapable of mediating the activation of NF-κB and can act as a dominant inhibitor of TNFR2-mediated NF-κB activation. Thus, alternative splicing of primary transcripts from the TRAF2/TRAF2A gene to produce TRAF2A as opposed to TRAF2 mRNAs may represent a novel mechanism by which cells can regulate NF-κB activation through TNF family receptors. DISCUSSIONWe describe here the identification and primary characterization of TRAF2A, a previously unknown splice variant of the gene encoding TRAF2. TRAF2A mRNA is produced by alternate usage of splice donor sites present at the 3′-end of (presumably) exon 1 and differs from TRAF2 mRNA in encoding an additional 7 amino acid residues within the amino-terminal RING finger domain (Fig. 1). The production of TRAF2A and TRAF2 mRNAs is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, the ratio of TRAF2A to TRAF2 mRNAs varying significantly between the different tissues examined (Fig. 2). Given the functional and biochemical differences identified here between the TRAF2 and TRAF2A proteins, alternate splicing of the TRAF2/TRAF2A gene may represent an important mechanism for regulating cellular responses to signaling through members of the TNFR family.Studies utilizing GST fusion proteins of TRAF2 and TRAF2A RING finger domains suggested that the extra 7 amino acids within the TRAF2A RING finger do not significantly disrupt the zinc-stabilized RING finger fold (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the apparent permissiveness of the of the spacing of the sixth and seventh zinc-coordinating residues, which ranges from 4 to 48 residues in different RING finger proteins (29Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Given the high conservation of spacing between nearly all of the other zinc-coordinating residues (29Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), alternative splicing of small amounts of sequence into this region of the RING finger may have evolved to allow specific physical and presumably functional alterations to the domain without disrupting the overall RING finger fold. The fact that a splice site is positioned in the same region of TRAF4 (CART1) and TRAF3 (9Régnier C.H. Tomasetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Chenard M.-P. Wendling C. Basset P. Rio M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Xu Y. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1996; 5: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) indicates that such a mechanism could be utilized in the expression of other RING finger proteins.The apparent stability of the TRAF2A RING finger domain in bacteria stands in contrast to the short half-life of TRAF2A compared with TRAF2 in LBRM T-lymphoma cells (Fig. 5) and in COS-7 cells (Fig.4 B). This observation may be explained by the presence in mammalian but not bacterial cells of proteolytic systems that target the TRAF2A but not the TRAF2 RING finger for degradation. One possible candidate for this is the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway, a common regulator of proteins in signal transduction pathways (33Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism responsible for the short intrinsic half-life of TRAF2A, it is greatly inhibited by the coexpression of TRAF2A with and presumably binding to TRAF1 and/or TRAF2 (Fig. 5). Given that production of high levels of TRAF2A mRNA in normal cells is probably accompanied by down-regulation of TRAF2 mRNA, TRAF1 seems more likely to stabilize TRAF2A under physiological conditions. In this respect, it is interesting to note that TRAF1, which exhibits tissue-specific and inducible expression (5Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), is expressed at high levels in spleen, the tissue found here to express the highest levels of TRAF2A mRNA (Fig. 2).The precise role of TRAF2A remains to be identified. It is possible that TRAF2A, by virtue of its unique RING finger structure, may initiate a unique signaling cascade in response to ligation of TNF family receptors. Nevertheless, the demonstration here that TRAF2A cannot activate NF-κB and has a dominant inhibitory effect on this function suggests that one consequence of TRAF2A expression may be to down-regulate the TRAF2-dependent NF-κB activation pathway. While the ability of TRAF2A to act as dominant inhibitor may depend on it being stabilized in some way (e.g. by TRAF1), a shift toward exclusive production of TRAF2A mRNA would be expected to inhibit TRAF2-dependent NF-κB activation by simply down-regulating TRAF2 levels. Such a mechanism may act in addition to or complement the actions of other inhibitors of TRAF-dependent NF-κB activation. For example, unlike the actions of I-TRAF/TANK and A20 (19Rothe M. Xiong J. Shu H.-B. Williamson K. Goddard A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8241-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), splicing to TRAF2A is likely to specifically inhibit TRAF2-mediated NF-κB activation and not activation of NF-κB through TRAF6. Also, the specific conditions under which alternate splicing to TRAF2A occurs may differ from those required to activate other inhibitors of TRAF2-mediated NF-κB activation.The presence of multiple mechanisms for down-regulating NF-κB responses indicates the importance of this form of signal regulation. Evidence for the role such mechanisms may play in regulating cellular responses comes from experiments demonstrating that inhibition of TNFR1-mediated NF-κB activation can enhance the apoptotic signal transduced through this receptor (34Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 35Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin J.A.S.

Since TRAF2 mediates the activation of NF-κB by TNFR1, switching to the production of TRAF2A by cells may mark them for killing by TNF or related cytokines. To clarify this and other potential functions of the alternate splicing of the TRAF2/TRAF2A gene, it will be important to identify the cells (e.g. splenic subpopulation) that produce TRAF2A mRNA as the major splice product. This search is currently under way. We describe here the identification and primary characterization of TRAF2A, a previously unknown splice variant of the gene encoding TRAF2.

https://openalex.org/W1979590680,"An n-alkane-assimilating yeastCandida maltosa contains multiplen-alkane-inducible forms of cytochromes P450 (P450alk), which can be assumed to catalyze terminal hydroxylation of n-alkanes in the assimilation pathway. Eight structurally related P450alk genes have been identified. In the present study, the function of four major isoforms of P450alk (encoded byALK1, ALK2, ALK3, and ALK5 genes) was investigated by sequential gene disruption. Auxotrophic markers used for the selection of disrupted strains were regenerated repeatedly through either mitotic recombination between heterozygous alleles of the diploid genome or directed deletion of the marker gene, to allow sequential gene disruptions within a single strain. The strain depleted of all four isoforms could not utilizen-alkanes for growth, providing direct evidence that P450alk is essential for n-alkane assimilation. Growth properties of a series of intermediate disrupted strains, plasmid-based complementation, and enzyme assays after heterologous expression of single isoforms revealed (i) that each of the four individual isoforms is alone sufficient to allow growth on long chain n-alkane; (ii) that the ALK1-encoding isoform is the most versatile and efficient P450alk form, considering both its enzymatic activity and its ability to confer growth on n-alkanes of different chain length; and (iii) that the ALK5-encoding isoform exhibits a rather narrow substrate specificity and thus cannot support the utilization of short chain n-alkanes.

Cytochromes P450 are heme-containing monooxygenases that are distributed widely among living organisms (1Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Gonzalez F.J. Coon M.J. Gunsalus I.C. Gotoh O. Okuda K. Nebert D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Higher eukaryotes generally contain multiple forms of cytochrome P450 catalyzing diverse oxidative reactions in the metabolism of a large number of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. Depending on the induction level and substrate specificity of individual cytochromes P450, cellular metabolic processes are often effected by a specific ensemble of isoforms, making it difficult to distinguish their biological function. In microorganisms, such a cytochrome P450 multiplicity only rarely can be found. One of the microorganisms harboring a cytochrome P450 multigene family is an n-alkane-assimilating yeastCandida maltosa (2Schunck W.-H. Kärgel E. Gross B. Wiedmann B. Mauersberger S. Köpke K.

DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 767-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), this yeast species contains n-alkane-inducible forms of P450 (P450alk), and eight structurally related P450alk genes belonging to theCYP52 family were identified. Coupled with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (8Ohkuma M. Masuda Y. Park S.M. Ohtomo R. Ohta A. Takagi M. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), they are assumed to catalyze the terminal hydroxylation of n-alkanes, which represents the first and rate-limiting step in the n-alkane assimilation pathway. The functions of the C. maltosa cytochromes P450 were first apparent from in vitro reconstitution of n-alkane hydroxylase and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase purified from n-alkane-grown C. maltosa cells (9Honeck H. Schunck W.-H. Riege P. Müller H.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 147: 240-244Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to these investigations, recent studies revealed the enzymatic characters of some P450alk forms by means of heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (11Zimmer T. Kaminski K.

However, investigations about the cellular significance of individual P450alk isoforms for then-alkane assimilation pathway are still fragmental. In particular, it remains to be clarified whether indeed such a P450alk multiplicity is required for the n-alkane assimilation pathway of C. maltosa and to what extent each of the gene products of eight P450alk genes contributes to the respectiven-alkane-assimilating phenotype. Recent development of the genetic engineering systems including host-vector systems as well as the gene disruption method, which enabled us to disrupt stepwise both alleles of a certain gene in the diploid genome by using two selectable markers, have greatly facilitated molecular biological analyses of C. maltosa(14Takagi M.

As an initial step to address the cellular function of individual isoforms of P450alk, we previously disrupted the first isolated P450alk gene and found that the disrupted stain retained the ability to utilize n-alkanes as a sole carbon and energy source because of the n-alkane hydroxylation activity of the other P450alk forms. In the present paper we describe the sequential disruption of multiple P450alk genes and show the effect of these disruptions on the n-alkane-assimilating property of C. maltosa. The results in this paper provide evidence that the difference in substrate specificity among multiple isoforms of P450alk in vivo can be detected clearly by using the gene disruption technique even in a nonconventional yeast. The C. maltosa strains used in this study are listed in Table I.

A 6.7-kb SalI-BamHI fragment carrying entire ALK2-B and ALK3-B genes and their 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions (4Ohkuma M. Tanimoto T. Yano K. Takagi M. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pUC19 to construct pUA23. For gene disruption of the ALK2-ALK3locus, a 1.6-kb EcoRV-BamHI fragment of pURAD and a 1.5-kb DraI-BamHI fragment of pUADE replaced a 4.1-kb BglII-EcoRV fragment of pUA23 to construct pUD23U and pUD23A, respectively. Thealk2-alk3::URA3 and thealk2-alk3:: ADE1 cassettes for gene disruption were excised from pDA23U and pDA23A, respectively, with PstI-BamHI double digestions in both cases, and transformed into C. maltosa. The transformation of C. maltosa was performed by a modified lithium acetate method (14Takagi M. Kawai S. Chang M.C. Shibuya I. Yano K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For regeneration of the ADE1 marker, pDA23Δade was constructed by ligation of a 1.3-kbPstI-EcoRV fragment from pUD23A and a 1.3-kbEcoRV-BamHI fragment from pUA23 into thePstI-BamHI sites of pUC19, and thealk2-alk3::Δade1 cassette was generated by digestions with PstI-BamHI for the C. maltosa transformation. In these three cassettes, the complete ALK2 coding region, NH2-terminal one-third of the coding region of ALK3, and theALK2-ALK3 internal region (1.0 kb) were replaced. A 2.1-kb HindIII-HindIII fragment of ALK5-A (6Ohkuma M. Muraoka S. Tanimoto T. Fujii M. Ohta A. Takagi M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the HindIII site of pUC19 to construct pUA5. A 0.6-kb BglII-EcoRV fragment of pUA5 was replaced with either the 1.6-kbEcoRV-BamHI fragment of pURAD or the 1.5-kbDraI-BamHI fragment of pUADE to construct pUD5U and pUD5A, respectively. The alk5::URA3 and the alk5::ADE1 disruption cassettes were excised from pUD5U and pUD5A, respectively, with PstI-ScaI digestions in each case. Both cassettes replaced the NH2-terminal 40% of the coding region of ALK5. A 2.8-kb EcoT22I-EcoT22I fragment of ALK1-A (3Takagi M. Ohkuma M. Kobayashi N. Watanabe M. Yano K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 2217-2226Google Scholar) was subcloned into the PstI site of pUC119 to construct pUA1. A 0.5-kb EcoRV-EcoRV fragment corresponding to the central one-third of the ALK1coding region was replaced by a 1.8-kbHindIII-BamHI fragment of pURAD containingURA3 through blunt end ligation to construct pUD1U. Thealk1::URA3 disruption cassette was excised from pUD1U with SphI-BamHI digestions. The construction of the other plasmids for the ALK1disruption, pUD45A and pUD45H, was described previously (17Ohkuma M. Hikiji T. Tanimoto T. Schunck W.-H. Müller H.-G. Yano K. Takagi M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 1757-1764PubMed Google Scholar). Total DNA of C. maltosa was isolated from a culture of 10 ml of YNB-glucose medium as described (18Ohkuma M. Muraoka S. Hwang C.W. Ohta A. Takagi M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis was performed with an ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) gene detection system (Amersham) in accordance with the instruction of the supplier. For detection of the appropriate gene replacements of the ALK2-ALK3 locus, total DNA from the transformants was digested with BamHI and ClaI and probed with a 0.6-kb HindIII fragment of ALK3-B (see Fig. 2). For the ALK5 and ALK1 replacements, total DNA from the transformants was digested with HindIII and PstI-BglII, respectively, and probed with a 2.1-kb HindIII fragment of ALK5-A and a 2.3-kb HindIII fragment of ALK1-A, respectively. The appropriate replacements were confirmed as follows. Both of the intact alleles of ALK5gave a 2.2-kb doublet band. The genomic blot of the first step transformant gave a 3.3-kb band as predicted for the replacement with URA3 in addition to the 2.2-kb band of the undisrupted allele. That of the second step transformant gave new 1.0- and 2.0-kb bands as predicted for the replacement with ADE1 in addition to the 3.3-kb band for the URA3-replacement, and the 2.2-kb band for the intact ALK5 allele disappeared. in ALK1 disruptions the genomic blots of the transformants for the replacements with URA3, ADE1, and HIS5 gave 8.2-, 9.1-, and 9.8-kb bands, respectively. Disruption of both alleles of ALK1 was confirmed by detection of each of the two respective bands for the replacements and by the disappearance of the 7.0-kb band for the intact allele of ALK1. A 0.9-kb SalI fragment of pURAD (18Ohkuma M. Muraoka S. Hwang C.W. Ohta A. Takagi M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a 0.7-kb EcoRI-EcoRV fragment of ADE1(16Kawai S. Hikiji T. Murao S. Takagi M. Yano K. Agric. Biol.

Genet. 1989; 16: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were also used as probes to confirm the replacements of URA3, ADE1, and HIS5, respectively. To determine the expression level of spectrally active P450 in the wild-type strain CHAU1 as well as in the disruptant strains DA235-24, DA123-14, and DA1235-12, respective cultures were first grown to a density of about 1 × 107 cells/ml in a yeast minimal medium containing 1.34% Yeast Nitrogen Base, 2% glucose and, as required, histidine (50 mg/liter), adenine (100 mg/liter), and uracil (40 mg/liter). Then cells were washed in the fresh medium without glucose and cultivated under the same conditions except for 1% dodecane as a sole carbon source. P450 contents were determined after an induction time of 4 h by means of CO difference spectra (10Schunck W.-H. Mauersberger S. Huth J. Riege P. Müller H.-G. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 147: 240-244Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A 1.8-kb PstI-XhoI fragment of the TRA region, which contains an autonomously replicating sequence and a centromeric DNA of C. maltosa (19Ohkuma M. Kobayashi K. Kawai S. Hwang C.W. Ohta A. Takagi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was isolated from the vector pTRA11 (14Takagi M. Kawai S. Chang M.C. Shibuya I. Yano K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into the PstI site of pUC18 through aPstI linker. From the resulting plasmid a 1.8-kbPstI fragment was inserted into the AatII site of pUC19 through blunt end ligation. Then a 1.2-kbDraI-XbaI fragment of URA3 from pURAD was inserted into the XhoI site of the TRA region through anXhoI linker to construct pUTU1. A 2.8-kbBamHI-SphI fragment of ALK1-A isolated from pUA1 was inserted into the BamHI-SphI sites of pUTU1 to construct pUTU-ALK1. A 2.6-kb BglII fragment of ALK2-A and a 3.3-kb EcoT22I-EcoRV fragment of ALK3-A were inserted into the BamHI site and the PstI-SmaI sites of pUTU1 to construct pUTU-ALK2 and pUTU-ALK3, respectively. A 3.5-kbPstI-EcoRI fragment of ALK5-A was inserted into the PstI-SmaI sites through blunt end ligation to construct pUTU-ALK5. Exchanges of the promoter regions of ALK1 and ALK5 genes were done by polymerase chain reaction as follows. To obtain recombinant products having ALK1 promoter and ALK5 coding region, primers 5′-AACATCTGGTCATGATTGATGAAATACTTCCT-3′ and 5′-TCATCAATCATGACCAGATGTTATAAATG-3′ were used. For the product having ALK5 promoter and ALK1 coding region, primers 5′-TAAACTAAAAATATGGCTATAGAACAAATTATTG-3′ and 5′-GTTCTATAGCCATATTTTTAGTTTAATCTTATTTAAA-3′, respectively, were used. Underlines correspond to the translational initiation codons. As flanking primers, M13 forward and reverse sequencing primers were used. Plasmids pUTU-ALK1 and pUTU-ALK5 were used as templates for the first polymerase chain reaction step to obtain the respective promoter and coding region. Then the second polymerase chain reaction step generated exchanged recombinant products. The products were cloned into theKpnI-SphI sites of pUTU1 to construct pUTU-A1/A5 (ALK1 promoter and ALK5 coding region) and pUTU-A5/A1 (ALK5-promoter and ALK1-coding region), respectively. Construction of the four coexpression vectors used for the simultaneous production of the individual C. maltosa P450alk forms and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase was described previously (13Zimmer T. Ohkuma M. Ohta A. Takagi M. Schunck W.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae was done as described previously (11Zimmer T. Kaminski K. Scheller U. Vogel F. Schunck W.-H. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The enzyme assay was carried out using the microsomal fraction using [1-14C]dodecane (Sigma) and [1-14C]hexadecane (Amersham) as substrates as described previously (13Zimmer T. Ohkuma M. Ohta A. Takagi M. Schunck W.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have shown that four out of the eight P450alk genes of C. maltosa are significantly induced by n-alkanes and may thus encode P450 enzymes directly involved in n-alkane assimilation in the previous study (6Ohkuma M. Muraoka S. Tanimoto T. Fujii M. Ohta A. Takagi M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These four genes have been designated ALK1, ALK2, ALK3, and ALK5. Each of them occurs in two allelic variants in agreement with the diploid nature of C. maltosa genome. Previous gene disruption experiments revealed that a C. maltosa strain defective in ALK1 retained the ability to grow on long chain n-alkanes (17Ohkuma M. Hikiji T. Tanimoto T. Schunck W.-H. Müller H.-G. Yano K. Takagi M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 1757-1764PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been the first objective of the present study to disrupt each of the other three n-alkane-inducible P450alk genes (for the experimental strategy applied, see Fig.1) and to examine on this basis their contribution to the phenotype of n-alkane assimilation. As a parental strain, C. maltosa CHAU1, in which three selectable auxotrophic markers (ura3, ade1, and his5) were available, was used (18Ohkuma M. Muraoka S. Hwang C.W. Ohta A. Takagi M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the fact that ALK2 and ALK3 are clustered in about a 1.0-kb distance (4Ohkuma M. Tanimoto T. Yano K. Takagi M. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), these two genes could be disrupted simultaneously by a single gene replacement. Strain CHAU1 was first transformed with the alk2-alk3::URA3 disruption cassette to uracil prototrophy. To disrupt the remaining intact allele of ALK2-ALK3, the resulting Ura+transformant was then transformed with thealk2-alk3::ADE1 disruption cassette. The appropriate gene disruption was detected by Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA of the first step Ura+ transformant (strain DA23-8) and the second step Ura+-Ade+transformant (strain DA23-81; see Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). The resulting strain DA23-81 (his5, ade1, ura3, alk2-alk3::URA3/alk2-alk3::ADE1) had disruption in both alleles of ALK2-ALK3 locus. As in the case of the disruption of ALK2-ALK3, the disruption of ALK5 was also performed using stepwise URA3 and ADE1 as selectable markers, thus generating the strain DA5-61 (his5, ade1, ura3, alk5::URA3/alk5::ADE1) from the parental strain CHAU1. The growth phenotype of the strains DA23-81 and DA5-61 as well as theALK1-disrupted strain DA1-44 (17Ohkuma M. Hikiji T. Tanimoto T. Schunck W.-H. Müller H.-G. Yano K. Takagi M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 1757-1764PubMed Google Scholar) are shown in TableII. All of these strains were able to utilize at least medium and long chain n-alkanes (C14 and C16) as sole carbon sources for growth, indicating that none of the three loci (ALK1, ALK2-ALK3, and ALK5) was solely essential for n-alkane-assimilating ability of C. maltosa. However, it was obvious that the growth of the strain DA1-44 showed significant but weak growth on then-alkane of short chain length (C12) compared with the parental and the other strains.Table IIGrowth properties of cytochrome P450alk gene disruptants on n-alkanes of different chain lengthsStrainP450 form expressedCarbon sourcen-Dodecanen-Tetradecanen-HexadecaneCHAU1ALK1, ALK2, ALK3, ALK5+++DA1–44ALK2, ALK3, ALK5+/−++DA23–81ALK1, ALK5+++DA5–61ALK1, ALK2, ALK3+++DA15–23ALK2, ALK3+/−++DA123–14ALK5−+/−+DA235–24ALK1+++DA1235–12None−−− Open table in a new tab To investigate the cellular function of individual P450alk isoforms, the respective P450alk genes had to be disrupted simultaneously within a single strain. However, because the initial round of disruption resulted in a Ura+ and Ade+ phenotype and only theHIS5 marker was available, methods to restore the selectable markers to the disrupted strains should have been developed to permit reutilization of the markers for further disruption of the remaining P450alk genes. In one method, the introduced selectable markerADE1 was substituted for a deletion derivative of it by means of cotransformation with a selectable plasmid to facilitate the selection of the replacement. The ADE1-deleting cassette alk2-alk3::Δade1 was transformed into strain DA23-81 along with anHIS5-containing autonomously replicating plasmid, pBTH10B (15Hikiji T. Ohkuma M. Takagi M. Yano K. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Among the resulting His+ transformants, some developed red colored colonies characteristic of the ade1mutant. They were tested for adenine auxotrophy, and the appropriate replacement with the alk2-alk3::Δade1 cassette was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA of an Ade− strain, DA23-816 (Fig. 2, lane 4). Then, the plasmid pBTH10B was cured from the strain DA23-816 by growth on nonselective medium. The other methods used for the regeneration of a selectable marker in a single strain were based on the selectability of an ura3mutant by their resistance to 5FOA, a toxic analog of an intermediate in the uracil synthetic pathway. Application of the 5FOA selection of aura3 mutant in C. maltosa has already been shown in a previous report (18Ohkuma M. Muraoka S. Hwang C.W. Ohta A. Takagi M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Spontaneous 5FOA-resistant strains were selected from the strain DA23-816, and their uracil requirement was tested. Southern blot analysis of a Ura− strain, DA23-8164, indicated that this strain was homozygous foralk2-alk3::Δade1 (Fig. 2, lane 5). As previously shown, a recombination event between both alleles occurred frequently during the selection of 5FOA resistance (18Ohkuma M. Muraoka S. Hwang C.W. Ohta A. Takagi M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The strain DA23-8146 (his5, ade1, ura3, alk2-alk3::Δade1/alk2-alk3::Δade1) was devoid of ALK2-ALK3 in both alleles; nevertheless, three selectable markers could be utilized further in this strain. Mutants containing multiple P450alk gene disruption were generated according to the scheme shown in Fig. 1. The complete set of disruption in all the three P450alk loci, ALK1, ALK2-ALK3, and ALK5, was obtained by sequential disruption. The complete genotypes of the strains generated are listed in Table I. In each step, the appropriate genotypes were confirmed by Southern blot analysis of the isolated strains (see “Experimental Procedures”), as shown in the case of the ALK2-ALK3 disruption. The growth properties of P450alk gene disruptants onn-alkanes of different chain lengths as sole carbon sources were examined (see Table II). Strain DA1235-12, in which all four of the genes were disrupted, could not utilize n-alkanes of any chain lengths for growth, although this strain was able to grow onn-alcohols and fatty acids as sole carbon sources. The growth property of this strain indicated that the sequential gene disruption resulted in a complete functional block of then-alkane assimilation at the first step. Strains DA123-14, DA235-24, and DA15–23, in which two of the three loci were disrupted, showed good growth on C16, indicating that each of the products of the three loci was alone sufficient for the assimilation of long chain n-alkane. Interestingly, a specificity of the n-alkane-assimilating property was observed depending on the chain length of n-alkanes. The strain DA123-14 could not utilize C12 at all for growth, whereas the other strains grew significantly on this substrate, although some of them showed weak growth. And the strain DA123-14 alone showed weak growth on C14. This growth property of the strain DA123-14 indicated that the ALK5 product that remained functional in this strain could function fully only on the long chain n-alkane. Strains devoid of ALK1 showed merely poor growth on C12, whereas strains expressing ALK1 showed good growth on C12. These results indicated that the ALK1 product played an important role for assimilation of short chain n-alkanes. To prove the expression of spectrally active P450 in the gene disruptant strains, P450s were induced by C12 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Whereas the wild-type strain CHAU1 expressed a significant amount of P450 (0."

Furthermore, IL-2 stimulation increased the level of interaction of phosphorylated Cbl with the p85 SH2 domains, and we provide evidence that the preformed Cbl-Grb2 complex recruits the phosphorylated p52 Shc adaptor protein.In addition, we demonstrate that the SH2-SH3-SH3 adaptor protein CrkL is tyrosine-phosphorylated in an IL-2-dependent manner and, via its SH2 domain, associates with a large proportion of phosphorylated Cbl. We also show that p85 is preassociated with the CrkL SH3 domain. Furthermore, the association of CrkL and p85 is increased after IL-2 treatment by a mechanism involving intermediary tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that remain to be identified. Our results show that CrkL associates independently with Cbl or p85 and suggest that it also participates in larger complexes containing Cbl and p85.Although the precise roles of Cbl and CrkL remain to be elucidated, their tyrosine phosphorylation, in addition to the multiple protein interactions described here, strongly suggest that Cbl and CrkL may play pivotal roles in the early steps of IL-2 signal transduction.

IL-2 signal transduction is initiated by the β- and γ-chains and has been widely studied in the past few years. The first steps of IL-2 signaling depend upon activation of the JAK and Src family kinases, which presumably phosphorylate the receptor itself and lead to activation of the Stat and Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, respectively (2Taniguchi T.

This increased activity is best detectable in anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoprecipitates, indicating either that the p85 subunit of PI3K becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues or that it binds to phosphoproteins in response to IL-2 (8Merida I.

During the course of studies aimed at further defining IL-2 signal transduction, we observed IL-2-inducible phosphorylation of an approximately 120-kDa protein that appeared as a major tyrosine kinase substrate in T lymphocytes. Since the p120-Cbl oncogene product has previously been reported to be phosphorylated in response to various stimuli and can associate with p85-PI3K, we investigated whether Cbl might be involved in IL-2 signaling. c-Cbl was first identified as the cellular homolog of the murine Cas NS-1 retrovirus oncogene (11Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse III, H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Its protein product, p120-Cbl contains several domains of interest, including a nuclear localization signal, a zinc finger, and a leucine zipper, suggesting that Cbl might function as a transcription factor, although no direct evidence for such an activity has yet been reported (12Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, Cbl contains a proline-rich motif and several potentially phosphorylatable tyrosine residues that could mediate protein-protein interactions (13Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse III, H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed the proline-rich motif has been shown to be recognized by various SH3 domains, in particular those present in the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Nck, Src, and p85-PI3K (14Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A.

Members of this family include two different splice products from the c-crk gene, Crk-I and Crk-II, as well as the related protein CrkL (21Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T.

Although the function of p120-Cbl in signal transduction remains to be elucidated, p120-Cbl has clearly been shown to become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in BCR-ABL transformed cells (24Andoniou C.E Thien C.B.

Furthermore, triggering of a number of cell membrane receptors in hemopoietic cells also leads to Cbl phosphorylation. These include the antigen receptors on B (membrane Ig) and T (TCR-CD3) lymphocytes (32Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Soltoff S. Reedquist K. Druker B. Shoelson S. Cantley L. Band H. J. Biol.

In this report we have used the human IL-2-dependent Kit 225 T lymphocyte and NKL natural killer cell lines to investigate the regulation of Cbl by interleukin-2. We report here that p120-Cbl is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-2 stimulation in these cells. In addition, Cbl is constitutively associated with Grb2, and IL-2 stimulation induces the recruitment of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc to the Cbl-Grb2 complex. Finally, IL-2 stimulation appears to regulate the ability of Cbl to associate with p85-PI3K in vitro and in vivo. IL-2 also induces the phosphorylation of CrkL and regulates its association with p85 and Cbl through different molecular interactions. Thus, our study identifies Cbl and CrkL as important tyrosine kinase substrates in IL-2-responsive cells and suggests that Cbl and CrkL, which associate with multiple partners, may function as essential docking proteins in IL-2 signal transduction. The human T cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived, IL-2-dependent Kit 225 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. T. Hori (Kyoto University, Japan; Ref.36Hori T. Uchiyama T. Tsudo M. Umadome H.

The NKL cell line, established from the peripheral blood of a patient with large granular lymphocyte leukemia, was kindly provided by Dr. J. Ritz (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; Ref. 37Robertson M.J. Cochran K.J. Cameron C. Le J.M. Tantravahi R. Ritz J. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 406-415PubMed Google Scholar). Kit 225 and NKL cells were maintained in culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics) supplemented with 0.5 nmrecombinant human IL-2 (generously provided by P. Ferrara, Sanofi, France). Cells were deprived of IL-2 by washing three times and resuspending the cells in culture medium without IL-2 at 5 × 105/ml for 48 h. The Jurkat human T cell line was grown in culture medium. IL-2-deprived Kit 225 or NKL cells were resuspended in culture medium at 2 × 107/ml and incubated at 37 °C without (control) or with 1 nmrecombinant IL-2 for various periods of time as specified. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed at 5 × 107/ml in cold 0.5% Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm vanadate, and 5 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). Lysis was performed for 30 min on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Jurkat cells, resuspended at 2 × 107/ml, were stimulated for the indicated times by incubation with UCHT-1 antibody at 10 μg/ml and lysed as described above. Polyclonal antibodies against Cbl (Sc-170), Grb2 (Sc-422, used for immunoprecipitation), and CrkL (Sc-319) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to Grb2 (G 16720, used in Western blot) and Crk-I/II (C 12620) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-p85 antiserum (catalog number 06-195) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), and the anti-CD3 UCHT-1 antibody was from Immunotech (Marseille, France). The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was initially provided by Dr. B. Druker (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR), and additional supplies were purchased from UBI. The tyrosine 317 phosphopeptide (PSpYVNVPD) derived from the human Shc protein, and the proline-rich peptide (VPPPVPPRRR) derived from the human SOS protein were synthesized as described previously (38Goudreau N.

After 2 h of rocking at 4 °C, 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose was added, and incubation continued for an additional 45 min. Beads were washed five times with cold lysis buffer, and the precipitates were boiled in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Corp.). Immunodepletion experiments were performed by three successive rounds of immunoprecipitation using protein G-Sepharose-adsorbed antibodies, followed by one round with beads alone, and the final immunoprecipitation was performed on the supernatant as described above. For immunoblotting, the membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature in either 5% nonfat dry milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.5% Tween (TBS-T). Filters were washed four times in TBS-T and incubated for 1.5 h with optimal concentrations of primary antibodies diluted in TBS, 0.1% Tween. Following four additional washes in TBS-T, the filters were further incubated for 45 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (sheep anti-mouse Ig from Amersham or goat anti-rabbit Ig from DAKO). Visualization was performed using Amersham ECL reagents and autoradiographic films. A plasmid encoding for GST-Grb2 full-length fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. P-O. Couraud (Institut Cochin de Génétique Moléculaire, Paris, France). GST-CrkL constructs (CrkL (full-length), SH2, and N-terminal) were a kind gift from B. J. Druker (40Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of GST-p85 will be described in detail elsewhere. 2F. Gesbert and J. Bertoglio, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the cDNA for human p85α and its various subdomains was amplified by PCR, and appropriate fragments were cloned into PGEX vectors (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to yield fusion proteins containing the full-length p85 (GST-p85), the SH3 domain (GST-SH3; amino acid residues 1–83), the BCR homology domain framed by the two proline-rich regions (GST-PBP; residues 73–336), and the two-SH2-containing C-terminal half of p85 (GST-SH2(N + C); residues 313–724). GST fusion proteins were produced and purified as described previously (41Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). 5–10 μg of purified GST proteins were adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). Precleared lysates were rocked with coupled beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 5 times with lysis buffer and boiled in 2 × sample buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Western blot analysis of total cell lysates from IL-2-stimulated Kit 225 cells with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 showed a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of approximately 120 kDa (not shown). The possibility that this 120-kDa signal contained Cbl was directly investigated by immunoprecipitation with anti-Cbl or 4G10 (anti-phosphotyrosine) antibodies and Western blotting with the reciprocal antibody. Fig.1 A shows that indeed Cbl was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in a stimulation-dependent manner and could be recovered in 4G10 immunoprecipitates of IL-2-stimulated cell lysates. The kinetics of Cbl phosphorylation was then studied, and the results shown in Fig.1 B indicated that phosphorylation was detected as soon as 30 s, peaking around 10 min after IL-2 stimulation and slightly declining thereafter but still present for up to 60 min. To estimate the amount of Cbl that became phosphorylated in response to IL-2, two successive anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates were performed with lysates obtained from 2 × 107 cells, pooled, and run in parallel with total cell lysates from varying numbers of cells, and the Western blot developed with anti-Cbl antiserum was analyzed by densitometry scanning (data not shown). This series of experiments showed that approximately 2% of total Cbl could be immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies following IL-2 stimulation. Cbl also became tyrosine-phosphorylated in NKL cells, another IL-2-dependent human cell line derived from natural killer lymphocytes (Fig. 1 B). Similar data were obtained in human phytohemagglutinin T cell blasts and murine CTLL-2 cells (not shown), demonstrating that Cbl phosphorylation is a general event in IL-2 signaling and excluding the possibility that these observations might result from unique and unidentified features of Kit 225 cells. To investigate whether Cbl associates with other phosphorylated proteins in response to IL-2, Cbl immunoprecipitations were performed under conditions slightly modified from those shown in Fig. 1. Cell lysates from 5 × 107 Kit 225 cells corresponding to 5 times more proteins were used for each immunoprecipitation point. Under these conditions, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting revealed two additional bands that specifically co-precipitated with Cbl (Fig.2 A). One band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 70–75 kDa appears associated with Cbl regardless of IL-2 stimulation and has so far not been identified. The other band migrated around 50–52 kDa at the same position as a signal present in anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates (open arrowheads), suggesting that it might be the adaptor protein Shc. Indeed Shc associates with the Grb2 SH2 domain and is known to be phosphorylated in response to IL-2 (42Burns L.A. Karnitz L.M. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17659-17661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1599-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphocytes do not express the p66 isoform of Shc, and p52 Shc migrates very close to the immunoglobulin heavy chain signal (position indicated by Ig-H on all figures), making it difficult to identify by direct blotting of immunoprecipitates. To formally identify this band as Shc, immune complexes obtained with anti-Cbl antibodies were dissociated by boiling in 2% SDS, and the eluted proteins were diluted 20-fold in lysis buffer and reprecipitated with anti-Shc antibodies. As seen in Fig.2 B, the 52-kDa phosphoprotein present in Cbl immunoprecipitate was indeed recognized by the anti-Shc antibody in the second immunoprecipitation and migrated exactly at the same level as phosphorylated p52Shc in the positive control experiment. The IL-2-induced interaction of Shc with Cbl led us to investigate whether Cbl might be associated with Grb2 in Kit 225 cells. Initial experiments indeed showed that Cbl immunoprecipitates contained Grb2, and Grb2 immunoprecipitates contained Cbl, although the association appeared to occur with a low stoichiometry. To better analyze this interaction, Cbl and Grb2 immunoprecipitates were split in two fractions of 1/10 and 9/10 of the material, which were run in parallel gels. The membrane containing 1/10 of the Cbl immunoprecipitates and 9/10 of the Grb2 immunoprecipitates was blotted with Cbl antibodies (Fig. 2 C, top), and the membrane containing 1/10 of the Grb2 immunoprecipitates and 9/10 of the Cbl immunoprecipitates was blotted with Grb2 antibodies (Fig. 2 C, bottom). This approach, combined with densitometry scanning indicated that approximately 3% of total Grb2 was associated with Cbl. To further understand how Cbl interacts with Grb2 and Shc, GST-Grb2 fusion proteins were incubated with cell lysates from resting or IL-2-stimulated cells, and the nature of binding proteins was assessed by Western blot. The pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that bound to GST-Grb2 was quite complex (Fig. 2 D) and very similar to that seen in Grb2 immunoprecipitates (Fig.2 A). Of particular interest, a 120-kDa signal appears, depending upon IL-2 stimulation, which represents phosphorylated Cbl. Reprobing the same membrane with anti-Cbl antibodies demonstrated that Cbl actually associates with GST-Grb2 regardless of IL-2 stimulation. Thus, as suggested by the immunoprecipitation experiments described above, Grb2/Cbl interaction is independent of Cbl phosphorylation. To analyze the respective involvement of Grb2 SH3 and SH2 domains in the observed protein interactions, we took advantage of the ability of defined peptide sequences to selectively block each of these domains. A proline-rich peptide derived from the SOS protein was used to block Grb2 SH3 domains, and a phosphorylated tyrosine 317-containing peptide derived from Shc was used to block Grb2 SH2 as described under “Materials and Methods.” Control experiments performed with GST-Grb2 indicated that the proline-rich peptide, when added at a concentration of 100 μm, clearly prevented the binding of Cbl to GST-Grb2, whereas the Shc-derived phosphorylated peptide reduced the binding of Shc but had no effect on Cbl binding to Grb2 (not shown). To understand the nature of Cbl/Grb2/Shc interactions in vivo, we investigated the effects of these two peptides on the formation of this complex in resting and IL-2-stimulated cells. To this end, appropriate concentrations of each of these peptides were added to cell lysates, and Cbl was immunoprecipitated (Fig.3). In the presence of the proline-rich peptide, Grb2 became undetectable in the Cbl immunoprecipitate, indicating that the Cbl/Grb2 interaction was dramatically displaced by the SOS peptide (lanes 5–6). Under these conditions, however, all of the Grb2 may not be prevented from binding as suggested by the presence of a residual amount of phosphorylated Shc. Adding the phosphorylated Shc peptide also yielded very clear cut results. This peptide did not affect the Cbl/Grb2 interaction at all yet completely removed Shc from the immunoprecipitated complex (lanes 7 and 8). Adding both peptides together induced a complete dissociation of Grb2 and Shc from Cbl. Taken together, the results of this series of experiments demonstrated that the Cbl/Grb2 interaction is probably mediated through recognition of Cbl proline-rich sequences by Grb2 SH3 domains and that IL-2-dependent phosphorylation of Shc induces its association, through the Grb2 SH2 domain, to the preformed Cbl-Grb2 complex. These experiments also showed that the unidentified pp70–75 probably does not interact directly with Cbl but might be bound to the complex through interaction with the Grb2 SH2. Indeed, it was completely absent from the Cbl immunoprecipitate whether Grb2 was displaced by the SOS peptide or in the presence of the phosphorylated Shc peptide (Fig.3). Since Cbl has been shown to associate with p85-PI3K in response to various stimuli, we investigated whether this was also the case in IL-2-stimulated Kit 225. The modification of Cbl-p85 interaction induced by IL-2 in Kit 225 cells was somewhat difficult to study, since no Cbl could be detected in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates, whether cells were stimulated or not. However, the converse experiment indicated that a small proportion of p85 could be precipitated by Cbl antibodies. Although not seen on the exposure shown in Fig.4 A, but confirmed in Fig.5, the Cbl/p85 association was detected at a low level in resting cells. Furthermore, IL-2 induced a clear increase of the amount of p85 present in the Cbl immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4 A, lanes 11 and 12). Because of the relative weakness of these signals, we sought to compare the effects of IL-2 stimulation to those induced by triggering the TCR-CD3 complex in Jurkat cells, which have been well described (44Hartley D. Meisner H. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18260-18263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The effects of CD3 stimulation could not be assessed directly with Kit 225 cells, which do not respond to stimulation by the UCHT-1 antibody, and these experiments were therefore performed in Jurkat cells. In these cells, Cbl is constitutively phosphorylated to a fairly high level (data not shown) and associated with p85 regardless of stimulation as seen in Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 5. Nevertheless, stimulation of Jurkat cells with the anti-CD3 UCHT-1 antibody resulted in a detectable increase in Cbl phosphorylation (not shown) and in an increased association with p85. This was best evidenced by Cbl immunoblotting of anti-p85 immunoprecipitates (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and 4, top), and some increase in p85 was also seen in Cbl immunoprecipitates (lanes 5 and 6). Thus, we have shown that in Kit 225 cells, IL-2 regulates Cbl/p85 interaction, albeit to a significantly smaller extent than TCR stimulation does in Jurkat cells.Figure 5Association of Cbl with Crk proteins and phosphorylation of CrkL in IL-2-stimulated cells. Kit 225 cells were left untreated (−) or were stimulated for 5 min. with IL-2 and lysed. Lysates from 5 × 107 cells were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-9% PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filter was cut into different size regions and probed with the indicated antibodies (Cbl, p85, CrkL, Crk I/II (referred as Crk), and Grb2). The top panel shows the same experiment performed in parallel and probed with 4G10 antibody. The position of Cbl is indicated, and the arrow shows the migration of the phosphorylated form of CrkL. Note that the signal seen in the Grb2 blot of Crk immunoprecipitates is not Grb2 but the Ig light chain of the monoclonal Crk antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further analyze how Cbl interacts with p85-PI3K, we used several GST fusion proteins consisting of the individual subdomains of p85, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fusion proteins were incubated with lysates from resting or IL-2-stimulated Kit 225 cells, and Cbl was revealed by Western blotting as above. As shown in Fig.4 B (bottom), GST-p85, as well as GST-SH3, recognized Cbl in lysates from nonstimulated cells, whereas control GST, GST-PBP, or GST-SH2(N+C) did not pull down Cbl. Furthermore, the amount of Cbl binding to GST-p85 increased in IL-2-stimulated cell lysates and GST-SH2(N + C) bound Cbl only when it was phosphorylated, i.e. in IL-2-stimulated cells.

We found that ARF6 localizes in both the cytosol and membranes of all tissues and cells tested. Moreover, ARF6 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is principally localized on the plasma membrane, but substantial amounts are detected in the cytosolic and intracellular membrane fractions. We observed an increased expression of ARF6 during the differentiation of B lymphocytes to plasmocytes. However, the expression of ARF6 decreased during adipogenesis and monocyte differentiation. In contrast, the expression of other ARFs, detected by the monoclonal antibody 1D9, did not significantly change during differentiation of the aforementioned cell types. Taken together, our results indicate that ARF6 is a broadly expressed, differentially regulated GTPase that is present in cytoplasm and on both cell-surface and intracellular membranes and whose functions may include tissue-specific effects on vesicular trafficking during cellular differentiation.

ADP-ribosylation factors are members of the Ras superfamily of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins.

Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they have been shown to play an important role in membrane trafficking. Six mammalian ARF genes have been identified, of which five corresponding proteins have been found in humans. The most extensively studied is ARF1, which has been used, almost exclusively, to study the biology of ARFs. This protein appears to cycle between the cytosol and its membrane targets in the Golgi apparatus (2Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 3Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ARF regulates membrane trafficking along the secretory pathway by facilitating coatomer binding to Golgi membranes and by maintaining the integrity of the Golgi complex (5Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 6Cockroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). ARFs also stimulate the activity of phospholipase D in vitro(7Kahn R.A. Yucel J.K. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 75: 1045-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar, 9Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may exert their effects at least in part by altering membrane phospholipid metabolism. ARF6 has been suggested to play a role in vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal organization (10D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G.P. Colombo M. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 11Peters P. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J.

J. 1997; 17: 5445-5454Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Overexpressed ARF6 is localized on the plasma membrane and endosomes, suggesting a role for this protein in membrane trafficking along the endocytic pathway (10D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G.P. Colombo M. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 11Peters P. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, a recent report suggested that endogenous ARF6 is exclusively localized on the plasma membrane in CHO cells (14Cavenagh M.M. Whiteney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Others have found that ARF6 is localized on chromaffin granules, suggesting that it mediates exocytosis during regulated secretion (15Galas M.-C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Based on the above results, it appears that ARF6 has a cell type-dependent subcellular distribution. To investigate this question further, we developed an ARF6 monoclonal antibody that allowed us to determine the subcellular localization of endogenous ARF6 in various cells and tissues and its expression during cellular differentiation. We demonstrate that ARF6 is recovered in cytosolic and membrane fractions in all cells and tissues tested. In addition, we found that the expression of ARF6 is ubiquitous and differentially regulated during cellular differentiation. We postulate that ARF6 might play a role in membrane trafficking by a mechanism in which it transiently shuttles between the cytosol and various membrane compartments. Recombinant human ARF6 protein was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified by two successive columns: anion exchange on DEAE-Sepharose and gel filtration on Sepharose 100. Purified recombinant ARF6 was used for immunization of BALB/c mice (Charles Rivers Laboratories) following standard procedures. Cell fusions and cultures were performed at the Hybridoma Center at Washington University. Culture supernatants from hybridomas positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used for immunoblotting to test their specificity for ARF6. Eight clones specific for ARF6 were obtained after three rounds of cloning by limited dilution. Only one of these, termed 3F8.1, was used in this study. The IgG fraction was purified from ascites of mice injected with hybridoma 3F8.1 by affinity chromatography on a protein G-agarose column. The purified antibody was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Mice (female or male C57/Black 6 (6–8 weeks old); Charles River Laboratories) were killed by cervical dislocation. Spleens were mechanically dissociated, and cell clumps and debris were removed from the cell suspension by gravity sedimentation for 5 min. Spleen cells were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min. Different populations of spleen cells were separated by Percoll (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) density gradient centrifugation. Cells located at the interface between 60 and 70% Percoll (resting B lymphocytes) were collected and washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Spleen B cells and A-20 lymphoma were differentiated for 2 days (5 × 105 cells/ml) or 5 days (105 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% calf serum, 25 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. LPS (25 μg/ml) was further added on the third day to the cells differentiated for 5 days. Dead cells were removed by centrifugation through a Ficoll (Sigma) cushion at 1800 rpm for 18 min. Cell viability for each experiment, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, was >90%. HL-60 cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Maturation of HL-60 cells was induced as described by Maridonneau-Parini et al. (16Maridonneau-Parini I. Yang C.Z. Bornens M. Goud B. J. Clin. Invest. Z. 1991; 87: 901-907CCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, HL-60 cells were cultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and exposed to 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 4 days. The differentiated cells were collected with a rubber policeman and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, was >80%. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% calf serum and differentiated to adipocytes by an established protocol (17Shisheva A. Czech M.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6564-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% calf serum. Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 670 nm insulin, 25 nm dexamethasone, and 500 μm isobutylmethylxanthine for 2 days to induce differentiation. Fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added every 2 days. Cells were used between 8 and 12 days after the removal of the differentiation medium. The post-nuclear supernatant (PNS), crude cytosol, and membranes were prepared as described previously (18Yang C.Z. Mayau V. Godeau F. Goud B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose) plus 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a mixture of protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin, antipain, and pepstatin at 1 μg/ml final concentrations) at 4 °C by 10 strokes in a ball-bearing homogenizer. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min to eliminate unbroken cells, nuclei, and cell debris. The PNS was centrifuged at 150,000 × gfor 1 h at 4 °C to generate cytosolic and membrane fractions. Rat tissues (except testis) were mechanically dissociated and then homogenized by five strokes in a Dounce homogenizer in HES buffer. Rat testis tissue was homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in the same buffer. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice with HES buffer at 4 °C and gently scrapped with a policeman in HES buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. Subcellular fractionation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was performed as described previously (19Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenization was performed by 10 strokes in a Potter homogenizer with a Teflon pestle. After removal of the unbroken cells by a 5-min centrifugation at 400 × g, the homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The 16,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 44,000 × g. The pellet was recovered as HDMs, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 210,000 × g for 75 min to obtain the LDM fraction. The 16,000 × g pellets were suspended in HES buffer and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 ×g. This pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, loaded onto a sucrose cushion (32% sucrose in HES buffer), and centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The plasma membrane located between the two layers of sucrose was collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g. The protein concentration of the fractions was measured by the BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out essentially as described by O'Farrell (20O'Farrell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. For isoelectric focusing, a mixture of 1% Pharmalyte, pH 6–8 and pH 3–10 (Sigma), was used; for electrophoresis, 14% SDS-PAGE was used. Bovine serum albumin was added to all samples as an internal standard. For SDS-PAGE, samples were diluted in sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on 14% gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. The sheets were incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with blocking buffer (5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (diluted with 1:4 blocking buffer/phosphate-buffered saline). After four washes (15 min each) with buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), the nitrocellulose sheets were incubated for 1 h with a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG), washed as described above, and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.). 125I-Labeled secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG) was used to detect ARF6 in CHO cells (as described for Fig. 3 A). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose as described above. Nitrocellulose sheets were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.3% Tween 20, 5 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm ATP. Incubation with 1 μCi/ml [α-32P]GTP was carried out for 1 h in the same buffer. Nitrocellulose filters were then washed four times (10 min each) with the same buffer, dried, and autoradiographed at −80 °C. Although several previous studies have reported on the subcellular distribution and cellular effects of overexpressed ARF6 (10D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G.P. Colombo M. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 11Peters P. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J.

J. 1997; 17: 5445-5454Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar), the localization and function of endogenous ARF6 remain incompletely understood (14Cavenagh M.M. Whiteney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,15Galas M.-C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we generated a monoclonal antibody against purified recombinant human ARF6 expressed in P. pastoris. As shown in Fig. 1 A, clone 3F8.1 specifically reacted with ARF6, and no cross-reaction was found with other known members of the ARF family that were expressed in bacteria. To confirm that 3F8.1 does not cross-react with unidentified ARFs, we tested its specificity by two-dimensional PAGE. As shown in Fig.1 B, only one spot of 19 kDa with an isoelectric point of 8.6 could be detected in a total lysate of rat lung, indicating that 3F8.1 is specific for ARF6 and that the antibody is not directed against the highly conserved domains of the ARF proteins. To date, two groups have reported on the subcellular localization of endogenous ARF6 in CHO cells (14Cavenagh M.M. Whiteney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (15Galas M.-C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In CHO cells, endogenous ARF6 was localized exclusively on the plasma membrane. However, the second study reported that ARF6 is associated with secretory granules in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. These results suggest a cell type-dependent subcellular localization of endogenous ARF6. To further address this question, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of ARF6 in six rat tissues using the 3F8.1 antibody (Fig.2). Although the level of expression of ARF6 varied from one tissue to another, the protein was detectable in all tissues analyzed. This result is in agreement with the finding that mRNA encoding ARF6 is detectable in all mouse tissues analyzed (21Hosaka M. Toda K. Takatsu H. Torii S. Murakami K. Kakayma K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, when equivalent quantities of cytosolic and membrane proteins obtained from 50 μg of post-nuclear supernatant were used for ARF6 blot analysis, a significant percentage of total cellular ARF6 was found in the cytosol in all tissues tested, although this percentage varied from 12% (spleen) to 50% (liver and lung). To determine whether the cytosolic distribution of ARF6 was specific only for rat tissues, the subcellular distribution of ARF6 was analyzed in other cell types. First, ARF6 distribution in CHO cells was examined. As shown in Fig. 3 A(left panel), a short exposure time (12 h) of the immunoblot showed an exclusive membrane-associated distribution of ARF6 in these cells. However, after a longer exposure time (3 days), we indeed found that ∼5% of the total ARF6 was in the cytosol (Fig. 3 A, right panel). We further analyzed ARF6 distribution in another cell line, J774 macrophages. Surprisingly, ARF6 was equally distributed between the cytosol and membranes (Fig. 3 B). Total membrane and cytosolic fractions were also prepared from nondifferentiated and LPS-differentiated mouse B lymphocytes (described below). Equivalent quantities of cytosol and membranes obtained from 50 μg of PNS were analyzed by Western blotting. We found that ARF6 was distributed equally between the cytosolic and membrane fractions both in nondifferentiated B lymphocytes and after 2 days of exposure to LPS. However, the fraction of membrane-associated ARF6 was greatly increased in B lymphocytes after 5 days of exposure to LPS (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, our results showed that the quantity of ARF6 localized in the cytosol varies substantially from one cell type to another. To further explore the subcellular distribution of ARF6, we analyzed the localization of ARF6 in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a cell type amenable to subcellular fractionation and the preparation of relatively enriched fractions. The plasma membrane, LDMs (mixture of endosomes, secretory vesicles, and Golgi apparatus), cytosol, and HDMs (mixture of endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, and small fraction endosomes) were prepared following established procedures (19Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the same amounts of proteins of the plasma membrane, LDM, cytosolic, and HDM fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting, ARF6 was found predominantly in the plasma membrane fraction, with lesser amounts in the cytosolic, HDM, and LDM fractions (Fig. 4). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, ∼80% of the total cellular protein is cytosolic, and when crude cytosol and membranes were analyzed for ARF6 expression, we found that ∼20–30% of ARF6 was present in the cytosol (data not shown). Since the plasma membrane marker Na+-ATPase was not detectable in LDMs and was detectable at very low levels in HDMs (data not shown), the presence of ARF6 in LDMs and HDMs indicates that endogenous ARF6 has abone fide intracellular localization in addition to its plasma membrane localization in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Morphological studies will be vital to determine the exact subcellular organelles to which ARF6 is localized. The varied expression and differential subcellular localization of ARF6 in the tissues and cells analyzed above prompted us to examine its level of expression during cell differentiation. For these studies, mouse B lymphocytes were differentiated to Ig-secreting plasmocytes by stimulation with LPS. Differentiated B cells have a well developed synthetic/secretory pathway (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus). Plasmocyte differentiation was verified by the production and secretion of IgM. After 5 days of exposure to LPS, >80% of B cells from mouse spleen were positive for IgM (data not shown), and [35S]methionine-pulse-labeled Ig was completely secreted into the medium after a 1-h chase (data not shown), indicating that the B cells were differentiated to plasmocytes that produced and secreted high quantities of IgM. Compared with undifferentiated resting B lymphocytes, differentiated B cells were found to express much higher levels of ARF6. The level of ARF6 in mouse spleen B cells increased with increased exposure to LPS (2.1 ± 0.5- and 3.5 ± 0.4-fold increases over undifferentiated B cells after 2 and 5 days of exposure to LPS, respectively) (Fig. 5 A, upper panel). In contrast, the expression of other ARF proteins was not significantly changed (Fig. 5 A, middle panel), as detected by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody 1D9 (14Cavenagh M.M. Whiteney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which recognizes all known ARF isoforms except ARF4 (Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that in B cells the quantity of ARF6 could be much lower than that of other ARF members. Consequently, a 2–3-fold increase in ARF6 may not significantly change the total amount of ARF. Alternatively, one of the ARFs (ARF1, ARF3, or ARF5) could be decreased during B cell differentiation. Also, the expression of other small GTP-binding proteins, as detected by GTP overlay blotting (Fig. 5 A, lower panel), or Rab proteins, in particular, as detected by immunoblotting, 2C. Z. Yang and B. Goud, unpublished data. did not increase during B cell differentiation. To rule out the possibility of contamination of B lymphocytes by other cell types from mouse spleen, the B lymphoma cell line A-20 was also differentiated by exposure to LPS. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the expression of ARF6 also greatly increased after a 2-day exposure to LPS (2.3 ± 0.4-fold increase over undifferentiated cells), and we observed a very slight increase from 2 to 5 days of treatment (2.3 ± 0.4 to 2.7 ± 0.6-fold increase over undifferentiated cells). Thus, the level of ARF6 expression was very similar during the differentiation of mouse spleen B cells and A-20 B lymphoma cells, which suggests that our B lymphocyte preparation from mouse spleen was highly enriched and not heavily contaminated by other cells types. The expression of ARFs (detected by 1D9) and small GTP-binding proteins (detected by GTP overlay blotting) was not altered (data not shown). To delineate that increased expression of ARF6 is commonly associated with cell differentiation, we further examined the level of ARF6 expression in other differentiating cell types. Two other examples of cell-type differentiation were chosen to study the expression of ARF6: 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and HL-60 cells. Murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated to adipocytes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 3T3-L1 adipocytes have induced expression of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter isoform 4 (Glut4) and respond to insulin by enhanced Glut4 translocation from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane (22Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Insulin has also been shown to stimulate the accumulation of transferrin receptors and insulin-like growth factor II receptors on the cell surface (23Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, adipocytes also secrete several proteins potentially important in homeostatic control of glucose and lipid metabolism. Complement factors C3 and B are secreted by adipocytes. Adipsin, equivalent to factor D of the alternative complement pathway, is synthesized exclusively in adipocytes, and its secretion is enhanced severalfold by insulin (24Kitagawa K. Rosen B.S. Spiegelman B.M. Lienhard G.E. Tanner L.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1014: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, 3T3-L1 adipocytes have an enhanced recycling and secretory activity compared with 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. As illustrated in Fig.6 A (upper panel), ARF6 expression could be detected in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but its expression was much lower than in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. This is consistent with a previous report that the level of ARF6 mRNA was reduced during 3T3-L1 differentiation, suggesting that the decrease of ARF6 protein in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes may result from changes at the level of transcription (25Schurmann A. Breiner M. Becker W. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Kentrup H. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15683-15688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots with 1D9 showed that the overall expression of ARF GTPases was not significantly altered during adipogenesis (Fig. 6 A, middle panel). Although it has been reported that the levels of Rab3A and Rab3D increase in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared with 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (26Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 27Baldini G. Scherer P. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4284-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the total amount of small GTP-binding proteins, as detected by GTP overlay blotting (Fig.6 A, lower panel), was not significantly altered in these cells. HL-60 human leukemic cells can be induced to differentiate to monocyte-like cells, which have differentiated functions such as phagolysosome formation and directed locomotion that presumably require enhanced organized intracellular traffic (28Singer S.J. Kupfer A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate to monocytes by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 ng/ml) for 4 days. The differentiation was determined by their adhesion to substratum and a substantial increase in the expression of total small GTP-binding proteins (Fig. 6 B, lower panel), as previously reported (16Maridonneau-Parini I. Yang C.Z. Bornens M. Goud B. J. Clin. Invest. Z. 1991; 87: 901-907CCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When equal amounts of total proteins prepared from undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells were used for immunoblotting by the anti-ARF6 monoclonal antibody (3F8.1), the levels of ARF6 unexpectedly decreased in differentiated HL-60 cells (Fig. 6 B, upper panel), whereas those of ARF GTPases detected by 1D9 remained constant (middle panel). These findings suggest that ARF6 expression is not directly linked to the acquisition of the differentiated phenotype found in these cells. Two previous reports (14Cavenagh M.M. Whiteney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Galas M.-C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) allowed us to speculate that endogenous ARF6 has a cell type-dependent subcellular localization. To further investigate this question, we generated an ARF6-specific monoclonal antibody (3F8.1) that can easily detect endogenous ARF6. Using the 3F8.1 monoclonal antibody, we showed that ARF6 localizes in the cytosol in all cell types examined, but the quantity present in the cytosol varied from 5 to 50% of the total ARF6. The question that therefore arises is why previous studies in CHO cells and bovine adrenal chromaffin cells did not report its cytosolic localization. One possibility is that the majority of ARF6 is associated with membranes in these two types of cells. For example, only 5% of ARF6 was found in the cytosol of CHO cells (Fig.3 A). In addition, it is likely that the polyclonal antibody R1471 (14Cavenagh M.M. Whiteney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) could not detect the relatively small amount of ARF6 present in the cytosol. Furthermore, in the study by Galas et al.(15Galas M.-C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), equal amounts of cytosolic and membrane proteins were used for immunoblot analysis instead of equivalent quantities of cytosol and membranes as in our study. This is significant because 70–80% of proteins of the post-nuclear supernatant are cytosolic and ∼20–30% are membrane-associated. Thus, three to four times more cytosolic protein was analyzed in our experiments than in the study by Galaset al. (15Galas M.-C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An important future undertaking will be to confirm the cytosolic localization by immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy, and electromicroscopy since we cannot rule out some artifactual dissociation of ARF6 from membranes to the cytosol during the procedures of cytosol and membrane preparation. We also showed in this study that ARF6 is mainly localized on the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which is similar to its localization in CHO cells (14Cavenagh M.M. Whiteney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition to its plasma membrane localization, we did observe some ARF6 in the cytosol and low density microsomes, which are relatively enriched in endosomes, secretory vesicles, and Golgi apparatus. In addition, Hosaka et al.(21Hosaka M. Toda K. Takatsu H. Torii S. Murakami K. Kakayma K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have also shown intracellular and plasma membrane staining in monkey kidney Vero cells transiently transfected with an ARF6-hemagglutinin construct. However, it has been shown by subcellular fractionation that ARF6 is exclusively localized on granules in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells and that it plays a general role in the exocytotic pathway in endocrine and neuroendocrine cells (15Galas M.-C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Our results combined with previously published reports suggest that ARF6 localization is dependent on cell types in which ARF6 may control different steps of vesicular transport. It will be interesting to compare the subcellular localization of ARF6 in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. If ARF6 displays function-dependent subcellular localization, we would expect to see a varying localization in the same cells in the two differentiated states. We are also in the process of determining whether ARF6 is involved in insulin-sensitive glucose transporter translocation from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. We speculate that the localization of ARF6 on the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is important for the exocytic fusion between Glut4-containing vesicles and the plasma membrane, where ARF6 might regulate fusiogenic lipid metabolism. We have also shown that the expression of ARF6 during cell differentiation varies depending on the cell type examined. Increased expression was observed during plasmocyte differentiation, whereas decreased expression was recorded during the differentiation of HL-60 cells to monocyte-like cells and during adipogenesis. Differentiated plasmocytes have a well developed secretory apparatus including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and higher secretory activity compared with undifferentiated lymphocytes. The increased quantity of ARF6 in plasmocytes and the higher percentage of ARF6 associated with membranes could reflect its involvement in membrane trafficking in these cells, i.e. exocytosis or membrane recycling. Interestingly, the total amount of ARF proteins, as detected by monoclonal antibody 1D9, was not significantly changed, despite the fact that they have been shown to be regulators of the late steps of secretion. One possibility is that the activity of these proteins in plasmocytes is increased independently of the level of their expression. Rab1, Rab2, and Rab6 are proteins that are involved in the synthetic/secretory pathway, but their expression does not increase during plasmocyte differentiation. 3C. Z. Yang and G. Bruno, unpublished data. It will be interesting to determine the activity of appropriate regulatory molecules such as GTPase-activating proteins, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, or GDP dissociation inhibitor for ARF and Rab proteins in plasmocytes compared with resting B lymphocytes. The expression of ARF6 decreased during differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes and of HL-60 human leukemic cells to monocyte-like cells. These results suggested that ARF6 expression is not directly linked to the acquisition of the differentiated phenotype found in these cells. In contrast, the expression of other members of the ARF family did not vary significantly, but certain Rab proteins greatly increased during the differentiation of HL-60 leukemic cells to monocyte-like cells. These findings highlight a potentially attractive feature of small GTP-binding proteins where the regulation of membrane trafficking may involve increased protein levels, changes in subcellular localization, or increased activity via modulation of interacting molecules. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence that endogenous ARF6 is localized in both the cytosol and membranes. These results suggest that endogenous ARF6, similar to other ARFs, undergoes repeated transitions between membrane-bound and soluble states during its activity cycle. In addition, the observation that ARF6 is differentially expressed suggests that ARF6 plays a tissue- or cell-specific role in vesicular trafficking.

The best characterized role of Ub modification is as a means of regulating protein abundance. When a Ub chain forms on a particular substrate protein, that protein is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (for reviews, see Refs. 1Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar, 3Jentsch S. Annu.

Poly-Ub chain formation on a substrate is catalyzed by a member of the ubiquitin conjugating (Ubc) family of proteins, also known as E2 enzymes. Prior to poly-Ub chain formation, Ubc (E2) enzymes are charged with ubiquitin by a ubiquitin activating, or E1, enzyme which has the ability to capture free Ub. In some cases, the transfer of ubiquitin from an Ubc (E2) enzyme to a substrate proceeds via a third protein known as a ubiquitin ligase, or E3 (7Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 8Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity, there are 13 members of the Ubc (E2) family in yeast and these proteins have diverse roles including cell cycle progression, heavy metal resistance, peroxisome biogenesis, and DNA repair. Members of this family have highly related catalytic domains which receive ubiquitin from an E1 and pass it directly, or via an E3, on to a substrate. The noncatalytic carboxyl termini of Ubc enzymes are more variable and are found on only some members of the family. The function of this region is unknown, however, it may be required for substrate recognition or regulation of Ubc activity.Cdc34p, a member of the Ubc family of proteins, is essential for cell cycle progression and primarily acts at the G1 to S-phase transition (9Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Cell cycle progression in yeast is coordinated by the protein kinase, Cdc28p, and the activity of this kinase requires its association with another protein termed cyclin (for review, see Refs.10Nasmyth K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 11Nasmyth K. Trends in Genetics. 1996; 12: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 12Lew D.J. Reed S. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 77-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is thought that the cyclin will determine substrate specificity for the kinase or direct the kinase to particular locations in the cell. In yeast nine cyclins have been characterized for Cdc28p and different cyclins associate with the Cdc28p kinase during different phases of the cell cycle. For example, G1 progression is coordinated by the cyclins Cln1p, Cln2p, and Cln3p that bind and activate Cdc28p. To initiate DNA replication, or S-phase, Cdc28p associates with cyclins Clb5p or Clb6p. Cyclin kinase activity can be negatively regulated by the physical association of an inhibitor (13Hunter T. Cell. 1993; 75: 839-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 14Nasmyth K. Hunt T. Nature. 1993; 366: 634-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Pines J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 143-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One such inhibitor in yeast is Sic1p and this protein negatively regulates the activity of Cdc28p-Clb5p and Cdc28p-Clb6p complexes (16Mendenhall M.D. Science. 1993; 259: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Nugroho T.T.

Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Only upon Sic1p degradation are these complexes active and S-phase initiated.Sic1p is one candidate substrate for Cdc34p-mediated ubiquitin degradation (19Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Cells that lack CDC34 activity are unable to remove Sic1p and thus arrest without initiating DNA replication. This phenotype is shared by cells that lack CDC4 and CDC53 activity. Although their activity is required for Sic1p ubiquitination (19Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), the precise function of these proteins is unknown. CDC53 encodes a protein that defines a family of evolutionary conserved proteins which may serve to recognize substrates that have been targeted for ubiquitination (20Kipreous E.T. Lander L.E.

CDC4encodes a protein containing 7 WD-40 repeats, a motif that has been implicated in protein-protein interactions (23Yochem J. Byers B. J. Mol.

Furthermore, Cdc4p also contains an F-Box, a domain that is the binding site for Skp1p (25Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M.G. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Skp1p is required for the degradation of Sic1p, Cln2p, and Clb5p (25Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M.G. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that a complex containing these proteins is required for the degradation of Sic1p and initiation of S-phase (26King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J-M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Here, we define a region on Cdc34p that is necessary and sufficient for its binding Cdc4p and Cdc53p. We report that Cdc4p, Cdc34p, and Cdc53p form a high molecular weight complex and that this association is required for Cdc34p function. We also show that these three proteins are not only present throughout the cell cycle but that Cdc34p is part of a complex during this process.DISCUSSIONOne essential function of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34p is to attach Ub onto the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1p and thus signal Sic1p for proteolysis. The precise mechanism by which Cdc34p transfers Ub onto Sic1p is not known, however, this process is dependent on at least two other proteins, Cdc4p and Cdc53p. In this report we map a Cdc4p- and Cdc53p-binding domain on Cdc34p and show the importance of in vivo interactions between these three proteins, strengthening the hypothesis that Sic1p ubiquitination is mediated by a multi-protein complex.The Association of Cdc34p with Cdc4p and Cdc53p Is Essential for Cdc34p ActivityWe have defined a Cdc4p/Cdc53p-binding domain on Cdc34p (Fig. 7). This region is not found in other Ubc proteins which suggests that these interactions are unique to Cdc34p. However, the efficiency of Cdc4p and Cdc53p binding to a fusion containing Cdc34p residues 1–209 or residues 171–209 is less than that of a fusion containing full-length Cdc34p. Therefore the remainder of the Cdc34p protein may act to stabilize its association with Cdc4p and Cdc53p. Ptak et al. (34Ptak C. Prendergast J.A. Hodgins R. Kay C.M. Chau V. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26539-26545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that this region is required for Cdc34p dimerization in vitro and it is possible that Cdc4p and Cdc53p bind to a Cdc34p dimer in vivo. Absence of this binding region results in loss of Cdc34p activity and cells are prevented from entering S-phase due to failure to degrade the CDK inhibitor Sic1p. Thus the association of Cdc34p with Cdc4p and Cdc53p is essential for Sic1p ubiquitination. What role does Cdc4p and Cdc53p play in Sic1p ubiquitination? Cdc34p residues 1–170 contain the catalytic domain of Cdc34p and its active site cysteine (Fig. 7). This region has been shown to be charged with ubiquitin by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1 (9Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), an event that does not require Cdc4p or Cdc53p association. Therefore Cdc4p and Cdc53p most likely play a role in transferring Ub from Cdc34p onto its substrates either by substrate recognition or by having a Ub-ligase (E3) activity. Ub-ligases (E3s) have been described (7Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 8Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) yet the sequence comparison of these proteins do not resemble either Cdc4p or Cdc53p. Possibly Cdc53p is required to present the substrate to Cdc34p. Cdc53p has been found to associate with Cln2p, a G1 cyclin that is another candidate Cdc34p substrate (22Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Mathias N. Koybayashi R. Wittenberg C. Tyers M. Cell. 1996; 86: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).Cdc4p, Cdc34p, and Cdc53p Are Members of a Multiprotein ComplexGel filtration analysis shows that Cdc4p, Cdc34p, and Cdc53p are not found as monomers in yeast lysate and take part in associations resulting in the formation of high molecular mass complexes. Overlap of the three proteins' distribution suggests that the Cdc4p·Cdc34p·Cdc53p complex is approximately 400 kDa. This size is greater than that predicted for a complex containing one of each protein (218 kDa), that have a predicted molecular mass of 88, 34, and 96 kDa for Cdc4p, Cdc34p, and Cdc53p, respectively. Therefore either these proteins may act as multimers or additional proteins are part of this complex. Skp1p is required for the ubiquitination of Sic1p and has been shown to bind to Cdc4p through a Cdc4p domain called the F-box (25Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M.G. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). However, Skp1p is only 22 kDa and perhaps other such proteins are required for Cdc34p to interact with Cdc4p and Cdc53p. Significant amounts of Cdc4p and Cdc34p co-fractionate in the absence of Cdc53p and together with our data demonstrating the stabilization of Cdc4p when co-overproduced with Cdc34p suggest that these two proteins form a heterodimer. Again, this association, of approximately 200 kDa may occur in the presence of other proteins. Therefore it appears that components of the Cdc4p·Cdc34p·Cdc53p complex may be separated and be redistributed for distinct ubiquitinating activities.The Cdc34p Complex Is Present throughout the Cell CycleFinally we determined whether Cdc34p existed within a complex throughout the cell cycle. Many cell cycle regulators are themselves only present during specific times of the cell cycle. We have shown here that Cdc4p, Cdc34p, and Cdc53p are present throughout the cell cycle and that Cdc34p appears to reside as part of a complex throughout the cell cycle. Potentially, Cdc34p activity may be required throughout the cell cycle and not just at the G1/S transition in spite of the fact that some of its substrates are degraded in a cell cycle specific manner. Phosphorylation of Sic1p and Cln2p is a prerequisite for these substrates to be ubiquitinated by Cdc34p and Cdc34p activity may be solely regulated by recognizing phosphorylated substrates (38Lanker S. Valdivieso M.H. Wittenberg C. Science. 1996; 271: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 39Schneider, B. L., Yang, Q. H., and Futcher, A. B.Science, 272, 560–562.Google Scholar). Other candidate Cdc34p substrates include Cdc6p (40Piatti S. Bohm T. Cocker J.H. Diffley J.F.X. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), Far1p (41Mckinney J.D. Chang F. Heinzt N. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and Gcn4p (42Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Fink G.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Both Cdc6p and Far1p are degraded in a cell cycle specific manner but outside the G1/S transition and therefore the Cdc34p complex must be active throughout the cell cycle.

Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 8Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity, there are 13 members of the Ubc (E2) family in yeast and these proteins have diverse roles including cell cycle progression, heavy metal resistance, peroxisome biogenesis, and DNA repair. Members of this family have highly related catalytic domains which receive ubiquitin from an E1 and pass it directly, or via an E3, on to a substrate. The noncatalytic carboxyl termini of Ubc enzymes are more variable and are found on only some members of the family. The function of this region is unknown, however, it may be required for substrate recognition or regulation of Ubc activity. Cdc34p, a member of the Ubc family of proteins, is essential for cell cycle progression and primarily acts at the G1 to S-phase transition (9Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Cell cycle progression in yeast is coordinated by the protein kinase, Cdc28p, and the activity of this kinase requires its association with another protein termed cyclin (for review, see Refs.10Nasmyth K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 11Nasmyth K. Trends in Genetics. 1996; 12: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 12Lew D.J. Reed S. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 77-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is thought that the cyclin will determine substrate specificity for the kinase or direct the kinase to particular locations in the cell. In yeast nine cyclins have been characterized for Cdc28p and different cyclins associate with the Cdc28p kinase during different phases of the cell cycle. For example, G1 progression is coordinated by the cyclins Cln1p, Cln2p, and Cln3p that bind and activate Cdc28p. To initiate DNA replication, or S-phase, Cdc28p associates with cyclins Clb5p or Clb6p. Cyclin kinase activity can be negatively regulated by the physical association of an inhibitor (13Hunter T. Cell. 1993; 75: 839-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 14Nasmyth K. Hunt T. Nature. 1993; 366: 634-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Pines J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 143-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One such inhibitor in yeast is Sic1p and this protein negatively regulates the activity of Cdc28p-Clb5p and Cdc28p-Clb6p complexes (16Mendenhall M.D. Science. 1993; 259: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Nugroho T.T.

Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Only upon Sic1p degradation are these complexes active and S-phase initiated. Sic1p is one candidate substrate for Cdc34p-mediated ubiquitin degradation (19Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Cells that lack CDC34 activity are unable to remove Sic1p and thus arrest without initiating DNA replication. This phenotype is shared by cells that lack CDC4 and CDC53 activity. Although their activity is required for Sic1p ubiquitination (19Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), the precise function of these proteins is unknown. CDC53 encodes a protein that defines a family of evolutionary conserved proteins which may serve to recognize substrates that have been targeted for ubiquitination (20Kipreous E.T. Lander L.E.

CDC4encodes a protein containing 7 WD-40 repeats, a motif that has been implicated in protein-protein interactions (23Yochem J. Byers B. J. Mol.

Furthermore, Cdc4p also contains an F-Box, a domain that is the binding site for Skp1p (25Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M.G. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Skp1p is required for the degradation of Sic1p, Cln2p, and Clb5p (25Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M.G. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that a complex containing these proteins is required for the degradation of Sic1p and initiation of S-phase (26King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J-M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Here, we define a region on Cdc34p that is necessary and sufficient for its binding Cdc4p and Cdc53p. We report that Cdc4p, Cdc34p, and Cdc53p form a high molecular weight complex and that this association is required for Cdc34p function. We also show that these three proteins are not only present throughout the cell cycle but that Cdc34p is part of a complex during this process. DISCUSSIONOne essential function of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34p is to attach Ub onto the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1p and thus signal Sic1p for proteolysis. The precise mechanism by which Cdc34p transfers Ub onto Sic1p is not known, however, this process is dependent on at least two other proteins, Cdc4p and Cdc53p. In this report we map a Cdc4p- and Cdc53p-binding domain on Cdc34p and show the importance of in vivo interactions between these three proteins, strengthening the hypothesis that Sic1p ubiquitination is mediated by a multi-protein complex.The Association of Cdc34p with Cdc4p and Cdc53p Is Essential for Cdc34p ActivityWe have defined a Cdc4p/Cdc53p-binding domain on Cdc34p (Fig. 7). This region is not found in other Ubc proteins which suggests that these interactions are unique to Cdc34p. However, the efficiency of Cdc4p and Cdc53p binding to a fusion containing Cdc34p residues 1–209 or residues 171–209 is less than that of a fusion containing full-length Cdc34p. Therefore the remainder of the Cdc34p protein may act to stabilize its association with Cdc4p and Cdc53p. Ptak et al. (34Ptak C. Prendergast J.A. Hodgins R. Kay C.M. Chau V. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26539-26545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that this region is required for Cdc34p dimerization in vitro and it is possible that Cdc4p and Cdc53p bind to a Cdc34p dimer in vivo. Absence of this binding region results in loss of Cdc34p activity and cells are prevented from entering S-phase due to failure to degrade the CDK inhibitor Sic1p. Thus the association of Cdc34p with Cdc4p and Cdc53p is essential for Sic1p ubiquitination. What role does Cdc4p and Cdc53p play in Sic1p ubiquitination? Cdc34p residues 1–170 contain the catalytic domain of Cdc34p and its active site cysteine (Fig. 7). This region has been shown to be charged with ubiquitin by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1 (9Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), an event that does not require Cdc4p or Cdc53p association. Therefore Cdc4p and Cdc53p most likely play a role in transferring Ub from Cdc34p onto its substrates either by substrate recognition or by having a Ub-ligase (E3) activity. Ub-ligases (E3s) have been described (7Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 8Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) yet the sequence comparison of these proteins do not resemble either Cdc4p or Cdc53p. Possibly Cdc53p is required to present the substrate to Cdc34p. Cdc53p has been found to associate with Cln2p, a G1 cyclin that is another candidate Cdc34p substrate (22Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Mathias N. Koybayashi R. Wittenberg C. Tyers M. Cell. 1996; 86: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).Cdc4p, Cdc34p, and Cdc53p Are Members of a Multiprotein ComplexGel filtration analysis shows that Cdc4p, Cdc34p, and Cdc53p are not found as monomers in yeast lysate and take part in associations resulting in the formation of high molecular mass complexes. Overlap of the three proteins' distribution suggests that the Cdc4p·Cdc34p·Cdc53p complex is approximately 400 kDa. This size is greater than that predicted for a complex containing one of each protein (218 kDa), that have a predicted molecular mass of 88, 34, and 96 kDa for Cdc4p, Cdc34p, and Cdc53p, respectively. Therefore either these proteins may act as multimers or additional proteins are part of this complex. Skp1p is required for the ubiquitination of Sic1p and has been shown to bind to Cdc4p through a Cdc4p domain called the F-box (25Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M.G. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). However, Skp1p is only 22 kDa and perhaps other such proteins are required for Cdc34p to interact with Cdc4p and Cdc53p. Significant amounts of Cdc4p and Cdc34p co-fractionate in the absence of Cdc53p and together with our data demonstrating the stabilization of Cdc4p when co-overproduced with Cdc34p suggest that these two proteins form a heterodimer. Again, this association, of approximately 200 kDa may occur in the presence of other proteins. Therefore it appears that components of the Cdc4p·Cdc34p·Cdc53p complex may be separated and be redistributed for distinct ubiquitinating activities.The Cdc34p Complex Is Present throughout the Cell CycleFinally we determined whether Cdc34p existed within a complex throughout the cell cycle. Many cell cycle regulators are themselves only present during specific times of the cell cycle. We have shown here that Cdc4p, Cdc34p, and Cdc53p are present throughout the cell cycle and that Cdc34p appears to reside as part of a complex throughout the cell cycle. Potentially, Cdc34p activity may be required throughout the cell cycle and not just at the G1/S transition in spite of the fac"
https://openalex.org/W2165408978,"The mechanisms of ligand binding and receptor activation for G-protein-coupled receptors in the secretin/parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor subfamily are not understood. The PTH1 receptor (PTH1R) signals in response to both PTH and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), whereas the PTH2 receptor (PTH2R) responds only to PTH, not to PTHrP. To locate PTHrP discriminatory domains in the PTH2R, we generated PTH1R/PTH2R chimeras in which the extracellular amino-terminal domains were exchanged. Production of cAMP in response to 1 μm PTHrP or PTH was identical in cells expressing the PTH1R with the PTH2R amino terminus and in cells expressing the PTH2R with the PTH1R amino terminus. The ability of the chimeric receptor with the PTH2R amino terminus to respond fully to PTHrP showed that the body of the PTH2R must contain sites that limit the response to PTHrP. Mutations to PTH1R sequence were therefore made in each of the seven transmembrane domains of the PTH2R. Mutations in transmembrane domains 3 and 7 resulted in receptors able to respond to PTHrP. Thus, residues in more than one domain form a barrier or filter, allowing the receptor to discriminate between different ligands.

The GPCR for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and for parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) binds and signals via adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C in response to both PTH and the structurally very different ligand PTHrP (1Jüppner H.

What are the structural features of the PTH2R required for this effective discrimination? Features of the ligand required for this selective response have been identified. A single modification of Phe23 in hPTHrP-(1–34) to Trp, the residue in PTH (see Fig. 1), allows the ligand to bind to, but not activate, the PTH2R (5Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Jensen G.S. Usdin T.B. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19888-19893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A modification of a residue in the N-terminal region of the ligand (His5) to the residue found at this position in PTH (Ile) allows activation as measured by cAMP production (5Gardella T.J.

These data are consistent with the idea that the C-terminal region of the peptide hormone is important for binding to the receptor and that the N terminus of the ligand is important for receptor activation (7Jüppner H. Schipani E. Bringhurst F.R. McClure I. Keutmann H.T. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Unanswered by these studies are the structural features of the PTH2R that limit the response to PTHrP. The PTH1R and PTH2R share a high percent sequence homology in their seven transmembrane regions (∼70%), with little homology present in the amino-terminal extracellular domain (3Usdin T.B. Gruber C. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15455-15458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), making them well suited for studies to determine the location and nature of selectivity and activation mechanisms. Previous work with chimeric receptors of between species homologues of the PTH1R (7Jüppner H. Schipani E. Bringhurst F.R. McClure I. Keutmann H.T. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.-B.

Waelbrock M. Robberecht P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) has shown that the amino-terminal domain is a major determinant of binding specificity for related ligands. However, studies of chimeric class II receptors for dissimilar ligands such as PTH and secretin (9Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), calcitonin and PTH (10Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) show that selectivity determinants are also located in the body of the receptor. Taken together, these results support a “two-site” model for receptor-ligand interaction in which ligands are able to bind to “site 1,” located in the amino-terminal domain, with varying affinities. Those that bind are also able to interact with “site 2,” located in the body of the receptor, which results in the stabilization of the active conformation of the receptor, G-protein activation, and intracellular signaling (13Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Implicit in this model is the idea that the receptor contains a discrete activation region, perhaps located within a “pocket” formed by the alignment of the seven helical transmembrane domains. In this model, inappropriate ligands are unable to interact with this activation site 2 because access is prevented by a selectivity barrier or filter, imposed by residues in the body of the receptor. We have identified a putative component of such a selectivity filter or barrier near the extracellular side of the second transmembrane domains of the PTH and secretin receptors (9Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This location was of interest since previous work has shown that other residues in TM2, located nearer the intracellular side of the transmembrane domain, are important for PTH1R activation (14Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 132-139PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Fan M.-H. Lee C.W. J. Biol.

The objectives of this study were therefore to see if the PTH2R shared similar activation properties with the PTH1R and to determine which regions of the PTH2R limit the response to PTHrP. The SacI-XbaI fragment from the pcDNA1 clone containing the opossum kidney PTH receptor sequence (kindly provided by Drs. H. Jüppner and G. V. Segre) (1Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.-B. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Richards J. Kolalowski Jr., L.F. Hock J. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Science. 1991; 254: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pBluescript II KS+(Stratagene). The HindIII-NotI fragment of the clone containing the human PTH2R (kindly provided by Dr. T. B. Usdin) (3Usdin T.B. Gruber C. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15455-15458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) was also cloned into pBluescript II KS+. Following mutagenesis, the 1.9-kilobase opossum kidney PTH1R fragment from a partial digest using BamHI and XbaI was subcloned into pcDNA1amp (Invitrogen) for transfection. TheHindIII-NotI fragment containing the mutated PTH2R sequence was also cloned into pcDNA1amp. For the N-terminal domain exchanges, an AccI restriction enzyme site was generated in the PTH1R (9Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); such a site exists already in the PTH2R. After AccI digestion, the N-terminal fragment was excised from the receptor/pBluescript vectors, with this exchange being made where the conserved transmembrane sequence first diverges between the two receptors. We therefore generated two chimeric receptors: one containing the body of the PTH1R and the N terminus of the PTH2R and one containing the body of the PTH2R and the N terminus of the PTH1R. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing through the mutated or spliced regions. Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis was performed using the protocol contained in a site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) usingAflIII-BglII switch selection primers. Mutagenic primers were designed both to introduce the mutation of choice and to either add or remove a restriction site to facilitate identification of the correct mutant clones. Mutated pcDNA1amp constructs (5 μg/T75 flask) were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using the chloroquine/DEAE-dextran method (18Lopata M.A. Clevelend D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Parallel transfections were always carried out with a plasmid encoding the wild-type PTH2R and the wild-type PTH/PTHrP receptor and sometimes with the pcDNA1amp vector alone. Cells were subcultured into 6-well plates 24 h later and assayed for receptor function and expression 72 h post-transfection. Transfection efficiency was monitored by transfecting cells with green fluorescent protein (EGFP,CLONTECH), subcloned into pcDNA3amp (Invitrogen). Monitoring the percent fluorescent HEK293 cells visible 72 h post-transfection with green fluorescent protein showed that the transfection efficiency for a group of plasmids routinely varied from 10 to 25% from one transfection to the next. Transfected HEK293 cells in 6-well plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and various concentrations of bPTH-(1–34) or hPTHrP-(1–34) (Bachem California). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cellular cAMP was extracted with 1.5 ml of 95% ethanol. Cellular cAMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay (19Nissenson R.A. Strewler G.J. Williams R.D. Leung S.C. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5358-5363PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transfected separately with the constructs encoding the PTH1R and PTH2R were challenged with PTH and PTHrP. The structures of the two ligands used in this study, bPTH-(1–34) and hPTHrP-(1–34), are shown in Fig. 1 a with identities indicated. The cAMP responses of cells transfected with constructs encoding the PTH1R or PTH2R to 1 μm PTH or PTHrP are shown in Fig. 1 b. The PTH1R responses to PTH and PTHrP were of similar magnitude, whereas the PTH2R responded only to PTH and showed no detectable response above basal levels of cAMP production to 1 μm PTHrP. The effects of PTH on both receptors were antagonized using two forms of PTH-(7–34): [Tyr34]PTH-(7–34) and [Nle8,18]PTH-(7–34). A 1000–10,000-fold excess of antagonist was required to achieve significant inhibition of signaling by submaximal doses of PTH for both receptors (data not shown). These results are entirely consistent with previous results for this receptor (3Usdin T.B. Gruber C. Bonner T.I. J. Biol.

At present, it is thought that GPCR activation results from an agonist-induced altered conformation of the transmembrane domains of the receptor (13Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The sequence identity in the body of the PTH2R to that of the PTH1R (Fig. 2) is high (70%), suggesting that the two receptors might share a similar activation mechanism. To test this, we subsequently mutated residues in the second transmembrane domain of the PTH2R (Fig. 2). Our purpose in making these mutations was to see to what extent functional similarities exist between the PTH1R and PTH2R. The mutations made were 1) histidine (position 220 in the PTH1R and position 180 in the PTH2R) to arginine and 2) arginine (position 230 in the PTH1R and position 190 in the PTH2R) to glutamate (Fig. 2). Mutation of these residues alters the signaling properties of both the PTH1R and secretin receptor (14Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 132-139PubMed Google Scholar,15Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Fan M.-H. Lee C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, the histidine-to-arginine mutation has been shown to result in a constitutively active human PTH1R (16Schipani E. Kruse K. Jüppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 17Schipani E. Jensen G.S. Pincus J. Nissenson R.A. Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The results obtained were similar in the two receptors: cells transfected with the H180R mutation in the PTH2R showed little responsiveness to PTH (Fig.3 a), but had grossly elevated basal cAMP levels in the absence of hormone, characteristic of a constitutively active receptor (16Schipani E. Kruse K. Jüppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 17Schipani E. Jensen G.S. Pincus J. Nissenson R.A. Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PTH and PTHrP addition had little or no impact on this receptor activity (Fig. 3 a). The R190E mutation, as in the PTH1R (14Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 132-139PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in a poorly signaling receptor: the EC50 for PTH was right-shifted by ∼10–15-fold, and the maximal cAMP response was ∼30% that of the wild-type PTH2R (Fig. 3 b). These results are consistent with the notion that the two receptors share a common activation mechanism.Figure 3a, basal and PTH- and PTHrP-stimulated (both at 1 μm) cAMP levels in cells transfected with pcDNA1amp alone (vector), the wild-type PTH2R, and the H180R and R190E mutant PTH2Rs.

Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The lack of homology between the two N-terminal domains (Fig. 2) suggested that this could be the region entirely responsible for the discrimination between PTH and PTHrP. Having determined that the two receptors shared some functional similarities in terms of activation, we tested the hypothesis that the inability of the PTH2R to respond to PTHrP was due to a greatly reduced affinity of the N-terminal domain of this receptor for PTHrP. We utilized an AccI site, present in the PTH2R, but generated by mutagenesis in the PTH1R (9Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), to exchange the N terminus of the PTH1R with that of the PTH2R (Fig. 2). Our expectation was that the chimeric receptor with the body of the PTH1R and the N terminus of the PTH2R (1(2Nt)R) would not be able to respond to PTHrP. The reciprocal chimera (2(1Nt)R), containing the PTH1R N terminus, should show no discrimination and respond to both ligands. To our surprise, however, both chimeras showed very robust responses to 1 μm PTHrP, identical in magnitude to the PTH responses (Fig. 4 a). The potency of PTH and PTHrP as ligands was different, however, for the different receptors. Shown in Fig. 4 b are the wild-type receptor cAMP dose-response curves for the two ligands. The PTH1R had similar EC50 values for both PTH and PTHrP (0.28 and 0.25 nm, respectively). The PTH2R responded only to PTH (EC50 = 0.9 nm), not to PTHrP. For the chimeras, PTH and PTHrP showed approximately similar potencies for the 2(1Nt)R chimera (EC50 = 1.1 and 1.3 nm, respectively). However (Fig. 4 c), the 1(2Nt)R chimera had a 100-fold higher apparent affinity for PTH (EC50 = 0.05 nm) than for PTHrP (EC50 = 5 nm). This 100-fold lower potency of PTHrP still resulted in a maximal cAMP response at 1 μm PTHrP (Fig. 4 c). Thus, discrimination between PTH and PTHrP did segregate with the N terminus to some extent, although responses to PTH and not PTHrP were visible only within a narrowly defined range of hormone concentration (Fig. 4 c). These results with the amino terminus of the PTH2R showed that the body of the PTH2R must contain sites that restrict receptor activation by PTHrP. In an attempt to obtain structural information about the location of such residues in the body of the receptor, we chose to make mutant PTH2Rs in which nonconserved transmembrane residues were mutated to PTH1R sequence in each of the seven transmembrane domains. Due to the large number of such candidate residues (Fig. 2), we chose to mutate residues located in the upper, more “extracellular” half of each transmembrane domain (Fig. 2). Our reasoning for this, based on our previous work with the secretin receptor and PTH1R, was to test the idea that the activating ligand interacts with sites located in a pocket formed by the transmembrane regions and that there is a discrete number of residues that function as a selectivity filter to screen out inappropriate ligands. We hypothesized that these residues, if they are to function to prohibit entry to the activation regions, are therefore most likely to be located near the extracellular boundary. This strategy, which was rather loosely adhered to (we did not mutate every nonconserved residue in each transmembrane domain, and we did not mutate residues in the extracellular loops) resulted in the following mutations (Fig. 2): TM1 (F156L and A160T), TM2 (T192V and V196I), TM3 (V241T, M242V, and I244L), TM4 (A293V, A295V, V296T, and A297V), TM5 (G327V and L328V), TM6 (V369M, L370P, V371L, V380M, C380A, and L381T), and TM7 (C397Y, L399M, and F400L). These seven mutant PTH2Rs were screened for their ability to respond to 1 μm PTHrP (Fig.5 a) as well as to 1 μm PTH. While all the mutants were able to respond to PTH, only receptors encoding PTH1R sequence in TM3 or TM7 showed significant detectable responses to PTHrP (Fig. 5). The TM6 mutant showed an ∼2-fold elevated basal cAMP level. This elevated basal cAMP level was also found in a mutant receptor in which 3 of the 6 residues mutated in the TM6 construct were mutated (V369M, L370P, and V371L), but not in the mutant receptor containing the remaining three mutations (V380M, C380A, and L381T) (data not shown). For those transmembrane domain mutant receptors showing no response to PTHrP, the maximal responses to PTH were not significantly different from those for the wild-type PTH2R (Fig. 5), and these receptors were not studied further. In an attempt to further define the mutations in TM3 and TM7 responsible for allowing the response to PTHrP, each of the 3 residues in TM3 and TM7 were mutated individually, and the resulting single-site mutants were screened for their ability to respond to PTHrP. In TM3, the I244L mutant receptor responded with as great a response to PTHrP as the TM3 triple-mutant receptor (Fig.6 a). The mutation V241T resulted in a receptor indistinguishable from the wild-type PTH2R (Fig.6 a). The M242V receptor gave only a poor response (2-fold stimulation) to PTH and no response to PTHrP (Fig. 6 a). Possible reasons for the poor response to PTH could be reduced cell-surface expression or altered signaling properties of this receptor. However, the lack of any PTHrP responsiveness for M242V together with the finding that the I244L mutation was sufficient to account for the entire PTHrP response seen with the original TM3 mutant receptor suggest that M242V does not contribute to PTHrP responsiveness observed with the triple-mutant receptor. For the TM7 mutations (Fig. 6 b), the results were different from TM3 in that two sites seemed to contribute to the response to PTHrP: C397Y and F400L (Fig. 6 b). These two mutations appear to function together since the maximal responses of receptors containing either point mutation alone were of smaller magnitude than that of the TM7 mutant receptor containing all three mutations. The third mutation, L399M, behaved as the wild-type PTH2R behaved, with no response to PTHrP evident (Fig. 6 b). Dose-response curves for PTHrP for the individual single-site TM3 mutant revealed an EC50 of 0.5 μm for I244L (Fig. 7) and ∼0.9 μm for the combined mutations in the TM7 mutant receptor. A receptor containing both I244L and the three mutations in TM7 was generated to see if the presence of sites in two transmembrane domains would further improve the ability of PTHrP to activate. Only a small increase in efficacy for PTHrP was seen (Fig. 7). Furthermore, this response to PTHrP was still right-shifted relative to the response of the 1(2Nt)R chimera to PTHrP (Fig. 4 c), suggesting that there are other residues in the body of the PTH2R that function to limit PTHrP responsiveness. Thus, sites in at least two transmembrane domains of the receptor, TM3 and TM7, appear to function to inhibit PTHrP from acting as an agonist. This study shows that the inability of PTHrP to activate the PTH2R can be attributed 1) to components located in the N-terminal domain and 2) to residues located within the body of the receptor. The location of discriminatory components in the N terminus was not addressed in this study. The N-terminal extracellular domain is known to be important for binding affinity and may serve to fine-tune selectivity such as in cases of PTH/PTHrP interspecies differences (7Jüppner H. Schipani E. Bringhurst F.R. McClure I. Keutmann H.T. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). With closely related ligands like secretin and VIP, exchange of the N terminus of the secretin receptor for the VIP receptor results in a change from the responsiveness characteristic of a secretin receptor to that of a VIP receptor (8Vilardaga J.-P. De Neef P. Di Paulo E. Bollen A. Waelbrock M. Robberecht P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that the modification F23W in PTHrP-(1–34) improves binding to the PTH2R (5Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Jensen G.S. Usdin T.B. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19888-19893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The 1(2Nt)R chimera retains an apparent affinity difference between PTH and PTHrP (Fig.2 c), and one might therefore expect F23W to be as potent as PTH for this chimera. It is of interest to note that another putative ligand, active on the PTH2R, but not on the PTH1R, has been reported in hypothalamic extracts (20Usdin T.B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); the PTH2R may not be exposed to PTH under normal conditions, although presumably would be exposed to PTHrP. The N terminus of the PTH2R does not, however, contain all of the determinants of selectivity. Studies of chimeric class II receptors for apparently unrelated ligands such as calcitonin and PTH (10Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Goldring S.R. Jüppner H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) chimeric receptors have shown that determinants of selectivity are also located in the body of the receptor. Examples also exist for related ligands, such as peptide histidine isoleucineamide (a VIP-related peptide), which binds with high affinity to the rat VIP receptor and with low affinity to the human VIP receptor (12Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.-J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This discrimination is determined by 3 amino acids located at the junction between exoloop 1 and TM3. Our results are similar for PTH/PTHrP discrimination by the PTH2R in that mutation of 1 residue in TM3 (I244L) and 2 in or adjacent to TM7 (C397Y and F400L) allowed PTHrP to activate the PTH2R. It is an exciting possibility that the residues we have identified are responsible for discrimination between His and Ile at position 5 in PTHrP and PTH (4Behar V. Pines M. Nakamoto C. Greenberg Z. Bisello A. Stueckle S.M. Bessalle R. Usdin T.B. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2748-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Jensen G.S. Usdin T.B. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19888-19893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and may represent sites of direct receptor-ligand interaction. If these residues constitute a “barrier” to PTHrP or a selectivity filter such as Asn192 for the secretin receptor (9Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), results from this study show that this barrier cannot be absolute. We postulate that such residues represent an energy barrier to possible ligands, which must be overcome if a ligand is to activate the receptor. The energy to overcome this activation barrier comes from the combined interaction of the ligand with site 1 in the N-terminal domain (and perhaps other sites in the extracellular loops) and from site 2 in the body of the receptor. For the PTH1R/PTH2R chimeras, the energy provided by the binding of PTHrP to the N terminus of the PTH1R must be greater than that provided by interaction with the N terminus of the PTH2R; thus, PTHrP is now able to activate the PTH2R with the PTH1R N terminus (Fig. 3 b). The barrier to activation by PTHrP must be greater for the body of the PTH2R than for that of the PTH1R: the PTH2R N terminus provides enough energy from binding PTHrP to overcome this lower barrier in the 1(2Nt)R chimera. By introducing PTH1R sequence in TM3 and TM7, we postulate that we have reduced the size of this barrier enough to allow PTHrP to function. Presumably by introducing the corresponding PTH2R sequence into TM3 and TM7 in the PTH1R, especially into the chimera containing the PTH2R N terminus, we would be able to reduce the ability of PTHrP to activate. The transmembrane domain residues we have identified as being important for allowing PTHrP to function are in TM3 and TM7. Residues in the corresponding transmembrane domains are involved in activation of other GPCRs such as rhodopsin and catecholamine receptors (21Mizobe T. Maze M. Lam V. Suryanarayana S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2387-2389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of ligand binding and GPCR activation are varied, with some dependence seen on the size of the ligand (22Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Small molecules such as catecholamines and photons, for example, are believed to interact with charged residues in a binding pocket formed by the seven transmembrane domains (21Mizobe T. Maze M. Lam V. Suryanarayana S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2387-2389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Ligand interaction in the best studied case, rhodopsin, is thought to result in a movement of the receptor transmembrane domains relative to each other, TM3 and TM6 in particular (23Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This results in G-protein activation (13Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 22Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). For the large peptide hormones in the secretin/PTH subfamily of GPCRs, the mechanisms of receptor activation are not well understood. For example, how protonation of His223 in the human PTH1R (16Schipani E. Kruse K. Jüppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) or His220 in the opposum kidney PTH1R (17Schipani E. Jensen G.S. Pincus J. Nissenson R.A. Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) results in a receptor locked into the active state is unclear. The role of the arginine in TM2 (Fig. 2) is also unclear (14Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 132-139PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Fan M.-H. Lee C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that residues important for PTH1R activation are also important for PTH2R activation (H180R and R190E), and this supports the notion that these receptors share a common activation mechanism. These residues (His and Arg) are probably not sites of direct ligand binding, but may form part of the energy barrier that the activating ligand must overcome. Is there a discrete activation domain in a pocket formed by an alignment of the transmembrane domains, or does the ligand interact with residues on the extracellular face of the receptor? This is an as yet unanswered question for receptors in this subfamily. However, the location of the receptor sites that interact directly with the ligand, although possibly amenable to study using complementation techniques, will probably require identification using more direct biochemical techniques, such as cross-linking, which has shown PTH binding to the juxtamembrane region of the N-terminal domain of the PTH1R (24Zhou A.T. Bessalle R. Bisello A. Nakamoto C. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Chorev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The constitutive activity we report for H180R for the PTH2R was not found in COS-7 cells (17Schipani E. Jensen G.S. Pincus J. Nissenson R.A. Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a finding that may reflect higher levels of receptor expression or perhaps increased transfection efficiency in HEK293 cells. Basal cAMP levels of the TM6 mutants were also somewhat higher than for the wild-type PTH2R (Fig. 5). It is possible that expression of these TM6 mutant receptors was higher and that the higher expression resulted in this increase in basal “constitutive” activity (17Schipani E. Jensen G.S. Pincus J. Nissenson R.A. Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In summary, we have characterized PTH1R/PTH2R chimeras that respond to PTHrP. Our data suggest a two-site model in which a high affinity interaction of the agonist with the receptor's N-terminal domain and interaction with a second site in the body of the receptor are required for receptor activation. We have identified discrete residues in TM3 and TM7 that form part of this second site and that function to allow the PTH2R to discriminate between PTH and PTHrP. In support of this, Gardella and co-workers (25Bergwitz C. Jusseaume S.A. Luck M.D. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28861-28868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) recently reported that I244L confers on the PTH2R the ability to respond to modified forms of PTHrP. In addition, they identified a PTH2R-to-PTH1R mutation in exoloop 2 (Y318I), not targeted in the present study, that is permissive for PTHrP responsiveness. As in the present study, they generated N-terminal chimeric receptors that responded to PTHrP, although the N-terminal chimera with the N terminus of the human PTH1R (25Bergwitz C. Jusseaume S.A. Luck M.D. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28861-28868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) only responded weakly to the modified PTHrP. This difference could be ascribed to differences in sequence of the N-terminal domains (opossumversus human), the different site used by this group for exchange of the N terminus, or the different ligands used in the two studies. These results provide further evidence for a selectivity filter or barrier as a mechanism of general importance for receptors in the secretin/PTH subfamily. The identification of additional residues that limit response to a ligand and the ability of such residues to be transplanted as a functional unit or to be abrogated as well as identification of the receptor activation domains will undoubtedly be of great importance in the development of agonists and antagonists for the treatment of human disease.

Nishioka Y. Kamohara S. Kanai F. Ishii K. Fukui Y. Shibasaki F. Takenawa T. Kido H. Katsunuma N. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7107-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the physiological function of this phosphorylation has remained unknown. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 seems not to be required for the enzymatic activity of PI3K. Instead, tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 has been reported to correlate with the dissociation of PI3K from the activated insulin receptor kinase (41Zhang W. Johnson J.D. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11317-11321Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).We have studied the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 in hematopoietic cells, and report that phosphorylation occurs at least at Tyr-688 in the C-terminal SH2 domain. This event does not detectably affect the catalytic activity of PI3K per se, but causes a change in the binding properties of the SH2 domain. This change is likely to modify the function of PI3K in intact cells.DISCUSSIONTaken together, our findings indicate that PI3K can be phosphorylated at Tyr-688 in the C-terminal SH2 domain of the p85 subunit in Bcr-Abl expressing HL-60 cells, by active Lck in COS cells, by an unidentified receptor-activated protein-tyrosine kinase in T cells, and by both Abl and Lck in vitro. This phosphorylation does not measurably affect the lipid kinase activity of PI3K (at least at physiological stoichiometry), but was found to change the ligand binding properties of the SH2 domain(s). These results are in agreement with previous observations showing that expression of Bcr-Abl in NIH 3T3 cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3K without any significant increase in PI3K products in vivo(40Varticovski L. Daley G.Q. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).The analysis of SH2 domain function in p85 is complicated by the tandem arrangement of the two SH2 domains, resulting in their cooperative binding to many ligands. Our results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of the C-terminal SH2 domain reduced the affinity for some ligands, while the binding of others was unchanged. Two alternative explanations could be envisualized: either tyrosine phosphorylation changed the ligand selection from the classical Tyr(P)-X-X-methionine to something more or less different, or only the C-terminal SH2 domain was inhibited, while the N-terminal SH2 domain remained unchanged. In the latter case, only of those ligands that bind exclusively to the C-terminal SH2 domain or that require simultaneous binding to both domains will bind less strongly. We have previously observed that expression of the HA-tagged p85 proteins in T cells resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of phospho-TCRζ only when both SH2 domains were present in the p85 protein. Such a requirement for two SH2 domains would explain why the TCRζ binds despite not having the optimal Tyr(P)-X-X-methionine (19Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Leichleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar) motif. Apparently, two Tyr(P)-X-X-leucine motifs in tandem in TCRζ can bind the two SH2 domains of p85 simultaneously and thereby increase the affinity to physiologically relevant levels. The binding of PI3K to TCRζ and CD3 subunits (5Jascur T. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14483-14488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Exley M.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19435-19440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as to isolated phosphopeptides derived from these proteins (21Zenner G. Vorherr T. Mustelin T. Burn P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), has been reported. The findings reported in the present paper may explain why p85 binding to these receptor subunits is of low stoichiometry when assessed by co-immunoprecipitation.In the Bcr-Abl expressing cells, p85 was phosphorylated on tyrosine, but also co-immunoprecipitated with several Tyr(P)-containing proteins. While this may seem conflicting, it is clear that only a fraction of p85 is tyrosine phosphorylated, and it is impossible to judge if any of the co-immunoprecipitating protein bound to the phosphorylated minority of p85 molecules or (more likely) to the unphosphorylated majority. The requirement for both SH2 domains for efficient phosphorylation of p85 proteins in Bcr-Abl expressing cells, suggests that both are involved directly or indirectly in association with the protein-tyrosine kinase responsible for this phosphorylation. The simplest model predicts that the p85 SH2 domains bind directly to Bcr-Abl, but dissociate from it upon phosphorylation of the C-terminal SH2 domain. This would explain why the co-immunoprecipitation of Bcr-Abl and PI3K is of very low stoichiometry.We recently reported that the Lck kinase is phosphorylated at Tyr-192 in the EF loop of its SH2 domain in activated T cells, and in COS-1 cells co-transfected with either Syk or Zap (45Couture C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24880-24884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the SH2 domain, or the mutation of Tyr-192 to an acidic residue, caused a strong decline in the affinity of the domain for tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands (47Couture C.

A similar change was reported by Stover and co-workers (65Stover D.R. Furet P. Lydon N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 21: 12481-12487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for the c-Src SH2 domain upon its phosphorylation at Tyr-213 by the platelet-derived growth factor kinase. In this paper, we add a third example to the list of SH2 domains regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, namely the C-terminal SH2 domain of PI3K p85. Interestingly, Tyr-688 resides in the same region of the SH2 domain as Tyr-192 in the Lck SH2 domain. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of SH2 domains from different proteins shows that many, but not all, contain tyrosine residues in the corresponding location in the EF loop (66Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M. Resh M.D. Rios C.B. Silverman L. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1992; 358: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Notably, the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85 does not. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the regulation of SH2 domains by tyrosine phosphorylation is a more general mechanism for the termination of SH2-ligand interactions, perhaps in part explaining their transient nature in intact cells.

Several additional modes of PI3K regulation have been demonstrated, and it is likely that they act in concert to regulate the production of 3-phosphorylated inositol phospholipids in response to a variety of stimuli.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7107-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the physiological function of this phosphorylation has remained unknown. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 seems not to be required for the enzymatic activity of PI3K. Instead, tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 has been reported to correlate with the dissociation of PI3K from the activated insulin receptor kinase (41Zhang W. Johnson J.D. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11317-11321Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have studied the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 in hematopoietic cells, and report that phosphorylation occurs at least at Tyr-688 in the C-terminal SH2 domain. This event does not detectably affect the catalytic activity of PI3K per se, but causes a change in the binding properties of the SH2 domain. This change is likely to modify the function of PI3K in intact cells. DISCUSSIONTaken together, our findings indicate that PI3K can be phosphorylated at Tyr-688 in the C-terminal SH2 domain of the p85 subunit in Bcr-Abl expressing HL-60 cells, by active Lck in COS cells, by an unidentified receptor-activated protein-tyrosine kinase in T cells, and by both Abl and Lck in vitro. This phosphorylation does not measurably affect the lipid kinase activity of PI3K (at least at physiological stoichiometry), but was found to change the ligand binding properties of the SH2 domain(s). These results are in agreement with previous observations showing that expression of Bcr-Abl in NIH 3T3 cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3K without any significant increase in PI3K products in vivo(40Varticovski L. Daley G.Q. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).The analysis of SH2 domain function in p85 is complicated by the tandem arrangement of the two SH2 domains, resulting in their cooperative binding to many ligands. Our results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of the C-terminal SH2 domain reduced the affinity for some ligands, while the binding of others was unchanged. Two alternative explanations could be envisualized: either tyrosine phosphorylation changed the ligand selection from the classical Tyr(P)-X-X-methionine to something more or less different, or only the C-terminal SH2 domain was inhibited, while the N-terminal SH2 domain remained unchanged. In the latter case, only of those ligands that bind exclusively to the C-terminal SH2 domain or that require simultaneous binding to both domains will bind less strongly. We have previously observed that expression of the HA-tagged p85 proteins in T cells resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of phospho-TCRζ only when both SH2 domains were present in the p85 protein. Such a requirement for two SH2 domains would explain why the TCRζ binds despite not having the optimal Tyr(P)-X-X-methionine (19Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Leichleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar) motif. Apparently, two Tyr(P)-X-X-leucine motifs in tandem in TCRζ can bind the two SH2 domains of p85 simultaneously and thereby increase the affinity to physiologically relevant levels.

Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), has been reported. The findings reported in the present paper may explain why p85 binding to these receptor subunits is of low stoichiometry when assessed by co-immunoprecipitation.In the Bcr-Abl expressing cells, p85 was phosphorylated on tyrosine, but also co-immunoprecipitated with several Tyr(P)-containing proteins. While this may seem conflicting, it is clear that only a fraction of p85 is tyrosine phosphorylated, and it is impossible to judge if any of the co-immunoprecipitating protein bound to the phosphorylated minority of p85 molecules or (more likely) to the unphosphorylated majority. The requirement for both SH2 domains for efficient phosphorylation of p85 proteins in Bcr-Abl expressing cells, suggests that both are involved directly or indirectly in association with the protein-tyrosine kinase responsible for this phosphorylation. The simplest model predicts that the p85 SH2 domains bind directly to Bcr-Abl, but dissociate from it upon phosphorylation of the C-terminal SH2 domain. This would explain why the co-immunoprecipitation of Bcr-Abl and PI3K is of very low stoichiometry.We recently reported that the Lck kinase is phosphorylated at Tyr-192 in the EF loop of its SH2 domain in activated T cells, and in COS-1 cells co-transfected with either Syk or Zap (45Couture C.

The phosphorylation of the SH2 domain, or the mutation of Tyr-192 to an acidic residue, caused a strong decline in the affinity of the domain for tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands (47Couture C.

In this paper, we add a third example to the list of SH2 domains regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, namely the C-terminal SH2 domain of PI3K p85. Interestingly, Tyr-688 resides in the same region of the SH2 domain as Tyr-192 in the Lck SH2 domain. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of SH2 domains from different proteins shows that many, but not all, contain tyrosine residues in the corresponding location in the EF loop (66Waksman G.

Nature. 1992; 358: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Notably, the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85 does not. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the regulation of SH2 domains by tyrosine phosphorylation is a more general mechanism for the termination of SH2-ligand interactions, perhaps in part explaining their transient nature in intact cells.

For instance, nitric oxide and related reactive nitrogen species have antiviral properties, most frequently shown for DNA viruses but also, in vivo, for the RNA Coxsackie B3 virus and the Friend leukemia murine retrovirus (5Akarid K.

Invest. 1996; 97: 1837-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). At a molecular level, the antiviral mechanisms of nitrogen oxides are only partially understood. Viral DNA synthesis requires efficient deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. It has been proposed that inhibition of viral ribonucleotide reductase might partially explain the inhibition of DNA virus replication (6Croen K.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2446-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 7Karupiah G. Xie Q.-W. Buller M.L. Nathan C. Duarte C. MacMicking J.D. Science. 1993; 261: 1445-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). This mechanism might also be relevant to retroviruses, as reverse transcriptase and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors synergize against HIV infection (9Lori F. Malykh A. Cara A. Sun D. Weinstein J.N. Lisziewicz J. Gallo R.C. Science. 1994; 266: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). NO can also affect the viral life cycle by altering intracellular signals required for viral replication, including transcription factors. The transcription factor Zta, which mediates the switch from latent to lytic infection in Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells, is down-regulated by NO (10Mannick J.B. Asano K. Izumi K. Kieff E. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). TwoC- nitroso compounds have also been shown to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity by ejecting zinc from a zinc finger transcription factor (11Rice W.G. Schaeffer C.A. Harten B. Villinger F. South T.L. Summers M.F. Henderson L.E. Bess J.W. Arthur L.O. McDougal J.S. Orloff S.L. Mendeleyer J. Kun E. Nature. 1993; 361: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The importance of NO production in HIV-1 infection has been already established. It has been proposed that activation of neuronal NOS 1 activity by the gp120 envelope protein might explain the neurotoxicity of the virus (12Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Uhl G.R. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3256-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that gp120 and gp41 protein determinants can induce NOS 2 activity in human glial cultures and that retroviral infection induces NOS 2 expression in human monocytes (13Bukrinsky M.I. Nottet H.S.L.M. Schmidtmayerova H. Dubrovsky L. Flanagan C.R. Mullins M.E. Lipton S.A. Gendelman H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 14Koka P. He K.Y. Zack J.A. Kitchen S. Peacock W. Fried I. Tran T. Yashar S.S. Merrill J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These results have suggested a detrimental role for NO in HIV-associated pathology. However, analysis of nitrite serum levels in HIV-1-infected, seronegative children has led to the conclusion that NO might be involved in limiting the infection (15Torre D. Ferrario G. Speranza F. Martegani R. Zeroli C. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1996; 22: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, the onset of functional NOS 2 expression in HIV-infected monocyte cultures was correlated with a sudden drop in reverse transcriptase activity (13Bukrinsky M.I. Nottet H.S.L.M. Schmidtmayerova H. Dubrovsky L. Flanagan C.R. Mullins M.E. Lipton S.A. Gendelman H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), a result that could be interpreted as a negative effect of NO on retroviral replication. The long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence of HIV-1 contains positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements that control the expression of the integrated proviral genome (reviewed in Ref. 16Vaishnav Y.N. Wong-Staal F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 577-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Among these, two NF-κB binding sites constitute the viral enhancer (16Vaishnav Y.N. Wong-Staal F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 577-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 17Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a p65(RelA)/p50 heterodimeric transcription factor belonging to the NF-κB/Rel family, retained inactive in the cytoplasm by association with inhibitory molecules (I-κB) (reviewed in Ref. 18Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of I-κB and, in most cases, subsequent proteolysis enables translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, where its binding to cognate DNA sequences transregulates gene expression. In different models, NF-κB activation has been shown to be inhibited by nitrogen oxides (19Khan B.V. Harrison D.G. Olbrych M.T. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since viral components are able to trigger NO production in host cells, it was of interest to determine whether NO might influence the NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR, either positively or negatively. Bioactive species derived from NOS activities include NO, N2O3, nitrosothiols, dinitrosyl-iron complexes and peroxynitrite, and probably other species as well, each exhibiting a specific reactivity (1Kerwin J.F. Lancaster J.R. Feldman P.L. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4343-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). This complexity cannot be reproduced by using chemical NO precursors, although these molecules have been used extensively in previous studies and have therefore contributed most of our current knowledge about NF-κB modulation by nitrogen oxides. The role of endogenously produced NO has been examined in a few models, involving apparently constitutive NOS 1 or 3 activities (21Peng H.-B. Rajavashisth T.B. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Zeiher A.M. Fisslthaler B. Schrayutz B. Busse R. Circ.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14214-14219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). So far, the effect of NOS 2 products on NF-κB induction in target cells has not been evaluated. In the present work, we used murine EMT-6 cells activated for NOS 2 expression as effector cells capable of producing physiological concentrations of NO-related species over a prolonged period (28Chénais B. Tenu J.-P. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1994; 16: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), to test the hypothesis that NO might modulate HIV-1 LTR activity through NF-κB function. We chose a human lymphoblastoid target cell line transfected with a luciferase reporter gene controlled by the HIV-1 LTR promoter sequence. The JJhan-5.1 clone was derived from the J. Jhan cell line (itself derived from Jurkat cells) stably co-transfected with a LTR-Luc plasmid carrying the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the U3R (BglII-HindIII fragment) of HIV-1 LTR and the pSV2-TK-Neo vector carrying the G418 resistance gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter (29Israël N. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Aillet F. Virelizier J.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3386-3393PubMed Google Scholar). JJhan-5.1 and J. Jhan human lymphoblastoid T cell lines, as well as the EMT-6 murine mammary adenocarcinoma cell line (28Chénais B. Tenu J.-P. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1994; 16: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy-Pontoise, France), supplemented with antibiotics, 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 300 mg/ml l-glutamine, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added in JJhan-5.1 cultures at 400 μg/ml and removed 24 h before experiments. Murine recombinant IFN-γ (specific activity, 1 × 107 units/mg) was provided by Dr. Adolf (Ernst-Boehringer Institut für Arzneimittel Forschung, Vienna, Austria). Human recombinant TNF-α (specific activity, 1.6 × 106 units/mg) was a gift from Dr. Bousseau (Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Vitry-sur-Seine, France). LPS from Salmonella enteritidis, TPA, PHA, andl-NAME were purchased from Sigma. Carboxy-PTIO (2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide) was from France Biochem (Meudon, France). Human 125I-labeled TNF-α (1.2 MBq/μg, 1 μg/ml) was purchased from Life Science Products (Les Ulis, France). Plastic cell culture flasks and dishes were from CML (Nemours, France). GSNO and DETA-NO were purchased from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA) and RBI (Natick, MA), respectively. EMT-6 cells (3 × 106) were seeded in a 75-cm2 culture flask, cultured for 24 h, and stimulated overnight with 40 units/ml murine IFN-γ and 100 ng/ml LPS for NOS 2 induction (28Chénais B. Tenu J.-P. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1994; 16: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When mentioned, l-NAME or aminoguanidine were added at the same time and at a concentration of 2 mm. JJhan-5.1 cells (2 × 107) were co-cultured in 20 ml for up to 4 h with subconfluent EMT-6 cells activated for NOS 2 expression, as described above. Thereafter, non-adherent JJhan-5.1 cells were harvested, centrifuged, and adjusted to 4 × 106 cells/ml. The supernatant was subsequently assayed for nitrite content. JJhan-5.1 cells (2 × 106) were exposed in duplicate to 500 units/ml TNF-α or to 0.5 μm TPA and 5 μg/ml PHA, for 4–6 h. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Results are expressed as the percentage shown in Equation1.100×(luc(cells exposed to NO)/luc(control cells))Equation 1 JJhan-5.1 cells co-cultured with EMT-6 cells or exposed to GSNO or DETA-NO for 4 h were harvested and then stimulated with TNF-α for 30 min (2 × 106 cells/well/500 μl). The cells were then collected, rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 3 volumes of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 2 μg/ml antipain (30Perez C. Wietzerbin J. Benech P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2182-2192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were frozen in liquid N2 and then thawed and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant, consisting of whole cell extract, was used for EMSA. Binding reactions were prepared in 10 μl by mixing 10 μg of protein extract with 2 μl of binding buffer containing 20% Ficoll, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA (30Perez C. Wietzerbin J. Benech P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2182-2192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, 10,000 cpm of32P-radiolabeled (Klenow fragment, Appligene) double-stranded oligonucleotide was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. Samples were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and run at 10 V/cm for 2 h in 0.5 × TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to Fuji XR films at −70 °C. The sequence of the κB oligonucleotide, corresponding to a HIV-1 site, was as follows.5′CTAGACGGGGATTTCCGAGAGGTTGCCCCTAAAGGCTCTCCAGATC5′OLIGONUCLEOTIDEE K B Specific binding was checked by competition with a 100-fold excess of the same unlabeled oligonucleotide added to the binding assay before the 32P-labeled probe. Supershift experiments were done as described above, except that 1 μg of an antibody against the N-terminal region of p65(RelA) or p50 or against the C-terminal region of c-Rel (all from Santa-Cruz, 109-X, 114-X, and 071-X, respectively) was added to the binding mixture 10 min before addition of the radiolabeled probe. The assay was performed following the method of Baglioni et al. (31Baglioni C. McCandless S. Tavernier J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13395-13397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). J. Jhan cells were co-cultured for 4 h with activated EMT-6 cells, as described above. They were adjusted to 20 × 106 cells/ml and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C in 100 μl of culture medium containing 0.1–5 nm human 125I-labeled TNF-α. Another set of similar samples was incubated with a 40-fold excess of cold TNF-α to determine the nonspecific binding. The incubation mixture was then transferred over 400 μl of a silicon oil phase (Rhodorsil, Rhône Poulenc Rorer) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The cell pellet was carefully collected and lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100. Radioactivity in the lysate and in the aqueous phase was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Calculation of the TNF binding dissociation constant (Kd) and the number of binding sites was done using Multifit 2.0 software (Day Computing, Cambridge, UK). Nitrite concentrations in cell culture supernatants were measured with the Griess reagent, as described previously (32Lepoivre M. Flaman J.-M. Henry Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22994-23000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The viability of JJhan-5.1 cells exposed to stimulated EMT-6 cells for 4 h was assayed, using the trypan blue exclusion test. JJhan-5.1 cells that have been stably transfected with an HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase reporter gene express constitutive luciferase activity at a low level, and this activity is considerably enhanced by NF-κB activators such as TNF-α. To explore a possible effect of nitrogen oxides on HIV-1 LTR activation, JJhan-5.1 cells were exposed to NO produced enzymatically by a cellular NOS 2 activity. EMT-6 cells, stimulated for NOS 2 expression by IFN-γ and LPS (here referred to asstimulated EMT-6 cells), were found to be a convenient source of NO since, unlike macrophages, they do not release TNF-α when stimulated with LPS (not shown). Since inhibitors of NF-κB activation such as antioxidants are more active when added as a pretreatment, JJhan-5.1 cells were first co-cultured with EMT-6 cells and then cultured alone for luciferase expression. These sequential incubations also prevented artifactual effects of nitrogen oxides on luciferase expression and activity. Control experiments undertaken at the beginning of this work had shown that JJhan-5.1 cell viability was not altered by co-culture with EMT-6 cells. In particular, protein synthesis in the T cell line was not significantly affected by prior co-culture with EMT-6 cells. Incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was 99.7 ± 4.8 and 96.9 ± 16.3% in JJhan-5.1 cells previously incubated for 4 h with unstimulated or stimulated EMT-6 cells, respectively, as compared with JJhan-5.1 cells cultured alone (mean ± S.E., n = 4). In the absence of NOS 2 induction, the constitutive and TNF-induced luciferase activities were not significantly modified when JJhan-5.1 cells were co-cultured for 4 h with EMT-6 cells (TableI). The low constitutive luciferase activity of JJhan-5.1 cells was also unchanged upon co-culture with stimulated EMT-6 cells. In these experiments, nitrite production, taken as an index of NOS 2 activity in EMT-6 cells, was as high as in macrophage cultures, ranging from 2 to 4 μm per h. Therefore, in this model, a sustained release of nitrogen oxides by NOS 2 activity did not modify the basal activity of the LTR promoter.Table IInhibition of TNF-induced luciferase expression by EMT-6 cells expressing NOS 2 activityCulture conditions1-aJJhan-5.1 cells were cultured in medium alone or co-cultured with EMT-6 cells that have been previously stimulated, or not, for NOS 2 expression.

Open table in a new tab In contrast, the TNF-induced NF-κB activation of the LTR promoter in JJhan-5.1 cells was inhibited 73% by stimulated EMT-6 cells (Table I). The inhibition increased with time, reaching 0, 23, 78, and 90% when JJhan 5.1 cells were cultured with stimulated EMT-6 cells for 1, 2, 4, and 6 h, respectively (mean of triplicates in one experiment, S.D. <5%). Two NOS inhibitors prevented this inhibition. The best protection against stimulated EMT-6 cells was achieved with aminoguanidine, which inhibited nitrite production more efficiently than l-NAME (Table I). Inhibitors alone had no effect on luciferase expression. A nitric oxide scavenger, carboxy-PTIO, also prevented the decrease in luciferase level (data not shown). Compilation of different experiments revealed a strong correlation between NOS 2 activity, measured as nitrite release, and inhibition of TNF-dependent luciferase induction in JJhan-5.1 target cells (Fig. 1). EMT-6 cells culture supernatants were not inhibitory (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that physiologic concentrations of NO (or a related nitrogen oxide) impaired the induction of a LTR-controlled luciferase reporter gene in response to TNF-α. TNF-α binding to JJhan-5.1 cells was not modified after incubation with EMT-6 cells. The receptor affinity (Kd = 1.39 ± 0.28 and 1.35 ± 0.35 nm) and the number of sites per cell (972 ± 111 and 990 ± 110) were similar in JJhan-5.1 cells previously cultured alone or with stimulated EMT-6 cells, respectively (mean ± S.E., n = 2). Thus, the decrease in inducible luciferase expression mediated by stimulated EMT-6 cells did not result from a defect in TNF-α binding to JJhan-5.1 cells. Like TNF-α, an association of 0.5 μm TPA and 5 μg/ml PHA induces luciferase expression in JJhan-5.1 cells. When these cells were co-cultured with EMT-6 cells stimulated for NO production, subsequent stimulation with TPA and PHA was strongly inhibited, resulting in luciferase expression of 20.9 ± 5.9%, as compared with JJhan-5.1 cells alone. The presence of 2 mm l-NAME partially prevented this inhibition (percent luciferase = 49.8 ± 7.04; mean ± S.E., n = 4; p < 0.01 compared with cells without inhibitor). These results suggested that NO inhibited a common step in the signaling pathways triggered by TNF-α and TPA/PHA, leading to HIV-1 LTR activation. Since the activity of the viral promoter is dependent on NF-κB activation, whether it is induced by TNF-α or by TPA/PHA, it was postulated that NO might inhibit the LTR-driven luciferase expression via the inhibition of NF-κB activation. To address this question, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with whole cell extracts from JJhan-5.1 cells. As described previously for the J.Jhan parental clone (29Israël N. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Aillet F. Virelizier J.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3386-3393PubMed Google Scholar), stimulation with TNF-α induced in JJhan-5.1 cells a DNA binding activity toward a κB oligonucleotide sequence (Fig. 2). Supershift experiments with antibodies against p50, p65(RelA), and c-Rel subunits of NF-κB confirmed the predominance of p50/p65(RelA) dimer in the κB binding proteins (not shown). Co-culture of JJhan-5.1 cells for 4 h with stimulated EMT-6 cells followed by the addition of TNF-α strongly inhibited the appearance of the NF-κB binding activity (Fig. 2). Unstimulated EMT-6 cells, which did not express NOS 2 activity, did not modify the response of JJhan-5.1 cells to TNF-α. The NOS 2 inhibitors aminoguanidine andl-NAME prevented the effect of stimulated EMT-6 cells on NF-κB activation. Their efficacy (aminoguanidine ≫l-NAME) was directly related to their ability to inhibit nitrite synthesis by EMT-6 cells (Fig. 2). It was therefore concluded from these experiments that NO-related species released by EMT-6 cells inhibited NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α and also by TPA/PHA, thereby inhibiting the TNF-induced LTR transactivation. In an attempt to characterize the NO-derived species involved in inhibition of NF-κB activation, we investigated the effects of two different chemical precursors of nitrogen oxides, GSNO and DETA-NO. DETA-NO releases mostly the radical ⋅NO molecule and exhibits a long half-life (t½ = 20 h at 37 °C) that minimizes the formation of autoxidation products like N2O3 (33Mooradian D.L. Hutsell T.C. Keefer L.K. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 25: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). GSNO is anS-nitrosothiol, and as such can be considered as a precursor of NO+, NO, and even NO−-like species, depending on its redox environment. As shown in Fig.3, GSNO strongly inhibited the activation of NF-κB in JJhan-5.1 cells stimulated with TNF-α. Maximal inhibition occurred between 94 and 187 μm, corresponding to 13 and 32 μm nitrite produced in the medium. On the basis of nitrite production, taken as a rough estimate of total nitrogen oxide output, GSNO was as effective as EMT-6 cells (compare Fig. 2, lane 3, with Fig. 3, lane 4). In contrast, DETA-NO was a very weak inhibitor of NF-κB activation, even at a concentration of 2 mm (Fig.4). Since the low pH of the Griess assay accelerated DETA-NO breakdown, measurement of nitrite production was not possible here. Yet the amount of total NO released was estimated from the half-life of DETA-NO, after we had checked that the presence of JJhan-5.1 cells had not modified the value previously reported (not shown).

The drug induced a 90% decrease in the steady-state level of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor at the plasma membrane without affecting the rate of internalization, indicating that the return of receptor from endosomes to the plasma membrane is retarded. Wortmannin also slowed the movement of receptor from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network by about 60%. Such a kinetic block would dramatically reduce the number of Man-6-P/IGF-II receptors in the trans-Golgi network, which could account for the previously described hypersecretion of procathepsin D induced by wortmannin. In addition, the drug slowed delivery of endocytosed β-glucuronidase from endosomes to dense lysosomes. These data, taken together with the published reports of others, indicate that wortmannin inhibits membrane trafficking out of multiple compartments of the endosomal system and suggest a role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in regulating these processes.

Biochem. 1986; 55: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In thetrans-Golgi network (TGN), the receptor binds acid hydrolases and the complex is packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles. After budding from the TGN, the vesicles deliver their contents to early endosomes, and perhaps later endosomal compartments as well (5Ludwig T. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,6Rijnboutt S. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15665-15672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the receptor with its bound ligand arrives in the late endosome, the acidic pH in the lumen of this compartment promotes ligand release. The free receptor recycles to the TGN to mediate another round of sorting, and the ligand travels to dense lysosomes (7Brown W.J. Goodhouse J. Farquhar M.G. J.

Cell surface Man-6-P/IGF-II receptors bind IGF-II in addition to extracellular acid hydrolases and are internalized via clathrin-coated vesicles. The endocytic and biosynthetic routes converge at the early endosome, and both pools of receptors mix freely (11Braulke T. Gartung C. Hasilik A. von Figura K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Duncan J.R. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 13Jin M. Sahagian Jr., G.G. Snider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7675-7680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At steady state, the majority of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor is localized to endosomes with small amounts in the TGN and at the cell surface (8Geuze H.J. Stoorvogel W. Strous G.J. Slot J.W. Bleekemolen J.E. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2491-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S.

The source of the cell surface receptor is not fully understood, but the majority may be transported from late endosomes (15Riederer M.A. Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Lin J. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). While the role of clathrin-coated vesicles in the transport of the receptor from the TGN and the plasma membrane to endosomal compartments is well established, the nature of the vesicular carriers that mediate subsequent steps of receptor trafficking is unknown. Recently, several reports have documented that wortmannin, a fungal metabolite known to inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases), induces the hypersecretion of the acid hydrolase procathepsin D (16Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 17Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Two hypotheses have been suggested to explain this defect in lysosomal enzyme sorting. One proposes that a wortmannin-sensitive enzyme is required at the TGN either for the incorporation of Man-6-P/IGF-II receptors into clathrin-coated vesicles or the formation of these vesicles (16Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 17Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The second hypothesis suggests that such an enzyme is required for recycling of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor from late endosomes to the TGN and depletion of receptors from the TGN results in procathepsin D secretion (18Reaves B.J. Bright N.A. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 749-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear from the initial studies that wortmannin produced an altered cellular morphology, namely the appearance of swollen late endosomes containing Man-6-P/IGF-II receptors. This was associated with a loss of receptors from the TGN and the cell surface (16Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 18Reaves B.J. Bright N.A. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 749-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that wortmannin alters the trafficking of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor and suggests a role for PI 3-kinases in this process. However, since these studies primarily utilized morphologic techniques to evaluate receptor distribution, it was not possible to assess the effect of wortmannin on the actual kinetics of receptor transport between compartments. Furthermore, recent work has reported that this altered endosomal morphology does not reflect a block in receptor transport to the TGN (19Nakajima Y. Pfeffer S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To address this issue directly, we have analyzed the effect of wortmannin on the trafficking of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor using a variety of kinetic assays in living cells. In addition, we have analyzed the effect of this fungal metabolite on the transport of β-glucuronidase from the cell surface to dense lysosomes. The results of these experiments indicate that wortmannin retards the movement of both the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor and β-glucuronidase out of late endosomes. All reagents were of analytical grade. Na125I was obtained from Amersham Corp.; UDP-[6-3H]galactose was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO); lactoperoxidase was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); Percoll was from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden); galactosyltransferase was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). All other enzymes and chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Wortmannin was prepared as a 2 mm stock in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. Aliquots were thawed only once, diluted, and used immediately. Mouse L cells stably expressing the bovine Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor (Cc2 cells) or Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor with a truncated cytoplasmic tail (344 cells) have been described previously (20Jadot M. Canfield W.M. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11069-11077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lobel P. Fujimoto K. Ye R.D. Griffiths G. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1989; 57: 787-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The mutant receptor expressed by 344 cells has an Ala substitution at Tyr24, and the cytoplasmic tail is truncated to 29 amino acids. Cell lines were grown in complete medium (α-minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) with 350 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Normal rat kidney cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in complete medium. β-Glucuronidase was purified from the secretions of 13.2.1 cells (a gift from Dr. W. Sly, St. Louis University) as described previously (20Jadot M. Canfield W.M. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11069-11077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cc2 cells were seeded in 22-mm wells of a 12-well tissue culture plate and grown to confluence, washed with PBS, and incubated with 10 nmβ-glucuronidase in complete medium in the absence or presence of 1 μm wortmannin for appropriate times. Medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with PBS five times, washed with 15 mm phosphate-citrate buffer (pH 5.0) twice, and lysed with PBS+1% Triton X-100. An aliquot of the lysate was assayed for β-glucuronidase activity. β-Glucuronidase (30 μg) was iodinated with 1 mCi of Na125I using soluble lactoperoxidase as described (22Tait J.F. Weinman S.A. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11086-11092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and gel-filtered (20Jadot M. Canfield W.M. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11069-11077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of the pooled β-glucuronidase was 8–16 μCi/μg, assuming complete recovery of the β-glucuronidase. The short internalization assay was performed as described previously (20Jadot M. Canfield W.M. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11069-11077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described below. Briefly, 344 or Cc2 cells were seeded into 22-mm wells of a 12-well plate and grown to confluence. When determining the internalization rate in the presence of wortmannin, the cells were pretreated with complete medium containing 1 μm wortmannin for 30 min. The cells were rinsed with complete medium, and then 1 ml of complete medium containing 0.1 μg (approximately 1 × 106 cpm) of125I-β-glucuronidase in the absence or presence of 1 μm wortmannin was added. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the cells were rapidly washed five times with ice-cold PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and the plate was transferred to a 37 °C water bath. A 0.5-ml portion of a mixture of 0.035% trypsin, 0.013% EDTA, 10 mm Man-6-P in 15 mmphosphate-citrate saline, pH 5, was immediately added to each of two wells that were used for measurement of the total surface binding of ligand, while the other wells received an addition of 0.5 ml of 37 °C complete medium containing 1 μm wortmannin when appropriate. After the incubation period, the medium was collected and 0.5 ml of the pH 5 trypsin/Man-6-P mixture was added to each well. At the end of an additional 3-min incubation at 37 °C, 0.8 ml of complete medium was added to each well. The cells were then harvested, pelleted, and the supernatant aspirated. The radioactivity in the cell pellet was measured in a γ-counter. The cells from the two wells used to determine the total surface binding were treated similarly except that the radioactivity of the harvesting medium was measured directly, prior to pelleting the cells. Cc2 cells were seeded in a 24-well tissue culture plate and grown to confluence. Cells were washed with complete medium and then incubated with 0.5 ml of complete medium containing 1 μm wortmannin for up to 3 h. The wortmannin-containing medium was replaced hourly. Cells were then subjected to the same procedure described for determining total surface binding in the rapid internalization assay. Percoll gradient fractionation was performed as described previously (23Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described below. Briefly, confluent cultures of normal rat kidney cells in 100-mm Petri dishes were preincubated or not with 1 μm wortmannin and then incubated with 3 ml of complete medium containing 2 × 106 cpm of125I-β-glucuronidase in the absence or presence of 1 μm wortmannin at 37 °C for an additional 15 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 10 ml of complete medium for up to 90 min in the absence or presence of 1 μm wortmannin. The wortmannin-containing medium was replaced hourly. After two washes with PBS, cells were scraped into 2 ml of homogenization buffer (HB) (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and pelleted for 10 min at 140 ×g at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in 850 μl of HB, and passed 12 times through a ball bearing homogenizer (24Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) with a clearance of 51.2 μm. The homogenate was diluted to 1.7 ml and centrifuged, and the resulting postnuclear supernatant was layered over a discontinuous gradient consisting of a 1.2-ml cushion of 10 × HB and 8.5 ml of an 18% Percoll solution in 1 × HB. The gradient was centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 rpm in a Ti 50 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 4 °C. The gradient was collected from the bottom of the tube in 1-ml fractions. The amount of radioactivity in each fraction was measured in a γ-counter, and an aliquot of each fraction was assayed for β-hexosaminidase activity after the sample was adjusted to 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 1 h. β-Glucuronidase activity was determined by dilution of the samples in 100 mm 4-methlyumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8. The samples were incubated for 15–60 min at 37 °C; the reaction was stopped with the addition of 0.25 m glycine, pH 10.5, and the fluorescence was measured. β-Hexosaminidase activity was determined by dilution of the sample in 5 mm p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide, 50 mm citrate, pH 4.5. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C; the reaction was stopped with 0.2 m sodium carbonate, and the absorbance read at 400 nm. The assay was performed as described previously (12Duncan J.R. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) with a few modifications (25Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse L cells were incubated in complete medium containing 0.02 unit/ml Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase and 0.02 unit/ml Diplococcus pneumoniaeβ-galactosidase for 1 h at 37 °C. The glycosidases were removed by washing cells three times with PBS, and 10 μm 2,3-dehydro-2-desoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid was added to all subsequent incubations to abolish the activity of any neuraminidase that may have been internalized by pinocytosis. Cells were incubated for 30 min with 20 μCi/ml UDP-[6-3H]galactose and 0.2 unit/ml galactosyltransferase on ice to label surface glycoproteins, washed, and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the absence or presence of 1 μmwortmannin. The wortmannin-containing medium was changed after the first hour. The cells were collected by scraping, washed with PBS, and sonicated in lysis buffer (50 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, chymostatin, and antipain, and 10 trypsin inhibitory units/ml of aprotinin), followed by centrifugation at 50,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the solubilized Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor was applied to a phosphopentamannose-Sepharose affinity column. The column was washed with G-25 buffer (50 mm imidazole, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors) and the bound Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor was eluted with G-25 buffer containing 10 mm Man-6-P. The Man-6-P eluted fractions were pooled and digested for 24 h at 37 °C with 0.02 unit/ml D. pneumoniae β-galactosidase. This material was applied to a Sephadex G-25 column, and the radioactivity in the void volume (Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor) and in the included peak (free [3H]galactose) was determined. The percent sialylation of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor was calculated by dividing the radioactivity recovered in the void volume by the sum of the radioactivity in the void and included fractions, and multiplying by 100. As the first step toward investigating the effects of wortmannin on the trafficking of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor, we measured the endocytosis of the acid hydrolase β-glucuronidase by mouse L cells in the presence of this fungal metabolite. The uptake of this enzyme is known to be mediated by the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor (26Kyle J.W. Nolan C.M. Oshima A. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16230-16235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Natowicz M. Baenziger J.U. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4412-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse L cells stably expressing the bovine Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor (Cc2 cells) were incubated with β-glucuronidase for 1 h in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of wortmannin (10 nm to 10 μm). As shown in Fig.1, inhibition of β-glucuronidase uptake was detected at a wortmannin concentration of 10 nm and half-maximal inhibition occurred at 40 nm. The maximal inhibition was 91%. The time course of the wortmannin effect is shown in Fig.2. When β-glucuronidase and 1 μm wortmannin were added to the medium simultaneously, the uptake of the β-glucuronidase decreased progressively for the first hour (relative to the control cells) and then gradually increased during the next 2 h of incubation. If the cells were pretreated with wortmannin for 15 min prior to the addition of the ligand, the inhibition of β-glucuronidase uptake was more pronounced during the first hour. Furthermore, in the latter experiment additional wortmannin was added at hourly intervals and the uptake of β-glucuronidase remained at the minimal level during the 3-h incubation. The fact that inhibition was maintained when wortmannin was added at regular intervals suggested that the drug was being inactivated during the course of the 3-h experiment. To test this possibility directly, cells were incubated with β-glucuronidase for 3 h and wortmannin was added one to four times during the incubation, such that the final concentration added was 1 μm in all cases. The results summarized in Fig. 3 confirm that repeated additions of wortmannin are required to maintain the maximal inhibiting effects and support the conclusion that the wortmannin is being inactivated over time. Therefore, all subsequent experiments were performed in the presence of 1 μm wortmannin and the wortmannin-containing medium was replaced hourly.Figure 3Wortmannin inhibition of Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor-mediated endocytosis diminishes with time. Mouse L cells stably expressing the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor were incubated with β-glucuronidase for 3 h. Equal aliquots of wortmannin were added simultaneously with ligand and during equal intervals over the 3-h incubation such that the final concentration in the 1-ml well equaled 1 μm. One addition indicates that 1 nmol of wortmannin was added at time 0. Two additions indicates that 500 pmol of wortmannin was added at time 0 and 90 min. Three additions indicates that 333 pmol of wortmannin was added at time 0, 60, and 120 min. Four additions indicates that 250 pmol of wortmannin was added at time 0, 45, 90, and 135 min. The amount of internalized β-glucuronidase was determined and expressed as a percentage of that internalized by control cells in the absence of wortmannin. The data represent the mean of two independent experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The inhibition of β-glucuronidase uptake in the presence of wortmannin could be due to a loss of cell surface receptors or a decrease in their rate of internalization. To determine if the number of cell surface Man-6-P/IGF-II receptors was diminished, Cc2 cells were treated with 1 μm wortmannin for up to 3 h at 37 °C and then the surface binding of125I-β-glucuronidase was measured on ice. As shown in Fig. 4, wortmannin caused a rapid decline in the amount of 125I-β-glucuronidase that bound to the cell surface receptors. The maximal decrease of 90% was reached with a t½ of approximately 15 min. Similar results were obtained when the wortmannin-treated cells were rinsed with 5 mm Man-6-P prior to measuring125I-β-glucuronidase binding or when the concentration of β-glucuronidase was increased 30-fold. This indicates that the decline in 125I-β-glucuronidase binding was not due to occupancy of the receptor by endogenous ligand or to a decrease in the affinity of the receptor for its ligand, but rather to a reduction in the number of cell surface receptors. The effect of wortmannin on the initial rate of receptor internalization was determined as follows;125I-β-glucuronidase was allowed to bind on ice to cells that had been pretreated or not for 30 min with 1 μmwortmannin. The unbound ligand was removed, and the cells were warmed to 37 °C. Receptor internalization was followed by determining the rate of uptake of β-glucuronidase over a 2-min period in the absence or presence of wortmannin. This experiment was initially performed with L cells expressing the wild-type receptor, but the binding of125I-β-glucuronidase to the cells preincubated with wortmannin was reduced so much that valid measurements could not be obtained (Fig. 4). To overcome this technical problem, the 344 cells were used because they have more surface receptors than Cc2 cells. The Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor expressed in 344 cells has a truncated (29-amino acid) tail, but it is internalized at the same rate as the wild-type receptor (20Jadot M. Canfield W.M. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11069-11077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the truncated receptor is lost from the cell surface of wortmannin-treated 344 cells with kinetics identical to those described for the full-length receptor in the Cc2 cell line (data not shown). Fig. 5 shows that the presence of 1 μm wortmannin had no effect on the initial rate of β-glucuronidase internalization. Since wortmannin causes the number of cell surface receptors to decrease without altering the rate of receptor internalization, the return of receptors to the cell surface must be inhibited. One explanation for the defective acid hydrolase sorting induced by wortmannin is that recycling of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor to the TGN is impaired. To measure this step, we took advantage of the fact that the receptor is a glycoprotein that can be acted upon by sialyltransferases localized in the TGN (28Bennett G. O'Shaughnessy D. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Roth J. Taatjes D.J. Weinstein J. Paulson J.C. Greenwell P. Watkins W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14307-14312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Roth J. Taathes D.J. Lucocq J.M. Weinstein J. Paulson J.C. Cell. 1985; 43: 287-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Consequently, the actions of these glycosyltransferases can be used to mark the return of receptor molecules to the Golgi. However, the Asn-linked oligosaccharides on the receptor must express a terminal galactose to be substrates for the sialyltransferases. Therefore, we pretreated mouse L cells with neuraminidase and β-galactosidase to remove the sialic acid and galactose residues of the cellular glycoproteins. The resulting terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues of the cell surface glycoproteins (including the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor) were labeled with [3H]galactose by incubating the cells with exogenous galactosyltransferase and UDP-[6-3H]galactose on ice. The cells were then warmed to 37 °C in the absence or presence of wortmannin for 2 h to allow the surface-labeled receptor molecules to be internalized and return to the TGN, where sialic acid residues are transferred on to the [3H]galactose by sialyltransferase. To determine the rate of sialylation, the receptor was isolated on a phosphopentamannose-Sepharose affinity column and treated with β-galactosidase, which releases terminal [3H]galactose residues, but not [3H]galactose residues that have been modified through the addition of sialic acid moieties. The released [3H]galactose was then separated from the receptor by gel filtration. The fraction of the [3H]galactose that is resistant to β-galactosidase reflects the rate of return of receptor molecules to the Golgi and the efficiency of their sialylation. The results of two typical experiments performed in duplicate are shown in Table I. In each experiment, a background value of [3H]galactose that was not cleaved during the β-galactosidase treatment was determined by digesting receptor recovered from labeled cells that had not been warmed to 37 °C. After 2 h at 37 °C, receptor from the control cells was sialylated an average of 8.5% over the background compared with an average of 3.5% in the case of the receptor from wortmannin-treated cells. Overall, the sialylation of receptors isolated from wortmannin-treated cells was reduced by about 60%. This type of resialylation experiment was also performed with BW 5147 PHAR1.8 mouse lymphoma cells with similar results (data not shown). These data indicate that wortmannin slows the return of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor to the TGN.Table IWortmannin inhibits sialylation of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptorTotal cpmβ-galactosidase-resistant countsAverage sialylation (above background)%%Experiment 11-aIn this experiment, some of the wortmannin-treated cells were lost accounting for the decrease in total radioactivity recovered relative to the untreated cells.

Open table in a new tab After the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor with its bound ligand is internalized at the plasma membrane, the complex is transported through early endosomes to a late endosomal compartment, where the acidic pH promotes the release of the ligand, which is subsequently delivered to the dense lysosome. The studies described in the previous section show that wortmannin does not affect the initial rate of internalization of β-glucuronidase, which is mediated by the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor. To determine if this fungal metabolite influences the later steps in this pathway, we followed the delivery of125I-β-glucuronidase to dense lysosomes in the presence and absence of this agent. Control and wortmannin pretreated normal rat kidney cells were allowed to take up 125I-β-glucuronidase for 15 min. Following chase times of up to 90 min, the cells were homogenized and the postnuclear supernatants were fractionated on 18% Percoll gradients to separate dense lysosomes from other membranous compartments (including endosomes) that were recovered near the top of the gradient. Fractions were collected and the radioactivity in each fraction determined, as shown in Fig. 6. To identify the position of dense lysosomes in the gradient, each fraction was assayed for the lysosomal marker β-hexosaminidase. I"

The extracellular S100B activities rely on the oxidation of the protein cysteine residues (Kligman, D., and Marshak, D. R. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 7136–7139; Winningham-Major, F., Staecker, J. L., Barger, S. W., Coats, S., and Van Eldik, L. J. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 3063–3071). Here we show that oxidation of the S100B cysteine residues, Cys-68 and Cys-84, induces a conformational change in the protein structure, unmasking a canonical CKII phosphorylation site located within the typical EF-hand calcium-binding site IIβ. Intrasubunit disulfide-bridged S100B monomer and disulfide-bonded S100B dimer are phosphorylated by the catalytic CKII-α subunit on Ser-62 with a Km of 0.5 μm and a Vmax of 10 pmol/min/100 pmol of S100B. Oxidized S100B is the best in vitro CKII-α substrate identified so far. Next we show that intrasubunit disulfide-bridged S100B monomer is the most potent S100B species to stimulate [3H]thymidine uptake by C6 glial cells in culture. In addition, the phosphorylated intrasubunit disulfide-bridged S100B monomer retains apparent mitogenic activity toward C6 glial cells, and hence, 32P-labeled S100B should be a useful probe for characterizing the mechanisms by which extracellular oxidized S100B functions. Finally, we show that formation of intrasubunit disulfide-bridged S100B monomer is stimulated by peroxynitrite anion, suggesting that production of mitogenic S100B species could be enhanced in neuropathology associated with peroxynitrite anion production. The glial-derived calcium-binding protein S100B can be secreted to act as a neurotrophic factor or a mitogen, stimulating proliferation of glial cells. The extracellular S100B activities rely on the oxidation of the protein cysteine residues (Kligman, D., and Marshak, D. R. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The S100B protein belongs to the family of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. In solution, S100B (Mr = 10,500) forms noncovalent dimers (Mr = 21,000). The S100B protein dimer binds calcium with micromolar affinity (Kd 10–100 μm) and zinc ion with nanomolar affinity (Kd 10–100 nm) (1Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baudier J. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8204-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The S100B affinity for calcium is highly dependent on the quaternary protein structure. Zn2+ binding or alkylation of Cys-β84 destabilizes the S100B quaternary structure to induce an increase in the protein's affinity for calcium (1Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baudier J. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8204-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Baudier J. Glasser N. Duportail G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6934-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The S100B is in highest concentration in the vertebrate nervous system. The gene for human S100B maps to the Down's syndrome region of chromosome 21 (4Allore R. O'Hanlon D. Price R. Neilson K. Willard H.F. Cox D.R. Marks A. Dunn R.J. Science. 1988; 239: 1311-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and increased levels of S100B proteins are found in the brain of individuals with Down's syndrome (5Griffin W.S.T. Stanley L.C. Ling C. White L. MacLeod V. Perrot L.J. White C.L. Araoz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7611-7615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar) and in Alzheimer brains (6Marshak D.R. Pesce S.A. Stanley L.C. Griffin W.S. Neurobiol. Aging. 1991; 13: 1-7Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar), suggesting its potential involvement in common neuropathologies associated with these diseases. In the brain, S100B is synthesized by glial cells, but a secreted form that appears to be an oxidized S100B species has neurotrophic and mitogenic activity (7Kligman D. Marshak D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7136-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 8Selinfreund R.H. Barger S.W. Pledger W.J. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

S100B has been detected in brain extracellular fluid and in conditioned medium from astroglial cells (10Shashoua V.E. Hesse G.M. Moore B.W. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Van Eldik L. Zimmer D.B. Brain Res. 1987; 436: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Oxidized monomeric, homodimeric, and higher oligomeric disulfide-bonded forms of S100B were purified from bovine brain as a protein mixture that had neurite extension activity in chick embryonic cortical neurons (7Kligman D. Marshak D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7136-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The reduced form of S100B has no activity in inducing neurite extension, and similarly, the activities of the recombinant protein was dependent upon the presence of the two cysteine residues β68 and β84 (12Winningham-Major F. Staecker J.L. Barger S.W. Coats S. Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3063-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). S100B is also a glial mitogen, and that activity depends on the presence of Cys-68, suggesting that extracellular mitogenic activity of S100B also relies on the oxidation state of its cysteine residues (8Selinfreund R.H. Barger S.W. Pledger W.J. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3554-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 9Barger S.W. Wolchok S.R. Van Eldik L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1160: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Extracellular S100B stimulates both calcium flux in glial C6 cells (13Barger S.W. Van Eldik L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9689-9694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inducible nitric oxide synthase activity in rat cortical astrocytes (14Hu J. Castets F. Guevara J.L. Van Eldik L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2543-2547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the extracellular form of S100B induces neurite outgrowth and/or cell proliferation is not yet known. Taking into account that in normal brain S100B accumulates in glial cells in a reduced state, an important issue will be to understand the processes and pathways that regulate formation of oxidized S100B forms in vivo and the pathways implicated in S100B secretion. The second question concerns the molecular mechanisms by which extracellular S100B elicits its effects. Is the active S100B species internalized by the target cell or are there cell-surface receptors that transduce the S100B signal? Hopefully these questions could be resolved if the biologically active oxidized S100B is clearly identified and if sufficient amounts of that species could be produced to allow more extensive structural and functional studies. We developed a rapid and large scale method to produce mitogenic oxidized S100B, and we show that conformational changes induced by intrachain or interchain disulfide bridge formation in S100B led to unmasking a canonical CKII phosphorylation site located within the typical EF-hand calcium binding site IIβ. We also show that intrasubunit disulfide-bridged S100B monomer is the most potent S100B mitogenic species toward rat C6 glial cells. Recombinant CKII-α and holoenzyme were prepared as described previously (15Filhol O. Baudier J. Delphin C. Loue-Mackenbach P. Chambaz E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20577-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine brain S100B (ββ), S100A1 (αα), and S100a (αβ) were purified as described previously (1Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baudier J. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8204-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intrachain disulfide-bonded S100B was prepared by the method of Mely and Gérard (16Mely Y. Gerard D. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Covalent disulfide-bonded S100B dimers were prepared by incubation of freshly purified S100B with 5 mmsodium tetrathionate (Sigma) in the presence of 1 mmcalcium at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 mm EGTA, and the protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. After this treatment 80–90% of S100B was disulfide-bonded S100B dimers. Oxidized S100B concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent using purified reduced S100B as standard. 11% polyacrylamide gels were used according to the method described by Schagger and Von Jagow (17Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) for the separation of proteins ranging from 1 to 100 kDa. Peroxynitrite was synthesized in a quenched flow reactor, as described previously (18Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 19Reed J.W. Ho H.H. Jolly W.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 1248-1249Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The concentration of peroxynitrite was determined by absorbance at 302 nm in 1 m NaOH (ε302 nm = 1670 m/cm). Peroxynitrite oxidation of S100B was performed as follow: S100B in 20 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmCaCl2 was first acidified by addition of 10 μl of 1n HCl followed by addition of 10 μl of peroxynitrite in 1n NaOH. S100B was run on a SDS-PAGE, 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; DTT, dithiothreitol; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CaM, calmodulin. and the Coomassie-stained spots were in-gel digested as described previously (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein spots were excised and destained with 30% ethanol. After washing with 50% acetonitrile, gel pieces were dried and reswollen in 20 μl of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.5 μg of endo-Asp-N protease (Boehringer Mannheim, sequencing grade), and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. A 0.4-μl volume of the digest solution was used for mass spectrometric analysis; it was added onto the sample probe to 0.4 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid prepared in 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI mass spectra of peptide mixtures were obtained using a Bruker Biflex mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a SCOUT multiprobe inlet and a gridless delayed extraction source. Ion acceleration voltage was 19.5 kV, and the reflectron voltage was 20.0 kV. For delayed ion extraction, a 6.2-kV potential difference between the probe and the extraction lens was applied. Mass spectra were acquired as the sum of ion signals generated by irradiation of the target with 50–100 laser pulses; they were calibrated externally. Activity (substrate phosphorylation) of CKII-α or CKII-α2β2 was measured in a total assay volume of 60 μl, consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrates and 40 μm[γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by addition of 30 μl of SDS sample buffer. The phosphorylated protein was separated from [32P]ATP by SDS-Tris/Tricine-PAGE (17Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). The amount of 32P incorporated into protein was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Purified intrasubunit disulfide-bonded S100B (100 μg) in standard reaction buffer was phosphorylated by CKII-α (0.5 μg) in the presence of [32P]ATP. The protein was precipitated in 15% trichloroacetic acid, the pellet washed twice with ethanol and acetone, and resuspended by sonication in 200 μl of 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.05% SDS, 10 mm DTT. The protein was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (sequencing grade from Sigma) at 35 °C for 15 h with a 1:100 (protease:S100B) weight ratio. The digested sample was adjusted to 6 m guanidinium chloride plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, incubated with 20 mmiodoacetamide for 15 min, and applied to an Octadecyl (C18), 5 μm, 4.6 × 100 mm high pressure liquid chromatography column. The peptides were separated with a gradient of 5–70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 40 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected. The radioactivity of each fraction was determined by Cerenkov counting. The32P-labeled peptide eluted at 30 min and was subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. Radioactivity of the eluted fractions from each sequencing cycle was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Rat C6 glioma cells were routinely maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Seromed), 20 units of penicillin per ml, and 20 μg of streptomycin per ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). For analysis of S100B mitogenic activity, C6 cells were placed into 35-mm tissue culture wells at a density of 106 cells per dish and allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells were then washed with DMEM and incubated for 36 h in DMEM in the presence of O.O5% serum. Cell continued to grow, and at the time of stimulation they had reached confluency. Confluent cells were stimulated by changing the medium to DMEM containing various concentrations of S100B. After 42 h, [3H]thymidine was added to cells, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined after 2 h. All experiments were done in duplicate and repeated at least two times with different cell batches. Fig. 1, A and B, shows an SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie Blue staining of two different preparations of bovine brain S100B protein stored at −20 °C for several months (lanes 1–3). Bovine brain calmodulin was run on the same gel (lane 2). Under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1 A), S100B migrates mainly as a band with an apparent Mr of 6500 corresponding to the S100B monomer. Additional minor bands are also visible at apparent Mr 22,000 and 33,000 (lanes 1 and 3). These bands react with S100B antibodies by Western blot analysis and correspond to disulfide-bonded S100B dimers and larger oligomers (data not shown). Reduction of the proteins with 50 mm DTT prior to electrophoresis results in a shift of the lower mobility bands to the Mr 6500 band (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the electrophoretic mobility of calmodulin, which has no cysteine residues, was not sensitive to reducing agent (lane 2). CaM is a recognized in vitro and in vivosubstrate for CKII-α subunit (21Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Quadroni M. James P. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16116-16122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1, A and B, also shows a comparison of the phosphorylation of CaM and S100B preparations by CKII-α. The data show that disulfide-bonded S100B dimer and oligomers are much better substrates for CKII-α than CaM and that S100B monomer is only weakly phosphorylated (Fig.1 A). As shown below, the phosphorylated S100B monomer most likely represents S100B with intrachain disulfide bond. As expected, in the presence of DTT, the reduced phosphorylated S100B dimer and higher oligomers migrated at the position of S100B monomer (Fig.1 B). To confirm the specificity of phosphorylation of the disulfide-linked form of S100B by CKII-α, we developed a method for large scale preparation of covalent disulfide-bonded S100B dimers. This was achieved by incubation of freshly purified S100B with the oxidizing agent sodium tetrathionate in the presence of calcium (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3 and 4). No free SH groups remain titratable on the covalent disulfide-bound S100B dimers after denaturation in 6m guanidinium chloride, suggesting that both Cys-β68 and Cys-β84 are involved in the formation of the disulfide-linked form of S100B (not shown, see also below). In the absence of calcium, sodium tetrathionate could not cross-link S100B as a dimer (lanes 5 and 6), and the two cysteine residues remain titratable after denaturation in 6 m guanidinium chloride (not shown). As expected, covalent disulfide-bound S100B dimers become phosphorylated by CKII-α (lanes 3 and 4), whereas the reduced protein is not (lanes 5 and 6). It is noteworthy that incubation of S100B with sodium tetrathionate in the presence of calcium (lanes 3 and 4) also resulted in phosphorylation of a population of S100B migrating as a monomer, suggesting that sodium tetrathionate might also stimulate formation of an intrachain disulfide bond between Cys-84 and Cys-68. Alkylation of the S100B preparation on both Cys-68 and Cys-84 by iodoacetamide after protein denaturation in guanidinium chloride also induced phosphorylation of the alkylated S100B monomer by CKII-α (Fig. 1 C, lane 2), confirming that phosphorylation depends on the oxidation of the S100B sulfhydryl groups. We also compared the effect of sodium tetrathionate on the Ca2+-dependent covalent dimerization and CKII-α phosphorylation of the homodimers S100B (ββ) and S100A1 (αα) and of the heterodimer S100a (αβ) (Fig. 1 D). S100B and S100A1 have a common cysteine residue, Cys-β84 and Cys-α85, which is specifically exposed to solvent in the presence of Ca2+ (3Baudier J. Glasser N. Duportail G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6934-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Only S100B has a second cysteine residue in position β68. Sodium tetrathionate catalyzed disulfide-linked forms of S100B (lane 1) but was much less efficient in catalyzing disulfide-linked forms of S100A1 and S100a (αβ) (lanes 2 and 3), confirming that both Cys-β84 and Cys-β68 are probably implicated in the formation of covalent disulfide-bound S100B dimers. Furthermore, only oxidized S100B (lane 1), and to a lower extent the heterodimer S100a (αβ) (lane 3), is phosphorylated by CKII-α indicating that phosphorylation is specific to the S100-β subunit. A significant amount of the neurite extension factor initially purified from bovine brain was shown to migrate as a monomer on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that intrachain disulfide-bridged S100B monomer could have biological activity (7Kligman D. Marshak D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7136-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Intrasubunit disulfide-bridged monomeric S100B species with a disulfide bond between Cys-68 and Cys-84 could be obtained by incubating the protein under denaturating conditions and gel filtration to separate intrasubunit disulfide-bridged monomeric species from intersubunit disulfide-bridged polymeric species (16Mely Y. Gerard D. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Intrachain disulfide bond between Cys-68 and Cys-84 in the oxidized S100B monomer preparation was confirmed by MALDI mass spectroscopy analysis of the protein after digestion with endo-Asp-N protease (Fig.2). After SDS-PAGE, the reduced and oxidized S100B were digested with endo-Asp-N protease, and the peptide mass maps were compared. Under our experimental conditions, both Asp and Glu residues are potential sites of cleavage by endo-Asp-N. Hence, the major mass peaks did not fit with the masses expected in case digestion would have been restricted to Asp residues. The mass spectroscopy spectrum obtained with the reduced S100B species revealed a series of peaks, called A, with masses of 1553.77, 1571.69, 1587,63, and 1603.66 Da that is absent in the oxidized S100B spectrum. By comparison with peptide masses expected after cleavage at Asp or Glu residues, the 1571.69-Da peak fit with the expected mass of peptide72EFMAFVAMITTACH85. Oxidation of one or two methionine residues within this peptide explains mass peaks at 1587.63 and 1603.66 Da. The mass peak at 1553.77 correspond to a dehydrated form of this peptide. In the mass spectrum of the reduced S100B, the A series of peaks was immediately followed by the A′ series. A′ series have masses that correspond to A series incremented by 71 Da, corresponding to acrylamide adduct on Cys-84 generated during electrophoresis. The mass spectroscopy spectrum obtained with the oxidized S100B species revealed another series of peaks, called B, with two major peptide species having a molecular mass of 2772.27 Da and 2788.47 Da, respectively. That B series of peaks is not present in the reduced S100B spectrum. The mass difference between the B series of peaks in oxidized S100B and the A series of peaks in reduced S100B fits exactly with the mass of peptide61DSDGDGECDFQ71, confirming the presence of an intramolecular disulfide bridge between Cys-68 and Cys-84 in the oxidized S100B. Note that the Asp-61–Gln-71 peptide could not be detected in the reduced S100 peptide mass map, most probably because its highly acidic properties that makes its desorption under a protonated form very unlikely. Note also the absence of cleavage at Asp-61, Asp-63, Glu-67, and Asp-69 in the oxidized S100B, suggesting that disulfide bond stabilizes the peptide conformation, making those acidic residues not accessible to the protease. The intrasubunit disulfide-bridged monomeric S100B species was also found to be an excellent substrate for CKII-α (Fig.3, lane 1, and Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and 2). Incubation of the oxidized S100B monomer with 10 mm DTT prior to incubation with CKII-α results in a total inhibition of phosphorylation (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3), confirming that intracellular disulfide bond directly contributes to S100B phosphorylation. To determine the exact contribution of each individual Cys residue on the phosphorylation of S100B, we compared the phosphorylation of S100B alkylated with the thiol reagent Bimane on Cys-84 or on both Cys-84 and Cys-68. Specific alkylation of Cys-84 with Bimane in the presence of calcium (3Baudier J. Glasser N. Duportail G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6934-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) did not generate phosphorylatable S100B protein (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). Alkylation of the S100B monomer on both Cys-68 and Cys-84 with Bimane after protein denaturation in guanidinium chloride was required for phosphorylation by CKII-α (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), suggesting that oxidation of Cys-68 is essential for optimum phosphorylation of S100B.Figure 4Characterization of the phosphorylation of oxidized S100B monomer by CKII-α.

C, the effect of Ca2+ and Zn2+ on S100B phosphorylation. S100B preparation stored for several months at −20 °C (lane 1) or oxidized S100B with an intrachain disulfide bond between Cys-68 and Cys-84 (lane 2) were phosphorylated by CKII-α in the absence (EGTA) or in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ or 5 μmZn2+ as indicated. A–C, the phosphorylated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE in the absence of DTT. Gel were Coomassie Blue-stained (left panels) and processed for autoradiography (right panels). In the left margins are the positions of molecular weight standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In vitro, calmodulin is not phosphorylated by the CKII holoenzyme α2β2. The recombinant CKII-α subunit, however, spontaneously phosphorylates calmodulin (23Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Marin O. Marchiori F. Perich J.W. Issinger O.G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As observed with calmodulin, the α subunit of CKII was more efficient than the holoenzyme (α2β2) in phosphorylating alkylated S100B or disulfide-bridged monomeric S100B (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3) or disulfide-bridged S100B dimer (not shown). The phosphorylation of monomeric and oligomeric S100B by CKII-α was proven to rely exclusively on changes induced upon oxidation of Cys residues. Neither calcium nor zinc ions, two conformational effectors of the S100B (1Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baudier J. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8204-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could modulate phosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 4 C). The phosphorylation of oxidized monomeric and dimeric S100B by purified CKII-α is a very rapid reaction. With 0.5 μm S100B and 80 nm CKII-α in the assay, the phosphorylation is maximal within 1–2 min (Fig.5 A). With the S100B preparation used in this experiment, the phosphorylation stoichiometry of oxidized monomeric S100B was calculated to be 0.7 mol of phosphate incorporated per mol of S100B monomer (Fig. 5 A). We confirmed these kinetic and stoichiometry procedures with two different oxidized S100B monomer preparations and two different CKII-α preparations. The observed sub-stoichiometric phosphorylation is probably due to overestimation of the oxidized S100B concentration that has been determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent using purified reduced S100B as standard. To our knowledge the oxidized S100B is the best in vitro substrate for CKII-α so far identified with a Km of 0.5 μm and aVmax of 10 pmol/min/100 pmol of S100B (Fig. 5, B and C). As expected, in a competition assay, oxidized monomeric S100B totally abolished CaM phosphorylation by CKII-α at a S100B/CaM molar ratio of 1:10 (Fig. 5 D). Note that in this experiment 2 mm EGTA was included in the phosphorylation buffer. Indeed, it has been shown that Ca2+may inhibit phosphorylation of CaM in vitro (24Meggio F. Brunati A.M. Pinna L. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine the CKII-α-phosphorylated residue on the monomeric and dimeric S100B, the 32P-labeled proteins were digested by trypsin and the resulting phosphopeptides analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.6 A). In the absence of reducing agent, the phosphopeptides obtained from digestion of the monomeric and dimeric 32P-S100B migrate with apparent mass of 3.4 and 6.5 kDa, respectively. In the presence of DTT, the phosphopeptides co-migrate with the same apparent mass of 3.5 kDa. The phosphopeptides were purified by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures” and sequenced. The released radioactivity coincided with the identification of Ser-62, indicating that this residue is the phosphorylated amino acid (Fig. 6 B). Ser-62 is located within the calcium binding loop of site IIβ and corresponds to a canonical CKII phosphorylation site domain (Fig. 6 C) (25Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). We next investigated if a more physiological oxidant than sodium tetrathionate could catalyze the formation of disulfide bridges and CKII-α phosphorylation of S100B. NO as a second messenger reacts readily with other free radicals such as superoxide anion (O·̄2) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−). NO and products of NO oxidation are capable of reaction with thiols to give further products with biological activities (26Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mahoney C.W. Pak J.H. Huang K.-P. J. Biol.

We tested the effect of various NO donors (DEA, SIN-1), O·̄2 precursor (pyrogalol), and peroxynitrite anion (OONO−) on the oxidation of S100B. S100B oxidation was analyzed by phosphorylation of the S100B species with CKII-α (Fig.7 A). The most potent oxidant we found is peroxynitrite anion (OONO−) (lane 3). In contrast to sodium tetrathionate which mostly oxidized S100B as dimer, OONO− stimulated both formation of intrachain and interchain disulfide bond"
https://openalex.org/W2051865613,"Haptoglobin-related protein (HPR) is a serum protein that is >90% homologous to the acute-phase reactant haptoglobin (Hp). Haptoglobin binds and removes free hemoglobin (Hb) from the circulation. Hpr levels are elevated with tumor progression in the serum of some cancer patients, but the relevance of this observation is not understood. HPR is an integral part of two distinct high molecular weight complexes (trypanosome lytic factor 1 (TLF1) and TLF2) that are lytic for the African parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Previous data indicate that HPR represents the toxic component of both trypanosome lytic factors. It has been proposed that after uptake by the parasite, Hb bound to HPR causes lysis in a peroxidase-dependent process. We report that the molecular architecture of HPR in normal human serum is different from that of Hp and that HPR does not bind Hb in normal human serum. Immunodepletion of all detectable Hb from TLF1 does not deplete TLF1 of HPR or trypanolytic activity, suggesting that the mechanism of parasite lysis is Hb-independent.

Haptoglobin (Hp) 1The abbreviations used are: Hp, haptoglobin; Hb, hemoglobin; HPR, haptoglobin-related protein; NHS, normal human serum; TLF, trypanosome lytic factor; HDL, high density lipoprotein; PNH, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. is an acute-phase plasma glycoprotein present in normal human serum (NHS) at concentrations of between 0.2 and 2 mg/ml. The major known function of Hp is to bind and remove potentially toxic free hemoglobin (Hb) from the circulation. Haptoglobin binds Hb with 1:1 stoichiometry with an extremely high affinity (Ka > 10−15m) (1Hwang P.K. Greer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3038-3041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Hp·Hb complexes are rapidly removed from the circulation via receptors in the liver. Haptoglobin is a heterodimer, and due to structural variation in the α chain of Hp α-β dimers, there are three Hp types in humans, namely Hp1–1, Hp2–1, and Hp2–2 (2Bowman B.H. Kurosky A. Harris H. Hirschhorn K. Advances in Human Genetics. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1982: 189-261Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Types 2–1 and 2–2 exist as a series of disulfide-linked polymers (2Bowman B.H. Kurosky A. Harris H. Hirschhorn K. Advances in Human Genetics. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1982: 189-261Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Haptoglobin-related protein (HPR) displays more than 90% identity to Hp and is found at a much lower concentration in serum (3Bensi G. Raugei G. Klefenz H. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The HPR gene arose by duplication of the Hp gene and is located 2.2 kilobase pairs downstream of the Hp gene on chromosome 16. There are 28-amino acid changes in HPR, 16 of which occur in the β chain. In addition, intron 1 of Hp is only 1.3 kilobase pairs, whereas that of HPR is 9.5 kilobase pairs and contains a retrovirus-like element (4Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6698-6709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is an Alu sequence in the 5′-flanking region of HPR (3Bensi G. Raugei G. Klefenz H. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6698-6709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HPR gene is also present in apes and Old World monkeys and is a product of a gene triplication event that occurred early in primate evolution (5McEvoy S.M. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15740-15747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In NHS, HPR appears to be associated exclusively with either a small HDL subpopulation or a high molecular weight protein complex (6Tomlinson S. Muranjan M. Nussenzweig V. Raper J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 117-120PubMed Google Scholar), both of which possess lytic activity against the African cattle parasiteTrypanosoma brucei brucei. The HDL trypanolytic factor is termed TLF1 and is composed of phospholipid, apoAI, apoAII, paraoxonase and HPR (7Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The second factor, TLF2, is a protein complex containing apoA1 and HPR (6Tomlinson S. Muranjan M. Nussenzweig V. Raper J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 117-120PubMed Google Scholar, 8Raper J. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The natural immunity of humans to T. brucei brucei but not to the morphologically indistinguishable human pathogens T. brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense that cause sleeping sickness is due to the selective killing of T. brucei brucei by TLF1 and/or TLF2. Consistent with an important role for HPR in trypanosome killing, sera from nonhuman primates that contain the HPR gene (see above) are trypanolytic (9Seed J.R. Sechelski J.B. Loomis M.R. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Hawking F. Ramsden D.B. Whytock S. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1973; 67: 501-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An exception is Chimpanzee serum, which is not trypanolytic. However, the HPR gene sequence in Chimpanzees was found to contain a frameshift mutation, resulting in premature termination of translation (5McEvoy S.M. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15740-15747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data indicate that trypanosome lysis is peroxide-dependent (7Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that like Hp, HPR binds Hb, and that TLF1-associated HPR·Hb complexes possess peroxidase activity at acid pH. After uptake and delivery to parasite lysosomes, the HPR·Hb complexes would kill trypanosomes by oxidative damage (7Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Other than its role in trypanosome lysis, there is no known function of HPR. A form of HPR apparently distinct from that found in NHS is found in the sera of cancer patients. Hpr levels appear to be useful as a clinical diagnostic marker, since they are elevated in progression and decreased during regression of various carcinomas (11Oh S.K. Kim S.H. Abbruzzi G. Adler W.H. Tauber A.I. Hybridoma. 1992; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 12Kuhajda F.P. Katumuluwa A.J. Pasternack G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NHS from a single healthy donor of Hp haplotype 1–1 was stored at −70 °C in aliquots for up to 6 months. Sera from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and Tangier disease were the kind gifts of Dr. W. Rosse (Duke University, NC) and Dr. Sachiya Ohtaki (Miyazaki Medical College, Fukuoka, Japan), respectively. Swiss Webster mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with T. brucei brucei TREU 667 stock (15Jennings F.W. Urquhart G.M. Murray P.K. Miller P.M. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1983; 77: 693-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the trypanosomes were harvested 2 days later from infected mouse blood and prepared for trypanolytic assay as described previously (16Lanham S.M. Godfrey D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Total lipoproteins were isolated from NHS by density gradient centrifugation, essentially as described (17Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragden J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Solid KBr was added to serum to give a density of 1.25 g/ml, and after ultracentrifugation (Beckman NVTi 60 rotor, 16 h, 49,000 ×g, 10 °C), the top 25% of the gradient containing lipoprotein was collected. The density of the lipoprotein fraction was then adjusted to 1.3 g/ml with KBr, and aliquots (4 ml) were layered under 0.9% NaCl (8 ml). After centrifugation for 3 h at 49,000 × g/10 °C (NVTi 60, Beckman), the HDL band was isolated. The crude TLF1 preparation was dialyzed against TBS at 4 °C with frequent buffer changes and then concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon (Beverly, MA) XM300 membranes. The TLF1 preparation (aliquots of 0.5 ml at about 50 mg protein/ml) was then fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) on Superose 6 high resolution 10/30 and Superose 12 high resolution 10/30 columns connected in tandem (0.2 ml/min in TBS, pH 7.0). Fractions were analyzed by absorbance at 280 nm, and TLF1 fractions were identified by measurement of trypanosome lytic activity in each fraction (8Raper J. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Tomlinson S. Jansen A.-M. Koudinov A. Ghiso J.A. Choi-Miura N.-H. Rifkin M.R. Ohtaki S. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fractions with peak trypanolytic activity were pooled and concentrated using Centricon 100 devices (Amicon), and aliquots were stored at −70 °C. Anti-Hb monoclonal (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) or polyclonal (Sigma) antibody was incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia) for 2 h at 4 °C. Ten μg of anti-Hb antibody was conjugated/μl of protein G-Sepharose. The conjugated beads were washed by centrifugation (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and resuspended to 50% (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were used to deplete TLF1 preparations of Hb. Fifty μl of TLF1 was treated with 4 μl of anti-Hb-Sepharose (or protein G-Sepharose as control) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the immunoprecipitate was isolated by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitates were washed 5 × with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed as described below. Hp·Hb complexes were used in control immunoprecipitation experiments and were prepared as described (8Raper J. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All samples were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4–15% acrylamide gradient gels (Bio-Rad) under reducing or nonreducing conditions by standard procedures (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and prestained broad range markers (Bio-Rad) were used as an indicator of complete transfer. Membranes with transferred proteins were developed by either chemiluminescence (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) (as described by the manufacturer) or by standard alkaline phosphatase detection. For Hp detection, membranes were probed with rabbit anti-human Hp (Sigma) at either 1,000 × dilution (for alkaline phosphatase detection) or at 10,000 × dilution (for chemiluminescent detection). For Hb detection, membranes were probed with goat anti-human Hb (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) at 2,500 × dilution, and bound antibody was revealed by means of protein A-HPR antibody at 2,500 × dilution (Cappel, Durham, NC) and ECL reagents (Amersham). Quantitation of Hp, HPR, and Hb was performed using a Western blotting procedure as described previously (6Tomlinson S. Muranjan M. Nussenzweig V. Raper J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 117-120PubMed Google Scholar). For assaying serum Hp and HPR concentrations, various dilutions of serum corresponding to 2–0.02 μl of serum were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (see above). Each gel run for quantitation purposes contained Hp and/or Hb standards of between 100 and 2.5 ng. Immunoblots were scanned, and immunostained bands were quantitated using NIH image 5.7 software. The distinction between Hp and HPR is based on molecular weight and has been previously described (6Tomlinson S. Muranjan M. Nussenzweig V. Raper J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 117-120PubMed Google Scholar). Hemoglobin used for standards was purified as described (18Tomlinson S. Jansen A.-M. Koudinov A. Ghiso J.A. Choi-Miura N.-H. Rifkin M.R. Ohtaki S. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Assays were performed as described previously (18Tomlinson S. Jansen A.-M. Koudinov A. Ghiso J.A. Choi-Miura N.-H. Rifkin M.R. Ohtaki S. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 trypanosomes were incubated with the sample under test in a total volume of 200 μl in high glucose Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Lysis was assessed by means of the fluorescent probe Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) after a 150-min incubation at 37 °C (18Tomlinson S. Jansen A.-M. Koudinov A. Ghiso J.A. Choi-Miura N.-H. Rifkin M.R. Ohtaki S. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Haptoglobin is a disulfide-linked heterodimer, and Western blot analysis of reduced purified Hp1–1 using an anti-Hp polyclonal antibody revealed the expected 15-kDa α and 40-kDa β chains of the protein (Fig. 1, lane 2). The corresponding subunits for HPR are 12 and 35 kDa, respectively (8Raper J. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Smith A.B. Hajduk S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10262-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and are shown in Fig. 1, lane 1. Purified TLF1 was the source of HPR. Native Hp1–1 exists as a disulfide-linked tetramer (α2-β2) (21Pintera J. The Biochemical, Genetic, and Clinicopathological Aspects of Haptoglobin. Williams & Wilkens, Baltimore1971Google Scholar), and as expected, an anti-Hp immunoblot of nonreduced Hp1–1 revealed a single 110-kDa protein (Fig.1, lane 4). In contrast, immunoblot analysis of nonreduced HPR revealed a major band of about 45 kDa and additional much fainter bands of about 90, 120, and 135 kDa, probably representing HPR multimers (Fig. 1, lane 3). Native Hp2–1 and Hp2–2 exist as disulfide-linked oligomeric complexes of between 200–700 kDa (21Pintera J. The Biochemical, Genetic, and Clinicopathological Aspects of Haptoglobin. Williams & Wilkens, Baltimore1971Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular architecture of native HPR is different to that of all Hp allotypes in that it appears to exist predominantly as a single α-β dimer. Hp binds free plasma Hb with high affinity, and Hp·Hb complexes are rapidly cleared from the circulation via hepatocyte receptors. We determined Hp and HPR concentrations in NHS and in sera from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) or Tangier disease. These conditions lead to extensive intravascular hemolysis, resulting in excess free Hb in the circulation and subsequent Hp depletion. As expected, the pathological sera contained very low levels of Hp; between 500–5,000-fold less than in NHS (TableI). In contrast, the concentration of Hpr in both NHS and pathological sera was similar. Therefore, unlike Hp, HPR serum concentration does not decrease in the presence of excess circulating plasma Hb. The simplest interpretation of these data is that either HPR does not bind Hb or that the hepatocyte ligand within HPR·Hb complexes is absent or obscured.Table IConcentration of Hp and HPR in sera from normal individuals and from patients with intravascular hemolysisSerumHpHPRμg/mlμg/mlNHS1 (Hp1–1)220041NHS2 (Hp2–1)155032PNH14037PNH23652Tangier 16529Tangier 29427 Open table in a new tab Table I also shows that the concentration of HPR in NHS is about 50-fold lower than that of Hp (Table I). This is much higher than the previously predicted 1,000-fold difference that was based on a comparison of mRNA levels of Hp and HPR (3Bensi G. Raugei G. Klefenz H. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In NHS, most plasma HPR is associated with the TLF1 complex, a small HDL subpopulation that possesses trypanosome lytic activity (6Tomlinson S. Muranjan M. Nussenzweig V. Raper J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 117-120PubMed Google Scholar, 7Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Partially purified TLF1 was fractionated by gel filtration, and two lytic TLF1 fractions eluting at slightly different molecular weights were selected. One contained a high HPR and a low contaminating Hp concentration (Fig.2, lane 1), and one contained low HPR and high Hp concentration (Fig. 2, lane 2). Each of these fractions was treated with anti-Hb monoclonal antibody bound to protein G beads, and the immunoprecipitate and supernatant were analyzed by anti-Hp Western blot. A quantitative determination of Hp, HPR, and Hb in the various anti-Hb immunodepleted fractions is shown in Table II. Fig. 2 and Table II shows that an anti-Hb antibody coimmunoprecipitated contaminating Hp from TLF1 preparations, but failed to coimmunoprecipitate HPR (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6, and Table II). Analysis of supernatants after anti-Hb immunoprecipitation shows that HPR remains in the supernatant (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4, and Table II). Not all Hp present is expected to contain bound Hb, so not all Hp was immunoprecipitated. Anti-Hb antibody was added in excess, as indicated by the quantity of control Hp·Hb complexes that were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2, lane 7 and Table II). Further analysis of anti-Hb-treated fractions by anti-Hb Western blot revealed the removal of all detectable Hb from TLF1 (Fig.3, Table II).Table IIQuantity of Hp, HPR, and Hb in TLF1 preparations after immunodepletion with anti-Hb monoclonal antibodySampleHbHpHPRMock-depleted TLF1 supernatant18.3451.7486.28Anti-Hb-depleted TLF1 supernatant–30.5690.92Mock-depleted TLF1 precipitate–––Anti-Hb-depleted TLF1 precipitate23.2521.22–Mock-depleted Hp · Hb supernatant33.5841.94–Anti-Hb-depleted Hp · Hb supernatant–20.19–Mock-depleted Hp · Hb precipitate–14.5–Anti-Hb-depleted Hp · Hb precipitate34.435.33– Open table in a new tab Figure 3Western blot analysis under reducing conditions of TLF1 immunoprecipitated and revealed with anti-Hb antibody.

Immunoreactive bands were visualized by means of anti-Hb polyclonal antibody and secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody and chemiluminescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been proposed that Hb bound to HPR kills T. brucei in a peroxidase-dependent mechanism (7Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the data presented above indicate that HPR does not contain bound Hb in NHS. Furthermore, Fig. 4shows that immunoprecipitation of TLF1 with either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to Hb did not remove trypanolytic activity from a TLF1 preparation. Table II shows that a fully lytic TLF1 preparation that has been immunodepleted of all detectable Hb (<3 ng) contains about 90 ng of HPR. Thus, even if very low levels of Hb are bound to HPR in TLF1, there is at a minimum a 30-fold excess of HPR over Hb (native molecular weights of HPR and Hb are similar). In a final experiment, excess exogenous Hb was added to TLF1, and its trypanolytic activity was measured. If Hb bound to HPR and represented the lytic moiety of TLF1, any exogenous Hb added to TLF1 would be expected to complex with the excess HPR and result in an increase in trypanolytic activity. The addition of Hb to TLF1 did not significantly affect TLF1 trypanolytic activity (Fig. 5). We conclude that Hb does not play a role in trypanolysis. We have studied certain properties of HPR in NHS and report several new findings. The molecular architecture of native HPR is distinct from that of Hp. Hpr levels in Hp-depleted patient sera are comparable to levels found in NHS, indicating either that HPR does not bind Hb or that HPR·Hb complexes (unlike Hp·Hb complexes) are not cleared from the circulation. We have not measured the turnover of HPR, but it is unlikely that the maintenance of HPR levels in serum of PNH patients reflects compensatory synthesis after clearance of HPR·Hb complexes. In fact, HPR in NHS does not contain any detectable bound Hb. Therefore, HPR does not share the principal function of Hp, which is to bind and remove free Hb from the circulation. This is consistent with earlier studies reporting no detectable peroxidase activity in HPR identified on native polyacrylide gels (22Fawcett H.A.C. Ziarih A-H. Brzeski H. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1048: 187-193PubMed Google Scholar). 2C. Shalitin, C. Valansi, A. Admon, B. Moskovitz, R. Segal, R. Epelbaum, and O. Nativ, submitted for publication. Finally, the present experiments show that the concentration of HPR in NHS is about 50-fold less than that of Hp, contrasting with the 1,000-fold difference previously predicted from mRNA quantitation (3Bensi G. Raugei G. Klefenz H. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The sequence of HPR is more than 90% identical with that of Hp, and the predicted Hb binding region of Hp is conserved. The inability of HPR to bind Hb may be due to a different pattern of disufide bonding that results in structural differences. Although both Hp and HPR contain the same total number of cysteines, the cysteine at position 15 of the Hp α chain that stabilizes the tetramer through cross-linking the monomers is replaced by phenylalanine in HPR (4Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6698-6709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with our observation that HPR exists predominantly as an α-β dimer. Though HPR can polymerize into higher order complexes, these are minor components (based on the faint staining with anti-Hp). It is also possible that the cysteines in HPR are conformationally shielded from one another, thus preventing oligomer formation. In NHS, total serum HPR appears to be distributed between two particles termed TLF1 and TLF2, both of which have trypanosome lytic activity. Susceptibility of trypanosomes to these lytic factors determine their human infectivity and defines their host range. There is compelling evidence that HPR represents the toxic component of these factors (6Tomlinson S. Muranjan M. Nussenzweig V. Raper J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 117-120PubMed Google Scholar,7Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The unusual hydrophobic N terminus of HPR in NHS (7Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) may be involved in its targeting to TLF1 (an HDL particle) and to TLF2 (a protein complex that contains the amphipathic apolipoprotein AI) (6Tomlinson S. Muranjan M. Nussenzweig V. Raper J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 117-120PubMed Google Scholar). However, the current data does not support the hypothesis that HPR-mediated trypanolysis is due to peroxidase activity of bound Hb (see the introduction). Although Smith et al. (7Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) detected Hb in their TLF1 preparation (as do we in the TLF1 preparations used in this study), the current data indicate that Hb is a contaminant and not a component of TLF1. So how does HPR mediate trypanosome lysis? The previous measurement of peroxidase activity in TLF1 may have been due to contaminating Hb, but the inhibition of parasite lysis by catalase indicates that endocytosed TLF1 causes parasite lysis via a peroxide-dependent mechanism (7Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition to Hb, heme/hemin, Fe3+, and Cu2+ can participate in peroxidation of lipids and proteins and cause cell damage through reactive oxygen intermediates. Hp is known to bind Cu2+ (24Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar) and heme (2Bowman B.H. Kurosky A. Harris H. Hirschhorn K. Advances in Human Genetics. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1982: 189-261Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and it is possible that HPR may similarly bind one or more of these molecules, resulting in a parasite lysosome-inducible peroxidase activity. An alternative and intriguing possibility is that the HPR in TLF may induce a parasite-specific peroxidase activity. Further characterization of HPR, in particular identification of a putative peroxidase-conferring moiety, may provide a better understanding of its precise role in trypanosome lysis. Such knowledge may be useful in creating drug delivery systems for African trypanosomes such as trypanolytic recombinant fusion proteins incorporating HPR and parasite receptor ligands. Other than its role in trypanolysis, there is no known function of HPR. Increased levels of HPR have been reported in sera from patients with various cancers, and HPR levels have been reported to correlate with tumor progression (11Oh S.K. Kim S.H. Abbruzzi G. Adler W.H.

Lev A. Valansi C. Aker O. Shalitin C. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This N-terminal extension appears to be due to an alternative processing of the HPR pre-mRNA, resulting in transcription of intron 1 and translation from the first AUG in intron 1 with the loss of exon 1. The relationship between the two forms of HPR is not known. We thank Drs. Jayne Raper and Mary Lee for critical discussions, Dr. Channa Shalitin for critical reading of the manuscript and sharing unpublished data, and Dr. Ronald Nagel for critical reading of the manuscript."

Sequence comparison of the two plant cDNAs and genes shows that the RPL4 gene has acquired a remarkable 3′ extension during evolutionary transfer to the nuclear genome.

Higher plant plastid ribosomes are closely related to those found in eubacteria, reflecting the endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts. They contain about 54–75 ribosomal proteins, depending on the plant species (1Harris E.H. Boyton J.E. Gillham N.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 700-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dorne A.-M.

The complete sequencing of several higher plant plastid genomes has shown that about one third of the plastid ribosomal (r) 1The abbreviations used are: r, ribosomal; RPL4, ribosomal protein L4; RT, reverse transcriptase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). proteins are encoded by the plastid genome itself (4Shinozaki K.

The remaining two thirds are probably encoded by the nuclear genome, and it is thought that the genes have been transferred from the plastid genome to the nucleus during evolution. From these nuclear-encoded plastid r-proteins, only few have been characterized by their cDNAs and/or by their genes (see Harriset al. (1Harris E.H. Boyton J.E. Gillham N.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 700-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and references therein). During the last 10 years ribosomal proteins became of special interest because it was shown in a number of cases that they have extraribosomal functions apart from the ribosome and protein biosynthesis (for review, see Wool (8Wool I.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 164-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar)). These extraribosomal functions concern basic cellular processes like replication, transcription, RNA processing, translation, and DNA repair. Specific functions in transcription have been reported for r-proteins S10 (9Friedman D.I. Schauer A.T. Baumann M.R. Baron L.S. Adhya S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In all three cases, the regulation by r-proteins concerns the expression of ribosomal components (rRNA, operon S10, and mRNA for r-protein S14). The plastid genome is transcribed by two different RNA polymerases. One is nuclear-encoded, T7-like, and especially active during early phases of plastid development. This polymerase is more or less specified for transcription of plastid housekeeping genes, encluding subunits of the second RNA polymerase, which is plastid-encoded, prokaryotic-like, and transcribes preferentially photosynthesis-related genes during later phases of plastid development (17Hess W.R. Prombona A. Fieder B. Subramanian A.R. Börner T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Lerbs-Mache S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The transcriptional activity of the prokaryotic-type RNA polymerase is regulated by nuclear-encoded, prokaryotic-type, and sigma-like factors (22Lerbs S. Bräutigam E. Mache R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 459-464Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Eisermann A. Tiller K. Link G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3981-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our group has been working for several years on the expression of rrn transcription in spinach plastids. Transcription of therrn operon is regulated by a transcription factor that we called CDF2 (24Baeza L. Bertrand A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3577-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CDF2 is supposed to act in a switching mechanism between the nuclear-encoded T7-like plastid RNA polymerase and the plastid-encoded Escherichia coli-like RNA polymerase (25Iratni R. Baeza L. Andreeva A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2928-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The first evidence that r-proteins could also play a role in regulation of rrn transcription in plastids came from CDF2 cross-linking experiments. Cross-linking of CDF2 to the 16 S RNA promoter is abolished by the presence of antibodies raised against 50 S r-proteins but not in the presence of 30 S r-proteins. 2L. Baeza, unpublished results. This result prompted us to analyze whether specific r-protein(s) co-purify with RNA polymerase and (or) CDF2. If so, they should represent candidates for r-proteins implicated in transcriptional regulation. To this aim we purified RNA polymerase together with the transcription factor CDF2 and we followed the co-purification of r-proteins with the transcription complex by antibodies raised against 50 and 30 S ribosomal proteins. We found that two r-proteins co-purify. In the present study we report on the cloning and sequencing of the corresponding cDNA and gene of one of the two r-proteins, the L4 protein, and on the partial characterization of the protein. The protein is nuclear-encoded and has not yet been analyzed in higher plants, and comparison with its cyanobacterial ancestor reveals remarkable differences. It belongs to the group of r-proteins for which functions in transcriptional regulation has been demonstrated in prokaryotes. A spinach cDNA λZAPII library (Stratagene) was screened with two degenerate oligonucleotides (5′-CCNTAYAARACNTCNAAYTTYTC-3′, 5′-GARACNTTYYTNAAYYTNAARAC-3′). Filters were prehybridized at 42 °C for 5 h, and hybridization was performed overnight at 38 °C (5 × SSC, 1% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine, and 0.02% SDS). Filters were washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min and twice at 40 °C for 15 min. Positive plaques were purified by two rounds of plating and hybridization. The pBluescript phagemid was recovered by excision according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the cDNA was sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). A spinach genomic library cloned in λEMBL3 (kindly provided by B. Pelzer-Reith, Berlin) was screened using the entire RPL4 cDNA as a probe. Filters were prehybridized and hybridized at 68 °C using the same protocol as for cDNA screening. The cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Washing of filters was at 68 °C for 15 min as for cDNA screening, but in addition at 68 °C for 30 min in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Positive plaques were purified by two rounds of plating and hybridization. λ DNA digests were subcloned into pUC18 for sequencing. 30 μg of genomic DNA were digested with the indicated restriction enzymes, and the digest was run overnight on a 0.8% agarose gel at 20 V. DNA was transferred to nylon membranes. Prehybridization and hybridization was performed for 5 h and overnight, respectively, at 42 °C in 5 × SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.1%N-laurylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS, and 45% formamide. TheRPL4 cDNA probe (530-bp 5′cDNA fragment) was labeled by random priming. The membrane was washed at room temperature for 10 min in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and twice at 65 °C for 15 min in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Total RNA was isolated from roots and cotyledons of 1-week-old spinach plantlets as described previously (20Allison L.A. Simon L.D. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2802-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA were used for RT-PCR reactions that were performed as described by Harrak et al. (27Harrak H. Lagrange T. Bisanz-Seyer C. Lerbs-Mache S. Mache R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed with an arbitrary sequence followed by a poly(T) tail (5′-CTTCCGATCCCTACGC(T)18-3′). One tenth of the reactions was PCR-amplified using the following primers: the preceding arbitrary primer with a strongly shortened poly(T) tail (5′-CTTCCGATCCCTACGCTTT-3′) and a primer corresponding to a region in the 3′ coding part of the RPL4 mRNA (5′-GCTGCAATGCAGAGGTGG-3′, thin arrow in Fig. 2). One half of the reaction products were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with the RPL4cDNA under the same conditions as described above; the other part of the reaction products were used for cloning and sequencing of the corresponding cDNA fragments. The sequence corresponding to the mature L4 protein was amplified by PCR and the product was cloned into the expression vector pET19b (Novagen). After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside the His-L4 fusion protein was purified on TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH). The eluted protein was further purified by SDS-PAGE. The L4 protein was excised from the acrylamide gel and the gel slice was directly used for antibody production (EUROGENTEC). The preparation of plastid anti-30 S and anti-50 S antibodies is described in Dorne et al. (2Dorne A.-M. Eneas-Filho J. Heizmann P. Mache R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Starting from Percoll-purified spinach chloroplasts (18Lerbs-Mache S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5509-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) the transcription factor CDF2 was purified successively on heparin-Sepharose, phosphocellulose, and 16 S-promoter-agarose columns. After each column all eluted fractions were tested by gel-retardation assays for the presence of CDF2 (not shown; for methods, see Baeza et al. (24Baeza L. Bertrand A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3577-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and Iratni et al. (25Iratni R. Baeza L. Andreeva A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2928-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). All CDF2-containing fractions were assembled, dialyzed before applying to the subsequent column. Fig.1 shows the electrophoresis profile of the assembled CDF2-containing protein fractions after phosphocellulose (lane 1) and 16 S promoter-agarose chromatography (lanes 2 and 3). Proteins from the first 1m NaCl elution step of the last column (lane 2) were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and tested either with preimmune serum (lane 6), with antibodies raised against total 50 and 30 S ribosomal proteins (lane 4) or with antibodies raised against T3 RNA polymerase (lane 5). From this result we can conclude that CDF2 co-purifies with the T7-like plastid RNA polymerase and two r-protein-like polypeptides on three different columns. The two polypeptides that cross-reacted with the r-protein antibodies were cut out and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined. The study of one of these proteins is presented here. We used the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the smaller one of the two proteins (ELIPLPILNFSGEKVAETFLNLKTA) to design two degenerate oligonucleotides and to isolate the corresponding cDNA. One hybridizing clone was obtained after screening of a leaf λZAPII cDNA library. The sequence is shown in Fig. 2 A(EMBL accession no. X93160). It corresponds to a polypeptide of 32.34-kDa calculated molecular mass including a 5.3-kDa transit peptide. The transit peptide starts with MA and contains 50% serine and threonine residues. These properties are characteristic of plastid transit peptides. The N-terminal sequence of the mature protein that was determined by amino acid sequencing is underlined. The protein is 33.7% identical in a 178 amino acid overlap to the ribosomal protein L4 from E. coli. Sequence comparison of the mature plastid L4-like protein with the corresponding E. coli protein shows the presence of a C-terminal extension. This extension is extremely negatively charged (62.5% of amino acids are glutamic or aspartic acids, see Fig. 5 for comparison). To ensure that this highly acidic extension does not correspond to a cloning artifact, we performed RT-PCR analysis using spinach cotyledon RNA. The size of the resulting cDNA of the complete RT-PCR reaction (Fig.2 B, lane 2) fits well to the expected size of 358 bp. The band was cloned and sequenced. It corresponds exactly to the part of the sequence encompassing the two primers as shown in Fig.2 A. However, a control PCR reaction using the same primers on a spinach DNA preparation yielded a band of much higher molecular mass (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). This DNA band of about 2 kb was also cloned and sequenced, and the DNA was subsequently used as hybridization probe to isolate genomic clones. We found that theRPL4 gene contains only one large intron. This intron comprises 1688 bp and is located in the 3′ part that encodes the acidic extension. The position of the intron is marked by an open triangle in Fig. 2 A. The gene sequence is accessible at the EMBL data bank (accession no. Y14932). None of the isolated cDNA clones contained a poly(A) sequence at the 3′ end. To locate the poly(A) stretch we used the method of Kudlaet al. (28Kudla J. Hayes R. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7137-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This method is based on RT-PCR using an arbitrarily 5′-extended oligo(dT) primer for cDNA synthesis. The subsequent PCR amplification was made using a primer that corresponds to the arbitrary primer and a primer located within the 3′-coding region of the RPL4 mRNA (thin arrows in Fig.2, see also “Experimental Procedures”). The reaction was performed with three different RNA preparations, RNA from roots (Fig.2 C, lane 1, overexposed in 1′), cotyledons of dark-grown plantlets (lane 2), and cotyledons of plantlets grown in normal light/dark cycle (lane 3). The four obtained DNA fragments were cloned and sequenced. They correspond to four different polyadenylation sites that are indicated byasterisks in Fig. 2 A. The distribution of the four differentially polyadenylated RNAs seems to vary in the three analyzed RNA preparations with a higher proportion of smaller mRNAs in dark-grown cotyledons and in roots (Fig. 2 C). Note that detection of root RNA needed 8 times longer exposure. Results of Fig. 1 show the co-purification of a L4-like protein with plastid RNA polymerase and CDF2, i.e. the protein exists in a soluble, non-ribosome-bound form or should be easily detachable from the ribosomal surface. To confirm that this protein represents indeed a plastid ribosomal protein, we isolated plastid 70 S ribosomes and separated the two subunits by sucrose-gradient centrifugation (2Dorne A.-M. Eneas-Filho J. Heizmann P. Mache R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The separation profile is shown in the top of Fig. 3 A. Peak 3 represents the 30 S ribosomal subunit, peak 4 the 50 S subunit. The proteins of regions 1–4 were precipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The filters were treated with antibodies raised against the plastid r-protein S1 (29Franzetti B. Carol P. Mache R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19075-19081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with antibodies raised against the plastid L4-like protein (Fig. 3 A, bottom). Both antibodies were prepared in rabbits using fusion proteins that were obtained by overproduction in E. coli and subsequent purification (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, the S1 protein is revealed only in the 30 S subunit fraction (Ab S1, lane 3), the L4-like protein is revealed in the 50 S subunit fraction (Ab L4, lane 4). The polypeptide profile of all 50 S ribosomal proteins is shown in Fig.3 B, on the left. The third largest protein corresponds to the r-protein L4 (Fig. 3 B, on theright). From these studies we conclude that one of the two anti-r-protein antibody reactive proteins present in the purified transcriptionally active fraction (Fig. 1, lane 2) is the plastid r-protein L4. To answer the question whether there exists two genes for the L4 protein, one encoding the acidic extension the other one not, we performed Southern analysis to estimate the gene number coding for the L4 protein. Genomic DNA was digested by five different restriction enzymes, and agarose-gel-separated digestion products were hybridized using radiolabeled RPL4 cDNA (Fig.4 A). With the exception of theSacI cleavage reaction, only one DNA band is labeled in each case. This strongly suggests the existence of a single gene only. The gene is highly expressed in leaf/cotyledon tissues (Fig.4 B). Northern analysis did not reveal any hybridization signal in root tissues (not shown). However, a RT-PCR-based amplification method demonstrates the presence of mRNA in roots. The mRNA level is slightly higher in cotyledons of dark-grown plantlets (Fig. 4 B, cotyledons/D) compared with cotyledons of plantlets grown in light/dark cycle (cotyledons/L). The mRNA level of cotyledons augments further if 1-week-old dark-grown plantlets are exposed to continuous light for 8 h (cotyledons/LD). The same relation of mRNA in cotyledons of plantlets grown in different light conditions was found by Northern analysis (not shown). To know whether the acidic extension of the L4 protein exists also in other plant species, we searched for the cDNA for the plastid r-protein L4 from Arabidopsis thaliana. An EST-tblastn search, using the first 110 N-terminal amino acids of the spinach protein, allowed us to detect the EST clone 116F23T7. The clone was obtained from theArabidopsis EST Stock Center and completely sequenced. The sequence is accessible in the EMBL data bank under the accession no.Y14565. The sequence comparison of the Arabidopsis protein with L4 r-proteins from spinach, one cyanobacteria, E. coli, and Plasmodium falciparum is shown in Fig.5. An acidic extension is also present in the Arabidopsis protein, but not in the cyanobacterial orPlasmodium proteins. This indicates that the extension was acquired after integration of the plastid gene into the nuclear genome during evolution. The Arabidopsis and the spinach protein sequences have an amino acid identity of 62.1% in a 282-amino acid overlap and possess highly conserved motifs in their transit peptides (40% amino acid identity). The Synechocystis L4 protein has the highest similarity to the higher plant plastid L4 proteins (52.9%) in accordance with the cyanobacterial origin of higher plant plastids. The amino acid sequence of the L4 protein of Porphyra purpurea is still 44.4% identical, but the similarity decreases to 31.9% for E. coli L4 and to 26.2% for the L4 protein of the plastid-like genome of the malaria parasite P. falciparum. To analyze whether the intron in the region of the highly acidic extension is conserved between species, we screened a genomic library of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia, that was cloned in λGEM11 using the cDNA as a probe. Two positive clones were selected and sequenced. The sequence is available at EMBL under the accession no. Y14566. The sequence shows that the Arabidopsis RPL4 gene also contains only one intron. This intron is much shorter (152 bp) than that of the RPL4 gene of spinach (1688 bp) but is located also at the 3′ end within the region coding for the acidic extension. The two intron positions are marked by filled triangles in Fig. 5. We have cloned and sequenced the cDNA and gene coding for the plastid ribosomal protein L4 from two higher plant species. Protein L4 is known to regulate the expression of the 11-gene r-protein operon S10 in E. coli (30Zengel J.M. Mueckl D. Lindahl L.

The RPL4 gene is also absent in the cyanelle genome of Cyanophora paradoxa(39Stirewalt V.L. Michalowski C.B. Löffelhardt W. Bohnert H.J. Bryant D.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Reptr. 1995; 13: 327-332Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and on the plastid genome of the nonphotosynthetic, parasitic plant Epifagus virginiana (40Wolfe K.H. Morden C.W. Palmer J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10648-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). It is therefore supposed that these genes have been transferred to the nuclear genome during evolution. This means also that the target of L4-mediated transcriptional regulation, i.e. the S10 leader region, has disappeared, and it raises the question whether any regulatory function of the L4 protein on the gene expression level has been conserved during evolution. In the present work we report on the co-purification of the plastid r-protein L4 with RNA polymerase and the transcription factor CDF2 in spinach. Our experiments were focused on the purification of the two CDF2 proteins of 30 and 33 kDa that were shown to cross-link to therrn operon promoter region (24Baeza L. Bertrand A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3577-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As preliminary cross-linking experiments in the presence of 50S r-protein antibodies had suggested that r-proteins are engaged in CDF2-DNA complex formation,2 we used an approach to test all column fractions for the presence of CDF2 by gel retardation assays and simultaneously for the presence of ribosomal proteins by antibody reactions on Western blots. We found that two potential r-proteins co-purified on three different successive columns with CDF2. One of them is the r-protein L4. This is shown by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and isolation and sequencing of the corresponding cDNA and gene. Sequence analysis shows that the spinach plastid L4 protein belongs to the nuclear-encoded plastid r-proteins that do not have N-terminal extension in addition to that of the transit peptide when compared with the E. coli counterpart (Fig. 5). The maturation site of the protein is exactly determined by the beginning of the N-terminal sequence of the mature protein (Fig. 2 A). We determined also the polyadenylation sites of the L4 mRNA (Fig. 2, A and C). We found four different polyadenylation sites that might be used differentially in root and cotyledon tissues. Whether poly(A) site selection contributes to regulation of gene expression remains an open problem. Up to now, no tissue-specific or development-specific alternative polyadenylation site selection has been described for plants. Many of the known nuclear-encoded plastid r-protein contain C-terminal extensions compared with their E. coli counterpart. However, the C-terminal extension of the L4 protein is unique in its amino acid composition. The evolutionary transfer of the RPL4 gene from the ancestral cyanobacterial genome to the host nuclear genome was followed with the acquisition of a highly acidic C-terminal protein domain. Such highly acidic C-terminal extensions are found in a number of chromatin-interacting proteins and transcription factors like transcription factor Dr1 (41Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I.

In the case of the HMG-D protein, it was shown recently that the acidic tail plays a role in alteration of the structural selectivity of DNA binding (44Ishimi Y. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7025-7029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acidic tail of the C31 subunit of yeast RNA polymerase seems to be engaged in transcription initiation (51Thuillier V. Stettler S. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Werner M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). E. coli r-protein L4 is an RNA-binding protein (52Zengel J.M. Lindahl L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2429-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanisms of the L4-regulated attenuation control of the S10 operon are not yet completely understood, it can be supposed that the L4 protein should interact with E. coli RNA polymerase and/or the NusA protein. Preliminary assays using renatured spinach plastid L4 protein in a heterologous system with E. coli RNA polymerase suggest that the plastid L4 protein enhances promoter binding of the E. coli enzyme (not shown). Further experiments to confirm this result and to establish a homologous transcription system for the two types of plastid RNA polymerases (E. coli-like and T7-like) (18Lerbs-Mache S. Proc. Natl.

It is tempting to speculate that the plastid L4 protein has acquired an acidic C-terminal extension to fulfill additional role(s) in transcriptional regulation. We thank M.

The interferon-α pathway is a model for these cascades. Two receptors, IFNaR1 and IFNaR2, associate exclusively in a constitutive manner with two JAK proteins, TYK2 and JAK1, respectively. Defining the molecular interface between JAK proteins and their receptors is critical to understanding the signaling pathway and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutics. This report defines the IFNaR1 interaction domain on TYK2. In vitro binding studies demonstrate that the amino-terminal half of TYK2, which is ∼600 amino acids long and contains JAK homology (JH) domains 3–7, comprises the maximal binding domain for IFNaR1. A fragment containing amino acids 171–601 (JH3–6) also binds IFNaR1, but with reduced affinity. Glutathione S-transferase-TYK2 fusion proteins approximating either the JH6 or JH3 domain affinity-precipitate IFNaR1, suggesting that these are major sites of interaction within the larger binding domain. TYK2 amino acids 1–601 act in a dominant manner to inhibit the transcription of an interferon-α-dependent reporter gene, presumably by displacing endogenous TYK2 from the receptor.

This same fragment inhibits interferon-α-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of TYK2, STAT1, and STAT2. Tyrosine kinase activation is a common mechanism for triggering eukaryotic signaling pathways. Receptor-type tyrosine kinases, which have extracellular ligand-binding domains and intracellular kinase domains, are activated following ligand-induced dimerization or oligomerization (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 2Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

The ligands for these receptors include a variety of growth factors, hormones, and cytokines. The interferon/cytokine family of receptors is a second class of receptors, which bind a similar spectrum of ligands and also appear to be activated following dimerization or higher order clustering (4Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 5Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). However, the latter receptors do not contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase domains, but rather associate in a noncovalent, constitutive manner with various members of the JAK kinase family (6Ziemiecki A.

The receptor-JAK complex appears to function completely analogously to a receptor-type tyrosine kinase.

A variety of studies demonstrate that both TYK2 and JAK1 are required for IFN-α signaling (14Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.

In addition to a carboxyl-terminal tyrosine kinase domain, these proteins contain a set of six other regions of homology known as JAK homology (JH) domains (18Harpur A.G. Andres A.-C. Ziemiecki A. Aston R.A. Wilks A.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1347-1353PubMed Google Scholar), which are common to all members (JAK1 (19Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Kurban R.R. Ralph S.J. Zurcher G. Ziemiecki A. Mol. Cell.

Adjacent to the bona fide kinase domain is a kinase-like domain, which apparently lacks catalytic activity and has no clear function. The amino-terminal half of the JAK proteins is composed of five shared domains (JH3–7), which are not found in any other known proteins. Neither Src homology 2 or 3 nor pleckstrin homology domains are present in the JAK proteins. The interferon/cytokine receptor cytoplasmic tails function as multipurpose docking proteins. In addition to sites for the binding of JAK tyrosine kinases, these receptors often contain tyrosine residues that are inducibly phosphorylated following ligand binding. Some of these phosphorylated sites bind Src homology 2 domains of signaling molecules, most notably the STAT transcription factors (4Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). For example, we have identified a binding site for STAT2 centered around tyrosine 466 of the IFNaR1 subunit of the interferon-α receptor (23Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized the TYK2-binding site on IFNaR1 in detail (9Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell.

The minimal binding domain is an ∼33-amino acid juxtamembrane region, overlapping the box 1 and box 2 sequences of IFNaR1 (24Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Nearly every phylogenetically conserved residue in the region is required for binding. However, the proline-rich box 1 sequence, which is not well conserved in IFNaR1, appears to play only a minor role in the TYK2-IFNaR1 interaction. In contrast, it has been reported that box 1 is a critical determinant of the binding domain in the cytoplasmic portion of other cytokine receptors (25Tanner J.W. Chen W. Young R.L. Longmore G.D.

Our results have also demonstrated that the TYK2-IFNaR1 interaction is absolutely required for signaling (24Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell.

In this report, we complement our previous characterization of the TYK2 interaction domain on IFNaR1 by identifying the regions of TYK2 that bind to IFNaR1. Our results show that most, if not all, of the amino-terminal half of TYK2 is required for this interaction. Interferon-α2 was a gift of J. Sepinwall (Hoffmann-La Roche).

Plasmids encoding GST-TYK2 fusion proteins were prepared by digesting the TYK2 cDNA with the appropriate restriction enzymes (illustrated in Fig. 3); blunting the ends as required; and ligating into the SmaI site of pGEX-1, -2T, or -3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). GST-IFNaR1 fusion proteins have been described previously (9Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell.

To express TYK2 in mammalian cells, the full-length cDNA (21Firmbach-Kraft I. Byers M. Shows T. Dalla-Favera R. Krolewski J.J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1329-1336PubMed Google Scholar) and subfragments, prepared by restriction digestion as illustrated in Fig. 1, were blunted to allow ligation into a version of the pMT2T expression vector (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containingPstI, EcoRI, NotI, and SalI cloning sites. Stop codons in all three reading frames are contained in the expression vector. In the case of the two double truncation constructs (which span amino acids 171–601 and 263–601, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 1), a cassette containing an HA tag and the 15 amino acids found at the amino terminus of TYK2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a previously described construct (29Davis E. Krishnan K. Yan H. Newcomb E. Krolewski J.J. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 543-551PubMed Google Scholar) and ligated upstream of the corresponding TYK2 fragments. The CD4-IFNaR1 chimera has been previously described (30Krishnan K. Yan H. Lim J.T.E. Krolewski J.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 125-133Google Scholar).Figure 1Schematic of TYK2 truncation constructs.Portions of TYK2 contained in various truncation constructs are illustrated. The top line is a partial restriction map indicating the sites used in generating the constructs (E, EcoRI; S, SalI; X, XhoI; B, BamHI; Af, AflIII; Aa, AatII). The second line illustrates the JH domain structure of TYK2, with eachbox corresponding to the indicated domain. JH1 is thebone fide tyrosine kinase domain, JH2 is the kinase-like domain, and JH3–7 are involved in receptor binding, as discussed under “Results.” The remaining lines indicate the extent of each construct relative to the restriction map and the JH domains.

Note that the last two constructs also contain an HA epitope and the first 15 amino acids of TYK2 at the amino-terminal end of the construct, although these have been omitted for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) U2OS cells were from American Type Culture Collection, and 293T cells were from H. Young (Columbia University). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum, split 1:10 (293T) or 1:7 (U2OS) from a newly confluent plate the day prior to transfection, and subsequently transfected as described (31Pear W.S. Nolan G. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) with calcium phosphate precipitates containing 10 μg of plasmid DNA/10-cm dish (see below for cotransfection protocol for luciferase assay). Two days post-transfection, cells were lysed as described previously (29Davis E. Krishnan K. Yan H. Newcomb E. Krolewski J.J. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 543-551PubMed Google Scholar). For the reporter gene experiments, U2OS cells were transfected with 5 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid, 5 μg of the ISRE-luciferase plasmid, and 10 μg of the expression vector (16Krishnan K. Pine R. Krolewski J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Lysates from transfected cells were incubated at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins, purified as described (23Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), already bound to the glutathione beads (Sigma) for 2–4 h. The complexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed three to four times, and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in preparation for immunoblotting (see below). Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 unit/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mmNaF, and 5 mm ZnCl2, and the proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated with a 1:50 to 1:200 dilution of the appropriate antibodies for 2–4 h on ice. The immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A beads, washed, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was sequentially reacted with a 1:1000 to 1:3000 dilution of the primary antibody, a 1:10,000 dilution of the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody (Sigma), and LumiGlo™ chemiluminescence reagent (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.) and then exposed to film. Thirty to thirty-six h after transfection, quadruplicate cultures were either treated with 3000 units of IFN-α2/ml for 18 h at 37 °C or left untreated, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.4 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.4)), lysed in the manufacturer's buffer (Promega), and rapidly frozen on dry ice. Lysates were thawed; cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation; and luciferase activity was measured following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega), whereas β-galactosidase activity was measured as described (32Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). To determine -fold induction, normalized activities were determined by dividing the luciferase activity by the β-galactosidase activity for each sample. Then, the normalized activity for the treated sample was divided by the normalized activity for the companion untreated sample. We have previously demonstrated that the TYK2-IFNaR1 interaction can be faithfully reproduced in vitro (9Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, to characterize the region of TYK2 required for binding to IFNaR1, we performed a series of analogous binding assays. Fig.1 illustrates the TYK2 constructs used in the first set of binding experiments. These fragments were transiently expressed at high levels in 293T cells; the lysates were affinity-precipitated with GST fusion proteins containing all or part of the cytoplasmic domain of IFNaR1; and the resulting complexes were immunoblotted. Fig. 2 A shows that a set of progressive carboxyl-terminal truncations were expressed at similar levels, but only the truncations terminating at amino acids 601 and 876 were precipitated as efficiently as full-length TYK2. The faint band observed in the other lanes was also seen in control experiments employing GST alone as an affinity precipitation reagent (data not shown). Probing the lower part of the same immunoblot with an anti-GST mAb demonstrated equal recovery of the fusion protein in each lane (data not shown). Assuming that residue 601 is the carboxyl terminus of the interaction domain, a second binding experiment was performed with fragments spanning residues 171–601 and 263–601. Since these constructs delete a portion of the region recognized by the anti-TYK2 mAb used to immunoblot in Fig. 2 A, an HA epitope tag was incorporated into the constructs. Fig. 2 B shows equivalent levels of expression for the constructs, whereas only construct 171–601 was affinity-precipitated by the GST-IFNaR1 cytoplasmic domain. Affinity precipitation with GST alone revealed no detectable binding (data not shown). Construct 171–601 appears to be bind less than full-length TYK2 (Fig. 2 B), whereas construct 1–601 appears to bind more avidly than full-length TYK2 (Fig. 2 A). Because these two constructs cannot be immunoblotted with the same antibody, we have not compared them directly. To demonstrate the specificity of the interaction, a subset of the lysates utilized in Fig. 2 A were precipitated with three separate GST-IFNaR1 fusion proteins: one containing the entire cytoplasmic domain of IFNaR1 (amino acids 466–557; used in Fig. 2, A and B), a second containing the juxtamembrane half of the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 466–511) that includes the entire TYK2-binding domain (9Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a third containing a mutant version of the same juxtamembrane region (denoted 466–511* in Fig.2 C) that does not bind TYK2 in vitro or in vivo (24Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the latter case, amino acids 504–506 (IIE) have been replaced with three alanines. Fig. 2 C shows that both full-length TYK2 (FL) and amino acids 1–601 bind to the entire cytoplasmic domain and the juxtamembrane portion, but not to the mutant. The construct containing amino acids 1–449 does not bind any of the three fusion proteins. As observed in Fig. 2 A, construct 1–601 appears to bind IFNaR1 more strongly than full-length TYK2. To confirm the data in Fig. 2 and to further characterize the interaction domain, a second set of in vitro binding assays were performed using GST fusion proteins (Fig. 3 A) corresponding approximately to individual TYK2 JH domains as well as various portions of the amino-terminal half of the protein. These GST-TYK2 fusion proteins were used to affinity-precipitate lysates from 293T cells transfected with a construct encoding a chimeric receptor consisting of the CD4 extracellular domain and the IFNaR1 cytoplasmic domain. This chimera co-immunoprecipitates endogenous TYK2 (24Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and can activate TYK2 when the CD4 extracellular domains are dimerized by antibody cross-linking (30Krishnan K. Yan H. Lim J.T.E. Krolewski J.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 125-133Google Scholar). We employed the chimera because CD4 antiserum is a sensitive reagent for immunoblotting (33Deen K.C. McDougal J.S. Inacker R. Folena-Wasserman G. Arthos J. Rosenberg J. Maddon P.J. Axel R. Sweet R.W. Nature. 1988; 331: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Four of the GST-TYK2 fusion proteins (indicated with plus signs in Fig. 3 A) displayed strong binding to the CD4-IFNaR1 chimera. Two contained regions of TYK2 corresponding to single JH domains (JH6 and JH3) (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and 7). In contrast, constructs encoding the JH4 and JH5 domains showed very little binding (lanes 5 and 6). Constructs that spanned amino acids 1–591 and 53–591 (lanes 10 and 11) also displayed strong binding, consistent with the data in Fig. 2. The fusion proteins encoding these longer constructs were expressed poorly, suggesting that when binding is normalized for protein content, these constructs bind IFNaR1 with significantly greater affinity than the single JH domains. Four other constructs displayed weak binding, despite adequate levels of expression (lanes 8, 9, 12, and 13). With the exception of one (amino acids 53–127, corresponding approximately to JH7), these all overlapped the JH3 or JH6 domain. To demonstrate that the interaction domain identified in vitrois relevant in vivo, we assayed the ability of various TYK2 fragments to inhibit IFN-α-dependent reporter gene activity. Previously, we have shown that overexpression of kinase-deficient TYK2 in U2OS cells can block the IFN-α-dependent expression of a luciferase gene under the control of an ISRE and a minimal promoter (16Krishnan K. Pine R. Krolewski J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Presumably, this dominant-negative effect is caused by the displacement of endogenous TYK2 from the receptor by exogenous, overexpressed, kinase-deficient TYK2, thereby preventing receptor-mediated TYK2 activation and subsequent STAT phosphorylation. Fig. 4 shows that TYK2 truncations corresponding to the IFNaR1-binding domain can also inhibit IFN-α-dependent reporter gene activity in U2OS cells. Specifically, carboxyl-terminal truncation constructs spanning amino acids 1–876 and 1–601 inhibited reporter gene activity relative to wild-type TYK2, whereas further truncation toward the amino terminus was ineffective. The extent of inhibition (∼50–60%) is quantitatively similar to that observed with the previously reported kinase-deficient TYK2 construct (16Krishnan K. Pine R. Krolewski J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A dominant inhibitory effect was not observed, however, for the double truncation spanning amino acids 171–601, although this construct binds in vitro (Fig. 2) and partially blocks STAT activation in vivo (see below). We hypothesized that the inhibition of ISRE-controlled luciferase activity resulted from displacement of endogenous TYK2 from the receptor. As a consequence of such displacement, tyrosine phosphorylation of TYK2 and both STAT1 and STAT2 should be inhibited. To test this, 293T cells were transfected with a subset of the constructs used in Fig. 4, and tyrosine phosphorylation was assayed. Because 293T cells can be transfected at very high efficiencies (>90%), an effector gene can be overexpressed in nearly every cell in a given culture. Thus, it is possible to determine the dominant inhibitory effect of the products of such transfected effector genes on endogenous proteins, as we have demonstrated previously (16Krishnan K. Pine R. Krolewski J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,23Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We did not employ 293T cells in the reporter gene induction experiments in Fig. 4, however, because E1A overexpression has been shown to inhibit STAT2 transactivation (34Bhattacharya S. Eckner R. Grossman S. Oldread E. Arany Z. D'Andrea A. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). As expected, IFN-α induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in 293T cells transfected with vector alone (Fig.5 A). In contrast, transfection of either the kinase-deficient TYK2 construct (K930I) or the construct containing amino acids 1–601 substantially blocks STAT1 phosphorylation. The construct containing residues 1–449, which does not bind IFNaR1 in vitro (Fig. 2), has no effect on STAT1 phosphorylation. Control blots demonstrate equal recovery of STAT1 in each lane and approximately equal expression of the appropriately sized TYK2 constructs in each set of transfectants. In Fig. 5 B, two double truncation constructs were tested in a similar experiment. Under conditions where construct 1–601 strongly inhibited STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, a construct spanning amino acids 171–601 was partially effective, whereas a construct spanning residues 263–601 was ineffective. Thus, the dominant-negative effect of the TYK2 truncation constructs correlates closely with the in vitro binding activity seen in Fig. 2. Finally, Fig. 5 C shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of TYK2 and STAT2 is also effectively blocked in cells overexpressing construct 1–601. Since cytokines regulate the growth, differentiation, and effector function of a wide variety of cells, characterizing the interface between cytokine receptors and JAK family kinases is important for understanding the biology of these cells and may eventually aid in the design of new drugs. Toward these ends, we have begun to define the interaction domains on both IFNaR1 (9Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Colamonici O.R. Uyttendaele H. Domanski P. Yan H. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and TYK2. This report demonstrates that the TYK2 domain spans the amino-terminal half of the protein. Specifically, in vitro binding of TYK2 truncation constructs to a GST fusion protein encoding the cytoplasmic domain of IFNaR1 reveals that maximal binding requires amino acids 1–601 of TYK2 and that weaker binding can still be detected with a construct encoding amino acids 171–601 (Fig. 2, A and B). These constructs correspond to the JH3–7 and JH3–6 domains of TYK2, respectively. Binding of the fragment containing amino acids 1–601 to the IFNaR1 cytoplasmic domain was disrupted by IFNaR1 mutations previously shown to abolish the ability of IFNaR1 to bind TYK2 and to mediate cell signaling (24Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T.E. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). A second set of in vitro binding studies (Fig. 3), using GST fusion proteins corresponding to TYK2 JH domains, indicate that the JH3 and JH6 domains are the major binding sites within the IFNaR1-binding domain. Although variable levels of fusion protein expression compromise our ability to precisely quantitate binding, the data indicate that the intervening domains (JH4 and JH5) bind the IFNaR1 cytoplasmic domain poorly. Longer constructs containing most or all of the JH3–7 domains appeared to bind IFNaR1 more avidly than the single JH3 and JH6 domains. Finally, two sets of dominant inhibitory experiments (Figs. 4 and 5) demonstrate that overexpression of the binding domain within the amino-terminal half of TYK2 effectively blocks both ISRE-driven reporter gene expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of TYK2, STAT1, and STAT2, presumably by displacing endogenous TYK2 protein from the receptor complex in the transfected cells. Interestingly, the TYK2 construct corresponding to amino acids 171–601 can dominantly interfere with TYK2 and STAT tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B), but is ineffective in blocking reporter gene expression (Fig. 4). This suggests that under the transfection conditions employed, submaximal STAT phosphorylation might nonetheless be sufficient to induce maximal levels of reporter gene transcription. However, these results might also reflect differences in the two cell lines employed. Overall, our data show that the binding of IFNaR1 to TYK2 requires a 601-amino acid region of TYK2 containing the JH3–7 domains, and within this region, the JH3 and JH6 domains appear to be particularly important. A number of cytokine receptor-binding domains within JAK family kinases have now been characterized. Chen et al. (35Chen M. Cheng A. Chen Y.-Q. Hymel A. Hanson E.P. Kimmel L. Minami Y. Taniguchi T. Changelian P.S. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6910-6915Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have recently reviewed these data. In the case of JAK2, which associates with a wide variety of receptors, binding to the growth hormone receptor appears to require the entire amino-terminal half of the protein (JH3–7) (25Tanner J.W. Chen W. Young R.L. Longmore G.D. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6523-6530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding to the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor requires only the JH6 and JH7 domains of JAK2, although this binding is quite weak (36Zhao Y. Wagner F. Frank S.J. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13814-13818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). JAK3 association with the common γ-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor appears to also be mainly mediated by the JH6 and JH7 domains, although the JH3–5 domains appear to also play a role (35Chen M. Cheng A. Chen Y.-Q. Hymel A. Hanson E.P. Kimmel L. Minami Y. Taniguchi T. Changelian P.S. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6910-6915Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Including our data on the TYK2-IFNaR1 interaction, there are two examples of two different classes of binding sites: one involving primarily the JH6 and JH7 domains and a second requiring the JH3–7 domains. Assuming that all cytokine receptor-JAK complexes are similar in overall topology, Chen et al. (35Chen M. Cheng A. Chen Y.-Q. Hymel A. Hanson E.P. Kimmel L. Minami Y. Taniguchi T. Changelian P.S. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6910-6915Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have attempted to reconcile the existing data by proposing the existence of two domains that mediate receptor binding by a given JAK protein. One domain would be in the JH6 and JH7 region, and a second would be somewhere in the JH3–5 region. One of these domains may act as a generic JAK-binding site, whereas the other could provide specificity for a given receptor. The pattern of binding observed for different receptor-JAK pairs would then reflect variation in the relative affinity of these two sites. In cases where the affinity of the two sites is similar for a receptor, then binding will appear to require most or all of the JH3–7 domains. In this scenario, the TYK2-IFNaR1 interaction would fall into this category. Our observation that the entire JH3–7 region is required for strong binding but that the individual JH3 and JH6 domains show some independent binding would be consistent with such a model. Characterization of additional receptor-JAK pairs, identification of the specific JAK residues required for binding, and the eventual solution of the three-dimensional structure of one or more receptor-JAK complexes will be needed to prove this model.

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan of the phylum Apicomplexa which includesPlasmodium, Eimeria, and other medically and agriculturally important pathogens. Although many of the structural and biochemical attributes of these pathogens are conserved, Toxoplasma is unusual within the phylum in several characteristics that are amenable to molecular genetic manipulations (1Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Russell D.G. Methods in Cell Biology. 45. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 28-63Google Scholar, 2Boothroyd J.C. Kim K. Sibley D. Soldati D. Boothroyd J.C. Komuniecki R. Molecular Approaches to Parasitology. 12. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1995: 211-225Google Scholar). For example, the lack of host cell specificity and rapid replication cycle allows one to quickly and inexpensively propagate this organism to high numbers in vitro. Since the parasite has a haploid genome in the asexual part of its life cycle, molecular genetic manipulations are not complicated by allelic copies, and generation of loss-of-function mutations can be done easily by a variety of methods (3Pfefferkorn E.R. Pfefferkorn L.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1976; 39: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 4Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1977; 44: 26-35Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5Pfefferkorn E.R. Pfefferkorn L.C. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, homologous and illegitimate recombination for the stable transformation of constructs into the genome of this parasite have been widely used in the analysis and complementation of different genetic loci (6Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 8Kim K. Boothroyd J.C. Clin. Res. 1993; 41: 209AGoogle Scholar, 9Sibley L.D. Messina M. Niesman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5508-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although genomic integration is conducive for a variety of genetic manipulations (e.g. increased stability of the transforming DNA, definitive replacement of a gene, etc.), some procedures are restricted by the nature of this transformation event. Using an episomal vector to stably transform a strain would bypass many of these obstacles and would allow easy recovery and/or removal of a given construct. The intrinsic instability associated with episomal DNAs allows definitive evidence for the association of a given phenotype to the DNA under examination using a molecular form of Koch's postulates. Since the vector would be independent of the parasite's genome, analysis of the activity attributed to the transformed DNA would simply require either isolating the episome to re-transform the parental strain or selecting against the episome using a negative selectable marker. In addition, as the episome does not directly interact with the genome, the probability of inducing a mutation as a result of integration is diminished. To obtain sequences that would allow independent replication and stabilization of episomes in Toxoplasma, we searched through the parasite's genome to recover sequences that demonstrate these attributes. Although the majority of the procedures previously used to isolate autonomous replicating sequences (ARS) 1The abbreviations used are: ARS, autonomous replicating sequences; HXGPRT, hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; EMS, episomal maintenance sequence; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MPA, mycophenolic acid; cfu(s), colony-forming unit(s); EM, episomal maintenance.1The abbreviations used are: ARS, autonomous replicating sequences; HXGPRT, hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; EMS, episomal maintenance sequence; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MPA, mycophenolic acid; cfu(s), colony-forming unit(s); EM, episomal maintenance. from eukaryotic organisms have utilized selectable markers (10Kelly J.M.

The selection for these sequences and characterization of a 500-bp fragment that possesses this activity are described in this report as is a test of an engineered shuttle vector in a complementation experiment. The RH strain (13Sabin A.B. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1941; 116: 801-807Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and mutants generated from this strain were grown in the tachyzoite stage for all experiments presented.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6269-6280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HXGPRT mutants in this strain consist of the RHΔHXGPRT knock-out strain (1Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Russell D.G. Methods in Cell Biology. 45. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 28-63Google Scholar, 15Pfefferkorn E.R. Borotz S.E. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the TXR-2 point mutant. TXR-2 was isolated from a population of RH mutagenized with 150 μg/ml N-nitroso-N-ethylurea (Sigma) for 60 min, syringe-released, and re-plated on a fresh monolayer for selection using 6-thioxanthine at 400 μg/ml (Sigma). After 2 weeks of continuous selection, clones were isolated that were incapable of growth under the selective pressure of mycophenolic acid confirming their status as deficient in HXGPRT activity (see below). The selection of parasites transformed with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was performed using 20 μmchloramphenicol (Sigma) as described previously (8Kim K. Boothroyd J.C. Clin. Res. 1993; 41: 209AGoogle Scholar). Strains deficient in HXGPRT activity were selected for the transformation of a construct bearing a form of the HXGPRT gene using 50 μg/ml mycophenolic acid (MPA) and 50 μg/ml xanthine (Sigma). Individual plaques of MPA-resistant clones were picked from monolayers overlaid with selective medium containing 0.9% Bacto-agar as described previously (1Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Russell D.G. Methods in Cell Biology. 45. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 28-63Google Scholar). All constructs used in the transformation of Toxoplasma in this report use the pANA vector backbone. This vector was generated by inserting a 90-bp sequence containing a centralNotI site flanked by two AscI sites in pUC19 at the AflIII site. Modifications of this vector include the following: 1) pANA-0.5, adding the 500-bpEcoRI/KpnI fragment of pEM1 (constituting the episomal maintenance sequence (EMS)) in the respective sites of the multicloning site (MCS); 2) pANAE, adding a blunted version of the 500-bp EMS in a blunted NotI site (outside the MCS); 3) pCANA, adding a blunted BamHI/HindIII tubulin-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cassette of pT/230 (16Soldati D. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) in a SspI site; 4) pCANA-1.9, the pCANA vector with the 1.9-kb KpnI fragment of pEM1 in the MCS; 5) pHANA, adding a DHFR-driven HXGPRT cassette of pmini-HXGPRT (17Donald R.G.K. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) in a SspI site; 6) pHANA-0.5, the pHANA vector with the 500-bp EMS in the uniqueEcoRI and KpnI sites of the MCS. The blunted restriction sites were generated using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, and all ligations were performed using T4 DNA ligase by standard techniques (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. J. Wiley and Sons, Inc., Boston1995Google Scholar). The pACYC184 vector (New England Biolabs) was used as a control for DNA extractions and subsequent transformations of E. coli. A genomic library of the PDS strain of Toxoplasma gondii (a clonal isolate of ME49 (19Ware P.L. Kasper L.H. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 778-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was used to select sequences bearing episome-stabilizing activity in the RH strain. This library was generated in the BamHI site of pANA using a Sau3AI partial digest of genomic DNA from which fragments 4–8 kb in size were gel-purified (Geneclean) using standard procedures (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. J. Wiley and Sons, Inc., Boston1995Google Scholar). Two additional libraries of RH genomic DNA were constructed similarly in pANA and pANAE for the isolation of the HXGPRT gene. The complexity of each of the three libraries was found to be 1–5 × 105 independent recombinants with >90% containing Toxoplasma genomic DNA as determined by the lack of β-galactosidase activity and size analysis of random clones. T. gondii (RH strain) were transformed with 50 μg of the PDS genomic library as described previously (20Soldati D. Boothroyd J.C. Science. 1993; 260: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In the first two rounds of selection for episomal maintenance, the transformed parasites were passaged twice in human foreskin fibroblasts monolayers and recovered to isolate genomic and episomal DNAs using the TELT procedure described below. The DH12 strain of E. coli was electroporated with the isolated DNA and plated on ampicillin plates to select for bacteria transformed with recovered episomal copies. Plasmid was extracted from the population of ampicillin-resistant bacteria for subsequent transformation into RH for additional rounds of selection. The population of plasmids carried through four passages of RH in the third round were re-electroporated into RH for an additional five passages in the fourth and final round of selection. Following recovery of episomal DNA from this population and transformation of E. coli, plasmids from 20 ampicillin-resistant bacterial clones were digested with RsaI and examined for the enrichment of certain library fragments as determined by their restriction pattern. Five distinct constructs were chosen based on the criterion of being represented at least twice among the bacterial clones examined. T. gondii DNA used in the preparation of genomic libraries was isolated from a freshly lysed culture in a single T-175 flask. Recovered parasites were syringe-released using a 27-gauge needle and separated from host cell debris using a 3-μm nucleopore membrane (Costar). Parasites were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in a lysis solution containing 120 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Sarkosyl, and 0.1 mg/ml of RNase A. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, proteinase K (1 mg/ml) was added for an additional incubation overnight at 55 °C. The genomic DNA was twice extracted with phenol:chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA. DNA of Toxoplasma used for the quantitation and analysis of episomal forms was extracted from parasites freshly lysed from T-25 monolayers using a modified version of the TELT extraction procedure (21Medina-Acosta E. Cross G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Parasites were syringe-released using a 27-gauge needle, pelleted, and lysed using a solution of 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 62.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 m LiCl, and 4% Triton X-100. Genomic and episomal DNA was extracted twice using phenol:chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA. To take into account the differences in recovery of episomal DNA and subsequent transformation of E. coli, equal amounts (∼1 ng) of the tetracycline-resistant plasmid pACYC184 were added to each pellet of cells prior to DNA extraction (pACYC184 possesses a plasmid p15 origin of replication that is compatible with the ColE1-type origin on the pANA-based vectors). Using this, the number of ampicillin-resistant colonies could be normalized to the number of tetracycline-resistant colonies obtained from the same electroporation. The pACYC184 “spike” also allowed the transformation efficiency of the extracted plasmids to be determined which in turn enabled the actual number of plasmid molecules per parasite to be estimated. To determine the actual number of transformation-competent episomes per parasite, this normalized figure was then multiplied by the difference between the number of TetR obtained from a known amount of the pACYC184 plasmid and the number recovered from the cell pellet after the DNA extraction procedure. For Southern blot analysis, genomic and episomal DNAs were digested with either EcoRI or PvuII, subjected to electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane for hybridization to random-primed radiolabeled probes corresponding to either the pANA vector or a 700-bp BamHI/NdeI fragment of the HXGPRT gene. Phosphorimaging analysis of hybridized membranes was done using the Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). AToxoplasma genomic DNA library was generated from aSau3AI partial digest of the PDS strain with an average insert size of 6 kb using the pUC19-based vector pANA. The PDS genomic DNA was used to generate the library as this strain has only recently been derived from an oocyst, whereas the RH strain has been in continuous lab passage for over 50 years. Thus, PDS is expected to have undergone fewer genetic alterations (i.e. deletions) under the selection for in vitro growth. The RH strain of Toxoplasma was electroporated with 50 μg of this library and passaged two times through confluent monolayers of human foreskin fibroblasts. After the second passage, genomic and episomal DNAs were extracted and electroporated into the DH12 strain of E. colifor selection of the episomes bearing the ampicillin resistance marker of pANA. Plasmids isolated from populations of ampicillin-resistant bacteria were re-transformed into the RH strain for an additional three rounds of selection. From the resulting population, 20 ampicillin-resistant E. coli colonies were picked and their plasmids analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion usingPvuII. Of these 20, 5 clones were chosen that showed distinct digestion patterns and appeared to be represented at least twice among those analyzed (data not shown). As our ultimate goal was to generate a shuttle vector forToxoplasma that could be efficiently retained in episomal form even in the absence of selection, the five isolated plasmids were analyzed for this property. After three passages of RH transformed with the isolated constructs and a pANA control, all five clones were at least 100-fold more efficient in maintaining the constructs as episomes in RH in the absence of selection when compared with the parental vector alone (see Fig. 1). Since the constructs of the library had an average insert size of 6 kb, a control construct in the same vector carrying a ∼5.8-kb XmaI fragment from a cosmid clone of SAG1 was similarly tested and demonstrated no stabilizing activity (data not shown). One of the five clones, named pEM1 (episomal maintenance), was arbitrarily chosen for further analysis. As the ∼6.8-kb size of the pEM1 genomic insert is excessively large for use as a stability element in episomal vectors, we sought to isolate a smaller sequence from this clone that possessed the same EM activity. As a first step in identifying the critical region in this insert, a restriction map of pEM1 was generated, and overlapping fragments of the insert ranging from 0.75 to 4.2 kb were isolated and cloned into pHANA (the modified form of pANA carrying hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT) driven by upstream and downstream non-coding sequences of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (17Donald R.G.K. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar)). A constant molar amount of each construct (5–10 μg each) was electroporated into a strain of RH deleted in HXGPRT open reading frame (RHΔHXGPRT (1Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Russell D.G. Methods in Cell Biology. 45. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 28-63Google Scholar, 15Pfefferkorn E.R. Borotz S.E. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) and grown in the presence of 50 μg/ml mycophenolic acid (MPA) and xanthine to select for HXGPRT expression. Only parasites transformed with the construct carrying a 1.9-kbKpnI fragment (pHANA-1.9) were able to survive after the second passage under drug pressure. DNA isolated from the third passage of these parasites revealed that at least part of the population carried the marker episomally (data not shown, but see below). It has been previously suggested that sequences in the dihydrofolate reductase gene of Toxoplasma are able to elevate the stable transformation frequency (6Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although there are only short regions of the DHFR locus in the pHANA vector and the aforementioned activity was not observed using other fragments of the pEM1 genomic insert, we chose to use a construct bearing a tubulin-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (pCANA) to examine the relative transformation frequency in a different context. Plasmids carrying the 1.9-kb fragment (pCANA-1.9) were compared with a control construct with a 2.0-kbPstI fragment of the parental EM1 clone that did not possess episomal maintenance activity (pCANA-2.0). Transformed parasites were passage three times in chloramphenicol and plated for plaque formation to compare the number of surviving parasites between the control and EMS-bearing constructs. Since chloramphenicol kinetics are such that parasite death is only detected during the third passage, approximately 16–20 generations would have occurred before the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase marker exerts its positive effects. The pCANA-1.9 fragment was determined to elevate the transformation frequency by ∼53-fold when compared with the pCANA-2.0 size control (data not shown). Although this indicates that the 1.9-kb fragment elevates the transformation frequency, more definitive evidence will be presented below demonstrating that the augmentation of transformation is a result of stabilizing the constructs in an episomal form, thus eliminating the requirement for the less frequent genomic integration event. As the 2.0-kb PstI fragment, which does not possess stabilizing activity, overlaps 1.4 kb of the 1.9-kb KpnI fragment, the remaining 500 bp of this DNA were examined for episomal maintenance activity. This region was cut out of the 1.9-kb parental sequence using flanking EcoRI and KpnI sites (KpnI derived from the multicloning site of pANA) and ligated into the pANA plasmid (pANA-0.5). The pANA and pANA-0.5 vectors were electroporated into RH and examined for EM activity in the absence of selective pressure as described above using pACYC184 to normalize for variations in DNA extractions and electroporations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.2 A shows that the number of colony-forming units/parasite arising from DNA of the pANA-0.5 transformants is maintained at a higher level than the number recovered from those electroporated with the pANA vector. As there is no detectable difference in activity when pANA-0.5 was compared with a pANA-based vector carrying the parental 1.9-kb fragment (data not shown), we conclude that this 500-bp sequence confers the episomal stability accredited to pEM1. Although the pANA vector carrying the EMS did not stabilize the vector at the same levels as seen with the parental pEM1 clone (see Figs. 1 and 2 A), we suggest that this variance is a result of the ∼6.8-kb difference in size between the two vectors as discussed below. The complete sequence for this 500-bp EMS has been determined (GenBank accession #AF009625). No significant sequence homology was detected when compared with the available data bases, and there were no conserved motifs apparent in comparisons with known autonomous replicating sequences and centromeres. Although Southern blot data indicate that the 500-bp sequence is found in a single copy in the genome (data not shown), this assay may not detect a small conserved motif that could be more abundant. The other four constructs isolated (pEM2 to pEM5) were not used to probe genomic DNA because the critical regions responsible for EM activity have not been identified to generate specific probes. Since the insert size of these constructs is ≥7 kb, of which it is suspected only a small portion actually confers episomal maintenance, finding multiple bands would be meaningless as one or more may result from the hybridization of repetitive elements carried in the genomic insert (22Ossorio P.N. Sibley L.D. Boothroyd J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Southern blots of PvuII-digested DNA from all five of the vectors isolated carrying EM activity (pEM1-pEM5) were individually probed with the 500-bp EMS or the pEM2-pEM5 constructs to determine if there are sequence similarities between the individual EMSs. No cross-hybridization between any of the five probes (outside of the common pUC19 backbone) was detectable. Thus there is no substantial similarity in the sequences found within the library inserts. Until the critical regions in the other four plasmids (pEM2-pEM5) are identified and sequenced, we cannot exclude that they share some small, critical motif. Regardless, for our purposes, the 500-bp EMS identified here is of convenient size and possesses the activity desired. To demonstrate active replication of the episomes, the methylation status of DNA recovered from Toxoplasma was examined using thedam methylase-sensitive restriction enzymes DpnI (only cuts DNA methylated by dam) and DpnII (will not cut dam-methylated DNA). Inasmuch as this methylase activity is not found in eukaryotic organisms, and the DNA used in all parasite transformations was from the dam(+) DH12 strain of E. coli, the loss of methylation (i.e. resistance to DpnI) would verify that the DNA was replicated by the parasite. Genomic and episomal DNAs isolated from the second and third passage from the experiment described above (data shown in Fig.2 A) were digested with either DpnI orDpnII and electroporated into E. coli. Fig.2 B shows that as early as the second passage, there is a clear difference in the number of colony-forming units arising from the digests between the EMS-bearing pANA-0.5 and parental vector. The activity of the enzymes in each reaction was confirmed by showing that the dam-methylated pACYC184 spike was virtually eliminated by the DpnI digest (≤0.01% number of cfus obtained without digest) and not affected by the DpnII digest (data not shown). These data demonstrate the active replication of unselected episomes carrying the 500-bp EMS. Interestingly, the DpnI resistance detected in the vector lacking the EMS (see Fig. 2 B) suggests that a small number of these plasmids was replicated by the parasite. Although this appears to be a significant alteration of the methylation status when compared with the pACYC184 control, there is no way of controlling for differences in accessibility of the enzyme between the vectors recovered from the parasites and the pACYC184 spike. The different methylation profiles of pANA and pANA-0.5 at the second and third passage indicate that the difference in the number of replicated (DpnI-resistant) episomes is due either to the specific replication of pANA-0.5 episomes (ARS activity) or “nonspecific” replication of the constructs with the selective maintenance of those bearing the EMS (centromeric activity). Nonspecific replication refers to an unidentified ARS-like activity already present in the vectors analyzed without the requirement for Toxoplasma sequences. This form of episomal replication was observed in Leishmania(22Ossorio P.N. Sibley L.D. Boothroyd J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and may be responsible for the prolonged transient transformation observed in Toxoplasma (see below). However, the relative numbers of enzyme-resistant vectors and the comparison of the total number of episomes between the EMS ± vectors (see Fig.2 B) suggest that the constructs of the pANA-0.5 transformation are being actively converted from aDpnII-resistant phenotype to one that is resistant toDpnI. This would support the hypothesis that the activity ascribed to the EMS is one of elevating the replication competency of the plasmid in Toxoplasma (i.e. ARS-like activity). The 500-bp EMS was subcloned into pHANA (pHANA-0.5) for a more quantitative analysis of transformation frequency under MPA selection in place of the slow kinetics of chloramphenicol activity. A total of 2 × 106 plaque-forming units of the RHΔHXGPRT strain were electroporated with 10 μg of pHANA or pHANA-0.5, and 5 × 103 or 1 × 103 were immediately plaqued with or without MPA, respectively. An additional sample (5 × 104) of this electroporated population was grown under MPA selection to propagate the HXGPRT-transformed parasites as a passage flask for subsequent plaque assays. After sufficient time for plaque development, the parasites plated for the plaque assay were fixed and stained for analysis, while those grown in the passage flask (which had not yet completely lysed) were syringe-released, counted, and plated for a second round of plaque assay (± MPA) and passage in MPA(+) media. This procedure was repeated for five passages. After the second passage, the population corresponding to the pHANA transformation was not able to form plaques in drug-free medium, whereas the pHANA-0.5 population maintained a consistent percentage of viability throughout the selection (see Fig. 3). The inability to form plaques in drug-free medium after growth in MPA demonstrates that the plaques of the second passage were not viable at the time of harvesting"

The Csk homologous kinase (CHK) is a recently identified tyrosine kinase which, like Csk, phosphorylates the C-terminal tyrosine of Src kinases, resulting in inactivation of these enzymes. Recently, we observed that CHK is associated with the ErbB-2/neu receptor upon heregulin stimulation of breast cancer cells. Here, we report that CHK expression was observed in 70 out of 80 primary breast cancer specimens but not in normal breast tissues (0/19).

In addition, we observed that the cytoplasmic domain of the ErbB-2/neu receptor is sufficient for its interaction with the CHKSH2 domain. Phosphopeptide inhibition of thein vitro interaction of CHKSH2 or native CHK with ErbB-2/neu, as well as site-directed mutagenesis of ErbB-2/neu, indicated that CHKSH2 binds to Tyr1253 of ErbB-2/neu.

Four members of the ErbB (HER) family are presently known: p170ErbB-1 (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF-R, epidermal growth factor receptor; HRG, heregulin; SH2 and SH3, Src homology domains 2 and 3, respectively; CHK, Csk-homologous kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHKSH2, GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of CHK; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.), p185ErbB-2, p180ErbB-3, and p180ErbB-4 (3Plowman G.D.

ErbB-2/neu undergoes autophosphorylation on five tyrosine residues that are located on its non-catalytic C terminus (19Ben-Levy R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Yarden Y.

Although overexpression of the ErbB-2/neu gene products contributes to the aggressive behavior of various human adenocarcinomas, including breast cancer (12Yamamoto T. Ikawa S. Akiyama T. Semba K.

Ligands that bind to and stimulate the kinase activity of ErbB family members have been identified and are classified as “EGF-like” ligands. Heregulin (HRG) and its rat homologue, neu differentiation factor (NDF), are a subfamily of neuregulins that bind to and activate both ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 (22Cohen J.A. Weiner D.B. More K.F. Kokai Y.

In contrast to Csk, which is widely expressed, CHK is highly restricted in its expression to brain and hematopoietic cells. Like Csk, CHK was also shown to phosphorylate pp60src in vitro on its C-terminal tyrosine (29Avraham S. Jiang S. Ota S. Fu Y. Deng B. Dowler L.L. White R.A. Avraham H. J. Biol.

Studies in which CHK or Csk was expressed in Csk-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts showed that murine p52 CHK was comparable to Csk in its ability to reduce the activity of the Src kinases Fyn and pp60src (37Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, we found a specific interaction between CHK and the HRG-activated ErbB-2/neu receptor in MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines. The CHKSH2 and CHKSH3-SH2 domains precipitated the tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB-2/neu receptor upon stimulation with HRG. In vivo association of the tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB-2/neu with CHK was also observed in co-immunoprecipitation studies using anti-CHK antibodies. This association of CHK with ErbB-2/neu occurred via the CHK-SH2 domain and appeared to be receptor-specific (e.g. ErbB-2/neu) and ligand-specific (e.g. HRG) (38Zrihan-Licht S. Lim J. Keydar I.

In this report, we characterize the binding of the SH2 domain of CHK to specific tyrosine-phosphorylated sites on ErbB-2/neu. Our results indicate that the CHKSH2 domain binds directly to ErbB-2/neu at the Tyr1253 site, which has been shown to confer oncogenicity to this receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CHK down-regulates ErbB-2/neu-activated Src kinases and is associated with anti-proliferative activities. Taken together, these results suggest a novel mechanism by which CHK alters ErbB-2/neu and Src kinases in breast cancer and thus may modulate growth of breast cancer cells.

The primers for the polymerase chain reaction were synthesized by an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystem model 394). Reagents for electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were purchased from Amersham Corp. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The MCF-7, NIH3T3, HeLa, COS, BSC-1, and CV-1 cell lines were all obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). MCF-7 cells stably transfected with CHK-Flag pcDNA3neo or pcDNA3neo constructs, resulting in CHK-Flag-MCF-7 or neo-1 cells, respectively, were previously described (38Zrihan-Licht S. Lim J. Keydar I.

MCF-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Prior to stimulation with HRG or EGF, cells were starved overnight in media containing 1% fetal bovine serum and then starved for 4 h in serum-free media. COS, HeLa, CV-1, and BSC-1 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Paraffin blocks from human primary breast carcinomas were serially sectioned at 5–6 μm. Tissue samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to identify “normal” as well as tumorous areas. Parallel sections were deparaffinized, washed in PBS, blocked (1% normal donkey serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h, and double-stained with rabbit anti-human CHK polyclonal antibody and mouse monoclonal antibody against ErbB-2 (Oncogene Science). Following washing, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:50) and rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies (1:100) (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Stained cells were analyzed using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope. The Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) confocal laser scanning microscope 410 is equipped with a 25-megawatt krypton-argon laser and a 10-megawatt HeNe laser (488, 543, and 633 maximum lines); co-localization analysis was performed on simultaneously labeled samples using the Zeiss co-localization procedure. This procedure results in a graphic representation of the distribution of green (y axis) and red (x axis) fluorescence for each pixel. Images were printed using a Codonics NP 1600 printer (Codonics, Middleburg Heights, OH). For confocal microscopy, CHK-Flag-MCF-7 cells were fixed and prepared as described previously (39Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with CHK antibodies (1:100 dilution) (Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h. Cells were washed in PBS, incubated with rhodamine-conjugated (rabbit IgG) antibodies for 1 h (Sigma), and examined using a Sarastro 2000 confocal laser scanning microscope (confocal laser scanning microscope, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). NEC and TEC chimeric plasmids containing the extracellular domain of EGF-R and the transmembrane domain of the ErbB-2/neu oncogene were previously described (19Ben-Levy R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J.

Transfections of NIH3T3 and COS cells were performed using LipofectAMINE reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 5 × 106 cells/plate TEC or NEC stable transfectants were starved for 4 h and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min at room temperature and analyzed as described previously (38Zrihan-Licht S.

For the immunoprecipitations, polyclonal CHK antibodies (10 μl), monoclonal EGF-R (10 μg/ml) (Santa Cruz, CA), or ErbB-2/neu (Ab-4) (Oncogene Science) (10 μg/ml) were used. The samples were analyzed by 7 or 10% SDS-PAGE as described (38Zrihan-Licht S. Lim J. Keydar I. Sliwkowski M.X. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1856-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), polyclonal EGF-R antibodies, or polyclonal ErbB-2/neu antibodies. The blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). Blots were stripped for 30 min at 55 °C in stripping buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). Cell lysates from COS cells transiently transfected with the neu*, P1, or Y1253F plasmids were added to the CHKSH2 GST fusion proteins (10 μg/incubation) that were preincubated with synthetic peptides as described previously (40Price D.J. Rivnay B. Fu Y. Avraham S. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5915-5920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then precipitated by the addition of glutathione 4B for 30 min at 4 °C. The washed precipitates were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides were linked to Affi-Gel 15 as described previously (40Price D.J. Rivnay B. Fu Y. Avraham S. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5915-5920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Peptide beads (15-μl bead volume) were incubated with 10 μg of CHKSH2 for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The washed samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. To test the binding of native CHK to the peptide beads, 15 μl of beads were incubated with 1.5 ml of MCF-7, CHK-Flag-MCF-7, or neo-1 cell extracts for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After three washes, the precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-CHK antibodies. The CHK cDNA (1.6 kb) was cloned into EcoRI sites in the PTM-1 vector. The NcoI site that includes the ATG initiation codon was added to the CHK sequence by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′ sense primer from nucleotides 269 to 296 and a 3′ antisense primer from nucleotides 510 to 481 (30Bennett B.D.

The polymerase chain reaction product was introduced to the vector at theNcoI-BstEII sites (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The construct was sequenced, and its expression was examined by transfection assay followed by Western blot analysis. Generation of recombinant CHK vaccinia virus was performed using the method described previously (41Elroy-Stein O. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6743-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The CHK vaccinia recombinant virus was used along with the T7 vaccinia recombinant virus for the co-infection assay, as follows: approximately 5 × 105 cells/plate were seeded. One day later, the cells were infected with trypsinized recombinant viruses 10 × multiplicity of infection each, for 1–2 h in 2.5% fetal calf serum/DMEM at 37 °C. Next, 5 ml of 10% DMEM were added, and the plates were incubated overnight. The infected cells were harvested the day after infection. Infections of transiently transfected COS cells were performed 2 days after transfections, as described above. Cells (103 cells/well) were spread in microtiter plates (96-wells), and the number of live cells was determined by using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide method (42Rosenthal A. Lindquist P.B. Bringman T.S. Goeddel D.V. Derynck R. Cell. 1986; 46: 301-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) at the indicated days after spread. Transformation of the cells was assessed by their ability to demonstrate anchorage-independent growth (42Rosenthal A. Lindquist P.B. Bringman T.S. Goeddel D.V. Derynck R. Cell. 1986; 46: 301-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). MCF-7, neo-1, or CHK-Flag cells (1 × 105 in 6-well dishes) were grown in medium containing 0.4% agar. After 2 weeks of growth, the colonies were visualized by staining with 0.33% iodonitrotetrazolium violet. All assays were performed in duplicate. MCF-7 cells were co-infected with the T7 polymerase vaccinia virus and CHK recombinant virus as described above. One day post-infection, the cells were starved for 4 h in serum-free media and then stimulated with 10 nm HRG as described previously (38Zrihan-Licht S. Lim J. Keydar I. Sliwkowski M.X. Groopman J.E.

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Src antibodies, and the washed precipitated proteins were submitted to kinase assay or analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In vitro kinase assays were performed by incubating washed Src immunoprecipitates with lysates from CHK-expressing or non-expressing cells in kinase buffer for 20 min at room temperature as described (14Muthuswamy S.K. Muller W.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 271-279PubMed Google Scholar, 15Muthuswamy S.K. Muller W.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1801-1810PubMed Google Scholar, 29Avraham S. Jiang S. Ota S. Fu Y. Deng B. Dowler L.L.

The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated CHK protein expression in 70 of 80 breast adenocarcinoma specimens (stage I, 32/41; stage II, 34/35; stage III, 4/4) but not in normal or benign breast tissues (normal breast and fibroadenoma, 0/19). Confocal microscopic imaging in primary breast tumors 6/6 (Fig.1 A) and activated T47D cells (not shown) immunostained for ErbB-2 and CHK indicated a similar pattern of distribution and co-localization of CHK and ErbB-2 (Fig.1 A). Our previous study indicated that upon HRG stimulation, CHK associates via its SH2 domain with the ErbB-2/neu receptor (38Zrihan-Licht S. Lim J. Keydar I. Sliwkowski M.X. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1856-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine further this interaction, confocal microscopy studies were performed in MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the CHK-Flag construct. We observed that CHK was localized to the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 1 B). However, upon HRG stimulation, CHK was redistributed to the subplasma membrane, away from the perinuclear regions (Fig. 1 B). These results, along with our previous results, suggest that upon ligand stimulation, CHK is translocated from the cytosol to the membrane vicinity and associates with ErbB-2/neu receptors. To verify that the association of CHK with ErbB-2/neu is mediated exclusively by ErbB-2/neu and not by other members of the ErbB family, we used chimeric molecules composed of the extracellular domain of the EGF-R and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of ErbB-2/neu. Two different EGF-R/ErbB-2/neu chimeric plasmids were used: the TEC construct which contains a point mutation (Val664 → Glu) in the ErbB-2/neu transmembrane domain causing constitutive activation of the molecule, and the NEC construct that contains the wild-type sequence of the ErbB-2/neu cytoplasmic domain and therefore can be stimulated by EGF (19Ben-Levy R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3302-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were stably transfected with either the NEC or TEC construct. The transfected cells were analyzed for construct expression by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis using anti-EGF-R antibodies. Upon EGF stimulation, CHKSH2 was associated with NEC (Fig. 2, B-II), whereas its as"
https://openalex.org/W2058570269,"The association of the transcriptional antitermination protein N of bacteriophage λ with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase depends on nut site RNA (boxA + boxB) in the nascent transcript and the host protein, NusA. This ribonucleoprotein complex can transcribe through Rho-dependent and intrinsic termination sites located up to several hundred base pairs downstream of nut. For antitermination to occur farther downstream, this core antitermination complex must be stabilized by the host proteins NusB, NusG, and ribosomal protein S10. Here, we show that the assembly of NusB, NusG, and S10 onto the core complex involves nucleotides 2–7 of λ boxA (CGCUCUUACACA) and is a fully cooperative process that depends on the presence of all three proteins. This assembly of NusB, NusG, and S10 also requires the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 73–107) of N, which interacts directly with RNA polymerase. NusB and S10 assemble in the absence of NusG when λ boxA is altered at nucleotides 8 and 9 to create a consensus version of boxA(CGCUCUUUAACA). These experiments suggest that multiple protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions are required to convert a core antitermination complex into a complete complex. The association of the transcriptional antitermination protein N of bacteriophage λ with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase depends on nut site RNA (boxA + boxB) in the nascent transcript and the host protein, NusA. This ribonucleoprotein complex can transcribe through Rho-dependent and intrinsic termination sites located up to several hundred base pairs downstream of nut. For antitermination to occur farther downstream, this core antitermination complex must be stabilized by the host proteins NusB, NusG, and ribosomal protein S10. Here, we show that the assembly of NusB, NusG, and S10 onto the core complex involves nucleotides 2–7 of λ boxA (CGCUCUUACACA) and is a fully cooperative process that depends on the presence of all three proteins. This assembly of NusB, NusG, and S10 also requires the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 73–107) of N, which interacts directly with RNA polymerase. NusB and S10 assemble in the absence of NusG when λ boxA is altered at nucleotides 8 and 9 to create a consensus version of boxA(CGCUCUUUAACA). These experiments suggest that multiple protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions are required to convert a core antitermination complex into a complete complex. The bacteriophage λ N protein allows Escherichia coliRNA polymerase to transcribe through termination signals in the early operons of the phage (1Richardson J.P. Greenblatt J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, DC1996: 822-848Google Scholar). In vivo, N requires a set of host proteins to mediate transcriptional antitermination. Mutations in thenusA, nusB, nusE (which encodes ribosomal protein S10), and nusG genes have been isolated that affect N function (2Friedman D.I. Olson E.R. Georgopoulos C. Tilly K. Herskowitz I.

The importance of these proteins in preventing termination at Rho-dependent and intrinsic termination sites has also been demonstrated in vitro(4Das A. Wolska K.

A cis-acting element, the nutsite, 1The abbreviations used are: nut site, N utilization site; bp, base pair(s). is situated between the promoter and first terminator of the early operons and is necessary for N-mediated antitermination (8Salstrom J.S.

Transcription of the nut site initiates the formation of a stable ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of N, the Nus factors, nut site RNA, and RNA polymerase (12Barik S. Ghosh B. Whalen W.

Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); and NusB and S10 form a heterodimer that binds a consensus boxA sequence (CGCUCUUUAACA) and the functionally related boxA elements of the seven ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons (UGCUCUUUAACA), but does not bind λ boxA (CGCUCUUACACA) (21Mason S.W. Li J. Greenblatt J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Whereas the complete antitermination complex can transcribe through multiple termination signals kilobases downstream of the nutsite, a core complex consisting of a subset of these factors can only antiterminate over short distances (6Mason S.W. Li J. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19418-19426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Whalen W. Ghosh B. Das A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, the core complex, which consists of N, NusA, and the nut site, contains all of the components required for antitermination, and the remaining components (NusB, NusG, and S10) are processivity factors that stabilize the core complex. Experiments that demonstrated that a boxA point mutation was more deleterious to antitermination in vivo than aboxA deletion raised the possibility that there exists an inhibitor of antitermination that binds boxA (25Patterson T.A. Zhang Z. Baker T. Johnson L.L. Friedman D.I. Court D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The existence of such an inhibitor would imply that, in addition to stabilizing the core complex, NusB and S10 would prevent the inhibitor from accessing boxA. In support of this is the observation that the nusB5 mutation has little effect on antitermination when boxA is deleted (25Patterson T.A. Zhang Z. Baker T. Johnson L.L. Friedman D.I. Court D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The nusE71 mutation, however, still impairs antitermination when boxA is deleted (25Patterson T.A. Zhang Z. Baker T. Johnson L.L. Friedman D.I. Court D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Considering that NusB is dispensable for antitermination in certain conditions (7DeVito J. Das A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8660-8664Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the primary role of NusB may be counterinhibition, whereas S10 may be critical for stabilizing the complex as well as for counterinhibition. N, RNA polymerase, and all four Nus factors can be assembled in vitro onto nut site RNA in the absence of a DNA template, and this process can be analyzed by sequential gel mobility shift assays utilizing 32P-labeled nut site RNA (16Mogridge J. Mah T.-F. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The present study was initiated to further understand the roles of NusB, NusG, S10, and boxA in stabilizing the assembly of a core ribonucleoprotein complex containing N, NusA, and RNA polymerase. We have determined that the assembly of any one of NusB, NusG and S10 onto the core complex in vitro depends on the co-assembly of the other two proteins and boxA, and is stronger with consensus boxA. Furthermore, consensusboxA allows for the assembly of NusB and S10 in the absence of NusG. The systematic mutagenesis of boxA has identified nucleotides 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (CGCUCUUACACA) as being specifically involved in the assembly of the complete complex. Using a series of N deletion mutants, we have determined that its carboxyl-terminal region is important for the formation of the core complex as well as for the assembly of NusB-S10. NusA, NusB, NusG, and RNA polymerase were purified as described previously (19Greenblatt J. Li J. Cell. 1981; 24: 421-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Li J. Horwitz R.

Purified S10 was generously provided by Dr. Volker Nowotny. All plasmids used were prepared in the bacterial strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified on Qiagen-tip 500 columns (Qiagen). The oligonucleotides used for cloning were purchased from ACGT Corp. (Toronto, Canada). RNAguard was bought from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Restriction enzymes and DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. T7 RNA polymerase was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. pNUT mutants were constructed as described previously (16Mogridge J. Mah T.-F. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed to amplify N or fragments of N from the plasmid pT7N (generous gift of M. Gottesman). Forward and reverse primers contained BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively, for subsequent cloning into the vector pGEX-2T. The E. colistrain TOPP2 (Stratagene) (6L) containing glutathioneS-transferase-N fusion plasmids was grown in LB medium to anA600 of 0.5 and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 rpm, resuspended, and sonicated in 50 ml of 1 m NaCl Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (4 ml; Pharmacia) were added to the supernatant, and this suspension was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed and resuspended in 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Thrombin (400 units) was added to the slurry and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm, the supernatant was collected and loaded on a P11 column that was equilibrated with 0.15m potassium acetate P11 buffer (0.05 m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 0.01 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA). Mutant N proteins were eluted with a linear gradient to 1.5 mpotassium acetate in P11 buffer. The E. coli strain TOPP2 (Stratagene) (6L) containing pT7N was grown to anA600 of 0.5 in LB medium and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended, and sonicated in 50 ml of 1 m NaCl Buffer A and then centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of buffer containing 6 m urea, 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This was incubated on ice for 2.5 h and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was added to 50 ml of 6 m urea P11 buffer and was loaded on a P11 column that was equilibrated with P11 buffer containing 6m urea and 0.15 m potassium acetate. The column was washed sequentially with P11 buffer containing 4 m urea and 0.15 m potassium acetate, P11 buffer containing 2m urea and 0.15 m potassium acetate, and P11 buffer containing 0.15 m potassium acetate. N was eluted with a linear gradient to 1.5 m potassium acetate in P11 buffer. Fractions containing N were pooled and dialyzed against buffer containing 0.05 m potassium phosphate pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then loaded on a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with the same buffer. N was eluted with a linear gradient to buffer containing 0.45m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The yield of N with this procedure was 5 mg/liter of culture. 32P-Labeled RNA for gel mobility shift experiments was produced in 10-μl reactions containing 1 × BRL T7 RNA polymerase buffer, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (NEN Life Science Products), 500 μm UTP, 500 μm ATP, 500 μmCTP, and 500 μm GTP, 1 unit/μl RNAguard, 50 μg/mlSalI-cut plasmid DNA, and 1.5 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. A total of 5 μl of 95% deionized formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol was added to the reactions, which were then incubated in a boiling water bath for 2 min and loaded on a 15% (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel and electrophoresed until the bromphenol blue had migrated two-thirds of the way down the gel. The labeled RNA was located by autoradiography; the gel slice containing the RNA was cut out and soaked in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water overnight. The yield of RNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (16Mogridge J. Mah T.-F. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), except that the reactions contained approximately 25 nm of radiolabelednut site RNA. The reactions contained 25 nm RNA polymerase core component, 100 nm NusA, 500 nmN, 100 nm NusB, 100 nm NusG, and 100 nm S10 or as otherwise indicated. Purification of N from the insoluble fraction derived from a high level overproducer of N led us to the realization that the N protein used in our previous gel mobility shift studies (16Mogridge J. Mah T.-F. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) contained a small amount of ribosomal protein S10 (data not shown). Our previous experiments had suggested that NusG could be assembled onto the core complex in the absence of NusB or S10. Therefore, we re-examined the assembly of NusB, NusG, and S10 onto the core complex in gel mobility shift experiments using the more highly purified N protein as well as a more highly purified NusG protein preparation (Fig. 1, lanes 1–9). Incubation of N, NusA, and RNA polymerase with RNA containing thenut site resulted in two weak slow migrating bands (lane 2). The lower of these bands forms in the presence of only RNA polymerase and NusA and is likely a complex of NusA, RNA polymerase, and the nut site RNA (16Mogridge J. Mah T.-F. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The upper weak band depends on the presence of N, NusA, and RNA polymerase, and its formation is impaired by boxB mutations that prevent the assembly of N-nut RNA or N-NusA-nut RNA complexes (16Mogridge J. Mah T.-F. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, this band likely represents the unstable core ribonucleoprotein complex. Addition of any one of NusB, NusG or S10 alone did not supershift the core complex (lanes 3–5). Furthermore, the addition of NusB-NusG, NusB-S10, or NusG-S10 did not supershift the core complex (lanes 6–8). Therefore, the complexes that we previously observed when subsets of NusB, NusG, and S10 were used to supershift the core complex could be attributed to small amounts of cross contamination in our purified protein preparations. A strong supershifted band was observed when NusB, NusG, and S10 were added together (lane 9). Thus, the assembly of NusB, NusG, and S10 onto the core antitermination complex depends on the presence of all three proteins. The substitution of consensus boxA for λ boxA(lanes 10–18) still did not allow NusB, NusG, S10, NusB-NusG, or NusG-S10 to supershift the core complex (lanes 12–15 and 17). However, the addition of NusB and S10 together supershifted the complex (lane 16). This result is consistent with our previous observation that a heterodimer of NusB and S10 can bind consensus boxA RNA in the absence of other proteins (22Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Further stabilization of this complex occurred when NusG was added to the reaction (compare lanes 16 and 18). As well, the addition of NusB-NusG-S10 to the core complex shifted more probe when the probe contained consensusboxA (compare lane 9 with lane 18), presumably because of the strengthened interaction between NusB-S10 and boxA. Point mutations were made at each position of boxA to further understand its role in the assembly of the complete antitermination complex (see Fig.2 (A–D) and TableI). Mutating position 1, 8, or 10 had little effect on the assembly of any of the complexes (e.g.Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2–5 to lanes 7–10). Mutating position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 of boxAallowed the formation of the core complex but almost completely prevented the formation of the complete complex (e.g.. Fig.2 A, compare lanes 3–5 to lanes 13–15). Since the critical importance of nucleotides 2–6 for the assembly of NusB-S10 onto rrn boxA had been demonstrated previously (22Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it was not unexpected that mutation of these nucleotides would also prevent the formation of the complete λ complex. Mutating position 7 also had little effect on formation of the core complex but in this case partially impaired formation of the complete complex (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 3–5 tolanes 8–10). Similarly, mutating this nucleotide of rrn boxA moderately impaired the formation of the rrn boxA-NusB-S10 complex (22Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mutating position 11 slightly reduced the formation of the core and complete complexes (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 3–5 to lanes 8–10), whereas mutating nucleotide 12 affected the complete complex more than the core complex (Fig. 2 D (lanes 13–15) and Table I). Therefore, nucleotides 11 and 12 may weakly interact with a component of the core complex, perhaps NusA. Mutating position 9 slightly weakened the formation of the RNA polymerase-NusA-nut site complex as well as the higher complexes (Fig. 2 C, comparelanes 2–5 to lanes 7–10). Thus, only nucleotides 2–7 and perhaps 12 of λ boxA are specifically involved in the assembly of the complete antitermination complex (see last column of Table I).Table IFormation of core complexes and complete complexes containing mutant boxA RNAsProbeboxA sequenceCore complexComplete complexComplete/ coreNUTWTCGCUCUUACACA++++>10NUTC1GGGCUCUUACACA++++>10NUTG2UCUCUCUUACACA++−0.5NUTC3GCGGUCUUACACA++−0.8NUTU4GCGCGCUUACACA++−0.1NUTC5GCGCUGUUACACA++−0.6NUTU6GCGCUCGUACACA++−0.1NUTU7GCGCUCUGACACA+++3NUTA8CCGCUCUUCCACA++++>10NUTC9GCGCUCUUAGACA++>10NUTA10CCGCUCUUACCCA++++>10NUTC11GCGCUCUUACAGA++>10NUTA12GCGCUCUUACACG++4NUTCONCGCUCUUUAACA+++++>10 Open table in a new tab N is a 107-amino acid protein with an RNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–22) (17Tan R. Frankel A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 28Lazinski D. Grzadzielska E. Das A. Cell. 1989; 59: 207-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), a NusA-binding region (amino acids 34–47), and a carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 73–107) that binds RNA polymerase (29Mogridge J. Legault P. Li J. Van Oene M.D. Kay L.E. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We have used carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of N to determine which parts of the protein are important for the formation of the core and complete complexes (see Fig. 3 A). N1–89(the first 89 amino acids of N), which has a truncated RNA polymerase-binding region, supported the formation of much less complete complex and only trace amounts of core complex compared with full-length N (compare lanes 13 and 14 tolanes 15 and 16). N1–47, N1–58 and N1–73, which contain only the RNA-binding domain and NusA-binding region, supported the formation of similar trace amounts of core complex as N1–89, but did not support the formation of the complete complex (lanes 7–12). N1–22 and N1–39, which contain only the RNA-binding domain, did not support the formation of either the core or complete complexes (lanes 3–6). These results showed that the carboxyl-terminal region of N is important for the stability of the core complex and critical for the formation of the complete complex. To further assess the importance of the carboxyl-terminal region of N for the assembly of NusB, NusG, and S10, we utilized a nutsite with consensus boxA for the mobility shift assays (see Fig. 3). Addition of NusB-S10 supershifted more core complex containing N1–89 and consensus boxA than core complex containing N1–73 and consensus boxA(compare lane 4 to lane 7). Similarly, a smaller amount of complete complex was detectable with N1–73 than with N1–89 (compare lane 5 to lane 8). Thus, the assembly of NusB-S10 is weakened when the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of N1–89 are deleted, which likely explains the inability of N1–73 to support the complete complex with λ boxA. The formation of some complete complex in Fig. 3 B with N1–73indicates that using consensus boxA for forming the complete complex can partly bypass a requirement for N to interact with RNA polymerase. Our observation that the N protein fraction used in our previous studies contained a small amount of ribosomal protein S10 prompted us to re-examine the assembly of N, RNA polymerase and the Nus factors onto nut site RNA. This new N preparation is free of significant contamination by S10 (or any other Nus factor) since it behaves identically to gel-purified N in mobility shift assays (data not shown). Our preparations of NusA, NusB, NusG, and S10 are also unlikely to be cross-contaminated to any significant extent since the addition of all four is required to form the slowest migrating complex with a wild type nut site (Ref. 16Mogridge J. Mah T.-F. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Our new experiments show that the stable assembly of NusB, NusG, or S10 onto a core complex containing N, NusA, and RNA polymerase depends on the co-assembly of the other two proteins. These results agree with in vitro transcription experiments that demonstrated that the omission of NusB, NusG, or S10 is equally deleterious to antitermination several kilobases downstream of the nut site (6Mason S.W. Li J. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19418-19426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, omission of any one of these factors prevented the protection from ribonucleases of the nut site RNA in active transcription complexes (30Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2141-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, other in vitroexperiments indicated that omission of NusB did not severely impair antitermination at terminators situated less than a kilobase downstream of the nut site (7DeVito J. Das A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8660-8664Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These results suggest that an antitermination complex that lacks only NusB may be stable enough to support antitermination at a terminator that is less than a kilobase downstream from the nut site, but too unstable to antiterminate over longer distances or to survive in certain in vitro conditions. Several groups have examined the effects of mutations in boxA on antitermination by N in vivo (25Patterson T.A. Zhang Z. Baker T. Johnson L.L. Friedman D.I. Court D.L. J. Mol.

Biol. 1994; 236: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Peltz S.W. Brown A.L. Hasan N. Podhajska A.J. Szybalski W. Science. 1985; 228: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 33Doelling J.H. Franklin N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5565-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Baron J. Weisberg R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1983-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, deletion of boxA had little effect on antitermination within several hundred bp of the nut site (25Patterson T.A. Zhang Z. Baker T. Johnson L.L. Friedman D.I. Court D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The more deleterious effects of point mutations than a simple deletion on antitermination have been explained by the possible existence of an inhibitor of antitermination that binds boxA RNA (25Patterson T.A. Zhang Z. Baker T. Johnson L.L. Friedman D.I. Court D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The existence of such an inhibitor makes it difficult to determine the role of boxA in stabilizing the assembly of the N-modified elongation complex from in vivo results. Deletion of boxA does impair the assembly of N-modified elongation complexes isolated in vitro (14Mason S.W. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2141-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and deletion of theboxA and interbox regions impairs the formation of antitermination complexes in gel mobility shift assays (16Mogridge J. Mah T.-F. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have now determined which boxA nucleotides are important for the in vitro assembly of N-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes by singly mutating each nucleotide of boxA away from the wild type sequence. Mutation of nucleotides 2–7 of boxA did not affect formation of a core complex containing N, NusA, and RNA polymerase and, instead, specifically impaired the formation of the complete complex. Mutating positions 1 and 8–12 of boxA either had no effect or slightly impaired the formation of both the core and complete antitermination complexes (see Table I). Some of these nucleotides in the 3′ region of boxA have been implicated in the binding of NusA to the N-nut site complex, 2T.-F. Mah, unpublished data. suggesting that NusA may interact with this region of the RNA. NusA contains three putative RNA binding domains, one S1 domain and two KH domains (35Gibson T.J. Thompson J.D. Heringa J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,36Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), and has been implicated in interacting with nucleotides in bothboxA and boxB (16Mogridge J. Mah T.-F. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2831-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The observation that thenusA1 mutation, which localizes to the S1 domain, still impairs antitermination when boxA is deleted led to the suggestion that NusA might not interact with boxA (32Zuber M. Patterson T.A. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4514-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that NusA can bind mutant forms of boxA (or unrelated sequences in this region), but with lower affinity. Alternatively, the S1 domain of NusA may recognize nucleotides in boxB or the interbox region, which is also important for antitermination (32Zuber M. Patterson T.A. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4514-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 33Doelling J.H. Franklin N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5565-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), while one of the KH domains interacts with boxA. The boxA mutations that affect the assembly of the complete complex, but not the core complex (i.e. mutations in nucleotides 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), correlate very well with rrn boxA mutations that prevent the binding of NusB and S10 torrn boxA in the absence of NusA, RNA polymerase, or other proteins (22Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mutation of nucleotides 2–6, 8, and 9 prevented the detection of NusB-S10-rrn boxA complexes, mutation of nucleotides 7 and 12 impaired the formation of these complexes, while mutation of nucleotides 1 and 11 had no effect on the assembly of NusB-S10 onto rrn boxA. Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that NusB-S10 interacts with nucleotides 2–7 of λ boxA and with nucleotides 2–9 of rrn and consensus boxA. Thus, λ boxA is effectively a mutant form of rrn boxA in which nucleotides 8 and 9 are altered so as to prevent the binding of NusB and S10 unless N, NusA, RNA polymerase, and NusG are also present. NusB-S10 can assemble onto an N-containing complex in the absence of NusG if nucleotides 8 and 9 of boxA are mutated to consensus nucleotides. What then is the role of NusG in stabilizing the assembly with a wild type nut site? Our experiments provide no indication that NusG interacts specifically with any nucleotides in thenut site, but NusG does interact with RNA polymerase (20Li J. Horwitz R. McCracken S. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6012-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although NusG does not bind strongly enough to NusB or S10 to supershift a NusB-S10 complex on rrn boxA RNA (22Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it may nevertheless interact weakly with NusB or S10 and thereby stabilize the interaction of S10 with RNA polymerase (14Mason S.W. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This would also explain the observation that NusG can stably assemble onto the core complex only in the presence of NusB-S10. The assembly of the complete antitermination complex depends on the carboxyl-terminal region of N. Compared with full-length N (107 amino acids), N1–89 supports the formation of reduced amounts of the complete complex and almost undetectable amounts of the core complex. We have shown elsewhere (29Mogridge J. Legault P. Li J. Van Oene M.D. Kay L.E. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) that amino acids 73–107 of N interact with the core component of RNA polymerase and are critical for antitermination even in the absence of NusB, NusG, and S10. Moreover, deletion of amino acids 90–107 substantially weakens binding to RNA polymerase (29Mogridge J. Legault P. Li J. Van Oene M.D. Kay L.E. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, N1–89 makes fewer contacts with RNA polymerase than does the full-length protein, resulting in the formation of less stable complexes. Eliminating the RNA polymerase-binding site by making a larger deletion in N to amino acid 73 eliminated all formation of the complete complex. This result implies either that interaction of N with RNA polymerase is necessary for forming the complete complex or that N73–107 has an additional interaction with NusB, NusG, or S10. When the nut site contains consensus boxA, N1–73 does assemble NusB-S10 and NusG onto the core complex, but still less efficiently than is the case with N1–89. Again, this may only mean that N1–73, which completely lacks the carboxyl-terminal RNA polymerase-binding domain of N, does not stabilize the core complex as effectively as N1–89, which can still weakly bind RNA polymerase. Nevertheless, even though the core complexes formed by N1–73 and N1–89 are barely detectable, it does seem that they are formed in similar amounts, suggesting that deleting the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of N1–89 may specifically impair the assembly of NusB-S10. It is, therefore, also possible that N facilitates the assembly of this complex by interacting directly with either NusB or S10. Independent evidence for an interaction between N and NusB comes from the observation that mutations in NusB that suppress the nusA1 mutation are specific for either the λ N protein or the related N protein of phage 21 (37Ward D.F. DeLong A. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is also possible that an interaction between the carboxyl-terminal region of N and RNA polymerase alters the conformation of RNA polymerase in such a way as to increase the affinity between RNA polymerase and S10. These experiments suggest that the conversion of a core antitermination complex containing N, NusA, and RNA polymerase to a complete antitermination complex additionally containing NusB, NusG, and S10 depends on nucleotides 2–7 of λ boxA and perhaps on the carboxyl-terminal 34 amino acids of N. The assembly of NusB, NusG, and S10 onto the core complex seems fully cooperative since subcomplexes lacking one or two of these proteins are evidently too unstable to detect by gel mobility shift assays. Our results suggest that numerous protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions are required for the cooperative assembly of NusB, NusG, and S10 onto the core complex."

RoBo-1 is abundantly expressed in bone, including the hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate where cartilage is remodeled into bone. RoBo-1 mRNA expression increased in response to two modulators of bone metabolism, estradiol and intermittent mechanical loading, suggesting a role in bone homeostasis. The 1.6-kilobase cDNA encodes a 240-amino acid protein with a cysteine spacing pattern, suggesting that RoBo-1 is a novel member of the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor/CD59/Ly-6/snake toxin family. Furthermore, the C-terminal contains a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol attachment site, suggesting that it is a cell surface protein similar to other mammalian members of this family. The strongest homology of RoBo-1 is to the snake serum-derived phospholipase A2 inhibitors, which uniquely contain two of the cysteine domains but are secreted proteins. Interestingly, RoBo-1 is likely the first membrane-anchored member of this family containing two cysteine domains. Thus, the tissue specificity, responsiveness to bone protective mediators, along with its relationship to the multifunctional urokinase plasminogen activator receptor/CD59/Ly-6/snake toxin family suggests that RoBo-1 may play a novel role in the growth or remodeling of bone.

To reduce the risk of fracture, the skeleton responds to local mechanical forces by forming new bone at these highly stressed sites (1Lanyon L.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Maintenance of bone tissue is a unique process that probably requires specialized proteins. Identification of the bone-specific proteins involved in this process could enhance our understanding and ability to treat bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Despite years of intensive study, very few proteins have been identified that are expressed primarily in bone tissue. The development of molecular biology techniques based on differential expression of mRNA provides new opportunities to identify novel bone-specific proteins such as the recently described osteoclast protease cathepsin K (2Tezuka K. Tezuka Y. Meejima A. Sato T. Nemoto K. Kamioka H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1106-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: DD-PCR, differential display polymerase chain reaction; PLA2, phospholipase A2; bp, base pair(s); uPAR, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor; m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G, P 1-5′-(methylguanosine)-P3-5′-GTP. (3Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar), we sought to identify new bone-specific proteins directly from whole bone tissue. We report here the discovery of a novel cDNA named RoBo-1 (Rodent Bone) that is expressed abundantly in bone, including the lengthening growth plate where cartilage is remodeled into bone, but is not significantly expressed in any other tissues examined. Bone strength is regulated by a coupled process of formation and resorption. These processes are regulated by both systemic hormones and local factors. For instance, after menopause or ovariectomy there is rapid loss of bone due to a relative increase of resorption relative to bone formation (4Canalis E. Regulation of Bone Remodeling. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 29-34Google Scholar). Administration of estrogen can prevent this loss of bone by restoring the balance of formation and resorption. However, mechanical forces are the predominant signal that determine the local architecture needed to provide optimum strength (5Frost H.M. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1988; 42: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The critical need for mechanical load is most obviously seen during immobilization and space flight where bone is lost rapidly despite normal hormone levels (6Bikle D.D. Harris J. Halloran B.P. Morey-Holton E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 30: E822-E827Google Scholar). Conversely, the application of repetitive forces to bone results in additional bone tissue being added to the mechanically stressed site to maintain the structural integrity of the bone (7Chow J.W.M. Jagger C.J. Chambers T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E340-E347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Torrance A.G. Mosley J.R. Suswillo R.F.L. Lanyon L.E. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1994; 54: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have observed that RoBo-1 mRNA levels increased after both estrogen treatment and with repetitive mechanical loading regimes in rats. RoBo-1 is a new member of the emerging multifunctional uPAR/CD59/Ly-6/snake toxin family (9Ploug M. Ellis V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Despite a diverse array of functions, the family is characterized by a motif of 8–10 similarly spaced cysteines forming a common three-dimensional structure (9Ploug M. Ellis V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Most of the members contain a single motif, except for uPAR, which contains three internal motifs, and the recently described snake serum-derived phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors, which contain two motifs (10Fortes-Dias C.L. Lin Y. Ewell J. Diniz C.R. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15646-15651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ohkura N. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The relationship of RoBo-1 to this family of proteins as well as its cellular localization and regulation suggests a novel role in bone metabolism. RNA for PCR experiments was purified from tissues from 4-month-old female CD rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) using an RNA isolation kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). 2Glaxo Wellcome meets or exceeds animal care and use regulations set forth in the Animal Welfare Act and its implementing regulations and is accredited by American Association of Laboratory Animal Care. Briefly, frozen tissues were pulverized under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and transferred to a 50-ml polypropylene tube. Immediately after the nitrogen evaporated, 10 ml of guanidinium thiocyanate solution containing 1 μl of antifoam A (Sigma) were added, and the tissues were homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkman Littau, Switzerland) at high speed. Homogenates were transferred to 15-ml Corex tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove particulates. The supernatant was removed and transferred to a 50-ml tube. RNA was isolated according to manufacturer's directions. mRNA was isolated from total RNA using oligo(dT) spin column kit from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The mRNA was double-selected according to the protocol. Total RNA from tibia, kidney, spleen, and brain was treated with RNase-free DNase using the Message Clean Kit from GenHunter Corp. (Brookline, MA) before DD-PCR. For DD-PCR, RNA from whole tibia, which included the periosteum, marrow, and epiphyses, was used. PCR was performed according to the GenHunter kit with the following modifications. Three separate reverse transcription reactions containing 0.2 μg of RNA was performed for each 3′ primer. These reactions were pooled to reduce variability in this step. For each arbitrary primer, duplicate PCR reactions were performed using 2 μl of the pooled reverse transcriptase reaction/20-μl reaction. Samples were thermocycled 40 times as follows: 30 s at 94 °C, 2 min at 40 °C, 30 s at 72 °C followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. 10 μl of the PCR products were diluted with 1 μl of 10 × gel loading buffer and analyzed on a 6% nondenaturing Tris-borate-EDTA gel. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight. Reproducible bands were excised, extracted, and reamplified according to instructions. Reamplified PCR fragments were subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega Madison, WI). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) miniprep kit. Amplitaq dideoxy sequencing was performed on a Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) ABI373A automated sequencer. Three independent full-length clones and one truncated clone were sequenced bidirectionally. Sequences were analyzed by Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corp.), and data bases searches were performed by both BLAST and FASTA algorithms. Multiple rat tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). For blots containing bone mRNA, 2 μg of double-selected mRNA made from total RNA prepared as described above was blotted to Hybond N (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) in 10 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15m sodium chloride, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and cross-linked with a Stratalinker (Stratagene) set on auto-cross-link. For Northern blots containing total RNA, the amount loaded is indicated in the figure legend. Primary osteoblasts were prepared and cultured as described previously (12Zaman G. Suswillo R.F.L. Cheng M.Z. Tavares I.A. Lanyon L.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and RNA prepared as described above. Prehybridization and hybridization was done in 6 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C. Probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham) using a random priming kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified using NucTrap columns (Stratagene). Approximately 1 × 106 cpm/ml were added. Final wash of blots was done in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. A custom made rat tibia Lambda Zap II cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened with the [32P]dCTP-labeled PCR product according to the manufacturer's directions. Multiple primary plaques were selected and rescreened until clonal. Clonal plaques were excised using the EXASSIST/SOLR system (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA was prepared using a Qiagen plasmid kit. RoBo-1 cDNA (nucleotides 69–886) was transcribed and capped (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G) according to the directions in Ambion's (Austin, TX) mMessage mMachine kit. RoBo-1 (0.3 μg/25 μl reaction) was translated with rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) in the absence or presence of 1.5 μl of canine microsomal membranes (Promega). 1.5 μl was analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For determination of N-glycosylation, 5 μl of the translational products were diluted in denaturing buffer (Oxford Glycosystems, Rosedale, NY), heated at 55 °C for 5 min, and treated for 18 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of peptide-N-glycosidase F (Oxford Glycosystems). One-fourth of the reaction was analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. In the rat tail vertebral compression model, pins were inserted into the seventh and ninth caudal vertebrae on 13-week-old female Wistar rats as described previously (7Chow J.W.M. Jagger C.J. Chambers T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E340-E347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the eighth caudal vertebrae were subjected to a single 5-min episode of axial loading using 300 cycle (1 Hz) to produce a peak strain magnitude of 700 microstrain over the cortex. These procedures were performed under general anesthesia (2% halothane in 2 liter/min of 02 and 1 liter/min of N2O). A control group was pinned but not subjected to the loading regime. Animals were sacrificed 1, 6, and 24 h after loading after intracardiac perfusion-fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, general anesthesia using 60 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium. Sixth and eighth caudal vertebrae were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for a further 24 h, decalcified in 10% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in paraffin wax. The nonsurgical axial loading system was used to load 16 100-g female Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (8Torrance A.G. Mosley J.R. Suswillo R.F.L. Lanyon L.E. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1994; 54: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In each case the left ulna was loaded, and the right ulna served as a control. The animals were placed in dorsal recumbency with the left antebrachium being held between two padded cups, one in contact with the olecranon process of the ulna, the other in contact with the flexed carpus. The loading protocol used a 1.5-Hz ramped square wave generated by Snapmaster for Windows (HEM Data Corporation, Southfield, MI) run into an Instron servohydraulic material testing machine. The animals were loaded for 10 min (1,200 cycles, 2 Hz) with the peak load set at 12 newton. After loading, the animals were allowed to recover and were sacrificed 6 h later. The left and right ulna were removed by careful dissection; with the removal of all muscle, the periosteum was left intact. The diaphysial region was removed, and the marrow cavity was flushed with phosphate-buffered saline. The bones were frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation. For estrogen experiments, female Sprague-Dawley rats, ovariectomized 4 weeks before (at ∼150 grams), received a single oral dose of estradiol (30 μg/kg). Control rats received vehicle control (10% EtOH, phosphate-buffered saline). Whole metaphyses from tibia were harvested for RNA isolation 24 and 48 h after administration of estrogen (13Suva L.J. Seedor J.G. Endo N. Quartuccio H.A. Thompson D.D. Bab I. Rodan G.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). RoBo-1 cDNA (nucleotides 69–886) was subcloned into the XbaI site of pBluescript II KS(−) (Stratagene). The vector was linearized with NotI and transcribed with T3 polymerase in the presence of 35S-UTP to generate the antisense probe. The sense strand was generated by linearizing with HindIII and transcribing with T7 polymerase. Mid-coronal sections of the vertebrae 6 μmthick were cut and mounted onto glass slides coated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Sigma). Prehybridization was performed as described previously (14Lean J.M. Jagger C.J. Chambers T.J. Chow J.W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E318-E327PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were hybridized against radiolabeled probe (5 × 104 cpm/μl) for 16 h at 45 °C in a humidified environment. Sections were rinsed 2 times with 2 × SSC at room temperature and incubated with ribonuclease A (50 μg/ml, Sigma) for 30 min in 2 × SSC at 37 °C. Sections were submitted to two more 1 × SSC washes at room temperature before final wash in 0.5 × SSC at 50 °C. The sections were dehydrated in graded alcohols containing 0.3 m ammonium acetate and air-dried. For autoradiography, sections were coated with nuclear emulsion K5 (Ilford, UK). After a two week exposure, slides were developed, counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin, and mounted. To identify mRNAs expressed exclusively in rat bone, we compared DD-PCR patterns from whole tibia to those of kidney, spleen, and brain. These tissues allowed us to eliminate potential common mRNAs from calcium-responsive, hematopoietic, and neuronal tissues respectively. Using a limited number of primer sets, we isolated 23 DD-PCR bands that were only visible in the lanes containing bone RNA. After subcloning, sequencing, and Northern blot analysis, only two were novel, bone-specific cDNAs. One of these novel cDNAs, which we named RoBo-1, hybridized to a 1.6-kilobase mRNA that was expressed abundantly in bone yet showed little or no expression in other tissues (Fig. 1 A, top blot). Using the cloned PCR product as a probe, we isolated three identical 1,607-bp full-length cDNA clones from a rat tibia cDNA library. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues using this full-length cDNA probe confirmed the tissue distribution of RoBo-1 (Fig. 1 A, middle blot). We also found RoBo-1 to be expressed in calvarial bone, caudal vertebrae, tibial marrow, and diaphysial bone denuded of marrow and periosteum (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, RoBo-1 was expressed in primary rat osteoblast cells isolated by sequential collagenase digestion (Fig. 1 B) (12Zaman G. Suswillo R.F.L. Cheng M.Z. Tavares I.A. Lanyon L.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Northern blot (Fig. 1 B) and PCR analysis (not shown) did not show expression of RoBo-1 in the osteoblast-like cell lines ROS 17/2.8 and UMR106. In addition, no expression was observed in the fibroblastic (Rat 1), the prostatic (MLL), nor the chondrocytic (IRC) cell lines (Fig. 1 B) (15Horton W.E. Cleveland J. Rapp U. Nemuth G. Bolander M. Doege K. Yamada Y. Hassell J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the bone-specific expression of RoBo-1 is further restricted to specific cell types or differentiation stages. The RoBo-1 cDNA contains a 110-bp 5′-untranslated region, an open reading frame of 720 bp coding for 240 amino acids (Fig.2), and 777 bp of 3′-untranslated bases. This 3′-untranslated region sequence contained one potential polyadenylation signal and a rodent B2 repetitive element (16Hendriks W. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9093Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). After removal of this repetitive element, we searched the DNA data bases and found no significant homology of the RoBo-1 cDNA to known sequences. Searching for protein homologies using the BLASTP algorithm revealed a significant homology of RoBo-1 to the 25 kDa (24% identity) and 30 kDa (26% identity) chains of the PLA2 inhibitor from monocled cobra Naja naja kauothia (Fig. 2) (17Ohkura N. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Using the FASTA algorithm, the strongest homology was found to be to a related PLA2 inhibitor protein, the Crotalus neutralizing factor (27.7% identity) from the South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus (10Fortes-Dias C.L. Lin Y. Ewell J. Diniz C.R. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15646-15651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarity of RoBo-1 to these proteins was estimated to be approximately 45–47% (18Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (7866) Google Scholar). Results of data base searching also revealed homology of RoBo-1 to the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). This correlation was significant since the snake PLA2 inhibitors and uPAR belong to a structurally related family of proteins that include uPAR, CD59, Ly-6, and snake venom neurotoxins (9Ploug M. Ellis V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although these proteins have diverse functions, the family is characterized by a common cysteine-rich domain of 70–90 amino acids containing 8–10 regularly spaced cysteines capable of forming disulfide bonds (Fig.3) (19Ploug M. Kjalke M. Ronne E. Weidle U. Hoyer-Hansen G. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the mammalian members of this family contain a single 90-amino acids cysteine-rich domain with the exception of uPAR, which has three sequential domains. Based on the cysteine spacing, RoBo-1 likely has two of these cysteine-rich domains similar to the snake PLA2 inhibitors, to which it has the closest homology. The first such domain (amino acids 29–108) contains 10 cysteine residues as well as the conserved family motif CCXXXXCN, whereas the second domain (amino acids 127–195) has 8 cysteines, similar to the snake toxins. RoBo-1 is the first mammalian protein identified to have two sequential uPAR/CD59/Ly-6-like domains. The computer program PSORT (Prediction of Protein Localization Sites) (20Nakai K. Kaneshisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) suggested that the 21 hydrophobic residues at the N terminus could function as a signal sequence indicative of a secreted or membrane-associated protein. PSORT also predicted that RoBo-1 could be a type 1 membrane protein containing a short, hydrophobic trans-membrane domain made up of residues 218–234, which would leave a cytoplasmic tail of only six amino acids. However, as an alternative to membrane insertion, PSORT revealed the presence of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage site, which suggested a potential covalent attachment to phosphatidylinositol on the cell membrane similar to other mammalian uPAR/CD59/Ly-6 proteins. We verified that the RoBo-1 cDNA could serve as a template for protein synthesis using in vitro translation in both rabbit reticulocyte (Fig. 4) and wheat germ extracts (not shown). These experiments revealed a predominant protein of 25–30 kDa, consistent with the predicted open reading frame of 26.2 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 1). The protein sequence contains four possible N-linked glycosylation sites. Co-translation in the presence of canine microsomal membranes resulted in post-translation modifications that increased the molecular mass to 37–40 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 2). Treatment of extracts containing this modified RoBo-1 with peptide-N-glycosidase F (21Plummer T.H. Tarentino A.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) reduced the molecular mass of the translated product to the original size (Fig. 4, lanes 3–5), which verified that RoBo-1 has at least one functional N-linked glycosylation site. To further localize the expression of RoBo-1 within bone, we performedin situ hybridization on longitudinal sections of rat caudal vertebrae. RoBo-1 cDNA showed labeling of the epiphyseal chondrocytes, where cartilage is resorbed and replaced by bone, as well as cells in the primary spongiosa (see Fig.5, panels A (low magnification) and B (higher magnification)). This area is responsible for bone growth, and impairment of its function is associated with reduced bone volume (22Amizuka N. Karaplis A.C. Henderson J.E. Warhsawsky H. Lipman M.L. Matsuki Y. Ejiri S. Tanaka M. Izumi N. Ozawa H. Goltzman D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). There was no labeling observed when the corresponding sense probe was used for hybridization (Fig. 5, panel C). As mentioned above, expression of RoBo-1 mRNA was not seen in the immortalized rat chondrocyte cell line (IRC) or in two chondrocyte-containing tissues, trachea (Fig.1 B) and ear (not shown). This specific expression of RoBo-1 in the epiphyseal chondrocytes and not in other cartilagenous tissues suggests that RoBo-1 is involved in forming mineralized tissue and may provide a marker for differentiation stages of chondrocytic cells. Since RoBo-1 is expressed in areas of bone lengthening and remodeling, we were interested in the regulation of the RoBo-1 mRNA in response to a known bone formation stimulus. The strength at each site in the human skeleton is determined primarily by local mechanical forces placed on the bone. Mediators such as estrogen, parathyroid hormone, or calcitonin also can have substantial effects on bone metabolism and bone mineral density. However, mechanical loading provides the critical signal that leads to formation of bone with the appropriate site-specific strength, density, and architecture. We examined in vivo regulation of RoBo-1 mRNA using two well characterized mechanical loading models capable of producing strains that induce bone formation. In the rat tail vertebral compression model, the eighth caudal vertebra is cyclically compressed along its length to induce bone formation (7Chow J.W.M. Jagger C.J. Chambers T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E340-E347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vertebrae were subjected to a single episode of axial loading at strains normally experienced by bones during use. After this intermittent mechanical loading, we observed a reproducible increase in the RoBo-1 in situ hybridization signal in both the growth plate and primary spongiosa. This signal reached a maximum by 6 h (Fig. 5, panels D (low magnification) and E(higher magnification)) and returned to base line 24 h after loading. No labeling was observed after hybridization with the sense probe (Fig. 5, panel F). In the axial ulna loading model (8Torrance A.G. Mosley J.R. Suswillo R.F.L. Lanyon L.E. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1994; 54: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), rat ulnae are compressed with intermittent mechanical forces that cause flexing at the weakest point along the bone. To adapt to these forces, new bone is formed at the site of deformation. Six h after this axial mechanical loading, RoBo-1 mRNA expression increased in the diaphysis of loaded ulnae compared with that of the contralateral control ulnae (Fig.6). When densitometric values for RoBo-1 were normalized for β-actin mRNA expression, the level of RoBo-1 mRNA expression was increased more than 2-fold relative to that seen in the control bones (control = 0.30 ± 0.06, loaded = 0.63 ± 0.09, p = 0.035). The data from the two in vivo loading models implies that RoBo-1 may provide an important function in the ability of the bone to adapt to external forces applied to the skeleton. Estrogen is known to have effects on bone mass, and removal of estrogen by ovariectomy results in the rapid loss of bone in rats (23Wronski T.J. Cinstron M. Doherty A.L. Dann L.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This loss can be prevented by restoration of estrogen. Since estrogen regulates bone metabolism and has been shown to alter the mRNA levels of known bone matrix proteins (24Salih M.A. Chung-Ching L. Arjmandi B.H. Kalu D.N. Bone Miner. 1993; 23: 285-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of estradiol on RoBo-1 mRNA levels in ovariectomized rats. A single oral administration of estradiol (30 μg/kg) in previously ovariectomized rats increased the RoBo-1 mRNA levels in the tibial metaphysis over that of the vehicle controls at 24 and 48 h (Fig.7). Increases in RoBo-1 mRNA levels were seen as early as 2 h after estradiol (data not shown). This regulation by a known systemic mediator of bone density is further evidence that RoBo-1 is involved in the metabolism of bone. We described here the discovery of the novel bone-specific protein, RoBo-1, that is abundantly expressed in rat bone mRNA. Based on its sequence homologies, RoBo-1 is a new member of the uPAR/CD59/Ly-6 snake toxin family. These proteins contain a fundamental structural unit of approximately 90 amino acids that includes 8–10 cysteines that form internal disulfide bridges. Of interest is the fact that all of the mammalian members to date have only one of these structural units, with the exception of uPAR, which contains three. Also, studies have shown that these proteins share a common genomic organization (25Casey J.R. Petranka J.G. Kottra J. Fleenor D.E. Rosse W.F. Blood. 1994; 84: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 90 amino acid structural unit of the single domain proteins is coded for by two exons. This suggests that uPAR arose from a common ancestral gene likely resulting from internal triplication of the two exons. Since RoBo-1 has two cysteine structural domains, it likely has a similar gene organization resulting from internal gene duplication of similar ancestral exons. In fact, preliminary PCR analysis of rat genomic DNA suggests that RoBo-1 has an exon structure like other members of this family. The closest homology of RoBo-1 is with the snake PLA2 inhibitors. These inhibitor proteins appear to have two cysteine domains, similar to RoBo-1. The Naja Naja PLA2 inhibitor functions as a heterotrimer composed of two 30-kDa subunits and a single 25-kDa subunit to inhibit PLA2. The Crotalus neutralizing factor PLA2 inhibitor functions as a oligomeric aggregate of 6–8 subunits to inhibit the actions of the PLA2 on cellular membranes. Although it is not known if RoBo-1 can inhibit PLA2, it is interesting to speculate that RoBo-1 may form functional homodimer, heterodimer, or oligomeric structures. To date, none of the known uPAR/CD59/Ly-6 members have been found localized in a specific tissue. However, RoBo-1 mRNA expression was detected selectively in bone tissue and in growth plate cartilage. It is significant that RoBo-1 is expressed at sites of endochondral and membranous bone formation. Endochondral bone is formed in the growth plate by resorption of the calcified cartilage and replacement with bone. On the other hand, intramembranous bone is formed by osteoblasts without a prior cartilage template. Since RoBo-1 is expressed in osteoblast and growth plate chondrocytes but not in other cartilage tissue such as trachea and ear, it is likely to be involved in the bone formation functions of these two different cell types. Both estrogen and intermittent mechanical stimulation are known to have net positive effects on bone density. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that estrogen modulates the ability of the skeleton to respond to mechanical forces (26Jagger C.J. Chow J.W.M. Chambers T.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). RoBo-1 mRNA levels increased after estrogen replacement following ovariectomy. Similar increases were seen in bones after mechanical stimulation. It is significant that we observed increases after mechanical stimulation at sites of both endochondral (growth plate) and membranous bone formation (diaphysis). Since RoBo-1 is up-regulated when bone is formed through two different mechanisms, it suggests that RoBo-1 is critical to the ultimate formation of mineralized tissue. Finally, the increased expression of RoBo-1 after mechanical stimulation and its homology to the snake PLA2 inhibitors is of particular interest for a number of reasons. After mechanical stimulation, there is a rapid, local increase in production of prostaglandins, which are potent regulators of bone formation and resorption (27Norrdin R.W. Lee W.S.S. High W.B. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1990; 41: 139-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28Rawlinson S.C. El-Haj A.J. Minter S.L. Tavares I.A. Bennett A. Lanyon L.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Since a key regulator of prostaglandin synthesis is PLA2, a highly tissue-restricted inhibitor could provide a mechanism for local control of prostaglandin-mediated bone formation. Another possible mechanism could be to regulate the PLA2 activity associated with the extracellular matrix vesicles produced by chondrocytes and osteoblasts (29Schwartz Z. Boyan B. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2191-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Schwartz Z. Dennis R. Bonewald L. Swain L. Gomez R. Boyan B.D. Bone (NY). 1992; 13: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These matrix vesicles play an important role in the mineralization process. Although the function of RoBo-1 remains to be elucidated, its protein homologies, abundant mRNA expression, tissue specificity, and response to positive mediators of bone density suggest that it provides a unique function in the growth or remodeling of bone.

The altered form of CODH (H265V) had a low nickel content and a dramatically reduced level of catalytic activity. Although treatment with NiCl2 and CoCl2 increased the activity of H265V CODH by severalfold, activity levels remained more than 1000-fold lower than that of wild-type CODH. Histidine 265 was not essential for the formation and stability of the Fe4S4clusters. The Km and KD for CO as well as the KD for cyanide were relatively unchanged as a result of the amino acid substitution in CODH. The time-dependent reduction of the [Fe4S4]2+ clusters by CO occurred on a time scale of hours, suggesting that, as a consequence of the mutation, a rate-limiting step had been introduced prior to the transfer of electrons from CO to the cubanes in centers B and C. EPR spectra of H265V CODH lacked the gav = 1.86 and gav = 1.87 signals characteristic of reduced forms of the active site (center C) of wild-type CODH.

The photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum is able to utilize CO as its sole energy source when grown anaerobically in the dark (1Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J.

CODH catalyzes the reversible oxidation of CO to CO2 and the reduction of a special ferredoxin that is the cooF gene product (3Kerby R.L. Hong S.S. Ensign S.A. Coppoc L.J. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J.

CODH has only two metal clusters, which have been designated as centers B and C (5Hu Z.G. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J.Q. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The latter contains a nickel atom bridged by an unknown ligand to an iron atom in one of the two [Fe4S4]2+/1+ clusters found in CODH (5Hu Z.G. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J.Q. Ludden P.W.

CO oxidation occurs at center C, and center B is proposed to mediate the transfer of electrons to CooF or artificial electron acceptors such as methyl viologen (4Ensign S.A. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18395-18403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Ensign S.A.

When purified from R. rubrum grown on nickel-depleted medium, CODH lacks both nickel and the ability to oxidize CO, yet retains both [Fe4S4]2+/1+ clusters (5Hu Z.G. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E.

CODH from R. rubrum is closely related to another class of anaerobic CO-oxidizing enzymes that, unlike CODH, also catalyze the synthesis of acetyl coenzyme A from CO, coenzyme A, and a methyl donor. The CO-oxidizing acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS), found in acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria, possesses center B and center C analogs as well as a third and unidentified redox center, which has been invoked in recently proposed mechanisms for the enzymatic oxidation of CO (25Anderson M.E. Lindahl P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8371-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,28Seravalli J. Kumar M. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11241-11251Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CODH/ACS also contains a second NiFeS cluster (center A) that serves as the site of acetyl-CoA synthesis (for a recent review of CODH/ACS, see Ragsdale and Kumar (10Ragsdale S.W. Kumar M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2515-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar)). Unlike the monomeric CODH from R. rubrum, the CODH/ACS enzymes are composed of multiple subunits among which the CODH and ACS activities are divided. In theClostridium thermoaceticum and Methanothrix soehngenii enzymes, the CODH activity appears to be localized in the β (CmbB) and α (CdhA) subunits, respectively (3Kerby R.L. Hong S.S. Ensign S.A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6037-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the significant sequence similarity of cmbB and cdhA genes to the cooS gene, which encodes the single subunit of the R. rubrum CODH (3Kerby R.L. Hong S.S. Ensign S.A. Coppoc L.J. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5284-5294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the structures of neither R. rubrum CODH nor the CODH/ACS enzymes are known, analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of cooS, cmbB (24Morton T.A. Runquist J.A. Ragsdale S.W.

Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar) from genome sequences allows the identification of conserved motifs and amino acid residues. In the absence of structural information, site-specific substitution of conserved amino acid residues is most likely to provide insight into the immediate environment of the metal clusters of CODH. Of the conserved residues, histidine 265 of the R. rubrum CODH was chosen for substitution as it is the only histidine conserved in all known CooS-like gene products. The selection of histidine was also guided by previous extended x-ray absorption fine structure studies that suggest one or more nitrogen-donor ligands to the nickel center of R. rubrum CODH (6Tan G.O. Ensign S.A. Ciurli S. Scott M.J. Hedman B. Holm R.H. Ludden P.W. Korszun Z.R. Stephens P.J. Hodgson K.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4427-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, the effect of substitution of valine for histidine 265 resulted in an intact CODH enzyme (designated as H265V) which partially lacked nickel and had a dramatically lower activity. The ability of nickel-deficient H265V CODH to incorporate nickel in vitrois shown here, and the catalytic activity and binding of CO and cyanide to nickel-treated H265V CODH has been investigated. The nickel-containing form of the enzyme does not exhibit the unique Cred1 and Cred2 EPR signals attributed to reduced forms of center C that were characterized in previous spectroscopic studies of CODH and CODH/ACS enzymes (see Hu et al. (5Hu Z.G. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J.Q. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and references therein). From these studies, we have developed the hypothesis that the ligand-mediated, electronic coupling between nickel and iron in center C has been disrupted or altered by the amino acid substitution. This does not adversely affect substrate or inhibitor binding; however, the modification greatly diminishes the ability of the enzyme to oxidize bound substrate. The conversion of CODH His-265 to Val used the restriction site elimination method (12Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) with some modifications (13Zhang Y. Burris R.H. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2948-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard media, antibiotic usage, and mating protocols were employed (14Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pUC19-derived template plasmid (pCO11, in Escherichia coli strain UQ1155) bears a 2.2-kbSalI fragment that encompasses all of cooS, the gene encoding CODH. This template was mutagenized in vitrousing a selection primer that converted an AflIII site to aBglII site in the vector, with a mutagenic primer that converted the His-265 codon (CAT) to a Val (GTT), and simultaneously created a HpaI restriction cleavage site (GTTAAC). The mutated cooS region was excised as a 1.2-kbNcoI-HindIII fragment, then cloned into similarly cut pCO12 (E. coli strain UQ1161), which bearscoo DNA extending 2.0 kb upstream of the NcoI site and 1.6 kb downstream of the HindIII site. The entirecoo region was subsequently introduced (as aPvuII fragment) into the mobilizable vector pUX19 cut with HincII. This construct, in E. coli S17-1 (UQ324), was mated to R. rubrum UR485 (cooS::aacC1), and the desired Km r Gmr Nxr recombinant was isolated. The merodiploid recombinant was resolved by growth for several generations in SMN liquid culture supplemented with Nx, followed by isolation of aKm s Gm s derivative, indicative of homologous recombination. The construct was verified by Southern analysis of chromosomal DNA, and the sequence of one strand of theNcoI-HindIII fragment cloned into pCO12 was verified (data not shown). Nickel-supplemented cell cultures of R. rubrum, strain UR499, were grown in medium (15Bonam D. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2980-2987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.05 mm NiCl2 and 3 g/liter each of yeast extract and casamino acids. Nickel-depleted cultures were grown according to previously published methods (9Bonam D. McKenna M.C. Stephens P.J. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All buffers used in the purification of nickel-deficient H265V from nickel-depleted cultures were passed over a metal-chelating column of Bio-Rad Chelex-100 cation exchange resin, and all buffer solutions contained 1 mm EDTA. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid colorimetric method using bovine serum albumin (grade A, Sigma) as a standard (16Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K.

The catalytic activity of the reverse reaction, CO2reduction, was measured according the method described by Ensign (17Ensign S.A.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analyses were performed according to published methods (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar). All samples were prepared in an anaerobic glove box (Vacuum/Atmospheres Dri-Lab glove box model HE-493) with an N2 atmosphere containing less than 1 ppm O2. The buffer used in each experiment was 100 mm MOPS that was adjusted to pH 7.3 with NaOH unless otherwise stated. Trace metal contaminants in buffers were removed by passing buffer solutions through a column of Bio-Rad Chelex-100. The ability of divalent metal cations to activate nickel-deficient H265V was tested by adding solutions of CoCl2, ZnCl2, MnCl2, NiCl2, or Fe(II) to solutions of nickel-deficient enzyme containing equimolar amounts of methyl viologen and sodium dithionite or titanium(III) citrate (7Ensign S.A.

TheKm for nickel activation was determined according to published methods (19Ensign S.A. Campbell M.J. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2162-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nickel-treated samples of H265V, freed from exogenous nickel, were prepared according to published methods (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cobalt, iron, manganese, nickel, and zinc were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at the University of Wisconsin Soil and Plant Analysis Laboratory. Iron and nickel were additionally measured using a Perkin-Elmer 3030 atomic absorption spectrometer. Enzyme samples were desalted on a column of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated in 25 mm MOPS that was adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH. A second column of Bio-Rad Chelex-100 anion exchange resin, equilibrated in the same buffer, was employed as a final preparation step to remove trace quantities of adventitiously bound metals. The forward, second-order rate constant for cyanide inhibition and the dissociation constants for CO and cyanide were determined according to previously published methods (8Ensign S.A. Hyman M.R. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4973-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Oxidized H265V was prepared by adding a slight excess of thionine (E°′ = 56 mV) or indigo carmine (E°′ = −125 mV) to enzyme samples desalted on Sephadex G-25 to first remove excess dithionite. Indigo carmine-oxidized, nickel-deficient samples of H265V prepared for EPR and UV-visible spectroscopy were passed through columns of Bio-Rad AG 1X8 and Chelex-100 cation-exchange resin to remove adventitiously bound dye (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and metals, respectively. Enzyme samples were fully reduced by adding 0.1 m sodium dithionite to a final concentration of 2 mm. Fully reduced, dithionite-free H265V CODH was oxidatively titrated with a 2.4 mm standardized thionine solution and analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. The CO-dependent reduction of the [Fe4S4]2+/1+ clusters was followed over time by measuring the loss in absorbance at 420 nm of solutions containing oxidized H265V that were incubated under a gas phase of 100% CO (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients previously reported for oxidized and reduced wild-type CODH are 34.3 and 20.1 mm−1 cm−1, respectively, at 420 nm (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded using a Varian E-15 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ER910A cryostat in the laboratory of Prof. George Reed in the Enzyme Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison. UV-visible spectra of samples anaerobically sealed in quartz cuvettes were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-1601PC spectrophotometer. In R. rubrum strain UR499, the H265V CODH was predominantly membrane-associated and accumulated to levels equivalent to those observed for CODH in wild-type strain UR2. These conclusions were based upon estimates of the amount of CODH protein in extracts of strain UR499 that were analyzed by immunological methods using anti-CODH antibody (data not shown). Thus it appeared that H265V CODH accumulated to normal levels and associated with its in vivo electron acceptor, CooF, which has been shown to serve as the membrane anchor for CODH. H265V CODH behaved like the wild-type enzyme in all steps of the purification except the heat treatment. Only 20% of H265V CODH was recovered following heating for 7 and 5 min at 60 and 80 °C, respectively, compared with a 60% yield reported for wild-type CODH (15Bonam D. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2980-2987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that H265V CODH might be less heat stable than the wild-type enzyme. The specific activity of H265V CODH in the crude extract was 0.8 unit/mg of CODH estimated as described above. The specific activity of purified H265V CODH was 0.67 unit/mg. H265V CODH, therefore, did not appear to be inactivated during purification. The rationale for the low activity of the enzyme in extracts will be discussed below. A final yield of 105 mg of highly purified H265V CODH was obtained from 120 g of UR499 cell paste. A nickel-deficient form of H265V CODH was also purified by the same method, and similar results were obtained, except that purified nickel-deficient H265V CODH had a specific activity of 0.01 unit/mg. The metal content of H265V CODH isolated from UR499 cultures grown in nickel-supplemented or nickel-depleted media were compared with the metal content of CODH from wild-type cultures grown similarly (TableI). Also included in the comparison is H265V CODH (from nickel-supplemented cells) that was treated with Ni2+ following purification. All forms of H265V contain 8 iron atoms, consistent with the presence of an intact center B and Fe4S4 component of center C. Thus, the substitution of valine for histidine 265 has no effect on the ability of the enzyme to ligand a full compliment of iron; UV-visible spectra of H265V CODH confirms this conclusion (see below).Table IMetal content and activity of H265V and wild-type CODHMetal content1-aManganese and cobalt levels were less than 0.01 mol of metal/mol of protein, and zinc was less than 0.13 mol of metal/mol of protein in all samples.Specific activityNi2+Fe2+CO oxidationCO2 reductionmol of metal/mol of proteinunits/mgNi-deficient H265V1-bPurified from cells grown on nickel-depleted medium.0.014 ± 0.0068.1 ± 1.2<0.01not measuredAs-purified H265V1-cPurified from cells grown on nickel-supplemented medium.0.24 ± 0.027.9 ± 0.60.67not measuredNi-treated H265V1-dAs-purified H265V CODH following treatment with Ni2+.2.4 ± 0.18.1 ± 0.42.40.003Wild-type1-bPurified from cells grown on nickel-depleted medium.,1-eWhen purified from cells grown on nickel-depleted medium, wild-type CODH has 0.01 to 0.02 mol of nickel and 7–8 mol of iron/mol of enzyme with an activity of 50 units/mg.

Open table in a new tab The H265V CODH isolated from UR499 cells grown with normal levels (0.05 mm) of Ni2+ in the medium consistently showed a low level of nickel in the “as-purified” form of the enzyme. Approximately 0.24 atom of nickel was observed per H265V CODH monomer compared with 1 atom of nickel per monomer of wild-type enzyme (TableI). The specific activity of the as-purified H265V CODH was increased approximately 4-fold by treatment with Ni2+ using the protocol for activation of nickel-deficient wild-type CODH (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the nickel site of center C is vacant in much of the population of H265V CODH isolated from UR499 cells grown in nickel-supplemented medium. Because the activity and the nickel content of H265V CODH did not decrease following gel filtration, metal-chelating chromatography, and treatment with 1.3 mmEDTA for over 1 h (data not shown), the low nickel content of H265V CODH samples does not appear to result from nickel loss during purification and handling. It seems likely, therefore, that nickel is poorly incorporated into H265V CODH in vivo as a consequence of the amino acid substitution. When H265V CODH purified from nickel-supplemented cultures was treated with Ni2+, the enzyme's nickel content increased by 10-fold to 2.4 nickel atoms per monomer, a level above that of the wild-type enzyme. It is not known if the greater than 1:1 molar ratio of nickel versus H265V CODH is significant, or if it reflects nonspecifically bound nickel in addition to that which is presumed to be incorporated into center C. The Km for the in vitro incorporation of nickel into nickel-deficient H265V CODH was determined by measuring the initial rate of activity increase versus nickel concentration. Compared with the nickel-deficient wild-type enzyme, theKm for nickel incorporation into H265V CODH is about 4-fold higher (Table II), which may in part explain the low efficiency of nickel incorporation in vivo.Table IIKinetics constants for Ni2+ activation, CO oxidation, and cyanide inhibition for H265V and wild-type CODHH265VWild-type2-aPreviously published results (4, 8, 19).Ni2+ activation, Km (mm)3.22 ± 0.890.755 ± 0.038CO oxidation Vmax(units/mg)2.54 ± 0.097,700 kcat (s−1)2.88,000 KmCO(μm)41.5 ± 5.632 KmMV(mm)2-bMV, methyl viologen.0.842 ± 0.0853.1Cyanide inhibition Second-order forward rate constant (m−1 s−1)63.5 ± 0.872.2 ± 1.8 KDCN−(μm)2.62 ± 0.078.46 KDCO(μm)1.114.702-a Previously published results (4Ensign S.A.

Open table in a new tab Manganese and cobalt levels in H265V CODH were negligible, and the level of zinc was only 0.13 atom per monomer (Table I). Thus, the center C nickel site of H265V CODH, as purified, did not appear to be occupied by a competing metal ion. Moreover, the ability of both the nickel-deficient and as-purified H265V CODH to incorporate nickel, as judged by the nickel-dependent increase in activity, suggests a vacancy in the nickel site, given that nickel-deficient wild-type CODH can neither bind nor be activated by Ni2+ if first treated with Co2+, Zn2+, or Fe2+ (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the activity of as-purified H265V CODH increased from 0.7 to 2.4 units/mg following treatment with Ni2+. Likewise, the activity of nickel-deficient H265V CODH increased from 0.01 to 2.2 units/mg when treated with Ni2+over a 3-h period (Fig. 1). Nickel-deficient H265V CODH was also treated with Co2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, or Mn2+. Of these, only Co2+ gave a form of the enzyme having measurable activity, which was approximately 20% of that observed with Ni2+(Fig. 1; data for Zn2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ not shown). This is in contrast to the 1000-fold greater increase in activity produced by Ni2+ versus Co2+ treatments of the nickel-deficient wild-type enzyme (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The activity of the cobalt-containing wild-type CODH, judged by the rate at which the Fe4S4 are reduced by CO (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is similar to the activity levels measured in this work for the nickel and cobalt-treated forms of H265V CODH. It seems interesting, therefore, that the amino acid substitution appears to greatly impair the activity of the nickel but not the cobalt-containing form of CODH. Because the Km for CO for nickel-treated H265V CODH is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table II; discussed below), low activity does not reflect an inability to bind CO; rather, it suggests an inability to catalyze the oxidation of CO that is bound to center C of H265V CODH. UV-visible absorption spectra of oxidized and reduced H265V CODH were found to be identical to those of wild-type CODH (data not shown), demonstrating that histidine 265 is not required for assembly of the Fe4S4 clusters. The molar extinction coefficients at 420 nm (ε420) for oxidized and reduced H265V CODH were 36.2 and 20.1 mmol−1 cm−1, respectively. These values are essentially identical to those of the wild-type enzyme (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nickel does not contribute to the UV-visible spectrum of the enzyme (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It was previously shown by Ensign et al. (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that the Fe4S4 centers of nickel-deficient CODH are neither reduced by CO directly nor indirectly through protein to protein electron transfer from the trace of active (i.e.nickel-containing) CODH background. In the present study, the catalytic competence of H265V CODH samples was assessed by monitoring at 420 nm the rate and magnitude of reduction of Fe4S4clusters in the presence of CO. Shown in Fig.2, nickel-treated H265V CODH (containing 2.4 nickel atoms per monomer) became 80% reduced by 3 h (Fig.2 B); full reduction was achieved at this point by adding dithionite (data not shown). This suggests that the majority of nickel-treated H265V CODH (at least 80%) binds to and is reduced by CO. Therefore, the low activity cannot be attributed to a very small quantity of active enzyme in a population consisting of mostly inactive enzyme. If this were true, one would expect that only a small fraction of the Fe4S4 centers would become reduced following exposure to CO, as is seen with the nickel-deficient forms of H265V (Fig. 2 A) and wild-type CODH (7Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As noted above, nickel-containing H265V CODH has at least 1000-fold lower catalytic activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. Both the forward (CO oxidation) and reverse (CO2 reduction) activities were decreased by similar factors (Table I) although the Km values for CO and methyl viologen for H265V CODH were not significantly different from those of the wild-type enzyme (Table II). With the exception of Vmax, the kinetic parameters of H265V CODH were very similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, we conclude that H265V CODH binds substrates with normal affinities but somehow lacks the ability to catalyze the oxidation of CO. The defect in activity does not appear to be in the ability to transfer electrons from center C to center B (or the reverse). If this were the case, one would expect that, upon treatment of the oxidized enzyme with CO, the Fe4S4 component of center C would become rapidly reduced followed by a very slow transfer of electrons to center B. This would be observed as an initially rapid decrease in A420 due to reduction of one Fe4S4 center (center C), followed by a very slow decrease in A420, reflecting the reduction of the second Fe4S4 center (center B). Based upon the data shown in Fig. 2, it appears that the defect occurs prior to or at the point of electron transfer to the Fe4S4 clusters of H265V CODH. The mechanism of CO oxidation may involve the attack of a hydroxyl on bound CO, and it was suggested to us by Dr. S. Ensign that the pH profiles of the wild-type CODH and H265V CODH might, therefore, differ dramatically. The pH profile of H265V CODH activity showed a nearly linear increase from 1.3 units/mg at pH 6.5 to 4.2 units/mg at pH 9.0, and the activity level reached a plateau of approximately 4.6 units/mg from pH 9.5 to 11 (data not shown). This is nearly identical to the effect of pH on the activity of wild-type CODH, and the two pH profiles are nearly superimposable (data not shown). The defect in CODH activity would not appear to be an inability to generate a hydroxyl group for attack on metal-bound CO, otherwise, a much greater increase in activity at higher pH would be expected for the H265V CODH. Cyanide is a slow, tight-binding, competitive inhibitor of wild-type CODH (8Ensign S.A. Hyman M.R. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4973-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Analysis of the inhibition of nickel-treated H265V CODH by cyanide in the absence or presence of CO yielded results similar to those previously reported for the wild-type enzyme (Table II). Both wild-type and H265V forms of the enzyme bind substrate and inhibitor with similar affinity; therefore, H265V CODH does not appear to suffer from any loss of binding affinity for substrate or substrate analog. The EPR spectrum of dithionite-reduced H265V CODH exhibits several overlappingS = ½ signals (Fig.3). The most prominent has g values of 2.04, 1.92, and 1.88 (gav = 1.94) and is characteristic of the [Fe4S4]+ form of center B (Bred) of wild-type CODH. Another signal having g values of 2.07, 1.92 and 1.88 (gav = 1.96) is evident (Fig.3 A), and this signal appeared to lose intensity with increasing nickel content (Fig. 3, B and C) and, therefore, was presumed to be due to a reduced version of center C in H265V CODH that lacked nickel. This signal did not shift significantly following the addition of cyanide (data not shown), which is what one would anticipate considering that cyanide is not expected to bind to the active site lacking nickel (8Ensign S.A. Hyman M.R. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4973-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Note that cyanide strongly perturbs the Cred1 (gav = 1.86) EPR signal (20Stephens P.J. McKenna M.-C. Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16347-16350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Anderson M.E. DeRose V.J. Hoffman B.M. Lindahl P.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12204-12205Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Following treatment with CO, nickel-treated H265V CODH has an EPR spectrum exhibiting only one S = ½ signal with g values of 2.04, 1.92, and 1.88 (gav = 1.94) which is characteristic of the Bred state (spectrum of nickel-treated H265V CODH shown in Fig.4 A). Notably absent in Fig.4 A is the gav = 1.87 signal characteristic of the three-electron-reduced form (25Anderson M.E. Lindahl P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8371-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) of center C, designated Cred2, which develops following reduction of wild-type CODH with CO. The gav = 1.94 signal shown in Fig. 4 Ahas a substoichiometric spin intensity of approximately 0.2 mol spin per mol of enzyme, which suggests incomplete reduction; however, this signal's intensity did not substantially increase when the incubation time under CO was doubled to 2 h. The relative intensity of the gav = 1.94 signal is more than 2-fold less in the spectrum of H265V CODH that contained 0.24 mol of nickel per mol of enzyme (data not shown). Possible evidence of an altered form of center C is found in the g = 4–6 region (Fig. 4 A), where sharp resonances appeared in spectra of as-purified and nickel-treated H265V CODH following exposure to CO. Adding cyanide to CO-treated enzyme led to a loss of these signals accompanied by shifting and broadening of peaks in the g = 2 region (Fig. 4 B). This observation tends to rule out center B as the paramagnetic center responsible for the gav = 1.94 signal in Fig.4 A. Adding cyanide before exposing nickel-containing samples of H265V CODH with CO completely prevented signal formation (data not shown). Signal formation was also not observed in EPR spectra of nickel-deficient H265V CODH that was incubated under 100% CO for 2 h (data not shown). This is consistent with the data in Fig. 2, which demonstrate that the Fe4S4 clusters of nickel-deficient H265V CODH do not undergo reduction in the presence of CO. All attempts also failed to produce the gav = 1.86 (Cred1) signal, which is characteristic of the 1-electron-reduced form of center C (designated Cred1) of wild-type CODH. Neither oxidation with the indigo carmine nor oxidative titration with thionine resulted in the formation of the Cred1 state in samples of H265V CODH that were initially reduced with sodium dithionite. During the thionine titration, the gav = 1.94 (Bred) and gav = 1.96 intensities diminished proportionally with increasing amounts of thionine added, and new signal formation was not observed at any point during the titration. The Cred1 and Cred2 spectroscopic states of center C of the wild-type CODH were previously explained by an electronic model describing an S = ½ [Fe4S4]+ cluster and anS = 1 Ni2+ site weakly coupled via the bridging ligand X (5Hu Z.G. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J.Q. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The Cred1 and Cred2spectroscopic states correlate with the presence of a unique iron subsite, designated ferrous component II (FCII) that is coordinated by five or six ligands in center C (5Hu Z.G. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J.Q. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The FCII subsite, however, is not observed in nickel-deficient CODH. In the absence of nickel, all iron atoms appear to be tetracoordinated and neither Cred1 nor Cred2 spectroscopic state is observed. In this study, the failure to observe th gav = 1.86 (Cred1) and gav = 1.87 (Cred2) EPR signals is consistent with our conclusion that the involvement of the nickel site with the chromophore electronic system of center C has been modified in H265V CODH. Our working hypothesis is that this modification affects and possibly prevents the formation of the penta or hexacoordinated FCII subsite when nickel is incorporated into center C. This is supported by the observation of unidentified, CO-dependent and cyanide-sensitive signals in spectrum of CO-reduced H265V CODH (Fig.4). Assuming that these signals are due to a paramagnetic oxidation state of center C, the low intensity of the gav = 1.94 signal combined with the appearance of signals in the g = 4–6 region (Fig. 4 A) suggests a spin-state equilibrium of S = ½ and S > ½ (3/2, 5/2, and so forth) states. Such a spin-state equilibrium has been invoked in previous studies of center C of wild-type CODH (5Hu Z.G. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J.Q. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem.

When purified from nickel-grown cultures, H265V CODH has a low nickel content that appears to result from a diminished capacity to incorporate nickel in vivo. When treated with either Co2+ or Ni2+ in vitro, the activity level of nickel-deficient H265V CODH increases, yet remains more than 1000-fold less active than does wild-type CODH. The kinetic data and slow rate of CO-dependent reduction of Fe4S4 clusters implicate a rate-limiting step that occurs prior to or at the point of electron transfer to the cubanes. The affinity of H265V CODH for substrates, however, is not diminished as a result of the substitution. The complete absence of gav = 1.86 (Cred1) and gav = 1.87 (Cred2) EPR signals suggest that the unique FCII subsite is not formed in the presence of nickel, perhaps as a consequence of the alteration of the ligand-mediated, electronic interaction between nickel and iron components of the center C of H265V CODH.

It encodes a 185-residue polypeptide that displays 56% identity with p19, a protein selectively expressed in the Golgi apparatus of neural cells (Sabéran-Djoneidi, D., Marey-Semper, I., Picart, R., Studler, J.-M., Tougard, C., Glowinski, J., and Lévi-Strauss, M.

We have previously described a 19-kDa murine protein (p19) selectively expressed in the Golgi apparatus of neural and neuroendocrine cells whose human corresponding gene has been localized in 5q35 (1Sabéran-Djoneidi D.

The primary sequence of p19 showed a 57% similarity with the translation product of an open reading frame of the rat neuronal p1A75 (3Sutcliffe J.G. Milner R.J. Shinnick T.M. Bloom F.E. Cell. 1983; 33: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) partial cDNA, which was isolated 14 years ago and whose human corresponding gene is localized in 4p16 (4Schuler G.D. et al.Science. 1996; 274: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Searches in protein data bases for other members of this new family have only revealed that these two proteins share a highly similar short segment with secretogranin III, which is expressed in intracellular vesicles of neural cells (1Sabéran-Djoneidi D.

Battenberg E.F. Tsou A.-P. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3135-3147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The co-localization, in two paralogous chromosomal regions (5q35 and 4p16), of the human p19 and p1A75 genes with other couples of homologous genes such as, for instance, the D1 and D5 dopamine receptors and the FGFR3 and FGFR4 fibroblast growth factor receptors suggested that these genes originated from the same large gene duplication event, which is thought to be the remnant of an ancient round of tetraploidization (6Lundin L.G. Genomics. 1993; 16: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To characterize this new protein family and to study the functional consequences of a well defined large duplication event, we undertook the thorough analysis of the protein encoded by the p1A75 cDNA. This encoded protein is a 21-kDa protein (p21) that is expressed, like p19, in the Golgi apparatus of neural and neuroendocrine cells. However, unlike p19, which is absent from the testis and faintly expressed in the olfactory epithelium, p21 is very strongly expressed in the olfactory epithelium and in male germ cells. Total cellular RNA was extracted from fresh tissue or cells by the guanidium thiocyanate/phenol chloroform extraction method (7Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62897) Google Scholar). Timed pregnant OFA rats (Iffa-Credo) provided a source of fetal and neonatal brains of precise gestational or postnatal ages. Other brain structures or non-neural tissues were dissected from adult Sprague-Dawley (Charles River) male rats. Dissociated neurons from cerebral hemispheres of embryonic day 17 rat embryos were plated at high density (6 × 104/cm2) according to Di Porzio et al. (8Di Porzio U. Daguet M.C. Glowinski J. Prochiantz A. Nature. 1980; 288: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and cultured for 2–4 days; astrocyte cultures were prepared from the same cerebral areas as described by Denis-Donini et al. (9Denis-Donini S. Glowinski J. Prochiantz A. Nature. 1984; 307: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA (5 μg/lane) was fractionated on 1.2% agarose gel containing 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde, using standard procedures (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gels were blotted onto Hybond N (Amersham Corp.) nylon membranes. The 18 and 28 S ribosomal RNAs observed on the filter by UV light were used to check that equal amounts of RNA were loaded on each lane. Hybridization conditions were as follows: 65 °C, 16 h in the presence of 2 106 cpm/ml of probe in the 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 0.4% SDS. Final washes were done in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Whole heads from 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were sectioned on a cryostat, and the sections (10–20 μm thick) were thaw-mounted on silanized glass slides, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and stocked at −20 °C until use. Frozen sections were thawed, fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Pronase, and again fixed with paraformaldehyde. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 42 °C using an oligodeoxynucleotide (CTCTGCAGCTTCGGTCTCCTGTTCCGACAGCTTCTCTTCTGA) labeled with [α-33P]dATP and terminal transferase according to Burgaya et al. (12Burgaya F. Menegon A. Menegoz M. Valtorta F. Girault J.-A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1810-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed in the presence of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled probe. Finally, sections were dehydrated and exposed to β-Max films (Amersham) for 1–3 weeks. The cDNA library was constructed in λgt10, as described previously (13Studler J.-M. Glowinski J. Lévi-Strauss M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), from poly(A)+ RNA prepared from cerebral hemispheres of newborn BALB/c mice. A p21 cDNA probe was amplified by nested RT-PCR from rat brain cDNA using the four following primers designed using the published p1A75 sequence (3Sutcliffe J.G. Milner R.J. Shinnick T.M. Bloom F.E. Cell. 1983; 33: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar): first PCR, AATCACTACAACCTGGCCAA and GGCTTTCTTCCTATCTAGCA; second PCR, ATCACGCGCTCAGTGTCA and ATCCTCGTGTTCTGCGCA. This cDNA, labeled by random priming (11Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar), was used as a probe to screen 2 × 105 cDNA clones. Among 104 positive clones, 15 were analyzed by Southern blot, and the insert of the largest one was subcloned in the pBluescript plasmid vector. Both strands of this cDNA (pBS64) were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination technique (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52240) Google Scholar) and the modified T7 polymerase (15Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar) using internal primers. The plasmid containing the p21 cDNA was amplified with Taq DNA polymerase (16Saiki R.K. Scharf S. Faloona F. Mullis K.B. Horn G.T. Erlich H.A. Arnheim N. Science. 1985; 230: 1350-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (6654) Google Scholar) using the two following primers: A (5′-TTCGGATCCATGGTGAAGTTGGGGAATTTC-3′) and B (5′-TAAGGATCCTGCCCGCTTGCTA-3′). These primers were designed to addBamHI restriction sites on both extremities of the p21 coding sequence. The amplified DNA fragment was restricted usingBamHI endonuclease and cloned in the BamHI site of the pQE-30 (Qiagen) expression vector, which produces a recombinant protein with a His6 tag on the N terminus. The construction was sequenced to verify the absence of mutations, and the synthesis of the recombinant protein was demonstrated by immunoblot using an antibody directed against a synthetic peptide (HYNLAKQSITRSVSPWMS) that corresponded to residues 149–166 of p21 and whose sequence was deduced from the rat cDNA (3Sutcliffe J.G. Milner R.J. Shinnick T.M. Bloom F.E. Cell. 1983; 33: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The recombinant p21 protein was produced and purified using nickel-chelate affinity chromatography (17Hochuli E. Döbeli H. Schacher A. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 411: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) in denaturing conditions according to the protocols provided by Qiagen. The recombinant protein (0.5 mg) solubilized in 8 m urea was loaded onto a 14% preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained in 0.25 m KCl, and the band corresponding to the p21 protein was cut and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized three times subcutaneously with a piece of gel containing approximately 100 μg of protein. Subcellular fractions were prepared from rat postnatal day 1 brain according to Huttner et al. (18Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. de Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Briefly, neonatal rat brains were homogenized in buffered sucrose (320 mm sucrose, 4 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) using a glass-Teflon homogenizer. This homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g; the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,200 × g to yield a pellet (P2) and a supernatant (S2). The S2 fraction was then centrifuged for 1 h at 165,000 × g to yield a pellet (P3) fraction and a cytosolic fraction (S3). Equivalent fractions of each preparation, corresponding to 100 μg of homogenate, were run on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) (19Towbin H. Gordon J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Carbonate extractability was tested on the P2 fraction as described previously (20Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Briefly, pellets were resuspended in a large volume of ice-cold 100 mm Na2CO3 buffer, pH 11.5 (or phosphate-buffered saline for the control experiment), incubated for 1 h on ice, and centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 ×g. After saturation with 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of the rabbit serum followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to peroxidase. Enzymatic activity was revealed using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham). Dissociated neurons from cerebral hemispheres of embryonic day 17 rat embryos were plated in 35-mm culture dishes at high density (6 × 104/cm2) in serum-free medium according to Di Porzio et al. (8Di Porzio U. Daguet M.C. Glowinski J. Prochiantz A. Nature. 1980; 288: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and cultured for 8 days. Neurons were seeded on glass coverslips and fixed with periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde (21McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar) for 2 h at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.005% saponin, and immunocytochemically stained using the rabbit anti p21 antiserum or preimmune serum diluted 1:500 and then goat immunoglobulins (IgG) against rabbit IgG labeled with tetramethylrhodamine (Biosys, Compiègne, France). For transient transfection experiments, theBamHI-BamHI restriction fragment used for prokaryotic expression in the vector pQE-30 (see above) was excised and inserted in the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen). Transfections of COS-7 cells with this construction were performed on polyornithine-treated glass coverslips using the DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim) protocol and reagents. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with anti-p21 antiserum followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with fluorescein (Biosys). Immunocytochemistry was performed on mouse testis prints and isolated germ cells obtained by seminiferous tubule dilaceration. Prints and cells were fixed for 15 min with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% sucrose, treated for 5 min with Triton X-100, and incubated for 1 h in 5% fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell preparations were incubated for 40 min with preimmune serum or anti-p21 antiserum diluted 1:750 and immunolabeled using biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulins and streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complexes (Amersham). Enzymatic activity was revealed using aminoethyl carbazole as a chromogen, and the cell preparations were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin and mounted in aqueous medium (Glycergel, Dakopatts). Stages of mouse spermatogenesis were identified according to Russellet al. (22Russell L.D. Ettlin R.A. Sinha Hikim A.P. Clegg E.D. Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990: 120-161Google Scholar). The immunoperoxidase procedure was performed on dissociated neurons using a preembedding approach, in situ in the Petri dishes, as described previously (23Tougard C. Picart R. Am. J. Anat. 1986; 175: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde (as described above) and permeabilized with 0.005% saponin before incubation with the rabbit anti-p21 antiserum and then with sheep IgG against rabbit IgG labeled with peroxidase (Institut Pasteur, Paris). After postfixation in 1% glutaraldehyde, detection of peroxidase activity, and postfixation in 1% osmium tetroxide, cells were embedded in situ in Epon according to Brinkley et al. (24Brinkley B.R. Murphy P. Richardson L.C. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 35: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). After observation at the light microscopic level, selected areas of immunoreactive cells were sectioned, and ultrathin sections were examined under the electron microscope without further staining. Since the previously described, 1126-base pair-long p1A75 cDNA (3Sutcliffe J.G. Milner R.J. Shinnick T.M. Bloom F.E. Cell. 1983; 33: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) is shorter than the 1700-base-long mRNA on which it hybridizes on a Northern blot (3Sutcliffe J.G. Milner R.J. Shinnick T.M. Bloom F.E. Cell. 1983; 33: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we decided to isolate a full-length cDNA. To this end, our newborn mouse (BALB/c) brain cDNA library (13Studler J.-M. Glowinski J. Lévi-Strauss M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) constructed in the λgt10 phage vector was screened with a probe synthesized by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from rat brain cDNA and corresponding to nucleotides 136–881 of the p1A75 cDNA (3Sutcliffe J.G. Milner R.J. Shinnick T.M. Bloom F.E. Cell. 1983; 33: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Among 15 positive clones analyzed by Southern blot, the clone pBS64 had the largest cDNA insert. Its length (2083 bases without the poly(A) tract) corresponded to our estimation of the size of the rat mRNA whose migration was slightly faster than that of the 18 S rRNA (see below). The cDNA terminates by a poly(A) tract preceded by a typical polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) at position 2062 (Fig.1 A). The longest open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 185 residues with a predicted molecular mass of 21 kDa. This open reading frame is initiated by the first ATG (position 53) surrounded by a sequence matching very well the proposed consensus for the initiation of translation (25Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar) (consensus, CC(A/G)CCATGG; p21cDNA, CAACCATGG). Comparison of the complete sequence of this polypeptide with that of p19 (1Sabéran-Djoneidi D. Marey-Semper I. Picart R. Studler J.-M. Tougard C. Glowinski J. Lévi-Strauss M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1888-1893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) confirmed their highly significant similarity (Fig.1 B). If one excepts an insertion of 12 residues in p21 (residues 74–85) (16 for p19 and 19 for p21), these two polypeptides display 56% identity (96 of 171 identical residues) (Fig. 1 B). Study of hydropathy of this polypeptide by the method of Kyte and Doolittle (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16890) Google Scholar) indicated that it is moderately hydrophilic with the exception of two adjoining stretches, being, respectively, strongly hydrophilic (residues 47–68) or hydrophobic (residues 83–103) (Fig.2). The N terminus of the polypeptide does not fit the outline proposed for signal sequences (27von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3684) Google Scholar). The p21 mRNA was further characterized by Northern blot analysis (Fig.3, A and B) and in situ hybridization (Fig.4). The p21 cDNA probe recognized an apparently unique mRNA with a migration rate slightly faster than the 18 S ribosomal RNA (Fig. 3 A). Its pattern of hybridization to RNAs from a variety of rat tissues revealed an absence of expression in liver, spleen, kidney, and heart and a strong but variable signal in all brain and spinal cord samples tested (Fig.3 A). The p21 mRNA was also strongly expressed in the pituitary, in a crude preparation of the olfactory epithelium, and, to a lesser extent, in the adrenal gland and in the testis (Fig.3 A). Comparison of the p21 hybridization signal in RNA samples extracted from cultured astrocytes or neurons suggested a neuronal origin for this RNA, which was absent from the astrocyte culture (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 3 B, the p21 mRNA was present as early as embryonic day 14 in cerebral hemispheres, where its expression increased during embryogenesis. The maximal abundance of this mRNA was found around embryonic day 20, and its expression faded afterward to reach adult levels at P15 (Fig.3 B).Figure 4In situ hybridization to p21 mRNA. Horizontal section of a 3-day-old rat head. Note the labeling of the olfactory epithelium and of the retinas.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since the olfactory epithelium RNA sample was extracted from a crude homogenate of the inside of nasal cavities, attempts were made to further demonstrate that the marked p21 mRNA expression occurred indeed in the epithelium. We therefore performed an in situhybridization experiment on a postnatal day 3 horizontal section of a rat head. As expected, an intense labeling was observed in the olfactory epithelium (Fig. 4). Moreover, the brain area and the retinas were clearly labeled. Western blot analysis of p21 expression using rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant p21 showed the existence of a single band in the brain of the postnatal day 1 rat (Fig. 5 A). The migration level (21 kDa) of the corresponding protein corresponded exactly to the calculated molecular mass of p21. p21 was absent from the soluble cytosolic fraction and was found at comparable levels in the postnuclear pellet (P2) and the supernatant (S2), in which it was fully associated with the pellet (P3) obtained after ultracentrifugation (Fig. 5 A). A carbonate treatment, which allows discrimination between integral and peripheral membrane proteins (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16890) Google Scholar), was also performed on the P2 fraction (Fig. 5 B). Fig.5 B shows that p21 is not released from the P2 fraction following carbonate treatment. Control experiments, performed with an anti-synapsin antibody indicated that this peripheral protein is, as expected, completely extracted from the P2 pellet by the carbonate treatment (Fig. 5 B). In primary neuronal cultures from the embryonic striatum and cerebral cortex, the anti p21 antiserum labeled a prominent juxtanuclear Golgi-like area in the majority of neurons (Fig. 6). In contrast, the few contaminating glial cells were devoid of immunolabeling (not shown). Analysis of the same preparation by immunoelectron microscopy showed a specific labeling of all the saccules and of some vesicles in the Golgi zone (Fig.7 A). The perinuclear cistern was also labeled (Fig. 7 C) as well as some dispersed small vacuolar structures and multivesicular bodies in the cell body or in neurites (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7Ultrastructural localization of p21 in cultured neurons. A, the stack of Golgi saccules is labeled as well as a small vesicle (arrowhead) in the Golgi zone (G). B, two labeled multivesicular bodies.C, a conspicuous labeling of the perinuclear cisterna.Bars, 0.5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) An immunocytochemical analysis of testis prints and isolated germ cells was performed to identify, within this highly heterogenous tissue, the p21-expressing cell type. Fig.8 A shows a labeling of the Golgi complex of primary spermatocytes as early as the pachytene stage. The Golgi complex was found to be stained at all the subsequent stages of meiosis (data not shown). In mature spermatids, both the whole acrosomal region and the flagellar middle piece were labeled (Fig.8 C). At this latter level, the staining was localized in the flagellar layer surrounding the axial structures (i.e.axoneme and dense fibers) with a periodical transversal pattern related to the mitochondrial sheath. No staining of the spermatocytes and spermatids was observed with the preimmune serum at the same dilution (Fig. 8, B and D). Immunocytochemical analysis of transfected COS cells expressing the p21 cDNA revealed a conspicuous immunolabeling of a juxtanuclear zone (Fig. 9). No specific immunoreactivity was detected in wild-type COS cells (data not shown). In this study, we have characterized the product of the p1A75 cDNA (3Sutcliffe J.G. Milner R.J. Shinnick T.M. Bloom F.E. Cell. 1983; 33: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which belongs to the same new family as the p19 protein (1Sabéran-Djoneidi D. Marey-Semper I. Picart R. Studler J.-M. Tougard C. Glowinski J. Lévi-Strauss M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1888-1893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This 21-kDa protein (p21) is, like p19, expressed in the Golgi apparatus of neural cells. However, in contrast to p19, which is absent from the testis and faintly expressed in the olfactory epithelium, p21 is very strongly expressed in the olfactory epithelium and in male gametes at the late stages of their differentiation. The similarity (56% identity) of the primary sequences of murine p19 and p21 indicates that these proteins belong to the same family. The main differences between these two proteins consist in the presence of a 12-amino acid-long insertion (TEGVTERFKVSV) in the p21 sequence and in a complete divergence of their 15 most carboxyl-terminal residues. Searches in data banks for related sequences yielded a wealth of overlapping human expressed sequence tags that exhibit a very high similarity level with either of the two murine sequences. These overlapping expressed sequence tags allowed the reconstruction of the primary sequence of human p19 and p21 (data not shown). The very high similarity of the murine and human p19 and p21 sequences (respectively, 95 and 98% identity for p19 and p21) suggests that these proteins are submitted to a strong selection pressure. In addition to these expressed sequence tags, searches in protein data bases revealed that the highly similar short segment that is shared by p19, p21, and secretogranin III (5Ottiger H.-P. Battenberg E.F. Tsou A.-P. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3135-3147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is also found in a subset of highly related members of the yeast ABC protein family (28Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) (Fig.10). Western blot experiments performed with an antiserum made against the recombinant protein indicated the existence of a single band in the brain of the postnatal day 1 rat whose migration rate (21 kDa) corresponded to the calculated molecular mass of p21 (Fig.5 A). This molecular mass differs from the one (25 or 28 kDa) determined by Sutcliffe et al. (3Sutcliffe J.G. Milner R.J. Shinnick T.M. Bloom F.E. Cell. 1983; 33: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) for the same polypeptide using hybridization translation or immunoprecipitation experiments, respectively. This difference is probably due to a lack of accuracy in the determination of the molecular mass rather than to the recognition of another protein by the antipeptide antiserum used by these authors. Indeed, the organelle-like pattern observed in their immunocytochemistry experiments corresponds very well to the Golgi apparatus localization of p21 (3Sutcliffe J.G. Milner R.J. Shinnick T.M. Bloom F.E. Cell. 1983; 33: 671-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This subcellular localization of p21 is closely similar to that of p19. Indeed, similar patterns of localization were found for these two proteins using either immunoelectron microscopy or immunofluorescence analysis. The Golgi-like localization of transfected p21 in COS cells (Fig. 9) indicated that, like p19 (1Sabéran-Djoneidi D. Marey-Semper I. Picart R. Studler J.-M. Tougard C. Glowinski J. Lévi-Strauss M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1888-1893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), its primary sequence contains a Golgi targeting signal. Moreover, the presence, in p21 and p19, of a highly hydrophobic segment and their carbonate-resistant membrane association indicated that they are both integral membrane proteins. The absence of a signal peptide in the p21 sequence suggests that, like p19, this protein could be inserted in the membrane by a C-terminal anchor (1Sabéran-Djoneidi D. Marey-Semper I. Picart R.

Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The main difference between p19 and p21 seems to reside in their tissular pattern of expression. p21 mRNA is indeed prominently produced in the olfactory epithelium and to a lesser extent in testis, two tissues in which p19 expression is, respectively, weak and undetectable (1Sabéran-Djoneidi D. Marey-Semper I. Picart R. Studler J.-M. Tougard C. Glowinski J. Lévi-Strauss M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1888-1893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The high expression of p21 in cultured neurons and in neural and neuroendocrine tissues, on the one hand, and its absence from all other organs except testis, on the other hand, strongly suggest a neuronal localization of p21 within the olfactory epithelium. Very likely, the extremely high hybridization signal observed for p21 mRNA in Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 A) of a crude olfactory epithelium preparation (which also contains supporting tissues) probably underestimates the real concentration of p21 mRNA in the epithelium. Immunohistochemistry experiments (Fig. 8) indicated that, within the testis, p21 is expressed, as expected, in the Golgi complex of primary spermatocytes and in the acrosomal region of mature spermatids. More surprisingly, p21 is also expressed in the flagellar middle piece of late spermatids, which contains the mitochondrial sheath. This surprising localization of a protein in olfactory neurons and in germinal cells of the testis, two apparently unrelated cell types, has already been described in the case of a subset of odorant receptors and their transducing proteins (30Parmentier M. Libert F. Schurmans S. Schiffmann S. Lefort A. Eggerickx D. Ledent C. Mollereau C. Gérard C. Perret J. Grootegoed A. Vassort G.

Med. 1995; 1: 130-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins, which are mainly located in the flagellar middle piece of sperm cells, could be responsible for the marked augmentation of the respiratory activity that is associated with chemotaxis (32Walensky L.D. Roskams A.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Snyder S.H. Ronnett G.V. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 130-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of p21 in the tail middle piece of sperm cells suggests that this protein could also be involved in this process, reinforcing therefore the hypothesis of a resemblance, at the molecular level, between olfaction and germ cell chemotaxis. In addition, the presence of p21 in the acrosomal region, which originates from Golgi vesicles, can also be related to sperm chemoattraction. Cohen-Dayag et al. (33Cohen-Dayag A. Tur-Kaspa I. Dor J. Mashiach S. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11039-11043Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have indeed shown that the potential to undergo the acrosome reaction (sperm capacitation) is correlated with sperm chemotactic activity. Future studies will be necessary to investigate the role of p21 in olfactory neurons and in sperm cells. In addition to their interest for the biology of these two cell types, these studies should also help to understand the functional consequences of a large gene duplication event, which, in addition to p19 and p21, gave rise to numerous other couples of genes located, in the human genome, on the telomeric ends of the long arms of chromosomes 4 and 5 (6Lundin L.G. Genomics. 1993; 16: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as seems to be the case for p19 and p21, the other couples of genes suspected to originate from this large gene duplication event differ mostly by their tissular pattern of expression. For instance, the dopamine receptors D1 and D5 (34Sunahara R.K. Guan H.-C. O'Dowd B.F. Seeman P. Laurier L.G. Ng G. George S.R. Torchia J. Van Tol H.H.M. Niznik H.B.

https://openalex.org/W2128205179,"The two closely related vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) 1 and 2 differ substantially in ligand recognition. The neuronal VMAT2 exhibits a higher affinity for monoamine substrates and in particular for histamine as well as a greater sensitivity to the inhibitor tetrabenazine than the nonneuronal VMAT1. The analysis of chimeric transport proteins has previously shown that two major domains, one spanning transmembrane domains (TMDs) 5–8 (TMD5–8) and the other, TMDs 9–12 (TMD9–12), are required for the high affinity interactions characteristic of VMAT2. Using site-directed mutagenesis to replace residues in TMD5–8 of VMAT2 with the equivalent residues from VMAT1, we now show that the sensitivity of VMAT2 to tetrabenazine requires Ala-315, and this interaction occurs independently of the interaction with residues in TMD9–12. The ability to recognize histamine as a substrate depends on Pro-237, and the contribution of TMD9–12 to histamine recognition appears to involve a common mechanism. In contrast, the replacement of many residues in TMD5–8 of VMAT2 with equivalent residues from VMAT1 improves the recognition of both serotonin and tryptamine, and these mutations show a dominant effect on the recognition of both tryptamine and serotonin over mutations in TMD9–12. The results indicate that different ligands interact through distinct mechanisms with the VMATs and that the recognition of each ligand involves multiple, independent interactions with the transport protein.

Neurotransmitters are packaged into secretory vesicles so that their release can be regulated by exocytosis. In the case of monoamine transmitters, two closely related vesicular transport proteins have been identified (VMAT1 and VMAT2) 1The abbreviations used are: VMAT, vesicular monoamine transporter; TMD, transmembrane domains.1The abbreviations used are: VMAT, vesicular monoamine transporter; TMD, transmembrane domains.

Hoffman B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10993-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). VMAT1 is expressed in adrenal medulla and other nonneuronal cells, whereas VMAT2 appears in multiple monoamine populations of brain as well as sympathetic neurons, mast cells, and histamine-containing cells in the gut (3Peter D. Liu Y. Sternini C. de Giorgio R. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6179-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 4Weihe E. Schafer M.K. Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition to their differences in distribution, the two VMATs differ in ligand recognition and pharmacology. VMAT2 has a higher apparent affinity for dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin than VMAT1 (5Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Erickson J.D. Schafer M.K.-H. Bonner T.I. Eiden L.E. Weihe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5166-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Furthermore, VMAT2 transports histamine, whereas VMAT1 does not, presumably accounting for the expression of VMAT2 but not VMAT1 in histamine-containing cells of the gut as well as in mast cells (7Merickel A. Edwards R.H. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1543-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). VMAT2 also shows 10-fold greater sensitivity to the classical inhibitor tetrabenazine than VMAT1 (5Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Erickson J.D. Schafer M.K.-H. Bonner T.I. Eiden L.E. Weihe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5166-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The existence of two closely related proteins that differ substantially in their substrate affinity and pharmacology provides an opportunity to dissect the structural basis for these differences. To identify domains responsible for these differences, we first expressed and analyzed a series of chimeric transport proteins (8Peter D. Vu T. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2979-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These chimeras retained function, and analysis showed that two major regions from VMAT2, one extending from transmembrane domain (TMD) 5 to the beginning of TMD8 (TMD5–8) and the other from the end of TMD9 through TMD12 (TMD9–12), are apparently both required for the high affinity interactions characteristic of VMAT2 (8Peter D. Vu T. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2979-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Replacement of individual VMAT2 residues from either region with corresponding VMAT1 residues may therefore reduce the affinity of VMAT2 interactions to those characteristic of VMAT1, whereas multiple replacements in both TMD5–8 and TMD9–12 of VMAT1 would be required to increase the affinity of the interactions toward that of VMAT2. Focusing first on TMD9–12, we introduced mutations that convert the VMAT2 sequence into VMAT1 and found that many residues in this region have no effect on recognition (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, substitution of Tyr-434 with Phe (mutant Y434F) and Asp-461 with Asn (D461N) significantly reduced the affinity of VMAT2 for tetrabenazine, histamine, and serotonin. Replacement of Lys-446 with Gln (K446Q) reduced the affinity of VMAT2 for tetrabenazine and serotonin but not histamine, whereas substitution of Phe-464 with Tyr (F464Y) reduced serotonin affinity but not tetrabenazine or histamine recognition. The analysis of multiple mutants indicated that Tyr-434 and Asp-461 account for essentially all of the difference in histamine recognition between the two VMATs attributable to TMD9–12. In addition, Tyr-434, Lys-446, and Asp-461 account for essentially all of the differences in serotonin and tetrabenazine recognition attributable to this region. To identify the features of the ligand recognized by these residues, we also examined the interaction of these mutants with structurally related compounds. In contrast to other ligands recognized with higher affinity by VMAT2 than VMAT1, tryptamine inhibits transport of [3H]serotonin by VMAT1 much more potently than VMAT2 (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Replacement of Tyr-434 with Phe (Y434F) alone increases the affinity of VMAT2 for tryptamine to that of VMAT1 (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the same residue that contributes to the high affinity interactions of VMAT2 with tetrabenazine, histamine, and serotonin accounts for the lower affinity interaction of VMAT2 with tryptamine, suggesting that this residue discriminates between serotonin and tryptamine. The analysis of chimeras has suggested that TMD5–8 is required along with TMD9–12 for most of the high affinity interactions characteristic of VMAT2. In the present study, we have substituted amino acids in TMD5–8 of VMAT2 with the equivalent residues from VMAT1. Functional analysis of these mutants implicates specific residues in the interaction of VMAT2 with serotonin, histamine, tetrabenazine, and tryptamine. The comparison of single and multiple mutants also indicates that these residues interact differently with the ligands from residues in TMD9–12. Mutations were introduced into wild-type VMAT2 using single-stranded, uracil-containing DNA as described previously (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). VMAT2 double, triple, and quadruple mutant combinations were produced through the sequential subcloning of single mutants. In contrast, VMAT1 triple and quadruple mutants were each produced in a single reaction containing multiple mutagenic oligonucleotide primers. In all cases, a restriction fragment containing the desired mutation(s) was sequenced in its entirety by the dideoxy method both to confirm the desired mutation and to exclude unwanted mutations (11Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52624) Google Scholar). After sequence analysis, the fragments were subcloned back into appropriate wild-type cDNAs. Plasmid DNA was prepared, COS1 cells were transfected, and membranes were isolated for analysis as described previously (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in cold 0.32m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4 (SH buffer) containing 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml E-64, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Cells are then lysed by sonication, and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. The transport assay was performed as described previously (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, a frozen aliquot of membranes was thawed on ice, and 10 μl (50–100 μg of protein) was added to 200 μl of SH buffer at 29 °C containing 4 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm ATP, and either 20 nm [1,2-3H]serotonin (NEN Life Science Products), 20 nm [2,5,6-3H]dopamine (NEN Life Science Products ), or 29 nm[2,5-3H]histamine (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). To determine the Km for dopamine and serotonin, a range of nonradioactive substrate concentrations was added to the reaction solution, and transport was measured after incubation for 1 min at 29 °C. To determine the concentration of compounds needed to inhibit serotonin transport by 50% (IC50), increasing concentrations of tetrabenazine (Fluka), histamine (Sigma), and tryptamine (Sigma) were added to the reaction solution. After incubation for 1 min at 29 °C, the transport reaction was terminated by rapid dilution with 3 ml of cold SH buffer and filtration through 0.2-μm Supor 200 membranes (Gelman Instrument Co.). The filters were then dried, and the bound radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting in Cytoscint (ICN). For each mutant, transport activity was measured in duplicate on a total of three separate occasions using membranes prepared from three separate transfections. The protein concentration of each membrane sample was measured using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the unpaired two-tailed t test was used for all statistical comparisons. The analysis of chimeric transporters has suggested that replacing individual residues in VMAT2 with the equivalent residues from VMAT1 may suffice to reduce the affinity with which VMAT2 interacts with multiple ligands (8Peter D. Vu T. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2979-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Indeed, TMD9–12 of VMAT2 contains several residues that when replaced with the equivalent residues from VMAT1 reduce the high affinity of VMAT2 interactions toward those of VMAT1 (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have extended the analysis to TMD5–8 in VMAT2. Of 27 residues in TMD5–8 that differ between the two VMATs, we focused on 18 that show nonconservative differences (Fig.1). The majority of VMAT1 substitutions introduced into TMD5–8 of VMAT2 do not influence the sensitivity to tetrabenazine as measured by the IC50 for inhibition of [3H]serotonin transport (TableI). However, replacement of Ala-315 from VMAT2 with Thr from VMAT1 (A315T) significantly reduces tetrabenazine sensitivity. The addition of A315T to the triple mutant Y434F/K446Q/D461N previously shown to account for all of the reduced tetrabenazine sensitivity attributable to TMD9–12 (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) further reduces tetrabenazine sensitivity to a level similar to that of wild-type VMAT1 (Table II). Taken together with the previous results (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), Ala-315, Tyr-434, Lys-446, and Asp-461 thus each contribute independently to the high affinity recognition of tetrabenazine by VMAT2 (Fig. 2). These residues may interact directly with tetrabenazine, but they may also affect ligand recognition indirectly through changes in protein conformation.Table IIndividual residues in TMD5–8 influence the recognition of tetrabenazine, histamine, and serotonin by VMATsTetrabenazine (IC50)Histamine (IC50)Serotonin (Km)μmμmμmVMAT14.27 ± 0.721-ap < 0.01.305 ± 921-ap < 0.01.0.47 ± 0.17 1-bp < 0.05.VMAT20.52 ± 0.2133 ± 140.27 ± 0.04M231L0.50 ± 0.1728 ± 70.14 ± 0.02 1-ap < 0.01.P237A0.38 ± 0.05174 ± 44 1-ap < 0.01.0.06 ± 0.01 1-ap < 0.01.L243M0.66 ± 0.0321 ± 10.13 ± 0.02 1-ap < 0.01.A251S0.53 ± 0.1122 ± 20.13 ± 0.02 1-ap < 0.01.A258F0.38 ± 0.0923 ± 20.13 ± 0.01 1-ap < 0.01.F269C0.55 ± 0.1628 ± 100.16 ± 0.01 1-ap < 0.01.Q272W0.73 ± 0.1919 ± 20.16 ± 0.03 1-ap < 0.01.Q277S0.59 ± 0.1327 ± 70.12 ± 0.03 1-ap < 0.01.Q281A0.69 ± 0.1820 ± 30.12 ± 0.01 1-ap < 0.01.K282M0.46 ± 0.1426 ± 40.17 ± 0.02 1-ap < 0.01.P285S0.51 ± 0.0719 ± 20.14 ± 0.02 1-ap < 0.01.T287L0.54 ± 0.1627 ± 60.16 ± 0.02 1-ap < 0.01.F304L0.32 ± 0.1128 ± 70.11 ± 0.02 1-ap < 0.01.M311I0.53 ± 0.1920 ± 20.11 ± 0.04 1-ap < 0.01.A315T1.00 ± 0.421-bp < 0.05.21 ± 30.10 ± 0.03 1-ap < 0.01.E322Q0.74 ± 0.2116 ± 20.16 ± 0.04 1-ap < 0.01.R327P0.46 ± 0.0922 ± 20.12 ± 0.02 1-ap < 0.01.K328E0.53 ± 0.1720 ± 30.21 ± 0.01 1-bp < 0.05.1-a p < 0.01.1-b p < 0.05.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether specific residues from TMD5–8 of VMAT2 contribute to the high affinity recognition of histamine, we measured the effect of VMAT1 substitutions in this region on the ability of histamine to inhibit [3H]serotonin transport. Similar to the analysis of tetrabenazine sensitivity, most of these mutations, including A315T which influences tetrabenazine sensitivity, do not affect histamine recognition. However, the substitution of Pro-237 from VMAT2 with Ala from VMAT1 (P237A) significantly reduces histamine recognition (Table I). Thus, different residues in TMD5–8 account for the differences between the two VMATs in tetrabenazine sensitivity and histamine recognition, consistent with previous results from the analysis of mutants in TMD9–12 that also suggest distinct recognition sites (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, the involvement of a proline in histamine recognition suggests an indirect effect of this residue on protein structure rather than a direct interaction with the ligand. Since Tyr-434 and Asp-461 were the only residues in TMD9–12 of VMAT2 previously found to influence histamine recognition (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we combined the P237A mutation from TMD5–8 with Y434F and D461N (Table II). Analysis of this triple mutant (P237A/Y434F/D461N) showed that the combination of mutations still does not suffice to completely convert the histamine recognition of VMAT2 into that of VMAT1. Thus, other residues in VMAT2 may also contribute to the high affinity recognition of histamine. Further, P237A/Y434F/D461N has an IC50 for histamine identical to that of either P237A or Y434F/D461N alone (TableII), indicating that these residues do not function independently and hence contribute to a single site of interaction with histamine (Fig.2). As a control for these multiple mutations, we also combined K328E in TMD5–8, which alone has no effect on histamine recognition, with the Y434F/K446Q/D461N triple mutation in TMD9–12 previously shown to reduce histamine recognition (K328E/Y434F/K446Q/D461N). Surprisingly, this combination restores the affinity of the triple mutant to that of wild-type VMAT2, suggesting that the regions spanning TMD5–8 and TMD9–12 interact to confer high affinity histamine recognition. The recognition of serotonin by VMAT2 appears more complex than the recognition of tetrabenazine and histamine. The analysis of chimeras has shown that TMD9–12 of VMAT1 reduces serotonin affinity when introduced into VMAT2; however, TMD5–8 of VMAT1 increases serotonin affinity in the context of C-terminal VMAT1 sequences (8Peter D. Vu T. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2979-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, although TMD5–8 of VMAT1 reduces the affinity of VMAT2 for tetrabenazine and histamine, this same region reverses the loss of affinity for serotonin produced by TMD9–12 from VMAT1. To determine whether the same residues in TMD5–8 of VMAT1 responsible for low affinity interactions with tetrabenazine and histamine contribute to the high affinity for serotonin, we analyzed the VMAT1 substitutions into VMAT2 described above. Surprisingly, many of the VMAT1 substitutions into TMD5–8 of VMAT2, including mutations A315T and P237A that, respectively, impair tetrabenazine and histamine recognition, increase apparent affinity for serotonin (Table I). The analysis of chimeras suggested that TMD5–8 of VMAT1 has a dominant effect on serotonin recognition over TMD9–12 from VMAT1 (8Peter D. Vu T. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2979-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether specific residues in this region also have a dominant effect, we have focused on mutation A315T (because it influences tetrabenazine and serotonin recognition), P237A (because it influences histamine and serotonin recognition), and K328E (because it does not substantially influence any of these interactions). The introduction of A315T into Y434F/K446Q/D461N (A315T/Y434F/K446Q/ D461N) and P237A into Y434F/D461N (P237A/Y434F/D461N), both, increase the apparent affinity for serotonin (Table II). Interestingly, the K328E mutation that does not alone substantially affect serotonin recognition does increase the apparent affinity for serotonin when combined with Y434F/K446Q/D461N (K328E/Y434F/K446Q/D461N) and with F464Y (K328E/F464Y) (Table II). Taken together, these results indicate that residues from TMD5–8 of VMAT1 have a dominant effect on serotonin affinity over VMAT1 residues from TMD9–12. In addition, theVmax for serotonin transport by all the individual and multiple mutants is equivalent to that of the wild-type VMATs (100–200 pmol/min/mg; data not shown), suggesting comparable levels of expression and turnover. Importantly, the combination of P237A with A440T, a mutation from TMD9–12 that increases serotonin affinity, further enhances serotonin recognition to produce a transport protein with an apparent affinity for serotonin (Km ∼ 40 nm) seven times greater than that of wild-type VMAT2 (Km ∼ 270 nm), suggesting that the two residues independently contribute to substrate recognition (Fig. 2). However, the ability of multiple residues in TMD5–8 of VMAT1 to increase substrate recognition makes it more likely that these substitutions act indirectly through changes in protein conformation rather than through direct interactions with the ligand. Previous analysis of residues in TMD9–12 has shown that the replacement of Tyr-434 in VMAT2 with Phe from VMAT1 increases the recognition of tryptamine, and this single residue accounts for all of the difference in tryptamine recognition between the two VMATs (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since Pro-237 and Tyr-434 both contribute to histamine recognition, we considered that Pro-237 may also influence tryptamine recognition. Indeed, like Y434F, mutation P237A completely converts VMAT2 into VMAT1 with respect to the recognition of tryptamine (Table III). Since P237A increases the apparent affinity for serotonin and tryptamine differs from serotonin only in the absence of the 5-hydroxyl group, alanine at position 237 appears to promote the recognition of some feature in common between these two ligands. Other residues that increase apparent affinity for serotonin may therefore also promote tryptamine recognition. Indeed, the A315T mutation significantly increases tryptamine as well as serotonin recognition. Furthermore, if these substitutions recognize a feature common to both serotonin and tryptamine and Tyr-434 recognizes the 5-hydroxyl group present on serotonin but absent from tryptamine as suggested in previous studies (9Finn J.P. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16301-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), then the combination of either P237A or A315T with Y434F should further increase tryptamine recognition. Indeed, the recognition of tryptamine by triple mutant P237A/Y434F/D461N (IC50, 71 nm) significantly exceeds that of P237A (IC50, 470 nm) and Y434F (IC50, 350 nm) alone (p < 0.01). Triple mutant A315T/Y434F/K446Q/D461N also recognizes tryptamine with higher affinity than A315T and Y434F alone (p < 0.05). Thus, VMAT1 residues in TMD5–8 interact with a feature of the indoleamine ligand distinct from that recognized by the phenylalanine residue in TMD11 of VMAT1. Conversely, Pro-237 of VMAT2 appears to hinder the interaction with a feature of the ligand common to both serotonin and tryptamine, whereas Tyr-434 hinders the recognition of tryptamine but not serotonin. Tyr-434 presumably interacts with the hydroxyl group on serotonin and the residues in TMD5–8 with some other feature common to tryptamine and serotonin (Fig. 2).Table IIIMultiple residues influence the recognition of tryptamine by VMATsTryptamine (IC50)μmVMAT13-adata from Finn et al.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether the residues required for the high affinity interactions characteristic of VMAT2 also suffice to confer high affinity, we introduced these residues from VMAT2 into the equivalent positions of VMAT1. We first constructed the triple mutant F434Y/Q446K/N461D that contains three major residues from TMD9–12 of VMAT2. (For convenience, the numbers refer to the VMAT2 sequence). In addition, we constructed a quadruple VMAT1 mutant (A237P/F434Y/Q446K/N461D) that includes Pro-237 from TMD5–8 of VMAT2, since this residue influences histamine, serotonin, and tryptamine recognition. Analysis of these triple and quadruple mutants shows that these replacements do not confer high affinity interactions with tetrabenazine, histamine, or serotonin (TableIV). Indeed, both VMAT1 mutants recognize these ligands very poorly, suggesting that, rather than simply failing to restore the VMAT2 phenotype, the mutations have interfered with some aspect of protein structure. Further, neither VMAT1 mutant transports [3H]histamine, and the apparent affinity of these mutants for dopamine is also greatly reduced (data not shown), suggesting a general defect in ligand recognition. Nonetheless, the mutant A237P/F434Y/Q446K/N461D, which contains the A237P substitution from VMAT2, has a lower affinity for serotonin than the F434Y/Q446K/N461D mutant, which lacks A237P (Table IV), supporting a dominant role for TMD5–8 of VMAT1 in substrate recognition. In addition, A237P/F434Y/Q446K/N461D recognizes tryptamine very poorly, whereas the recognition of tryptamine by F434Y/Q446K/N461D resembles wild-type VMAT2 (Table III), consistent with a role for residues in TMD5–8 and specifically, the alanine (in TMD5) in tryptamine recognition.Table IVVMAT2 substitutions into VMAT1 do not confer high affinity ligand recognitionTetrabenazine (IC50)Histamine (IC50)Serotonin (Km)μmμmμmVMAT14.27 ± 0.724-ap < 0.01.305 ± 924-ap < 0.01.0.47 ± 0.174-bp < 0.05.VMAT20.52 ± 0.2133 ± 140.27 ± 0.04Y434F/K446Q/D461N4-cindicates data from Finn et al.

The increased sensitivity to tetrabenazine appears to derive independently from Ala-315 in TMD7 and Tyr-434, Lys-446, and Asp-461 in TMD9–12. The ability of VMAT2 to recognize histamine requires Pro-237 in TMD5 as well as Tyr-434 and Asp-461 in TMD9–12, and the comparison of single and multiple mutants suggests that although not all the residues involved in histamine recognition have been identified, Pro-237 and TMD9–12 contribute to a single recognition site. In contrast, essentially all of the residues from TMD5–8 of VMAT1 increase serotonin affinity relative to VMAT2, and this effect dominates over mutations in TMD9–12, strongly supporting distinct roles for the two regions in substrate recognition. Similar to Tyr-434 in TMD9–12, replacement of Pro-237 and other residues in TMD5–8 of VMAT2 with equivalent residues from VMAT1 improves tryptamine recognition. However, unlike VMAT1 substitutions into TMD5–8 of VMAT2 that increase serotonin recognition, Y434F impairs the apparent affinity for serotonin, further indicating that the two sites interact with distinct features of the ligand. Thus, although the recognition of histamine appears to involve a single recognition site contributed by both major domains, VMAT2 recognizes the other ligands through multiple independent interactions."

Sequences in these extensions reduce the activity of the homology domain in promoting initiation complex formation with chloroplast mRNAs and 30 S ribosomal subunits. A series of deletions of the NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions of IF3chlwere constructed and tested for their effects on the activity of the homology domain. About half of the inhibitory effect arises from sequences within 9 residues of the junction between the NH2-terminal extension and the homology domain.

During initiation, IF3 binds to the 30 S subunit and shifts the equilibrium between the ribosome and its subunits toward dissociation (3Paci M. Pon C. Lammi M. Gualerzi C. J. Biol.

IF1 and IF2 bind to the 30 S·IF3 complex. The initiation factor·30 S complex binds the mRNA and fMet-tRNA, resulting in the formation of an unstable preinitiation complex.

Only IF2chl and IF3chl from Euglena gracilis have been purified (15Ma L. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13560-13565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wang C.C. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17079-17083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these factors are nuclear-encoded proteins in this organism (17Lin Q. Ma L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. J.

IF3chlhas been resolved into three forms, α, β, and γ. The α form has a molecular mass of about 34 kDa, whereas the β and γ forms have molecular masses of about 45 kDa (16Wang C.C. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17079-17083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, E. coliIF3 has a molecular mass of 20 kDa. IF3chl is active onE. coli ribosomes. A complete cDNA encoding E. gracilis IF3chlhas been cloned and sequenced (17Lin Q. Ma L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9436-9444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass deduced from the nucleotide sequence is 58 kDa, including a signal peptide of 130–140 residues required for localization to the chloroplast. The mature form of this factor (IF3chlM) can be divided into three parts (Fig. 1). An NH2-terminal extension termed the head (Hd) region encompasses the first 140 amino acids. This region contains a proline-rich sequence followed by a (GX)12 motif and a short acidic sequence. A middle region of about 180 amino acids shows homology to prokaryotic IF3 and is referred to as the homology (H) domain (19Lin Q. Yu N. Spremulli L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of E. coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus IF3 indicates that this region will fold into two highly compact domains separated by a lysine-rich linker (20Garcia C. Fortier P.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6183-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal extension is referred to as the tail (T) region. This 64-amino acid region is rich in glutamic acid residues (17Lin Q. Ma L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9436-9444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that both IF3chlM and the homology domain, IF3chlH, are active in promoting the dissociation of ribosomal subunits and in promoting initiation complex formation on E. coli ribosomes using poly(A,U,G) as an mRNA (19Lin Q. Yu N. Spremulli L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, IF3chlM is only 10–20% as active as IF3chlH in promoting initiation complex formation on chloroplast 30 S ribosomal subunits using mRNAs carrying natural translational start sites for chloroplast mRNAs (19Lin Q. Yu N. Spremulli L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that sequences in the head and tail regions of IF3chl down-regulate the activity of this factor in initiation. In the present work, the roles of sequences in the head and tail regions in affecting the activity of IF3chl have been examined in more detail. [35S]fMet-tRNA and [14C]AcPhe-tRNA were prepared as described (25Graves M. Spremulli L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.

Qiagen pQE vectors were used to express IF3chl or its derivatives carrying a His tag at the COOH terminus. The regions of IF3chl to be expressed were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the cDNA clone described previously (17Lin Q. Ma L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol.

Cells were grown and IF3chl derivatives were induced as described previously (19Lin Q. Yu N. Spremulli L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Induction times were as follows: 45 min for IF3chlHdH, 20 min for IF3chlHT, and 2–3 h for the remaining constructs. IF3chlHdH was purified as described for IF3chlM (19Lin Q. Yu N. Spremulli L.

Spremulli L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The indicated concentrations of IF3chl and chloroplast 30 S subunits were incubated in a total volume of 250 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 mm NH4Cl, and 10 mmMgCl2 at room temperature for 5 min. The mixture was applied to a 5-ml 10–30% linear sucrose gradient prepared in the same buffer except that the concentration of Tris-HCl was reduced to 10 mm. Samples were subjected to centrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 2 h in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Gradients were fractionated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (100 μl) were collected from the region of the gradient containing the 30 S subunits. Aliquots (50 μl) of appropriate fractions were analyzed for the amount of IF3chl present using an ELISA (32Browning K.S. Humphreys J. Hobbs W. Smith G.B. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17967-17973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A standard curve for each derivative tested was determined in each experiment to allow the amount of IF3chl present to be quantified. The abilities of IF3chl and its derivatives to promote initiation complex formation with E. coli 70 S ribosomes using poly(A,U,G) were assayed as described (19Lin Q. Yu N. Spremulli L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The abilities of IF3chl and its derivatives to promote initiation complex formation with chloroplast 30 S subunits and mRbcN were determined as indicated (19Lin Q. Yu N. Spremulli L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This assay has been modified from the method described in Ref. 33Gualerzi C. Risuleo G. Pon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 44-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for E. coli IF3. A complex carrying AcPhe-tRNA bound to chloroplast 30 S subunits (AcPhe-tRNA·poly(U)·30 S) was formed by incubation of chloroplast 30 S subunits (10 pmol) with poly(U) (2.5 μg) and AcPhe-tRNA (4 pmol) in a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmNH4Cl, and 15 mm MgCl2. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the mixture was diluted 2-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 50 mmNH4Cl in the presence of different concentrations of IF3chl or its derivatives. Mixtures were incubated for an additional 5 min at 37 °C. The destabilization of the complex by IF3chl was monitored following dilution with 1 ml of prewarmed dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NH4Cl, and 7.5 mm MgCl2). These reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The amount of initiation complex remaining was determined by a nitrocellulose filter binding assay (19Lin Q. Yu N. Spremulli L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A similar assay was also carried out using a complex formed with 30 S subunits (10 pmol), poly(A,U,G) (2.5 μg) and fMet-tRNA (4 pmol). Previous studies have shown that the mature form of IF3chl(IF3chlM) is almost as active as the homology domain (IF3chlH) in an assay that measures the ability of IF3chl to promote the binding of fMet-tRNA to E. coli 70 S ribosomes using poly(A,U,G). However, IF3chlM shows very poor activity in promoting the binding of fMet-tRNA to chloroplast 30 S subunits in the presence of an mRNA carrying the translational initiation region of a natural mRNA (19Lin Q. Yu N. Spremulli L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that the head, the tail, or both have a negative effect on the activity of the homology domain of IF3chl. To investigate which region or regions of IF3chlM are responsible for this inhibitory effect, the activities of a series of derivatives of IF3chl containing different parts of IF3chl (Fig.1) were tested. These derivatives were designed based on the structures of the two best characterized prokaryotic IF3s (from E. coli and B. stearothermophilus). The IF3s from these organisms have very similar overall three-dimensional structures (20Garcia C. Fortier P. Blanquet S. Lallemand J. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Garcia C. Fortier P. Blanquet S. Lallemand J. Dardel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Biou V. Shu F. Ramakrishnan V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4056-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, B. stearothermophilus IF3 is 9 residues shorter thanE. coli IF3 at the NH2 terminus. Chloroplast homologues of both these prokaryotic IF3s were prepared (Fig. 1). IF3chlsrH is the homologue of B. stearothermophilus IF3, whereas IF3chlrH is the homologue of E. coli IF3. These two forms of IF3chl differ by 9 residues at the NH2terminus. To test the effects of sequences in the NH2-terminal extension, a derivative, IF3chlHdH, encompassing the homology domain and the entire head region was prepared. To test the effects of sequences in the COOH-terminal extension, a derivative, IF3chlsHT, covering the homology domain and the entire tail region was prepared. Note that this derivative of IF3chl begins at the position corresponding to the start of the B. stearothermophilusfactor. The induction of IF3chlsHT, like IF3chlM, results in a significant decrease in cell growth, indicating that the tail of IF3chl is quite toxic to the cell. The induction of IF3chlHdH has less effect on cell growth, whereas the expression of IF3chlsrH does not affect cell growth to an appreciable extent (data not shown). Each derivative of IF3chl was purified; the derivatives were estimated to be 90–95% pure in all cases (Fig. 2). The activity of each construct in promoting the binding of fMet-tRNA toE. coli 70 S ribosomes was examined. As indicated in Fig.3 A, all of these forms of IF3chl were quite active in this assay. IF3chlHdH and IF3chlsHT had slightly less activity than IF3chlsrH but slightly more activity than IF3chlM. These results indicate that the head and tail had little effect on the activity of IF3chl when E. coli 70 S ribosomes and a synthetic mRNA, poly(A,U,G), were used. These derivatives of IF3chl were then tested for the ability to promote the binding of fMet-tRNA to chloroplast 30 S subunits using an mRNA carrying the translational initiation region of the rbcL gene. As shown previously and as indicated in Fig. 3 B, IF3chlM had only 15–20% of the activity of the homology domain of IF3chl in this assay. The effect of sequences in the head was assessed by comparing the activity of IF3chlHdH with IF3chlsrH (Fig.3 B). The head region reduced the activity of the homology domain by 2-fold, indicating that the head accounts for about half of the reduction in activity seen with IF3chlM. To assess the effect of sequences in the tail, the activity of IF3chlsHT was tested. IF3chlsHT had about 30% of the activity seen with IF3chlsrH (Fig. 3 B), indicating that sequences in the tail account for a little over half of the inhibitory effect seen in IF3chlM. The results presented above indicate that sequences in both the head and the tail of IF3chlM have a negative effect on the ability of the homology domain to promote initiation complex formation. Additional constructs were then prepared to narrow down the inhibitory region in the head. IF3chlerH (Fig. 1) covers the homology region and 15 residues of the head from the NH2 terminus of IF3chlsrH (the B. stearothermophilus homologue) to the edge of (GX)12-acidic motif (19Lin Q. Yu N. Spremulli L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). IF3chlrH, theE. coli homologue, is 9 residues longer than IF3chlsrH at the NH2 terminus (Fig. 1). The induction of either IF3chlrH or IF3chlerH retards cell growth indicating that their expression is toxic toE. coli (data not shown). Both IF3chlrH and IF3chlerH were purified (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 6). IF3chlrH and IF3chlerH were as active as IF3chlsrH when tested on E. coli 70 S ribosomes (Fig. 4 A). However, IF3chlrH and IF3chlerH, like IF3chlHdH, had half the activity of IF3chlsrH when tested on chloroplast 30 S subunits (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that only 9 residues in the NH2-terminal extension measured from the B. stearothermophilus factor are required to give the inhibitory effect of the entire head region. This observation is quite surprising because IF3chlrH is the same length at the NH2 terminus as E. coli IF3. The activity of E. coli IF3 decreases markedly without the NH2-terminal hexapeptide (34Lammi M. Pon C. Gualerzi C. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig.3 B, the tail region contributed about half of the negative regulatory effect seen with the mature form of IF3chl. Secondary structure analysis indicated that the tail probably contains two long helices that have a high probability of forming a coiled-coil. To gain further insight into which sequences in the tail might be responsible for this result, a derivative was prepared (IF3chlsHT/3) that contained about 1/3 of the sequences in the tail encompassing residues through the first helix (Fig. 1). The induction of IF3chlsHT/3 had little effect on the growth of E. coli. IF3chlsHT/3 was purified to greater than 95% purity (Fig. 2, lane 7). IF3chlsHT/3 had essentially the same activity as IF3chlsrH when E. coli 70 ribosomes are used. When chloroplast 30 S subunits and mRbcN were used, IF3chlsHT/3 was as active as IF3chlsrH (Fig.5 B). This result indicates that the last 2/3 of the tail region are essential for the inhibitory effect of the tail. To test the effects from the short NH2- and the entire COOH-terminal extension, IF3chlHT, consisting of the homology domain surrounded by the tail and 15 residues of the head (Fig. 1), was prepared and purified (Fig. 2, lane 8). The induction of IF3chlHT resulted in a significant decrease in cell growth and eventually appeared to cause cell lysis. IF3chlHT had activity slightly lower than that of IF3chlsrH but the same as that of IF3chlsHT and IF3chlM when tested on E. coli 70 ribosomes with poly(A,U,G) (Fig. 5 A). When chloroplast 30 S subunits and mRbcN were used, IF3chlHT had the same low activity observed with IF3chlM (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that IF3chlHT contains all the negative regulatory elements present in IF3chlM and that the negative effects due to sequences in the head and tail are additive. In an attempt to understand whether the low activity of IF3chlHT could be overcome by raising the concentrations of 30 S subunits, mRNA, or IF2, assays were carried out using different amounts of each component, separately. As indicated in Fig. 6, increasing the concentration of chloroplast 30 S subunits, mRbcN, or IF2 did not allow IF3chlHT to increase its activity relative to the activity of IF3chlsrH. Similar results were obtained when the levels of either IF2chl or E. coli IF2 were varied. These observations suggest that the low activity of IF3chlHT is a complex phenomenon involving the interplay of IF3chl with multiple components of the initiation machinery. The activities of several derivatives of IF3chl in promoting initiation complex formation on chloroplast 30 S subunits were tested in the presence of either the α or the β form of IF2chl (data not shown) and E. coli IF2. The results of this study indicated that all of the negative regulatory effects from the head and tail regions are seen in the presence of either form of IF2chl or E. coli IF2. The natural mRNA used above (mRbcN) carries the initiation region of the rbcL gene. This region does not have a Shine/Dalgarno sequence. Indeed, about half of the chloroplast mRNAs in E. gracilis lack a Shine/Dalgarno sequence (35Koo J.S. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7494-7500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Betts L. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26456-26463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The negative effects of the head and tail were also tested with an mRNA carrying the translational start site for the atpHgene, which has a Shine/Dalgarno sequence just upstream of the start codon. The head and tail also inhibited the activity of the homology domain when this mRNA was used (data not shown). Direct measurements of the abilities of various derivatives of IF3chl to bind to chloroplast 30 S subunits were carried out using sucrose density gradient centrifugation. For these experiments, the appropriate derivatives of IF3chl were incubated with chloroplast 30 S subunits. The bound factor was separated from the free factor by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The amount of IF3chl bound to the 30 S subunit was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The amount of IF3chl bound was calculated based on a standard curve providing a measure of the response of each IF3chlderivative to the antibody. The standard curves for each of the derivatives are quite similar (Table I). This observation was expected because the antibodies were raised against the homology domain. The total amount of each derivative of IF3chl bound to 30 S subunits and the estimatedKobs are indicated in Table I. IF3srH had the highest affinity for 30 S subunits, with a Kobs= 1.3 × 107m−1. This value is similar to the affinity of E. coli IF3 for E. coli 30 S subunits (K = 2.5 × 107m−1) (37Weiel J. Hershey J. Levison S. FEBS Lett. 1978; 87: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). IF3chlerH and IF3chlsHT bound to 30 S subunits with about 10-fold lower affinity than IF3chlsrH. IF3chlHT showed the lowest ability to bind, with aKobs approximately 100-fold lower than that of IF3chlsrH. These results suggest that the small NH2-terminal extension region and the full tail interfere with the ability of IF3chl to bind to 30 S subunits. IF3chlHT, which contains both regions, showed the lowest affinity for chloroplast 30 S subunits. Because the low activity of IF3chlHT was not overcome by raising the concentration of 30 S subunits (Fig. 6), the head and tail must still down-regulate the activity of IF3chl after this factor binds to 30 S subunits.Table IBinding of IF-3chl to 30 S subunits1-a [IF3]0 and [30 Schl]0 indicate the initial concentrations of the indicated derivatives of IF3chl and of 30 S subunits.1-b Quantitated from the standard curve shown to the left.1-c Calculated from the equation 30 S + IF3chl ⇄ [30 S·IF3chl].

In E. coli, IF3 is believed to proofread the selection of the initiator tRNA and the AUG start codon (10Hartz D. McPheeters D. Gold L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1899-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 11Hartz D. Binkley J. Hollingsworth T. Gold L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1790-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Sussman J. Simons E. Simons R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,38Risuleo G. Gualerzi C. Pon C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One procedure for monitoring this function is to examine the ability of IF3 to destabilize preformed initiation complexes consisting of 30 S ribosomal subunits carrying poly(U) and AcPhe-tRNA (33Gualerzi C. Risuleo G. Pon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 44-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Risuleo G. Gualerzi C. Pon C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This destabilization affects all initiation complexes with the exception of those containing the initiator fMet-tRNA at an AUG codon, which remains resistant to the destabilization induced by IF3 (39Pon C. Gualerzi C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4950-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The ability of IF3chl to proofread in the chloroplast system was examined by testing its ability to promote the dissociation of a preformed 30 S·poly(U)·AcPhe-tRNA complex. IF3chlsrH has the greatest ability to destabilize the 30 S·poly(U)·AcPhe-tRNA complex (Fig.7 A). This observation is in agreement with its greater ability to bind to 30 S subunits and to promote initiation complex formation. IF3chlHT shows the least activity in this assay, however, it still has some ability to proofread. Surprisingly, all of the reduced proofreading ability seen with IF3chlHT is also observed with IF3chlerH. IF3chlsHT has more than half of the proofreading ability of IF3chlsrH. These observations suggest that sequences in the head region interfere with proofreading to a greater extent than those in the tail region. The ability of derivatives of IF3chl to discriminate between initiation complexes containing fMet-tRNA was also tested (Fig. 7 B). None of the derivatives that were examined destabilized the binding of fMet-tRNA to 30 S subunits. Indeed, some stimulation of fMet-tRNA binding was observed with IF3chlsrH even under the dilute conditions used in this assay. This stimulation presumably reflects the high activity of this derivative in promoting initiation complex formation. IF3chl from E. gracilis is the first organellar IF3 that has been cloned and over-expressed. The results presented here indicate that a 9-residue sequence in the head region of IF3chl and sequences in the tail play a negative regulatory role in promoting initiation complex formation on chloroplast ribosomes. Structural studies on E. coli and B. stearothermophilus IF3 (20Garcia C. Fortier P. Blanquet S. Lallemand J. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Garcia C. Fortier P. Blanquet S. Lallemand J. Dardel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Biou V. Shu F. Ramakrishnan V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4056-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) indicate that both factors fold into two compact domains separated by a lysine-rich linker (Fig.8). These two domains are formed by the independent folding of sequences in the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal halves of the protein. The center of mass of the two domains are separated by about 45 Å (22Biou V. Shu F. Ramakrishnan V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4056-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the NH2-domain and COOH-domain of B. stearothermophilus IF3 (Fig. 8) indicate that both the NH2 and COOH termini are oriented toward the central linker. The linker is highly basic and could play an important role in interacting with 16S rRNA, tRNA, or mRNA (21Garcia C. Fortier P. Blanquet S. Lallemand J. Dardel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both domains of IF3 are thought to be involved in ribosome binding (22Biou V. Shu F. Ramakrishnan V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4056-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because the head and tail of IF3chl extend toward the linker region, they may interact with specific residues in the linker region, which are important for the binding of IF3 to the 30 S subunit and for its function after it binds. The negative influence of sequences in the tail and of residues near the junction between the head and the homology domain on the activity of IF3chl suggests that there must be a mechanism by which these effects may be modulated in vivo. One attractive hypothesis is that these regions down-regulate the intrinsic activity of IF3chl and that other factors in the chloroplast alleviate this inhibition under appropriate conditions. This idea is based on numerous observations that indicate that chloroplast protein synthesis is regulated in response to light and mRNA-specific trans-acting factors (40Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 41Staub J. Maliga P. Plant J. 1994; 6: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 42Wu H. Kuchka M. Curr.

Because IF3chl is required for the translation of all mRNAs, it could play a key role in modulating the activity of the chloroplast translational system as a whole, for example, in response to light or developmental signals. In addition, trans-acting factors bound to specific chloroplast mRNAs could interact with IF3chl to recruit this factor for the translation of a specific mRNA. The most logical region of IF3chl to interact with such putative regulatory proteins is the head. The rationale for this idea is as follows. The head has an unusual amino acid sequence and, presumably, structure. It contains a Pro-rich region reminiscent of many protein-protein interaction sites and their flanking regions (48Kini R. Evans H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 49Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quillam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A. 1995; 92: 3110-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Prominent examples of such sites include proteins recognized by SH3 domains or the WW motif found in many proteins participating in regulatory cascades. The (GX)n motif (glycine-X motif, whereX indicates a large basic hydrophobic residue) following the Pro-rich region would be expected to have significant structural flexibility and could function as a flexible hinge region. In a working model (Fig. 9), IF3chl is visualized as being in a low activity state due to the negative effects from the extensions on the homology domain (Fig. 9). In this low activity state, the activity of IF3chl would limit the rate of translation in the chloroplast to some basal amount. This level would, presumably, allow the chloroplast to maintain the amounts of critical proteins at minimum required levels. In the presence of appropriate environmental signals (for example, in conditions promoting photosynthesis), a regulatory factor interacts with the head on IF3chl relieving the inhibitory effects and allowing the homology domain to become fully active. A protein affecting the activity of IF3chl could potentially act either in general, increasing the overall rate of chloroplast protein synthesis, or more specifically, promoting the translation of specific mRNAs. In the latter case, IF3chl can be envisioned as playing a role in tying mRNA-specific trans-acting factors to the general translational machinery. Current efforts are designed to gain insight into the factors that modulate the activity of IF3chl and, thus, the rate of chloroplast protein synthesis."

Faraci and Walsh (10Faraci W.S. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3267-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) proposed a mechanism for alanine racemase that is probably similar to that of other PLP-dependent amino acid racemases. The reaction is initiated by transaldimination. In this step, PLP bound with the active-site lysyl residue through an internal Schiff base (Scheme FSI A) reacts with a substrate to form an external Schiff base (B). The subsequent α-hydrogen abstraction results in the formation of a resonance-stable anionic intermediate (C). If the reprotonation occurs at C-2 of the substrate moiety on the opposite face of the planar intermediate to that where the proton abstraction occurs, an antipodal aldimine is formed (D). The aldimine complex is subsequently hydrolyzed to form isomerized amino acid and regenerates the bound PLP (E). The random return of hydrogen to the anionic intermediate is a characteristic of enzymatic racemization among various pyridoxal enzyme reactions. In aminotransferase reactions, the abstracted hydrogen is stereospecifically transferred to C-4′ of the cofactor, and a ketimine intermediate is formed (11Martinez-Carrion M. Hubert E. Iriarte A. Mattingly J.R. Zito S.W. Christen P. Metzler D.E. Transaminases. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 308-316Google Scholar). The pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) form of the enzyme and a keto acid are produced by hydrolysis of the ketimine intermediate. Amino acid racemases are reported to catalyze the transamination as a side reaction (12Yorifuji T. Misono H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5093-5101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transamination catalyzed by amino acid racemases can be attained through a sequence either A → B → F (or G) → H or A → B → C → F (or G) → H (Scheme FSI). An equivalent route can be delineated for the antipode: E → D → F (or G) → H or E → D → C → F (or G) → H. In transamination, mutual hydrogen transfer between the substrate and C-4′ of the cofactor occurs.

Chem. 1982; 257: 3564-3569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the hydrogen transfer between substrate and cofactor occurs strictly stereospecifically on the si or re face of the plane of the anionic intermediate. However, if the transamination catalyzed by amino acid racemases proceeds as depicted in Scheme FSI, the hydrogen transfer should occur nonstereospecifically on both faces of the planar intermediate. We were therefore interested in the stereospecificity of the hydrogen transfer during transamination catalyzed by amino acid racemases as a side reaction. We provide here the first evidence that hydrogen removal from C-4′ of PMP occurs randomly on both faces of the substrate-cofactor imine plane during half transamination catalyzed by the amino acid racemases. We also show that the enzyme catalyzes nonstereospecific overall transamination between l-ornithine and α-ketoglutarate as well. Amino acid racemases with low substrate specificity from P. putida (9Lim Y.-H. Yokoigawa K. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 175: 4213-4217Crossref Google Scholar), P. striata (8Soda K. Osumi T. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 17B: 629-636Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and A. punctata (7Inagaki K. Tanizawa K. Tanaka H. Soda K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 173-180Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. BCAT of Escherichia coli K-12 (22Kuramitsu S. Ogawa H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was kindly supplied by Professor H. Kagamiyama and Dr. K. Inoue of Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan. AspAT from pig heart was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany), 3H2O (3.7 GBq/g) was from DuPont. The other chemicals were of analytical grade. The activity of the amino acid racemases was determined by measurement of a change in optical rotation at 365 nm with a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter and also by a coupled assay procedure with d- or l-amino acid oxidase (9Lim Y.-H. Yokoigawa K. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 175: 4213-4217Crossref Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by dye staining with a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Apo-amino acid racemases were prepared as described previously (7Inagaki K. Tanizawa K. Tanaka H. Soda K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 173-180Google Scholar). An appropriate amount of enzyme (1–3 mg) was dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 30 mm hydroxylamine and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 24 h and then dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at 4 °C overnight. The apoenzyme formed was determined by measurement of the activity of the enzyme in the presence or absence of 10 mmPLP. Apo-enzymes recovered about 80% of their initial activities on addition of PLP. Apo-AspAT, apo-d-AAT, and apo-BCAT were prepared as described previously (17Yoshimura T. Nishimura K. Ito J. Esaki N. Kagamiyama H. Manning J.M. Soda K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3897-3900Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric measurements were made with a Shimadzu UV-visible recording spectrophotometer UV-260 with a 1.0-cm light path at 25 °C. (4′S)- and (4′R)-[4′-3H]PMP were prepared by incubation of the randomly labeled [4′-3H]PMP with apo-BCAT and apo-AspAT, respectively, as described previously (17Yoshimura T. Nishimura K. Ito J. Esaki N. Kagamiyama H. Manning J.M. Soda K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3897-3900Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivities of (4′S)- and (4′R)-[4′3H]PMP prepared were 1.54 × 106 and 1.35 × 106 dpm/μmol, respectively. Stereospecificities for labeling were confirmed by measurement of tritium liberation from both PMPs catalyzed by apo-BCAT and apo-AspAT in the presence of α-ketoglutarate as described previously (17Yoshimura T. Nishimura K. Ito J. Esaki N. Kagamiyama H. Manning J.M. Soda K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3897-3900Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 10 μmol of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 5 nmol of sodium pyruvate, 1 nmol of (4′S)- or (4′R)-[4′-3H]PMP, and 5 nmol of each apo-amino acid racemase. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 3 h and terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl. The mixture was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and dried with a Speed Vac concentrator. The residue was dissolved with 200 μl of H2O and subjected to a radioactivity assay. The tritium released from PMP was expressed as volatile radioactivity, which was estimated by subtraction of the radioactivity finally remaining from the radioactivity initially added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture (100 μl) with apo-d-AAT and apo-AspAT contained 10 μmol of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 10 nmol of sodium α-ketoglutarate, 1.0 nmol of (4′S)- or (4′R)-[4′-3H]PMP, and 168 μg of apo-AspAT or 182 μg of apo-d-AAT, respectively. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl. Other conditions were the same as those of the reactions with amino acid racemases. Radioactivity was determined with a Packard Tri-Carb scintillation spectrometer with Clear-solI (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) as a scintillator. The reaction mixture (1 ml) consisted of 10 μmol ofl-ornithine, 10 μmol of α-ketoglutarate, 0.05 μmol of PLP, 50 μmol of Tricine buffer (pH 8.5), and 20 μg of enzyme. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h and terminated by boiling. After centrifugation, amino acids in the supernatant solution were derivatized to diastereomers with Marfey's reagent (23Marfey P. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1984; 49: 591-596Crossref Scopus (1397) Google Scholar) and analyzed by HPLC. When the amino acid racemase of broad substrate specificity from P. putida was incubated with l-alanine, the absorption at 420 nm derived from the internal Schiff base decreased, with a concomitant increase in the absorption at 330 nm (Fig.1 a). This suggests that the coenzyme form of the enzyme was converted from PLP to PMP during the racemization. The reversal from PMP to PLP also occurred on the basis of a spectral shift. The addition of pyruvate to the PMP form of enzyme, which was prepared by incubation of PMP with the apo-enzyme, led to a decrease in absorbance at 330 nm and an increase in that at 420 nm (Fig. 1 b). Similar spectral shifts were observed in the reactions of the PMP form of the amino acid racemases from P. striata and A. punctata with pyruvate (data not shown). The results indicate that these amino acid racemases catalyze the transamination as a side reaction. Amino acid racemase of P. putida catalyzes the overall transamination between ornithine and pyruvate. The specific activity for the transamination was 0.26 units/mg (∼10.7 min−1). The rate of transamination was lower than that of the racemization of ornithine by a factor of 1.1 × 104. However, the rate of enzymatic transamination was at least several orders of magnitude higher than that of the nonenzymatic transamination, which was lower than the minimum value for accurate determination, ∼4.0 × 10−6 min−1. When the PMP form of an enzyme is converted to the PLP form by transamination with an amino acceptor (keto acid), one of the two hydrogens at C-4′ of PMP is usually transferred stereospecifically to Cα of the keto acid (24Dunathan H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1971; 35: 79-134PubMed Google Scholar). We studied the stereospecificity of amino acid racemases for hydrogen abstraction from C-4′ of PMP using the method described previously (17Yoshimura T. Nishimura K. Ito J. Esaki N. Kagamiyama H. Manning J.M. Soda K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3897-3900Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Stereospecificity is determined by measurement of the radioactivity of 3H released from the PMPs, which are stereospecifically tritiated at C-4′. Each 5 nmol of apo-amino acid racemase was incubated with 1 nmol of (4′S)- or (4′R)-[4′-3H]PMP and 5 nmol of sodium pyruvate. We deduce that PMP was completely converted to PLP, because the PMP form of the amino acid racemase from P. putidarecovered 100% of the activity theoretically expected. As shown in Table I, tritium was released equally from both (4′S)- and (4′R)-[4′-3H]PMPs in the presence of amino acid racemases. The amount of tritium released from each PMP was about 50% that which initially existed. The control experiment was done withd-AAT and AspAT. As reported previously (17Yoshimura T. Nishimura K. Ito J. Esaki N. Kagamiyama H. Manning J.M. Soda K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3897-3900Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar),d-AAT and AspAT catalyzed the stereospecific removal of tritium from (4′R)- or (4′S)-[4′3H]PMP, respectively, as shown in Table I. These results confirm the stereospecific tritium labeling of both PMPs. No tritium was released from each PMP in the absence of enzyme. Thus, the amino acid racemases catalyze the non-stereospecific abstraction of hydrogen from C-4′ of PMP. They are the first class of pyridoxal enzyme catalyzing the hydrogen removal on both sides of the plane of a substrate-cofactor complex during transamination.Table IRelease of 3H from [4′-3H]PMPs by amino acid racemases4′-S-[4′-3H]PMP1-aThe initial radioactivity in the reaction mixture was 1,540 dpm.3H released1-bVolatile radioactivity.4′-R-[4′-3H]PMP1-cThe initial radioactivity in the reaction mixture was 1,340 dpm.3H released1-bVolatile radioactivity.dpm%1-dRatio of the released radioactivity to that initially added in the reaction mixture.dpm%1-dRatio of the released radioactivity to that initially added in the reaction mixture.apo-AAR1-eAmino acid racemase from P. putida.6664365549apo-AAR1-fAmino acid racemase from P. striata.6684371553apo-AAR1-gAmino acid racemase from A. punctata.6754462747apo-d-AAT362.386064apo-AspAT12097800Without enzyme00001-a The initial radioactivity in the reaction mixture was 1,540 dpm.1-b Volatile radioactivity.1-c The initial radioactivity in the reaction mixture was 1,340 dpm.1-d Ratio of the released radioactivity to that initially added in the reaction mixture.1-e Amino acid racemase from P. putida.1-f Amino acid racemase from P. striata.1-g Amino acid racemase from A. punctata. Open table in a new tab If the hydrogen is introduced nonspecifically to C-2 of the keto acid moiety of the anionic intermediate on both sides of the planar intermediate during the half reaction of transamination, racemic amino acid is formed from the keto acid (Scheme FSI; H → F (or G) → C → B → A or H → F (or G) → C → D → E). We studied the stereochemistry of glutamate formed from α-ketoglutarate by transamination with l-ornithine catalyzed by the amino acid racemase of P. putida. After the reaction, the products were derivatized to diastereomers with Marfey's reagent (23Marfey P. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1984; 49: 591-596Crossref Scopus (1397) Google Scholar) and subjected to HPLC. As shown in Fig. 2, both enantiomers of glutamate and ornithine were found. The amino acid racemase from P. putida catalyzes the racemization of ornithine, but glutamate is inert as a substrate for the racemase reaction (9Lim Y.-H. Yokoigawa K. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 175: 4213-4217Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, both enantiomers of glutamate were directly formed by transamination, not by racemization of one enantiomer produced through transamination. Amino acid racemase from P. putidacatalyzes the nonstereospecific overall transamination. We here show that nonstereospecific hydrogen abstraction from C-4′ of PMP occurs in the transamination between PMP and pyruvate catalyzed by amino acid racemases with broad substrate specificity. The enzyme from P. putida also catalyzes nonstereospecific overall transamination between ornithine and α-ketoglutarate. These results indicate that the cleavage and formation of the C–H bonds at C-4′ of the coenzyme occur on both sides of the plane of the anionic intermediate. This model is compatible with the proposed mechanism for racemization. The removal and return of α-hydrogen of substrate occur on both sides of the plane (Scheme FSI). It may be interesting to examine whether the removal of substrate α-hydrogen and the introduction of coenzyme C-4′ hydrogen occur on the same side of the plane. The examination will be facilitated by analysis of the configuration of3H-labeled PMP formed in 3H2O by transamination with either d or l enantiomer of an appropriate substrate. However, the amino acid used for this purpose needs to be inert as a substrate for racemization; otherwise, PMP will be also derived from the antipode of the substrate enantiomer added initially. Glutamate might be the only candidate substrate for this purpose; however, this is not the case. Glutamate is inert as an amino donor in transamination, 2Lim, Y.-H., Yoshimura, T., Kurokawa, Y., Esaki, N., and Soda, K, unpublished results.although α-ketoglutarate serves as an amino acceptor as described above. Two mechanisms have been proposed for enzymatic racemization: a two-base mechanism and a one-base mechanism (25Cardinale G.J. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3979-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 26Soda K. Tanaka H. Tanizawa K. Dorphin D. Pyridoxal Phosphate: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. 1B. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 223-251Google Scholar). In the two-base mechanism, two different bases participate in the catalysis; one abstracts the hydrogen from a substrate, and the other returns a hydrogen to the deprotonated intermediate.

Chem. 1984; 259: 8907-8914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which do not require cofactors, catalyze racemization by this mechanism. In the one-base mechanism, a single amino acid residue abstracts the α-hydrogen from a substrate and nonstereospecifically returns it to the anionic intermediate. A swinging door motion has been proposed by Henderson and Johnston (33Henderson L.L. Johnston R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 68: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as a model to fit the one-base mechanism; the plane of the substrate·PLP complex acts like a swinging door in order that the base can be located on both faces of the plane. If only a single base is involved, one can expect that the α-hydrogen derived from the substrate will be retained at the α-position of the product (25Cardinale G.J. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3979-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Such an internal retention of the α-hydrogen was verified in the reactions catalyzed by two PLP-dependent racemases: amino acid racemase with low substrate specificity from P. striata(34Shen S. Floss H.G. Kumagai H. Yamada H. Esaki N. Soda K. Wasserman S.A. Walsh C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1983; : 82-83Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and α-amino-ε-caprolactam racemase from Achromobacter obae (35Ahmed S.A. Esaki N. Tanaka H. Soda K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, it was supposed that these reactions proceed through a single-base mechanism (34Shen S. Floss H.G. Kumagai H. Yamada H. Esaki N. Soda K. Wasserman S.A. Walsh C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1983; : 82-83Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Ahmed S.A. Esaki N. Tanaka H. Soda K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, Shostak and Schirch (36Shostak K. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8007-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) argued in their studies on the mechanism of alanine racemization catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase that the internal retention of the substrate-derived α-hydrogen could also allow a two-base mechanism by assuming a hydrogen shuttle between the bases as proposed for the aconitase reaction; the latter enzyme is known to have a network of at least five interchangeable protons at the active site that only exchange slowly with the solvent (37Kuo D.J. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7589-7596Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although the reaction catalyzed by the amino acid racemase from P. striata was accompanied by clear internal retention of the α-hydrogen, a two-base mechanism has been proposed on the basis of the complete disagreement between the substrate enantiomers examined for the relative rates of deuterium incorporation from 2H2O into separate enantiomers (38Reynolds K. Martin J. Shen S.-J. Esaki N. Soda K. Floss H.G. J. Basic Microbiol. 1991; 31: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our findings shown here indicate that the catalytic base(s) responsible for α-hydrogen abstraction and addition are situated on both faces of the plane of the substrate-cofactor complex. Our enzyme is assumed to be closely homologous to the P. striata enzyme, because the latter strain is now classified into the same group as P. putida. If this is the case, our enzyme would also use two bases for catalysis. Recently, Shaw et al. (39Shaw J.S. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) clarified the three-dimensional structure of alanine racemase from Bacillus stearothermophilus. They suggested that Tyr-265 and Lys-39, the PLP binding lysine, serve as the bases. Sawada et al. have presented kinetic evidence to show that the alanine racemase reaction follows a two-base mechanism (40Sawada S. Tanaka Y. Hayashi S. Ryu M. Hasegawa T. Yamamoto Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Takahashi S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 807-811Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The stereospecificity for the hydrogen transfer reflects the structure of the active site of pyridoxal enzymes, especially the topographical relationship between the catalytic base for the hydrogen transfer and the bound coenzyme. Therefore, stereospecificity has been discussed in relation to the molecular evolution of the pyridoxal enzymes (17Yoshimura T. Nishimura K. Ito J. Esaki N. Kagamiyama H. Manning J.M. Soda K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3897-3900Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Voet J.G. Hindenlang D.M. Blanck T.J.J. Ulevitch R.J. Kallen R.G. Dunathan H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 841-842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Dunathan H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1971; 35: 79-134PubMed Google Scholar). No whole primary structure or three-dimensional structure of amino acid racemases with low substrate specificity has been determined. However, the primary structures of alanine racemases, which are homologous to the amino acid racemases in the sequences around the lysine residue binding PLP (41Tanizawa K. Ohshima A. Scheidegger A. Inagaki K. Tanaka H. Soda K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), show few similarities to those of other PLP enzymes (42Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, amino acid racemase with low substrate specificity probably belongs to the same family of proteins as alanine racemase: a unique family containing only alanine racemase, mammalian ornithine decarboxylase, and meso-α,ε-diaminopimelate (DAP) decarboxylase with little similarity to other PLP enzymes (43Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We have shown that the decarboxylation of DAP catalyzed by DAP decarboxylase proceeds through inversion of the configuration of the α-carbon of DAP (29Asada Y. Tanizawa K. Sawada S. Suzuki T. Misono H. Soda K. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6881-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This indicates that the enzyme function must be conducted on both sides of the plane of the substrate·PLP complex so as to decarboxylate on one side and to introduce a proton on the other side. The DAP decarboxylase reaction is homologous to the racemase reaction in this respect. It may be interesting to examine whether DAP decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase catalyze the removal of tritium nonstereospecifically from C-4′ of both (4′S)- and (4′R)-[4′-3H]PMP in the same manner as amino acid racemase with low substrate specificity. Our preliminary results have shown that alanine racemase from B. stearothermophilusalso catalyzes the nonstereospecific removal of tritium from both [4′-3H]PMPs. Whatever the results of the DAP decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase reactions may be, it is interesting to note the clear relationship between the stereospecificity of hydrogen transfer and families of PLP enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1994088955,"Many aspects of the mechanism by which the GroEL/ES chaperonins mediate protein folding are still unclear, including the amount of structure present in the substrate bound to GroEL. To address this issue we have analyzed the susceptibility to limited proteolysis and to alkylation of cysteine residues of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mAAT) bound to GroEL. Several regions of the N-terminal portion of GroEL-bound mAAT are highly susceptible to proteolysis, whereas a large core of about 200 residues containing the C-terminal half of the polypeptide chain is protected in the complex. This protection does not extend to the mAAT sulfhydryl groups which in the GroEL-mAAT complex have similar reactivity as in fully unfolded mAAT. These results suggest that the mAAT species bound to GroEL represent folding intermediates with a conformation that is substantially more disorganized than that of the native state. The N-terminal half of the molecule is more flexible and lies exposed at the mouth of the central cavity of GroEL. The more compact C-terminal section of mAAT, which contains residues located at the subunit interface in the native dimer, appears to be hidden in the central cavity of GroEL. Thus, the bulk of the interactions in the GroEL·mAAT complex seems to involve residues from the more compact C-terminal section of the substrate. Many aspects of the mechanism by which the GroEL/ES chaperonins mediate protein folding are still unclear, including the amount of structure present in the substrate bound to GroEL. To address this issue we have analyzed the susceptibility to limited proteolysis and to alkylation of cysteine residues of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mAAT) bound to GroEL. Several regions of the N-terminal portion of GroEL-bound mAAT are highly susceptible to proteolysis, whereas a large core of about 200 residues containing the C-terminal half of the polypeptide chain is protected in the complex. This protection does not extend to the mAAT sulfhydryl groups which in the GroEL-mAAT complex have similar reactivity as in fully unfolded mAAT. These results suggest that the mAAT species bound to GroEL represent folding intermediates with a conformation that is substantially more disorganized than that of the native state. The N-terminal half of the molecule is more flexible and lies exposed at the mouth of the central cavity of GroEL. The more compact C-terminal section of mAAT, which contains residues located at the subunit interface in the native dimer, appears to be hidden in the central cavity of GroEL. Thus, the bulk of the interactions in the GroEL·mAAT complex seems to involve residues from the more compact C-terminal section of the substrate.

Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22281-22291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the yield of refolding of the chemically denatured proteins decreases dramatically at increasing temperatures, and no refolding can be observed at physiological temperatures (2Mattingly Jr., J.R.

A similar temperature dependence is observed for the folding of the proteins synthesized in a cell-free extract such as rabbit reticulocyte lysate (3Mattingly Jr., J.R. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3925-3937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, folding of these newly translated proteins is much slower than the refolding of the chemically denatured forms in buffer. By contrast, after import into isolated mitochondria at 30 °C mAAT folds rapidly (3Mattingly Jr., J.R. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3925-3937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid and efficient folding of mAAT once it reaches the mitochondrial matrix probably results from the assistance of chaperones present in the matrix, including the mitochondrial members of the hsp60/hsp10 family of chaperones which have been reported to be involved in intramitochondrial folding of other translocated proteins (4Stuart R.A. Cyr D.M. Craig E.A. Neupert W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Indeed, the chaperonins GroEL/GroES from Escherichia coli, which are structurally and functionally homologous (5Rospert S. Glick B.S. Jeno P. Schatz G. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. Proc.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1138-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Many structurally unrelated proteins, both cytosolic and mitochondrial, have been shown to bind GroEL with different affinities in bothin vivo and in vitro conditions. Discharge from the complex and recovery of active dimeric (94 kDa) protein require the presence of both MgATP and the co-chaperonin GroES, although the latter does not seem to be strictly necessary for a number of proteins with a lower affinity for the chaperonin (7Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of GroEL (8Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachiniak A. Horwich A.L.

The protein is a tetradecamer of 57-kDa identical subunits, arranged in a double heptameric ring, which form a cylindrical cavity of ∼45 Å in diameter. A putative polypeptide-binding site, consisting mainly of hydrophobic residues, has been located on the inside surface of the apical domain of each of the subunits, facing the central channel (11Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Indeed, some experimental evidence suggests that the binding of substrate polypeptide takes place within the central cavity of the hsp60 cylinder (12Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W.

However, the details of the interaction between GroEL and its substrates in terms of sequence elements directly involved in recognition and binding or the conformation of the GroEL-bound polypeptides still remain unsolved.

A few common structural features have been identified in many of the GroEL-bound polypeptides including a collapsed, molten globule-like conformation, with a significant amount of native-like secondary structure, lack of stable tertiary structure interactions, and exposed hydrophobic surfaces. Moreover, it has been shown that a peptide, largely unstructured when free in solution, can form an α-helix upon binding to GroEL (30Landry S.J. Jordon R. McMacken R. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 455-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported that, in some cases, GroEL captures aggregation-prone or kinetically trapped intermediates and at least locally unfolds them upon binding, to put them back on the productive folding pathway (23Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,29Peralta F. Hartman D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Høj P.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).The presence of a molten globule-like intermediate has been proposed for the refolding mechanism of GdnHCl-unfolded pmAAT (1Reyes A.M. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22281-22291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This transient intermediate(s), which rapidly forms upon dilution of the denaturant and then slowly isomerizes to the native dimer, shows over 80% of the secondary structure found in the native protein and contains exposed hydrophobic surfaces. These properties, together with their high propensity to aggregate, make these species good potential substrates for binding to GroEL, which is able to suppress aggregation in the early stages of mAAT refolding (2Mattingly Jr., J.R. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1138-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).In this study, we have investigated some structural aspects of refolding mAAT complexed with GroEL by examining the accessibility of the bound protein to exogenous proteases and thiol-specific reagents. In its native state, mAAT is highly resistant to proteases (31Martinez-Carrion M. Altieri F. Iriarte A. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Youssef J. Wu A. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 585: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and in the absence of substrate none of its seven cysteine residues is accessible to thiol reagents (32Berezov A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 264: 22222-22229Google Scholar). By contrast, we show that the GroEL-bound protein displays susceptibility to proteolysis, particularly in its N-terminal half, and that all the cysteine residues are still highly exposed to alkylating agents. The results obtained provide valuable information with regard to the conformation of a large protein folding intermediate trapped by GroEL.DISCUSSIONWhere along the folding pathway a protein is recognized by GroEL and how much structure is present in the bound substrates are questions that remain unsolved. Some studies have suggested that GroEL-bound polypeptides are fully unfolded, whereas others show that the substrate is partially structured and may contain different degrees of secondary and possibly unstable tertiary interactions (for a recent review, see Ref. 7Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In addition, there are claims that the folding intermediate is fully trapped in the GroEL cavity which may act as a folding cage (14Weissmann J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The present work clarifies some of the issues under debate by showing an overall view of the conformation of mAAT stoichiometrically bound to GroEL in a stable complex.The susceptibility of a polypeptide to exogenous proteases as a probe of its conformation either free in solution (37Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 38Polverino de Laureto P. De Filippis V. Di Bello M. Zambonin M. Fontana A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12596-12604Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as well as in a complex with DNA (39Cohen S.L. Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Burley S.K. Chait B.T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1088-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) or other proteins (40Hlodan R. Tempst P. Hartl F.-U. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 41Khisty V.J. Munske G.R. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25920-25927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) has been used in the past with encouraging results. The rationale behind the method is that amino acid residues that are accessible to protease recognition under controlled conditions must be located within regions of the polypeptide chain exposed to the solvent. However, surface exposure is not a sufficient criteria for proteolysis to occur; chain flexibility is also required for binding of a polypeptide segment to the active site of the protease where the hydrolytic reaction takes place (37Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus, by using the limited proteolysis approach, structural information about both the accessibility to the solvent of specific residues and the local flexibility of the polypeptide chain can be obtained.Native mAAT can be cleaved only in a very limited number of sites, regardless of the specific protease used and only at high temperatures (37 °C) and enzyme:substrate ratios. 3Y. H. Fu, unpublished data. In its crystal structure, each of the two identical subunits of mAAT is composed of a large domain (residues 49–325), a small domain (residues 15–48 and 326–410), and an N-terminal extended region forming a bridge between the two subunits (residues 3–14) (36McPhalen C.A. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 495-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the folded protein the few protease-accessible sites are confined to the N-terminal region, with the cleavable peptide bonds located in the α-helix 1 (Pro16-Arg26) of the small domain and the contiguous β-turn (Asn29-Lys32). For instance, trypsin cleaves after Arg26 and Lys31of chicken mAAT (42Sandmeier E. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10284-10289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The large domain and the C-terminal portion of the small domain in the native transaminase are very resistant to proteolysis (31Martinez-Carrion M. Altieri F. Iriarte A. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Youssef J. Wu A. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 585: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), even after the initial cleavage of the N-terminal peptide, indicating that the overall three-dimensional structure of the dimeric protein is very rigid and stable. At the other extreme of protease susceptibility is the unfolded protein, where all potential tryptic sites are accessible.In the case of a binary complex such as the one under investigation here, additional factors that may contribute to the observed pattern of proteolysis need to be considered. In fact, protection against proteolysis could be conferred not only by the existence of a rigid structure within the polypeptide chain bound to GroEL but also by direct protein-protein interaction between the substrate and the chaperonin in the regions of tighter binding, as well as by steric hindrance, due to the blocked location of the scissile substrate within the complex. In the case of the mAAT folding intermediate(s) bound to GroEL, our limited proteolysis study shows two main characteristics of the structure of the protein as part of the binary complex. First, the most accessible cleavage sites are all located at residues within the N-terminal half of the transaminase polypeptide chain, regardless of the specificity of the protease used and despite the presence of numerous other potential cleavage sites along the chain (42 cleavage sites, evenly distributed along the amino acid sequence of mAAT, for trypsin alone, Fig. 5). Second, there appears to be a specific pattern of proteolytic events, starting with cleavage in the stretch from Arg26 to Lys31 (region 1, Fig. 5), and continuing in a sequential fashion with hydrolysis occurring in regions 2–5. Time course experiments, performed to determine the order of formation and the relative stability of each intermediate fragment (data for trypsin and proteinase K are shown in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively), revealed that the region most exposed to proteolysis that produces relatively stable intermediates is located between Tyr48 (fragments CT2 and E2) and Arg54(T2) (see Fig. 5). Those are the first high molecular weight fragments to accumulate significantly. The species T1, produced by cleavage at position 26, is indeed observed, and it reaches a maximum amount slightly ahead of T2, 4J. R. Mattingly, Jr., A. Iriarte, and M. Martinez-Carrion, manuscript submitted for publication. but it does not accumulate as much as T2. No fragments of comparable size are detected with other proteases. Moreover, even though after 15 min incubation with trypsin the most prominent small peptide is the one complementary to T1 (T1c, eluting at 24.2 min, Fig. 3), at earlier time points we also detected the presence of the peptide complementary to T2 (T2c, residues 3–54), together with the two smaller fragments 3–26 and 27–54. These data indicate that the regions 1 and 2 are almost equally accessible, with slightly faster cleavage at region 1. Cleavage at region 2 does not require, however, previous cleavage at region 1, as the presence of both T1c and T2c complementary fragments at the early stage of proteolysis suggests. Further cleavage of T2c by trypsin (at Arg26) following its release from GroEL might explain the predominance of the 3–26 peptide (T1c) at later time points (Fig.3 A).As shown in Fig. 7 and TableIII, in the folded protein the cleavage site in region 1 which produces T1 lies roughly in the middle of the N-terminal portion of the small domain, at the end of an α-helix. In the folded protein this is the only region that is susceptible to trypsin (42Sandmeier E. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10284-10289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and only in harsh conditions. Evidently, this is also the region of greater accessibility and conformational flexibility in the folding intermediate bound to GroEL. Its unrestricted access to trypsin also suggests that region 1 is not involved in extensive interactions with the chaperonin. The residues comprising region 2, which is completely resistant to proteolysis in the native conformation, are located near the beginning of the large domain in what is a 12-residue α-helix in the native protein (Fig. 7). This region also includes residues at the intersubunit and domain interface in the folded protein (Table III), including a short segment in an extended conformation that crosses over between the two domains (Pro47 and Tyr48). It is obvious that this region is considerably more flexible in the folding intermediate bound to GroEL than in the native protein and does not represent a binding site for the chaperonin. The type 2 intermediates are relatively stable, and only a limited number of its potential cleavage sites are accessible for further proteolysis. Among these, regions 3 and 4 seem to have comparable accessibility as both types of fragments start to appear almost simultaneously (Fig. 4). Yet, the type 3 fragments do not accumulate much, probably because they are subsequently converted to type 4 species. The latter are the most stable species observed. Regions 3 and 4 are both located at the outside edge of a pack of α-helices and β-strands that form the core of the compact large domain in the native structure (Fig. 7), partly exposed but still resistant to proteolysis. Those two regions therefore appear to be less structured in the folding intermediate trapped by GroEL than in the native protein.Table IIILocation of the protease-accessible protein segments of mAAT bound to GroEL in the three-dimensional structure of native dimeric mAATRegionResiduesSecondary structureLocation1Arg26-Lys31α-Helix (Pro16-Arg26)Small domainβ-Turn (Asn29-Lys32)Exposed2Tyr48-Lys68α-Helix (Pro51-Gly62)Large domainβ-Turn (Ala61-Asn64)Subunit interface (Val49, Arg54, Glu57, Lys64 to Tyr70)3Phe79-Ala87α-Helix (Ala77-Leu88)Large domainPartially exposed4Leu95-Gln104α-Helix (Glu93-Ser97)Large domainβ-Turn (Leu95-Gly98)95–100, exposedβ-Strand (Arg99-Thr105)101–104, extends toward protein internal core5Val198-Trp205α-Helix (Pro202-Lys215)Large domain extended loop (Ala190-Pro200Gln199 at the domain interface Open table in a new tab Type 4 fragments are slowly degraded, but the major products detected (type 5) rapidly disappear. The only type 5 fragment we characterized (K5a) arises from cleavage at Asp199, at the domain interface (36McPhalen C.A. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 495-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This region appears to become accessible only after removal of the first 100 N-terminal residues. A possible explanation for the rapid degradation of the K5a fragment could be the loss of the protection afforded by GroEL if it were released from the complex. However, the K5a fragment remains bound to GroEL (data not shown). More likely, the increased instability of K5a is due to further unfolding or greater exposure of the C-terminal core (∼200 residues) following cleavage of the 106–199 segment from the relatively stable K4 fragment. Interestingly, no stable intermediates were detected originating from cleavage within this ∼100-residue region (106–190) that seems to stabilize K4. In the native dimer, this section is organized in alternating α-helix and β-strand (3 of each) elements in the middle of the compact α/β core of the large domain, with many of the residues contributing to the subunit or domain interfaces and even to the active site (36McPhalen C.A. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 495-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). By contrast, the 194–199 sequence forms a loop connecting the last β-strand of the previous region (strand A5, 184–190) with the next α-helix (helix 8, 202–215) (Fig.7). A similar arrangement of secondary structure elements in the GroEL-bound intermediate would explain the preferential cleavage after Asp199 in K4.Taken together our results suggest that the folding domains revealed by the pattern of protease-susceptible and -resistant regions observed in the mAAT polypeptide bound to GroEL might be related to the structural organization of the native protein. The regions with greatest accessibility and conformational flexibility are located either at the N-terminal peptide, which forms an exposed bridge between the two subunits in the native structure (region 1), or at the N-terminal edge of the α/β ensemble that forms the compact large domain (regions 2–4, Fig. 7). The sections forming the central core of the large domain and the C-terminal portion of the small domain in the native protein, together comprising over 70% of the polypeptide, are largely resistant to proteolysis and probably much more structured. The fact that the only other cleavage site identified (region 5) is in a loop at the domain interface (Fig. 7) might indicate that the docking of the two domains in the intermediate is still incomplete.Some of the protease protection observed in mAAT bound to GroEL could be due to the binding to the chaperonin or by the intrinsic structural rigidity of the resistant fragments. However, the trypsinolysis pattern of mAAT at the early stages of refolding in the absence of GroEL is qualitatively identical to that of the complex with the chaperonin.4 Thus, the structural organization of the protein bound to GroEL appears to be an intrinsic property of the folding intermediate and not the result of its binding to the chaperonin. Binding to GroEL, however, confers some retardation to proteolysis either by limited steric interference to access of the protease or by locking the fluctuating conformation of the folding intermediate into one of the more protease-resistant conformations. Although these data do not support a clear model for the binding of mAAT to GroEL, they are most compatible with the location of the more compact C-terminal part in the central cavity of GroEL and the N-terminal portion exposed at the mouth of the cavity or perhaps extending even beyond the external opening of the cavity. The significant amount of exposure to proteases nevertheless precludes a model in which the protein is fully immersed into the GroEL central cavity. The size of the cylindrical cavity in resting GroEL (∼45 Å) (8Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachiniak A. Horwich A.L. Siegler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) is unlikely to accommodate a folding intermediate the size of (partially unfolded) mAAT but could probably accept the compact C-terminal half. The more flexible N-terminal region could engage in interactions with residues near the opening of the cavity and between the apical domains (11Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L.

The observation that mAAT-HT, having a His6-tag at the C-terminal end, is not retained by a Ni2+-NTA column when bound to GroEL (free native protein binds tightly, data not shown) supports the proposed location of the C-terminal section buried inside the complex. The sudden increase in protease accessibility of 200-residue C-terminal fragments (type 5) as time of proteolysis increases supports the perception that the N-terminal region originally forms a protective barrier between the exogenous protease and the C-terminal half of the bound protein. Changes in the intrinsic structure of the fragment brought about by the previous successive cleavages may also contribute to the instability of the type 5 fragments.Despite the highly restricted access of the polypeptide bound to GroEL to proteases, the reactivity of the seven cysteine residues in GroEL-bound mAAT is"
https://openalex.org/W2054477217,"This paper reports that the aggregation state of a membrane protein can be changed reversibly without the use of chaotropic agents or denaturants by altering the attractive interactions between micelles of polyethylene glycol-based detergents. This has been documented using mannitol permease of Escherichia coli (EIImtl), a protein whose activity is dependent on the dimerization of its membrane-embedded domains. We show that the driving force for the hydrophobic interactions responsible for the dimerization can be decreased by bringing the protein into a less polar environment. This can be done simply and reversibly by increasing the micelle cluster size of the solubilizing detergent since the micropolarity in the micelle decreases upon clustering and is directly related to the cluster size.The micelle cluster size was varied at a fixed temperature by adding sodium phosphate or a second detergent with a distinct clustering behavior, and the changes were quantified by quasi-elastic light scattering and by determining the cloud point or demixing temperature (Td) of the detergent. Maximal EIImtlactivity was found when no micelle clustering occurred, but the activity gradually decreased down to 5% of the maximal activity with increasing cluster size. The inactivation was found to be completely reversible. The kinetics of heterodimer formation were also significantly affected by changes in the micelle cluster size as expected. Increasing the cluster size resulted in faster formation of functional heterodimers by increasing the rate of homodimer dissociation. This phenomenon should be generally applicable to controlling the oligomeric state of membrane-bound proteins or even water-soluble proteins if their subunit association is dominated by hydrophobic forces.

In principle, this decrease in micropolarity should be able to be used to transfer a membrane protein, solubilized by such a detergent, to a less polar environment. Only PEG-based detergents show this clustering behavior. It can be induced by heating where, at a certain temperature, the cloud point or demixing temperature (Td), the cluster size reaches a value which initiates separation of the micellar phase into two new micellar phases, one consisting of the micellar clusters and one containing a low concentration of micelles (2Zulauf M. Michel H. Crystallization of Membrane Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 53-72Google Scholar). Phase separation or demixing of PEG-based detergents into two new micellar phases atTd upon heating has been studied in detail with various techniques such as light, neutron and x-ray scattering, viscosity measurements, and NMR spin lattice relaxation (2Zulauf M. Michel H. Crystallization of Membrane Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 53-72Google Scholar, 4Corti M. Degiorgio V. J. Phys.

Waring L. Bostock T. McDonald M.P. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1. 1983; 79: 975-1000Crossref Google Scholar). Such studies suggest that the intermicellar forces become stronger upon heating due to a decrease of the hydration of the PEG chains. This leads to stronger van der Waals interactions between the micelles and the formation of micelle clusters. It is believed that the size of the micelle does not change upon heating (7Zulauf M. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Phys. Chem. 1983; 87: 856-862Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but the size of the clusters increases asymtotically and follows a power-law given by (Td − T)/Td (4Corti M. Degiorgio V. J. Phys. Chem. 1981; 85: 1442-1445Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Corti M. Degiorgio V. Zulauf M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1982; 48: 1617-1620Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The attractive forces between micelles can also be increased at a fixed temperature, T, by the addition of certain inorganic salts, especially phosphate or fluoride salts, or by mixing with a detergent with a lower Td (2Zulauf M. Michel H. Crystallization of Membrane Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 53-72Google Scholar). Whether one increasesT or lowers Td, the result in the same, the interval Td − T decreases, and as the two approach one another, the micelle cluster size increases until, at T = Td, phase separation occurs. This demixing property has been used in biochemical studies to separate hydrophobic proteins from more hydrophilic ones (9Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrophobic proteins concentrate in the detergent-rich phase upon heating the detergent solution above Td. After centrifugation, this phase can be easily separated from the aqueous phase, containing the hydrophilic proteins. Triton X-114 with Td = 22 °C is often used in such procedures. Here we demonstrate that these same intermicellar attractive forces can be used in a more subtle way to disrupt the hydrophobic forces responsible for subunit interactions and thereby reversibly control the association state of EIImtl in PEG-based detergents. EIImtl is inactive as a monomer and phophorylates mannitol when in the dimeric state. Hydrophobic forces are involved in the dimerization process (10Lolkema J.S. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10120-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both the activity of EIImtl and the rate of formation of EIImtl heterodimers can be controlled by choosing a specific micellar cluster size. The results are explained by relating the decrease in micropolarity of the micelles upon clustering with the decrease in the driving force for hydrophobic bonding, the interactions responsible for EIImtldimerization. dPEG, C10E6, C10E5, and C10E4 were supplied by B. Kwant (Kwant High Vacuum Oil Recycling and Synthesis, Bedum, The Netherlands). dMal was from Sigma. Na3PO4 solutions were adjusted to pH = 7.6 with concentrated H3PO4. Q-Sepharose Fast Flow and S-Sepharose Fast Flow were from Pharmacia (Sweden); hexyl-agarose was from Sigma.d-[1-3H]Mannitol (976.8 GBq/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. EI and HPr were purified as described previously (11Dooijewaard G. Roossien F.F. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2990-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Robillard G.T.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8164-8171Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All other reagents were analytical grade. The purification of EIImtl was as described previously for EIImtl(C384S) (14Pas H.H. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 28: 5520-5525Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The PEP-dependent mannitol phosphorylation activity of EIImtl was measured as described (15Robillard G.T. Blaauw M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5796-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The assay buffer contained 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm PEP, 0.25% (v/v) detergent, 20 μm HPr, and 0.33 μm EI. The reaction was started with 60 μm[3H]mannitol (1 mm for the experiments presented in Fig. 2). Concentrated stock solutions (1–2 μm) of EIImtl were used, which were diluted 1,000-fold when the enzyme was assayed. Therefore, the influence of the dPEG (Td = 58 °C) in this stock solution during the assay conditions can be neglected. All reactions were performed at 30 °C in buffers with Td > 30 °C. Changes in Td (and thus Rh) are known to occur abruptly (7Zulauf M. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Phys. Chem. 1983; 87: 856-862Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar) as was checked under the conditions used in this study. The EIImtl concentrations were determined by flow dialysis which quantitates the number of mannitol binding sites (16Lolkema J.S. Dijkstra D.S. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10659-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), assuming one high affinity binding site (KD ∼100 nm) per EIImtl dimer in accordance with the observations of Pas et al. (14Pas H.H. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 28: 5520-5525Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Light scattering experiments were performed at 30 °C by using a DynaPro-801TC instrument (Protein Solutions Inc., Charlottesville, VA), equipped with a thermostated cell. Detergent (0.25%, v/v) was dissolved in 25 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm PEP. In one case, 0.5% dPEG was used since no stable signal at 0.25% was observed. Solutions were filtered through 0.1 μm Anotop10 filters (Whatman). Data were analyzed using the software supplied by the manufacturer. Data could be resolved by the theoretical single exponential autocorrelation function (monomodal analysis), indicating that the solutions were monodisperse. Each sample was measured at least seven times. Standard deviations in Rh were 0.1 nm or less. Cloud points (± 0.5 °C) were determined by heating a detergent solution in a test tube with a thermometer. Micelles clustering is reflected in an increase in the apparent hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of the micelle, and this occurs as the temperature of the solution approaches the cloud point (Td). The phosphorylation activity of EIImtl has been determined at 30 °C in PEG-based detergent mixtures with various cloud points, and the apparent hydrodynamic radii of the micelle clusters of these solutions under the assay conditions has been determined by quasi-elastic light scattering experiments. The Td of PEG-based detergents was lowered by increasing the concentration of sodium phosphate. Addition of up to 250 mmNa3PO4 (pH = 7.6) lowered theTd of dPEG from 58 to 33 °C with a corresponding increase in Rh from 3.4 to 8.2 nm (Fig.1 A, ○). A plot of the enzyme activity against Rh shows that increased values of Rh result in a lowering of the enzyme activity down to 10% of the activity found in dPEG with Rh = 3.4 nm (Fig. 1 A, •). The activity in the latter buffer corresponds with the highest specific activity found for EIImtl solubilized in a detergent (2000–3000 nm/min/nm enzyme when assayed with 60 μm mannitol). Increasing the dPEG concentration from 0.25 to 1% at 200 mm Na3PO4 did not change the EIImtl activity (not shown). Fig. 1 Bshows that the sensitivity of the EIImtl activity to a change in Td was not only observed in the polydisperse detergent, dPEG, but also in the monodisperse PEG-based detergent, C10E5. The activity of EIImtl in buffer containing pure C10E5 (Td = 44 °C) was the same as that found in dPEG with Td = 58 °C (17Swaving Dijkstra D. Broos J. Lolkema J.S. Enequist H. Minke W. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6628-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Lowering the Td via the introduction of Na3PO4 again resulted in increased values of Rh and a lowering of the EIImtlactivity. Finally, the Td of these solutions could also be changed by mixing with another PEG-based detergent with a different Td rather than with Na3PO4. Fig. 1 C shows that mixing C10E5 (Td = 44 °C) with C10E4 (Td = 16 °C) also resulted in an increase in Rh and a decrease in EIImtl activity. The decreasing EIImtl activity with increasingRh should be reflecting the change in oligomerization state of EIImtl from active dimers into less active or inactive monomers. This is supported by the behavior of the specific activity of EIImtl as a function of the enzyme concentration in buffer containing detergent with high (Fig.2,) ○) and low (•)Td. These experiments were performed underVmax conditions (1 mm mannitol instead of 60 μm), which allowed the enzyme to be assayed between 0.05 and 50 nm at a single mannitol concentration. In dPEG with a Td = 58 °C (Fig. 2, ○), an activity of ± 4000 nm/min/nm enzyme was found that was constant between 0.05–5 nmEIImtl. In dPEG buffer with 200 mmNa3PO4 (Td = 35 °C) (Fig.2, •), the specific activity increased from less than 670 nm/min/nm enzyme at 0.05 nm enzyme to 2000 nm/min/nm enzyme at 50 nmEIImtl, confirming that lowering the Td results in dissociation of active dimers into less active or inactive monomers. Increasing the EIImtl concentration shifts, by mass action, the equilibrium back to the active, dimeric form. The reversibility of the change in association state upon a change in Td has been demonstrated in C10E5 buffer. EIImtl (0.8 nm) was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 120 mm Na3PO4(Td = 34 °C) to cause the protein to dissociate. One portion of this solution was then diluted 10-fold with assay buffer containing the same Na3PO4 concentration while another portion was diluted with assay buffer lacking Na3PO4. After 10 min at 30 °C, the phosphorylation reaction was started by adding 60 μmmannitol. As expected, a low activity (240 nm/min/nm enzyme) was found for the enzyme incubated with buffer containing 120 mmNa3PO4 and diluted into the same buffer. A high activity (2055 nm/min/nm enzyme) was observed for the enzyme incubated with buffer containing 120 mmNa3PO4 but then diluted with the low salt buffer. The same high activity was measured for the control enzyme that had not been exposed to high Na3PO4 in the incubation or dilution phase. Therefore, the effect of a variation in Td on the activity of EIImtl is completely reversible. Fig. 3 presents the effect of a rapid change in Td on the EIImtl activity. The enzyme was preincubated in a dPEG buffer with highTd (58 °C) along with PEP, E1, and HPr to generate phosphorylated EIImtl (P-EIImtl) and then diluted into buffers with mannitol and dPEG with the same or lowerTd. The control (Fig. 3, •) diluted into dPEG buffer with a Td of 58 °C showed a rapid linear increase of mtl-P with time. But when the samples were diluted into dPEG buffers with a lower Td, the time dependence showed two phases. (i) In the first 4–5 min, the specific activity gradually decreases. (ii) After 5 min, the specific activity was stable, the lower the Td then the lower the activity. Since the new Td values were reached immediately after mixing (see “Experimental Procedures”), these phases most likely reflect the time-dependent changes in the association state of the enzyme. During the first phase, the concentration of monomer in solutions with lower Td increases until a new monomer-dimer equilibrium establishes itself. After 5 min, the new equilibrium is established, and the rates are linear with time. The results presented so far show a reversible dissociation of active EIImtl dimers into less active monomers upon increasing Rh or correspondingly decreasing Td. In the next section, the effect of variation of Td on the formation of heterodimers will be presented. The influence of micelle cluster size on the kinetics of heterodimer formation of EIImtl has been studied by using two EIImtl mutants, each of which lack PEP-dependent activity but become active upon formation of a heterodimer (complementation assay, see Fig.4, inset). One such couple is EIImtl (G196D), with drastically reduced binding affinity for mannitol, and IICmtl, 2When domains are covalently linked, we refer to them as the A, B, and C domain, and when they are produced separately, we refer to them as IIAmtl, IIBmtl, and IICmtl. which is inactive by virtue of the missing A and B domains (18Boer H. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12901-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Upon formation of a heterodimer, the phosphoryl group can proceed from PEP via HPr and E1 and the A and B domains of EIImtl to mannitol bound in the C domain (see “Discussion”). Fig. 4 follows the rate of appearance of phosphorylation activity when these two enzymes are incubated in detergent of varying Td. EIImtl (G196D) and IICmtl were incubated for 10 min in phosphorylation buffer with dPEG and various concentrations of Na3PO4 shifting the Td between 58 and 35 °C (Rh = 3.4–7.3 nm). The reaction was started with mannitol, and the accumulation of mannitol-1-phosphate over time was monitored. In detergent solutions with a high Td (58 °C), a slow initial activity was observed that gradually increased in time and then became constant (Fig. 4, •). When the Td was decreased, initial activities increased, resulting in faster attainment of a constant PEP-dependent phosphorylation activity (○). In a detergent solution with a Td of 35 °C, a high and constant activity was observed immediately (Fig. 4, ×). These results suggest a more rapid formation of functional heterodimers from inactive homodimers in detergent solutions with a lowerTd. The following experiments were performed to examine the formation of heterodimers in more detail (Fig. 5). EIImtl (G196D) and IICmtl were incubated for 10 min in buffer containing 25 mmNa3PO4, 5 mm DTT, and 0.25% dPEG (Td = 58 °C). This solution was diluted 20-fold in the same buffer that now contained 5 mmMgCl2 and 5 mm PEP, 0.33 μm EI, and 20 μm HPr for an additional 5 min to generate P-EIImtl. Upon addition of mannitol, a low initial activity was found, which gradually increased with time (Fig. 5 A, •). But if the initial solution was diluted in buffer with high Na3PO4 to produce a low Td (37 °C), maximal phosphorylation activity was observed immediately (Fig. 5 A, ×). Similarly, if the incubation was performed under low Td conditions and the assay at either high or low Td conditions, maximal initial activity was found immediately (Fig. 5 A, ○ and ▪, respectively). Therefore, as long as both enzymes have been incubated with each other under low Td conditions, formation of heterodimers is complete within the 5-min incubation period and does not reverse when the Td is subsequently increased. Although more inactive monomers are expected in detergent solutions with a lowTd (Figs. 1 and 3), the high protein concentration used in these experiments will result in high heterodimer concentrations. These experiments show that formation of heterodimers is very fast when the Td of the buffer is low; moreover, the specific activity of the heterodimer is not affected at high enzyme concentrations when the Td is varied between 37 and 63 °C (Rh = 6.4–3.4). Incubation of EIImtl with mannitol has been reported to stimulate the dissociation of EIImtl dimers (19Stephan M.M. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and could also be expected to stimulate heterodimer formation. To test this, EIImtl (G196D) and IICmtl were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in assay buffer with dPEG (Td = 58 °C) that included PEP, EI, and HPr. Upon starting the reaction with mannitol, a low initial activity was found (Fig. 5 B, •). However, when mannitol replaced PEP in the incubation step and the reaction was started with PEP, maximal activity was found almost immediately, indicating that formation of heterodimer was nearly completed at the moment that PEP was added (Fig. 5 B, ○). When both PEP and mannitol were omitted during the incubation of the two enzymes, and the reaction was started with these two components, a similar pattern was found as when the reaction was started with mannitol (Fig. 5 B, ×). The similarity in activity profiles of • and × shows that prior phosphorylation of EIImtl does not affect the process of heterodimer formation as probed under the conditions used. Finally, we have investigated the formation of heterodimers in n-decyl β-d-maltopyranoside (dMal), a detergent which does not form micelle clusters and experience phase separation. The specific activity of EIImtl in 3 mm dMal is the same as when the enzyme is solubilized in 0.25% dPEG (Td = 58 °C) or C10E5 (Td = 44 °C), detergents in which maximal EIImtl activity is observed. EIImtl (G196D) (20 nm) and IICmtl(145 nm) were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C in assay buffer containing 0.25% dPEG and 140 mmNa3PO4 (Td = 44 °C) (•), 3 mm dMal (○), 6 mm dMal (×), or 6 mm dMal and 140 mmNa3PO4 (▪), and the phosphorylation assay was started with mannitol (Fig. 6). While a high activity was observed in dPEG, replacement of this detergent by dMal results in an 8–16 times lower activity, indicating that heterodimer formation was strongly suppressed in dMal presumably via suppression of homodimer dissociation. Numerous papers have been dedicated to study the kinetics of mannitol translocation and phosphorylation of Escherichia coli, EIImtl (20Lolkema J.S. Robillard G.T. New Compr.

While some work was carried out on proteoliposomes of EIImtl, most of these studies have been performed while the enzyme was solubilized by a PEG-based detergent, especially Lubrol PX and dPEG. EIImtl has been observed both as a monomer and a dimer (19Stephan M.M. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Pas H.H. Ellory J.C. Robillard G.T.

Mutants of EIImtl, each inactive by virtue of a mutation in the A, B, or C domain, could be reactivated by mixing with another mutant form carrying the mutation on another domain (see Fig. 4, inset). Apparently, the phosphoryl group can cross the dimer interface when proceeding from the A domain, via the B domain, to mannitol bound at the C domain. The following evidence indicates that an increased tendency of the micelles to form clusters (high Rh conditions) induces monomerization of EIImtl dimers. 1) A lowering of the EIImtl activity was observed with increasingRh. 2). The specific activity of EIImtl, under conditions of high Rh, increased with increasing enzyme concentration. A higher percentage of (active) dimers is expected upon an increase in enzyme concentration, due to mass action. Under conditions of minimal Rh (maximalTd), maximum activity was observed at all EIImtl concentrations monitored, indicative of a completely dimeric enzyme. The increase of specific activity which Boer et al. (27Boer H. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Dijkstra A. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17863-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). observed upon addition of high concentrations of IICmtl to active EIImtl can also be explained in these terms; a population of EIImtl monomers were present under their specific detergent conditions, which were titrated by high concentrations of IICmtl to form active heterodimers. 3) The rates of heterodimer formation, from two homodimers, were significantly increased under conditions of highRh due to the increased rate of dissociation of the homodimers. In line with this, the kinetics of heterodimer formation were also increased by the introduction of mannitol, a substrate known to dissociate EIImtl (19Stephan M.M. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The relationship between the EIImtl activity and theTd of dPEG or C10E5 was found to be similar, whether the lowering of Td was caused by C10E4 or Na3PO4 (Fig. 1). This, and the observation that the EIImtl activity at low Td can be completely converted to the high activity found in buffer with a highTd, supports the view that the enzyme is sensitive to changes in the micellar properties rather than the chemical composition of the detergent. EIImtl exhibits maximal activity when solubilized in dPEG, C10E5, or C10E6 (not shown). The micellar size of dPEG (Td = 58 °C), C10E5(Td = 44 °C), and C10E6(Td = 62 °C) at 30 °C, where almost no clustering of micelles is expected, differs significantly (Rh is 3.4 nm, 4.9 nm, and 2.9 nm, respectively). Apparently, the size of the micelle is not important for the monomer to dimer equilibrium. The concentration of micelles is 4 orders of magnitude higher than the enzyme concentration used in these experiments. Clustering of micelles, including the ones containing EIImtl, will result in partial solvation of the EIImtl-detergent micelles by other detergent micelles instead of by bulk water. This shift in solvation is expected to increase with increasing micelle cluster size. Since hydrophobic forces are involved in the formation of the EIImtl dimer (10Lolkema J.S. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10120-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Stephan M.M. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the shift to a more hydrophobic environment most likely explains the dissociation of dimers. Recently, Boer et al. (18Boer H. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12901-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). demonstrated that the simultaneous expression of EIImtl (G196D) and IICmtl in E. coli. resulted in cells that were able to take up mannitol. No mannitol uptake was observed if the mutants were expressed separately. This experiment showed that heterodimer formation between EIImtl (G196D) and IICmtl occurs in vivo. Heterodimer formation also proceeds in dPEG and C10E5 and is facilitated by an increase of Rh (decrease in Td). Almost no heterodimer formation was found in dMal although the wild-type enzyme is highly active when solubilized in this detergent. Therefore, PEG-based detergents are probably the best class of detergents for mechanistic investigations on EIImtl since the activity is comparable with the activity for EIImtl in vesicles (31Lolkema J.S. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17844-17849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and heterodimer formation is readily achieved in these detergents. In conclusion, a “new” detergent parameter relevant for membrane protein chemistry, i.e. the tendency of micelles to cluster, has been shown to control the oligomerization state of EIImtl. Proper control of this variable can result in almost complete monomerization or dimerization of the protein. It provides a unique tool to study mechanistic aspects of membrane protein oligomerization. We thank B. Kwant for supplying the various detergents used in this study, T. Pijning for assistance in the light scattering experiments, and M. G. Sonetti for the purification of EIImtl."

To explore the possibility of enhancing the affinity of a TF-based antagonist for FVIIa, we created libraries in which residues at 20, 58, and adjacent positions were varied in constructs containing the soluble extracellular domain of TF (sTF) fused to the bacteriophage M13 tail coat protein. TF variants monovalently displayed on phage were then sorted on the basis of binding to FVIIa. Sorting of preliminary libraries, in which position 58 and/or 20 and surrounding residues were randomized, led to the selection of TF proteins of essentially wild-type sequence. Therefore, we devised a strategy wherein TF position 20 was held fixed as alanine and 5 specific residues near to, and including, position 58 were randomized to effectively obtain alternative sequences at this interface. The consensus sequence reached with this library included wild-type residues at positions 61, 62, 65, and 66 but exclusively tryptophan at position 58. Analyses of the soluble K20A,D58W (A20W58) TF protein indicated that it binds FVIIa with an affinity comparable with wild-type sTF but is defective as a cofactor for FVIIa-dependent factor X activation. Further experiments designed to elucidate the mechanism of binding suggest that the new binding interactions involve more than the simple addition of hydrophobic surface area.

The extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is triggered by the formation of a complex between factor VIIa (FVIIa) 1The abbreviations used are: FVIIa, coagulation factor VIIa; TF, tissue factor; FX and FXa, zymogen and activated coagulation factor X, respectively; sTF, the soluble extracellular domain of TF, residues 1–219; hTFAA, the sTF variant containing Lys to Ala substitutions at positions 165 and 166; A20W58, the sTF variant containing K20A and D58W substitutions; BEGR-CK, biotinylated Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone; BEGR-7a, biotinylated active site-inhibited FVIIa; EGF-1, the first epidermal growth factor-like domain of FVIIa. and its obligate, membrane-bound cofactor, tissue factor (TF). TF·FVIIa-mediated activation of factor X (FX) to factor Xa (FXa) and of factor IX to factor IXa leads to thrombin production and ultimately to fibrin clot formation at sites of vascular injury (1Nemerson Y. Blood. 1988; 71: 1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ruf W. Edgington T.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 385Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 3Davie E.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Aberrant TF expression has been linked to the pathophysiological conditions associated with sepsis and thrombotic disorders (4Broze Jr., G.J. Bloom A.L. Forbes C.D. Thomas D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. Haemostasis and Thrombosis. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, United Kingdom1994: 349-377Google Scholar). Treatment of these diseases may be possible through the development of potent anticoagulants that modulate TF·FVIIa complex formation. We have recently tested the antithrombotic properties of a mutant of the soluble extracellular domain of TF (sTF, residues 1–219) (5Kelley R.F. Refino C.J. O'Connell M.P. Modi N. Sehl P. Lowe D. Pater C. Bunting S. Blood. 1997; 89: 3219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of alanines in place of lysines at positions 165 and 166 (Fig. 1 A) yields an sTF variant (hTFAA) that binds FVIIa with an affinity equivalent to wild-type sTF but is defective as a cofactor for FX activation (6Roy S. Hass P.E. Bourell J.H. Henzel W.J. Vehar G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol.

The hTFAA variant inhibits the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation in vitro through competition with membrane TF for binding to FVIIa. In a rabbit model of arterial thrombosis, hTFAA partially blocks thrombus formation without increasing bleeding tendency. However, high doses of hTFAA are required for the antithrombotic effect, in part because FVIIa binds to cell surface TF approximately 1000-fold more tightly than to sTF (10Waxman E. Ross J.B.A. Laue T.M. Guha A. Thiruvikraman S.V. Lin T.C. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The greater apparent affinity is due to interaction of the FVIIa Gla-containing domain with phospholipid. One approach to create a more potent version of hTFAA is to introduce amino acid substitutions at FVIIa-binding interfaces that increase the cofactor's affinity for its ligand. The structure of FVIIa in complex with sTF has been recently determined at 2.0-Å resolution by x-ray crystallography (11Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). An extensive interface is formed between sTF and FVIIa, resulting in the burial of 3620 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area. Scanning mutagenesis of TF has shown that Lys20 and Asp58 make dominant contributions to FVIIa binding (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Ruf W. Schullek J.R. Stone M.J. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), with alanine substitutions at these positions leading to 78- and 30-fold reductions in FVIIa affinity, respectively (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Lys20 and Asp58 are on adjacent antiparallel β-strands (13Muller Y.A. Ultsch M.H. Kelley R.F. deVos A.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10864Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 14Harlos K. Martin D.M.A. O'Brien D.P. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Polikarpov I. Miller A. Tuddenham E.G.D. Boys C.W.G. Nature. 1994; 370: 662Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), forming part of a functional epitope that binds to the amino-terminal epidermal growth factor-like domain (EGF-1) of FVIIa via both hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions (Ref. 11Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar; Fig.1 B). Previous work on the affinity maturation of human growth hormone (15Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) demonstrated that affinity improvements were obtained from changes at residues that were important for binding based on scanning mutagenesis studies. We reasoned, therefore, that randomizing codons for positions 20 and 58 and adjacent residues would allow us to remodel this interface with the goal of increasing TF affinity for FVIIa. Our implementation of this strategy involved the monovalent display of large combinatorial libraries of sTF variants as fusions to the gene III product of filamentous bacteriophage M13 and selection of tight binders by panning sTF-phage versus immobilized FVIIa. Coagulation factors VIIa, X, and Xa used in chromogenic assays, as well as biotinylated glutamyl-glycyl-arginine chloromethyl ketone (BEGR-CK), were purchased from Hematological Technologies. Chromogenic substrates Chromozym t-PA (N-methylsulfonyl-d-phenyl-l-glycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide acetate) and Spectrozyme FXa (methoxycarbonyl-d-cyclohexylglycyl-l-glycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide acetate) were from Boehringer Mannheim and American Diagnostica, respectively. Substrates S-2266 (d-valyl-l-leucyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride), S-2288 (H-d-isoleucyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride), and S-2366 (l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride) were from Pharmacia Hepar. Phagemids encoding sTF fused to the carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 249–406) of the M13 gene III product were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) from a vector, phGH-g3, previously developed for monovalent phage display (17Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Simpson N. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10832Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 18Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. Methods. 1991; 3: 205Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One phagemid, called pTFAA-g3, encodes the sTF variant containing Lys to Ala substitutions at positions 165 and 166 and was used as the starting template for mutagenesis in preparation for library constructions. A second phagemid, pTF-g3, encodes wild-type sTF and was mutated to create the gene encoding the K20A and D58W substitutions in an otherwise wild-type protein. In preparation for library constructions, oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis (19Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) was performed on phagemid pTFAA-g3 to create DNA templates that encode hTFAA variants with markedly lower affinity for FVIIa. Mutant libraries were then created by substituting five TF codons simultaneously with NNS nucleotide sequences (where N represents G, A, T, or C and S represents G or C) via oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the appropriately altered pTFAA-g3 template. This strategy ensured that phage incorporating TF encoded from the template DNA would be less likely to compete with library-derived phage for FVIIa binding should the mutagenic efficiency be suboptimal. Specifically, for libraries 1 and 3 the template phagemid encoded a Lys to Ala substitution at residue 20 (K20A) and an Asp to Glu substitution at position 58 (D58E), 2The D58E change leads to an sTF protein with 10-fold lower affinity for FVIIa compared with the wild-type cofactor (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Additionally, the sTF variant bearing both K20A and D58E substitutions has no detectable binding to BEGR7a immobilized on a BIAcore flow cell (R. Kelley, unpublished observation). in addition to the Lys to Ala substitutions at positions 165 and 166. For library 2, the starting template encoded the three Lys to Ala substitutions but retained the wild-type Asp58 codon. For the construction of library 1, two primers were used to simultaneously mutate codons at positions 20 and 21 and at positions 54, 56, and 58, respectively, in the pTFAA (K20A,D58E)-g3 template. Library 2 used pTFAA (K20A)-g3 as template with randomization of codons 15, 17, 20, 22, and 24. A restriction site selection protocol was used to enrich for mutant sequences. In library 3, the mutation encoding K20A in the pTFAA (K20A,D58E)-g3 template was left untouched, while five triplets encoding positions 58, 61, 62, 65, and 66 were altered. The preparation of filamentous phage displaying sTF variants, by electroporation of phagemid libraries into Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and subsequent infection of bacteria with helper phage VCS M13 (Stratagene), was performed as described by Lowman and Wells (18Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. Methods. 1991; 3: 205Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At least 10 clones from each of the unselected libraries were sequenced to ascertain the mutagenic efficiency. Library 1 contained 1 × 108 transformants with about 10% of the clones having both sites mutated. Library 2 had only 1 × 106transformants but a 100% mutation frequency as a result of the restriction site selection. Library 3 comprised 1 × 107 transformants with a 10% mutation frequency. Phage particles displaying TF variants were sorted on the basis of binding to biotinylated FVIIa (BEGR-7a). BEGR-7a was prepared using a biotinylated tripeptide chloromethyl ketone (BEGR-CK) active site inhibitor as described elsewhere (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Microtiter plate wells coated with streptavidin (Molecular Probes) and blocked with milk proteins were used to capture BEGR-7a. For selection experiments, phage displaying libraries of TF variants, in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 (TNC), were incubated in wells containing either streptavidin with BEGR-7a or streptavidin alone. After 1–2 h of incubation at ambient temperature, unbound phage were removed, and the wells were washed extensively with TNC buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20. Bound phage were then eluted using 50 mm EDTA in a 10-min incubation at 37 °C. The titer of infective TF-containing phage particles eluted from the wells was determined by infecting XL1 cells with eluted phage, streaking dilutions to LB plates containing ampicillin (to select for cells bearing TF-encoding phagemids), and counting colony-forming units. The ratio of the phage titer (colony-forming units/ml of elution buffer) from wells containing FVIIa to the titer eluted from wells containing streptavidin alone was calculated to monitor per round enrichments in specific binding. The gene encoding the A20W58 sTF variant was produced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis on pTF-g3, using separate primers to effect mutations leading to the K20A and D58W substitutions. The introduction of appropriate mutations was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar). The sTF variant, produced in nonsuppressor E. coli strain 27C7, was purified from periplasmic shockates using immunoaffinity chromatography (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Purified preparations of A20W58 were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining to quantify purity and subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry to verify appropriate molecular composition. The material routinely appeared to be ≥95% homogeneous (data not shown) and of the correct mass for the fully oxidized species (predicted mass, 25027; observed mass, 25027 ± 3). The concentrations of sTF-A20W58 preparations were determined on the basis of initial rates of binding to monoclonal antibody D3, under mass transfer-limiting conditions, using a Pharmacia BIAcore instrument and a preparation of wild-type sTF of known concentration as a standard (21Lee G.F. Lazarus R.A. Kelley R.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For kinetic determinations, peptide hydrolysis by TF·FVIIa was monitored by incubating 100 nm sTF with 100 nm FVIIa in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 (HNC) plus 0.01% Tween 20 for 0.5 h at ambient temperature and then adding chromogenic substrate to final concentrations in the range of 0.03–4 mm. The rate of change of absorbance at 405 nm was converted to mol of substrate cleaved using the equation ε0 = 10.5 mm−1 cm−1 forp-nitroaniline. Apparent equilibrium inhibition constants ( Ki*) of Kunitz domains, TF7I-C (22Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and IV-49C (23Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were determined by performing assays in which 20 nm sTF was incubated with a 5-fold excess of FVIIa and varying inhibitor concentrations in HNC plus Tween and then adding substrate Chromozym t-PA to a 2 mm final concentration. Ki* values were determined by nonlinear regression fitting of the relative initial velocityversus inhibitor concentration data to an equation developed for tightly binding inhibitors (24Bieth J. Fritz H. Tschesche H. Greene L.J. Truscheit E. Proteinase Inhibitors. Springer-Verlag, New York1974: 463-469Google Scholar, 25Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Conversion of zymogen to activated factor X by TF·FVIIa was measured in a two-stage chromogenic assay. In one microtiter plate, 1 nm sTF was pre-equilibrated at ambient temperature with 50 nm FVIIa and 500 μm vesicles composed of 70% phosphatidylcholine, 30% phosphatidylserine (26Bach R. Gentry R. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) in HNC containing 0.1% PEG-8000. FX was then added to concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 5 μm. At intervals after the FX addition, samples of the reaction mixture were quenched with an equal volume of 50 mm EDTA, pH 8, in a second plate and then assayed for FXa activity in the buffer above, containing 25 mm EDTA instead of CaCl2, by adding Spectrozyme-FXa to a 0.5 mm concentration. Reactions performed as above, but in the absence of FX, were used to define background proteolytic rates. Substrate cleavage rates were converted to mol of FXa produced via standard curves prepared using purified FXa. Rates of FX activation were determined by linear regression analysis from plots of mol of FXa produced over the assay time course. The affinities of wild-type and A20W58 sTF for immobilized FVIIa were determined by surface plasmon resonance measurements on a Pharmacia BIAcore instrument as described previously (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), with the exception of using Neutravidin (Pierce) in place of streptavidin as the reagent for capturing BEGR-7a to the flow cell surface. There was no detectable binding of sTF proteins to a flow cell coated with Neutravidin alone. Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed to determine enthalpy changes and dissociation constants for wild-type and A20W58 sTF binding to FVIIa (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), using FVIIa at a 5 μm concentration in the calorimeter cell and titrating by injecting aliquots of 92 μm sTF. Enthalpy measurements made at 25, 30, and 35 °C were used to obtain an estimate forΔCp (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The thermal stability of sTF proteins, exhaustively dialyzed into TNC, was monitored by differential scanning calorimetry between 15 and 95 °C using a Microcal MC-2 scanning calorimeter. Melting temperatures of 54 and 49 °C were determined for the wild-type and A20W58 sTF proteins, respectively, indicating that the introduced substitutions do not substantially destabilize the TF variant. We wanted to test whether monovalent phage display of sTF would allow us to remodel a FVIIa binding epitope with the goal of increasing TF affinity for FVIIa. We chose to construct libraries in which 5 residues were randomized, with a potential diversity of 3.2 × 106 amino acid sequences, since this library size can be fully represented using current methods for transformation of E. coli. Positions 20 and 58 were included in the initial libraries because previous work with human growth hormone showed that affinity improvements resulted from changes at sites that had significant roles in binding based on alanine scanning (15Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Other residues were chosen for randomization because mutations at these sites result in modest effects on FVIIa binding (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and because these residues are found within or near the Lys20/Asp58 interface with FVIIa in the sTF·FVIIa complex structure (11Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In library 1, we used two mutagenic primers simultaneously to randomize codons for residues at position 20 and 21 and at positions 54, 56 and 58, respectively. Position 21 was chosen for randomization because the T21A mutant has a slightly increased affinity for FVIIa (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The affinity of the double mutant sTF D54A,E56A for FVIIa is decreased by 2-fold from wild-type (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and Glu56 interacts with Arg79 from the light chain of FVIIa in the sTF·FVIIa complex (11Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The R79A mutant of FVIIa has a significantly decreased affinity for TF (29Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). After four rounds of sorting this library (∼1010-fold overall binding enrichment), sequencing of DNA from 12 phage revealed a consensus of wild-type residues at all positions tested except for position 54 (TableI), where variations were well tolerated, including some substitutions (Lys, Asn, and Ser) that led to slight improvements in FVIIa affinity. Conservation of Thr21 was surprising given the effect of T21A on FVIIa affinity. Thr21 may be important for proper folding of sTF, since this residue is fully buried in the structure of free sTF (13Muller Y.A. Ultsch M.H. Kelley R.F. deVos A.M.

Open table in a new tab To further probe affinity determinants near position 20, we constructed a second library in which residue 58 was held fixed as the wild-type Asp, while positions 15, 17, 20, 22, and 24 were randomized. Alanine substitutions at sites 15 and 17 result in small changes in FVIIa affinity; I22A and E24A mutants have slightly larger affinity defects of about 3-fold each (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Both Ile22 and Glu24are in contact with Arg79 from FVIIa, while Thr17 interacts with FVIIa residue I69 (11Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). After six rounds of sorting this library (∼1011-fold overall binding enrichment), DNA sequencing of 18 clones revealed a wild-type consensus sequence (Table II). Only one clone, having Lys15 replaced with Arg, had a FVIIa affinity significantly increased relative to the wild-type protein. One clone having a slightly increased FVIIa affinity was found to have the T21A substitution although this site was not randomized in the mutagenic oligonucleotide.Table IIIdentity of TF variants selected on the basis of binding immobilized BEGR-7a: library 2, after six rounds of sortingResidue positionKd (hTFAA)2-aDissociation constants for hTFAA and its variants were determined from kinetic parameters for binding immobilized FVIIa using a BIAcore instrument./Kd (mut)1517202224Wild typeLysThrLysIleGlu1SelectantsLysValLysIleSer (7)2.0LysThrLysIleGlu (2)1.0ArgThrLysIleGlu (5)4.5LysValLysIleGlu1.0ArgSerLysIleThr1.9TrpIleLysValLys1.4LysThrLysIleGlu2-bThis clone contained an adventitious mutation encoding a T21A substitution.2.5ConsensusLysThrLysIleGluND2-cNot determined.ValSer2-a Dissociation constants for hTFAA and its variants were determined from kinetic parameters for binding immobilized FVIIa using a BIAcore instrument.2-b This clone contained an adventitious mutation encoding a T21A substitution.2-c Not determined. Open table in a new tab The results from sorting the first two libraries demonstrated that a cytokine receptor superfamily member can be successfully displayed on bacteriophage and selected for target binding, albeit without producing a novel solution for the interface. The maintenance of wild-type consensus sequences at randomized positions occurred despite starting with templates that had non-wild-type residues at key positions (see “Experimental Procedures”). In addition, we observed diverse codons at randomized positions upon sequencing of the starting libraries as well as silent mutational changes at many positions that coded for the wild-type residue after sorting (data not shown). These results, therefore, strongly reinforced the findings from the scanning mutagenesis studies that Lys20 and Asp58 are very important for TF interactions with FVIIa. Furthermore, the results dictated a change in strategy to circumvent the problem of returning wild-type residues at randomized positions. We theorized that the dominant contribution to binding from Lys20 and Asp58 may have masked more subtle interactions from other sites. Consequently, in a third library, the template K20A substitution was left unperturbed, and a single primer was used to randomize codons for residues at positions 58, 61, 62, 65, and 66. The latter four positions were chosen because double alanine substitutions at positions 61 and 62 and positions 65 and 66, had the effects of modestly decreasing and increasing sTF affinity for FVIIa, respectively (9Kelley R.F. Costas K.E. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although this library did not bear a complete complement of randomized sequences (we estimated that 1 × 106 of the 3.4 × 107 independent transformants necessary for completeness were present in the starting library), six rounds of sorting nevertheless led to selection of phage specifically binding to FVIIa (∼1011-fold overall binding enrichment). Sequences from 12 phage templates (TableIII) indicated a strong consensus developed in which positions 61, 62, 65, and 66 returned as wild type. Interestingly, position 58 returned exclusively as a tryptophan in place of the wild-type Asp or the template Glu. To fully characterize the variant TF containing the K20A and D58W substitutions (A20W58), oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed on phagemid pTF-g3 to encode the substitutions in an otherwise wild-type protein. This tactic allowed us to analyze the effect of the K20A and D58W mutations on cofactor function free from the effects imposed by the hTFAA (K165A,K166A) substitutions. The A20W58 TF protein was expressed in and purified from nonsuppressor E. coli strain 27C7 in soluble form and then tested for FVIIa binding affinity and for its ability to act as a cofactor for FVIIa-dependent proteolytic activity.Table IIIIdentity of TF variants selected on the basis of binding immobilized BEGR-7a: library 3, after six rounds of sortingResidue positionKd (hTFAA)3-aDissociation constants for hTFAA and its variants were determ"
