https://openalex.org/W1974494621,"Preliminary tests have shown that the endosperms of maize seeds homozygous for the opaque-2 mutant gene have a higher lysine content than normal kernels. As a critical test, a backcross progeny was divided into opaque-2 and normal kernels, the endosperms separated, and the amino acids determined. The opaque-2 endosperms had a different amino acid pattern and 69 percent more lysine than the normal seeds. The major reason for these changes is the synthesis of proteins with a greater content of basic amino acids in the acid-soluble fraction of the mutant endosperm. This is accompanied by a reduction in the ratio of zein to glutelin."
https://openalex.org/W2029129765,"Computer-averaged potentials evoked from the cortex were recorded to nonsignal stimuli and to randomly interspersed signal stimuli requiring detection and response during prolonged visual vigilance. As detection efficiency diminished over time, the amplitude of evoked responses to nonsignal stimuli decreased and latency increased. Fluctuations in vigilance (attentiveness) during the course of the task also were accompanied by corresponding changes in evoked-potentials to nonsignal stimuli. More specific lapses of attention, revealed by detection failures, resulted in average evoked-responses of lower amplitude to missed as compared with detected signals."
https://openalex.org/W2021843442,"In femoral radiographs of 2030 aging women, the diameter of the midshaft periosteum increased as cortical thickness declined. Since the cortical area enlarged, periosteal accretion exceeded endosteal resorption. Since the section modulus increased more than did cortical area, the ratio of flexural failure resistance to crush resistance increased, in apparent contrast to the changes observed in the femoral neck."

https://openalex.org/W2028062784,"Multiple samples of serum from a Gm(a-) female mated to a Gm(a+) male were obtained before, during, and after each of four normal uncomplicated pregnancies and tested for antibody to human gamma globulins of differing genetic types. An agglutinator for the Gm(a) factor first appeared in the mother's serum during the third trimester of the fourth pregnancy. The newborn (male) was genotypically Gm(a+), since his serum contained, in addition to maternal Gm(a-) gamma globulin, small amounts of Gm(a+) gamma globulin."
https://openalex.org/W2079597900,"Publisher Summary This chapter deals with the origin and development of immune response. The initial morphological studies of congenital diseases from the files of the Institute of Pathology proved quite rewarding. Infections of the fetus with Treponema pallidum and Toxoplasma gondii were accompanied by an impressive plasmacytosis in the lesions themselves, and plasma cells and premature lymphofollicular maturation were also present in the draining lymph nodes and spleen in many cases. A subsequent study of the histopathology of congenital rubella infection suggested that the maturation of immunological capabilities in the human fetus had other interesting implications. Fetuses infected with rubella virus during the first trimester show multiple disorders of development with no signs of inflammation. The chapter includes with a discussion on the timing of acquisition of immunological competence to different antigens in the fetal lamb."

https://openalex.org/W2060811951,"Two populations of immunologically distinguishable 7S gamma globulins in normal human serum and two corresponding antigenic types of myeloma 7S gamma globulins have been detected with rabbit antiserums to proteins associated with pathological conditions, the differences being related to the H-chains of 7S gamma globulin. No relationship exists with type I and type II antigenic classification, determined by L-chains. Human serums with various hereditary gamma globulin (Gm) specificities contain both types of 7S gamma globulin."
https://openalex.org/W2032416210,"Autotrophic Euglena gracilis Klebs (strain Z) that are grown axenically on defined, inorganic medium on a regime of 14 hours of light and 10 hours of darkness double their cell number every 24 hours by dividing synchronously during the dark period. The DNA content doubles in a stepwise manner during the last 6 hours of the light period just prior to cell division. This result agrees with those for most higher cells. Although DNA replication is a necessary condition for cell division it is not a sufficient one."
https://openalex.org/W2062551112,"In the vicinity of Calgary, Alberta, 20.5 percent of wild house mice tested were found to be heterozygous for the lethal allele designated t(w5), and an additional 3.4 percent were heterozygous for one or more alleles not belonging to the t(w5) group. The distribution patterns of wild-type and lethal alleles within and between clusters of small demes supports the postulate that random drift plays a significant role in the evolution of these populations. Distribution patterns also suggest that the demes are reproductively isolated to a greater degree than has been generally assumed."

https://openalex.org/W2008458462,The c1-t mutants of bacteriophage lambda can form prophage at 36 degrees C but cause lysis of sensitive bacteria at temperatures above 42 degrees C. Growth of cultures at 42 degrees to 46 degrees C induces prophage replication and lysis in Escherichia coli K12 (lambda c1-t); lysogenic strains containing wild-type prophage are not induced to lyse at these temperatures. Heat induction is prevented by chloramphenicol. Strains containing heatinducible prophage are much more sensitive to killing by ultraviolet light than is K12 (lambda+).
https://openalex.org/W2014467511,In cultures of rat marrow cells essentially all of the labeled iron which was incorporated into heme was shown to be in hemoglobin. Iron bound to rat plasma was incorporated into hemoglobin to a greater extent than was iron bound to fetal calf serum. Incorporation of iron bound to rat plasma was greater when some fetal calf serum was present than when rat plasma provided the total protein. These data suggest preferential use of homologous iron-binding proteins of the plasma.

https://openalex.org/W1971568869,"Antiserums from rabbits immunized with several purine- and pyrimidine-containing albumin conjugates can penetrate and become fixed within cells of Arbacia punctulata. All of these specific antiserums were found to inhibit embryonic development of the fertilized sea urchin egg. The stage of arrestment of development was dependent in part upon the dilution of antiserum, and also upon the nature of its specificity. It is suggested that the observed results reflect the interaction of these antiserums with singlestranded DNA within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1979336476,"Small amounts of beta-carotene and lutein were found in Orconectes pellucidus pellucidus. Cambarus bartonii tenebrosus from the same cave contained much less carotenoid than surface crayfish. Astaxanthin, the principal carotenoid of most Crustacea, was absent from O. p. pellucidus, but accounted for 83 percent of the carotenoid of C. b. tenebrosus. These findings support other observations that pigmentation is dependent on the amount of carotenoid in the diet rather than on the presence of light. Furthermore, they suggest that O. p. pellucidus has lost or has never developed the ability to oxidize dietary carotenoids."

https://openalex.org/W2022329098,"Treatment of intact tobacco leaves with toxin-containing culture filtrates of Pseudomonas tabaci markedly reduced the ribonucleic acid content of the leaves. The decrease was counteracted by spraying the leaves with 10-4Mkinetin. Simultaneously with the decrease in RNA, the ribonuclease activity of extracts from tissues treated with toxin increased. Experiments on the effect of kinetin on the ribonuclease activity of toxin-treated tissues gave no consistent results."

Degenerated fibers could be seen in the corpus callosum and in the lateral and suprasylvian gyri of the opposite hemisphere. Results suggest the presence of a crossed geniculocortical pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2057085798,"Certain protozoa, bacteria, and viruses when phagocytosed by host cells become surrounded by an intracytoplasmic boundary. This membrane prevents the fluorescent antibiotic tetracycline from entering the parasites when it is added to the medium, since they show no fluorescence, whereas extracellular parasites are immediately visible. As soon as the host cell dies, the intracellular parasites also become visible. This indicates that the boundary probably is of host origin. This phenomenon provides a means for selective permeability studies of such boundaries. A similar exclusion of tetracycline from certain extracellular parasites is seen in the presence of whole serum."

https://openalex.org/W1972048020,"Visual exploration was studied in maternally reared and maternally deprived monkeys. When an animal pressed a bar an opaque screen was raised providing a brief view of either of a pair of stimuli. Subjects reared by their mothers pressed more to see animate than inanimate objects. With increasing age, the number of bar-pressing responses decreased for an adult female stimulus, increased for an age peer and for food, and remained low for geometric forms and an empty chamber. Maternally deprived subjects established uniformly low response levels to all stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2002682135,"The microsomal fraction from the electric organ of the eel Electrophorus electricus catalyzes the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate in the presence of Mg(++), Na(+), and K(+). The same preparation catalyzes a Mg(++)-dependent transphosphorylation between adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate. Both of these reactions are inhibited after treatment of the microsomes with N-ethyl maleimide. However, the addition of Na(+) reactivates the transphosphorylation, and the rate becomes more rapid than that of the original. This new Na(+)-sensitive exchange reaction is believed to be a component of the hydrolytic reaction."
