https://openalex.org/W2040179925,"Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) are known to induce production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have been suggested to act as second messengers. Here we demonstrate that ROS production by bovine chondrocytes upon cytokine stimulation induces c-jun expression. Since c-jun expression is regulated by its own gene product via phosphorylation by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), we investigated if cytokines and ROS could modulate JNK activity in chondrocyte monolayer cultures. Treatment of bovine chondrocytes with both IL-1 and TNFα leads to rapid induction of JNK activity, stimulating JNK activity 7- and 20-fold, respectively. Importantly, the observation that antioxidant treatment antagonizes IL-1 and TNFα activation of JNK provides strong evidence that ROS can act as mediators of JNK activity. Moreover, potent activation of JNK is also observed by direct addition of the ROS hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to the chondrocyte cultures. Nitric oxide (NO), a multifunctional ROS, also appears to simulate JNK, albeit to a lesser extent. These findings identify JNK as another molecular target for the actions of NO and H2O2. In addition, the inhibitory effect of diphenyleneiodonium on JNK activation implicates the involvement of flavonoid-containing enzymes in the ROS-mediated signaling process. Overstimulation of JNK activity by excessive production of ROS may, therefore, underlie pathological conditions such as arthritis and cancer.

The pleiotropic effects of these two cytokines are mediated through distinct cell surface receptors (2Camussi G. Albano E. Tetta C. Bussolino F. Eur. J.

Despite the incomplete understanding of the membrane signaling events following the occupancy of the cytokine receptors, ligand interaction is known to stimulate the release of a wide variety of putative second messengers. Some of the known signal transduction pathways common to both IL-1 and TNFα include coupling to G-proteins (6O'Neill L.A.J. Ikebe T. Sarsfield S.J. Saklatvala J. J.

In addition to the above messengers, a class of highly diffusible and ubiquitous molecules termed reactive oxygen species (ROS) has recently been recognized to act as signaling intermediates for cytokines, including IL-1 and TNFα (14Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S. Younes M. Sies H. Resch K. Habermehl G.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 539-545Google Scholar, 15Tiku M.L. Liesch J.B. Robertson F.M. J.

ROS encompass species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide (NO), and hydroxyl radicals (17Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Google Scholar). These highly reactive molecules are known to regulate many important cellular events, including gene expression (16Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Google Scholar, 18Devary Y.

The signal transduction cascades elicited after exposure to IL-1 and TNFα culminate in a nuclear response characterized by the activation of several key transcriptional regulators, including nuclear factor κB (20Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Google Scholar, 23Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Google Scholar) and AP-1 (16Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Google Scholar, 24Agnel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Google Scholar). Hence, genes with an AP-1 binding site, such as those encoding the metalloproteinases collagenase and stromelysin, are potential targets for the two cytokines (25Zafarullah M. Martel-Pelletier J. Cloutier J.-M. Gedamu L. Pelletier J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 169-172Google Scholar, 26Lafyatis R. Kim S.-J. Angel P. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Wilder R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 973-980Google Scholar). AP-1 is composed of the protein products of c-fos and c-jun; their levels of gene expression are also stimulated by cytokines (24Agnel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Google Scholar). Posttranslational modification of AP-1 transcriptional activity also plays an important role in the control of AP-1-regulated gene expression. Such control is executed in the form of phosphorylation of Fos and Jun proteins by members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (27Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Google Scholar, 28Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1-20Google Scholar, 29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

The transcriptional activity of the c-Jun protein is greatly enhanced by phosphorylation of two serine residues at positions 63 and 73 in its activation domain (31Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Google Scholar, 32Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the NH2 terminus of c-Jun is catalyzed by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), a subgroup of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (28Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1-20Google Scholar, 29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar, 30Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar). The properties of JNKs that distinguish them from other mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as extracellular signal-related kinases, include their activation by agents such as ultraviolet irradiation, heat shock, protein synthesis inhibitors, and inflammatory cytokines (33Cobb M. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar, 34Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Google Scholar). Since many of the JNK activators can be regarded as cellular stress, JNKs have also been termed stress-activated protein kinases (30Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar). Inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and IL-1, have been shown to induce JNKs (35Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Google Scholar) and c-jun expression (2Camussi G. Albano E. Tetta C. Bussolino F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 3-14Google Scholar, 24Agnel P. Karin M.

A. 1993; 90: 7054-7058Google Scholar); however, the second messengers responsible for their activation remain unidentified. Our earlier study demonstrated ROS production upon cytokine stimulation in bovine chondrocytes (16Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Google Scholar); 2Y. Y. C. Lo, unpublished observations. thus, we examined the molecular links between cytokine-induced ROS generation and its downstream signaling events. Human recombinant IL-1β was generously supplied by Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland. Human recombinant TNFα was from Genzyme Corp. H2O2 was from Fisher Scientific. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and ascorbic acid (Asc) were from Sigma. S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories. Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) was from Toronto Research Chemicals. Radioactive isotopes and x-ray films were from DuPont NEN. Glutathione-Sepharose was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech. Purified anti-human p46JNK1 monoclonal antibody was purchased from PharMingen. This antibody recognizes both the Mr 46,000 JNK1 and the related Mr 55,000 JNK2 proteins. Primary cultures of bovine articular chondrocytes were isolated from bovine articular cartilage as described by Cruz et al. (37Cruz T.F. Mills G. Pritzker K.P.H. Kandel R.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 717-721Google Scholar). Bovine chondrocytes were plated at 2 × 106 cells/ml in 12 ml of Ham's F-12 media containing 3% antibiotics and 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO2. Prior to any treatments, chondrocytes were serum-starved overnight. Total RNA was isolated by the acidified guanidine isothiocyanate method (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) and quantitated by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. Denatured RNA samples (10–15 µg) were analyzed by gel electrophoresis in a 1% denaturing agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad), and cross-linked with an ultraviolet cross-linker (Stratagene UV Stratalinker 1800). The blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled human c-jun cDNA, subsequently stripped, and re-probed with 32P-labeled rat glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA as internal control. Following treatment of chondrocytes with various agents, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested according to published procedures by Hibi et al. (29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were suspended in WCE buffer and rotated at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected as WCE after being centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration in the cell lysate was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Ten µg of WCE were incubated at 30°C for 20 min in the presence of 40 µM ATP, 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 µg of glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST-c-Jun (5–89) as substrate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer and then boiled for 5 min. The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by drying and autoradiography. Phosphorylation signals were quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). WCE was diluted according to the procedures described by Hibi et al. (29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar). Extract containing 100–300 µg of protein was added to 10 µl of glutathione-Sepharose suspension prebound with 20 µg of GST-c-Jun or GST. The mixture was rotated at 4°C for 3 h and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 s. The pelleted glutathione beads were washed with buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, and 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then resuspended in 30 µl of kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 25 mMβ-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mM Na3VO4) containing 20 µM ATP and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After being incubated at 30°C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling in Laemmli buffer. Samples containing phosphorylated proteins were first resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by drying, autoradiography, and quantitation by phosphorimaging analysis. After c-Jun-binding proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose beads prebound with GST-c-Jun as described above, proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer. The eluted proteins were then resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was polymerized in the presence of 40 µg/ml GST-c-Jun or GST. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice with 20% isopropanol and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) for 30 min. The gel was subsequently washed twice for 30 min with 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. The gel was then incubated in 6 M guanidine HCl, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, for 1 h, followed by incubation at 4°C overnight with a few changes of 0.04% Tween 20, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. For kinase reaction, the gel was incubated in kinase buffer containing 40 µM ATP and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30°C for 1 h. Then the gel was washed extensively with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate. Finally, the gel was vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography. Proteins specifically associated with c-Jun were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose beads prebounded with GST-c-Jun as described under “Solid-phase (S-P) Kinase Assay.” Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.), which was then probed with monoclonal antibodies against p46JNK1. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp.). In our previous studies, we have implicated the involvement of ROS in TNFα- and IL-1-mediated nuclear response, such as the induction of c-fos gene expression (16Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Google Scholar).2 Not only were antioxidants shown to inhibit cytokine induction of c-fos, we and others have also demonstrated enhancement of c-fos expression by exogenous addition of H2O2 in bovine chondrocytes, HeLa cells, and osteoblasts (16Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Google Scholar, 18Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Lau L.F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2804-2811Google Scholar, 19Nose K. Shibanuma M. Kikuchi K. Kageyama H. Sakiyama S. Kuroki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 99-106Google Scholar). In view of this, we decided to examine the effects of IL-1, TNFα, and ROS on another early response gene c-jun, of which the protein product heterodimerizes with Fos to form the AP-1 transcription factor (24Agnel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Google Scholar). Time course analyses showed that IL-1 and TNFα caused a transient increase in the steady-state c-jun mRNA levels with optimal expression at around 30 min (Fig. 1A). To assess the relevance of ROS as putative second messengers in the induction of c-jun by IL-1 and TNFα, we tested if endogenous ROS were required in cytokine-mediated c-jun regulation. To do this, chondrocytes were first treated with the antioxidants, NAC and Asc, before the addition of cytokines. Both NAC and Asc are effective free radical scavengers; the former is known to increase intracellular glutathione levels, which in turn modulate the concentration of ROS via glutathione peroxidase (17Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Google Scholar). On the other hand, Asc itself is highly reactive toward radicals and has proven to be a versatile scavenger (39Rose R.C. Bode A.M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1135-1142Google Scholar). NAC and Asc, which neutralize the activities of ROS, reduced both IL-1- and TNFα-induced c-jun mRNA levels (Fig. 1B), implicating ROS in the signaling cascade leading to c-jun induction. Next we asked whether exogenous addition of ROS could mimic the effects of IL-1 and TNFα with respect to induction of c-jun. Hydrogen peroxide, a membrane-permeable reagent physiologically produced in large amounts by cells such as granulocytes (17Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Google Scholar), has been widely used to assess the effects of ROS. Hydrogen peroxide was found to activate c-jun gene expression with induction first apparent at 30 min (Fig. 1C), whereas the expression of the housekeeping gene GAPDH was not affected. The induction of c-jun mRNA expression by H2O2 was transient and is similar to the c-jun induction profiles obtained with TNFα and IL-1. These data provide further evidence that ROS can indeed act as second messengers in signaling c-jun expression in chondrocyte cultures. The findings that ROS are involved in inducing expression of c-jun prompted us to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Interestingly, the c-jun promoter contains two AP-1-like sequences termed JUN1 and JUN2 (18Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Lau L.F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2804-2811Google Scholar, 40Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Google Scholar, 41van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R. Bosch A. de Vries-Smits L. Herrlich P. Zantema A. Angel P. van der Eb A.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-487Google Scholar). Each of these sites is bound by a heterodimer of c-Jun in association with another transcription factor, ATF2. Hence, the c-jun promoter is autoregulated by its own gene product (40Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Google Scholar, 41van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R. Bosch A. de Vries-Smits L. Herrlich P. Zantema A. Angel P. van der Eb A.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-487Google Scholar). Activation of the c-jun promoter involves phosphorylation of the prebound c-Jun-ATF2 heterodimers by JNKs/stress-activated protein kinases, which are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (28Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1-20Google Scholar, 29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar, 30Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine-63 and serine-73 in the activation domain of c-Jun increases its activation potential (31Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Google Scholar, 32Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Google Scholar). These findings, coupled with our analyses of c-jun induction described above, led us to hypothesize that JNKs in chondrocytes might also be regulated by cytokines with ROS as activating intermediates. WCE and S-P assays were used to examine JNK activity. Following the treatment of chondrocytes with various agents, a whole cell lysate was prepared by lysis with detergent. This extract could be assayed directly with a GST-c-Jun fusion protein as substrate in the WCE assay. Alternatively, in the S-P assay, the extract was first incubated with the GST-c-Jun fusion protein to allow binding of endogenous JNKs. Then, unbound proteins were washed off, and kinase activity was analyzed in the presence of radioisotopes. The GST-c-Jun fusion protein used to bind the c-Jun-specific kinases now acted as a substrate in the kinase reaction. We first looked at the effects of cytokines on JNK activity. Treatment with IL-1 and TNFα potently activated JNK activity, as measured by phosphorylation of the substrate GST-c-Jun in the WCE assay (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation was observed as early as 15 min and gradually decreased over the course of 2 h. Phosphorimaging analysis showed that maximum fold-induction of JNK activities by IL-1 and TNFα were 7- and 20-fold, respectively. The S-P assay in which c-Jun-specific kinases were first bound to the substrate gave essentially the same results. This indicated that the phosphorylation signals seen in the “whole cell extract” assay were indeed from c-Jun-specific kinases. As a control, phosphorylation was not observed with the GST moiety alone as substrate (data not shown). We again exploited the abilities of antioxidants to perturb intracellular ROS levels, to assess the role of endogenous ROS in regulating the c-Jun kinases. Antioxidant treatment antagonized the stimulating effects of IL-1 and TNFα on c-Jun kinase activity (Fig. 2B), indicating that in vivo ROS production does play a role in modulating JNK activity. Next we tested the effects of two ROS, H2O2 and NO generated by SNAP, on the activity of JNK. The ROS NO has recently gained substantial recognition as a signaling molecule with the property of both neurotransmitter and hormone (42Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Google Scholar). NO production by many cell types, including chondrocytes, is also significantly enhanced in the presence of cytokines (16Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Google Scholar, 43Damoulis P.D. Hauschka P.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 924-931Google Scholar).2Fig. 2C clearly shows that the direct addition of H2O2 dramatically activated JNK. Interestingly, NO also stimulated the kinase activity, albeit to a much lesser extent. Both NO and H2O2 stimulated JNK after 15 min treatment (Fig. 2C). Signal quantitation indicated that the maximum fold-activation of JNK activity by H2O2 was around 8-fold. These data provided the first direct evidence that ROS can modulate the activity of JNK. One class of enzymes that are known to give rise to various types of ROS is the flavonoid-containing enzymes. Therefore, we examined the effect of DPI, a potent inhibitor of flavonoid-containing enzymes, such as NADPH oxidase and nitric oxide synthase (44Stuehr D.J. Fasehun O.A. Kwon N.S. Gross S.S.

As with antioxidants, the addition of DPI also attenuated cytokine stimulation of Jun kinase activity (Fig. 3). In bovine chondrocytes, DPI has previously been shown to inhibit IL-1 and TNFα stimulation of intracellular ROS production (16Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Google Scholar).2 Hence, the above findings are in keeping with a role for ROS production by flavonoid-containing enzymes in the cytokine stimulation of JNK activity. Since JNK phosphorylation of c-Jun is critical for its transcriptional activity (28Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Google Scholar, 41van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R. Bosch A. de Vries-Smits L. Herrlich P. Zantema A. Angel P. van der Eb A.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-487Google Scholar), our observation of enhanced JNK activity upon exposure to cytokines is consistent with the cytokine induction of c-jun mRNA levels in chondrocytes. The exact pathway from ROS release to JNK activation has yet to be identified. Our finding that DPI inhibits cytokine stimulation of JNK implicates the involvement of flavonoid-containing enzymes such as NADPH oxidase. This is particularly noteworthy considering that one of the critical components of NADPH oxidase, Rac1, has been shown recently to be an upstream regulator of JNK (45Quinn M. Evans T. Priscu L. Jesaitis A. Bokoch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Google Scholar, 46Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar, 47Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Google Scholar). Perhaps the enhanced activity of the enzyme NADPH oxidase in the presence of Rac1 gives rise to increased ROS levels, which then initiates a kinase cascade culminating in the activation of JNK. The cellular mechanism of ROS sensing and the identity of the direct sensor molecules await further characterization. JNKs themselves do not appear to be the direct targets of ROS because both H2O2 and SNAP could not activate JNKs immobilized onto GST-c-Jun-glutathione beads (data not shown). Nonetheless, intracellular ROS sensing may occur through the redox regulation of sensor molecules. Such form of regulation has been demonstrated for the transcription factors Fos and Jun in which oxidation-reduction of a key cysteine residue modulates DNA binding activity (48Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Google Scholar). Furthermore, similar redox modification may also underlie direct modulation of p21ras activity by ROS such as H2O2 and NO (49Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Google Scholar, 50Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Google Scholar). Two JNK isoforms (Mr 46,000 JNK1 and Mr 55,000 JNK2) have been identified in HeLa cells (29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar); both of them are capable of phosphorylating the Jun activation domain. To distinguish the different isoforms in bovine chondrocytes, we used a S-P in-gel kinase assay to determine the sizes of JNKs being activated upon cytokine stimulation. After the chondrocytes were treated with IL-1 or TNFα in the presence or absence of the antioxidant NAC, whole cell extracts were isolated and first incubated with GST-c-Jun-glutathione beads to selectively bind Jun-specific kinases. Then protein kinase activities were examined following SDS-PAGE on gels that were polymerized with GST or GST-c-Jun. Extracts of cells treated with either IL-1 or TNFα displayed very efficient stimulation of two kinases, migrating at positions of Mr 46,000 and Mr 55,000, that phosphorylated GST-c-Jun but not GST in the gel (Fig. 4). The phosphorylation signal observed at position Mr 46,000 was much stronger than that at Mr 55,000. The apparent molecular weights of the Mr 46,000 and the Mr 55,000 c-Jun kinases match well with that of JNK1 and JNK2, respectively. Since this S-P in-gel kinase experiment was designed to assay only for kinases that specifically bind GST-c-Jun, a property unique to JNK, we therefore conclude that the two kinases correspond to JNK1 and JNK2. In addition, Fig. 4 also shows that activation of the two c-Jun kinases were markedly inhibited by the antioxidant NAC. This indicates that both JNK isoforms contribute to the ROS-mediated cytokine stimulation of c-Jun kinase activity. Nevertheless, the higher activity associated with the Mr 46,000 JNK1 upon cytokine stimulation might imply a larger contribution of this isoform to the total c-Jun kinase activity. Western blot analysis was also used to definitively identify the c-Jun-associated kinases in primary chondrocytes. We used a purified anti-human JNK1 monoclonal antibody that also cross-reacts with human JNK2, as seen in Fig. 5, lane 1, with HeLa whole cell extract. The anti-human JNK1 antibody reacted with two proteins having identical sizes as human JNK1 and JNK2 in chondrocyte extract (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). Although the JNK2 band was less prominent than the JNK1 band in the chondrocyte extract, lane 2 indicates only that both JNK1 and JNK2 are present in chondrocytes and does not necessarily reflect the relative amounts of each c-Jun kinase. Interestingly, the JNK1 protein band appears as a doublet in extracts stimulated with either IL-1 or TNFα (Fig. 5, lanes 3–5). The upper band of the doublet probably corresponds to phosphorylated, and thus activated, form of JNK1 (51Dai T. Rubie E. Franklin C.C. Kraft A. Gillespie D.A.F. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 849-855Google Scholar). It is known that unactivated JNKs can associate with c-Jun; however, activation leads to enhanced binding (51Dai T. Rubie E. Franklin C.C. Kraft A. Gillespie D.A.F. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 849-855Google Scholar). In this experiment, JNK2 was barely detectable by this antibody, probably due to poor cross-reactivity of the antibody toward the bovine counterpart of human JNK2 or lower amount of bound JNK2, as suggested by the S-P in-gel kinase experiment, or both (Fig. 4). The relatively weak interaction of JNK2 with c-Jun seen in our chondrocyte system is also consistent with similar findings in human cells (29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar). Taken together, this study demonstrates that ROS is a link between cytokine-receptor interaction and stimulation of JNK activity and c-jun expression. ROS have been implicated as second messengers in modulating diverse cellular functions in various cell types including chondrocytes, neutrophils, and vascular smooth muscle cells (16Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Google Scholar, 20Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Google Scholar, 52Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Rotin D. Grinstein S. Downey G.P.

Here we provide strong evidence that JNK activation may mediate some of the signaling effects of ROS. Significantly, this report also identifies JNK as another molecular target for the versatile molecule, nitric oxide. This may become more important in pathological conditions in which an abnormally high concentration of cytokines leads to increased NO production (42Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Google Scholar, 54Stefanovic-Racic M. Stadler J. Evans C.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1036-1044Google Scholar). Overstimulation of JNK activity by cytokine-stimulated ROS production (e.g. NO and H2O2) may cause deregulated c-jun expression. The c-jun protein product, as a key component of AP-1, may then induce inappropriate transcriptional responses, leading to overexpression of metalloproteinases and uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Thus, abnormal activation of the JNK cascade may underlie disease conditions such as arthritis and cancer, which often are characterized by overproduction of ROS and metalloproteinases (54Stefanovic-Racic M. Stadler J. Evans C.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1036-1044Google Scholar, 55Santos L. Tipping P.G. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 406-414Google Scholar, 56Frenkel K.

https://openalex.org/W2083626146,"The efflux of cholesterol from cells in culture to cyclodextrin acceptors has been reported to be substantially more rapid than efflux induced by other known acceptors of cholesterol (Kilsdonk, E. P. C., Yancey, P., Stoudt, G., Bangerter, F. W., Johnson, W. J., Phillips, M. C., and Rothblat, G. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 17250-17256). In this study, we compared the kinetics of cholesterol efflux from cells with 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrins and with discoidal high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles to probe the mechanisms governing the remarkably rapid rates of cyclodextrin-mediated efflux. The rate of cholesterol efflux was enhanced by shaking cells growing in a monolayer and further enhanced by placing cells in suspension to achieve maximal efflux rates. The extent of efflux was dependent on cyclodextrin concentration, and maximal efflux was observed at concentrations >50 mM. For several cell types, biexponential kinetics of cellular cholesterol efflux were observed, indicating the existence of two kinetic pools of cholesterol: a fast pool (half-time (t1/2) approximately 19-23 s) and a slow pool with t1/2 of 15-30 min. Two distinct kinetic pools of cholesterol were also observed with model membranes (large unilamellar cholesterol-containing vesicles), implying that the cellular pools are in the plasma membrane. Cellular cholesterol content was altered by incubating cells with solutions of cyclodextrins complexed with increasing levels of cholesterol. The number of kinetic pools was unaffected by raising the cellular cholesterol content, but the size of the fast pool increased. After depleting cells of the fast pool of cholesterol, this pool was completely restored after a 40-min recovery period. The temperature dependence of cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol efflux from cells and model membranes was compared; the activation energies were 7 kcal/mol and 2 kcal/mol, respectively. The equivalent activation energy observed with apo-HDL-phospholipid acceptor particles was 20 kcal/mol. It seems that cyclodextrin molecules are substantially more efficient than phospholipid acceptors, because cholesterol molecules desorbing from a membrane surface can diffuse directly into the hydrophobic core of a cyclodextrin molecule without having to desorb completely into the aqueous phase before being sequestered by the acceptor."

MAP kinases are activated by phosphorylation on T and Y residues within a TXY phosphorylation motif, where X can be Glu (E), Pro (P), or Gly (G). Three classes of dual specificity MAP kinases may be defined based on their motifs (TEY, TPY, and TGY), which we will term ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK, and p38, respectively. mitogen-activated protein kinase angiotensin II big mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 extracellular signal-regulated kinase c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase MAP kinase/ERK kinase MAP kinase kinase myelin basic protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis platelet-derived growth factor phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stress-activated protein kinase tumor necrosis factor-α vascular smooth muscle cell human umbilical vein endothelial cells human arterial smooth muscle cells human skin fibroblasts 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester. Relative activation of the three classes of MAP kinases is characteristic for particular stimuli. For example, growth factors such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and epidermal growth factor activate ERK1/2 strongly but JNK/SAPK and p38 weakly (10Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7352-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Hyperosmolar stress is a strong stimulus for p38 (8Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar), and this stimulus also activates ERK1/2 and JNK in rat ventricular myocytes (11Bogoyevitch M. Ketterman A. Sugden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29710-29717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In VSMC we have shown that growth factors and angiotensin II (AngII) are powerful activators of ERK1/2 (12Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recently we found that oxidative stress activated ERK1/2 when the oxidative stress was superoxide but not H2O2 (13Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In other systems, oxidative stress has been demonstrated to activate JNK strongly (14Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The specificity for MAP kinase activation is determined, in part, by members of the MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) family, which exhibit unique pairing with downstream MAP kinases. For example, MEK1 and MEK2 activate ERK1/2, MKK3 activates p38, and MKK4 (i.e. SEK1 the murine homolog of MKK4) activates JNK/SAPK. These data suggest that cell-specific and stimulus-specific events regulate the activities of the three classes of MAP kinases. The specificity of activation of MAP kinases by individual stimuli is reiterated by specific substrates for each class. Common substrates for the MAP kinases are transcription factors that upon phosphorylation may be activated and induce changes in gene expression.

(21Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and Zhou et al. (22Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12664-12669Google Scholar). Because the primary structure of this MAP kinase is quite unique from ERK1/2 (21Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), the name BMK1 will be used in this paper. BMK1 has a TEY sequence in its dual phosphorylation site like ERK1/2 but has unique C-terminal and loop-12 domains compared with ERK1/2, suggesting that its regulation and function may be different from those of ERK1/2. To define the regulation of BMK1, we have characterized its activation in cultured rat VSMC, which we have previously shown to have robust ERK activity in response to several stimuli. We show here that activation of BMK1 by hormonal and chemical stimuli is clearly distinct from activation of ERK1/2. In particular, BMK1 appears to participate in a redox-sensitive pathway activated by H2O2 but not by agonists such as PMA, AngII, PDGF, and TNF-α. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) were isolated from 200-250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats and maintained in 10% calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (23Duff J.L.

Passage 5-15 VSMC at 70-80% confluence in 100-mm dishes were growth arrested by incubation in 0.4% calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h to use.

Cells at passage 3 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and were deprived of growth factors by incubation in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin for 24 h. Human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASM) and human skin fibroblasts (HSF) were a kind gift from Dr. R. Ross and Dr. J. F. Oram, respectively, and were maintained in subconfluent state as described (25Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Potts B.C. Macdonald S.G. Ross R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Normal human skin fibroblasts were grown from explants of punch biopsies of skin from the inner thighs of normal volunteers in plastic tissue flasks containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Both HASM and HSF were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/0.4% calf serum for 2 days before experiments. The peptide sequence used to generate rabbit anti-human BMK1 antibody was keyhole limpet hemocyanin-EGHGMNPADIESLQREIQMDSPML. The keyhole limpet hemocyanin-peptide immunogen was emulsified by mixing with an equal volume of Freund's adjuvant and injected into three to four subcutaneous dorsal sites, for a total volume of 1 ml (0.1 mg of peptide) per immunization. Two weeks after the third boost, blood was allowed to clot, and serum was collected by centrifugation. The anti-peptide antibody titer was determined with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay with free peptide on the solid phase (1 µg/well). The results are expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that resulted in an absorbance at 492 nm of 0.2 (detection with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and peroxidase). The titer for the anti-serum was 1:29,900, and preimmune serum was less than 1:50. After treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 100 µM Na3VO4, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 µM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml leupeptin) and flash-frozen on a dry ice/ethanol bath. After allowing the cells to thaw, cells were scraped off the dish and centrifuged at 14,000 × g (4°C for 30 min), and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-BMK1 antibody (3 µl) or preimmune serum for 3 h at 4°C and then incubated with 20 µl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h on a roller system at 4°C. The beads were washed two times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, 2 times with 1 ml of LiCl wash buffer (500 mM LiCl, 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM dithiothreitol), and two times in 1 ml of washing buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). For Western blot analysis, 15 µg of protein or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™-ECL, Amersham Corp.) as described previously (27Duff J.D. Monia B.P. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7161-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with a commercial blocking buffer from Life Technologies, Inc. The blots were incubated for 4 h at room temperature with the BMK1 antibody, followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). An in gel kinase assay to measure ERK1/2 phosphotransferase activity was performed on cell lysates as described previously (27Duff J.D. Monia B.P. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7161-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were harvested as described above. Equal amounts of protein (5-10 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE through a gel containing 0.4 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP). The gel was then incubated twice in buffer A (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol) containing 20% isopropyl alcohol for 30 min, once in buffer A for 1 h, twice in buffer A containing 0.04% Tween 20 at 4°C for 16 h and for 2 h, and once in buffer A containing 100 µM Na3VO4, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 µM ATP, and 50 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by washing the gel five to eight times in fixative solution containing 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 5% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography, and ERK1/2 kinase activity was measured by densitometry of autoradiogram (in the linear range of film exposure) using NIH Image 1.49. We have previously shown that results for in gel kinase assay and immune complex kinase assay for ERK1/2 are highly correlated (R2 = 0.92) (28Tseng H. Peterson T. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The in gel kinase assay is more reproducible and less expensive, so it was used for ERK1/2 kinase assay. BMK1 kinase activity was assayed by MBP phosphorylation as the substrate for BMK1 as described previously (29Abe J. Zhou W. Takuwa N. Taguchi J. Kurokawa K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3407-3412PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed as described above and centrifuged at 14,000 × g (4°C for 30 min), and protein concentration was determined. BMK1 was immunoprecipitated, and BMK1 kinase activity was measured at 30°C for 20 min in the reaction mixture (40 µl) containing 0.1 mg/ml of MBP, 15 µM of ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MnCl2, and 3 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by adding 8 µl of 6 × electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The radioactivity in the band corresponding to BMK1 was determined by densitometry of autoradiogram (in the linear range of film exposure) using NIH Image 1.49. All materials were from Sigma except where indicated. Recombinant PDGF-BB was from Boehringer Mannheim, H2O2 was from Fisher, and BAPTA-AM was from Molecular Probes. An antibody was prepared against the recently cloned MAP kinase, BMK1, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (21Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with BMK1 antibody revealed a prominent 110-kDa protein band in cultured rat VSMC. Preimmune serum showed no band except IgG. To determine which known VSMC agonists activated BMK1, we stimulated growth arrested VSMC with AngII, PDGF-BB, PMA, and TNF-α. We have previously shown that these agonists are potent stimuli for activation of ERK1/2 (12Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), which contain a TEY dual phosphorylation site identical to that present in BMK1. The results presented below indicate that activation of BMK1 by these agonists is very different from activation of ERK1/2. As shown in Fig. 2A, AngII (100 nM) caused only a small activation of BMK1, approximately 2-fold greater than control at 5 min. In contrast, AngII caused a potent activation of ERK1/2 with a 10-fold increase in activity at 5 min. PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) caused only a small increase in BMK1 (Fig. 2B), approximately 1.7-fold at 20 min. In contrast, PDGF-BB was a potent activator of ERK1/2, stimulating an 9-fold increase in activity at 20 min. PMA (200 nM) failed to stimulate BMK1 (Fig. 3A) but caused a 4.5-fold increase in ERK1/2 at 5 min. Finally, TNF-α failed to stimulate BMK1 (Fig. 3B) but caused an 11-fold increase in ERK1/2 activity at 20 min. Thus, these four hormonal agonists, which are potent stimuli for ERK1/2 in VSMC, caused minimal or no activation of BMK1.Fig. 3Phorbol ester and TNF-α weakly stimulate BMK1 activity. Growth arrested VSMC were stimulated with 200 nM PMA (A) and 10 ng/ml TNF-α (B) for the indicated times, cells were harvested, and ERK1/2 and BMK1 activities were determined as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because agonists known to activate ERK1/2 strongly were weak agonists for BMK1, we determined whether agonists known to activate JNK and p38 kinase could activate BMK1. Oxidative stress has previously been shown to activate JNK (14Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), and hyperosmolar stress (e.g. 0.4 M sorbitol) has been shown to activate p38 (8Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). Using the same experimental protocol described for Fig. 2, Fig. 3, we assayed BMK1 activity in response to 200 µM H2O2 and 0.4 M sorbitol. As shown in Fig. 4A, H2O2 was a potent stimulus for BMK1, causing a 3.8-fold increase in activity at 5 min that was sustained for 60 min. In contrast, ERK1/2 was not significantly activated by H2O2. Of interest, sorbitol was a potent stimulus for both BMK1 and ERK1/2 stimulating 10- and 5.7-fold increases in activity at peak time, respectively (Fig. 4B) These data suggest that the regulation of BMK1 may be more similar to JNK and p38 than ERK1/2. We determined the concentration dependence for BMK1 activation by H2O2 and sorbitol. As shown in Fig. 5A, H2O2 stimulation of BMK1 was maximum at 200 µM with half-maximal effect at 50-100 µM. These concentrations are similar to those previously reported for H2O2-mediated stimulation of c-fos mRNA and DNA synthesis in VSMC (30Rao G.N. Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. Berk B.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 31Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 17-21Google Scholar). Sorbitol also stimulated a concentration-dependent increase in BMK1 activity, which was maximal at 0.8 M (Fig. 5B). We previously found that H2O2-mediated c-fos expression was dependent on both calcium and protein kinase C (30Rao G.N. Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. Berk B.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because BMK1 appeared not to be activated by protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms (Fig. 3A), we determined whether BMK1 activation by H2O2 was calcium-dependent. To deplete intracellular calcium, we used thapsigargin (10 µM for 10 min). Following thapsigargin treatment, H2O2 was no longer able to stimulate BMK1 (Fig. 6). We also used BAPTA-AM to chelate intracellular calcium as previously reported (28Tseng H. Peterson T. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, BAPTA-AM treatment caused a significant increase in BMK1 activity in unstimulated cells, confounding analysis of the results (not shown). Based on these findings it appears that calcium-dependent mechanisms are likely to be involved in regulation of BMK1 in VSMC. To determine whether activation of BMK1 by H2O2 was a ubiquitous characteristic, we determined the response to H2O2 in several different cell types. Cell lysates were prepared from HUVEC, HASM, HSF, and RASM cells, and Western blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 7A, a band of 110 kDa was present in all cell types studied with the greatest relative expression in HSF and RASM. In addition, a band of 112 kDa was present in the HASM. Next the response to H2O2 was determined. As shown in Fig. 7B, exposure to 200 µM H2O2 for 5 min stimulated increases in BMK1 activity in both HSF and RASM. Smaller responses were observed in HUVEC and HASM. Thus activation of BMK1 by H2O2 appears to be a characteristic feature in multiple cell types. The major finding of this paper is that H2O2 and osmotic stress activate BMK1 in VSMC. Although BMK1 has the same dual phosphorylation site (TEY) that is present in ERK1/2, regulation of BMK1 by hormonal and chemical stimuli is quite different from ERK1/2. The most potent stimuli for BMK1 were H2O2 and hyperosmolar stress (sorbitol). Although sorbitol also activated ERK1/2, H2O2 activated BMK1 but not ERK1/2 (similar to results we previously reported (13Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar)). In contrast, the most potent stimuli for ERK1/2 were AngII, PMA, PDGF, and TNF-α. These agonists failed to activate BMK1 significantly. These data indicate that the mechanism of activation of BMK1 is not identical to the ERK group of MAP kinases but is more similar to p38 and JNK/SAPK, which are activated by environmental stress. Zhou et al. (22Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12664-12669Google Scholar) cloned a new member of the MAPK/ERK kinase family termed MEK5. This kinase interacted with a kinase identical to BMK1 in the yeast two hybrid screen, which was termed ERK5 by these authors. They showed that MEK5 specifically interacted with BMK1 and that MEK1 was unable to interact with BMK1, suggesting that the MEK1/ERK1 pathway and the MEK5/BMK1(ERK5) pathways have different functions. The results of the present study support their concept. There also appear to be important differences in the activation of BMK1 compared with JNK and p38. For example, Raingeaud et al. (20Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar) showed that TNF-α was a powerful stimulus for both JNK and p38 in HeLa cells, whereas we observed no activation of BMK1 in VSMC treated with TNF-α. Thus the upstream kinases that regulate MKK3 and MKK4 are likely different from those that regulate MEK5. The fact that H2O2 was able to activate BMK1 but not ERK1/2 is of particular interest. We have previously demonstrated that oxidative stress, generated by xanthine and xanthine oxidase, stimulates VSMC DNA synthesis (32Rao G.N. Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2759-2764PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that H2O2 was able to stimulate c-fos expression (33Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, H2O2 was unable to activate ERK1/2 (13Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), suggesting that another kinase pathway was responsible for H2O2-mediated gene expression. BMK1 appears a likely mediator based on its rapid activation by H2O2 (peak at 5 min), its concentration dependence (peak at 200 µM H2O2, similar to the peak effect on c-fos induction), and its ability to stimulate BMK1 in multiple cell types. Thus BMK1 is a new candidate as a redox-sensitive kinase. We previously showed in VSMC that H2O2 and superoxide induced proto-oncogene mRNA expression in a protein kinase C-dependent manner (32Rao G.N. Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2759-2764PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, activation of ERK1/2 by superoxide is protein kinase C-dependent. In contrast, BMK1 was not activated by PMA, suggesting that a protein kinase C-independent pathway may be involved. Other investigators have reported that H2O2 and superoxide cause myocardial injury with intracellular calcium overload (34Josephson R.A. Silverman H.S. Lakatta E.G. Stern M.D. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2354-2361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depletion of intracellular calcium stores by thapsigargin treatment caused nearly complete inhibition of BMK1 activation by H2O2. Thus calcium-dependent tyrosine kinases, such as the recently described PYK2 (35Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar), may be important upstream activators of BMK1. Finally, previous investigators have suggested that Src may be an upstream mediator of redox-sensitive signal transduction (14Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Future work will be necessary to identify upstream mediators of H2O2-stimulated BMK1 activity. In summary, we have shown that BMK1 is present in VSMC and activated by both H2O2 and hyperosmolar stress. The hormonal and chemical mediators that activate BMK1 clearly differ from the mediators that activate ERK1/2, suggesting that these two classes of MAP kinases serve different intracellular functions. The exciting finding that BMK1 is activated by H2O2, whereas ERK1/2 are not suggests that BMK1 may represent a new class of redox-sensitive kinases.

https://openalex.org/W2106753244,"A cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE4D3) is activated in rat thyroid cells by TSH through a cAMP-dependent phosphorylation (Sette, C., Iona, S., and Conti, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 9245-9252). This short term activation may be involved in the termination of the hormonal stimulation and/or in the induction of desensitization. Here, we have further characterized the protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of this PDE4D3 variant and identified the phosphorylation site involved in the PDE activation. The PKA-dependent incorporation of phosphate in the partially purified, recombinant rat PDE4D3 followed a time course similar to that of activation. Half-maximal activation of the enzyme was obtained with 0.6 µM ATP and 30 nM of the catalytic subunit of PKA. Phosphorylation altered the Vmax of the PDE without affecting the Km for cAMP. Phosphorylation also modified the Mg2+ requirements and the pattern of inhibition by rolipram. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the 32P-labeled rat PDE4D3 yielded two or three major phosphopeptide bands, providing a first indication that the enzyme may be phosphorylated at multiple sites in a cell-free system. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the serine residues present at the amino terminus of this PDE in the context of preferred motifs for PKA phosphorylation. The PKA-dependent incorporation of 32P was reduced to the largest extent in mutants with both Ser13→ Ala and Ser54→ Ala substitutions, confirming the presence of more than one phosphorylation site in rat PDE4D3. While substitution of serine 13 with alanine did not affect the activation by PKA, substitution of Ser54 completely suppressed the kinase activation. Similar conclusions were reached with wild type and mutated PDE4D3 proteins expressed in MA-10 cells, where the endogenous PKA was activated by dibutyryl cAMP. Again, the PDE with the Ser54→ Ala substitution could not be activated by the endogenous PKA in the intact cell. These findings support the hypothesis that the PDE4D3 variant contains a regulatory domain target for phosphorylation at the amino terminus of the protein and that Ser54 in this domain plays a crucial role in activation.

To explore the effect of hypoxia upon endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (ecNOS) activity and expression, we exposed bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) to hypoxia (1% O2) for 0–24 h and measured levels of ecNOS mRNA, protein, and activity. The amount of ecNOS mRNA increases to more than twice the basal level after 6 h of hypoxia. Incubation of BAEC with actinomycin D during hypoxia prevents this increase, demonstrating that higher levels of mRNA observed during hypoxia are due to increased synthesis, not to increased stability of ecNOS mRNA. Levels of ecNOS protein increase throughout 24 h of hypoxia to more than twice normoxic levels. Although ecNOS expression increases within 2 h of hypoxia, total activity remains unchanged. To explore the transcriptional regulation of ecNOS, we constructed a reporter plasmid containing the ecNOS promoter region upstream of the luc gene and transfected this reporter plasmid into BAEC. In this system, hypoxia induces a linear increase over time in the expression of luciferase driven by the ecNOS promoter. It is concluded that hypoxia induces an increase in transcription of ecNOS in endothelial cells, activating the regulatory region of ecNOS by undefined transcription factors.

INTRODUCTIONSystemic arteries vasodilate in response to hypoxia, delivering more blood to peripheral tissues. This dilation occurs within seconds after hypoxia, and is maintained for hours. The molecular basis of hypoxic vasodilation is not completely understood. Possible mechanisms include direct relaxation of smooth muscle cells induced by changes in pH, ion channel conductance changes, and decreases in ATP levels. Endothelial cells may also release lower amounts of vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin or thromboxane, or may release increased amounts of vasodilators such as adenosine, prostacyclin, endothelial hyperpolarizing factor, and nitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NOnitric oxideNOSnitric-oxide synthaseecNOSendothelial nitric-oxide synthaseBAECbovine aortic endothelial cellsMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.

Thus, although ecNOS is called a “constitutive” isoform of NOS, its expression can be altered.Several studies have shown that hypoxia increases the synthesis of NO from systemic arteries both ex vivo (28Shaul P.W.

Sci. 1992; 50: 555-565Google Scholar). The effect of hypoxia on NO synthesis from endothelial cells in vitro is less clear; some studies report an increase, decrease, or no change (33McQuillan L.P.

These studies exposed cells isolated from systemic vessels to hypoxia for different periods of time, which may explain the different effects of hypoxia. An increase in NO synthesis during hypoxia could be due to increased levels of calcium prolonging the activation of ecNOS, post-translational modification increasing the activity of ecNOS, or an increase in ecNOS synthesis. One study has shown that hypoxia for 1 day decreases ecNOS levels in vitro (33McQuillan L.P. Leung G.K. Marsden P.A. Kostyk S.K. Kourembanas S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267(5): H1921-H1927Google Scholar), and another study has shown that hypoxia for 7 days increases ecNOS in vivo (36Shaul P.W. North A.J. Brannon T.S. Ujiie K. Wells L.B. Nisen P.A. Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Star R.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 167-174Google Scholar).In this study we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia induces the transcription of ecNOS. We show that hypoxia increases the amount of ecNOS mRNA and protein. Furthermore, we show that hypoxia can activate the transcription of a reporter gene under control of the ecNOS 5′-flanking region. However, while ecNOS levels increase, there is no increase in NOS activity in hypoxic cells.DISCUSSIONOur study provides several lines of evidence that hypoxia regulates ecNOS and its transcription. Hypoxia increases the levels of ecNOS mRNA and protein. The increase in ecNOS mRNA is not due to an increase in its stability, since this does not change during hypoxia. Hypoxia also increases transcription of a reporter gene driven by the ecNOS 5′-flanking region. Thus increased transcription produces more ecNOS during hypoxia.Our data suggest that the influence of NOS on vascular tone during hypoxia is complex. Others have shown that during acute hypoxia, intracellular calcium levels rise within minutes in endothelial cells (35Hampl V. Cornfield D.N. Cowan N.J. Archer S.L. Eur. Respir. J. 1995; 8: 515-522Google Scholar), which can activate ecNOS to synthesize NO. We show that during chronic hypoxia, more ecNOS is produced within hours, although total NOS activity does not change. The amount of NO synthesized during hypoxia in vivo is difficult to predict from our in vitro studies, since intracellular calcium concentrations, amount of ecNOS, and specific activity of ecNOS all influence NO synthesis. Furthermore, low levels of O2 might prolong the half-life of NO by reducing the rate at which NO and O2 combine to form NO2 (44Nguyen T. Brunson D. Crespi C.L. Penman B.W. Wishnok J.S.

John Wiley and Sons, New York1983: 1Google Scholar). The net effect of hypoxia upon vascular tone in vivo is the sum of many influences, including ecNOS levels and NO synthesis, other endogenous vasodilators, and vasoconstrictors.In contrast to our findings, others have reported that ecNOS mRNA levels actually decrease during hypoxia (33McQuillan L.P. Leung G.K. Marsden P.A. Kostyk S.K. Kourembanas S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267(5): H1921-H1927Google Scholar). The difference between our findings might be due to the different origins of the endothelial cells used: our study used endothelial cells isolated from aortas instead of from veins, and our cells are cloned. Furthermore, the other study only examined the effect of 48 h of hypoxia and might have missed the peak level of mRNA. We show that after rising initially, mRNA levels begin to decline after 24 h of hypoxia (although protein levels continue to increase), and it is possible that if this trend continues, then after 48 h of hypoxia the levels of mRNA in hypoxia cells are lower than in normoxic cells.Although ecNOS is expressed constitutively in resting endothelial cells, the level of ecNOS expression can be altered by various stimuli, including shear-stress, estrogen, and tumor necrosis factor-α (13Koller A.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 1177-1183Google Scholar). The DNA upstream from the ecNOS coding region contains potential regulatory sequences that may mediate control of ecNOS expression. For example, the 5′-flanking region includes the shear-stress response element (37Robinson L.J. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Michel T. Genomics. 1994; 19: 350-357Google Scholar, 49Marsden P.A. Heng H.H.

Schappert K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17478-17488Google Scholar). We have shown that hypoxia is another stimulus for ecNOS expression. Although we have established that ecNOS transcription is increased during hypoxia, the enhancer elements and transcription factors mediating this increase have not yet been identified. The 5′-region flanking the ecNOS gene does not contain an HIF-1 consensus sequence (24Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Google Scholar, 37Robinson L.J. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Michel T. Genomics. 1994; 19: 350-357Google Scholar). None of the consensus sequences in the 5′-flanking region are known to mediate hypoxic induction.The total activity of ecNOS is unchanged after 24 h of hypoxia, although the amount of enzyme has doubled. Why the activity does not increase along with the amount of enzyme is unclear: it is not due to a depletion of co-factors, since all co-factors are added exogenously for the NOS assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). ecNOS can be myristoylated, palmitoylated, and phosphorylated (50Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Google Scholar, 51Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether these modifications occur during hypoxia. None of these modifications have been shown to change the activity of ecNOS.Thus oxygen regulates the transcription of ecNOS. The transcription factors that sense hypoxia and activate transcription of ecNOS have not yet been identified. INTRODUCTIONSystemic arteries vasodilate in response to hypoxia, delivering more blood to peripheral tissues. This dilation occurs within seconds after hypoxia, and is maintained for hours. The molecular basis of hypoxic vasodilation is not completely understood. Possible mechanisms include direct relaxation of smooth muscle cells induced by changes in pH, ion channel conductance changes, and decreases in ATP levels. Endothelial cells may also release lower amounts of vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin or thromboxane, or may release increased amounts of vasodilators such as adenosine, prostacyclin, endothelial hyperpolarizing factor, and nitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NOnitric oxideNOSnitric-oxide synthaseecNOSendothelial nitric-oxide synthaseBAECbovine aortic endothelial cellsMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.

Using in-gel kinase assays and immunoprecipitation analyses we have shown that Ang II (10 nM-1 µM) elicits significant increases in p44MAPK (Erk1) and p42MAPK (Erk2) activities in cultured neurons, mediated via Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptors. This stimulatory effect of Ang II on Erk1 and Erk2 activities was potentiated by blockade of AT2 receptors with (S)-1-[4-(dimethylamino)-3-methylphenyl]methyl-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-C]pyridine-6-carboxylic acid (PD 123319, 1 µM). Furthermore, the AT2 receptor agonist N-α-nicotinoyl-Tyr-Lys-(N-αCBZ-Arg)-His-Pro-Ile-OH (CGP42112A) (10–50 nM) caused significant decreases in neuronal Erk1 and Erk2 activities, which were abolished by PD 123319 (1 µM) and by the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (3 nM). This indicates that AT1 and AT2 receptors have opposite actions on Erk1 and Erk2 activities in neonatal neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2049897189,"Binding of lutropin/choriogonadotropin to its cognate receptor results in the activation of adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C. The mechanism underlying the generation of this bifurcating signal is presently not known. To analyze the coupling mechanism of the LH receptor, activated G proteins were labeled with [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide and identified by selective immunoprecipitation. In membranes of bovine corpora lutea and of L cells stably expressing the murine LH receptor (LHR cells), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) led to incorporation of the label into αs and αi2. Stimulation of LHR cells or of L cells expressing the M5 muscarinic receptor (LM5 cells) with the respective agonist resulted in activation of phospholipase C in both cell lines. However, αq and α11 were only labeled upon stimulation of the M5 muscarinic receptor. Agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization and inositol phosphate accumulation were partially sensitive to pertussis toxin, and the expression of the βγ-stimulable phospholipase C isoforms β2 and β3 could be demonstrated in LHR cells. Overexpression of phospholipase C-β2 led to increased hCG-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation, and expression of a β-ARK1 C-terminal polypeptide effectively suppressed hCG-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. Thus, the LH receptor couples to both Gs and Gi, and βγ-subunits released from either G protein contribute to the stimulation of phospholipase C-β isoforms."

Magnesium-protoporphyrin chelatase catalyzes the insertion of Mg2+ into protoporphyrin IX, the first step unique to chlorophyll production, and lies at the branch point of the heme and chlorophyll biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 1). Consequently, it is an essential first step in the development of photosynthetic membranes.

In contrast, it has been possible to establish the identity of the genes encoding the magnesium chelatase enzyme in the purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Magnesium chelatase in this organism is encoded by the bchI, bchD, and bchH genes (9Gibson L.C.D. Willows R.D. Kannangara C.G. von Wettstein D. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the third gene has not been identified and characterized, and more generally, magnesium chelatase has not been studied at the biochemical and molecular level in a chlorophyll a-producing organism. The work described was carried out on the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 since this organism shares many features with higher plants. It synthesizes chlorophyll a and harbors an oxygen-evolving photosynthetic apparatus that, with exception of the peripheral light-harvesting complexes, is essentially identical to that of chloroplasts in plants and algae. At the same time, it retains the advantages of a prokaryote in terms of genome size and ease of genetic manipulation (see, for example, 16Kotani H. Kaneko T. Matsubayashi T. Sato S. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar and 17Kotani H. Tanaka A. Kaneko T. Sato S. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported the cloning and sequencing of a gene (chlH) homolog to bchH of Rhodobacter (18Jensen P.E. Stummann B.M. Henningsen K.W. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 1075-1076Crossref Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the cloning of chlI and chlD and present biochemical evidence that the ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH polypeptides together compose the magnesium chelatase enzyme of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803. Degenerate primers were designed from conserved regions of known CcsA/Ch42/ChlI sequences. One upstream primer (PI1) (see Fig. 3) was made from the amino acid motif IVGQDEMK, corresponding to 5′-ATCGT(G/C)GG(G/C)CA(G/A)GA(G/C)GAGATGAAG-3′. Two downstream primers were made from the motifs WNTVEREG (PI6) and NPEEGELR (PI7), corresponding to 5′-CCCTC(C/G)C(G/T)CTC(C/G)AC(G/C)GT-3′ and 5′-C(A/C)(G/C)AGGTC(G/C)CCCTCCTC(T/G/C)GGGTT-3′, respectively.

A genomic library in λGEM11 (Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom) was prepared from size-fractionated, partially Sau3AI-digested Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genomic DNA (used to isolate chlD). Another library (a generous gift from Dr. Klaus Steinmüller, Heinrich-Heine-Universität, Düsseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany) was used for isolation of the chlI gene. Library screening, phage DNA preparation, DNA manipulations, and hybridization were performed according to standard procedures (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strul K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar, 20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Double-stranded plasmids containing cloned gene fragments were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 373A sequencer and the Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit supplied by the manufacturer. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 394 RNA/DNA oligonucleotide synthesizer. A gene homolog to Rhodobacter bchH has already been cloned from Synechocystis PCC6803 (18Jensen P.E. Stummann B.M. Henningsen K.W. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 1075-1076Crossref Google Scholar). Specific oligonucleotides including the stop and start codons from the respective gene sequences were designed. These oligonucleotides were used to amplify the DNA by PCR and to introduce relevant restriction sites for cloning the PCR fragments into the pET vectors (21Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D.-S. Lin S.-W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), yielding plasmids pET9a-SynI, pET9a-SynD, and pET3a-SynH. E. coli BL21(DE3) strains containing pET3a/pET9a and their derivatives were grown at 25°C in 50 ml of LB medium (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 200 µg of ampicillin/ml (pET3a) or 20 µg of kanamycin/ml (pET9a) until the A600 of the cultures reached 0.6-1.0. Gene expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to the cultures at a final concentration of 0.4 mM. After 4-9 h, the cells were harvested, and the cell pellets were stored at −20°C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, purification of porphyrins, and magnesium-protoporphyrin chelatase assays were performed as described previously (9Gibson L.C.D. Willows R.D. Kannangara C.G. von Wettstein D. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission spectra of enzyme assays were recorded between 550 and 650 nm on a Spex Fluorolog spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 420 nm. For HPLC analysis, 200 µl of the assay mixture was extracted with 1.0 ml of 80% acetone containing 0.1 M NH3, mixed with 400 µl of hexane, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 3 min. The acetone phase was analyzed for porphyrins by HPLC using a Beckman Ultrasphere ODS column (150 × 4.6 mm). The column was eluted with a 10-min linear gradient from 15% solvent B to 100% solvent B at 1 ml/min. Solvent A contained 0.05% (v/v) triethylamine in water; solvent B contained acetonitrile. Porphyrins were detected using a Waters in-line fluorescence detector. Magnesium protoporphyrin IX was detected using an excitation wavelength of 420 ± 5 nm and an emission wavelength of 595 ± 5 nm. Gene homologs to the Rhodobacter bchI and bchH genes encoding magnesium chelatase subunits have been identified in algae and plants. However, no gene corresponding to the Rhodobacter bchD gene had been identified in any chlorophyll a-synthesizing organism, and it remained uncertain whether the magnesium chelatase of such organisms consists of three subunits as in Rhodobacter. The first stage in the cloning process relied upon the fact that there are some amino acid similarities between Rhodobacter capsulatus BchI and the amino-terminal region of BchD (see Fig. 3); in selected regions, the identity is 19-24% between BchD and the BchI/ChlI protein sequences from different organisms. Setting aside any possible functional significance, this homology provided a convenient location for the design of PCR primers, and in an attempt to exploit this conservation to clone a bchD homolog, we designed three oligonucleotides (PI1, PI6, and PI7) (see Fig. 3) whose sequences were based on amino acid sequence identities in the BchI homologs from Arabidopsis thaliana (10Koncz C. Mayerhofer R. Koncz-Kalman Z. Nawrath C. Reiss B. Redei G.P. Schell J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1337-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), Euglena gracilis (22Orsat B. Monfort A. Chatellard P. Stutz E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), Cryptomonas phi (EMBL accession no. Z21976), Olisthodiscus luteus (EMBL accession no. S32166), and R. capsulatus (23Armstrong G.A. Alberti M. Leach F. Hearst J.E. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Using these oligonucleotides as primers in PCR with Synechocystis PCC6803 genomic DNA as template, we obtained two different DNA fragments. With PI1 and PI6, a 483-base pair PCR fragment was obtained that was cloned (pSI) and sequenced. Comparison with the deduced amino acid sequences of the bchI gene of R. capsulatus and the ch42 gene of A. thaliana revealed 50 and 72% amino acid identities, respectively, and therefore most likely represented a Synechocystis homolog of these genes. With PI1 and PI7, a 564-base pair PCR fragment was obtained that, after cloning (pSX) and sequencing, displayed only 39% identity to the BchI and Ch42 proteins and could have represented either a second, less conserved homolog of bchI or a region of a new gene. The insert from each plasmid clone was used to screen genomic Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 libraries, and several independent λ clones were isolated. Restriction mapping, subcloning, and sequencing revealed that clones isolated using the insert from pSI did not overlap with clones isolated with the insert from pSX. A 2.3-kilobase region of λSI containing the entire open reading frame encoding the Synechocystis bchI homolog was sequenced (Fig. 2). This gene encodes a protein of 357 amino acids, with an estimated molecular mass of 39,629 Da and 51% overall identity to BchI of R. capsulatus and 69-73% identity to the plant and algal CcsA/Ch42 sequences. We propose that this gene should be called chlI. Of the genomic clones isolated with the insert of pSX, a 5.2-kilobase region was sequenced, and two major open reading frames were identified (Fig. 2). One of the open reading frames encodes a 393-amino acid polypeptide (45,468 Da), and data base comparisons revealed that it had some homology to a putative heme-binding protein (Hbp) known from the chloroplast genome of liverwort and higher plants. The other open reading frame had the potential to encode a 676-amino acid polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 73,699 Da. This reading frame showed an overall amino acid identity of 32% when compared with BchD of R. capsulatus. Based on this similarity and the enzymatic activity demonstrated below, we propose that this gene should be called chlD. Assignment of the Synechocystis chlI, chlD, and chlH genes on the physical map of the Synechocystis genome (16Kotani H. Kaneko T. Matsubayashi T. Sato S. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Kotani H. Tanaka A. Kaneko T. Sato S. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) revealed that chlI and chlD were clearly separated from each other and that chlorophyll biosynthesis genes in general are not clustered in Synechocystis (data not shown), unlike the situation in Rhodobacter sp. (24Zsebo K.M. Hearst J.E. Cell. 1984; 37: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Coomber S.A. Chaundri M. Connor A. Britton G. Hunter C.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A phosphate-binding motif (GX4GKSX6A, marked with asterisks above the BchI sequence in Fig. 3) common to a number of ATP-binding proteins is found near the N terminus (residues 47-54) of the deduced Synechocystis ChlI protein and in all the homolog sequences from R. capsulatus, algae, and plants. This indicates that the ChlI protein probably binds ATP or MgATP. Part of the motif is also found in ChlD (Fig. 3); whether this has any significance remains to be shown. The 32% identity between the putative ChlD protein of Synechocystis and the BchD protein of R. capsulatus is not particularly high in comparison with the identities between Synechocystis ChlI and ChlH and the corresponding R. capsulatus proteins, which are 51 and 41%, respectively. The similarity between the N-terminal regions of BchD and BchI noted earlier was again seen with Synechocystis ChlD, but now the homology was much more marked (Fig. 3). Thus, the deduced ChlD polypeptide sequence shares similarity with both BchI and BchD. The N-terminal part of ChlD (residues 1-326) displays 40-41% identity to BchI and ChlI and only 18% identity to the corresponding region in BchD. The C-terminal part of ChlD (residues 327-676) displays 33% identity to the corresponding region of BchD, and in this region, several stretches of identical amino acids between the two proteins can be found, which makes the relation between the two proteins obvious. As for BchD, Synechocystis ChlD has a proline-rich region that divides the protein into two major domains. In fact, the similarity between the N-terminal parts of ChlD and BchI ends just before this proline-rich region. Immediately following the proline-rich region of ChlD, a very acidic region is found; in a stretch of 40 amino acids, 19 residues are either aspartic acid or glutamic acid (Fig. 3). The overall homology between BchD and ChlD would not, in itself, give confidence that ChlD serves the same function as part of a magnesium chelatase. Thus, to establish the biochemical function of the chlD gene from Synechocystis, this gene was overexpressed in E. coli, along with the Synechocystis chlI and chlH genes. DNA fragments containing the chlI, chlH, and chlD genes were cloned separately into pET3a or pET9a, yielding plasmids pET9a-ChlI, pET9a-ChlD, and pET3a-ChlH, respectively, and the E. coli cultures containing these constructs were induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells from the respective inductions were disrupted, and the crude extracts were centrifuged; the resulting cell-free supernatants were used for all subsequent work. The supernatants contained the proteins that gave rise to magnesium chelatase activity, suggesting that the ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH proteins accumulated in a soluble form. This was further supported by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the different fractions. We found that induction of protein production at 25°C for 4 h yielded significantly more soluble protein, especially of ChlH and ChlD, than induction at 37°C. The ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH proteins are clearly visible on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, having apparent molecular masses of ∼40, 70, and 150 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4). This is in good accordance with the molecular masses deduced from the nucleotide sequences, which are 39,629, 73,699, and 148,659 Da, respectively. In contrast to the expression of the R. sphaeroides bchD gene in E. coli (9Gibson L.C.D. Willows R.D. Kannangara C.G. von Wettstein D. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we observed significant expression of the Synechocystis chlD gene in E. coli. We estimate that overexpressed ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH compose ∼30-40% of the total soluble protein in the E. coli cell after 4 h of induction. Cell-free extracts prepared from E. coli strains containing ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH were mixed in various combinations and incubated with protoporphyrin IX, Mg2+, and ATP in a regenerating system in order to establish the combination of proteins that gave rise to magnesium chelatase activity. Formation of magnesium protoporphyrin IX in these assays was established by fluorescence emission spectroscopy. The fluorescence emission spectra of the assays after 30 min of incubation are shown in Fig. 5. Magnesium protoporphyrin IX has a characteristic emission maximum at 595 nm (Fig. 5, trace MgP), whereas the substrate has an emission maximum at 633 nm. The emission maximum at 595 nm is clearly present in the sample containing all three proteins (Fig. 5, trace I+D+H) and not in any of the other assays. The emission maximum at 595 nm is identical to that of the authentic magnesium protoporphyrin IX control (Fig. 5, trace MgP). In addition, the identity of the product formed in the ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH incubation was verified by HPLC; the retention times of authentic magnesium protoporphyrin IX and the product of the reaction are identical, demonstrating that the product formed is magnesium protoporphyrin IX (Fig. 6). An assay containing ChlI, ChlD, ChlH, Mg2+, and protoporphyrin IX, but no ATP, was also performed. In Fig. 7, the fluorescence emission spectrum of this assay is compared with that of an assay containing ATP, and it is clear that the Synechocystis magnesium chelatase is ATP-dependent. Using the cell-free extracts and by roughly estimating the fraction of the overexpressed protein in these, we found that the molar ratio of the three components yielding optimal catalytic activity is approximately 10 ChlI:1 ChlD:10 ChlH.Fig. 6HPLC identification of the product formed in magnesium chelatase assays containing ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH.

Thus, magnesium chelatase in Synechocystis PCC6803 consists of three components: the ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH proteins with deduced molecular masses of 39,629, 73,699, and 148,659 Da, respectively. When the genes are overexpressed in E. coli, the cell-free extracts contain significant levels of the overproduced proteins (Fig. 4). When the extracts containing these proteins are mixed, an active chelatase enzyme forms, and it has been demonstrated that this enzyme catalyzes the chelation of magnesium by protoporphyrin IX in an ATP-dependent manner. It has also been demonstrated that there is an equivalent of the BchD protein, a subunit of the bacteriochlorophyll a-specific magnesium chelatase, in a chlorophyll a-synthesizing organism. The primary structure of the Synechocystis ChlD protein reveals some interesting features (Fig. 3). The amino-terminal 326 residues of ChlD displays 40-41% amino acid identity to the BchI and ChlI proteins of R. capsulatus and Synechocystis. This indicates an evolutionary relationship between “I” and “D” genes; it is possible that the D gene originated from a fusion between a duplicated I gene (the N-terminal part) and an ancestral D gene (the C-terminal part). The conserved motifs between ChlD and BchD/BchI probably represent residues with structural and/or functional importance. The Synechocystis ChlD protein sequence is clearly divided into two major domains separated by the proline-rich sequence. A sequence of four or more prolines in a row adopts a single preferred conformation in solution, known as the polyproline II helix (26Cowan P.M. McGavin S. Nature. 1955; 176: 501-503Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This is an extended structure with three residues/turn, and in proteins, they generally form a rigid stem that protrudes from membranes or globular proteins (27Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Although in many proteins the function of the proline-rich region remains uncertain, in some cases, it is involved in interaction with other proteins or cofactors; in other cases, the function is structural, by separating the protein into two domains (reviewed in 27Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). In ChlD, both functions could be relevant; ChlD is divided into two major domains separated by the proline-rich region, and ChlD has to interact with at least one other protein component in the magnesium chelatase enzyme. The amino acid sequence of ChlD has no long hydrophobic regions that could suggest membrane association. On the basis of their amino acid sequences, ChlI and ChlH also appear to be soluble, and it seems likely that magnesium chelatase is soluble. This is further supported by results obtained with pea and cucumber magnesium chelatases, which show no indication of being membrane proteins since the activity is readily solubilized by washing the total chloroplast membranes in buffer of low MgCl2 content (28Walker C.J. Weinstein J.D. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 94: 419-424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). With respect to the number of different protein subunits, subunit sizes, and the absolute ATP requirement, the Synechocystis magnesium chelatase parallels the R. sphaeroides magnesium chelatase (9Gibson L.C.D. Willows R.D. Kannangara C.G. von Wettstein D. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, the magnesium chelatase enzyme is conserved between purple bacteria and cyanobacteria. The Synechocystis ChlI, ChlD, and ChlH polypeptides are clearly related to BchI, BchD, and BchH of R. sphaeroides. However, it is possible that the subunit interactions and the stoichiometry between subunits are different for the two enzymes. Biochemical studies on magnesium chelatase from pea chloroplasts implied that the enzyme was of a multicomponent nature (8Walker C.J. Weinstein J.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The data presented here show that the magnesium chelatase of Synechocystis, and probably also of higher plants, consists of three different polypeptides and thereby demonstrate the multicomponent nature of this enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2159577930,"Neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) is an autosomal recessive disorder in which excess triacylglycerol (TG) accumulates in most cells. Although it has been hypothesized that the TG accumulation is caused by a functional defect in cytosolic lipase activity, we were able to expose TG hydrolysis in NLSD cells by using triacsin C, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthetase that blocks the reincorporation of hydrolyzed fatty acids into glycerolipids. Our data suggest that TG lipolysis in NLSD cells is masked by rapid TG resynthesis, occurring because released acylglycerols cannot be used for phospholipid synthesis. In uptake studies, triacsin C blocked the incorporation of [3H]glycerol into glycerolipids, incorporation of [14C]oleate into TG, but not incorporation of [14C]oleate into phospholipid. Thus, the drug inhibited both de novo synthesis of glycerolipids via the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway and the synthesis of TG from diacylglycerol. The drug did not appear to block reacylation of lysophospholipids. Triacsin C caused a loss of about 60% of the TG mass from both NLSD and oleate-loaded control cells. Rates of TG lipolysis were similar in NLSD cells and oleate-loaded control cells labeled with [6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-amino]hexanoic acid or labeled with [14C]oleate or [3H]glycerol and chased in the presence of triacsin C. During a 96-h chase, [14C]oleate reincorporation into the different phospholipid species increased only in control cells. Similar results were observed when NLSD, and control cells were chased after labeling with [3H]glycerol. These data strongly suggest that normal human fibroblasts mobilize stored TG for phospholipid synthesis and that recycling to PC occurs via a TG-derived mono- or diacylglycerol intermediate. Normal recycling to phosphatidylethanolamine may primarily involve TG-derived acyl groups rather than an acylglycerol precursor. NLSD cells appear to have a block in this recycling pathway with the result that both hydrolyzed fatty acids and the acylglycerol backbone are re-esterified to form TG. Because the NLSD phenotype includes ichthyosis, fatty liver, myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and mental retardation, the recycling pathway appears to be critical for the normal function of skin, liver, muscle, heart, and the central nervous system.

The promoter of the rat PGS-2 gene contains a CAAT enhancer-binding protein consensus site (CAAT box) which can confer hormone inducibility to a PGS-2·CAT reporter gene, as well as a putative E-box region. To determine if the E-box region was involved in hormone induced trans-activation of the rat PGS-2 gene, constructs with the CAAT box and E-box regions (−192 PGS-2·CAT), only the putative E-box (−110 PGS-2·CAT), or neither region (−52 PGS-2·CAT) were transiently transfected into rat granulosa cell cultures. CAT activity was induced in both the −192 and −110 PGS-2·CAT vectors by luteinizing hormone (10-fold) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (6-fold), whereas CAT activity of the −52 PGS-2·CAT construct did not differ from the promoterless vector (pCAT-Basic). Deletion of 1 base pair from the E-box within the −110 PGS-2·CAT construct, as well as point mutations within the CAAT box, E-box, or both regions of the −192 PGS-2·CAT construct, demonstrated that the E-box is critical for basal transcription, and that regions, in addition to the CAAT box, are involved in hormone induction of the PGS-2 gene. An oligonucleotide spanning the rat PGS-2 E-box bound two specific protein complexes which were supershifted in the presence of antibody specific for the upstream stimulatory factor. Thus, in rat granulosa cells, the PGS-2 E-box region appears to interact with upstream cis-acting elements other than the CAAT box to confer hormonal regulation of the gene. The E-box region of the rat PGS-2 promoter does not contain ATF/CRE activity found in the human and mouse PGS-2 promoters, but is critical for basal transcription of the PGS-2 gene in rat granulosa cells and binds the upstream stimulatory factor (as do E-box regions of other genes regulated in the ovary). The prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGS-2) gene encodes an isoform of prostaglandin synthase that is transiently induced by protein kinase A (luteinizing hormone/cAMP) and protein kinase C (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonists in granulosa cells of ovulating follicles. The promoter of the rat PGS-2 gene contains a CAAT enhancer-binding protein consensus site (CAAT box) which can confer hormone inducibility to a PGS-2·CAT reporter gene, as well as a putative E-box region. To determine if the E-box region was involved in hormone induced trans-activation of the rat PGS-2 gene, constructs with the CAAT box and E-box regions (−192 PGS-2·CAT), only the putative E-box (−110 PGS-2·CAT), or neither region (−52 PGS-2·CAT) were transiently transfected into rat granulosa cell cultures.

We previously reported the unexpected agonistic properties of these hPRL analogs in the rat Nb2 bioassay (Goffin, V., Struman, I., Mainfroid, V., Kinet, S., and Martial, J. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 32598-32606). In order to investigate whether such paradoxical agonistic behavior might result from characteristic features of the Nb2 assay (e.g. species specificity), we transfected in the same cell system the cDNA encoding the PRLR from rat or human species along with reporter genes containing PRL-responsive DNA sequences. We characterized the agonistic, self-antagonistic and/or antagonistic effects of wild type rat PRL, wild type hPRL, and three hPRL analogs, mutated either at binding site 1 or at binding site 2. Our results clearly show that the agonistic/antagonistic properties of PRLs are species-specific. We thus propose different models of receptor activation, depending on the relative affinities of each hormonal binding site, which is directed by species specificity.

These bioactivities are mediated by homologous membrane receptors, the PRL receptor (PRLR), also known as the lactogen receptor, and the GH receptor (GHR), also referred to as the somatogen receptor. Both belong to the cytokine receptor superfamily (for reviews, see 4Kelly P.A. Djiane J. Postel-Vinay M.-C. Edery M. Endocr.

Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) and structural (8de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) studies have demonstrated that a single human GH (hGH) molecule binds to two molecules of hGH binding protein (hGHbp) through two regions referred to as binding sites 1 and 2. Binding site 1 is delimited by a pocket encompassed within helix 1, helix 4, and loop 1, whereas binding site 2 involves a cleft delimited by the opposite side of helix 1 and helix 3 as well as few residues of the N terminus. A sequential dimerization model for membrane-bound receptor has been proposed (9Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In a first step, one hGH molecule binds to one hGHR molecule through its site 1 to form a 1:1 ligand-receptor complex that remains inactive. In a second step, the hGH involved in this intermediate 1:1 complex binds, through its site 2, to a second hGHR molecule, and an active 1:2 hormone-receptor complex results. For the PRLR, a similar mechanism of receptor activation is anticipated, since we have identified on hPRL two binding sites involving regions of the protein topologically equivalent to those forming the binding sites of hGH (10Goffin V.

Moreover, the hGH-hGHbp and hGH-hPRLbp 1:1 complexes were found to have very similar overall structures (8de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a GHR antagonist has been designed. By replacing the hydrogen side chain of Gly120 (helix 3) in hGH with the much larger side chain of an Arg (so-called G120R hGH analog), the cleft within the helix 1/helix 3 interface is sterically hindered, and this analog, unable to induce receptor dimerization, fails to exhibit any agonistic activity (9Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Conversely, it acts at high concentrations as an antagonist of WT hGH by blocking hormone-receptor complexes in the inactive 1:1 stoichiometry (9Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The conservation of the helix 3 glycine within the PRL/GH family (19Nicoll C.S. Mayer G.L. Russell S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 169-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) argues for a conserved functional role of this residue in maintaining the cleft at binding site 2. In agreement, the antagonistic properties of such GH analogs, first assessed on the GHR from humans (9Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), were then observed on rat and mice GHR (20Ilondo M.M. Damholt A.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. De Meyts P. Shymko R.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we recently showed that the G129R hPRL analog (homologous to G120R hGH) failed to antagonize hPRL-induced proliferation of rat Nb2 cells (12Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led us to postulate that the mechanism of PRLR dimerization shows some differences depending on the intrinsic properties of PRL versus GH (12Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Within the past 2 years, however, conflicting data have been reported that question the ubiquitous antagonistic properties of GH analogs mutated at binding site 2. First, a recent report demonstrates that the G120R hGH analog actually acts as an agonist on rat Nb2 cells in the absence of zinc ions (23Dattani M.T. Hindmarsh P.C. Brook C.G.D. Robinson I.C.A. Kopchick J.J. Marshall N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9222-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Second, Mode et al. (24Mode A. Tollet P. Wlees T. Carmignac D.F. Clarck R.G. Chen W.Y. Kopchick J.J. Robinson I.C.A.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 447-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) failed to observe any GHR antagonism of the hGH G120R analog when infused in rats but moreover found that this variant displayed agonistic activity via the PRLR. Third, although the I4A hGH analog is poorly able to dimerize the hGHbp in vitro (7Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), it acts as a perfect GH agonist in transgenic mice (25Chen W.Y. Chen N.Y. Yun J. Wagner T.E. Kopchick J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15892-15897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chen W.Y. Chen N.Y. Yun J. Wight D.C. Wang X.Z. Wagner T.E. Kopchick J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 292-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, a hGH variant lacking the first seven N-terminal residues displayed full agonistic activity in the rat Nb2 assay (27Binder L. Gertler A. Elberg G. Guy R. Vogel T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the antagonistic properties of PRL/GH analogs mutated at binding site 2 might not only depend on the properties of the hormones themselves, as usually expected, but also on some features (e.g. species specificity, sensitivity) of the bioassays used for their functional characterization.Studies on lactogens are most often performed using the rat Nb2 cell proliferation bioassay (10Goffin V.

In order to investigate if the use of this bioassay might be misleading for assessing antagonistic properties of lactogen analogs, such as G129R hPRL (12Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have analyzed several PRLs, wild type (WT) or mutated, using an in vitro bioassay in which the transcriptional activation of PRL-responsive reporter genes is mediated by exogenous PRLR from rat or human species, which allows their comparison in a strictly identical cell system. Our data clearly show that (i) the rat PRLR displays a higher affinity than human PRLR for binding site 2 of PRLs, (ii) consequently, the agonistic and antagonistic properties of a given analog are driven by species specific features, and (iii) the hPRL analog G129R displays antagonistic properties on PRLR from both species, in contradiction to what we previously observed using the Nb2 proliferation bioassay (12Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we recently showed that the G129R hPRL analog (homologous to G120R hGH) failed to antagonize hPRL-induced proliferation of rat Nb2 cells (12Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led us to postulate that the mechanism of PRLR dimerization shows some differences depending on the intrinsic properties of PRL versus GH (12Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Within the past 2 years, however, conflicting data have been reported that question the ubiquitous antagonistic properties of GH analogs mutated at binding site 2. First, a recent report demonstrates that the G120R hGH analog actually acts as an agonist on rat Nb2 cells in the absence of zinc ions (23Dattani M.T. Hindmarsh P.C. Brook C.G.D. Robinson I.C.A. Kopchick J.J. Marshall N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9222-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Second, Mode et al. (24Mode A. Tollet P. Wlees T. Carmignac D.F. Clarck R.G. Chen W.Y. Kopchick J.J. Robinson I.C.A.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 447-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) failed to observe any GHR antagonism of the hGH G120R analog when infused in rats but moreover found that this variant displayed agonistic activity via the PRLR. Third, although the I4A hGH analog is poorly able to dimerize the hGHbp in vitro (7Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), it acts as a perfect GH agonist in transgenic mice (25Chen W.Y. Chen N.Y. Yun J. Wagner T.E. Kopchick J.J. J. Biol.

Gertler A. Elberg G. Guy R. Vogel T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the antagonistic properties of PRL/GH analogs mutated at binding site 2 might not only depend on the properties of the hormones themselves, as usually expected, but also on some features (e.g. species specificity, sensitivity) of the bioassays used for their functional characterization.Studies on lactogens are most often performed using the rat Nb2 cell proliferation bioassay (10Goffin V.

In order to investigate if the use of this bioassay might be misleading for assessing antagonistic properties of lactogen analogs, such as G129R hPRL (12Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have analyzed several PRLs, wild type (WT) or mutated, using an in vitro bioassay in which the transcriptional activation of PRL-responsive reporter genes is mediated by exogenous PRLR from rat or human species, which allows their comparison in a strictly identical cell system. Our data clearly show that (i) the rat PRLR displays a higher affinity than human PRLR for binding site 2 of PRLs, (ii) consequently, the agonistic and antagonistic properties of a given analog are driven by species specific features, and (iii) the hPRL analog G129R displays antagonistic properties on PRLR from both species, in contradiction to what we previously observed using the Nb2 proliferation bioassay (12Goffin V.

Site-directed mutagenesis of this element in the context of a COL1A1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct extending to −3518 base pairs decreased the ratio of reporter gene activity in calvariae to tendon from 3:1 to 1:1, suggesting a preferential effect on activity in calvariae. Moreover, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-specific immunofluorescence microscopy of transgenic calvariae showed that the mutation preferentially reduced levels of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein in differentiated osteoblasts. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrate that differentiated osteoblasts contain a nuclear factor that binds to this site. This binding activity is not present in undifferentiated osteoblasts. We show that Msx2, a homeodomain protein, binds to this motif; however, Northern blot analysis revealed that Msx2 mRNA is present in undifferentiated bone cells but not in fully differentiated osteoblasts. In addition, cotransfection studies in ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells using an Msx2 expression vector showed that Msx2 inhibits a COL1A1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct.

In the present study we investigated the regulation of IL-8 gene expression by IL-1β, osteotropic hormones, and protein kinase inhibitors in primary cultures of HBMS cells. The treatment of HBMS cells with IL-1β increased the steady-state levels of IL-8 mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent fashion and was detectable within 1 h, reached maximal by 4 h, and remained elevated at 24 h, whereas parathyroid hormone (10−7 and 10−8M) had no effect on IL-8 mRNA. Both synthetic and natural glucocorticoids dexamethasone (10−7-10−10M) and hydrocortisone (10−6-10−8M) inhibited IL-1β-stimulated IL-8 mRNA expression. The suppressive effect of dexamethasone on IL-1β-induced IL-8 mRNA was not observed in the presence of cycloheximide (5 µg/ml), indicating that the dexamethasone-mediated repression of IL-8 gene expression also depends on new protein synthesis. Experiments with actinomycin D demonstrated that IL-8 mRNA is long-lived and that glucocorticoids down-regulate IL-8 gene expression mainly by decreasing the mRNA stability in normal HBMS cells. Furthermore, as determined by nuclear run-on analysis, IL-1β increased the rate of transcription of IL-8 gene and dexamethasone did not affect the IL-1β-induced transcription of IL-8. 1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, HCl (50 µM) and staurosporine (1 µM), potent inhibitors of protein kinase C, and genistein (100 µM), a specific protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocked IL-1β-induced IL-8 gene expression. Because curcumin (20 µM), an inhibitor of c-jun/AP-1 and protein kinases, also blocked IL-1β-stimulated IL-8 gene expression implicating c-JUN/AP-1 and protein phosphorylation in the induction of IL-8 gene expression by IL-1β, we conclude that the regulation of IL-8 mRNA by IL-1β is mediated via protein kinase-dependent signal transduction pathways.

The beads were then washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The Jurkat cell extract was prepared by spinning down J25 cells (11Luria S. Chambers I. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5326-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 5 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5). The cells were then sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was then precleared with 30 µl of GST-labeled glutathione beads for 30 min at 4°C. To detect kinase activity, the washed beads were used in a PKC kinase assay similar to that previously described (27Mochly-Rosen D. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2291-2297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the reaction was carried out at room temperature for 5 min, and the mixture was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose squares, which were then washed with water and methanol before counting. In the assay, the labeled beads were incubated with a solution containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl2, 20 µM ATP, 12 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 5 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, 15 µM substrate peptide, plus or minus 50 µg/ml phosphotidylserine and 0.8 µg/ml diacylglycerol, plus or minus 20 mM CaCl2 or EGTA, and plus or minus 50 µg/ml pseudosubstrate peptide (28House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). A peptide based upon the PKC pseudosubstrate sequence (25Baier G. Telford D. Giampa L. Coggeshall K.M. Baier-Bitterlich G. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4997-5004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the alanine replaced with a serine was used as the substrate (Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility, Stanford). For the Western blot analysis of PKC isozymes bound to the GST fusion proteins, samples were extracted using glutathione beads prelabeled with GST or GST-Nef fusion proteins as described above. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer was added to the washed beads to extract the bound proteins for Western analysis as described previously (29Mochly-Rosen D. Heinrich C.J. Cheever L. Khaner H. Simpson P.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1990; 1: 693-706Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Extract from 1 × 106 cells was also run along with the purified proteins for comparison. The nitrocellulose membranes were probed with antibodies for α, β, ε, ζ, and θPKC isozymes (the α and β monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Seikagaku America; the ε and ζ polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc./BRL; and the θ monoclonal antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories). The monoclonal antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution, whereas the polyclonal antibodies were diluted 1:300. Previous experiments found that these were the most abundant PKC isozymes in these cells. The Western blots were developed using chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Corp.). Immunoprecipitations were performed on the 0.1% Triton X-100 extracts of approximately 5 × 107 Jurkat cells that had or had not been exposed to PMA and PHA for 5 min. Cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml PMA (Sigma) and 2 µg/ml PHA (Sigma). The Nef-1-expressing cell line (133) and the J25 parent cell line were used for the immunoprecipitations. Construction of cell lines and their culture are described in Luria et al. (11Luria S. Chambers I. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5326-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, the cell extracts were prepared as above, except for the addition of 0.1% Triton. 6-8 µl of antibodies to Nef (11Luria S. Chambers I. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5326-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), θPKC (a generous gift from Isakov and Altman (19Isakov N. Altman A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3100-3107PubMed Google Scholar)) or rabbit preimmune serum were incubated with the extracts for 2 h. The antibody-antigen complex was then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia). Alternatively, the antibodies were biotinylated with SS-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) in order to prevent the immunoglobulin from disassociating with the other proteins in the extraction step. The antibody-antigen-biotin complex was then precipitated with avidin coupled to agarose (Pierce). The antigen complex was extracted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Precipitated proteins were detected by Western analysis. To determine the translocation of PKC isozymes (30Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 31Tsutsumi A. Kubo M. Fugii H. Freire-Moar J. Turck C.W. Ransom J.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1746-1754PubMed Google Scholar), equal amounts of protein (as determined by Bradford assays; Bio-Rad) from the cytosolic and Triton soluble particulate fractions of unstimulated and stimulated cells were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for Western analysis for β, ε, ζ, and θPKC isozymes. The cellular fractions were produced from cell homogenates by a 30-min 100,000 × g centrifugation followed by a 0.1% Triton extraction of the pellet and recentrifugation. The supernatant from the final centrifugation was used as the Triton soluble particulate fraction. The larger molecular weight protein detected by the antibody to ζPKC, which translocates with stimulation, may be α or βPKC as reported by others (32Allen B.G. Andrea J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29288-29298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Triton soluble particulate fraction does not contain the nuclei or other cellular components not extracted with 0.1% Triton. Western analysis of the Triton nonextracted pellet from unstimulated or stimulated cells revealed little θPKC remaining in the pellet (results not shown). To test for an interaction between Nef and PKC, Nef was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli, purified by adsorption on glutathione-agarose beads, and incubated with the cytosolic fraction of Jurkat cells. PKC associated with the GST-Nef fusion protein was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of a specific PKC substrate peptide (Fig. 1). PKC activity was readily detected in the proteins extracted with GST-Nef but not with GST. Phosphorylation occurred only in the presence of PKC activators and was inhibited by a specific PKC inhibitor, the PKC pseudosubstrate peptide (28House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Maximal phosphorylation activity occurred in the presence of phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and EGTA, suggesting that a calcium-independent PKC isozyme binds Nef. A decrease in kinase activity in the presence of calcium was not observed in all experiments and may be the result of increased degradation of the enzyme due to the calcium in some of the experiments. The PKC family consists of at least eleven isozymes (33Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), five of which (α, β, ε, θ, and ζ) were clearly detected by Western blot analysis in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2A, cytosol). To identify which PKC isozyme bound to Nef, the purified GST-Nef and associated proteins recovered after incubation with Jurkat cell cytosol were electrophoresed, and the protein blots were analyzed with antisera specific for the five PKC isozymes (Fig. 2A). Of the five PKC isozymes detected in Jurkat cells, only θPKC bound to the GST-Nef fusion protein; lower amounts of the PKC isozymes bound to GST alone due to nonspecific interactions. Further evidence supporting our conclusion that θPKC binds Nef is the observation that the addition of increasing amounts of purified, unbound Nef proportionally lowered the binding of θPKC to the fusion protein (Fig. 2B). In addition, treatment of the GST-Nef fusion protein with thrombin, which cleaves Nef from GST, eliminated the binding of θPKC to the glutathione beads (results not shown). We have noted that under our conditions only a fraction of the cytosolic θPKC (about 5%) is bound to the GST-Nef, even though the amount of GST-Nef is in molar excess over the amount of θPKC. In addition, PKC activators phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol were present in sufficient concentrations to fully activate the PKC. Moreover, when the cytosolic fraction, which had already been reacted with GST-Nef, was reincubated with fresh GST-Nef, there was no additional binding of θPKC. This suggests that θPKC in the cytosolic fraction is heterogeneous with respect to its ability to bind Nef. Co-incubation of PKC with phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and some isozymes with calcium as well results in a conformational change in the protein that allows for substrate phosphorylation and binding to RACKs or other PKC binding proteins (23Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 28House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine if θPKC needs to be activated to bind Nef. To this end GST-Nef, immobilized on glutathione beads, was incubated with Jurkat cell cytosol in the presence or the absence of PKC activators. The recovered binding proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). Binding of θPKC was maximal in the presence of phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and EGTA, consistent with the results obtained with the PKC kinase assay (Fig. 1). Nef has been reported to be a PKC substrate (34Coates K. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the interaction between θPKC and Nef was not via the PKC substrate binding site. Similar to PKC binding to other proteins that have been shown to interact with PKC such as RACKs (21Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 22Ron D. Chen C. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), a PKC peudosubstrate peptide did not inhibit Nef binding to θPKC (Fig. 3). Another approach to determine the association of Nef with θPKC relied on co-immunoprecipitation. Antibodies directed against Nef immunoprecipitated both Nef and θPKC from extracts of Jurkat cells that express Nef (Fig. 4A). By contrast, βPKC was not co-precipitated with anti-Nef antibodies (results not shown), nor did preimmune serum or protein A-Sepharose beads alone precipitate Nef or θPKC (Fig. 4A). PMA and PHA stimulation of the Nef-expressing cells did not affect the amount of θPKC that co-precipitated with Nef. Considering that the cells are grown in media containing growth factors, it is possible that there is a sufficient amount of activated θPKC to associate with the endogenously produced Nef; such a possibility is inferred from the observation that some particulate fraction-associated θPKC is usually present in Nef-expressing Jurkat cells even before stimulation. Treatment of the Jurkat cell extracts with various preparations of antibodies to θPKC immunoprecipitated θPKC but failed to co-precipitate detectable levels of Nef using protein A-Sepharose (Fig. 4A). However, Nef could be co-immunoprecipitated with θPKC using biotinylated antibodies to θPKC and avidin-agarose (Fig. 4B). Using biotinylated antibodies removed the background signal resulting from the immunoglobulin light chain that migrated at the same molecular weight as Nef on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This method greatly improved the sensitivity of the Western for immunoprecipitated Nef but also lowered the amount of antigen that was precipitated. In particular, biotinylated antibodies to Nef did not consistently co-precipitate θPKC (Fig. 4B), possibly because of interference by the biotin on the binding of the antibodies to the complex. In vivo activation of PKC generally results in the translocation of the isozymes from the cytosol to the particulate fraction with no net change in the total amount of the enzymes (30Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 31Tsutsumi A. Kubo M. Fugii H. Freire-Moar J. Turck C.W. Ransom J.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1746-1754PubMed Google Scholar). However, in Jurkat cells expressing Nef, the total amount of θPKC declined after 5 min of PMA and PHA stimulation (Fig. 5A); by comparison the total level of βPKC remained unchanged after stimulation. To examine this isozyme-specific difference further, the translocation of four PKC isozymes was compared in PMA- and PHA-activated control and Nef-expressing Jurkat cells (Fig. 5B). Translocation of β, ε, and θPKC isozymes was observed after 5 min of PMA and PHA stimulation in the control Jurkat cells; translocation of the β and ε isozymes was virtually unchanged in the Jurkat cells expressing Nef (ζPKC localization is unaffected by PMA, whereas the higher molecular weight cross-reactive proteins may be other PKC isozymes (32Allen B.G. Andrea J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29288-29298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). However, θPKC translocation was disrupted in the cells expressing Nef; stimulation resulted in the loss of θPKC from the cytosolic fraction without a concomitant increase in the level of θPKC in the particulate fraction. Furthermore, as pointed out earlier, even without stimulation, there was a greater proportion of θPKC in the particulate fraction of Nef-expressing cells than in control cells (Fig. 5B). The loss of θPKC following PMA and PHA treatment of Nef-expressing cells may be a result of the isozyme's interaction with Nef. This could result from the failure of θPKC to bind to its endogenous anchoring protein(s) or RACKs (21Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 22Ron D. Chen C. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activated PKC has been shown to be more sensitive to proteolysis (36Kishimoto A. Kajikawa N. Shiota M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1156-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of binding of activated PKC to its endogenous binding proteins or RACKs may leave the PKC more susceptible to degradation. Indeed, an inhibition of translocation and a net loss of PKC following activation was observed in oocytes in which translocation inhibitors (either a purified RACK protein or peptides based upon sites of interaction between PKC and RACKs) were introduced by microinjection (35Smith B.L. Mochly-Rosen D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 37Ron D. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Nef may act as an inhibitor of θPKC translocation in lymphocytes in a similar manner. Quite possibly, the loss of θPKC or its inappropriate binding to its targets could account for the various phenotypic impairments of T cell function associated with Nef and HIV infection. Further work is required to determine the molecular basis for the loss of θPKC in cells expressing Nef and how this disruption in signal transduction affects T cell activation."

The first helical region was formed by an N-terminal amphipathic α-helix, and the second consisted of multiple overlapping turns and contained a distinct compact, hydrophobic, tryptophan-rich domain (residues 14-20). Chimeric molecules, formed between the N-terminal region of RD1 and the soluble bacterial protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, were used in an in vitro system to determine the features within the splice region that were required for membrane association. The ability of RD1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase chimera to become membrane-associated was not affected by deletion of any of the following regions: the apolar section (residues 2-7) of the first helical region, the polar part of this region together with the hinge region (residues 8-13), or the polar end of the C-terminal helical region (residues 21-25). In marked contrast, deletion of the compact, hydrophobic tryptophan-rich domain (residues 14-20) found in the second helical region obliterated membrane association. Replacement of this domain with a hydrophobic cassette of seven alanine residues also abolished membrane association, indicating that membrane-association occurred by virtue of specific hydrophobic interactions with residues within the compact, tryptophan-rich domain. The structure of this domain is well defined in the peptide, and although the region is helical, both the backbone and the distribution of side chains are somewhat distorted as compared with an ideal α-helix. Hydrophobic interactions, such as the “stacked” rings of residues Pro14 and Trp15, stabilize this domain with the side chain of residue Leu16 adopting a central position, interacting with the side chains of all three tryptophan residues 15, 19, and 20. These bulky side chains thus form a hydrophobic cluster. In contrast, the side chain of residue Val17 is relatively exposed, pointing out from the opposite “face” of the peptide. Although it appears that this compact, tryptophan-rich domain is responsible for membrane association, at present the target site and hence the specific interactions involved in membrane targeting by the RD1 splice region remain unidentified. A 25-residue peptide representing the membrane targeting N-terminal splice region of the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase RD1 (RNPDE4A1) was synthesized, and its structure was determined by 1H NMR. Two independently folding helical regions were identified, separated by a highly mobile “hinge” region. The first helical region was formed by an N-terminal amphipathic α-helix, and the second consisted of multiple overlapping turns and contained a distinct compact, hydrophobic, tryptophan-rich domain (residues 14-20). Chimeric molecules, formed between the N-terminal region of RD1 and the soluble bacterial protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, were used in an in vitro system to determine the features within the splice region that were required for membrane association. The ability of RD1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase chimera to become membrane-associated was not affected by deletion of any of the following regions: the apolar section (residues 2-7) of the first helical region, the polar part of this region together with the hinge region (residues 8-13), or the polar end of the C-terminal helical region (residues 21-25).

Beavo J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 43: 923-959Crossref Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). The sole means of degrading this key second messenger within cells is through hydrolysis to 5′-AMP, which is achieved by a family of cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDE) (2Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar, 3Manganiello V.C. Murata T. Taira M. Belfrage P. Degerman E. Arch. Biochem.

At least five distinct families encode enzymes that display this activity, each of which exhibits distinct regulatory properties (2Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol.

Indeed, PDEs appear to provide a point of “cross-talk” between the cAMP signaling system and most, if not all, other signaling systems, suggesting that these enzymes may play a key role in signal integration. There is also considerable evidence to suggest that the functioning of cAMP within various cells may be compartmentalized (5Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 6Scott J.D. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 50: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 7Klauck T.M. Scott J.D. Cell. Signalling. 1995; 7: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The molecular machinery that might allow for this includes the functional targeting of type-II cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) to specific cellular membranes through interaction with a family of membrane-associated protein kinase A binding proteins (5Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 6Scott J.D. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 50: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 7Klauck T.M. Scott J.D. Cell. Signalling. 1995; 7: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Coupled to this are the observations that degradation of cAMP can be compartmentalized, as specific PDEs are also membrane-associated (8Houslay M.D. Kilgour E. Beavo J.A.

The PDE4 cAMP-specific PDEs provide clear examples of both cytosolic and membrane-associated PDEs (11Bolger G. McPhee I. Houslay M.D. J. Biol.

These enzymes are differentially expressed in various tissues and are formed by 5′ alternative splicing to yield proteins with distinct N-terminal regions (11Bolger G. McPhee I. Houslay M.D. J. Biol.

The engineered expression of the common “core” PDE4A gene product produces a highly active cytosolic protein (9Shakur Y. Pryde J.G. Houslay M.D. Biochem.

These unique N-terminal regions not only define intracellular targeting, but they also profoundly reduce catalytic activity (Vmax) and alter thermostability (9Shakur Y. Pryde J.G.

That the N-terminal splice region of RD1 (18Davis R.L. Takayasu H. Eberwine M. Myres J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3604-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) encodes a structure able to target an essentially soluble core PDE to the membrane fraction (9Shakur Y. Pryde J.G.

J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that “in-frame” chimera formed from this region of RD1 and CAT confers exclusive membrane-association upon this normally cytosolic, bacterial protein. Here we employ deletion analysis of RD1-CAT chimera to identify which of the distinct structural domains, identified using 1H NMR analysis of a 25-residue peptide encompassing the N-terminal splice region of RD1, is responsible for determining membrane association. GeneAmp™ PCR Reagent kit was purchased from Perkin-Elmer. Restriction and modifying enzymes, TnT™ SP6 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Wizard™ PCR, and Miniprep and Maxiprep systems were from Promega. Qiaex PCR purification kit was from Hybaid Ltd. Taq DyeDeoyx™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing kits were from Applied Biosystems. [14C]Chloramphenicol (54 mCi/mmol), [35S]methionine (50 mCi/mmol), 14C-labeled protein molecular weight markers, and ECL Western blot detection reagents were from Amersham International plc. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality available (Sigma). Plasmid pSVL-RD1 containing RD1 has been described previously (9Shakur Y. Pryde J.G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSV.SPORT was from Life Technologies Inc. PCR and sequencing primers were designed with the Gene Jockey program (Biosoft) (21Sheffield V.C. Cox D.R. Lerman L.S. Myers R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar) and synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 381A. A peptide representing the N-terminal first 25 amino acids of RD1 (MPLVDFFCETCSKPWLVGWWDQFKR) was synthesized via automated Fmoc ((fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer. The peptide amide was synthesized on a Rink Amide MBHA resin (Nova Biochem; 01-64-0037). Amino acid residues were used with following side chain protection: D,E,T,S-t-butyl; C,Q-trityl; K-Boc; and R-Pmc. Cleavage of peptide from the resin, with simultaneous deprotection of side chains, was done with 10 ml of trifluoroacetic acid containing 0.5 ml of H20, 0.5 ml of thioanisole, and 0.25 ml of ethanedithiol. Crude peptide was precipitated in ice-cold diethyl ether, dried in a stream of N2, and lyophilized from 10% acetic acid. Purification was by semi-preparative reverse phase chromatography (Vydac C18 column, 25 × 1 cm) using a 0-70% acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 5 ml/min over 76 min. Peptide identity and purity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy and Edman sequencing. 1H NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker AMX500 spectrometer using standard phase sensitive two-dimensional pulse sequences. Two-dimensional experiments were acquired with 2048/2K data points in F2, using a sweep width of 5500 Hz, and with 448 rows in F1. For TOCSY and COSY experiments 16 transients were acquired, and for NOESY experiments 80 transients were acquired. TOCSY experiments used an MLEV-17 mixing pulse of 60-ms duration (10 kHz spin locking field). The NOESY experiments were collected with mixing times of 50, 100, and 200 ms. Very weak presaturation was applied to the water resonance both during the relaxation delay (1.5 s) and also during the mixing time of the NOESY experiments. TOCSY, NOESY, and COSY spectra for assignment were collected on 7 mM solutions of peptide in the presence of 6-8 mM dithiothreitol, at both pH 6.0 in 50% d3 TFE/50% H2O (v/v, 300 K) and at pH 3.9 50% d3 TFE/50% H2O (v/v, 304 K). The addition of dithiothreitol eliminated the possibility of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bridge formation. Sequential NOEs were identified along the whole of peptide backbone, enabling proton resonances to be assigned in a quite straightforward fashion. The unambiguous identity of certain NOE cross-peaks was confirmed taking advantage of pH- and temperature-dependent shifts between different spectra. In order to detect backbone hydrogen bonding in the peptide, the rates of movement of chemical shifts with changes in temperature were followed in TOCSY spectra at temperatures between 285 and 311 K at both pH 4.1 and 6.0 with essentially no difference seen between the two data sets. Temperature shift coefficients were determined from the slope of a linear plot of temperature against chemical shift. Inter-proton distances were estimated from NOESY experiments by integration to yield cross-peak volumes in the 200-ms NOESY spectrum (all cross-peaks were also seen at 100 ms of mixing time). Cross-peaks were grouped into five classes between strong and very weak (strong and medium NOEs were allocated the same distance constraint values in calculations). The peptide structure was determined using XPLOR 3.1 (22Brunger A.T. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. President and Fellows of Harvard University, Yale University Press, Cambridge, MA1992Google Scholar) using a protocol in which certain atoms of each residue were embedded using the distance geometry routine (atoms CA, HA, N, HN, C, CB*, CG*, dg_sub_embed protocol). The remaining atoms were placed by template fitting, and then the atomic co-ordinates were allowed to evolve under the applied NOE distance constraints during a series of high temperature simulated annealing steps (dgsa and refine protocols). From the 100 calculated co-ordinate sets started, half were discarded (wrong handedness in the distance geometry routine). The final structures were produced by minimizing the averaged co-ordinates produced over the last 4 ps of a 5-ps low temperature simulated annealing trajectory. 25 structures were then chosen with no violations of the applied NOE constraints greater than 0.4 Å for analysis. To aid analysis, a mean structure was calculated by simultaneously refining these 25 structures in a high temperature simulated annealing protocol and applying an additional constraint tending to minimize the RMS difference between the aligned co-ordinates (NCS restraints applied individually to the regions Met1-Cys11, Cys11-Pro14, and Pro14-Arg25). It was not found necessary to include constraints for hydrogen bonds in any calculation. The pattern of hydrogen bond donors, indicated by changes in the rate of change in chemical shift of the backbone amides with changes in pH, was consistent with the calculated structures. There were no significant differences between the NOEs observed at pH 3.9 and 6.0, indicating that the structures were very similar. NMR data collected in water alone were of poor quality because of limited solubility of the peptide (less than 0.5 mM at pH 4 and lower at pH 6). The data implied that the problem was nonpolar aggregation at residues Leu3, Phe6, and Phe7 in the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix. However, in the water/TFE mixture intermolecular interactions were eliminated (e.g., there was no change in line width or chemical shift as concentrations were decreased). Trifluoroethanol was chosen as a co-solvent with water in this study because of its ability to reduce hydrophobic interactions between peptides (23Lau S.Y.M. Taneja A.K. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13253-13261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because of the enhancement of secondary structure for small peptides in solution, see e.g., 24Dyson H.J. Merutka G.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5256-5261Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar. Various mutations were generated within the 25-amino acid N-terminal region of RD1 by a modification of the method of overlapping extension mutagenesis described by Ho et al. (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 44: 51-59Crossref Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Primer pairs used were: GSOL17, 5′-GGTCGACTCTAGAATGTGCGAGACCTGC-3′, and GSOL18, 5′-GCAGGTCTCGCACATTCTAGAGTCGACC-3′ to generate deletion ΔP2-F7 (inclusive); GSOL27, 5′-GACTTCTTCCCCTGGCTGG-3′, and GSOL28, 5′-CCAGCCAGGGGAAGAAGTC-3′ to generate deletion ΔC8-K13 (inclusive); GSOL36, 5′-CCTGCTCCAAGGACCAGTTCAAAAGG-3′, and GSOL37, 5′-CCTTTTGAACTGGTCCTTGGAGCAGG-3′ to generate deletion ΔP14-W20 (inclusive); GSOL38, 5′-GCTGGTGGATGCTGAACC-3′, and GSOL39, 5′-GGTTCAGCATCCACCAGC-3′ to generate deletion ΔD21-R25 (inclusive); and GSOL62, 5′-CCTGCTCCAAGGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGACCAGTTCAAAAGG-3′, and GSOL62, 5′-CCTTTTGAACTGGTCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCCTTGGAGCAGG-3′ were used to replace P14-W20 (inclusive) of pGS7 with a cassette of seven alanine residues through the generation of plasmid pGS22. Primers GSOL10 (5′-CCAGTCACGACGTTGTAA-3′) and GSOL15 (5′-GGCTCCTCGAGCTTCCAGTGTGT-3′) were used as the sense and antisense primers, respectively, for each mutation-generating PCR reaction. Using plasmid pGS4 (20Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as template DNA, the following reaction conditions were used: 1 µg of template DNA, 25 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase 1 in a final volume of 50 µl with a mineral oil overlay. The reaction was subjected to the following conditions in a Techne PHC-3 thermocycler: denaturation for 1′ at 94°C, annealing for 2′ at 37°C, and extension for 3′ at 72°C for one cycle followed by denaturation for 1′ at 94°C, annealing for 2′ at 50°C, and extension for 3′ at 72°C for 30 cycles. Upon completion of the primary PCR reactions, samples were extracted once with an equal volume of chloroform to remove mineral oil before electrophoresis through a 1.75% low gelling temperature agarose gel. Fragments were identified by ultraviolet transilluminator and excised, and a small fraction (∼ 5 µl of each band) was mixed together and subjected to the same reaction conditions as was done previously but in the absence of the complementary mutagenic primers. When a second round of PCR was carried out under to the same conditions as done initially, but in the presence only of primers GSOL10 and GSOL15, a hybrid PCR product was generated containing the mutation of interest. Annealing of the two primary PCR products was facilitated by the complementary nature of the 3′ ends of the fragments generated during the primary reaction. Upon completion the reactions were extracted with an equal volume of chloroform as before and digested with restriction enzymes XbaI (12 units) and XhoI (8 units) in 6 mM Tris-HCl (final pH 7.9), 150 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol for 2 h. at 37°C. Digested fragments were recovered from 1.75% low gelling temperature agarose gels as before and substitute for the wild type RD1 N-terminal fragment of pGS7 (20Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem.

J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here we used a chimera formed between the N-terminal first 100 amino acids of RD1 fused, in frame, to the N terminus of CAT (20Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This has been shown (20Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to become associated with membranes in exactly the same way as the 1-25RD1-CAT chimera. The choice of the larger species was made because it facilitated performing the molecular engineering analyses, which otherwise would have been extremely difficult to do on the nucleotides encoding 1-25RD1 due to the small size of the fragment. The TnT™-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) was used to generate mature proteins from plasmid DNA. Post-translation duplicate aliquots were taken, and either TEN buffer or TEN buffer containing COS cell membranes was added. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then centrifuged to yield a soluble fraction and a membrane pellet, which was subsequently washed (20Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All samples were adjusted to give equal volumes prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualization on a PhosphorImager. The N-terminal splice region of the cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase RD1 is formed by the N-terminal first 23 amino acids (17Bolger G. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Here we provide a 1H NMR structural analysis of a synthetic peptide, which represents the N-terminal first 25 amino acids of RD1 and thus encompasses all of this region. The ability of distinct domains formed within this region to confer membrane association was then studied using deletion analysis performed on chimeric species formed from the N-terminal first 100 amino acids of RD1 linked to the soluble reporter protein CAT (20Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Sections from the NOESY spectrum used in the structure determination are shown in Fig. 1. A total of 406 NOEs were identified, 221 of these were inter-residue NOEs with 87 separated by more than one residue and 57 separated by more than two residues. A summary of these NOEs, which were used as distance restraints in the structure calculation, is shown in Fig. 2. A significant population of α-helix in the peptide structure was indicated by the NMR study, and this was confirmed by CD spectroscopy. In 50% d3TFE/50% H2O (v/v), 27%α-helix was detected at pH 3.9, and 33%α-helix was detected at pH 7.0. In water alone, only 4 and 6%α-helix was found at pH 3.9 and 7.0, respectively (data not shown).Fig. 2Summary of the NOEs observed for peptide 1-25 RD1. An illustration of the sequential and medium range NOE connectivities for peptide 1-25 RD1 in 50% TFE/50% H2O (v/v) is presented (composite of those observed at pH 3.9 and 6.0). The thickness of the bars reflects the intensities of the NOEs. The NOEs marked with asterisks could not be observed because of overlap of chemical shifts. The NOEs (i, i+2), (i,i+3), and (i,i+4) are those not part of the other illustrated classes, for example, the connectivity (i,i+2) indicates a class other than dαN(i,i+2), dNN(i,i+2), or dβN(i,i+2). For proline the δCH2 protons substitute for the NH protons.

As expected, the first two residues in the peptide form a “frayed” end with little conformational preference. The helical conformation of the peptide backbone is indicated by the large dNN(i,i+1) NOEs for all residues (present after 50 ms of mixing time and so not a result of spin diffusion) and by medium-range connectivities of the type dαN(i,i+3) for residues Leu3-Phe6, Val4-Phe7, Asp5-Cys8, Phe6-Glu9, and Cys8-Cys11 (27Dyson H.J.

Proteolysis at the Arg52-Ile53 peptide bond in the heavy chain of factor X leads to the formation of the serine protease, factor Xa, and the generation of a heavily glycosylated activation peptide comprising residues 1–52 of the heavy chain. The role of the activation peptide region in mediating substrate recognition and cleavage by the extrinsic Xase complex is unclear. The protease Agkistrodon rhodostoma hydrolase γ (ARHγ), from the venom of the Malayan pit viper, was used to selectively cleave human factor X in the activation peptide region. Three cleavage sites were found within this region and gave products designated Xdes1-34, Xdes1-43, and Xdes1-49. The products were purified to yield Xdes 1–49 and a mixture of Xdes 1–34 and Xdes 1–43. Reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography analysis indicated that the cleaved portion of the activation peptide was likely removed during purification. All cleaved species were inactive and could be completely activated to factor Xa by the extrinsic Xase complex or by a purified activator from Russell's viper venom. Steady state kinetic studies using tissue factor reconstituted into membranes yielded essentially equivalent kinetic constants for the activation of intact factor X and the cleaved derivatives under a wide range of conditions. Since Xdes 1–49 lacks all but three residues of the activation peptide and is devoid of the carbohydrate present in this region, the data suggest that the specific recognition of human factor X by the extrinsic Xase complex is not achieved through specific interactions with residues 1–49 of the activation peptide or with carbohydrate structures attached to these residues.

INTRODUCTIONHuman coagulation factor X is a serine protease zymogen, which circulates in blood as a two-chain molecule. It is composed of a 303-residue heavy chain, which is covalently linked by a disulfide bond to a 139-residue light chain. The light chain contains a γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing domain that is critical for the binding of calcium ions and phospholipid (3Jackson C.M. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1984; 7: 55-109PubMed Google Scholar). This subunit also contains two domains homologous to the epidermal growth factor precursor that are considered important for interdomain or protein-protein interactions (4Valcarce C. Holmgren A. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26011-26016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hertzberg M.S. Ben Tal O. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heavy chain contains the serine protease module, and glycosylation occurs exclusively in this chain (3Jackson C.M. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1984; 7: 55-109PubMed Google Scholar).The proteolytic activation of factor X via either the intrinsic or the extrinsic pathways is a requisite step of the blood coagulation cascade (7Nemerson Y. Blood. 1988; 71: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ruf W. Edgington T.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 9Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev.

The formation of the protease, factor Xa, results from specific cleavage of the Arg52-Ile53 peptide bond 2Since factor X circulates as a two-chain molecule, we prefer to use a residue numbering system that begins at the NH2 terminus of each polypeptide chain. As proteolysis is confined to the heavy chain of factor X, the sites of cleavage are designated relative to the NH2 terminus of the heavy chain. Therefore, the species Xdes 1–49 is equivalent to the derivative of porcine factor X designated Xdes 143–191 by Duffy and Lollar (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). in the heavy chain of the zymogen with the generation of a 52-residue glycosylated activation peptide (10Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The activation peptide of human factor X is heavily glycosylated with carbohydrate linked to Asn39 and Asn49 in human factor X (3Jackson C.M. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1984; 7: 55-109PubMed Google Scholar, 10Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The presence of additional O-linked carbohydrate sites at Thr17 and Thr29 has also been recently reported (11Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Further proteolysis at Arg237-Gly238 of the heavy chain is responsible for the removal of a 65-residue glycopeptide from the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain (12Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This reaction evidently results from autoproteolysis by Xa and converts the α-form of either factor X or Xa to the β form. No difference in function has yet been observed for these two forms of the zymogen or protease (13Pryzdial E.L.G. Kessler G.E. Blood. 1994; 84 (abstr.): 194Crossref Google Scholar).The high specificity of the cleavage reaction that leads to factor X activation by the VIIa-TF complex raises the possibility that the Arg52-Ile53 peptide bond in the substrate is specifically recognized as a result of extended site interactions between the substrate and the enzyme complex involving residues additional to the P1 3Nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (2Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4730) Google Scholar). arginine. An alternative possibility is that these types of extended interactions are limited but that the scissile bond in the substrate is highly accessible, leading to selective cleavage at this site. The first possibility is consistent with the developing structural information regarding other highly specific serine proteases of coagulation (14Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 23-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 15Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) as well as with the demonstration of residues in TF that are important for factor X binding and cleavage by the extrinsic Xase complex (16Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6375-6381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22206-22210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second possibility is consistent with the ability of several different proteases to specifically catalyze the same cleavage reaction, including the intrinsic Xase complex of coagulation (18Fujikawa K. Coan M.H. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5290-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the factor X-activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom (RVVX-CP) (10Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and trypsin (18Fujikawa K. Coan M.H. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5290-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The VIIa-TF complex also catalyzes the activation of factor IX to IXa with kinetic constants comparable with the activation of factor X (19Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9418-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Zur M. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5703-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are differences between the sequences beyond P1-P3 surrounding the two scissile bonds in factor IX and the bond cleaved in factor X (10Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Di Scipio R.G. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The data therefore imply that macromolecular substrate specificity of the extrinsic Xase complex is not completely explained by the recognition of extended sequences surrounding the scissile bond by the VIIa-TF complex.Recent studies have suggested an important role for carbohydrate structures present in the activation peptide in the recognition and cleavage of factor X by the extrinsic Xase complex (11Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Sinha U. Wolf D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sinha and Wolf (22Sinha U. Wolf D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), observed large effects on the rate and extent of human factor X activation by both the extrinsic and intrinsic Xase complexes following enzymatic removal of the sialic acids. Removal of both sialic acids and O-linked carbohydrates in bovine factor X led to a 5-fold decrease in the catalytic efficiency for activation by the VIIa-TF complex, which could be partially restored by subsequent removal of N-linked sugars (11Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, more recent studies have shown that removal of sialic acids has no detectable effect on factor X activation (23Bharadwaj D. Harris R.J. Kisiel W. Smith K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6537-6542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Evidence for a functional role for the activation peptide domain of factor X has also been developed in studies of Xa formation by the intrinsic Xase complex (IXa-VIIIa-membranes) (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Iino M. Takeya H. Nishioka J. Nakagaki T. Tamura K. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Duffy and Lollar (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prepared a proteolytic derivative of factor X by the action of a protease (ARHγ) isolated from the venom of the Malayan pit viper, Agkistrodon rhodostoma (25Lollar P. Parker C.G. Kajenski P.J. Litwiller R.D. Fass D.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7627-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This protease cleaves porcine factor X in the activation peptide region three residues NH2-terminal to the activation site, yielding a zymogen that can be completely activated to factor Xa upon subsequent cleavage by RVVX-CP or the intrinsic Xase complex (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial velocity studies by Duffy and Lollar (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that prior cleavage at this site in the activation peptide reduced the rate of activation of porcine factor X by the VIIIa-IXa complex. The reduced catalytic efficiency observed with the porcine factor X derivative lacking most of the activation peptide could be attributed to a decreased kcat compared with native factor X observed in the presence of the cofactor, factor VIIIa. More recent studies have also indicated an important role for the activation peptide in substrate recognition by the human VIIIa-IXa complex (24Iino M. Takeya H. Nishioka J. Nakagaki T. Tamura K. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Product inhibition studies of the VIIIa-IXa complex by factor Xa in the presence and absence of the isolated activation peptide have indicated that the activation peptide may mediate interactions between factor X and factor IXa in a carbohydrate-dependent manner within the intrinsic Xase complex (24Iino M. Takeya H. Nishioka J. Nakagaki T. Tamura K. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).In this study, proteolytic derivatives of human factor X were prepared by cleavage with ARHγ. These derivatives contain an intact activation site but lack various portions of the activation peptide NH2-terminal to this site (Scheme 1). These species were zymogens that could be fully activated to factor Xa by either RVVX-CP or the extrinsic Xase complex. One of these truncated derivatives contained no carbohydrate attachment site, whereas the other two contained one and two sites of N-linked carbohydrate, respectively. Kinetic studies with these purified substrate analogs were used to assess the contributions of the polypeptide sequences and carbohydrate structures in the activation peptide domain to factor X activation by the extrinsic Xase complex.DISCUSSIONThe venom protease from Malayan pit viper, ARHγ, was found to cleave human factor X at multiple sites to yield derivatives of the zymogen that were differentially truncated in the activation peptide domain. These proteolytic derivatives could be completely activated to factor Xa by the action of either RVVX-CP or the VIIa-TF extrinsic Xase complex. Three cleaved species, Xdes 1–34, Xdes 1–43, and Xdes 1–49 (Scheme 1), identified by NH2-terminal sequence analysis, were further purified and used in kinetic studies to assess the possible role of structures present in the activation peptide toward the recognition and cleavage of factor X by the extrinsic Xase complex.Steady state kinetic studies comparing the activation of human factor X with the proteolytic derivatives by RVVX-CP or by the extrinsic Xase complex yielded equivalent kinetic constants (Table II). Since minor effects on Km and kcat were observed following cleavage of the activation peptide at residues 34, 43, or 49, the data suggest that the amino acid side chains or carbohydrate structures present in this region do not significantly contribute to the binding of factor X to the extrinsic Xase complex or to the rate-limiting step in catalysis that yields factor Xa. These observations imply a limited role for the NH2-terminal 49 residues in determining the cleavage of factor X by the extrinsic Xase complex.The highly specific cleavage of factor X by the extrinsic Xase complex implies that the recognition of the scissile bond may be achieved by structures in the substrate that lead to binding interactions at extended sites in factor VIIa or possibly through additional interactions with TF. Mutagenesis experiments with TF have been able to resolve residues that affect the ability of the extrinsic Xase complex to cleave protein substrates such as factor X without affecting the ability of TF to interact with factor VIIa or enhancing its activity toward peptidyl substrates (16Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6375-6381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22206-22210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One interpretation of these findings is that TF contains sites for substrate binding. Studies examining the ability of synthetic peptides derived from the heavy chain of factor X to inhibit factor X activation by the VIIa-TF complex have provided evidence for sites on the substrate that are removed from the scissile bond but contribute to substrate recognition by the extrinsic Xase complex (47Chattopadhyay A. Fair D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recent work has also implicated oligosaccharide structures present at the four potential glycosylation sites in the activation peptide domain of factor X (Scheme 1) as being important for factor X activation by the extrinsic Xase complex (11Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Sinha U. Wolf D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The present kinetic results argue against a significant contribution of the first 49 residues of the activation peptide toward factor X recognition by the extrinsic Xase complex. Thus, specific cleavage at Arg52-Ile53 in the heavy chain, which results in the conversion of factor X to factor Xa by the extrinsic Xase complex, does not apparently result from substrate-protease or substrate-cofactor interactions that involve heavy chain residues that are NH2-terminal to the P3 position. Therefore, the substrate specificity of this enzyme complex may be dictated entirely by the P1-P3 residues and/or residues COOH-terminal to the scissile bond in the heavy chain of the molecule or possibly even by structural elements in the light chain of factor X. Studies with synthetic peptidyl substrates have previously implied a role for P′ residues for efficient cleavage by the VIIa-TF complex (48Butenas S. Ribarik N. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6531-6538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The venom protease ARHγ has previously been shown to cleave porcine factor X and yield a product equivalent to the Xdes 1–49 derivative identified in the present work (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of the activation of this derivative with intact factor X by the porcine intrinsic Xase complex (IXa-VIIIa-PCPS-Ca2+) yielded the same Km but a 100-fold lower kcat, suggesting a significant contribution of the activation peptide region to substrate hydrolysis, possibly through interactions with the protease and/or the cofactor (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, experimentally indistinguishable kinetic constants were obtained for the cleavage of human factor X or Xdes 1–49 by the extrinsic Xase complex. Since the activation of factor X by the extrinsic and the intrinsic Xase complexes results from the cleavage of the same peptide bond, one explanation for the results is that the determinants for the recognition and cleavage of the same substrate by the two enzyme complexes are different. Other explanations for these data include the possibility that cleavage(s) in the activation peptide region has a deleterious effect on substrate structure at distant sites that is significant in the case of porcine factor X but kinetically undetectable with human factor X. This possibility is supported by the significant decrease in kcat and in Km for activation by RVVX-CP following cleavage of porcine factor X by ARHγ. In contrast, the kinetic constants for human factor X activation by the same enzyme were essentially unaltered following cleavage by ARHγ. This interpretation would suggest that the kinetic consequences of cleavage or removal of the first 49 residues of the activation peptide region are actually related to the indirect effects of this region on structures about the scissile bond or on other domains of factor X rather than the deletion of sites directly involved in binding the protease and/or cofactor in the cognate enzyme complex.At least two other studies have provided indirect evidence suggesting the importance of the carbohydrates present in the activation peptide domain to factor X activation by the extrinsic Xase complex (11Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Sinha U. Wolf D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, contradictory information regarding the importance of O-linked versus N-linked carbohydrate for factor X activation by the extrinsic Xase complex has been developed following partial deglycosylation of factor X by glycosidases or by the use of specific lectins to inhibit factor X activation (11Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Sinha U. Wolf D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, evidence has been presented to show that removal of sialic acids has no effect on factor X cleavage by the extrinsic Xase complex (23Bharadwaj D. Harris R.J. Kisiel W. Smith K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6537-6542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).The proteolytic derivatives of human factor X prepared in the present work (Scheme 1) have provided reagents to assess this possibility more directly. Since the kinetic constants for the activation of these derivatives by the extrinsic Xase complex were equivalent to those obtained for intact factor X, our data are not consistent with these previous suggestions of a specific role for carbohydrates linked to the activation peptide in substrate recognition by this enzyme complex (22Sinha U. Wolf D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion is also supported by the observations of heterogeneity in carbohydrate structures present in the zymogen as detected by lectin binding. Although it is possible that this heterogeneity arises from subtle differences in sugars distinct from those involved in substrate recognition, it is difficult to envision how heterogeneity in specific macromolecular recognition elements could yield a substrate preparation that could be adequately characterized by a single set of kinetic constants by initial velocity measurements as well as by analysis of complete progress curves.Reversible, high affinity interactions have been documented between the fragment 1.2 activation peptide domain of prothrombin and prethrombin 2 (49Myrmel K.H. Lundblad R.L. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1767-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This interaction is apparently essential for efficient cleavage of prethrombin 2 by prothrombinase as a result of the ability of the fragment 2 domain to bind the cofactor (50Luckow E.A. Lyons D.A. Ridgeway T.M. Esmon C.T. Laue T.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2348-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 51Esmon C.T. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7791-7797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, reversible interactions between the activation peptide and factor Xa of high affinity have also been documented following the cleavage of bovine factor X (46Furie B.C. Furie B. Gottlieb A.J. Williams W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 365: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The lack of demonstrable kinetic differences between factor X and the derivatives obtained following cleavage by ARHγ could result from specific binding interactions via the activation peptide domain that are retained through noncovalent interactions between the cleavage products. The HPLC analyses indicate that the complete activation peptide is not present following affinity purification of factor Xa in the presence of EDTA. This is consistent with previous sedimentation velocity studies and the apparent ability of EDTA to disrupt this putative interaction (24Iino M. Takeya H. Nishioka J. Nakagaki T. Tamura K. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 52Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8969-8977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not possible to unequivocally rule out the association between trace amounts of peptidyl fragments and the ARHγ-cleaved derivatives of human factor X. The data are, however, consistent with the reasonable conclusion that the fragments of the activation peptide are likely removed during purification of Xdes 1–49 and are thus unlikely to mediate interactions between the extrinsic Xase complex and the scissile bond in Xdes1-49.In summary, the present data suggest that the activation of human factor X by the extrinsic Xase complex is not significantly influenced by the polypeptide sequence or carbohydrates present in the first 49 residues of the activation peptide domain. Thus, residues NH2-terminal to the P3 position do not play a dominant role in the recognition of factor X by the extrinsic Xase complex. It remains to be established whether the macromolecular substrate specificity of the extrinsic Xase is completely determined by the P1-P3 residues or requires additional interactions with P′ residues in the substrate. INTRODUCTIONHuman coagulation factor X is a serine protease zymogen, which circulates in blood as a two-chain molecule. It is composed of a 303-residue heavy chain, which is covalently linked by a disulfide bond to a 139-residue light chain. The light chain contains a γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing domain that is critical for the binding of calcium ions and phospholipid (3Jackson C.M. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1984; 7: 55-109PubMed Google Scholar). This subunit also contains two domains homologous to the epidermal growth factor precursor that are considered important for interdomain or protein-protein interactions (4Valcarce C. Holmgren A. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26011-26016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hertzberg M.S. Ben Tal O. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heavy chain contains the serine protease module, and glycosylation occurs exclusively in this chain (3Jackson C.M. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1984; 7: 55-109PubMed Google Scholar).The proteolytic activation of factor X via either the intrinsic or the extrinsic pathways is a requisite step of the blood coagulation cascade (7Nemerson Y. Blood. 1988; 71: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ruf W. Edgington T.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 9Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar).

The formation of the protease, factor Xa, results from specific cleavage of the Arg52-Ile53 peptide bond 2Since factor X circulates as a two-chain molecule, we prefer to use a residue numbering system that begins at the NH2 terminus of each polypeptide chain. As proteolysis is confined to the heavy chain of factor X, the sites of cleavage are designated relative to the NH2 terminus of the heavy chain. Therefore, the species Xdes 1–49 is equivalent to the derivative of porcine factor X designated Xdes 143–191 by Duffy and Lollar (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). in the heavy chain of the zymogen with the generation of a 52-residue glycosylated activation peptide (10Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The activation peptide of human factor X is heavily glycosylated with carbohydrate linked to Asn39 and Asn49 in human factor X (3Jackson C.M. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1984; 7: 55-109PubMed Google Scholar, 10Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The presence of additional O-linked carbohydrate sites at Thr17 and Thr29 has also been recently reported (11Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Further proteolysis at Arg237-Gly238 of the heavy chain is responsible for the removal of a 65-residue glycopeptide from the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain (12Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This reaction evidently results from autoproteolysis by Xa and converts the α-form of either factor X or Xa to the β form. No difference in function has yet been observed for these two forms of the zymogen or protease (13Pryzdial E.L.G. Kessler G.E. Blood. 1994; 84 (abstr.): 194Crossref Google Scholar).The high specificity of the cleavage reaction that leads to factor X activation by the VIIa-TF complex raises the possibility that the Arg52-Ile53 peptide bond in the substrate is specifically recognized as a result of extended site interactions between the substrate and the enzyme complex involving residues additional to the P1 3Nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (2Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4730) Google Scholar). arginine. An alternative possibility is that these types of extended interactions are limited but that the scissile bond in the substrate is highly accessible, leading to selective cleavage at this site. The first possibility is consistent with the developing structural information regarding other highly specific serine proteases of coagulation (14Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 23-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 15Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) as well as with the demonstration of residues in TF that are important for factor X binding and cleavage by the extrinsic Xase complex (16Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6375-6381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22206-22210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second possibility is consistent with the ability of several different proteases to specifically catalyze the same cleavage reaction, including the intrinsic Xase complex of coagulation (18Fujikawa K. Coan M.H. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5290-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the factor X-activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom (RVVX-CP) (10Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and trypsin (18Fujikawa K. Coan M.H. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5290-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The VIIa-TF complex also catalyzes the activation of factor IX to IXa with kinetic constants comparable with the activation of factor X (19Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9418-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Zur M. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5703-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are differences between the sequences beyond P1-P3 surrounding the two scissile bonds in factor IX and the bond cleaved in factor X (10Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Di Scipio R.G. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The data therefore imply that macromolecular substrate specificity of the extrinsic Xase complex is not completely explained by the recognition of extended sequences surrounding the scissile bond by the VIIa-TF complex.Recent studies have suggested an important role for carbohydrate structures present in the activation peptide in the recognition and cleavage of factor X by the extrinsic Xase complex (11Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Sinha U. Wolf D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sinha and Wolf (22Sinha U. Wolf D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), observed large effects on the rate and extent of human factor X activation by both the extrinsic and intrinsic Xase complexes following enzymatic removal of the sialic acids. Removal of both sialic acids and O-linked carbohydrates in bovine factor X led to a 5-fold decrease in the catalytic efficiency for activation by the VIIa-TF complex, which could be partially restored by subsequent removal of N-linked sugars (11Inoue K. Morita T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, more recent studies have shown that removal of sialic acids has no detectable effect on factor X activation (23Bharadwaj D. Harris R.J. Kisiel W. Smith K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6537-6542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Evidence for a functional role for the activation peptide domain of factor X has also been developed in studies of Xa formation by the intrinsic Xase complex (IXa-VIIIa-membranes) (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Iino M. Takeya H. Nishioka J. Nakagaki T. Tamura K. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Duffy and Lollar (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prepared a proteolytic derivative of factor X by the action of a protease (ARHγ) isolated from the venom of the Malayan pit viper, Agkistrodon rhodostoma (25Lollar P. Parker C.G. Kajenski P.J. Litwiller R.D. Fass D.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7627-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This protease cleaves porcine factor X in the activation peptide region three residues NH2-terminal to the activation site, yielding a zymogen that can be completely activated to factor Xa upon subsequent cleavage by RVVX-CP or the intrinsic Xase complex (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial velocity studies by Duffy and Lollar (1Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that prior cleavage at this site in the activation peptide reduced the rate of activation of porcine factor X by the VIIIa-IXa complex. The reduced catalytic efficiency observed with the porcine factor X derivative lacking most of the activation peptide could be attributed to a decreased kcat compared with native factor X observed in the presence of the cofactor, factor VIIIa. More recent studies have also indicated an important role for the activation peptide in substrate recognition by the human VIIIa-IXa complex (24Iino M. Takeya H. Nishioka J. Nakagaki T. Tamura K. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Product inhibition studies of the VIIIa-IXa complex by factor Xa in the presence and absence of the isolated activation peptide have indicated that the activation peptide may mediate interactions between factor X and factor IXa in a carbohydrate-dependent manner within the intrinsic Xase complex (24Iino M. Takeya H. Nishioka J. Nakagaki T. Tamura K. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).In this study, proteolytic derivatives of human factor X were prepared by cleavage with ARHγ. These derivatives contain an intact activation site but lack various portions of the activation peptide NH2-terminal to this site (Scheme 1). These species were zymogens that could be fully activated to factor Xa by either RVVX-CP or the extrinsic Xase complex. One of these truncated derivatives contained no carbohydrate attachment site, whereas the other two contained one and two sites of N-linked carbohydrate, respectively. Kinetic studies with these purified substrate analogs were used to assess the contributions of the polypeptide sequences and carbohydrate structures in the activation peptide domain to factor X activation by the extrinsic Xase complex."

The predicted products following nitrous acid deamination and digestion with phospholipases A2, C, and D confirmed their GPI nature. Evidence that they may represent the anchor transferred to the 1G7 antigen came from the following analyses: (i) α-mannosidase treatments indicated that only one mannose was amenable to removal; (ii) their lipid moiety was identified as sn-1-alkyl-2-acylglycerol due to their sensitivity to phospholipase A2 (PLA2), mild base and by direct high performance TLC analysis of the corresponding benzoylated diradylglycerol components; and (iii) both glycolipids incorporated 3H-fatty acid only in the sn-2- and not in the sn-1-alkyl position as previously found in the GPI of the mature 1G7 antigen.

In the in vitro cell-free system both glycolipids were synthesized simultaneously and do not seem to bear a precursor/product relationship. Among the various components synthesized in vitro a glycolipid C-like corresponding to a form of glycolipid A-like 1 acylated on the inositol was also characterized.

Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 71-80Google Scholar). The anti-mitogenic effects of TGF-β in particular have attracted much attention. By inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases, TGF-β can override the action of mitogens without directly blocking their signal transduction pathways (5Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehouse L.L. Livingston D.M.

TGF-β initiates signaling at the membrane by contacting two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type I and II receptors (TβR-I and TβR-II) (9Lin H.Y. Wang X.F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Google Scholar, 10Franzén P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K.

Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Google Scholar). These receptors belong to a family that also includes receptors for other TGF-β-related factors such as activins and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) (4Attisano L. Wrana J.L. López-Casillas F. Massagué J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 71-80Google Scholar). Type II receptors bind ligand present in the medium, and this complex associates with and phosphorylates type I receptors (12Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cá;rcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is at serine and threonine residues clustered in the GS domain, a region just upstream of the kinase domain and conserved in all type I receptors, and mutation of these sites blocks TGF-β signaling (13Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Google Scholar). Certain mutations in the GS domain generate a constitutively active TβR-I that does not require the presence of ligand or TβR-II for signaling (14Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TβR-I, acting downstream of TβR-II, is directly involved in transducing TGF-β signals to downstream substrates.In order to search for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of TβR-I, we used protein interaction cDNA cloning in yeast. This led to the identification of farnesyl transferase-α (FT-α) as a TβR-I interacting protein. FT-α is a shared subunit of heteromeric transferases that attach farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moieties to a variety of proteins that play key roles in signal transduction, protein secretion, and cytoskeleton assembly (15Chen W.J. Andres D.A. Golstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11368-11372Google Scholar, 16Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Google Scholar). We provide evidence that the interaction between TβR-I and FT-α can also take place in mammalian cells. Similar observations were reported by two other groups (17Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29628-29631Google Scholar, 18Wang T. Danielson P.D. Li B. Shah P.C. Kim S.D. Donahoe P.K. Science. 1996; 271: 1120-1122Google Scholar) while this paper was in preparation. Additionally, we have analyzed the physiological relevance of this interaction.RESULTSWe generated bait constructs for a yeast two-hybrid system (19Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar) using cDNAs encoding the human TβR-I cytoplasmic domain, either wild type or containing the T204D mutation (Fig. 1A). This mutation elevates the kinase activity of TβR-I in vitro and endows this receptor with the ability to signal in the absence of TGF-β or TβR-II (14Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Google Scholar). Screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library with either bait yielded three major classes of cDNAs. Two of these encoded, respectively, the FK506/rapamycin binding protein FKBP12 and the BMP type II receptor BMPR-II, both of which have been previously described as TβR-I interacting proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system (20Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Google Scholar, 26Wang T. Donahue P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Google Scholar, 27Kawabata M. Chytil A. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5625-5630Google Scholar). The third class of cDNAs isolated in these screenings encodes FT-α. This class accounted for 25% of all clones isolated with TβR-I as bait, and 40% of those isolated with TβR-I(T204D) as bait (of over 100 clones analyzed in each case). The isolated FT-α clones encoded the full-length protein or lacked no more than 79 amino acids at the N terminus, suggesting that the interaction with TβR-I requires most of the FT-α protein.FT-α interacted weakly or not at all with the cytoplasmic domains of TβR-II (9Lin H.Y. Wang X.F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Google Scholar), the activin type I receptor ActR-I (11Attisano L. Cá;rcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Google Scholar), the mixed specificity type I receptor TSR-I (11Attisano L. Cá;rcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Google Scholar), or with empty vector (Fig. 1B). However, FT-α interacted strongly with the cytoplasmic domain of the activin type I receptor ActR-IB (Fig. 1B), which has high sequence similarity (90% identity) to that of TβR-I (22Cá;rcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Google Scholar). To analyze the structural requirements of TβR-I for its interaction with FT-α, we used baits containing mutations that are known to alter the kinase activity of TβR-I and its signaling ability in mammalian cells. The (K232R) bait, which contains a mutation that eliminates kinase activity in TβR-I (13Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Google Scholar), interacted very weakly with FT-α, whereas the (T204D) bait interacted with FT-α more strongly than the wild type bait (Fig. 1B). Curiously, mutations that eliminate TβR-II phosphorylation sites in the TβR-I GS domain and prevent signaling in mammalian cells (13Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Google Scholar, 14Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Google Scholar) increased the interaction of the TβR-I bait with FT-α (Fig. 1B). A similar result was obtained with a bait containing a full replacement of the GS domain with an unrelated juxtamembrane sequence of TβR-II (construct TβR-I (IIGS)) (Fig. 1B), indicating that the GS domain is not directly involved in the interaction.In order to investigate these interactions in mammalian cells, FT-α was tagged with the Flag epitope sequence at its N terminus and transfected into COS-1 cells alone or in combination with full-length TβR-I constructs. The latter were tagged at the C terminus with a hexahistidine sequence that binds to Ni2+-NTA-agarose. An interaction between the transfected TβR-I and FT-α was demonstrated by incubating the cell lysates with Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads followed by immunoblotting of the bound material using Flag antibody (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the results in yeast, the interaction with FT-α was not detectably affected by the mutations K232R or T204D in TβR-I. Cotransfection of TβR-II and addition of TGF-β were also without effect on the association between TβR-I and FT-α, as judged from the amount of coprecipitated FT-α (Fig. 2A). Metabolic labeling of these transfectants with [35S]methionine and [32P]phosphate followed by precipitation of total FT-α with anti-Flag antibody indicated that FT-α is a phosphoprotein in the absence of TGF-β or cotransfected receptors (Fig. 2B). No change in the ratio of 32P/35S labeling of FT-α was observed in cells cotransfected with the wild type, kinase-defective, or constitutively active TβR-I constructs or with both TβR-I and TβR-II in the presence of TGF-β (Fig. 2B). Similar experiments using an untagged FT-α construct and precipitation with a FT-α monoclonal antibody (28Andres D.A. Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1383-1390Google Scholar) also yielded no evidence of TGF-β-induced FT-α phosphorylation (data not shown).Fig. 2FT-α interaction with TβR-I and phosphorylation in mammalian cells. COS-1 cells were transfected with FT-α tagged with the Flag epitope and different TβR-I constructs tagged with a hexahistidine sequence. Assays were done 2 days after transfections. A, histidine-tagged TβR-I receptors were isolated from cell lysates using Ni2+-NTA-agarose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with anti-Flag antibody to detect FT-α (upper panel) or anti-TβR-I as a control (lower panel). B, cells transfected with the indicated constructs were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (lower panel) or [32P]phosphate (upper panel). FT-α was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and resolved on SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The question was raised as to whether TβR-I recognized FT-α as part of a holoenzyme with FT-β or GGT-β. In experiments designed to test this possibility, we observed that cotransfection of the β subunits inhibited the interaction of FT-α with TβR-I (Fig. 3). Transfection of FT-β or GGT-β generated holoenzyme complexes with cotransfected FT-α while it inhibited the association of FT-α with TβR-I. Controls showed that this effect was not due to a decreased expression of FT-α or TβR-I (Fig. 3), suggesting that TβR-I does not recognize the isoprenyl transferase holoenzymes.Fig. 3Effect of expression of isoprenyl transferase β subunits on the receptor-FT-α interaction. COS-1 cells were transfected with 0.5 µg of plasmids encoding Flag-tagged FT-α and hexahistidine-tagged TβR-I, respectively, and increasing amounts (0.025, 0.15, and 1 µg) of plasmids encoding FT-β or GGT-β or empty vector. After 2 days, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h. FT-α was precipitated with anti-Flag antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (upper panel). TβR-I was retrieved with Ni2+-NTA-agarose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted either with anti-Flag antibody to detect FT-α (middle panel) or TβR-I antibody (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to determine the functional consequence of the interaction between FT-α and TβR-I, we tested the effect of TGF-β on protein isoprenylation. Mv1Lu epithelial cells were used since they are highly responsive to TGF-β. Cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]mevalonolactone, a biosynthetic precursor of both farnesyl and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Incubation for 8 h with physiological concentrations of TGF-β did not modify the level of 3H incorporation into Triton-soluble proteins detectable under these conditions (Fig. 3A). A labeled protein of 20 kDa (presumably a small G protein; 23James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Rawson T.E. Somers T.C. McDowell R.S. Crowley C.W. Lucas B.K. Levinson A.D. Masters J.C. Science. 1993; 260: 1937-1942Google Scholar) migrated slightly faster after cell treatment with TGF-β (Fig. 4A). TβR-I has no consensus isoprenylation motif and did not become labeled in [3H]mevalonolactone-labeled cells (data not shown). Farnesyl transferase activity assayed in cell lysates with recombinant Ha-ras as a substrate was similar in control and TGF-β-treated cells (Fig. 4B). Therefore, TGF-β action does not significantly alter the overall protein isoprenyl transferase activity in the cell.Fig. 4TGF-β effects on protein isoprenylation activity. A, Mv1Lu cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]mevalonolactone and treated with different TGF-β concentrations for 8 h. Triton-soluble proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. B, extracts of cells treated with increasing TGF-β concentrations were assayed for farnesyl transferase activity using H-ras and [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate as substrates. Labeled Ha-ras was visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Finally, we determined the effect of farnesyl transferase inhibitor L-744-832 (25Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N.E. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309Google Scholar) on TGF-β responsiveness in Mv1Lu cells. This agent blocks farnesyl transferase activity at 20 µM or lower concentrations in diverse cell types (25Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N.E. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309Google Scholar) including Mv1Lu cells. 2L. Sepp-Lorenzini and N. Rosen, personal communication. Mv1Lu cell proliferation was inhibited half-maximally by ∼20 µM L-744-832 and maximally by 40 µM L-744-832 (Fig. 5A). Mv1Lu cells respond to TGF-β with increased transcription of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (22Cá;rcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Google Scholar). Using a luciferase reporter construct (p3TP-lux) that contains the TGF-β response region of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter (22Cá;rcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Google Scholar), the luciferase response to TGF-β was not affected by addition of 20 µM L-744-832 and was decreased by 40 µM L-744-832 but only at the lower (<10 pM) TGF-β concentration range (Fig. 5B). In experiments designed to determine the effect of L-744-832 on the growth inhibitory response to TGF-β, a partial inhibition of 125I-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA observed with 20 µM L-744-832 was simply additive to the inhibitory effect of TGF-β (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that farnesyl transferase activity is not essential for TGF-β signaling in Mv1Lu cells and has little or no participation in the two TGF-β responses analyzed here.Fig. 5Effect of farnesyl transferase inhibitor on TGF-β action. A, effect of various concentrations of farnesyl transferase inhibitor L-744-832 on Mv1Lu cell proliferation. B and C, Mv1Lu cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of TGF-β and L-744-832 for 15 h and assayed for luciferase activity from a transfected p3TP-lux reporter construct (22Cá;rcamo J.

Data are the average of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe have used a yeast two-hybrid cloning system to search for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of TβR-I since this is a downstream component of the TGF-β receptor system. Separate screenings of a HeLa cell cDNA library with either the wild type TβR-I cytoplasmic domain or a constitutively active mutant version yielded multiple isolates of three different classes of clones. One class corresponds to the BMP type II receptor BMPR-II previously shown to interact with TβR-I in yeast (20Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Google Scholar, 27Kawabata M. Chytil A. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5625-5630Google Scholar). Another class corresponds to the FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein FKBP-12 whose interaction with TβR-I has also been previously documented and remains of unknown significance (26Wang T. Donahue P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Google Scholar). The third class, as reported here, are clones encoding FT-α. While this report was in preparation, both Kawabata et al. (17Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29628-29631Google Scholar) and Wang et al. (18Wang T. Danielson P.D. Li B. Shah P.C. Kim S.D. Donahoe P.K. Science. 1996; 271: 1120-1122Google Scholar) using the same approach reported an interaction of TβR-I with FT-α and proposed that this interaction might regulate the activity of the enzyme and explain the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β. Here we provide evidence for this interaction in mammalian cells and address the question of its physiological significance.TβR-I has no consensus isoprenylation motif and was not isoprenylated in our assays. Therefore, it is unlikely that TβR-I is a substrate of FT-α. On the other hand, the kinase activity of certain TβR-I constructs correlates with their ability to interact with FT-α in yeast, and similar findings have been made by Kawabata et al. (17Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29628-29631Google Scholar). Recombinant TβR-I kinase is able to phosphorylate FT-α in vitro (17Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29628-29631Google Scholar). 3M. Kretzschmar and J. Massagué, unpublished work. However, some of our evidence challenges the notion that TβR-I association with FT-α simply reflects a kinase-substrate recognition event. Mutations that eliminate ligand-dependent phosphorylation sites in the GS domain actually increase the interaction of TβR-I with FT-α in yeast even though they decrease the kinase activity of TβR-I and block TβR-I signaling activity (14Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to their effect on the receptor-FTα interaction in yeast, the K232R and T204D mutations had no detectable effect on this interaction in COS-1 cells. We observed no change in the phosphorylation level of FT-α by cotransfection of receptors and TGF-β addition to the cells, although this result stands in contrast to those of Wang et al. (18Wang T. Danielson P.D. Li B. Shah P.C. Kim S.D. Donahoe P.K. Science. 1996; 271: 1120-1122Google Scholar) who reported ligand-induced phosphorylation of FT-α. Further investigation is required to determine the reason for this discrepancy and the basis for the interaction between TβR-I and FT-α.The overall level of protein isoprenylation in intact cells or the Ras farnesylation activity in cell extracts is not affected by TGF-β addition to Mv1Lu cells, a cell line that is strongly growth-inhibited by this factor. TGF-β could have altered isoprenyl transferase activity in a transient manner that escaped detection in our experiments. However, this seems unlikely since protein isoprenylation has a relatively long half-life in the cell and is not known to undergo a highly dynamic regulation (16Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Google Scholar). We also considered the possibility that farnesyl transferase activity might be required for TGF-β signaling. This question was investigated with the use of the farnesyl transferase inhibitor L-744-832. This agent inhibits cell proliferation by inhibiting protein farnesylation (25Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N.E. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309Google Scholar). Yet, at a concentration that blocks cell proliferation, L-744-832 has little effect on the basal or TGF-β-activated expression of a reported gene in these cells. On the other hand, the growth inhibitory effects of L-744-832 and TGF-β in Mv1Lu cells are additive with no evidence of synergy. These results suggest that farnesyl transferase activity does not participate in these TGF-β responses.Significantly, in addition to forming complexes with FT-α, the cotransfected FT-β or GGT-β subunits inhibit the interaction of FT-α with TβR-I. Thus, the receptor can recognize isolated FT-α but not the holoenzymes and, therefore, may not be associated with isoprenyl transferase activity. It is possible that the receptor acts as a negative regulator of isoprenyl transferases by sequestering FT-α. However, overexpression of TβR-I alone does not cause the alterations in proliferation and other cellular functions that might be expected from an efficient sequestration of endogenous FT-α. Alternatively, FT-α might have a high tendency to associate with β subunits and, in their absence, with other proteins that for unknown reasons include TβR-I. In any case, we find no evidence that TβR-I or FT-α affects the known functions of each other. The hypothesis that Ras activity and cell proliferation are regulated through a direct interaction of the TGF-β receptor with farnesyl transferase is not supported by the evidence to date.

Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 71-80Google Scholar). The anti-mitogenic effects of TGF-β in particular have attracted much attention. By inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases, TGF-β can override the action of mitogens without directly blocking their signal transduction pathways (5Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehouse L.L. Livingston D.M.

TGF-β initiates signaling at the membrane by contacting two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type I and II receptors (TβR-I and TβR-II) (9Lin H.Y. Wang X.F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Google Scholar, 10Franzén P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K.

Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Google Scholar). These receptors belong to a family that also includes receptors for other TGF-β-related factors such as activins and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) (4Attisano L. Wrana J.L. López-Casillas F. Massagué J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 71-80Google Scholar). Type II receptors bind ligand present in the medium, and this complex associates with and phosphorylates type I receptors (12Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cá;rcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is at serine and threonine residues clustered in the GS domain, a region just upstream of the kinase domain and conserved in all type I receptors, and mutation of these sites blocks TGF-β signaling (13Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Google Scholar). Certain mutations in the GS domain generate a constitutively active TβR-I that does not require the presence of ligand or TβR-II for signaling (14Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TβR-I, acting downstream of TβR-II, is directly involved in transducing TGF-β signals to downstream substrates.In order to search for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of TβR-I, we used protein interaction cDNA cloning in yeast. This led to the identification of farnesyl transferase-α (FT-α) as a TβR-I interacting protein. FT-α is a shared subunit of heteromeric transferases that attach farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moieties to a variety of proteins that play key roles in signal transduction, protein secretion, and cytoskeleton assembly (15Chen W.J. Andres D.A. Golstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11368-11372Google Scholar, 16Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Google Scholar). We provide evidence that the interaction between TβR-I and FT-α can also take place in mammalian cells. Similar observations were reported by two other groups (17Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29628-29631Google Scholar, 18Wang T. Danielson P.D. Li B. Shah P.C. Kim S.D. Donahoe P.K.

Sequence analysis reveals that the predicted amino acid sequence of the molecule is composed of an N-terminal unique region, an internal acidic region, and C-terminal repeat region. Analysis of the cDNA clones and genomic Southern analysis indicated that Nopp44/46 belongs to a multigene family in which different gene copies are very similar but vary in the number of repeats. Interestingly, the repetitive amino acid sequence motif contains multiple RGG (Arg-Gly-Gly) boxes characteristic of RNA-binding proteins. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that Nopp44/46 is indeed capable of binding nucleic acids. Competition experiments with different RNA homopolymers demonstrated that Nopp44/46 preferentially binds to poly(U). These studies suggest that Nopp44/46 may play a role in RNA metabolism in trypanosomes and raise the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation may regulate the process.

The flavin reductase Fre is the prototype of a new class of flavin reductases able to transfer electrons with no prosthetic group. It has been suggested that the flavin reductase could belong to the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) family, on the basis of limited sequence homologies. A sequence, conserved within the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family and present in the flavin reductase, is important for recognition of the isoalloxazine ring. Within this sequence, we have mutated serine 49 of the flavin reductase into alanine or threonine. kcat value of the S49A mutant was 35-fold lower than kcat of the wild-type enzyme. Determination of real Kd values for NADPH and lumichrome, a flavin analog, showed that recognition of the flavin is strongly affected by the S49A mutation, whereas affinity for the nicotinamide cofactor is only weakly modified. This suggests that serine 49 is involved in the binding of the isoalloxazine ring. Moreover, the Kd value for 5-deazariboflavin, in which the N-5 position of the isoalloxazine ring has been changed to a carbon atom, is not affected by the serine 49 to alanine mutation. This is consistent with the concept that the N-5 position is the main site for serine 49-flavin interaction. In the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family, the equivalent serine residue, which has been shown to be essential for activity, is hydrogen-bonded to the N-5 of the FAD cofactor.

https://openalex.org/W2030056398,"The rat Calbindin-D9K (CaBP9K) gene is mainly expressed in intestine, uterus, and lung and is regulated in a complex tissue-specific manner. To analyze the role of potential regulatory elements, previously defined by DNaseI hypersensivity, we made transgenic mice containing truncated rat CaBP9K fusion gene with simian virus 40 large T antigen and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as reporter genes. The transgenes contained CaBP9K promoter fragments with 5′ end points at −4400, −1011, and −117 base pairs (bp), whereas the 3′ end points was at +365 bp. Northern blot analysis of T antigen expression and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that a positive element, probably the distal intestine-specific DNaseI HS, necessary to target the expression of the transgene in the intestine, is present between −4400 and −1011 bp. The cephalo-caudal gradient of expression of the transgene along the small intestine was similar to those of the endogenous gene, but an ectopic expression of the transgene was observed in the colon. The −1011 transgene was expressed in epithelial alveolar cells of the lung, in renal proximal tubule cells, and in uterine myometrium, as judged from immunocytochemical, histological, and Northern blot analyses. The shortest, −117 construct was only expressed in uterine myometrium, and it was under a strict estrogen dependence like the endogenous gene. Finally, responsiveness to vitamin D in the duodenum was observed with the largest, −4400 construct.

Thus, different tissues utilize distinct cis-acting elements to direct and regulate the expression of the rat CaBP9K gene. The expression of eukaryotic genes depends on the specific arrangement of unique DNA enhancer and promoter elements and DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. The binding of transcriptional factors to DNA regulatory elements is an essential step in the activation or repression of a gene in a temporal or cell-specific pattern and in response to extracellular signals. The calbindin-D9K (CaBP9K) gene is a particularly valuable model for studying the hormonal, tissue-specific, and developmental control of genes expressed in several tissues. CaBP9K is an intracellular calcium-binding protein thought to be involved in intracellular calcium homeostasis (see 1Christakos S. Gabrielides C. Rhoten W.B. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 10: 3-25Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar for a review). In adult rats, the CaBP9K gene is mainly expressed in intestine, uterus, and lung. The highest concentration of CaBP9K is in intestinal epithelial cells (2Warembourg M. Tranchant O. Perret C. Desplan C. Thomasset M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), with a concentration gradient along the gastrointestinal tract; the CaBP9K gene is actively expressed in the duodenum, but expression gradually decreases along the jejunum to the ileum, with no expression in the large intestine, except for the cecum (3Thomasset M. Parkes C.O. Cuisinier-Gleizes P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 6: E483-E488Google Scholar, 4Perret C. Desplan C. Thomasset M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the villus itself, the concentration of CaBP9K increases from the crypt to the upper part of the villi. Intestinal CaBP9K gene activity that is controlled by calcitriol, the active hormonal form of vitamin D (3Thomasset M. Parkes C.O. Cuisinier-Gleizes P. Am. J.

It is maximal at weaning and decreases with age (3Thomasset M. Parkes C.O. Cuisinier-Gleizes P. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 6: E483-E488Google Scholar, 6Armbrecht H.J. Boltz M. Strong R. Richardson A. Bruns M.E.H. Christakos S. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2950-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the uterus, the CaBP9K gene is expressed mainly in the myometrium and the endometrial stroma of nonpregnant rats (7Delorme A.C. Danan J.L. Acker M.G. Ripoche M.A. Mathieu H. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Bruns M.E. Kleeman E. Millis S.E. Bruns B.E. Herr J.C. Anat.

Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 247: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast with the intestine, the CaBP9K gene is not under the control of vitamin D in the uterus, although there are vitamin D receptors in this tissue; instead it is under the control of the sex hormones (7Delorme A.C.

Finally, CaBP9K gene expression is regulated by neither vitamin D nor estradiol in the alveolar epithelial cells of the lung (14Dupret J.M. L'Horset F. Perret C. Bernaudin J.F. Thomasset M. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2643-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Lastly, the CaBP9K gene is expressed in the mouse kidney but not in the rat kidney (15Schreiner D.S. Jande S.S.

Our previous studies focused on the cis- and trans-acting phenomena controlling the expression of the rat CaBP9K gene. We have cloned and characterized the rat CaBP9K gene and its 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences (17Perret C. Lomri N. Gouhier N. Auffray C. Thomasset M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and mapped the DNase I-hypersensitive sites in several rat tissues to locate potential regulatory elements (18Perret C. L'Horset F. Thomasset M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A cluster of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS2 to HS5) was found in the promoter proximal region of the active gene (in the intestine and uterus). Two intestinal-specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites were also identified, HS4 close to the promoter region and HS1 located −3.5 kbp upstream of the start site (18Perret C. L'Horset F. Thomasset M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). An in vitro DNase I footprinting assay was used to show that a combination of intestinal-specific transcription factor (Cdx-2), liver-specific transcription factors (HNF-1, C/EBP, and HNF4), and ubiquitous factors bind to the proximal promoter region and may be important for the control of the rat CaBP9K gene transcription in the intestine (19Lambert M. Colnot S. Suh E. L'Horset F. Blin C. Raymondjean M. Thomasset M. Traber P.G. Perret C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To get further insight in the understanding of the cis-regulatory regions involved in the multiple control of the rat CaBP9K gene in vivo, we choose to create lines of transgenic mice because ex vivo studies are hampered by the fact that no established cell line expressing the CaBP9K gene is available. We have also attempted to use targeted oncogenesis to isolate new cell lines, which may be suitable models for studying the molecular events implicated in the regulation of the CaBP9K gene. Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (Tag) gene was first selected as reporter gene, but some of these transgenic mice died immediately after birth. Consequently, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) was also used as a reporter gene. The main results from the present study show that distinct sequences are required for the expression of the rat CaBP9K gene in the intestine, uterus, and lung. Transgenes were constructed using standard recombinant technology (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratary Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 1.53Google Scholar). The 9K/−4400-Tag and 9K/−4400-CAT constructs were prepared as follows. A fragment (−22 to +365 bp) containing the promoter region (beginning at the SacI site), the first exon, the first intron, and the beginning of the second exon (before the ATG initiation codon) was cloned by PCR. The resulting SacI-EcoRV fragment was then cloned, together with a EcoRI-SacI fragment containing 5′ regulatory sequences of the rat CaBP9K gene (−2232 to −22 bp) in the Bluescript KS vector. A BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing upstream 5′ regulatory sequences (−4400 to −2232 bp) was then inserted to yield the 9K/−4400 construct, which contained 4.4 kbp of 5′ regulatory sequences, the promoter, the first exon, the first intron, and the beginning of the second exon of the rat CaBP9K gene. The 9K/−4400-Tag construct was prepared by inserting the klenow-blunted 2.4-kbp StuI-BamHI fragment of the SV40 early gene containing only the large T coding sequence (the small t sequence from −4636 to −4904 bp was deleted) into the 9K/−4400 construct at the EcoRV site. The 1.6-kbp (BglII-SmaI) fragment isolated from PBLCAT2 containing the coding region of CAT was similarly inserting to obtain 9K/−4400-CAT. 9K/−1011-Tag was prepared by cloning the SacI-EcoRV fragment obtained by PCR cloning together with a PstI-SacI fragment containing 5′ regulatory sequences of the rat CaBP9K gene (−1011 to −22 bp) in the Bluescript KS vector. The coding region for the SV40 large T antigen was then inserted in the same way as the 9K/−4400-Tag. The 9K/−117-Tag construct was prepared by cloning the SacI-EcoRV fragment obtained by PCR cloning and containing the CaBP9K promoter region with the HindIII-SacI fragment containing the 5′ regulatory sequences of the CaBP9K gene (−117 to −22 bp) in the Bluescript KS vector. The coding region for SV40 large T antigen was then inserted as for 9K/−4400-Tag. The transgenes were separated from plasmid vector sequences by restriction endonuclease digestion and isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. The restriction fragments containing the chimeric gene were microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs as described previously (21Cuif M.H. Cognet M. Boquet D. Tremp G. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Founders were identified after Southern blot analysis of tail DNAs from 2-week-old mice. They were hybridized with a probe for the SV40 large T antigen (fragment StuI-BamHI) to detect 9K/−4400-Tag, 9K/−1011-Tag, and 9K/−117-Tag detection or with a CAT probe (fragment BglII-SmaI from PBLCAT2) to detect 9K/−4400-CAT. Lines were established by outbreeding founder F0 mice to obtain heterozygous mice. All subsequent studies were performed on F1 or F2 mice, except for 9K/−4400-Tag transgenic mice. Tissues were homogenized in 0.4 ml of 250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA using a Potter tissue homogenizer and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated at 65°C for 10 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and 4°C for 15 min. Protein content was measured by the Bradford procedure (22Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (209748) Google Scholar). The amount of CAT protein in tissue extracts was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (Boehringer Mannheim). A standard curve was prepared using purified CAT, and tissue concentrations of CAT expressed as pg CAT/ml total protein were determined by comparison. 10 µg of protein were used for assay. Each sample was assayed in duplicate; the values fell within the linear portion of the standard curve. The variation in independent measurements of CAT protein for a given line was <25%. Up to 100 mg of frozen tissue was homogenized, and RNA was extracted by the Chomczinski and Sacchi procedure (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62789) Google Scholar) as described previously (13L'Horset F. Blin C. Brehier A. Thomasset M. Perret C. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed with 10 µg of total RNA. RNAs were electrophoresed in 1.5% (w/v) agarose formaldehyde gel, blotted onto filters, and hybridized with specific probes. Mouse CaBP9K mRNA was detected with a rat CaBP9K cDNA clone, and SV40 large T antigen mRNA was detected with the StuI-BamHI fragment containing the relevant region of the large T antigen. RT-PCR analyses used as primers oligonucleotides specific for the first exon of the CaBP9K gene (5′-TGTCTGACTCTGGCACGACT-3′) and for the SV40 large T antigen (5′-TAGTATGCCTTTCTCATCAGAGG-3′) to detect Tag mRNA accumulation. The CaBP9K mRNA was detected using a primer specific for the second exon (upstream primer 5′-AAATATGCAGCCAAAGA-3′) and one specific for the third exon of the rat CaBP9K gene (downstream primer 5′-AAAACTTCGAATTCTTC-3′). Oligonucleotide primers specific for the dystrophin mRNA (upstream primer 5′-TAAAGCCTGTCCCCACT-3′ specific for exon 75 and downstream primer 5′-GGAAAGCCAATGAGAGA-3′ specific for exon 78) were used as internal standards. The PCR products were electrophoresed, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with specific probes. Lung, kidney, and uterus tissues were fixed in Bouin's liquid and embedded in paraffin. Histological analysis was performed on sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin safran. The SV40 large T antigen was immunolocalized on frozen tissue sections using a specific rabbit polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. D. Hanahan, University of California, San Francisco, CA). Lung, kidney, and uterus from transgenic mice were removed, cut into small pieces, and rapidly frozen on a plastic book precooled with liquid nitrogen. Tissues were kept at −80°C until used. Frozen sections (7 µm) were cut with a cryostat (Bright), placed on gelatin-coated slides, and processed for immunofluorescence. Sections were fixed with 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, incubated with 0.25% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Boehringer Mannheim), rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the anti-large T antigen polyclonal antibody (dilution, 1:2000) for 18 h at room temperature. The sections were washed and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (dilution, 1:200; Vector) and streptavidin-fluorescein (dilution, 1:200; Vector). Control prepared by omitting the anti-Tag antibody showed no labeling (data not shown). Preparations were examined under a Zeiss photomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence optics and photographed. F1 or F2 transgenic mice (6-8 weeks old) were given two kinds of hormonal treatment. The first group, transgenic mice carrying the 9K/−4400-CAT construct (line 94) were placed in an ultraviolet light free environment and fed ad libitum with a vitamin D-deficient diet (0.5% Ca2+ and 0.36% phosphorus, from UAR, France) for 3 weeks. They were then fed a vitamin D-free, low calcium diet (0.01% Ca2+, 0.36% phosphorous) supplemented with 0.8% SrCl2 (17Perret C. Lomri N. Gouhier N. Auffray C. Thomasset M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This lead to a serum calcium level of less than 7 mg/dl. Vitamin D-injected mice (+D group) were given intraperitoneally 25 ng of 1,25(OH)2D3 in 0.1 ml of 10% ethanol, 90% sesame oil and sacrificed 24 h later. Control mice (−D) were given vehicle alone. Duodena and colons were removed, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and tested for CAT activity. The second group of transgenic mice, carrying the 9K/−117-Tag construct (line 116) were anesthesized and ovariectomized. 10 days later each mouse was fitted with an Alzet mini-pump that released 0.5 µl/h vehicle (control group, −E2) or diethylstilbestrol (100 µg/kg) (injected group, +E2) for 15 days. The mice were then sacrificed, and the uteri were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Uterine Tag were tested by RT-PCR. The developmental study was carried out on transgenic mice carrying the 9K/−4400-CAT construct (line 85). The intestines were removed from young mice (2-4 months old) and old mice (8 months old or more). Some old mice were given 1,25(OH)2D3 as described previously. Intestines (duodenum and colon) were taken for CAT assay. The role of the potential regulatory elements corresponding to the DNase I-hypersensitive sites (18Perret C. L'Horset F. Thomasset M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were investigated in vivo using three types of constructions. The 9K/−4400 construct contained 4.4 kbp of 5′-flanking region, the promoter region, the first exon, the first intron, and the beginning of the second exon (before the ATG initiation codon) was linked either to the SV40 large Tag (construct 9K/−4400-Tag) or to the CAT coding sequence (construct 9K/−4400-CAT). These constructs contained all the DNase I-hypersensitive sites (Fig. 1). The second type of construct, 9K/−1011-Tag contained only the cluster of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the promoter region of the rat CaBP9K gene (Fig. 1). This region, which contains 1011 bp of 5′ regulatory sequences, was linked to SV40 Tag. The third type of construct was a minimal construct containing only 117 bp of 5′ sequences upstream of the transcription start site linked to SV40 Tag (construct 9K/−117-Tag). All these regulatory sequences contained the ERE of the CaBP9K gene (12L'Horset F. Blin C. Colnot S. Lambert M. Thomasset M. Perret C. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These transgenes were microinjected into mouse eggs to produce founder animals. Three founders were obtained with the 9K/−4400-Tag construct; all died within 3 weeks of birth, so that no transgenic lines were obtained. A nontoxic reporter gene (CAT) was used to analyze the role of the 4.4 kbp of regulatory sequences of the rat CaBP9K gene. This construct (9K/−4400-CAT) gave six founders, which were used to establish six transgenic mouse lines (Fig. 1). Finally, two lines with the 9K/−1011-Tag construct and four lines with the 9K/−117-Tag construct were obtained (Fig. 1). The number of transgenes integrated into the DNA of each founder mouse varied from 2 to 50 copies/cell. The transmission of the transgene in all transgenic mouse lines was Mendelian. The expression of the construct bearing the longest CaBP9K 5′-flanking sequences was examined by CAT analysis of several tissues of the six mouse lines bearing the 9K/−4400-CAT construct (Fig. 1). A representative pattern of CAT distribution is shown in Fig. 2. It showed that 4.4 kbp of 5′-flanking sequences of the rat CaBP9K gene reproduced almost perfectly the pattern of expression of the endogenous CaBP9K gene. The CAT transgene was actively expressed in the duodenum, but no expression was detected in the jejunum or ileum. However, there was a strong ectopic expression of CAT in the colon, mainly in the distal part (Table I). The CAT transgene was also expressed in the kidney and uterus (Fig. 2). CAT activity in the uterus was particularly variable among females from the same line, probably because of physiological variations in the estrus cycle. No significant expression in the lung was detected. Several tissues that normally do not expressed CaBP9K (liver, spleen, brain, and muscle) were also assayed for CAT expression. No expression of CAT was detected in these tissues. Tissue-specific expression was similar in all six lines of 9K/−4400 transgenic mice, indicating that tissue specificity conferred by regulatory regions of the transgene was independent of the integration sites. However, CAT activity was not closely dependent on the number of integrated copies (Table I), although the mice of line 84 with only two copies of the transgene had a very low CAT activity. Nevertheless, TLC chromatography allowed us to measure this low CAT activity, whose distribution was similar to that in the other lines (Table I). The roles of the distal and proximal potential regulatory elements defined by the DNase I hypersensitivity study were analyzed by generating 9K/−1011-Tag and 9K/−117-Tag constructs and examining the expression of these constructs in transgenic mice (Fig. 1). The 9K/−1011-Tag transgene lacking sequences −4400 to −1011 was not expressed at all in the intestine, indicating that the deleted fragment including the distal specific HS1 DNase I-hypersensitive site is essential for intestine specificity of the CaBP9K gene. As shown on Figs. 3A et 4A, Northern blot analysis showed Tag expression for line 46 in the lung and at a weakly level in kidney and only in kidney for line 39. RT-PCR detected very little Tag gene expression in the lung of line 39 mice carrying the 9K/−1011-Tag construct, indicating that expression of the transgene was independent of copy number (data not shown). Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed that the Tag transgene was expressed in alveolar epithelial cells, as it is for the endogenous CaBP9K gene (14Dupret J.M. L'Horset F. Perret C. Bernaudin J.F. Thomasset M. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2643-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Expression of the Tag gene led to the development of lung adenocarcinoma in all line 46 mice (Fig. 3, C and D). Nuclear Tag positivity was detected in renal proximal tubule cells of line 39 mice (Fig. 4B). The expression of Tag also led to the development of dilated proximal tubules reminiscent of polycystic kidney in 80% of line 39 transgenic animals (Fig. 4, C and D). Although Tag gene expression was not detected in the uterus of young animals by Northern blot (lines 39 and 46), all 9K/−1011-Tag transgenic females later developed myometrial tumors. These tumors were uterine leiomyomas. 2B. Romagnolo, T. Molina, G. LeRoy, C. Blin, A. Porteux, M. Thomasset, A. Vandewalle, A. Kahn, and C. Perret (1996) J. Clin. Invest., in press. Deletion of sequences −1011 to −117 bp (9K/−117-Tag construct) resulted in the loss of expression of the transgene in the tissues analyzed (intestine, kidney, and lung), as judged by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). However, all the females from the four transgenic mice lines later developed uterine leiomyomas (Fig. 5A).2 Immunocytochemical analysis always detected Tag expression only in the uterine myometrial tissue (Fig. 5B). Altogether, these results indicate that the 9K/−4400 constructs containing 4.4 kb of 5′ regulatory elements possess the cis-acting elements needed to direct expression in the intestine, probably the distal intestine-specific DNase I-hypersensitive site HS1. A construct with 1011 bp of 5′-flanking sequences directed the expression in the lung, kidney, and uterus. As an endogenous gene, this transgene was expressed in epithelial alveolar cells and in uterine myometrium, whereas an unexpected expression was obtained in renal proximal tubule cells. A construct containing only −117 bp of 5′ regulatory sequences is sufficient to direct the low level expression of the transgene in the uterine myometrium. The hormonal control of transgene expression by vitamin D in the intestine and estrogen in the uterus was determined using vitamin D3-deficient transgenic mice and ovariectomized transgenic mice. The mice fed the vitamin D3-deficient diet had decreased CAT expression in the duodenum, whereas a single injection of 25 ng of 1,25(OH)2D3 restored CAT activity (Fig. 6A). Thus, both the 9K/−4400-CAT transgene and the endogenous CaBP9K are controlled by 1,25(OH)2D3 in the duodenum (Fig. 6C). This hormonal control was tissue-specific, because expression in the colon was independent of vitamin D3 (Fig. 6B). Because aging has been associated with alterations in calcium homeostasis (24Gallagher J.C. Riggs J.C. Eisman B.L. Hanstran A. Arnaud S.B. DeLuca H.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) and decreased CaBP9K gene expression (6Armbrecht H.J. Boltz M. Strong R. Richardson A. Bruns M.E.H. Christakos S. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2950-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we examined CAT expression in mice of different ages. CAT expression decreased with age (2-4 months old to 8 months old or more) (Fig. 7A). However, the age-dependent decrease in transgene expression was tissue-specific, because it occurred only in the duodenum and not in the colon (Fig. 7B). Because the serum 1,25(OH)2D3 and VDR contents decrease with age and can be partially reversed by exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 (25Wada L. Daly R. Kern D. Halloran D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 235: E338-E343Google Scholar), we examined the effect of 25 ng of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the decrease in CAT expression in old mice. Fig. 7 shows that the age-dependent decline in transgene expression in the duodenum was reversed by vitamin D3. Because the ERE of the rat CaBP9K gene was present in all constructs and the minimal promoter could direct the expression of the transgene in the myometrium, we investigated whether this ERE was functional in transgenic mice carrying the 9K/−117-Tag construct. RT-PCR detected neither Tag nor CaBP9K mRNA in uterus of ovariectomized line 116 transgenic mice but showed that they were strongly stimulated by treatment of these mice with 100 µg/kg diethylstilbestrol (Fig. 8). Thus, the 9K/−117-Tag transgene responded to estrogen in vivo, most likely via the previously characterized intragenic ERE. The CaBP9K gene provides a useful model for dissecting the regulatory elements controlling its tissue expression and hormonal regulation (1Christakos S. Gabrielides C. Rhoten W.B. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 10: 3-25Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that a specific set of tissue-specific DNaseI HS are present in the chromatin of the rat CaBP9K gene and may be involved in the complex transcriptional control of that gene (18Perret C. L'Horset F. Thomasset M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice have now been used to assess the role of these potential cis-acting elements. The present results indicate that deletion of various upstream regions of the rat CaBP9K gene has tissue-specific effects on transgene expression in the three major CaBP9K-expressing tissues, intestine, uterus, and lung. A −4400 bp 5′-flanking sequence is necessary to direct the expression of the transgene in the intestine. Deletion to −1011 abolishes the expression in the intestine, indicating that there is a strong cis-acting element between −4400 and −1011 bp involved in intest"

We demonstrated that IL-9 gene expression is controlled, at least in part, by transcriptional activation. Transient expression of the luciferase reporter gene linked to serially deleted sequences of the 5′-flanking region of the IL-9 gene has revealed several positive and negative regulatory elements involved in the basal and inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells. An AP-1 site at −146 to −140 was shown to be involved in the expression of the IL-9 gene. A proximal region between −46 and −80 was identified as the minimum sequence for the basal and inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells. Within this region, an NF-κB site at −59 to −50 and its adjacent 20-base pair upstream sequence were demonstrated to play a critical role for the IL-9 promoter activity. DNA-protein binding studies indicated that NF-κB, c-Jun, and potentially novel proteins (around 35 kDa) can bind to this important sequence. Mutations at different sites within this proximal promoter region abolished the promoter activity as well as the DNA binding. Taken together, these results suggest that the cooperation of different transcription factors is essential for IL-9 gene expression in T cells.

It has been shown that IL-9 can promote the proliferation of activated and transformed T cells, the production of immunoglobulins by B cells, the proliferation and differentiation of mast cells, and erythroid progenitors. The involvement of IL-9 in tumorigenesis has also been suggested, since: 1) the preferential expression of IL-9 was found in cell lines derived from patients with Hodgkin's disease and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (12Merz H. Houssiau F.A. Orscheschek K. Renauld J.C. Fliedner A. Herin M. Noel H. Kadin M. Mueller-Hermelink H.K. Van Snick J. Feller A.C. Blood. 1991; 78: 1311-1317Google Scholar, 13Gruss H.J.

Although it has been shown that the production of IL-9 in T cells can be induced by mitogen phorbol ester or anti-CD3 antibody (3Renauld J.C. Goethals A. Houssiau F. Merz H. Van Roost E. Van Snick J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4235-4241Google Scholar), little is known about the control mechanisms of IL-9 expression at the transcriptional level. Human IL-9 gene has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 5 at 5q31-32 (17Mock B.A. Krall M. Kozak C.A. Nesbitt M.N. McBride O.W. Renauld J.C. Van Snick J. Immunogenetics. 1990; 31: 265-270Google Scholar, 18Kelleher K. Bean K. Clark S.C. Leung W.-Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen J.W. Lin P.-F. Luo W. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1436-1441Google Scholar). Interestingly, human IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF, and IL-13 gene clusters have also been localized to the same locus (19Furth M. Greaves M. Cancer Cells: Molecular Diagnostics of Human Cancer. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 53Google Scholar, 20Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.-M. Dumont X. Guillemot J.-C. Kaghad M. Labit C. Leplatois P. Liauzun P. Miloux B. Minty C. Casellas P. Loison G. Lupker J. Shire D. Ferrara P. Caput D. Nature. 1993; 362: 248-250Google Scholar). The expression of IL-3, IL-4, GM-CSF, and IL-5 has been well studied in a variety of systems. Certain portions within the promoter regions of these genes were found to be highly conserved, and a common regulatory mechanism was suggested to be involved in the coordinated expression of these cytokines in certain cell types (21Miyatake S. Seiki M. Yoshida M. Arai K.-I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5581-5587Google Scholar, 22Miyatake S. Shlomai J. Arai K.-I. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5894-5901Google Scholar). It was noted that the 5′-flanking region of the IL-9 gene contains several putative transcriptional elements, some of which are also identified in the promoter regions of other cytokine genes mapped to the same chromosomal location (3Renauld J.C. Goethals A. Houssiau F. Merz H. Van Roost E. Van Snick J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4235-4241Google Scholar, 18Kelleher K. Bean K. Clark S.C. Leung W.-Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen J.W. Lin P.-F. Luo W. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1436-1441Google Scholar). However, unlike other cytokines, up to now, the expression of the IL-9 gene has only been detected in T cells. To understand the basis of the T cell-restricted expression of IL-9, we undertook the characterization of IL-9 upstream regulatory sequences. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a 0.9-kilobase SmaI-SacI fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the IL-9 gene contains the DNA sequences required for the basal and inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in a human T cell leukemia virus type I-transformed T cell line, C5MJ2 (18Kelleher K. Bean K. Clark S.C. Leung W.-Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen J.W. Lin P.-F. Luo W. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1436-1441Google Scholar). In the present study, we further defined the cis-acting DNA elements and characterized the trans-acting transcription factors involved in IL-9 expression following 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)/phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation. By using deletion and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified several DNA sequences in the 5′-flanking region of the IL-9 gene as important regulatory elements. Several transcription factors, including AP-1, NF-κB, and potentially novel DNA-binding proteins (around 35 kDa), were found to play critical roles in the regulation of IL-9 gene expression in C5MJ2 cells. Total RNA from C5MJ2 cells were prepared at various time points after stimulation with TPA (5 ng/ml) and PHA (10 µg/ml) (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). 10 µg of total RNA was used for Northern blot and hybridized with a 32P-labeled IL-9 cDNA probe. A human β-actin cDNA probe was hybridized to the same filter to ensure equal loading in each lane. The expression level of the IL-9 message was quantitated by densitometric scanning of IL-9 signal relative to that of the β-actin internal control. For nuclear run-on assays, the labeled run-on transcripts from 3 × 107 C5MJ2 cells were prepared as described previously (24Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Thomas S.M. DeMacro M. Brugge J.S. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Google Scholar). 5 µg of plasmids containing the inserts for human GM-CSF (as a positive control), human IL-9, human β-actin, and pBR322 (no insert) were slot-blotted onto nylon membranes and hybridized with the same amount of labeled run-on products. The transcriptional initiation site of human IL-9 in C5MJ2 cells was determined by both primer extension and RNase protection methods as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the primer extension assay, 50 µg of C5MJ2 total RNA was hybridized to 1 × 105 cpm of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide primer. The sequence of the synthetic 35-base oligonucleotide primer is 5′-TGGCCTGCCACGGAGCACAGGAGCAGGGCAGAGGT-3′, which is complementary to a region within the first exon of the human IL-9 gene (18Kelleher K. Bean K. Clark S.C. Leung W.-Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen J.W. Lin P.-F. Luo W. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1436-1441Google Scholar). The antisense RNA probe for the RNase protection assay was generated by in vitro transcription of ScaI-linearized p5928 (18Kelleher K. Bean K. Clark S.C. Leung W.-Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen J.W. Lin P.-F. Luo W. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1436-1441Google Scholar) using T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (26Zinn K. DiMaio D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1983; 34: 865-879Google Scholar). 1 × 106 cpm of antisense RNA probe was hybridized to 50 µg of C5MJ2 total RNA. The RNA-RNA hybrids were treated with RNase A and RNase T1, followed by proteinase K digestion, and finally fractionated on an 8% urea sequencing gel. DNA fragments containing various portions of the 5′-flanking region of the human IL-9 gene were generated either by restriction endonuclease digestion or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were subcloned into the SmaI/SacI sites of pXP2, a firefly luciferase reporter gene expression vector (27Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458Google Scholar). The nested deletion constructs were designated as plasmids pIL-9-D1 to pIL-9-D13. The exact position (relative to the transcription start site) of deletion in each construct is shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6A. Other mutation constructs, such as pIL-9-M1 to pIL-9-M4, pIL-9-AP1w, and pIL-9-AP1m, were generated by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing.Fig. 6Transcriptional activity of the proximal region between −80 and −47 of the IL-9 gene.

B, protein binding study. Gel shift and gel supershift assays were performed with synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides harboring wild type (AP-1w) or mutated AP-1 (AP-1m) sites. The sequences of these oligonucleotides are identical to the sequences of 5′ primers shown in (A). The nuclear extracts from unstimulated (uNE) or TPA/PHA-stimulated (sNE) C5MJ2 cells were incubated with a 32P-labeled AP-1w or AP-1m probe in the absence or presence of antibodies against c-Jun or c-Fos.

Transient transfection of C5MJ2 cells was performed by electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. 5 µg of each promoter-reporter construct plus 1 µg of the pCMV-β-gal reference plasmid were mixed with 1 × 107 C5MJ2 cells in 0.3 ml of medium and transferred into a 0.4-cm cuvette. Following a single 200-V/960-microfarad pulse, each sample was divided into two parts and maintained in 6 ml of medium with or without TPA (5 ng/ml)/PHA (10 µg/ml). 24 h after electroporation, cells were lysed for luciferase and β-galactosidase (β-gal) assays (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was normalized according to the β-gal control. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). The DNase I footprinting assay was performed according to the standard procedure with 20 µg of nuclear extract and 2 × 104 cpm of a 32P-5′-end-labeled fragment covering −125 to +8 of the 5′-flanking region of the IL-9 gene. After DNase I partial digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction, samples were electrophoresed through an 8% urea sequencing gel. A sequencing reaction was run in parallel to serve as a reference for the protected region. The gel shift assay was performed as described previously with 4 µg of the nuclear extract and 2 × 104 cpm of the probe (29Lenardo M.J. Kuang A. Gifford A. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8825-8829Google Scholar). In gel supershift experiments, the empirically determined amounts of antibodies (Abs) were preincubated, in parallel with the same amount of preimmune serum, for 40 min at 4°C with the nuclear proteins before the addition of probes. The following Abs were used for gel supershift assays: anti-c-Jun/AP-1 and anti-c-Fos/AP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p50/NF-κB, anti-c-Rel/NF-κB (30Li C.C. Korner M. Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R.M. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Google Scholar), and anti-CREB (a gift of Dr. Chou-Zen Giam). In peptide and oligonucleotide competition experiments, 2 µg of competitor peptides (30Li C.C. Korner M. Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R.M. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Google Scholar) or a 50-fold molar excess of various competitor oligonucleotides were preincubated with Abs or nuclear extracts for 10 min before the binding reactions. The sequences of AP-1, NF-κB, NF-AT, and CRE competitors are: AP-1, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (Promega); NF-κB, 5′-ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAG-3′; consensus NF-AT p/c binding motif, 5′-GATCATTTTCCGATC-3′ (31Szabo S.J.

In UV-cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assays, the bromodeoxyuridine and [32P]dCTP were introduced into the double-stranded DNA covering −76 to −58 of the IL-9 5′-flanking sequence as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After a standard DNA and protein binding reaction, the DNA-protein complexes were UV-irradiated for 1 h on ice. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 4 µg of Abs or normal rabbit IgG were added to each reaction after UV irradiation. The precipitated and UV-cross-linked proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to x-ray film. The kinetics of TPA/PHA-induced expression of the human IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells was examined by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, the steady-state level of the IL-9 mRNA was very low in unstimulated cells and can be transiently increased following TPA/PHA stimulation. The induction of the IL-9 mRNA by TPA/PHA reached the maximum level 11 h after stimulation and slowly decreased thereafter. 24 h after stimulation, the steady state level of IL-9 mRNA was still about 3 times higher than that in unstimulated cells. To determine the control mechanisms of IL-9 gene expression after TPA/PHA stimulation, nuclear run-on assays were performed to measure the transcription rate of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells following TPA/PHA treatment (Fig. 1B). In agreement with the Northern blot analysis, the rate of IL-9 gene transcription was low in unstimulated cells. The transcription rate of the IL-9 gene was drastically increased (7-fold) 2 h after stimulation, reached the peak (10-fold) at 5 h, and then gradually decreased. These results, together with the observation that the steady-state level of the IL-9 mRNA peaked at 11 h of induction (15.5-fold) in Northern blot analysis, suggest that different mechanisms are involved in the accumulation of the IL-9 message. The mRNA induction observed at the first 5 h resulted mainly from the transcriptional activation since both Northern blot and nuclear run-on analyses showed identical induction folds of the IL-9 mRNA (Fig. 1C). In contrast, a predominantly posttranscriptional event was evidenced at 11 h of activation, suggesting a shift in the mechanisms regulating IL-9 mRNA accumulation from the transcriptional to the posttranscription level, most likely through increasing the stability of the message. Transcription initiation site for the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells was determined by primer extension and RNase protection methods. In primer extension experiments, two bands with different densities were observed by using total RNA from activated C5MJ2 cells (Fig. 2, lane 6). The major band (82%) was 80 bases in length, indicating IL-9 gene transcription mainly initiated at 24 bases upstream from the translation start codon ATG and 25 bases downstream from the TATA box. The minor band (18%), 3 bases longer than the main band, was probably an overextended product. In RNase protection assays, one protected band was obtained with total RNA from both unstimulated and stimulated cells (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8) following RNase digestion. The size of the protected fragment corresponds to the size of the major band derived from the primer extension experiment, suggesting that transcription initiates at base 880 (according to the numbering system in the published human IL-9 genomic sequence; 18Kelleher K. Bean K. Clark S.C. Leung W.-Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen J.W. Lin P.-F. Luo W. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1436-1441Google Scholar). This base is therefore considered as the transcription initiation site of the IL-9 gene and all the IL-9 sequences in this paper will be numbered accordingly. Our 5′-mapping results were slightly different from the ones mapped in stimulated PBMC cells (3Renauld J.C. Goethals A. Houssiau F. Merz H. Van Roost E. Van Snick J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4235-4241Google Scholar), which probably reflect the differences in the control mechanisms of IL-9 gene expression in different cell lines. We have demonstrated previously that a 0.9-kilobase 5′-flanking region of the human IL-9 gene was able to direct the reporter gene expression in response to TPA/PHA stimulation in C5MJ2 cells (18Kelleher K. Bean K. Clark S.C. Leung W.-Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen J.W. Lin P.-F. Luo W. Yang Y.-C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1436-1441Google Scholar). To further identify regions of possible functional significance within this 0.9-kilobase sequence, a series of deletion mutants were constructed for transient expression in C5MJ2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, the expression level of the luciferase reporter gene was steadily increased when the DNA sequence between −878 and −379 was deleted, implying the existence of negative control elements in this region. The luciferase activity fluctuated between −379 and −143: the expression level reached the maximum with construct pIL-9-D4 (−379) and decreased about 2-fold with construct pIL-9-D5 (−299); After deletion of another 86-base pair sequence (−213, pIL-9-D6), the reporter gene expression increased again, especially after TPA/PHA induction; When an additional 70-base pair sequence was deleted (−143, pIL-9-D7), the luciferase activity decreased 5–6-fold. These results suggested that there are several positive and negative regulatory elements present between −379 and −143. Through computer search, several DNA sequences within −379 to −143 were found to be similar to the binding sites of certain known transcription factors. These sites included a κB-like binding motif at −331 to −317, an Sp1-like site at −317 to −307, an AP-3-like site at −306 to −298, and an AP-1-like site at −146 to −140. Except the AP-1-like site, none of the other sites were demonstrated to be important in controlling IL-9 gene transcription by mutagenesis studies (data not shown). The AP-1-like site at −146 to −140 was demonstrated to be functional in IL-9 gene expression, since both basal and TPA/PHA-inducible luciferase activities decreased about 2–3-fold when this site was mutated (Fig. 4A). This AP-1-like site differs from the AP-1 consensus sequence by only one nucleotide. The nuclear proteins binding to this site were found to be inducible by TPA/PHA stimulation in the gel shift assay (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Mutations at this AP-1 site abolished formation of the DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 4B, lane 3). These DNA-binding proteins were suggested to be c-Jun and c-Fos by the gel supershift assay, since anti-c-Jun antibody supershifted the retarded band and anti-c-Fos antibody inhibited the formation of the DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). The sequence between −125 and −46 appeared to be essential for the constitutive and TPA/PHA-inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells (Fig. 3). The construct pIL-9-D9 (−46) showed very low basal level reporter gene expression and failed to respond to TPA induction. An 8-fold (uninduced) and 24-fold (TPA/PHA-induced) increase in promoter activity was noted when −125 to −47 sequence was added. To localize the DNA sequences interacting with nuclear proteins, DNase I footprinting was performed using a 5′-end-labeled probe covering −125 to +7. As indicated in Fig. 5, the region from position −45 to −80 was protected from DNase I digestion, suggesting that DNA-protein interactions exist within this region. To identify the minimum sequence that mediates the basal and TPA-induced expression of the IL-9 gene, the deletion mutants within the proximal region from −90 to −63 of the IL-9 promoter were constructed. They were designated as phIL-9-D10 to phIL-9-D13, beginning at −90, −80, −74, and −63, respectively. Transient expression of these constructs in C5MJ2 cells showed that phIL-9-D10 and phIL-9-D11 generated luciferase activities comparable to phIL-9-D8 (−125), but a 5–10-fold decrease in luciferase activity was observed in transfections with constructs phIL-9-D12 and IL-9-D13, respectively (Fig. 6A). Since phIL-9-D9 (−47) had very low level of luciferase expression (Fig. 3), DNA cis-elements were proposed to be localized in the region between −47 and −80. This result is consistent with that of the DNase I footprinting assay. A closer inspection of the sequences between −47 and −80 revealed two sites highly homologous to the consensus sequences for NF-κB and cAMP response element (CRE). The NF-κB-like binding motif (GGGTTTTTCC) is located at −59 to −50, and the CRE-like motif (TGATGTCA) is immediately upstream from this NF-κB site. To investigate whether these two sites and their neighboring sequences contribute to the promoter activity, mutations were introduced into these two potential binding sites as well as their adjacent upstream sequences. As shown in Fig. 6B, any mutation within the NF-κB-like binding motif (phIL-9-M3), the CRE-like site (phIL-9-M2) or its adjacent 6-base pair upstream sequence (phIL-9-M1) caused a 90% decrease in the basal level and TPA/PHA-induced expression of the reporter gene. Simultaneous mutations at these three sites (phIL-9-M4) almost completely abolished the promoter activity. These results indicated that the three different sites are very important for IL-9 gene expression and they are likely to regulate transcription of the IL-9 gene in a cooperative manner in C5MJ2 cells. To determine whether NF-κB, CREB, and other transcription factors are involved in the binding to the proximal region between −47 and −80, the gel shift assays were performed with DNA fragments spanning from −47 to −90 (Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7B, nuclear extracts from both unstimulated and stimulated cells formed DNA-protein complexes with this sequence. It was noticed that TPA/PHA stimulation increased the intensity of the major DNA-protein complexes. To identify individual binding sites, competition experiments were carried out with DNA fragments bearing different binding motifs of several transcription factors. Our data showed that proteins binding to this sequence are specific and the binding could be competed by unlabeled DNA fragment containing human immunodeficiency virus NF-κB motif, but not by unlabeled DNA fragments containing the binding motifs for NF-AT p/c, AP-1, and CREB (Fig. 7B). To further characterize proteins binding to this region, gel supershift assays were performed using specific antibodies against NF-κB, CREB, c-Jun, and c-Fos. As shown in Fig. 7C, NF-κB was demonstrated to be one of the components in the DNA-protein complexes since antibodies raised against both Rel and p50 of NF-κB could supershift the complexes (lanes 5 and 7) and the supershift pattern could be reversed by the addition of excess amount of NF-κB peptides (lanes 6 and 8). The anti-c-Jun antibody was also shown to be able to shift the DNA-protein complexes in the supershift assay (lane 2), but anti-c-Fos and anti-CREB antibodies failed to shift the retarded band. The CRE-like motif 5′TGATGTCA 3′ at −67 to −60 differs from CRE consensus sequence 5′TGACGTCA 3′ by a single base substitution. This variant CRE sequence has been shown to have a markedly reduced binding affinity for CREB (32Bokar J.A. Keri R.A. Farmerie T.A. Fenstermaker R.A. Anderson B. Hamernik D.L. Yun J. Wagner T. Nilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5113-5122Google Scholar). Our gel supershift assays and competition experiments also suggested that CRE and CREB may not be involved in the regulation of IL-9 expression. To characterize proteins binding to the upstream region of the NF-κB site, the UV-cross-linking assay was performed to identify proteins binding to the sequence between −77 and −58. As shown in Fig. 7D, several proteins (around 92, 40, and 35 kDa) from nuclear extract of stimulated cells were cross-linked to the DNA probe (lane 2). UV-cross-linking performed with oligonucleotides mutated at two sites demonstrated to be important by functional studies resulted in the disappearance or decrease in intensity of proteins around 40 and 35 kDa, suggesting that the proteins of 40 and 35 kDa are specific DNA-binding proteins (lane 3). The 40-kDa protein was inducible and was demonstrated to be c-Jun by immunoprecipitation of the UV-cross-linked proteins with anti-c-Jun antibody (lane 4). To further investigate whether proteins binding to the proximal region correlates with regulation of the IL-9 gene expression, we used oligonucleotides with mutations within the NF-κB and its adjacent upstream region as the probes in the gel shift assay (Fig. 7, A and E). As compared with wild type sequence, mutations within the NF-κB motif or its adjacent 20-base pair upstream sequence hindered the DNA-protein complexes formation (Fig. 7E, lanes 2–4). Simultaneous mutations of NF-κB and its adjacent 20-base pair upstream sequence completely abolished the formation of DNA-protein complexes (lane 5). These results correlated well with the functional study (Fig. 6B), in which IL-9 promoter constructs containing the same mutations generated much lower luciferase activities as compared to the wild type construct, demonstrating that synergistic binding of these different transcription factors to the same promoter region is crucial for the expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells. In this study, the up-regulation of IL-9 gene expression in C5MJ2 cells was shown to be regulated, at least in part, by transcriptional activation. Functional analysis of the 5′-flanking sequence of the IL-9 gene revealed several positive and negative regions controlling IL-9 gene expression. One positive region includes an AP-1 site at −146 to −140, which was demonstrated to be involved in the expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells. Members of the AP-1 protein family have been reported to be involved in the expression of IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and GM-CSF in T cells by working independently or cooperatively with other transcription factors, such as NF-AT and Oct1 (33Muegge K.

Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1240-1251Google Scholar). In this study, AP-1 protein was found not only to bind to the AP-1 site at −146 to −140, but also to participate in the formation of DNA-protein complexes binding to another important proximal region (−80 to −47) of the IL-9 promoter. Therefore, AP-1 appears to be an important general transcription factor involved in the up-regulation of a large number of cytokines in activated T cells. The second positive regulatory region resides within positions −80 to −47 of the IL-9 promoter. Our study revealed that this region is absolutely required for IL-9 gene expression. The DNA sequence within this proximal region is highly conserved in evolution (identical between human and mouse IL-9 promoters). Within this region, an NF-κB motif at −59 to −50 as well as its 20-base pair adjacent upstream sequence were demonstrated to be critical since mutations at one or both sites drastically decreased the promoter activity. The direct interaction of NF-κB with this region was also confirmed by competition experiments and the gel supershift assay. NF-κB or related proteins have been shown to play important roles in the expression of several cytokines (37Jenkins F. Cockerill P.N. Bohmann D. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1240-1251Google Scholar, 38Hoyos B. Ballard D.W. Boohnlein E. Siekevitz M. Greene W.C. Science. 1989; 244: 457-460Google Scholar, 39Libermann T.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1281-1286Google Scholar). NF-κB is required for the activation of GM-CSF gene by various mitogens in T cells (37Jenkins F. Cockerill P.N. Bohmann D. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1240-1251Google Scholar, 41Shreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1281-1286Google Scholar). Unlike GM-CSF gene, the position of this NF-κB motif in IL-9 promoter is located much closer to the TATA box. Compared with this NF-κB site in the IL-9 promoter, a stretch of DNA sequence referred to as the conserved lymphokin element 0 (CLE0) was found in the promoter regions of the GM-CSF, IL-4, and IL-5 genes (22Miyatake S. Shlomai J. Arai K.-I. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5894-5901Google Scholar). CLE0, regarded as an essential cis-element, is required for the expression of GM-CSF, IL-4, and IL-5 genes in activated T cells and contains composite binding site for AP-1/Ets or NF-AT factors (22Miyatake S. Shlomai J. Arai K.-I. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5894-5901Google Scholar, 31Szabo S.J. Gold J.S. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4793-4850Google Scholar, 37Jenkins F.

The binding sequences for NF-κB, Ets and NF-AT proteins are quite similar, all of which have the AAAGG motif. The similarity suggests that promoters of those cytokines on chromosome 5 may be evolutionarily related and also raises the possibility that the T cell-restricted expression of IL-9 may be attributed to the unique feature of its promoter sequence. It should be pointed out that in addition to NF-κB binding to the proximal region between −80 and −47, c-Jun and the proteins of 35 kDa have also been shown to specifically bind to this functional region. c-Jun may bind to the CRE-like site at −67 to −60, since probes with mutations within this CRE-like motif failed to give rise to the supershifted band using anti-c-Jun in our gel supershift assay (data not shown). The nature of 35-kDa proteins remains unclear. It was noticed that a GATA binding motif 5′-TGATAC-3′ exists at position −76 to −71 on the minus strand of the IL-9 promoter, and mutations containing this GATA binding site (pIL-9-M1) reduced reporter gene expression. At present, four members of GATA family transcription factors have been characterized (44Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Google Scholar, 45Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Google Scholar). Among them, only GATA-3 is predominantly present in T cells and is involved in the regulation of several T cell-specific genes (46Yamamoto M. Ko L.J. Leonard M.W. Beug H. Orkin S.H. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1650-1662Google Scholar, 47Ho I.C. Vorhees P. Marin N. Okaley B.K. Tsai S.F. Orkin S.H. Leiden J.M.

Recently, IL-5 was shown to be activated by GATA-3 in T cells (43Siegel M.D. Zhang D.-H. Ray P. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24548-24555Google Scholar). Since the molecular masses of GATA-3 proteins are around 45 kDa, it is unlikely that the 35-kDa UV-cross-linked proteins are GATA-3. In summary, our results suggest that synergistic interactions of known and unknown transcription factors are likely to play a critical role in the regulation of IL-9 expression. As indicated by our study, several proteins can bind to the proximal region between −80 and −47. Mutations at different sites within this region not only decreased reporter gene expression but also abolished the formation of specific DNA-protein complexes. In addition to this important proximal region, we have also demonstrated that the AP-1 site at −146 to −140 can be regulated by AP-1 proteins to enhance IL-9 promoter activity, implying “cross-talk” and cooperation may exist between these two regions and among the different transcription factors. The cooperation of multiple transcription factors has been shown to be involved in the expression of IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF in T cells (37Jenkins F. Cockerill P.N. Bohmann D. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1240-1251Google Scholar, 49Kaushansky K. Shoemaker S.G. O'Rork C.A. McCarty J.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1812-1820Google Scholar). For IL-9 gene expression, its T cell-restricted expression pattern may be mediated by certain unknown T cell-specific transcription factors and/or by a unique profile of combinatorial interactions of common transcription factors.

https://openalex.org/W2017073351,"Blood coagulation factor Xa (FXa) has recently been shown to function as a plasminogen receptor in the presence of procoagulant phospholipid (phosphatidylserine; PS) and Ca2+. In the current work, the possible effect of autoproteolytic and plasmin-mediated cleavage of FXa on complex formation with plasminogen was investigated. 125I-plasminogen binding to derivatives of FXa electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride revealed that the autoproteolytic conversion of FXaα to FXaβ was required for the expression of a plasminogen binding site. In the presence of PS and Ca2+, plasmin was shown to convert FXaα to a FXaβ-like species at least 3 orders of magnitude faster than the autoproteolytic mechanism. This also resulted in the exposure of a plasminogen binding site. Further processing by plasmin generated a fragment (33 kDa) due to cleavage at Gly331 in the FXa heavy chain. Production of this species enhanced apparent plasminogen binding compared with FXaβ and resulted in the loss of FXa amidolytic and clotting activity. In the absence of either PS or Ca2+, the plasmin-mediated fragmentation of FXaα was altered to include a FXaβ-like molecule and a species (40 kDa) with intact β-heavy chain disulfide linked to a COOH-terminal fragment of the light chain starting at Tyr44. Neither of these products was observed to interact with plasminogen. The 40-kDa species had amidolytic activity comparable with FXaα but inhibited clotting activity. Cumulatively the data provide the first evidence for a functional difference between the FXa subforms and suggest a mechanism where autoproteolysis and plasmin-mediated cleavage modulate the function of FXaα from a procoagulant enzyme to a profibrinolytic plasminogen receptor.

https://openalex.org/W1965975163,"The lysosomal β-hexosaminidases are dimers composed of α and β subunits. β-Hexosaminidase A (αβ) is a heterodimer, whereas hexosaminidase B (ββ) and S (αα) are homodimers. Although containing a high degree of amino acid identity, each subunit expresses a unique active site that can be distinguished by a differential ability to hydrolyze charged substrates. The site on the β-subunit primarily degrades neutral substrates, whereas the α-subunit site is, in addition, active against sulfated substrates. Isozyme specificity is also exhibited with glycolipid substrates. Among human isozymes, only β-hexosaminidase A together with the GM2 activator protein can degrade the natural substrate, GM2 ganglioside, at physiologically significant rates. To identify the domains of the human β-hexosaminidase subunits that determine substrate specificity, we have generated chimeric subunits containing both α- and β-subunit sequences. The chimeric constructs were expressed in HeLa cells to screen for activity and then selected constructs were produced in the baculovirus expression system to assess their ability to degrade GM2 ganglioside in the presence of GM2 activator protein. Generation of activity against the sulfated substrate required the substitution of two noncontinuous α-subunit sequences (amino acids 1-191 and 403-529) into analogous positions of the β-subunit. Chimeric constructs containing only one of these regions linked to the β-subunit sequence showed either neutral substrate activity only (amino acids 1-191) or lacked enzyme activity entirely (amino acids 403-529). Neither the chimeras nor the wild-type subunits displayed activator-dependent GM2-hydrolyzing activity when expressed alone. However, one chimeric subunit containing α amino acids 1-191 fused with β amino acids 225 to 556, when co-expressed with the wild-type α-subunit, showed activity comparable with that of recombinant β-hexosaminidase A formed by the co-expression of the α- and β-subunits.

This result indicates that the β-subunit amino acids 225-556 contribute an essential function in the GM2-hydrolyzing activity of β-hexosaminidase A. The human β-hexosaminidases (EC) are dimeric lysosomal enzymes composed of two subunits, α- and β, that share about 60% of their amino acid sequence (1Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dimerization of the subunits is required for acquisition of enzymatic activity. When properly folded and assembled the enzymes are transferred to the Golgi apparatus for synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker. Mannose 6-phosphate receptors then target the enzymes to lysosomes where the precursor subunits are proteolytically processed to their mature forms (for reviews see 3Sandhoff K. Conzelmann E.

The β-hexosaminidases participate in the degradation of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans through the removal of terminal β-glycosidically linked N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine residues. The capacity of this enzyme system to degrade this range of substrates is due, in part, to a unique active site with distinct specificities carried by each subunit (5Kytzia H.-J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7568-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-subunit active site predominantly hydrolyzes neutral substrates, whereas the α-subunit active site can also react with negatively charged substrates. In addition, certain glycolipid substrates, such as GM2 ganglioside, 1The abbreviations used are: GM2 gangliosideGalNAcβ1 → 4(NeuAcα2 → 3)Galβ1 → 4Glcβ1 → 1CerMU-GlcNAc4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosideMU-GlcNAc-6-SO44-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosideDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumpBSpBluescript II KSFBSfetal bovine serum. show a strict isozyme dependence for their degradation. Of the three isozymes, only the heterodimer β-hexosaminidase A, together with the GM2 activator protein, is able to degrade GM2 ganglioside significantly (6Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The GM2 activator protein functions by binding the ganglioside substrate and interacting with β-hexosaminidase A effecting release of the terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue from the ganglioside (5Kytzia H.-J.

The importance of this enzyme system is demonstrated by the consequences of mutations in the genes that encode the α-subunit, the β-subunit, or the GM2 activator. Mutations in the HEXA gene cause Tay-Sachs disease as a result of a deficiency of the α-subunit and a resulting absence of β-hexosaminidase A and S. Mutations in the HEXB gene encoding the β-subunit cause Sandhoff's disease and result in the absence of β-hexosaminidase A and B. Defects in the GM2A gene result in GM2 activator deficiency. In each of these disorders there is a massive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neuronal lysosomes leading to severe neurodegeneration. The goal of this work was to identify the domains that confer distinctive substrate specificity to the hexosaminidase isozymes. Our approach was to create chimeric hexosaminidase subunits by interchanging analogous regions of the α- and β-subunits. We expected that some chimeric subunits would be enzymatically active due to the high degree of structural similarity shared between the two subunits. Using these chimeras, we have defined two noncontiguous sequences on the α-subunit that, substituted into the β-subunit, confer the ability to degrade a charged substrate. Further, we have localized the region of the β-subunit required for activator-dependent GM2 ganglioside degradation by β-hexosaminidase A. The human β-hexosaminidase α- and β subunit cDNA were subcloned into pBluescript II KS (pBS) (Stratagene) as described (9Yamanaka S. Johnson O.J. Norflus F. Boles D.J. Proia R.L. Genomics. 1994; 21: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to produce pBSα and pBSβ, respectively. The open reading frame of the β-subunit coding sequence (1Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1883-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in construct pBSβ begins at the second methionine in the sequence shown in Fig. 1. To avoid confusion, the numbering system used for the β-subunit begins with the first methionine shown in Fig. 1. Translation initiation from any of the first 3 methionines has been shown to produce an active enzyme (10Sonderfeld-Fresko S. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13463-13469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To construct chimeras, regions of pBSβ were removed by digestion at unique restriction enzyme sites and were replaced with the analogous α-subunit cDNA sequence. To make the αβ1 construct, pBSβ was digested with NcoI (cDNA site) and XbaI (polylinker site). The corresponding α-subunit cDNA sequence, nucleotides 1-573, was amplified with primers containing a NcoI site (restriction sites underlined), 5′-CCCCATCCAGAGTGTCCAGGATGC-3′, and a XbaI site, 5′-GGGCAGCGGGCCATGACAAGCTCCAGGCTTTGG-3′. The resulting fragment was cut with NcoI and XbaI and subcloned into the NcoI/XbaI-digested pBSβ. To make the βα1 enzyme construct, nucleotides 1206-1590 of the α-subunit cDNA sequence were amplified by primers containing a Bsu36I site (5′-CCCGAGCTGGAACTG-3′) and an XhoI site (5′-GGGGGGGCTCAGGTCTGTTCAAACTCCTGCTCACAG-3′). The resulting fragment was digested with Bsu36I and XhoI, purified by low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis and subcloned into Bsu36I- (cDNA site) and XhoI-digested (polylinker site) pBSβ. The αβα1 construct was made by subcloning the polymerase chain reaction amplified sequence of the α-subunit cDNA (nucleotides 1-573) into NcoI- (cDNA site) and XbaI-digested (polylinker site) βα1. To make the αβα2 construct, nucleotides 1149-1590 of the α-sequence were amplified with a primer containing a HindIII site (5′-AGCACAGCCAGACACAATCATACA-3′) and the XhoI site containing primer used to make βα1. The resulting α-subunit cDNA fragment was then digested with HindIII and XhoI and subcloned into HindIII- (cDNA site) and XhoI-digested (polylinker site) αβ1. To make the αβα3 and βα2 constructs, nucleotides 1519-1590 of the cDNA sequence were amplified with a primer containing a PstI site (5′-ACCGGTTGCTGAGGCGAGGTGTCCAG-3′) and the XhoI containing primer used to make the αβα2 and βα1 constructs. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was then digested with PstI and XhoI, gel purified, and subcloned into PstI (cDNA site) and XhoI (polylinker site) digested pBSβ or αβ1. The sequences of the polymerase chain reaction generated regions of cDNA constructs were checked by dideoxy-sequencing with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) for potential errors generated during the procedure. Standard molecular biology techniques were performed according to Sambrook et al. (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Sf9 cells were grown in spinner flasks at 26°C in Grace's media containing 10% FBS. High-Five cells were grown in monolayer in Grace's medium with 10% serum and were passaged by pipetteing medium over the monolayer of cells and replating at a 1:10 dilution. Chimeric enzyme constructs were expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia/T7 expression system (12Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) as has been described (9Yamanaka S. Johnson O.J. Norflus F. Boles D.J. Proia R.L. Genomics. 1994; 21: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were plated 1 day prior to the transfection in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in DMEM with 10% FBS. Before infection, 0.5 ml of recombinant vaccinia virus (5.2 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml) was digested for 0.5 h with 0.5 ml of crystalline trypsin phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 at 37°C. The vaccinia/trypsin mixture was then diluted with 0.5 ml of 1% FBS/DMEM for each well used in the experiment. The cells were then washed in DMEM without serum and incubated for 0.5 h in 0.5 ml of the diluted vaccinia/trypsin mixture. The transfection mixture was prepared by mixing, for each well, 17 µl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc./BRL) and 5 µg of DNA in 1.5 ml of serum-free medium and incubating for 0.5 h at room temperature before adding to the cells. After a 5 h of incubation with the cells, 2 ml of 10% FBS containing DMEM was added, and the following day cell lysates were assayed for β-hexosaminidase enzyme activity with 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside (MU-GlcNAc) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside (MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4) as described (10Sonderfeld-Fresko S. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13463-13469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The baculovirus containing the human β-subunit cDNA has been described (13Boose J.A. Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Myerowitz R. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A baculovirus containing the human α-subunit was generated by the same procedure (13Boose J.A. Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Myerowitz R. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To produce baculovirus containing αβ1 and αβα1, Sf9 cells were first co-transfected with linearized Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA and pBlueBacII (Invitrogen) containing the appropriate construct using cationic liposomes. Resulting recombinant virus was purified from the transfection supernatant by two rounds of plaque purification. Because the pBlueBac II vector co-expresses β-galactosidase, recombinant plaques were distinguished by the blue color in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside and the absence of occlusion bodies. Recombinant viral plaques were further identified by screening for MU-GlcNAc and MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 hydrolyzing activity. Viral stocks were generated by large scale infection of 2 × 108 Sf9 cells in suspension culture and titered in High-Five cells (Invitrogen) using the Quick-titer kit from Kemp Biotechnologies Inc. Large scale expression of β-hexosaminidase and chimeric enzyme constructs was accomplished in High-Five cells (Invitrogen) by Kemp Biotechnologies Inc. For co-infection studies, the optimal multiplicity of infection for co-expression of chimeric and wild-type cDNA constructs was determined by isoelectric focusing of the High-Five cell conditioned medium (described below). The cells were incubated at the appropriate multiplicity of infections in 5 ml of serum-free Grace's medium for 4 h on a rocking platform. After the incubation, the cells were washed and incubated with 5 ml of serum-free medium for 3 days. The enzymes were obtained from the serum-free culture medium of infected cells. The enzymes were partially purified on a column of concanavalin A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (13Boose J.A. Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Myerowitz R. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Column fractions containing MU-GlcNAc hydrolyzing activity were pooled and concentrated with an Amicon PM-10 membrane. The resulting concentrate was run on an 8% precast Tris-glycine gel (Novex) and stained with Coomassie Blue to evaluate purity and to estimate enzyme protein concentration. Cell lysates or media were analyzed by either 8 or 12% SDS-Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels or pH 3-10 isoelectric focusing pre-cast gels from Novex. Isoelectric focusing gels were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 0.7% acetic acid at 10 V for 1 h using an Novex transfer apparatus. SDS-Tris/glycine gels were transferred in 39 mM glycine, 48 mM Tris base, 0.037% SDS, 20% methanol at 250 milliamps for 0.5 h at 4°C. Membranes were probed with goat anti-human β-hexosaminidase A (14Hasilik A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4937-4945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as 1°C antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG as 2°C antibody according to the protocol in the ECL Western detection kit from Amersham Corp. The Km and Vmax values for recombinant β-hexosaminidase S and B and the chimeric enzymes αβα1 and αβ1 were determined by the graphic method of Lineweaver and Burk (15Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (8027) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were measured as described (5Kytzia H.-J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7568-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using various concentrations of the synthetic substrates MU-GlcNAc (0-2.5 mM in 100 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.5) and MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 (0-1.0 mM in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.0), respectively. Enzyme kinetics of all recombinant proteins followed Michaelis-Menten theory. The apparent Vmax values were calculated for the pure enzymes based on their protein percentage of the concanavalin A fraction as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands of concanavalin A purified recombinant hexosaminidases (∼10 µg/lane) from the insect cell expression system were compared with various amounts of bovine serum albumin (0.5-10 µg) by densitometric scanning. The purities determined this way were 74% for β-hexosaminidase S, 43% for β-hexosaminidase B, 43% for αβα1, and 80% for αβ1. Aliquots of serum-free High-Five cell expression medium were dialyzed against water containing 0.1% NaN3. Assays were incubated for 4.5 h at 37°C in 80 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.0, 0.01% NaN3 containing 10 µg of bovine serum albumin, 5 nmol 3H-GM2 ganglioside (3.6 Ci/mol) tritiated in the GalNAc moiety, 10 µl of recombinant GM2 activator protein purified from Escherichia coli (16Klima H. Klein A. van Echten G. Schwarzmann G. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (1.6 µg) with 25 µl of dialyzed expression medium. After the incubation 500 µl of 1 mM aqueous GalNAc was added, and the solution was loaded onto rp-18 columns that were washed with 2 × 1 ml, 1 mM GalNAc-solution. The combined effluents containing the liberated radioactive N-acetyl-D-galactosamine were collected in scintillation vials, and their radioactivity was measured. The α- and β-subunits of β-hexosaminidase share about 60% of their amino acid sequence (1Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1883-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Korneluk R.G. Mahuran D.J. Neote K. Klavins M.H. O'Dowd B.F. Tropak M. Willard H.F. Anderson M.J. Lowden J.A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8407-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Chimeric hexosaminidase subunits were constructed by interchanging cDNA sequences encoding analogous segments of the α- and β-subunits (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The constructs were positioned adjacent to the T7 polymerase promoter in the pBluescript vector so that expression of the constructs could be driven by T7 polymerase after their transfection into HeLa cells. In the representative experiment shown in Fig. 3, the extracts from the transfected HeLa cells were first assessed by Western blot analysis to ensure protein expression (Fig. 3A) and then for enzyme activity using the neutral (MU-GlcNAc) and the charged (MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4) synthetic substrates. Polypeptides, reactive with anti-β-hexosaminidase A, were expressed from each chimeric construct that were similar (60-70 kDa) but not identical in electrophoretic mobility to the wild-type subunit precursors. The wild-type enzymes demonstrated the expected specificity: β-hexosaminidase S, produced by expressing the wild-type α-subunit, cleaved both the MU-GlcNAc and MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 substrates. By contrast, β-hexosaminidase B, produced from expressing the β-subunit, showed a marked preference for the neutral MU-GlcNAc substrate and, correspondingly, a very low ratio of sulfated to neutral substrate cleaved. Chimeric construct, αβ1, containing the amino-terminal residues 1-191 of the α-subunit fused to the carboxyl-terminal amino acids 225-556 of the β-subunit, was active against the MU-GlcNAc with relatively little activity against the MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 substrate in a manner similar to wild-type β-subunit. A number of other α-β constructs were prepared containing both larger and smaller segments of the α-subunit at the amino terminus, but they were all catalytically inactive (not shown). Also inactive was construct βα1, which consisted of amino-terminal β-subunit sequence up to amino acid 431 linked to α-subunit sequence from amino acid 403 to the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1 and 2).Fig. 3Expression of β-hexosaminidase chimeric subunits in HeLa cells. A, HeLa cells were infected with vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase and subsequently transfected with the indicated constructs or with pBluescript. After 18 h, a portion of the cell extracts (10 µl) were electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and then visualized with antibody to β-hexosaminidase A as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The molecular mass standards (in kilodaltons) are indicated to the left of the photograph. The same HeLa cells extracts were assayed with MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 (C) and MU-GlcNAc (B). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the activity that releases 1 nmol of 4-methylumbelliferone/mg of cell protein/h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an attempt to prepare an active chimera with MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 activity, we modified construct αβ1 by replacing the β-subunit carboxyl-terminal portion with the analogous α-subunit sequence 403-529 so that this construct contained the same amino-terminal segment as αβ1 (active only against MU-GlcNAc) and the same carboxyl-terminal segment as βα1 (inactive). This construct, αβα1, with both the amino and carboxyl ends comprised of α-subunit sequence, now exhibited activity against the sulfated substrate and showed a ratio of sulfated to neutral substrate cleaved similar to the wild-type α-subunit. The ability to degrade the sulfated substrate was maintained when the carboxyl-terminal segment was increased to 146 amino acids of α-sequence in αβα2 but was lost when the α-segment was reduced to 23 amino acids in αβα3. Chimera αβα3 was, however, active against the neutral MU-GlcNAc substrate. Construct βα2, the same as αβα3 but without the amino-terminal α-segment, was also active against MU-GlcNAc only. Construct βα2 was the only catalytically active construct out of several prepared with β-sequence at the amino terminus fused to α sequence at the carboxyl terminus (not shown). These data (summarized in Fig. 2) indicate that the minimum regions required for MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 activity include α-subunit sequences 1-191 and 403-529; other constructs in which these regions are replaced with β sequence are either active only against MU-GlcNAc or inactive. We next investigated the activator-dependent GM2 ganglioside hydrolyzing activity of chimeric hexosaminidase subunits. However, expression of the enzymes using the vaccinia-T7 polymerase system in HeLa cells or in COS-1 cells after insertion of the constructs in SV-40-based expression vectors proved unsatisfactory because of a high background GM2 ganglioside degrading activity inherent in the human and monkey cells. We, therefore, chose the baculovirus expression system because of the potential for very high levels of protein production and because of very low background activity. We analyzed two representative chimeric enzymes, αβα1 and αβ1, in this manner. Apparent Km and Vmax values for MU-GlcNAc and MU-GlcNAc-SO4 were first determined for the chimeric enzymes and for recombinant β-hexosaminidase S and B produced by expression of the wild-type α- and β-subunit, respectively (Table I). Like β-hexosaminidase B, chimeric construct αβ1 displayed a lower Km with MU-GlcNAc compared with MU-GlcNAc-SO4. By contrast, β-hexosaminidase S and the chimeric construct, αβα1, both of which display activity against the sulfated substrate, showed a lower Km with MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 relative to MU-GlcNAc. All enzymes developed the greatest maximal velocity with the MU-GlcNAc substrate. However, the ratio of Vmax with MU-GlcNAc to Vmax with MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 was considerably larger for recombinant β-hexosaminidase B (∼150) and αβ1 (∼60) than for recombinant β-hexosaminidase S (∼2) and αβα1 (∼3).Table I.Km and Vmax values of recombinant β-hexosaminidase isozymes and chimeras expressed in the baculovirus system and partially purified toward the synthetic substrates MU-GlcNAc and MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4EnzymeMU-GlcNAcMU-GlcNAc-6-SO4KmVmaxKmVmaxmmmol/min/mgmmmol/min/mg&β-Hexosaminidase S (wild-type α-subunit)1.741.2 &×&10−40.716.8 &×&10−5&β-Hexosaminidase B (wild-type β-subunit)0.572.2 &×&10−41.21.4 &×&10−6&αβ1aFor an explanation see Fig. 2.0.583.6 &×&10−49.35.7 &×&10−6&αβα1aFor an explanation see Fig. 2.0.736.2 &×&10−50.252.0 &×&10−5a For an explanation see Fig. 2. Open table in a new tab None of the constructs (α-subunit, β-subunit, αβα1, or αβ1) produced significant activator-dependent GM2 ganglioside degrading activity when expressed alone (Fig. 4). In contrast, co-expression of the wild-type α- and β-subunits, to produce β-hexosaminidase A yielded significant activator-dependent GM2 ganglioside hydrolyzing activity. We next co-expressed the chimeric subunits with each wild-type subunit in order to assemble heterologous subunits. The assembly of the various subunit combinations was verified by isoelectric focusing (not shown). However, only the combination of αβ1 and the wild-type α-subunit resulted in activity comparable with the co-expression of wild-type α- and β-subunits. All other combinations were not effective in the activator-dependent GM2 ganglioside degradation assay. This result indicates that the β-subunit amino acids 225-556 contribute an essential function in combination with the wild-type α-subunit for effective activator-dependent degradation of GM2 ganglioside. The α- and β-subunits of β-hexosaminidase are the product of a gene duplication event (1Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1883-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and as a result, they show a high degree of structural and functional similarity. It is also likely that the structure of the active site in each subunit is very similar, although differences obviously exist that are responsible for their characteristic specificity. In addition to their active sites, the subunits express other distinctive functions related to the binding of the GM2 ganglioside activator complex (6Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The structural similarity of the subunits has enabled the creation of a series of enzymatically active chimeric polypeptides and has allowed us to attribute the functional differences of the subunits to discrete polypeptide segments. Only the α-subunit active site, expressed in β-hexosaminidase A and S, can effectively degrade sulfated substrates exemplified by MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4. Although exhibiting a similar specificity (5Kytzia H.-J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7568-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it should be pointed out that there may be some differences between the α-subunit active site in the homodimer, β-hexosaminidase S, and the α-subunit active site in the context of the heterodimer, β-hexosaminidase A. The chimeric subunit, αβ1, with the 191 amino-terminal amino acids of the α-subunit linked to the carboxyl-terminal 332 amino acids of the β-subunit showed activity against the MU-GlcNAc but not the MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 substrate. Other bipartite chimeras were either totally inactive or only active with the MU-GlcNAc substrate. However, when the 127 carboxyl-terminal amino acids as well as the 191 amino-terminal amino acids of the α-subunit were included to produce the tripartite construct, αβα1, significant activity against the MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 substrate was observed. Both α-subunit termini (amino acids 1-191 and 403-529) were required for activity against the sulfated substrate because βα1, which contained the same carboxyl-terminal α-sequence as αβα1 but without the amino-terminal α-sequence, was inactive. The requirement for two discontinuous stretches of α-sequence for MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 activity is reminiscent of the cathepsin D/pepsinogen chimeras described by Kornfeld and co-workers (17Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that required two different regions of cathepsin D for effective phosphorylation of its mannose residues. In this case, these two noncontinuous amino acid sequences of cathepsin D were contiguous in the three-dimensional structure forming a compact protein recognition domain. Therefore, it is possible that in the three dimensional structure of the α-subunit, the amino and carboxyl termini form a portion of the active site for MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 such that amino acid residues from one or both of these regions are involved in the binding and/or hydrolysis of the substrate. Alternatively, residues from these regions may not be directly involved with the substrate but may contribute to the structure of the active site indirectly by influencing the folding and overall conformation of the subunit. In light of the difference in specificity of the subunits, it is interesting the amino and carboxyl termini contain the most differences in amino acid sequence between subunits (Fig. 1). Clearly, a three-dimensional structure of β-hexosaminidase, when available, will greatly facilitate the interpretation of these results. Although the active sites on β-hexosaminidase subunits have been well characterized kinetically (5Kytzia H.-J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7568-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is only minimal information concerning their structure. Recently, however, Glu-355 in the β-subunit was photoaffinity labeled with an active site-directed inhibitor implicating Glu-355 and the amino acids in the immediate vicinity as binding or active site residues (Fig. 1) (18Liessem B.

This evolutionarily conserved area (Fig. 1) may be involved in a catalytic mechanism shared between the α- and β-subunits and other hexosaminidases (18Liessem B. Glombitza G.J. Knoll F. Lehmann J. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23693-23699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), so it is not surprising that the region is excluded from the segments that confer MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 specificity, a unique property of the α-subunit. A second amino acid implicated in the catalytic activity of β-hexosaminidase is Arg-178 of the α-subunit, the residue mutated in the B1-variant of Tay-Sachs disease (19Suzuki K. Vanier M.T. Dev. Neurosci. 1991; 13: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Brown C.A. Mahuran D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15855-15862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the corresponding amino acid in the β-subunit impairs catalytic activity again, suggesting a shared function of the this residue between subunits. Clearly Arg-178 and surrounding residues alone are not sufficient for MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 activity because chimera αβ1, which contains the amino-terminal 191 amino acids of the α-subunit, is only active against MU-GlcNAc. The degradation of GM2 ganglioside by β-hexosaminidase A requires the GM2 activator protein (reviewed in 6Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The activator binds the ganglioside in a 1:1 complex and the complex interacts directly with the enzyme allowing the α-subunit active site to remove the terminal GalNAc moiety from the tetrasaccharide moiety of GM2 ganglioside. The α-subunit possesses a binding site for the activator-ganglioside complex. However, the β-subunit must also contribute to this interaction, because only β-hexosaminidase A of the three isozymes can carry out the reaction at physiological rates. We found that neither chimeric subunits αβ1 nor αβα1, when expressed alone, demonstrated activator-dependent ganglioside degradation activity. In this regard, they were no more effective than the wild-type subunits expressed singly. However, when these chimeric subunits were expressed in combination with each wild-type subunit, we found that αβ1 together with the α-subunit caused the activator-dependent degradation of the ganglioside about as well as the co-expression of the wild-type α- and β-subunits. This result shows that the specific function of the β-subunit in activator-dependent ganglioside degradation resides in the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the precursor polypeptide (amino acids 225-556). The result also indicates that the amino-terminal one-third (amino acids 1-224) does not provide a β-subunit-specific function because it can be replaced by the corresponding segment from the α-subunit. In addition, the chimeric enzymes also shed some light on the important regions of the α-subunit in activator-dependent ganglioside degradation. The inability of αβα1 to substitute for the α-subunit in a heterodimer with the β-subunit indicates that amino acids 192-402 of the α-subunit, which are missing from αβα1, impart an essential function for ganglioside hydrolysis. We have established a structure-function relationship of discrete regions of the β-hexosaminidase subunits with the ability to degrade particular substrates. By substituting smaller segments into these chimeras and through site-directed mutagenesis within these regions, it should be possible to define individual residues that participate in determining the specificity of the hexosaminidase isozymes. Ultimately, a complete understanding of the interaction of various substrates with β-hexosaminidase will require a combination of approaches including chimera analysis and affinity labeling together with a three-dimensional structure of the enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2091759604,"To determine the role of a neutral and basic amino acid transporter (NBAT) in amino acid transport, we microinjected several COOH-terminal deletion mutants of NBAT cRNA into Xenopus oocytes and measured transport activity for arginine, leucine, and cystine in the presence and absence of sodium. Wild-type NBAT significantly stimulated the uptake of all three amino acids 10-20-fold compared with controls. On the other hand, no mutant, except a Δ511-685 mutant, stimulated the uptake of these amino acids. The Δ511-685 mutant significantly increased the uptake of arginine. In the presence of sodium, the Δ511-685 mutant also increased the uptake of leucine. The Δ511-685 mutant did not stimulate cystine uptake in the presence or absence of sodium. The stimulation of arginine uptake by the Δ511-685 mutant was inhibited by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled leucine in the presence of sodium. Inhibition of L-arginine uptake by L-homoserine was seen only in the presence of sodium, and an increase in the inhibition of L-arginine uptake by L-histidine was seen when the extracellular pH was decreased. Furthermore, an inward current in oocytes injected with the Δ511-685 mutant was recorded electrophysiologically when basic amino acids were applied. Homoserine was also taken up, but sodium was necessary for their transport. These properties of the Δ511-685 mutant correspond to those of the y+ amino acid transporter. If NBAT is a component of the b0,+-like amino acid transport system, it is unlikely that a mutant protein (Δ511-685) is able to stimulate an endogenous y+-like transport system. These results suggest that NBAT functions as a activator of the amino acid transport system in Xenopus oocytes."

We found a discordance in the expected co-expression of MBD and GGT; as expected, MBD and GGT are both expressed at high levels in the kidney and small intestine. However, in the lung, MBD is expressed at high levels, whereas GGT is almost undetectable. The reverse is true in the seminal vesicles and fetal liver. Thus, although both enzymes may function in concert to metabolize glutathione in kidney and small intestine, in other tissues they appear to act independently, suggesting that they have independent roles in other biological processes.

Keida Y. Konta Y. Maeda M. Matsumoto Y. Niwa M. Kohsaka M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and is present in coding exon 5 (this paper). Because of the potential therapeutic importance of β-lactam antibiotics, most of these efforts appear to have been directed toward understanding the structure-function relationship and the development of better inhibitors of MBD (16Adachi H. Katayama T. Nakazato H. Tsujimoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Hikida M. Kawashima K. Nishiki K. Furukawa Y. Nishizawa K. Saito I.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).In contrast, other functions of MBD have been less extensively studied (19Curthoys N.P. Vina J. Glutathione Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 217Google Scholar, 20Turner A.J. Turner A.J. Molecular and Cell Biology of Membrane Proteins. Ellis Harwood, New York1990: 129Google Scholar). In view of the importance of MBD in the γ-glutamyl cycle and in the metabolism of leukotrienes and xenobiotics, more information about non-antibiotic aspects of MBD would be welcome. As a first step in the analysis of the regulation of MBD expression and its role in mammalian physiology, we have studied MBD expression in the mouse. We have examined tissue-specific steady-state MBD RNA levels on a comparative basis with GGT, identified four distinct MBD RNA species, and demonstrated that they are encoded by a single MBD gene.DISCUSSIONWe have investigated the expression of MBD in the mouse and found that steady state RNA levels are highest in the small intestine, kidney, and lung. At least four different types of RNA are expressed, and these are generated by a combination of the use of two different promoters and two different poly(A) addition sites. Because we have found that a significant portion (∼40-50%) of lung MBD RNA is not protected in nuclease protection assays by probes specific for type I or type II MBD RNA (Fig. 4C), additional MBD RNAs must exist. It is not clear at present whether these are generated by the use of other promoters or alternative splicing or both. All tissues examined use both poly(A) addition sites but with different frequencies (Fig. 1A), and in kidney at least, all four types of MBD RNA have been identified (Fig. 7). It seems likely that the MBD like GGT and other genes may utilize transcription from different promoters as a strategy to achieve unique patterns of tissue-specific expression (5Lieberman M.W. Barrios R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Rajagopalan S. Sepulveda A.R. Shi Z.-Z. Wan D.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1175-1185PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M.

It appears that the MBD gene uses these different 5′- and 3′-ends to achieve fine adjustments in mRNA levels, depending on the physiological requirements of each tissue. Whether this heterogeneity of expression has biological importance is not clear.Mouse MBD is a single copy gene consisting of 11 exons and is similar in structure to the human gene (15Satoh S. Kusunoki C. Konta Y. Niwa M. Kohsaka M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using the nomenclature established for human MBD RNA (15Satoh S. Kusunoki C. Konta Y. Niwa M. Kohsaka M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), type I RNA is derived from exon 1. Type II RNA has its origin ∼6 kb 5′ of this region in an exon that we have designated −1 (Fig. 6). Type II transcripts are spliced at a site 3′ of the origin of type I RNA and common to both types I and II RNA (Fig. 6).Because MBD acts in concert with GGT to cleave GSH into its component amino acids, we evaluated the coexpression of these two genes. In tissues like kidney and small intestine, where significant extracellular GSH degradation occurs, not surprisingly, we have found high expression of both genes (Fig. 1). However, the cellular distribution of MBD and GGT are somewhat different in the kidney (Fig. 2, A and B); while both are expressed in the proximal convoluted tubules, MBD is also expressed in some cortical collecting duct epithelial cells. Although the reason for expression there is unclear, it implies that MBD and GGT function are not always tightly coupled. Additional evidence for this formulation comes from evaluation of expression in lung and seminal vesicles. Small intestine and kidney have high steady state levels of both MBD and GGT RNAs; in contrast, we could not detect GGT expression in mouse lung by Northern analysis or in histochemistry. We know that lung expresses low levels of GGT (∼0.3% of kidney levels) from other studies. 3B. Z. Carter, A. L. Wiseman, R. Orkiszewski, K. Ballard, J. E. Shields, Y. Will, D. J. Reed, C.-N. Ou, and M. W. Lieberman, submitted for publication. 4M. W. Lieberman and A. L. Wiseman, unpublished results. Thus, in lung, MBD appears to function independently of GGT, but its role in lung physiology is at present unclear. Its expression in bronchiolar epithelial cells and Clara cells may indicate its involvement in the detoxification of xenobiotics or leukotriene metabolism in the lung.The reverse situation occurs in seminal vesicle, where GGT is clearly expressed in luminal epithelial cells2 (Fig. 2, E and F), but MBD expression is not detectable. This observation raises the question of whether seminal fluid has high levels of cysteinyl glycine (generated by the action of GGT on GSH) or some other dipeptidase cleaves this dipeptide there. Similarly, fetal liver expresses GGT (Fig. 1; 24Habib G.M. Carter B.Z. Sepulveda A.R. Shi Z.-Z. Wan D.-F. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13711-13715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); however, we were unable to detect MBD in this tissue. These observations underscore the discordance of MBD and GGT expression.It is likely that MBD plays multiple roles in biological processes. Its main function in kidney may be the recycling of GSH in conjunction with GGT, while in the intestine it may participate in similar recycling and also play a role in the catabolism of dietary proteins. It is likely that MBD may be involved in the metabolism of eicosanoids, including leukotriene D4. Thus, relative tissue levels of leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4, and the renal and gastrointestinal clearance of these compounds, may be regulated by the relative activities of MBD, GGT, and a leukotrienase that we have recently described.3 In this regard, the absence of MBD in tissues in which GSH metabolism and/or eicosanoid activity is high may tell us as much about the function of this enzyme as its presence.

Turner A.J. Mammalian Ectoenzymes. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1987: 329Google Scholar). MBD has also been implicated in the degradation of glutathione. Following removal of a γ-glutamyl group by γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT; EC), MBD is thought to cleave cystinyl bisglycine to its component amino acids. Thus, the sequential action of these two enzymes is believed to be essential in the recycling of GSH via the γ-glutamyl cycle (4Meister A. Larsson A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

The metabolism of peptidyl leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and the transport of cysteine and perhaps other amino acids are other biological processes in which MBD participates (5Lieberman M.W.

The complete primary sequence of MBD has been elucidated for a variety of mammalian species by cDNA cloning (12Satoh S. Keida Y. Konta Y. Maeda M. Matsumoto Y. Niwa M. Kohsaka M. Biochim. Biophys.

The human MBD gene has been cloned and found to span about 6 kb and consists of nine coding exons (15Satoh S. Kusunoki C. Konta Y. Niwa M. Kohsaka M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recently, Adachi et al. (16Adachi H. Katayama T. Nakazato H. Tsujimoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) demonstrated the importance of Glu-125 in the catalytic activity of human MBD, and this residue is also conserved in mouse MBD (12Satoh S.

Because of the potential therapeutic importance of β-lactam antibiotics, most of these efforts appear to have been directed toward understanding the structure-function relationship and the development of better inhibitors of MBD (16Adachi H. Katayama T. Nakazato H. Tsujimoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Hikida M. Kawashima K. Nishiki K. Furukawa Y. Nishizawa K. Saito I.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, other functions of MBD have been less extensively studied (19Curthoys N.P. Vina J. Glutathione Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 217Google Scholar, 20Turner A.J. Turner A.J. Molecular and Cell Biology of Membrane Proteins. Ellis Harwood, New York1990: 129Google Scholar). In view of the importance of MBD in the γ-glutamyl cycle and in the metabolism of leukotrienes and xenobiotics, more information about non-antibiotic aspects of MBD would be welcome. As a first step in the analysis of the regulation of MBD expression and its role in mammalian physiology, we have studied MBD expression in the mouse. We have examined tissue-specific steady-state MBD RNA levels on a comparative basis with GGT, identified four distinct MBD RNA species, and demonstrated that they are encoded by a single MBD gene. DISCUSSIONWe have investigated the expression of MBD in the mouse and found that steady state RNA levels are highest in the small intestine, kidney, and lung. At least four different types of RNA are expressed, and these are generated by a combination of the use of two different promoters and two different poly(A) addition sites. Because we have found that a significant portion (∼40-50%) of lung MBD RNA is not protected in nuclease protection assays by probes specific for type I or type II MBD RNA (Fig. 4C), additional MBD RNAs must exist. It is not clear at present whether these are generated by the use of other promoters or alternative splicing or both. All tissues examined use both poly(A) addition sites but with different frequencies (Fig. 1A), and in kidney at least, all four types of MBD RNA have been identified (Fig. 7). It seems likely that the MBD like GGT and other genes may utilize transcription from different promoters as a strategy to achieve unique patterns of tissue-specific expression (5Lieberman M.W. Barrios R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Rajagopalan S. Sepulveda A.R. Shi Z.-Z. Wan D.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1175-1185PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sepulveda A.R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M.

It appears that the MBD gene uses these different 5′- and 3′-ends to achieve fine adjustments in mRNA levels, depending on the physiological requirements of each tissue. Whether this heterogeneity of expression has biological importance is not clear.Mouse MBD is a single copy gene consisting of 11 exons and is similar in structure to the human gene (15Satoh S. Kusunoki C. Konta Y. Niwa M. Kohsaka M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using the nomenclature established for human MBD RNA (15Satoh S. Kusunoki C. Konta Y. Niwa M. Kohsaka M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), type I RNA is derived from exon 1. Type II RNA has its origin ∼6 kb 5′ of this region in an exon that we have designated −1 (Fig. 6). Type II transcripts are spliced at a site 3′ of the origin of type I RNA and common to both types I and II RNA (Fig. 6).Because MBD acts in concert with GGT to cleave GSH into its component amino acids, we evaluated the coexpression of these two genes. In tissues like kidney and small intestine, where significant extracellular GSH degradation occurs, not surprisingly, we have found high expression of both genes (Fig. 1). However, the cellular distribution of MBD and GGT are somewhat different in the kidney (Fig. 2, A and B); while both are expressed in the proximal convoluted tubules, MBD is also expressed in some cortical collecting duct epithelial cells. Although the reason for expression there is unclear, it implies that MBD and GGT function are not always tightly coupled. Additional evidence for this formulation comes from evaluation of expression in lung and seminal vesicles. Small intestine and kidney have high steady state levels of both MBD and GGT RNAs; in contrast, we could not detect GGT expression in mouse lung by Northern analysis or in histochemistry. We know that lung expresses low levels of GGT (∼0.3% of kidney levels) from other studies. 3B. Z. Carter, A. L. Wiseman, R. Orkiszewski, K. Ballard, J. E. Shields, Y. Will, D. J. Reed, C.-N. Ou, and M. W. Lieberman, submitted for publication. 4M. W. Lieberman and A. L. Wiseman, unpublished results. Thus, in lung, MBD appears to function independently of GGT, but its role in lung physiology is at present unclear. Its expression in bronchiolar epithelial cells and Clara cells may indicate its involvement in the detoxification of xenobiotics or leukotriene metabolism in the lung.The reverse situation occurs in seminal vesicle, where GGT is clearly expressed in luminal epithelial cells2 (Fig. 2, E and F), but MBD expression is not detectable. This observation raises the question of whether seminal fluid has high levels of cysteinyl glycine (generated by the action of GGT on GSH) or some other dipeptidase cleaves this dipeptide there. Similarly, fetal liver expresses GGT (Fig. 1; 24Habib G.M. Carter B.Z. Sepulveda A.R. Shi Z.-Z. Wan D.-F. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13711-13715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); however, we were unable to detect MBD in this tissue. These observations underscore the discordance of MBD and GGT expression.It is likely that MBD plays multiple roles in biological processes. Its main function in kidney may be the recycling of GSH in conjunction with GGT, while in the intestine it may participate in similar recycling and also play a role in the catabolism of dietary proteins. It is likely that MBD may be involved in the metabolism of eicosanoids, including leukotriene D4. Thus, relative tissue levels of leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4, and the renal and gastrointestinal clearance of these compounds, may be regulated by the relative activities of MBD, GGT, and a leukotrienase that we have recently described.3 In this regard, the absence of MBD in tissues in which GSH metabolism and/or eicosanoid activity is high may tell us as much about the function of this enzyme as its presence.

In the absence of thyroxine (T4), p29 is slowly endocytosed and transported to the lysosomes. T4 treatment rapidly activates an actin-mediated endocytotic pathway and targets the enzyme to the endosomes. In this study, we have characterized the influence of T4 on the intracellular trafficking of 5′D-II. We show that T4 accelerates the rate of 5′D-II inactivation by translocating the enzyme to the interior of the cell and by sequestering p29 in the endosomal pool without accelerating the rate of degradation of p29. This dichotomy between the rapid inactivation of catalytic activity and the much slower degradation of p29 is consistent with the reuse of p29 in the production of 5′D-II activity. Immunocytochemical analysis with a specific anti-p29 IgG shows that pulse affinity-labeled p29 reappears on the plasma membrane ∼2 h after enzyme internalization in the presence of T4, indicating that p29 is recycled. Despite the ability of p29 to be recycled in the T4-treated cell, 5′D-II catalytic activity requires ongoing protein synthesis, presumably of another enzyme component(s) or an accessory enzyme-related protein. In the absence of T4, enzyme inactivation and p29 degradation are temporally linked, and pulse affinity-labeled p29 is internalized and sequestered in discrete intracellular pools. These data suggest that T4 regulates fundamental processes involved with the turnover of integral membrane proteins and participates in regulating the inter-relationships between the degradation, recycling, and synthetic pathways.

In the absence of T4, enzyme levels are high, and 5′D-II inactivation is slow. T4 promotes interactions between the enzyme and the F-actin microfilaments that lead to 5′D-II inactivation and enzyme internalization, resulting in a rapid fall in enzyme levels (6Leonard J.L.

The 29-kDa substrate-binding subunit (p29) of 5′D-II is covalently modified by the alkylating affinity label N-bromoacetyl-L-T4 (BrAcT4), allowing the enzyme to be identified without measuring catalytic activity (10Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing cultured astrocytes that retain all of the 5′D-II regulatory aspects seen in the brain in vivo and that express high levels of 5′D-II activity in the presence of cyclic AMP (11Leonard J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we have previously shown that T4 dynamically regulates 5′D-II levels by directing the enzyme to use different pathways of internalization (8Farwell A.P. Dibenedetto D.J. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under T4-deficient conditions, p29 is internalized via the traditional endocytotic pathway and is slowly transported through the endosomes to the lysosomes. In contrast, T4 treatment activates specific protein-F-actin interactions involved in actin-mediated endocytosis and targets the enzyme to the endosomes, where the internalized 5′D-II-containing vesicle remains without subsequent transit to the lysosomes. Recycling of the catalytically active enzyme back to the plasma membrane has not been observed in the short time frames examined previously; thus, the fate of the endosomal pool of internalized 5′D-II remains uncertain in the presence of T4. The endosomes are a collection of vesicles located in the perinuclear space (12Helenius A. Mellman I. Wall D. Hubbard A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 245-249Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 13Mueller S.C. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 932-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Vesicles internalized via endocytosis initially exist as early endosomes and contain a mixture of polypeptides with differing fates. Vesicles containing proteins to be recycled, such as the transferrin and insulin receptors, are directed back to the plasma membrane (14Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Lodish H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9681-9689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while vesicles containing proteins destined for degradation evolve into late endosomes and are targeted to the lysosomes. In the secretory pathway, vesicles containing newly synthesized membrane proteins pass from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi stack before exiting through the trans-Golgi network, where they are targeted to the plasma membrane directly or routed through the endosomes (15Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 16Rothman J. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). From the endosomes, the secretory vesicles may be directed to the plasma membrane, to the lysosomes, or to vesicle storage pools. The sorting mechanism that determines the destination of the differing vesicles that compose the endosomes is still unclear (17Pryer N.K. Wuestehube L.J. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 61: 471-516Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The T4-dependent regulation of the pathways of 5′D-II inactivation/internalization suggests a role for hormonal regulation in vesicle-mediated protein transport (8Farwell A.P. Dibenedetto D.J. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that 1) the rate of degradation of the 29-kDa substrate-binding subunit of 5′D-II (p29) is unaffected by T4; 2) in the presence of T4, p29 is recycled back to its site of action on the plasma membrane; and 3) despite recycling of p29, 5′D-II catalytic activity requires de novo synthesis of additional enzyme components. Since T4 determines whether p29 is recycled back to the plasma membrane or is routed to the lysosomes, these data suggest that, in addition to regulating the internalization pathway of 5′D-II, T4 participates in regulating the inter-relationships between the degradation, recycling, and synthetic pathways. Pregnant (16–17-day gestation) rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Kingston, NY). T4 and BSA was purchased from Sigma. T3 was obtained from Henning GmbH, and dihydrocytochalasin B was obtained from Calbiochem. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), antibiotics, Hanks' solution, and 0.25% trypsin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and defined bovine calf serum (heat-inactivated) was from Hyclone Laboratories. Culture flasks were obtained from Nunc, and 24-well tissue culture plates were obtained from Falcon. All other reagents used were of the highest purity commercially available. Rat type I astrocyte cultures were obtained by enzymatic dispersion of neonatal rat brains as described previously (18McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1978; 4: 15-26PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37°C in DMEM supplemented with 15 mM sodium bicarbonate, 33 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, with 10% (v/v) calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 90 µg/ml streptomycin. The culture medium was changed three times weekly, and cells were subcultured (2–3 × 104 cells/cm2) when they reached confluence (7–10 days). Confluent cells from passages 2–4, containing >95% astrocytes as determined by staining for the astrocyte-specific protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (19McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar), were utilized for experiments. Steady-state levels of 5′D-II were induced by incubating the cells for 8 h in a defined medium consisting of DMEM and 0.1% BSA ± thyroid hormone, followed by a 16-h stimulation with 1 mM Bt2cAMP and 100 nM hydrocortisone. Cells were harvested by scraping in ice-cold 8 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2.7 mM KCl and 137 mM NaCl and collected by centrifugation. 5′D-II activity was determined in cell sonicates by the iodide release method at 2 nM rT3 and 20 mM dithiothreitol in the presence of 1 mM propylthiouracil. Units are expressed as femtomoles of I− released per hour. The turnover of 5′D-II was determined by assaying enzyme activity 5–60 min after inhibition of protein synthesis with 100 µM cycloheximide in 50 mM HEPES and 1 mg/ml BSA in buffered Hanks' solution, pH 7.0, in the presence or absence of 10 nM T4. The turnover of 5′D-II in the presence of BFA was determined by preincubating cells with 5 µg/ml BFA for 15 min before the addition of 100 µM cycloheximide. Cells were then collected as described above and assayed for 5′D-II activity. The p29 polypeptide was affinity-labeled in confluent astrocytes expressing steady-state levels of 5′D-II in the absence of thyroid hormone by incubation for 20 min with either 0.4 or 10 nM BrAc[125I]T4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 mM HEPES in buffered Hanks' solution, pH 7.0. The labeling medium was removed, and the cells were washed free of unbound affinity label and then chased for 30–120 min with either 10 nM T4 or T3 or with no hormone in 50 mM HEPES and 1 mg/ml BSA in buffered Hanks' solution, pH 7.0. Cells were collected and sonicated. Affinity-labeled proteins were identified after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The quantity of p29 was determined by scanning densitometry. Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips (22 × 22 mm) coated with poly-D-lysine (10 µg/ml) and grown for 24 h. 5′D-II activity was induced as described above. Cells were affinity-labeled for 20 min with 10 nM BrAcT4 in buffered Hanks' solution containing 10 mM dithiothreitol and 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, and washed and chased for 0–120 min in DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM Bt2cAMP, and 100 nM hydrocortisone in the presence and absence of 10 nM T4. All cells were treated with 10 µM colchicine to relax the cell borders for 60 min prior to fixation. Cells were fixed in iced 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with iced methanol. 5′D-II was identified by incubation with an antiserum raised against p29 (see accompanying paper (31Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 16363-16368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) or with an anti-T4 IgG that recognizes the BrAcT4 moiety, and immune complexes were identified by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Coverslips were then mounted and examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy with a depth of resolution of 0.5 µm. Where indicated, results were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test. The 29-kDa substrate-binding subunit of 5′D-II (p29) is selectively affinity-labeled by BrAcT4 (4Safran M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3233-3238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of T4, p29 is internalized and targeted to the lysosomes, whereas in the presence of T4, p29 remains indefinitely in the endosomal pool localized in the perinuclear space of the cell (7Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Farwell A.P. Dibenedetto D.J. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the different metabolic fates of proteins residing in these two intracellular compartments, we examined the effect of thyroid hormone on the degradation of p29. Cells were grown in thyroid hormone-free medium and stimulated with Bt2cAMP and hydrocortisone to express high levels of 5′D-II (11Leonard J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). P29 was affinity-labeled, and cells were then chased with either 10 nM T4 or T3 or with no hormone for up to 90 min. The cellular content of p29 and the levels of catalytically active 5′D-II were analyzed at 0–90 min after the addition of hormone. As shown in Fig. 1A, the disappearance of p29 over time was unaffected by thyroid hormone, while >80% of the catalytic activity of 5′D-II was lost due to the presence of T4 (Fig. 1B). Little or no other smaller affinity-labeled degradation products from the affinity-labeled p29 protein were observed over this time frame (data not shown). Shown in Table I are the steady-state levels of p29 in cells grown in the presence and absence of T4. As reported previously, the quantity of BrAcT4-labeled p29 (labeled at a concentration of 0.4 nM BrAcT4) (see accompanying paper (31Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 16363-16368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) in T4-deficient cells was ∼2-fold greater than that in T4-treated astrocytes. In contrast, 5′D-II activity in T4-deficient cells was ∼10-fold higher than that in T4-treated astrocytes (Table I) (6Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy between the p29 content and 5′D-II activity levels is likely to be due to different quantification techniques for catalytic activity and p29 (10Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the ability of BrAcT4 to label the p29 subunit of catalytically inactive 5′D-II (see accompanying paper (31Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 16363-16368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). Since T4 has no effect on the fractional disappearance rate of p29 (Fig. 1A), the calculated appearance rate of this polypeptide in the presence of T4 is approximately half that seen in the absence of hormone (Table I). As shown previously (6Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the production rate of catalytic activity is unaffected by thyroid hormone (Table I). Thus, the production and disposal of the p29 substrate-binding subunit of 5′D-II differ from the production and disposal of 5′D-II catalytic activity.Table IEffect of thyroid hormone on the half-life of p29 and 5′D-II in astrocytes10 nM T4Thyroid hormone-deficientp29 contentSteady-state levels (OD/mg protein)17.735.1t1/2 (h−1)1.71.5Appearance rate (h−1)7.316.25′D-II activitySteady-state levels (units/mg protein)2002177t1/2 (h−1)0.22.2Production rate (h−1)692718 Open table in a new tab The differences between the effects of T4 on the respective t1/2 values of p29 and 5′D-II catalytic activity, our observation that p29 accumulates in the endosomal pool in the presence of T4 (8Farwell A.P. Dibenedetto D.J. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the observation that p29 is found in the endosomal pool in catalytically inactive astrocytes (see accompanying paper (31Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 16363-16368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) raise the possibility that this multimeric enzyme is recycled. To examine this possibility, recycling of 5′D-II activity was determined in protein synthesis-blocked cells kept for extended periods of time. Cells expressing 5′D-II activity in T4-replete medium were incubated in the presence and absence of 100 µM cycloheximide for up to 4 h, and 5′D-II activity was assayed. As shown in Fig. 2, 5′D-II activity fell to undetectable levels in cycloheximide-blocked cells, with little or no recovery of catalytic activity observed at any time point. Cell viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, was unaffected over the 4-h treatment period with cycloheximide (data not shown). Enzyme levels remained constant in the presence of continued protein synthesis. Thus, the maintenance of 5′D-II catalytic activity in astrocytes requires ongoing protein synthesis. BFA is a fungal toxin that dramatically alters vesicle trafficking within the cell, causing fusion of the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum/endosomal organelles and blocking transport of vesicle proteins to the lysosomes (20Klausner R.D. Finaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar, 21Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24829-24833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to a functional separation of the secretory, recycling, and degradative pathways and also promotes membrane protein recycling (20Klausner R.D. Finaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar, 21Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). For example, BFA increases the accumulation of the receptors for insulin-like growth factor II and insulin on the plasma membrane, two receptors that are recycled through the endosomes in fibroblasts (22Damke H. Klumperman J. von Figura K. Braulkes T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24829-24833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if 5′D-II activity could be recycled from the endosomes in astrocytes, we used BFA to maximize transit through the membrane protein recycling pathways. As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of BFA to cycloheximide-blocked, T4-replete cells had no effect on the fall of 5′D-II activity. In the absence of BFA, there was little or no recovery of catalytic activity observed at any time point. Next, we examined the effects of BFA on steady-state levels of 5′D-II in the presence of continued protein synthesis (Fig. 3). BFA had no effect on steady-state levels in T4-replete cells during treatment periods up to 60 min. In contrast, BFA treatment led to a steady increase in 5′D-II activity in T4-deficient cells, resulting in a doubling of enzyme activity by 60 min. Analysis of the disappearance kinetics of 5′D-II revealed that BFA prolonged the biological half-life of the catalytically active enzyme in both T4-deficient (t1/2 = 2.1 versus 3.0 h−1) (Fig. 4A) and T4-replete (t1/2 = 0.2 versus 0.3 h−1) (Fig. 4B) astrocytes. Since the biological half-life of 5′D-II activity in T4-replete cells was prolonged in the presence of BFA and the levels of enzyme remained unchanged, BFA treatment must cause a proportional fall in enzyme production. 5′D-II generation in T4-deficient cells was minimally affected by BFA, as there was a concordant increase in both t1/2 and enzyme levels. These data imply that the sources of the catalytically active holoenzyme are different in cells grown in the presence and absence of T4.Fig. 4Effect of brefeldin A on the turnover of 5′D-II activity in astrocytes. Steady-state levels of 5′D-II activity were induced in confluent astrocytes incubated in either the presence or absence of 10 nM T4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were incubated in the presence (○) or absence (•) of BFA (5 µg/ml) for 15 min, and then protein synthesis was blocked by the addition of 100 µM cycloheximide. 5′D-II activity was assayed at increasing times after the addition of cycloheximide. Results are expressed as a percent of the starting 5′D-II activity (femtomoles of I− released per milligram of protein/hour) at the time of addition of cycloheximide and represent the means of triplicate values in at least two experiment. A, cells incubated in the absence of thyroid hormone; B, cells incubated in the presence of 10 nM T4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One explanation for these differential effects of BFA on 5′D-II activity is that one or more of the enzyme-associated polypeptides are recycled in cells grown in the presence of T4. Thus, in T4-treated cells where 5′D-II is rapidly internalized to the endosomes (7Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Farwell A.P. Dibenedetto D.J. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), BFA treatment should prevent the recycling enzyme polypeptide(s) from joining the de novo enzyme production pathway, leading to an accumulation of inactive enzyme precursors in the fused vesicle pool and thereby decreasing the observed enzyme production rate. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effects of BFA on the accumulation of catalytically active 5′D-II after depolymerization of the F-actin cytoskeleton in T4-treated astrocytes. Depolymerization of F-actin by dihydrocytochalasin B blocks T4-mediated endocytosis and results in the accumulation of 5′D-II activity at a rate equal to the production rate of enzyme catalytic activity (6Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An accelerated rate of accumulation of catalytic activity is expected if a pool of enzyme precursors is formed in the presence of BFA. As shown in Fig. 5, the addition of dihydrocytochalasin B to T4-replete astrocytes caused the steady accumulation of 5′D-II activity as reported previously (6Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreating the T4-replete cells with BFA increased the initial rate of enzyme accumulation by ∼2-fold in dihydrocytochalasin B-blocked cells. This effect was transient in cells pretreated for only 30 min with BFA, while a 60-min pretreatment period led to a sustained increase in the rate of 5′D-II activity accumulation. These data suggest that BFA treatment results in an increase in the storage of enzyme-related polypeptides in an intracellular pool. Direct examination of the intracellular transit of the enzyme polypeptide(s) was performed by using a specific IgG directed against the affinity-labeled 29-kDa substrate-binding subunit of 5′D-II (anti-p29 IgG) (see accompanying paper (31Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 16363-16368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). T4-deficient astrocytes were grown on glass coverslips, pulse affinity-labeled with BrAcT4, and then chased with either 10 nMT4 or no hormone. Cells were fixed after increasing periods of time, stained with anti-p29 IgG, and examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 6A (arrows), punctate staining is present in a “rim” pattern at the periphery of the cell in the thyroid hormone-deficient, affinity-labeled astrocyte, while the interior of the cell is largely devoid of immunoreactive staining. This rim pattern is consistent with a plasma membrane location for the staining. After a 20-min treatment with T4, the majority of the staining is located in the perinuclear space within the cell (Fig. 6B, P), with little immunoreactive staining remaining on the plasma membrane (arrows). These patterns are consistent with previous studies done with an anti-T4 IgG that show that affinity-labeled polypeptide(s), predominantly p29, are located on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane in the thyroid hormone-deficient cell and are translocated to the perinuclear space within 20 min of exposure to T4 (7Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, previous studies have shown that the majority of affinity-labeled p29 after short-term exposure (20 min) to T4 resides in the endosomal pool (8Farwell A.P. Dibenedetto D.J. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a 2-h exposure to T4, prominent punctate staining is again found at the periphery of the cell in a rim pattern (Fig. 6C, white arrows), along with clusters of staining present diffusely throughout the cell (black arrow). Since anti-p29 IgG selectively recognizes affinity-labeled p29 (see accompanying paper (31Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 16363-16368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar)), these data show that pulse-labeled p29 was internalized and recycled back to the plasma membrane in T4-treated astrocytes. In contrast to the T4-treated cells, immunoreactive staining in the T4-deficient cell is clustered into discrete regions within the cell (Fig. 6D, black arrow), with little staining remaining on the plasma membrane (white arrows). Previous studies have shown that affinity-labeled p29 is transported from the plasma membrane to discrete intracellular pools identified as lysosomes in T4-deficient cells (8Farwell A.P. Dibenedetto D.J. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of BFA on the recycling of pulse-labeled p29 are shown in Fig. 7. Pulse-labeled p29 was identified with an anti-T4 IgG that recognizes the BrAcT4-labeled enzyme as described previously (7Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Punctate staining in a rim pattern is present in the cells treated with T4 for 2 h, indicating a plasma membrane location (Fig. 7, upper left panel, arrows). This pattern is identical to the pattern observed in Fig. 6C using anti-p29 IgG and is again consistent with the recycling of p29 back to the plasma membrane. Treatment with BFA blocked the reappearance of p29 on the plasma membrane in the presence of T4 since the immunofluorescence remains in clusters within the cell and rim staining is not present (Fig. 7, upper right panel). In the absence of T4, the immunoreactive staining is predominantly clustered within the cell at 2 h, with little effect of BFA observed on the distribution of immunofluorescence (Fig. 7, lower panels). In this study, we have characterized the intracellular trafficking of 5′D-II in cAMP-stimulated astrocytes and have shown that T4 regulates fundamental processes involved in the turnover of integral membrane proteins. Specifically, T4 shuttles plasma membrane proteins to the endosomes by switching from an actin-independent to an actin-mediated internalization pathway. Once in the endosomes, T4 modulates the sorting mechanism to select recycling pathways over degradation pathways. Thus, T4 participates in regulating the inter-relationships between the degradation, recycling, and synthetic pathways. The evidence the T4 shifts 5′D-II to a recycling pathway is 3-fold. First, there is a dichotomy between the rapid inactivation of catalytic activity and the much slower degradation of the 29-kDa substrate-binding subunit (p29) in euthyroid cells, consistent with the reuse of this protein in the production of catalytically active 5′D-II. Second, there is an increased rate of accumulation of 5′D-II activity in brefeldin A-treated euthyroid cells after depolymerization of the F-actin microfilaments, consistent with the storage of enzyme-related polypeptides in an intracellular pool that is available to the synthetic pathway. Finally, using anti-p29 antisera, pulse-labeled p29 reappears on the plasma membrane ∼2 h after internalization in the presence of T4. In contrast, the 5′D-II-containing vesicles in T4-deficient cells are sorted through the endosomes to the degradation pathway, ending up in the lysosomes (8Farwell A.P. Dibenedetto D.J. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme inactivation parallels p29 degradation in the absence of T4. Interestingly, the degradation rate of p29 is similar whether it is sorted directly to the lysosomes in the absence of T4 or is routed through one or more recycling sequences in the presence of T4. Since 5′D-II is a multimeric enzyme, there are two possibilities for recycling of this subunit. First, the holoenzyme may remain intact waiting for the synthesis of an accessory protein that either targets the enzyme to the plasma membrane or activates catalytic activity once it arrives at the plasma membrane. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that p29 in catalytically inactive astrocytes is part of a 180–200-kDa complex found in the endosomes (see accompanying paper (31Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 16363-16368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). Cyclic AMP induces the transcription of a 5′D-II “activating factor,” leading to the translocation of 5′D-II to the plasma membrane, activation of catalytic activity, and an increase in the apparent molecular mass of 5′D-II to the 200–220-kDa range. Alternatively, the holoenzyme may be disassembled, with one or more subunits shuttled to the lysosomes and p29 combining with other newly synthesized subunits. At least one component of the catalytically active enzyme requires de novo synthesis since ongoing protein synthesis is required to maintain catalytic activity. It is likely that this latter component is the cAMP-inducible activating factor. Previous work on the T4-dependent regulation of 5′D-II activity identified the inactivation/internalization pathway as the primary site of action of T4 (6Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Farwell A.P. Dibenedetto D.J. Leonard J.L. J. Biol.

Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14224-14229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, when measuring catalytic activity, T4 markedly increases the rate of inactivation of enzyme activity without affecting the production rate of 5′D-II activity (6Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, analysis of the effects of T4 on the turnover of the p29 subunit revealed a more complex production pathway for catalytically active 5′D-II. Brefeldin A, a fungal toxin that disconnects the secretory, recycling, and degradation pathways for membrane proteins, decreased both the production rate and inactivation rate of the catalytically active enzyme in euthyroid cells, but had little effect on the production rate in hypothyroid cells. These data indicate that the production of catalytically active 5′D-II differs in the presence and absence of T4. One possible explanation for this dichotomy is that the production of 5′D-II in the presence of T4 uses both de novo synthesis and preformed subunits recycled from the endosomes. In euthyroid astrocytes, we found that BFA prevented the return of 5′D-II to the plasma membrane and led to an accumulation of 5′D-II polypeptide(s) in intracellular membrane pools (Fig. 7). In contrast, in hypothyroid cells, all components of catalytically active 5′D-II are produced de novo, and BFA did not affect the production rate. Since at least one component of catalytically active 5′D-II needs to be newly synthesized in both cases, it appears that fusion of vesicles from the Golgi and endosomal pool as well as de novo synthesis of all 5′D-II subunits contribute to the production of active 5′D-II in euthyroid cells, while only the latter process contributes to production of active 5′D-II in hypothyroid cells. Thus, our initial finding that steady-state production rates of enzyme activity are unaffected by T4 (6Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the rate-limiting synthetic step is the same in the presence and absence of T4. Our current model of the regulatory events that modulate 5′D-II activity is shown in Fig. 8. The synthetic pathway includes the production of 5′D-II polypeptides and a putative activating factor that leads to translocation of the enzyme to the plasma membrane and activation of catalytic activity. This activating factor may be a component of 5′D-II itself or simply an accessory/chaperon protein. As shown in Fig. 8A, T4 initiates inactivation of 5′D-II, located on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane (7Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by promoting the binding of the enzyme to the F-actin cytoskeleton (6Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is then transported to the endosomes by an actin-mediated mechanism (7Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C.

From the endosomes, 5′D-II is shuttled back into the synthetic pathway, where it is recycled back to its active state on the plasma membrane. In hypothyroid cells or in cells treated with transcriptionally active T3, the 5′D-II polypeptide(s) are internalized by an actin-independent pathway (Fig. 8B) (6Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′D-II-containing vesicles are then sorted through the endosomes to the degradation pathway, ending up in the lysosomes (8Farwell A.P. Dibenedetto D.J. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The routing of vesicles through the endosomes to degradative, recycling, and synthetic pathways is regulated by targeting signals provided by vesicle-associated proteins located on the vesicle membrane. These vesicle proteins include regulatory coat proteins (17Pryer N.K. Wuestehube L.J. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 61: 471-516Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 20Klausner R.D.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 61: 471-516Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and proteins isolated primarily from synaptic vesicles, including the synapsins and the calcium-binding synaptotagmin (27Sudhof T.C. De Camilli P. Niermann H. Jahn R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28Sudhof T.C. Jahn R.

The binding of these proteins to, or removal from, vesicles results in the targeting of the vesicles to their ultimate destination. One potential mechanism by which T4 may regulate vesicle sorting is by binding to one of these regulatory proteins and thus modulating the targeting signals for the p29-containing vesicle. A potential candidate protein to be regulated by T4 is the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin, which participates in vesicle recycling in the nerve terminal (27Sudhof T.C. De Camilli P. Niermann H. Jahn R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Neuron. 1991; 6: 665-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In addition to promoting vesicle recycling, synaptotagmin also influences the morphology of the actin cytoskeleton (29Kelly R.B. Nature. 1993; 364: 487-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Feany M.B. Buckley K.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), two cellular events regulated by T4 in astrocytes. In summary, the regulation of 5′D-II activity in cultured astrocytes suggests that thyroid hormone regulates the basic mechanisms by which cells synthesize, degrade, and recycle proteins."

BiP, a stress-inducible chaperone protein, is implicated in protein folding and translocation in endoplasmic reticulum and induced in the condition of accumulation of unfolded proteins. Here, we examined the effect of Δ12-PGJ2 on the expression of the BiP gene. Δ12-PGJ2 markedly stimulated the expression of the BiP gene in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in HeLa cells. This stimulation was specific for cyclopentenone PGs among various PGs. Cycloheximide pretreatment completely inhibited the Δ12-PGJ2-induced expression of the BiP gene, suggesting that the effects on nascent protein synthesis are involved in the signaling mechanism. Δ12-PGJ2 markedly stimulated the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of the BiP gene through the unfolded protein response element. Furthermore, Δ12-PGJ2 stimulated the enhancer activity of the 3′-half of the unfolded protein response element, and this stimulation required three nucleotides within this region. Gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that this region was occupied with two specific nuclear protein factors with different mobilities in the control cells, and Δ12-PGJ2 induced the dissociation of the protein-DNA complex with lower mobility.

Eicosanoids are oxygenated metabolites of arachidonic acid and are regarded as modulators of cellular functions in various physiological and pathological processes (1Needleman P. Turk J. Jakschik B.A. Morrison A.R. Lefkowith J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 69-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eicosanoids are divided into two groups, conventional eicosanoids and cyclopentenone-type prostaglandins (PGs) 1The abbreviations used are: PGprostaglandinHSPheat shock proteinERendoplasmic reticulumUPRunfolded protein response elementCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseG3PDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenasetkthymidine kinase. , according to their mechanisms of action. Cyclopentenone PGs, such as Δ12-PGJ2 and PGA1, exert a variety of biological actions, including cessation of cell growth, cell differentiation, and development (2Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 3Negishi M. Koizumi T. Ichikawa A. J. Lipid Mediators. 1995; 12: 443-448Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Among them, the prominent action of cyclopentenone PGs is a stress response. Cyclopentenone PGs are produced in response to various stress stimuli and then are actively transported into cells and induce the expression of various stress-related protein genes, including those of a family of cytosolic heat shock proteins (HSPs) (4Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 5Koizumi T. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21779-21784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The PG-induced stress protein gene expression has been shown to require de novo protein synthesis (5Koizumi T. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Biochem.

The requirement of de novo protein synthesis for the cyclopentenone PG-induced gene expression suggests that the site of stress actions of the PGs may be on the regulation of nascent protein processing. However, the molecular characterization of stress actions of cyclopentenone PGs has been hardly carried out. prostaglandin heat shock protein endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response element chloramphenicol acetyltransferase glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase thymidine kinase. BiP is a member of the HSP family of molecular chaperones and plays an important role in the translocation of nascent proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and in their subsequent folding and assembly (9Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). Although BiP mRNA is synthesized constitutively, transcription of the BiP gene is induced by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, which is experimentally induced by various stress treatments, including depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, reducing environment, and block of protein glycosylation (10Shamu C.E. Cox J.S. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 56-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the yeast BiP gene has been identified to contain a regulatory domain, unfolded protein response element (UPR) that responds to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER (11Kohno K. Normington K. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), which is highly conserved among various species (12Resendez Jr., E. Wooden S.K. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4579-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, BiP is a key regulator for newly synthesized protein homeostasis, and the gene expression is critically controlled by an unfolded protein response pathway. From these findings, we postulated that the stress actions of cyclopentenone PGs may be correlated with an unfolded protein response linked to BiP gene expression. Therefore, we examined the effects of the PGs on the BiP gene expression. We report here that cyclopentenone PGs induce the expression of the BiP gene through UPR. Δ12-PGJ2 was a generous gift from Teijin Ltd. (Tokyo). Δ7-PGA1 and tk-CAT vector were kindly supplied by Drs. M. Suzuki (Gifu University) and M. Imagawa (Osaka University), respectively. Other agents were obtained from commercial sources as follows: [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) from DuPont NEN; 1-[14C]deoxychloramphenicol (54 mCi/mmol) from Amersham Corp.; PGA1, PGA2, PGD2, PGE1, PGE2, PGF2α, and PGI2 from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI); A23187 from Calbiochem; and arsenite, diethylmaleate, and tunicamycin from Sigma. The sources of other materials are given in the text. HeLa cells were grown in high glucose Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 4 mM glutamine, and 0.06 mg/ml kanamycin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. Total RNA from HeLa cells was isolated using an Isogen RNA isolation kit (Nippon-gene, Tokyo), and 5 µg of each RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled BamHI/SalI fragment of pSV-BiP (13Kozutsumi Y. Normington K. Press E. Slaughter C. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 11: 115-138Crossref Google Scholar). The same filter was rehybridized with 32P-labeled glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) cDNA probe (Clontech). Hybridization was carried out at 65°C in 6 × SSC, and the filter was washed at 65°C in 2 × SSC. The filter was autoradiographed with x-ray film (Fuji RX). The radioactivity was determined with a Fuji BAS 2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo). Two different sizes of the 5′-flanking region of the human BiP gene (nucleotide residues −126 to +90 and −92 to +90, relative to the transcription start site) were obtained by means of the polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA prepared from HeLa cells, as described previously (14Ting J. Lee A.S. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was first constructed into pCR™-II vector (Invitrogen), and then the HindIII/XbaI insert was constructed into pCAT-Basic Vector (Promega) to generate plasmid −126CAT and −92CAT, containing each 5′-flanking region of the BiP gene, upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. The sequence of the cloned 5′-flanking region was confirmed by sequence analysis by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method. For the functional analysis of enhancer activity of UPR using a heterologous promoter, synthesized DNA fragments, encoding various mutated UPR, were inserted into tk-CAT vector, which carries the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter upstream from the CAT gene (15McKnight S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5949-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and the DNA fragments were located upstream from the tk promoter in the forward and reverse directions. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid DNA constructs by the DEAE-dextran method (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.60Google Scholar). After the cells (3 × 106 cells/assay) had been incubated for 30 min at 37°C in 0.5 ml of serum-free high glucose Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 5 µg of plasmid DNA and 10 µg of DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), they were incubated for 10 min at 37°C with a dimethyl sulfoxide-hypertonic solution (28 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.4 M sucrose, 8% polyethylene glycol 4000, 84 mM NaCl, and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide). They were then cultured in high glucose Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% calf serum. Reactions were started by the addition of the test agents. After incubation for the indicated times, cellular extracts were prepared by four cycles of freezing and thawing. The CAT assay was carried out as described previously (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.60Google Scholar). Cellular extracts containing equal amounts of protein were treated at 65°C for 10 min to inactivate deacetylase and then incubated for 4 h at 37°C with 1-[14C]deoxychloramphenicol (50 nCi) and 0.1 mg/ml acetyl CoA. The reaction mixtures were extracted with ethyl acetate and then separated on a silica TLC plate (F-1500, Schleicher & Schuell). After development of the TLC plate, the radioactivity was quantitated with a Fuji BAS 2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo). CAT activity was normalized as to β-galactosidase activity due to cotransfected Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase, which was assayed as described previously (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.60Google Scholar). A complementary pair of DNA fragments encoding the 3′-half region of UPR (−109 to −99) was synthesized and then annealed as a probe. The fragment was radiolabeled at the 5′-ends with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment. The probe was purified from free nucleotides by Probe Quant G-50 micro column (Pharmacia). Nuclear extracts were prepared by the detergent lysis method of Brock et al. (17Brock T.G. Robert III, P. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear extracts (10 µg) were dialyzed against a binding buffer (25 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), containing 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 3 h at 4°C and incubated with 2 µg of poly(dI-dC) and 1 ng of a 32P-labeled probe (10,000 cpm) for 30 min at 30°C in the binding buffer. The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on native 4% polyacrylamide gels at 4°C at 150 V for 2 h in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), containing 380 mM glycine and 2 mM EDTA. The gels were dried on Whatman 3MM paper and then autoradiographed with x-ray film (Fuji RX). We examined the effect of Δ12-PGJ2 on the expression of the BiP gene in HeLa cells by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, Δ12-PGJ2 progressively increased the mRNA level of BiP, the level reaching 6-fold of the basal level by 24 h. Δ12-PGJ2 caused marked accumulation of the mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner, the maximum being reached at 10 µM (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, the mRNA level of G3PDH did not change. We next examined the specificity of stimulation of the BiP gene expression for various PGs. As shown in Fig. 2A, Δ12-PGJ2 and Δ7-PGA1 markedly increased the mRNA level of BiP. PGA1 also increased it, but the level was very low. However, the other PGs had no ability to accumulate the mRNA. We further examined the effects of various stress inducers on the expression of the BiP gene. As shown in Fig. 2B, tunicamycin and A23187 strongly increased the mRNA level of BiP. Arsenite also elevated the mRNA level, but diethylmaleate showed very low activity. Δ12-PGJ2 was the most potent inducer of the BiP mRNA when it was compared with these inducers. The BiP gene has been shown to be induced by the accumulation of improperly folded proteins newly synthesized in the ER (10Shamu C.E. Cox J.S. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 56-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Then, we examined whether the Δ12-PGJ2-induced expression was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3, cycloheximide pretreatment strongly abolished the Δ12-PGJ2- and tunicamycin-induced accumulation of BiP mRNA, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is necessary for Δ12-PGJ2-induced expression of the BiP gene. To determine whether UPR is the cis-regulatory element for Δ12-PGJ2-induced expression of the BiP gene, we examined the effect of Δ12-PGJ2 on the transient expression of the CAT reporter gene harboring the 5′-flanking region of the BiP gene in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4, Δ12-PGJ2 markedly stimulated the promoter activity of −126CAT, containing UPR, by about 10-fold, but −92CAT without UPR had lost the Δ12-PGJ2 responsiveness, indicating that the stimulation of promoter activity by Δ12-PGJ2 is mediated by UPR. We further examined the effects of several inducers of BiP on the promoter activities of two plasmids. As shown in Fig. 5, Δ12-PGJ2, arsenite, and tunicamycin selectively stimulated the promoter activity of −126CAT, while A23187 slightly stimulated the activities of both plasmids. Thus, UPR is involved in the induction of BiP gene expression by Δ12-PGJ2, arsenite, and tunicamycin but not by A23187. Among these inducers, Δ12-PGJ2 caused the most potent stimulation of the promoter activity.Fig. 5Effects of various inducers on the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of the BiP gene. After cells (3 × 106 cells) had been transiently transfected with −126CAT and −92CAT, they were treated for 12 h with 10 µMΔ12-PGJ2 (J), 50 µM arsenite (As), 5 µg/ml tunicamycin (T), and 0.5 µM A23187. The CAT assay was performed for cellular extracts, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values are expressed as -fold of the untreated cell value transfected with −126CAT or −92CAT and are the means for three independent experiments, which varied by less than 10%. The values for the acetylated chloramphenicol of the untreated cells transfected with −126CAT and −92CAT were 0.62 ± 0.03% and 0.22 ± 0.02%, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To dissect the Δ12-PGJ2 responsive domain in the UPR sequence, we constructed the UPR sequence mutated at either the 5′- or the 3′-half fused to another CAT gene with a heterologous promoter, tk promoter, and then examined the effects of Δ12-PGJ2 on the enhancer activities of the mutant genes. As shown in Fig. 6, Δ12-PGJ2 stimulated the enhancer activity of the 5′-half-mutated UPR in the forward or reverse orientation but not of the 3′-half-mutated UPR, indicating that the Δ12-PGJ2 responsive element is located in the 3′-half of UPR. To identify more precise nucleotides responsible for the Δ12-PGJ2 response within the 3′-half UPR, we mutated three nucleotides in the 3′-half UPR, which are highly conserved among various UPRs (11Kohno K. Normington K. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This point mutation completely abolished the Δ12-PGJ2-induced stimulation of the enhancer activity of the 3′-half of UPR. These results indicate that these three nucleotides in the 3′-half of UPR are essential for the stimulation of the enhancer activity. To identify a nuclear protein that specifically recognizes this region of UPR, we carried out a gel mobility shift assay using the DNA fragment of the 3′-half UPR sequence. As shown in Fig. 7, three retarded bands were detected, and the formation of two protein-DNA complexes with the intermediate and low mobilities were competed for by an excess of unlabeled 3′-half of UPR fragment but not by that of the three nucleotide-mutated 3′-half of UPR fragment, indicating that these two nuclear protein factors specifically recognize the three nucleotides of the sequence of 3′-half of UPR. Two specific protein-DNA complexes were observed in the control cells, but Δ12-PGJ2 induced dissociation of the protein-DNA complex with the lower mobility but not the major complex with the intermediate mobility. Δ12-PGJ2 exerts stress responses through the synthesis of a variety of stress proteins (2Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 3Negishi M. Koizumi T. Ichikawa A. J. Lipid Mediators. 1995; 12: 443-448Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Among the Δ12-PGJ2-induced protein syntheses, the mechanism for the synthesis of cytosolic HSPs has been well characterized (4Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 5Koizumi T. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2457-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Δ12-PGJ2 induces the marked expression of the HSP genes through activation of heat shock factors, which bind to the heat shock element located in the 5′-flanking region of the HSP gene (8Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the 5′-flanking region of mammalian BiP gene does not contain a heat shock element, and thus the heat shock factor is not a regulatory transcription factor for expression of the BiP gene (14Ting J. Lee A.S. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that Δ12-PGJ2 stimulated the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of the BiP gene and then induced the BiP mRNA in HeLa cells, which was sensitive to cycloheximide (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). This action was mediated by UPR, which is a cis-acting element for accumulation of unfolded proteins. This is a new example of cyclopentenone PG-induced gene expression through a cis-regulatory element other than a heat shock element. Among various PGs, the induction of BiP mRNA is specific for cyclopentenone PGs (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we showed that Δ12-PGJ2 and Δ7-PGA1 induced it much more potently than PGA1 among the cyclopentenone PGs. Generally, the biological actions of PGA1 and PGA2 are much weaker than those of Δ12-PGJ2 and Δ7-PGA1 (2Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 3Negishi M. Koizumi T. Ichikawa A. J. Lipid Mediators. 1995; 12: 443-448Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cyclopentenone PGs are thiol-binding molecules. We recently reported that the binding of Δ12-PGJ2 to the intracellular particulate fractions is N-ethylmaleimide sensitive, indicating that the binding sites of Δ12-PGJ2 are thiol groups (18Koizumi T.

Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but Δ12-PGJ2 or Δ7-PGA1 can form a bis-conjugate with two thiols (21Atsmon J. Freeman M.L. Meredith M.J. Sweetman B.J. Roberts II, L.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1879-1885PubMed Google Scholar, 22Atsmon J. Sweetman B.J. Baertschi S.W. Harris T.M. Roberts II, L.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3760-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of PGA1 to synthetic polymer-supported thiols as the model of thiol-containing proteins is reversible, but that of Δ12-PGJ2 or Δ7-PGA1 is irreversible (23Noyori R. Suzuki M. Science. 1993; 259: 44-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The stronger induction of the BiP mRNA by Δ12-PGJ2 and Δ7-PGA1 may be ascribed to their ability to form stable bis-conjugates with thiol groups. Arsenite is also a thiol-binding molecule and forms a metal-protein complex. Arsenite markedly stimulated promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of the BiP gene through UPR and then induced the BiP mRNA (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5), suggesting that its binding to the thiol groups of proteins is involved in the activation of promoter activity through UPR. Thiol reactive agents, including cyclopentenone PGs and arsenite, may induce the BiP gene expression by interaction with the thiol groups of proteins, and this interaction may induce unfolded protein response. We identified three nucleotides within the 3′-half of the UPR sequence that are essential to the Δ12-PGJ2-stimulated enhancer activity (Fig. 6). These nucleotides are highly conserved in UPR sequences of BiP genes of various species from yeast to human and in UPR sequences of GRP94, another ER-resident chaperone (11Kohno K. Normington K. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, the 3′-half of the UPR sequence, including these three nucleotides, is a crucial element for enhancer activity of UPR. We further identified two specific nuclear proteins, which bind to the 3′-half of UPR, and these putative transcription factors specifically recognized the three nucleotides in the 3′-half of UPR sequence, which are essential for the Δ12-PGJ2-induced stimulation of enhancer activity of UPR, indicating that these factors regulate the Δ12-PGJ2-induced BiP gene expression (Fig. 7). The homologous UPR binding activity was also reported to be constitutive, and no differences between control and stressed cells were found in both yeast and mammalian cells (24Mori K. Sant A. Kohno K. Normington K. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2583-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 25Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, we revealed here that the two nuclear factors stably bound to the 3′-half of UPR in the basal condition and that Δ12-PGJ2 induced dissociation of the factor with the lower mobility from the DNA (Fig. 7). Thus, there are two types of nuclear factors for UPR: one nuclear factor constitutively binds to UPR, and the binding of the other factor is regulated by Δ12-PGJ2, indicating that the two factors are functionally different. The Δ12-PGJ2-induced dissociation of the factor may lead to the Δ12-PGJ2-induced stimulation of enhancer activity of UPR. The dissociated factor may play an important role in suppression of the enhancer activity of UPR. We demonstrated here that Δ12-PGJ2 induced expression of the BiP gene through UPR. This suggests that the stress actions of cyclopentenone PGs are mediated by unfolded protein response. Expression of the BiP gene is induced following exposure of eukaryotic cells to diverse conditions, which are related to pathophysiological stress (10Shamu C.E. Cox J.S. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 56-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This response has been suggested to be important for protein homeostasis, from the folding and assembly of newly synthesized proteins to their repair or degradation, during the pathogenesis of disease states, including tissue injury and inflammation (26Rutherford S.L. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1129-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cyclopentenone PGs are final products of the arachidonate cascade, and the cascade serves endogenous stress molecules, cyclopentenone PGs, in such stress conditions. The induction of BiP by the PGs through UPR may play an important role in cytoprotective regulation of protein folding in the stress conditions. This study will contribute not only to our understanding of the BiP gene expression mechanism but will also facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of cyclopentenone PG actions.

https://openalex.org/W2041118432,"In this study, we investigated the influence of the protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent system upon the ability of insulin to stimulate p21ras·GTP loading in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Activation of PKC by 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) did not affect the basal amount of p21ras·GTP but significantly reduced insulin-induced increases in p21ras·GTP. This reduction was due to inhibition of the insulin's ability to stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Sos in cells incubated with 100 nM TPA for either 30 min or 3 h. TPA had no effect on basal activity of Sos.Depletion of PKC by an 18-h incubation with TPA or inhibition by bisindolylmaleimide resulted in profound inhibition of the insulin-induced p21ras·GTP loading. In contrast to PKC activation, removal of PKC did not influence Sos activity but resulted in a 2-fold stimulation of GTPase activating protein (GAP). This effect of PKC depletion is unique to 3T3-L1 adipocytes and was not observed in either 3T3-L1 fibroblasts or Rat-1 fibroblasts. Thus, it appears that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PKC has a constitutive inhibitory effect on GAP that permits insulin to activate Sos and p21ras. Removal of this inhibitory influence activates GAP and reduces insulin-stimulated p21ras·GTP loading.

https://openalex.org/W2119743779,"A Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHOp) was cultured in the presence of benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Tyr diazomethyl ketone (ZLLY-CHN2), to select for resistance to this cell-permeant calpain inhibitor. A clone isolated after several courses of exposure (SHI cells) demonstrated decreased sensitivity to ZLLY-CHN2 toxicity and a decreased growth rate. SHI cells also possessed less µ-calpain isozyme relative to CHOp cells, as determined by activity measurement or by protein immunoblotting. Activities of m-calpain, calpastatin, cathepsin B, cathepsin L, and glycogen phosphorylase were not altered. SHI µ-calpain was partially purified by sequential chromatography on Bio-Gel A-1.5m and DEAE-Sepharose. Its chromatographic behavior in either system was the same as for CHOpµ-calpain. Further studies with the partially purified SHI and CHOpµ-calpain fractions failed to distinguish any difference in Ca2+ requirement or in sensitivity to inhibition by calpastatin or ZLLY-CHN2 for these enzymes. These experiments suggest that SHI cells underproduce a form of µ-calpain which is very similar to, if not identical with, CHOpµ-calpain. SHI cells displayed a population doubling time of 29 h compared with 19 h for CHOp cells. The decreased growth rate of SHI cells was the result of a prolonged G1 phase. Introduction of purified human µ-calpain into SHI cells by electroporation transiently restored the growth rate and also increased toxicity associated with exposure to ZLLY-CHN2.

Proliferation of cells in multicellular organisms is a highly regulated process involving complex extracellular and intracellular signaling events that must occur under strict spatial and temporal coordination (1Norbury C. Nurse P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 441-470Google Scholar, 2Murray A. Hunt T. The Cell Cycle. Freeman, New York1994: 106Google Scholar). Recently, it has become apparent that controlled proteolysis of specific growth regulating proteins is an essential feature of normal cell division (3Murray A.W. Solomon M.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 280-286Google Scholar, 4Minshull J. Pines J. Golsteyn R. Standart N. Mackie S. Colman A. Blow J. Ruderman J.V. Wu M. Hunt T. J.

Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1303-1312Google Scholar) and may contribute to pathologic cell proliferation as well (7Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Google Scholar). Thus far, there is substantial evidence only for participation of the ATP and ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system in proteolysis of growth associated proteins (7Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Google Scholar, 8Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Google Scholar, 9Hershko A. Ganoth D. Pehrson J. Palazzo R.E. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16376-16379Google Scholar). However, it is likely that other regulated intracellular proteolytic enzymes are necessary for cell proliferation. For example, it has recently been shown that conjugation with ubiquitin is not necessary for the degradation of the AP-1 complex constituent, c-Jun (10Jariel-Encontre I. Pariat M. Martin F. Carillo S. Salvat C. Piechaczyk M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11623-11627Google Scholar). An intracellular proteolytic system that could function in cell growth comprises two calcium-dependent proteases, m-calpain (calpain II, m-CANP) and µ-calpain (calpain I, µ-CANP), and their specific inhibitor protein, calpastatin (11Maki M. Hatanaka M. Takano E. Murachi T. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Intracellular Calcium-dependent Proteolysis. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 37Google Scholar, 12Suzuki K. Saido T.C. Hirai S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 674: 218-227Google Scholar). The calpains have an absolute requirement for Ca2+. Given the important role of intracellular Ca2+ as a second messenger, it seems likely that calpain-catalyzed proteolysis is required for some Ca2+-responsive intracellular processes, including cell proliferation. c-Jun and other growth-related transcription factors are excellent calpain substrates (13Hirai S.-I. Kawasaki H. Yaniv M. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 57-61Google Scholar, 14Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A.-M. Roux P. Etienne-Julan M. Lorca T. Piechaczyk M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1679-1689Google Scholar). Transfection of NIH3T3 or F9 cells with calpastatin sense RNA appeared to increase c-Jun stability (13Hirai S.-I. Kawasaki H. Yaniv M. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 57-61Google Scholar). Calpastatin antisense RNA had the opposite effect. Moreover, DNA-binding proteins in isolated rat liver nuclei required very low Ca2+ concentrations for proteolysis by calpains (15Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13920-13924Google Scholar, 16Mellgren R.L. Song K. Mericle M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 653-657Google Scholar). Thus c-Jun or other transcription factors bound to DNA are potential substrates for calpains at the low concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ generated during Ca2+-dependent signal transduction events. Unfortunately, it has proven difficult to gain insight into the physiologic function of the calpains; they display a great deal of flexibility in substrate specificity (17Takahashi K. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Intracellular Calcium-dependent Proteolysis. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 55Google Scholar), and most importantly, a calpain-specific, cell-permeant inhibitor has not yet been developed, although much effort has been invested in this direction (18Wang K.K.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 139-142Google Scholar, 19Mehdi S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 150-153Google Scholar, 20Crawford C. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Intracellular Calcium-dependent Proteolysis. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 75Google Scholar). The best specificity appears to have been achieved with a peptidyldiazomethyl ketone, ZLLY-CHN2, 1The abbreviations used are: ZLLY-CHN2benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Tyr diazomethyl ketoneIMDMIscove's modified Dulbecco's mediumMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxideMTT3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideMops3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albuminA0.5concentration required to produce half-maximum activityI0.5concentration required to produce half-maximum inhibition. which inhibits calpains and cathepsin L (21Anagli J. Hagmann J. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 497-502Google Scholar). Treatment of platelets with radioiodine-labeled ZLLY-CHN2 and subsequent addition of Ca2+ ionophore resulted in specific radiolabeling of calpain large subunit (21Anagli J. Hagmann J. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 497-502Google Scholar, 22Anagli J. Hagmann J. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 93-99Google Scholar). The diazomethyl ketones are irreversible, mechanism-based inhibitors (20Crawford C. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Intracellular Calcium-dependent Proteolysis. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 75Google Scholar, 23Shaw E. Green G.D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 820-825Google Scholar) and allow one to inhibit most of the calpain activity in platelets (21Anagli J. Hagmann J. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 497-502Google Scholar, 22Anagli J. Hagmann J. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 93-99Google Scholar) or cultured cells (24Mellgren R.L. Shaw E. Mericle M.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 164-171Google Scholar). We have recently utilized ZLLY-CHN2 to show that calpain activity is essential for growth of various cultured animal cells (24Mellgren R.L. Shaw E. Mericle M.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 164-171Google Scholar). In the present study, this inhibitor was used as a selecting agent to isolate a CHO cell clone which has diminished µ-calpain content and a reduced proliferative growth rate. benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Tyr diazomethyl ketone Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium dimethyl sulfoxide 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin concentration required to produce half-maximum activity concentration required to produce half-maximum inhibition. Electrophoresis and protein immunoblotting supplies, as well as Bio-Gel A-1.5m, were obtained from Bio-Rad. IMDM was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and bovine calf serum was obtained from Hyclone. Cell culture grade dimethyl sulfoxide (catalog D5879), MTT, DEAE-Sepharose, and vitamin-free casein were obtained from Sigma. ZLLY-CHN2 was synthesized from the peptidyl acid anhydride and ethereal diazomethane (25Crawford C. Mason R.W. Wikstrom P. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 751-758Google Scholar). It was added to culture medium from a 1000-fold concentrated stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. Bovine myocardial m-calpain (15Mellgren R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13920-13924Google Scholar) and human erythrocyte calpastatin (26Mellgren R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 170-176Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. Casein to be used as a calpain substrate was labeled with [14C]formaldehyde by reductive methylation (27Tack B.F. Dean J. Eilat D. Lorenz P.E. Schechter A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8842-8847Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody developed against rat m-calpain, which cross-reacts with hamster µ- and m-calpains, was a generous gift from Dr. John Elce, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Chinese hamster ovary dhfr− cells stably transfected with pSV2dhfr plasmid (28Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4216-4220Google Scholar) were a kind gift from Dr. Edwin Sanchez, Dept. of Pharmacology. They will be hereafter called CHOp cells expressly for ease of discussion. Cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Unless otherwise indicated, the medium utilized was IMDM supplemented with L-glutamine, 25 mM Hepes, and 10% bovine calf serum. To minimize the potential for selection of clones overexpressing mdr-1 gene, which can catalyze efflux of small peptides (29Sharma R.C. Inoue S. Roitelman J. Schimke R.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5731-5734Google Scholar), we treated 50–70% confluent CHOp cells for brief periods (16 h) with 70 µM ZLLY-CHN2. Cells were then allowed to recover in medium without inhibitor. Thus, continuous exposure to ZLLY-CHN2, which might select for cells capable of efficiently exporting the inhibitor, was avoided. This concentration of inhibitor was toxic to a large fraction of CHOp cells, and recovery of survivors occurred over a period of 6–8 days of culture in the absence of inhibitor. After two treatments as described above, the CHOp cells were plated in 2-cm2 culture plate wells at serial dilutions of 30-1000 cells/well and treated once more with 70 µM ZLLY-CHN2 for 16 h. The SHI cells used in this study appeared as a single colony in one of the wells after 1 week of recovery from this final treatment. They were allowed to grow for another week to ascertain that no other colonies appeared in the well and to allow accumulation of sufficient cells to transfer to a 25-cm2 flask for further growth. Proliferative cell growth was measured directly by counting suspended trypsinized cells using a hemocytometer. At least six separate counts were taken for each sample, and the average was taken for calculating cell number. In some experiments, cell growth was estimated by measurement of mitochondrial MTT reductase activity as described previously (30Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Cells were grown in 24-well plates in 1 ml of medium. MTT was added to a final concentration of 2 mM, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Culture medium was removed, and 800 µl of 95% ethanol was added to the wells to solubilize the blue formazan product of MTT reduction. The ethanol suspension was centrifuged, and the A590 of the supernatant was recorded. CHOp or SHI cells were obtained by mitotic shake off from 70% confluent 75-cm2 flasks. Approximately 1000 cells/well were plated in 2.5 ml of IMDM containing 10% bovine calf serum in 9.5-cm2 wells. After 1 h, medium was changed to remove cells that did not attach. Control experiments indicated that plating efficiency under these conditions was approximately 50% for either CHOp or SHI cells. ZLLY-CHN2 was added to a final concentration of 70 µM, and cells were exposed to this inhibitor for 16 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and allowed to recover in medium minus ZLLY-CHN2. After 12 days of recovery, cells were stained for 30 min with 2 mM MTT in culture medium, and colonies ≥16 cells were counted. To investigate the effect of increased µ-calpain content on cell survival, mitotic SHI cells were electroporated in the presence of µ-calpain as described below, and approximately 1000 viable cells (determined by trypan blue dye exclusion) were plated per well in 9.5-cm2 culture plate wells. After 24 h to allow recovery from electroporation, the cells were exposed to 70 µm ZLLY-CHN2 for 16 h and analyzed as described above for colony formation. Mitotic CHOp or SHI cells were collected by shake off, and approximately 10,000 cells were plated per well in 48-well plates. At various times, 0.5 µCi of [3H]thymidine was added to the culture medium in individual wells. After 30 min of incubation, medium was removed, and thymidine incorporation was assayed as described previously (31Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1987: 236Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were extracted with buffer containing SDS, DNA was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the NaOH-solubilized DNA pellet was assayed for 3H by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed with methanol:acetic acid (3:1). Mitotic indices were measured by light microscopy on a minimum of 1000 Giemsa-stained cells. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were grown in 15 ml of IMDM in 75-cm2 flasks until confluent. The cells were washed two times with 5 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37°C and scraped in 0.5 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Mops, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.0. The cells were then homogenized in a small frosted-glass homogenizer. Cell homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g to produce a low speed supernatant fraction. Generally cell supernatants from three 75-cm2 flasks were pooled for each Bio-Gel chromatography experiment. A 1-ml sample of supernatant, equivalent to approximately 2/3 of the total, was applied at 7°C to a 1 × 28-cm column equilibrated in 50 mM imidazole-HCl, 0.2 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.8. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Total calpain activity fractions from Bio-Gel chromatography runs were pooled, avoiding fractions which contained measurable calpastatin activity, and diluted with Bio-Gel equilibration buffer minus NaCl to a final NaCl concentration of 70 mM. Pooled calpain fractions were applied at 7°C to a 4-ml DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mM imidazole-HCl, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.8. Calpain activities were eluted with a 20-ml linear concentration gradient of NaCl, 50–500 mM, in equilibration buffer. One-ml fractions were collected. Calpain activity was determined by release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments from [14C]methyl casein essentially as described previously (32Mellgren R.L. Repetti A. Muck T.C. Easly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7203-7209Google Scholar). Ten microliters of the calpain sample was assayed for 20–30 min. Total calpain activity was determined by assaying in the presence of 5 mM Ca2+, and the µ-calpain isozyme was selectively assayed by using 0.2 mM Ca2+ in the assay. m-Calpain activity was calculated by subtracting µ-calpain activity from total calpain activity. To correct for background proteolysis in cell extracts or chromatography fractions, blanks contained all of the components of the assay mixture including the cell homogenates or column fractions, as well as 16 µg of human calpastatin/ml. The latter is a highly specific inhibitor of calpains (20Crawford C. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Intracellular Calcium-dependent Proteolysis. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 75Google Scholar). Background proteolysis accounted for no more than 2% of the total caseinolytic activity in Bio-Gel chromatography fractions and was not detectable in DEAE-Sepharose column fractions. A unit of calpain activity produces 1 µg of trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments of casein per min under standard assay conditions. Calpastatin activity was determined by its ability to inhibit a defined amount of purified bovine myocardial m-calpain in the standard 14C-caseinolytic assay. Column fractions were heated at 100°C for 10 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Calpastatin is a heat-stable protein and remains in the supernatant fraction. Ten-µl samples of the supernatant were assayed for inhibitory activity utilizing 0.4 unit of purified m-calpain in the incubation mixture. A unit of calpastatin produces 50% inhibition of 1 unit of calpain in the standard calpain assay. Cathepsin L-like activity in cell homogenate supernatants was determined by a modification of the caseinolytic calpain assay. The pH of the buffer was adjusted to 6.0; 10 µM pepstatin A was added to inhibit cathepsin D-like activity, and Ca2+ was replaced by 0.5 mM EDTA. Ten microliters of supernatant was added to 40 µl of substrate at 37°C. After 10–16 h, trichloroacetic acid was added to 2.5%, and trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity was measured as described previously (32Mellgren R.L. Repetti A. Muck T.C. Easly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7203-7209Google Scholar). Other samples of supernatant were assayed in the presence of ZLLY-CHN2, and cathepsin L-like activity was taken as the difference in radioactivity between the assays with and without this inhibitor. One unit of cathepsin L-like activity produces 1 µg of trichloroacetic acid-soluble casein per h. Cathepsin B-like activity was assayed using benzoylarginine β-naphthylamide as substrate (33Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 280-293Google Scholar). A unit produces 1 nmol of β-naphthylamine per min under the standard assay conditions. Total glycogen phosphorylase was measured as described previously (34Illingworth B. Cori G.T. Biochem. Prep. 1953; 3: 1-9Google Scholar) in the presence of mM AMP. A unit of phosphorylase produces 1 nmol of inorganic phosphate per min. The protein concentration of cell homogenate supernatants and column fractions was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) using BSA as the standard. Proteins and cell homogenates were heated to 100°C in the presence of SDS and mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% slab gels using the Laemmli buffer system (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). CHOp cell or SHI cell proteins in the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets and immunostained for m-calpain and µ-calpain large subunits utilizing the anti-rat calpain immune serum obtained from Dr. Elce as first antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody. Human calpain electroporated into SHI cells was detected with a monoclonal antibody derived using human erythrocyte µ-calpain large subunit as the antigen. Immunoreactive bands were stained with indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (37Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Google Scholar). SHI cells were collected by shake off from 12 70% confluent T-75 culture flasks, washed by centrifugation several times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to electroporation based on a previously reported protocol (38Lukas J. Bartek J. Strauss M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 170: 255-259Google Scholar). Two aliquots containing 1.25 × 106 cells each were suspended in 50 µl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 mg of either BSA or human erythrocyte µ-calpain/ml. The samples were incubated on ice in electroporation cuvettes and then electroporated in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporator at 0.26 kV using a pulse time of 20–26 s at a capacitance of 0.125 microfarads. The cells were immediately diluted with 1 ml of warm IMDM containing 0.1 mg of human erythrocyte calpastatin to inhibit extracellular calpain and gently suspended. For measuring uptake of calpain by electroporation, the cells were treated with 100 µg of trypsin/ml for 2–3 min, harvested by centrifugation, and immediately suspended in hot SDS-sample preparation buffer. The solubilized proteins were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The first antibody was a monoclonal antibody which is highly species-specific for human µ-calpain large subunit, and therefore, the hamster µ-calpain in control SHI cells was not detected. Approximation of the amount of µ-calpain incorporated into SHI cells was based on visual comparison of immunostaining of SHI cell extracts with immunostaining of known amounts of purified human µ-calpain, electroblotted from the same gel slab. In other experiments, the electroporated cells were diluted 20-fold in IMDM medium and plated in 24-well culture plates at approximately 5,000 cells/well. Following a 2-h incubation to allow cell attachment, medium was replaced. At various times after plating, cell counts were taken to measure proliferative growth. In a control experiment, it was found that addition of calpain and calpastatin to cells under the same conditions as described above, but without electroporation, did not influence cell growth. p values, where indicated, were derived from Student's t test for nonpaired (independent) samples. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” SHI cells were selected from the parental CHOp cell line on the basis of their resistance to ZLLY-CHN2 toxicity. Resistance of the isolated SHI cells was confirmed by a survival assay performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). Initial characterization studies were performed to compare growth properties of SHI cells compared with the parental CHOp cell line. SHI cells grew at a substantially lower rate than CHOp cells, assayed either by MTT reductase activity (not shown) or direct cell counting (Fig. 2). Under standard culture conditions, the SHI cells had a population doubling time of 29 h, compared with 19 h for CHOp cells. Studies of tritiated thymidine incorporation in CHOp and SHI cells synchronized in mitosis indicate that the major difference in growth rate occurred between mitosis and S phase. This interval was prolonged by 8–10 h in SHI cells (Fig. 3). The decreased growth rate could have been the result of either decreased rate of exit from mitosis or an increased G1 to S phase interval. However, the mitotic index of the SHI cells was 3.4 ± 0.3% compared with 6.7 ± 1.1% for CHOp cells (n = 4), indicating that mitosis is not prolonged in the former. Therefore, the SHI cells appear to take longer than CHOp cells to progress through G1 phase. SHI cells have maintained this reduced growth rate after more than 20 passages in IMDM containing 10% bovine calf serum.Fig. 3Delayed entry of mitotic SHI cells into S phase. SHI cells or CHOp cells were collected by mitotic shake off and plated at a density of 104 cells/cm2 in 0.5-cm2 wells. At various times, DNA synthesis was assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Filled circles, wild-type CHOp cells; open circles, SHI cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Supernatants were prepared from CHOp or SHI cell homogenates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were applied to a gel filtration column, and fractions were assayed for calpains and calpastatin. Several independent experiments indicated that CHOp cell µ-calpain represented 7–10% of total calpain (Fig. 4, panel A). SHI cells contained significantly less µ-calpain activity (Fig. 4, panel B). Calpastatin content was essentially the same for both cell lines. In addition to the calpains, the other major intracellular target of ZLLY-CHN2 appears to be cathepsin L (21Anagli J. Hagmann J. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 497-502Google Scholar, 22Anagli J. Hagmann J. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 93-99Google Scholar). To determine whether SHI cells had altered cathepsin L content, cell homogenate supernatants from SHI and CHOp cells were assayed for cathepsin L-like activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Casein was chosen as the substrate for these experiments because cathepsin L has more activity on protein substrates than other intracellular cysteine proteases, including cathepsins B and H (39Katunuma N. Kominami E. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1983; 22: 71-101Google Scholar). Cathepsin L-like activity was modestly increased in SHI cells at best (Table I). Moreover, assays for cathepsin B, a protease which is not very sensitive to inhibition by ZLLY-CHN2 (25Crawford C. Mason R.W. Wikstrom P. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 751-758Google Scholar), also revealed a slight increase, as did glycogen phosphorylase activity. These data do not support the notion that ZLLY-CHN2 treatment selected for a clone possessing altered cathepsin L levels.Table I.Specific activities of cathepsin L- and B-like activities and glycogen phosphorylase in CHOP and SHI cell extractsEnzymatic activitySpecific activityCHOSHIunits/mg proteinaUnits for each enzymatic activity are defined in the “Materials and Methods.” Values are means ± S.D. for three culture dishes.Cathepsin L-like0.797 ± 0.1010.844 ± 0.111Cathepsin B-like0.520 ± 0.0270.699 ± 0.048Glycogen phosphorylase48.9 ± 4.562.5 ± 5.6a Units for each enzymatic activity are defined in the “Materials and Methods.” Values are means ± S.D. for three culture dishes. Open table in a new tab To further explore possible differences between µ-calpain activity present in SHI and CHOp cells, pooled Bio-Gel fractions from chromatography runs of SHI or CHOp cell extracts were subjected to DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. SHI and CHOp cell µ-calpain activities eluted at the same NaCl concentration, 0.15 M (Fig. 5, panels A and B), which is characteristic for µ-calpain from several different species (40Goll D.E. Edmunds T. Kleese W.C. Sathe S.K. Shannon J.D. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1985; 180: 151-164Google Scholar). Decreased activity of SHI µ-calpain could have been the result of a lower content of this isozyme or some covalent post-translational modification (e.g. phosphorylation) which decreased its specific activity. To resolve this issue, samples of pooled µ-calpain and m-calpain activity peaks from the experiments depicted in Fig. 5, panels A and B, were subjected to immunoblotting experiments. Panels A and B, fractions 12–15, were separately pooled for CHOp and SHI m-calpain. For CHOpµ-calpain, panel A, fractions 8 and 9 were pooled. For SHI µ-calpain, panel B, fractions 9 and 10 were pooled. As expected, CHOp and SHI cells exhibited the same amount of m-calpain immunoreactivity; however, the pooled µ-calpain peak from the SHI cell sample contained less immunoreactivity than the CHOp cell sample (Fig. 5, panel C; lanes 4 and 3, respectively). Further analysis of the pooled SHI µ-calpain peak failed to show any substantial alteration in calcium requirement (A0.5 for Ca2+ = 28 µm for SHI calpain and 41 µm for CHOp calpain) and sensitivity to inhibition by ZLLY-CHN2 (I0.5 = 0.11 µm for SHI calpain and 0.18 µm for CHOp calpain) or by calpastatin (I0.5 = 2.9 pmol for SHI calpain and 3.8 pmol of calpastatin/ml for CHOp calpain). These studies suggest that SHI cells contain a relatively small amount of normal µ-calpain isozyme. When SHI cells were subjected to electroporation in the p"
https://openalex.org/W1970755755,"Ligand-induced conformational changes of GroEL alone and with bound rhodanese, citrate synthase, or dihydrofolate reductase were studied by limited proteolysis. Similar digestion patterns of GroEL, with or without bound substrate polypeptide, were obtained in the absence and presence of the chaperonin ligands, K+, Mg2+, or ATP. The rates of formation and degradation of the six produced proteolytic fragments were significantly different, however. Strikingly, only with Mg2+/ATP or K+/Mg2+/ATP an additional fragment of approximately 25 kDa was generated during digestion of GroEL alone or with bound rhodanese or dihydrofolate reductase, but not with bound citrate synthase. Most of the trypsin-sensitive sites in GroEL were localized in the flexible apical domain, which contains the putative polypeptide-binding region. Our data indicate that subtle structural changes in the trypsin-sensitive regions of GroEL occur as a result of the binding of the chaperonin ligands. However, these structural changes are influenced by the GroEL substrate polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2122003392,"Heterogeneity in type XI procollagen structure is extensive because all three α(XI) collagen genes undergo complex alternative splicing within the amino-propeptide coding domain. Exon 7 of the human and exons 6-8 of the mouse α2(XI) collagen genes, encoding part of the amino-propeptide variable region, have recently been shown to be alternatively spliced. We show that exon 6-containing mRNAs for human α2(XI) procollagen are expressed at 28 weeks in fetal tendon and cartilage but not at 38-44 days or 11 weeks. In the mouse, exon 6 is expressed in chondrocytes from 13.5 days onward. We recently identified conserved sequences within intron 6 of the human and mouse α2(XI) collagen genes, containing additional consensus splice acceptor and donor sites that potentially increase the size of exon 7, dividing it into three parts, designated 7A, 7B, and 7C. We show by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization that these potential splice sites are used to yield additional α2(XI) procollagen mRNA splice variants that are expressed in fetal tissues. In human, expression of exon 7B-containing transcripts may be developmental stage-specific. Interestingly, inclusion of exon 7A or exon 7B in human and mouse α2(XI) procollagen mRNAs, respectively, would result in the insertion of an in-frame termination codon, suggesting that some of the additional splice variants encode a truncated pro-α2(XI) chain.

The collagens are an important class of extracellular matrix components because the structural integrity and functional properties of different tissues are influenced by the characteristic combinations and amounts of these molecules (1Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 103Google Scholar). These triple helical glycoprotein molecules belong to a large family consisting of 19 different types with 30 genes encoding their constituent α chains (2Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 1993; 25: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 3Mayne R. Brewton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Diversity within a single type of collagen can arise not only through varying the combinations of their α chains within heterotrimers, but also from the synthesis of different isoforms arising from alternative splicing of mRNAs. There is increasing evidence for the syntheses of different isoforms within each collagen type arising from alternatively spliced transcripts such as for types II, VI, IX, XI, XIII, XIV, and XVIII collagens (4Chu M.L. Prockop D.J. Collagen: Gene Structure in Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspect. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 149Google Scholar, 5Tillet E. Mann K.

In addition, alternative splicing of α2(I) and α1(III) collagen genes produces mRNAs that could encode a non-collagenous protein and/or truncated collagen, suggesting that some collagen genes may have alternative functions (8Bennett V.D. Adams S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2223-2230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nah H.-D. Niu Z. Adams S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16443-16448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type XI collagen, a fibril-forming collagen, is a heterotrimer composed of α1(XI), α2(XI), and α3(XI) subunits (10Burgeson R.E. Hollister D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and is synthesized as a precursor procollagen molecule with amino- and carboxyl-terminal globular extensions (propeptides). The amino-propeptides in both α1(XI) and α2(XI) procollagen consist of several subdomains, a proline- and arginine-rich peptide region (PARP), 1The abbreviations used are: PARPproline- and arginine-rich peptideVRvariable regionCRconstant regionPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)RTreverse transcription. a variable region (VR), and a constant region (CR). For both of these procollagens the PARP and CR subdomains are similar in size, but the VR subdomain is highly variable both in length and amino acid sequence, raising questions about possible different functional roles of the VR (11Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

We have recently found that heterogeneity in type XI collagen structure may arise from differing combinations of the three α(XI) chains within heterotrimers and homotrimers (13Lui V.C.H. Kong R.Y.C. Nicholls J. Cheung A.N.Y. Cheah K.S.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The heterogeneity in type XI procollagen structure may be more extensive because all three genes for type XI collagen have been shown to undergo alternative splicing within the amino-propeptide coding domain. The VR in the amino-propeptide of α2(XI) procollagen is encoded by exons 5-9 in the gene. Within this coding region, exon 7 of the human and exons 6-8 of the mouse α2(XI) collagen genes have been shown to undergo complex alternative splicing (14Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9486-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2372-2378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Alternative processing has also been demonstrated in the VR of α1(XI) procollagen in human, chick, and rat (14Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9486-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Oxford J.T. Doege K.J. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The pro-α3(XI) chain of type XI procollagen is an overglycosylated variant of pro-α1(II) and therefore is the gene product of the α1(II) collagen gene (17Eyre D. Wu J.J. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 261Google Scholar). Exon 2 of the α1(II) collagen gene is also alternatively spliced, yielding two forms of α1(II) procollagen mRNAs which either include or exclude an exon encoding a cysteine-rich domain in the amino-propeptide (18Ryan M.C. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10334-10339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of the translation products of these different pro-α(XI) alternatively spliced transcripts within type XI procollagen heterotrimers would result in extensive heterogeneity in the structure of the amino-propeptide of type XI procollagen. The genomic organization, intron-exon boundaries, and sequence conservation for the amino-propeptide coding domain of the human and mouse α2(XI) collagen genes have been determined recently, partly by comparing cDNA and genomic sequences (14Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9486-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1996; 32: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In assessing the degree of interspecies sequence conservation for the α2(XI) collagen gene, we had noted a region of conserved sequences containing motifs corresponding to consensus splice acceptor and donor sites within intron 6 of the human and mouse genes (19Lui V.C.H. Ng L.J. Sat E.W.Y. Cheah K.S.E. Genomics. 1996; 32: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have aimed to assess whether these splice signals can function to generate alternative transcripts using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. We show that these potential splice sites are used to yield additional α2(XI) procollagen mRNA splice variants that are expressed in human and mouse fetal tissues. Interestingly, inclusion of one of these additional exons in α2(XI) procollagen mRNAs would result in the insertion of an in-frame termination codon within the VR, suggesting that some of the additional splice variants encode a truncated pro-α2(XI) chain. Human fetal tissues were obtained from elective therapeutic terminations of pregnancy. Approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee of the Medical Faculty, Hong Kong University, for work with fresh embryonic materials. The gestational age of specimens was determined by assessing the centers of ossification (20Patten B.M. Human Embryology. McGraw Hill Maidenhead, OK1976Google Scholar) and the histologic characteristics of the stained sections. The crown-rump length was also measured for intact fresh specimens (21O'Rahilly R. Muller F. Developmental Stages in Human Embryos. Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, D. C.1987Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 104-108PubMed Google Scholar) on double-stranded DNA using Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Longer contiguous stretches of DNA sequence were obtained using the exonuclease/mungbean nuclease method of generating overlapping clones (23Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison analyses were performed using the UWGCG computer program (24Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11513) Google Scholar). The following pairs of oligonucleotide primers were used for cDNA synthesis and PCR. To facilitate cloning of the PCR products, a HindIII adaptor (underlined) was added to the 5′ ends of primers. The locations of these primers are also shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2. An exon 7C primer (OVL142H), 5′-GGCAAGAGGCTCGACTCCAGGA-3′, was used for cDNA synthesis. OVL142H and an exon 5 primer (OVL130U), 5′- GAGCCCAGAGATCTCCACAGCA-3′, were used for first round PCR. Second round PCR was carried out using an exon 5 primer (OVL130R), 5′-ATCAGGAACCCCAGAGCCAG-3′, and another exon 7C primer (OVL131), 5′-CTCTTCACCTGGGGTGGGGT-3′. An exon 7A primer (OVL202), 5′-GCAGTTGGAGAGGGCCTCCGG-3′, was used for cDNA synthesis. OVL202 and OVL130U were used for first round PCR. An exon 7A primer (OVL203), 5′-GCAGGTGGGGTAGGCTTTCA-3′, and OVL130R were used for second round PCR. An exon 7B primer (OVL204), 5′-GGAAATCTCAGATCTTGCAGCCCC-3′, was used for cDNA synthesis. OVL204 and OVL130U were used for first round PCR. Second round PCR primers were OVL130R and OVL205, 5′-GGGGAGAGTGAACCTCCAAG-3′. This was used as an exon 7B primer in conjunction with OVL131 in PCR to generate a human exon 7B probe for in situ hybridization. An exon 7C primer (OVL142), 5′-GGCAAGGGACTGGACTCCAG-3′, was used for cDNA synthesis. OVL142 and an exon 5 primer (OVL140), 5′-GTTCAGGAGCTCCTCGTTGT-3′, was used for first round PCR. Primers used for the second round PCR amplification were OVL141 (5′-CAGGAGCCCCAGAAGCAGGT-3′, exon 5 primer) and OVL131. OVL131 was used as a common exon 7C primer for the mouse and human genes because this sequence was 100% conserved. First strand cDNA was transcribed from 20 µg of total human RNA or 10 µg of total mouse RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (35 units, Seikagaku America Inc. or 200 units, Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) with a corresponding antisense primer as described previously (25Ng L.J. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). One-tenth of the reaction product was used for second strand DNA synthesis and amplification by PCR with the corresponding 5′ sense primer. PCRs were carried out with 1-min denaturation of DNA at 94°C, 1-min annealing reaction at 55°C, 1-min extension reaction at 72°C for 30 cycles. As controls, PCRs were performed with same set of RNAs but without the addition of reverse transcriptase to test for genomic contamination of RNA samples. Second round PCR amplifications were performed with one-fifteenth of the first round amplified products. The PCR amplifications were carried out under the same conditions as the first round PCR amplification reactions. RT-PCR products were either directly cloned into the EcoRV site of pUBS (gift of G. Murphy, AFRC, Norwich) or digested with HindIII (New England Biolabs) and subcloned into the HindIII site of pBluescribe (Stratagene). Southern hybridizations using DNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp., 3,000 Ci/mmol) were at 65°C for 18 h in a mixture containing 3 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 12% polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma), 250 µg/ml heparin (Sigma grade II) (1 × SSC: 0.15 M NaCl, 0.15 M sodium citrate, pH 7.5), with posthybridization washes in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for human RT-PCR samples and in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for mouse samples. Total human and mouse RNAs were prepared by the lithium chloride-urea differential precipitation method (26Lovell-Badge R.H. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 153Google Scholar). RNAs were isolated from week 11 human fetal cartilage and from week 28 human fetal cartilage and tendon. Mouse RNAs were isolated from 1-day-old neonatal cartilage and from day 15.5 whole mouse fetuses. Two human fetuses of 38-42 days and 42-44 days gestation and day 16.5 CBA/n mouse fetuses were collected and processed for in situ hybridization as described (27Wilkinson D.G. Green J. Copp A.J. Cockcroft D.L. Postimplantation Mammalian Embryos: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 155Google Scholar). Single-stranded 35S-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were generated from subclones containing human and mouse pro-α2(XI) collagen gene exons as described previously (25Ng L.J. Tam P.P.L.

An exception was a highly conserved region in the intron sequence between exons 6 and 7, immediately upstream of the splice junction of exon 7 (Fig. 2 and Table I). Interestingly, this conserved region contained additional potential splice acceptor and donor sequences similar to the consensus splice site signals 5′-T/CT/CTTT/CT/CT/CT/CT/CNC|G-3′ (acceptor) and 5′-AG|A/GAGT-3′ (donor) (28Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). One site (site 1, 5′-TCTCTGCTGC|CG-3′ in human, 5′-TCTCTCACTGC|CG-3′ in mouse) is located 450 and 476 bp upstream of the published splice acceptor site for exon 7. The other site (site 2) is a potential donor site (5′-TTACCGGCA|AGAG-3′ in human and 5′-TCGGCAG|AGAG-3′in mouse) 227 and 198 bp 5′ of the exon 7 splice acceptor site in human and mouse, respectively (Fig. 2). Two putative branch point sequences, essential for the formation of the lariat intermediate in mRNA splicing, are present 32-42 nucleotides upstream of each of the exon 7 potential splice acceptor sites (29Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), suggesting that these signals could be functional.Table I.Comparison of exon sizes and sequence identity for the amino-propeptide coding domain of the human and mouse α2(XI) collagen geneExonExon sizeIdentityAmino acidsNucleotide sequencesbp%5 (IaHuman COL11A2 exon number in Ref. 14.)19278.178.6678# (78cExon size in Col11a-2 determined in this study.)96.196.17A250# (252cExon size in Col11a-2 determined in this study.)6082.77B227# (180cExon size in Col11a-2 determined in this study.)5080.27C(IIaHuman COL11A2 exon number in Ref. 14.,7bMouse Col11a-2 exon number in Ref. 15.)63# (63cExon size in Col11a-2 determined in this study.)76.285.7a Human COL11A2 exon number in 14Zhidkova N.I.

Open table in a new tab The presence of additional signals within intron 6 of the α2(XI) collagen gene potentially increases the size of exon 7 and if used, would divide it into three parts, which we have designated 7A, 7B, and 7C as shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2. Exon 7C corresponds to the alternatively spliced exon 7 reported previously in human and mouse (14Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9486-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2372-2378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Utilization of 5′ acceptor site 1 in conjunction with the closest donor (site 2) would yield a separate exon 7A of 250 and 252 bp in human and mouse, respectively. Acceptor site 1 could also be used in conjunction with the donor site at the 3′ end of exon 7C to yield an enlarged exon 7 consisting of parts A, B, and C, 540 bp in size for human α2(XI) collagen mRNA (513 bp for the mouse homolog). Since the sequence at the 5′ end of part 7B was more typical of a donor site than an acceptor, splicing of this exon as a separate exon was probably rare. The third splice variation would result from the use of previously reported splice signals for exon 7 flanking part C, yielding a separate exon 7C of 63 bp (14Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9486-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2372-2378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Translation of the combined sequences within parts A, B, and C of exon 7 for the human gene revealed an open reading frame, in-frame with that for α2(XI) procollagen, which ended in exon 7A because of the presence of the termination codon TGA. Exon 7B also contained a termination codon TAA. In the mouse gene the open reading frame ended within exon 7B with the termination codon TGA. The difference in length of the open reading frame in human and mouse lies in the replacement of the human TGA codon in exon 7A with CCA in the mouse. There were no canonical polyadenylation signals within the intron 7 sequence; however, cleavage and polyadenylation of transcripts containing exon 7A/7B within intron 7 cannot be excluded since in other genes RNA processing can occur even in the absence of a clear consensus sequence (30Wahle E. Keller W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 419-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of an alternative long open reading frame in the combined sequence of exons 1-7C suggests that human pro-α2(XI) mRNAs containing exon 7A or 7B and mouse transcripts containing exon 7B would encode a truncated α2(XI) procollagen containing approximately two-thirds of the intact amino-propeptide that terminates in the variable region. Since assembly of trimeric procollagen molecules requires association of the carboxyl-propeptides, these truncated pro-α2(XI) chains are not expected to associate within trimers. Instead, a non-collagenous polypeptide of 312 and 395 amino acids would be synthesized for human and mouse, respectively. However, in the mouse alternatively spliced transcripts containing exon 7A and not 7B would encode full-length pro-α2(XI) collagen chains. The sequence identity between human and mouse for these alternative exons was high at the amino acid and nucleotide levels (Table I), suggesting a functional role for the truncated pro-α2(XI) chain. Reverse transcription PCR and in situ hybridization were used to determine if the potential additional splice variants of exon 7 could be expressed in vivo in human and mouse fetal tissues. RT-PCR assays using human fetal RNA and oligonucleotide primers to exons 5 and 7C (see “Experimental Procedures”) generated two fragments of 130 and 50 bp from week 28 cartilage and tendon (Fig. 3A). Only the 50-bp fragment was obtained from week 11 cartilage RNA. The sizes of these fragments were consistent with an exon composition of exon 5-6-7C (130 bp) and exon 5-7C (50 bp). The presence of exon 6 within the 130-bp fragment was confirmed by hybridization with an exon 6-specific probe (pVL50; Fig. 3A). Further confirmation of the exon composition of these fragments was obtained by cloning and sequencing the RT-PCR fragments (data not shown). Comparison of the RT-PCR sequence with the human genomic sequence showed that the 130-bp fragment contained exons 5-6-7C and the 50-bp fragment, exons 5-7C; however, no RT-PCR fragments containing exons 7A and 7B were obtained. Although alternative transcripts containing exon 6 have been demonstrated in the mouse (15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2372-2378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), expression in human has not been reported (14Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9486-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine if the failure to detect exons 7A and 7B in the RNA samples truly reflected their absence, primers specific to exons 7A and 7B were also used for RT-PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). No RT-PCR product was obtained using primers to exons 5 and 7B (data not shown); however, two fragments of 190 and 110 bp were generated from week 28 cartilage and tendon RNA using the exon 7A primer (Fig. 3B). For week 11 cartilage RNA only the 110-bp fragment was obtained (Fig. 3B). The 190-bp fragment could not be cloned because of the trace amount of this fragment obtained; however, hybridization of the 190-bp fragment with both exon 6- and exon 7A-specific probes (Fig. 3B) is consistent with an exon 5-6-7A composition. The 110-bp fragment contained exon 5-7A since it hybridized only with the exon 7A probe and not exon 6. This predicted composition of the 110-bp fragment was confirmed by cloning and sequencing the RT-PCR product (data not shown). Since the presence of the termination codon in exon 7A (Fig. 2), predicted from the genomic sequence was confirmed, this fragment represents a transcript encoding a truncated α2(XI) procollagen. Although the relative amounts of the different exon 7-containing transcripts were not measured, in human, mRNAs containing exon 7A were probably of low abundance at the developmental stage studied, since they could only be revealed using exon 7A-specific primers. Total RNAs from mouse fetuses 15.5 days postcoitus and from 1-day-old neonatal mouse cartilage were also analyzed by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers to exons 5 and 7C (see “Experimental Procedures”). For both RNA samples, amplified products of 490, 290, and 130 bp were obtained (Fig. 4). These fragments hybridized with probe pVL5E1, containing exons 5-7 of the human COL11A2 gene (Fig. 3), suggesting complex alternative splicing within this region of the gene. The exon composition within these fragments was determined by cloning and sequencing the RT-PCR fragments (data not shown) and by comparing the DNA sequences with the mouse genomic sequence. Sequence analyses of the cloned RT-PCR fragments revealed that the compositions of the different fragments were as follows: the 490-bp fragment, exons 5-7A-7B-7C; the 290-bp fragment, exons 5-7A-7C; and the 130-bp fragment, exons 5-6-7C (data not shown). These analyses showed that mouse Col11a-2 exon 6 was 78 bp, in agreement with the previous report (15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2372-2378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The sizes of exons 7A and 7B, 252 and 198 bp, respectively, were as predicted from the genomic sequence (Fig. 2). Transcripts containing exons 5-7B-7C were not detected as may be expected if the junction of 7A and 7B acted mainly as a donor site (Fig. 2). Because of the termination codon in exon 7B, the transcript represented by the 490-bp fragment would encode truncated α2(XI) procollagen. The fetal tissue pattern of expression of transcripts containing alternatively spliced exons was studied by in situ hybridization using antisense riboprobes specific for the each of the individual exons 6, 7A, or 7B (Fig. 5). Hybridization signals were at background level for the sense controls for all three riboprobes (reviewed, data not shown). Despite the high sequence homology (80%) between human and mouse exon 7B, background hybridization signals were obtained for the day 42-44 human fetal tissues using the mouse exon 7B probe. In contrast, a strong hybridization signal was obtained in the vertebral bodies using the human exon 7B probe (data not shown), demonstrating the species and sequence specificity of the antisense riboprobes used. Transcripts containing exon 6 were not detected in human fetal chondrocytes at 38-42 days and at 42-44 days (Fig. 5, A and B). It is interesting that exon 6-containing transcripts were also not expressed by week 11 chondrocytes but were found in week 28 cartilage and tendon (Fig. 4). In human, expression of exon 6 transcripts may be restricted to later developmental stages, unlike the mouse where exon 6-containing mRNAs were clearly found in mouse fetal chondrocytes at 16.5 days (Fig. 5C) and at 1 day postpartum (Fig. 4). The expression of mRNAs containing exon 6 by mouse fetal chondrocytes is in contrast to another study where most of the mouse Col11a-2 mRNAs in 3-week-old neonate cartilage lacked exon 6, and expression was found mainly in non-chondrogenic tissues such as muscle, brain, heart, and calvaria (15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2372-2378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, exon 6 mRNAs were reported in developing forelimb bud in embryos between 10 and 14 days. Differences in our findings may reflect stage-specific transient expression of alternative transcripts containing exon 6. Exon 7A and 7B probes hybridized to chondrogenic tissues such as the chondrocytes within the cartilagenous masses within vertebral bodies in both human and mouse (Fig. 5, D-I). The sensitivity of in situ hybridization is usually insufficient for the detection of splicing precursors. The strong hybridization signals for these exons suggest that the inclusion of exons 7A and 7B in transcripts is the result of alternative splicing and does not represent intermediates of mRNA processing. Expression of transcripts containing exon 7B may be stage-specific for human, since exon 7B could only be detected in mRNAs at earlier stages of embryonic development (summarized in Table II). In contrast for the mouse, exon 7B was expressed throughout chondrogenesis from 13.5 days onward2 (this study).Table II.Developmental stage expression of mRNAs containing exons 6,#7A, 7B, and 7C in human and mouseDevelopmental stageExon expressed67A7B7CHuman38-42 daysaDetermined by in situ hybridization.#−++ND42-44 daysaDetermined by in situ hybridization.#−++ND11#weeksbDetermined by RT-PCR.#−+#−+28#weeksbDetermined by RT-PCR.++#−+Mouse15.5#dpca,b++++16.5#dpcaDetermined by in situ hybridization.+++ND1#dppbDetermined by RT-PCR.++++a Determined by in situ hybridization.b Determined by RT-PCR. Open table in a new tab Although the relative levels of the different exon 7 variants were not determined, it is interesting that exon 7C contains a conserved purine-rich sequence 5′-GAAGAGGAAGAA-3′ (Fig. 2), which is similar to that found to act as an exon splicing enhancer in some alternatively spliced genes (for review, see 31Watanabe A. Tanaka K. Shimura Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 32Amendt B.A. Si Z.-H. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Humphrey M.B. Bryan J. Cooper T.A. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3979-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Purine-rich motifs within exons have also been shown to act as splicing silencers in viral genes (34Staffa A. Cochrane A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Exons 7A and 7B also contained purine-rich motifs, but these were shorter. It would be important to determine if these motifs have a role in regulating usage of the alternative exon 7 splice sites. The presence of premature termination codons in genes has been shown to accelerate the decay rate of mRNAs, a phenomenon called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (35Lim S.-K. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cui Y. Hagan K.W. Zhang S. Peltz S.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Skipping of exons containing a premature termination codon has also been observed for fibrillin and ornithine δ-aminotransferase genes (37Dietz H.C. Valle D. Francomano C.A. Kendzior Jr., R.J. Pyeritz R.E. Cutting G.R. Science. 1993; 259: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The presence of the premature termination codon in mRNAs that include exon 7A and 7B therefore raises questions about the stability and the efficiency of translation of these transcripts and whether levels of the truncated pro-α2(XI) polypeptide may be low. An additional question would be whether the premature termination affects splice site selection frequency. The in situ hybridization data did not show an especially low level of exon 7A- or exon 7B-containing transcripts in human and mouse. The presence of the termination codon therefore probably had not affected mRNA stability. Although the physiologic significance of the synthesis of truncated α2(XI) collagen is unknown, the synthesis of truncated α2(XI) collagen chain may be important since it is conserved among different species. Another question arising would be whether the PARP peptide previously thought to be a processed product of α2(XI) procollagen (38Neame P.J. Young C.N. Treep J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20401-20408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is the product of mRNAs encoding a truncated pro-α chain. This truncated polypeptide, although larger, includes the PARP domain, and PARP peptide could be derived from it by further processing. Our data have shown by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses that the splice signals present in intron 6 are utilized in both human and mouse, giving rise to additional splice variants of α2(XI) procollagen mRNA. Interestingly, the expression of exons 6 and 7B may be developmental stage-specific in human (Table II). In addition to the alternatively spliced exons 6, 7A, and 7B identified in the present study, exons 7C and 8 have also been shown to be alternatively spliced in the mouse (15Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2372-2378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). With the exception of the alternative transcripts that encode truncated α2(XI) procollagen, the added differential usage of these exons could generate great diversity in the structure of the amino-propeptide of α2(XI) procollagen and therefore in heterotrimeric type XI procollagen. Several functions have been proposed for the amino-propeptide of fibril-forming collagens. Proposals based on studies on types I and III procollagen include a role of retained propeptide in preventing premature fibril formation intracellularly and in regulating fibril diameter (39Kuhn K. Weistner M. Krieg T. Muller P.K. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 10: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 40Fleischmajer R. Perlish J.S. Burgeson R.E. Shaikh-Bahai F. Timpl R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Biosynthetic studies have shown that parts of the amino-propeptides of pro-α1(XI) and pro-α2(XI) are retained within fibrils (41Morris N.P. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11345-11350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Thom J.R. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7262-7269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may be important for their proposed roles in regulating fibrillogenesis and modulating fibril diameter (43Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Barbiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Birk D.E. Silver F.H. Trelstad R.L. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It is also interesting that the amino-propeptides of type I and III procollagen have been shown to be capable of down-regulating collagen synthesis by cultured fibroblasts and in cell-free translation assays (39Kuhn K. Weistner M. Krieg T. Muller P.K. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 10: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 46Paglia L.M. Wilczek J. de Leon L.D. Martin G.R. Horlein D. Muller P.K.

The possible synthesis of truncated amino-propeptide for α2(XI) procollagen raises further questions about potential roles for these polypeptides in regulating biosynthesis at the translational level. The complex alternative splicing found for the α1(XI) and α2(XI) collagen genes with its resulting structural diversity within the amino-terminal region and the developmental stage differences in expression raise questions about possible differing functional roles for the amino-propeptide. The roles are expected to differ depending on whether the amino-propeptide is retained, cleaved, or synthesized as a separate polypeptide."

The mechanisms of intercellular adhesion in primitive species have also been under investigation for many years. The first cell adhesion study was performed at the turn of the century using a simple animal model, the sponge. Wilson (17Wilson H.V. J. Exp. Zool. 1907; 5: 245Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar) demonstrated that when disrupted into single cells, suspensions of sponge cells rapidly readhered to one another and reformed new sponges. By mixing single cell suspensions of different sponge species that were identifiable by their different intrinsic colors, Wilson (18Wilson H.V. Bull. Bur.

Since those initial studies, investigators utilized invertebrate or nonmammalian vertebrate animal models of embryogenesis and development to uncover the molecular mechanisms governing cell adhesion. Nonmammalian animal models of cell adhesion include slug formation in the slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum (19Springer W.R. Cooper D.N.W. Barondes S.

Although advancements in cell and molecular biology have recently enabled a better understanding of the nature of cell adhesion in mammalian species, continued studies into the mechanisms of adhesion in more primitive species is important to gain a basic understanding of the rigorously conserved features of cell adhesion molecules that have been selected by evolution. Studies on the mechanism(s) of cell adhesion in the sponge have indicated that the reaggregation of sponge cells is mediated by a large proteoglycan-like molecule termed “aggregation factor” (31Humphreys T. Dev. Biol. 1963; 8: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Henkart P. Humphreys S. Humphreys T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3045-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Aggregation factor has glycan- and calcium-dependent self-interaction sites (33Misevic G. Jumblatt J. Burger M.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1980; 12: 3045-3050Google Scholar). This molecule has been characterized as a large (2 × 107 daltons) stable proteoglycan on the basis of chromatographic and ultracentrifugation studies (32Henkart P. Humphreys S. Humphreys T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3045-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 33Misevic G. Jumblatt J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6931-6936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This aggregation factor binds to sponge cells with a high affinity (33Misevic G. Jumblatt J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6931-6936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, a 210-kDa protein was isolated and was shown to be a high affinity cell surface and extracellular matrix glycoprotein which plays a significant role in cell adhesion. Characterization of this protein suggests that it may represent one of the earliest extracellular matrix adhesion proteins to have arisen in metazoan evolution. Sponges were obtained from the supply department of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, and maintained in artificial seawater at 4°C. Nitrocellulose was obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. IODO-BEADS were from Pierce, and peanut agglutinin-Sepharose was from Vector Labs, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). Ampholines, lentil lectin, concanavalin A, and CNBr-Sepharoses were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. X-AR film was obtained from Kodak. Na125I was from Amersham Corp. Prestained molecular mass markers were from Life Technologies, Inc. Peptide N-glycosidase was from Boehringer Mannheim. The Phast-gel system was from Pharmacia. Isoelectric focusing standard proteins were from Sigma. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Problott) was from Promega (Madison, WI). Protein samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 0.5 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris, pH 8.8, 5% glycerol, with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol only where specifically described), boiled 3 min, and electrophoresed on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels using the buffers of Laemmli (38Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206961) Google Scholar). Aggregation factor binding proteins were assayed by Western blotting using minor modifications of the procedures described by Towbin et al. (39Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44883) Google Scholar). Transfers to nitrocellulose were for 4 h at 400 mA in 192 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris base at 4°C. The blots were blocked at 4°C overnight in 3% (v/v) bovine serum albumin, 1% casein, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, incubated in iodinated aggregation factor in blocking buffer, washed for 10 min per each of five changes of 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and autoradiographed for 2 days. Aliquots of extracts or column fractions were spotted onto a sheet of nitrocellulose. The sheet was allowed to dry, was wetted by capillary action, and was blocked for 24 h at 4°C in block buffer. Blots were then incubated in iodinated aggregation factor in block buffer for 24 h at 4°C, washed five times in 0.5 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris, pH 8.0, and then autoradiographed for 2 days. Cell suspensions from five large sponges containing 1012 cells were three times frozen at −80°C and thawed and homogenized in a final volume of 320 ml of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with 10 strokes of a hand-held Potter-Elvejhem type homogenizer. Membranes were recovered from the homogenate by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 1 h in a Ti60 rotor at 4°C and extracted in 320 ml of 0.25% octylpolyoxyethylene, 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and leupeptin for 12 h at 4°C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 1 h in a Ti60 rotor at 4°C. Extracts were concentrated by ultrafiltration with an Amicon device at 4 atm of N2 using YM30 membranes at 4°C until the final volume equalled 20 ml. The extract was dialyzed versus 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, for 12 h at 4°C with three changes of buffer, and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a Ti60 rotor for 1 h at 4°C to remove insoluble proteins. A 15-ml QAE-Sephadex column was prepared in a plastic syringe plugged with glass wool and was washed with a gradient of 70 ml of 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, to 1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. After re-equilibration to starting conditions, the 20-ml concentrated membrane extract was applied to the column. After washing the column to remove unbound proteins, adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear 70-ml salt gradient (150 mM to 1 M NaCl). Two-ml fractions were collected, and 100 µl of every fraction were assayed by Coomassie Blue staining of 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and by Western blotting and 50 µl of every fraction by dot blotting. Fractions containing 210-kDa aggregation factor-binding activity were pooled, dialyzed versus 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, and concentrated by Amicon ultrafiltration using YM30 membranes. Concentrated QAE-Sephadex fractions containing 210-kDa protein were chromatographed on a 160-ml (1.5 × 90 cm) Sepharose 6B column in 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 2.3-ml fractions were collected. One hundred-microliter aliquots of each fraction were assayed by Western blotting, and 50-µl aliquots of each fraction were assayed by dot blotting. The optical density profile at 280 nm for the column elution was also determined. The 210-kDa protein-containing fractions were concentrated by Amicon ultrafiltration on YM30 membranes and were chromatographed on a 110-ml (1.5 × 70 cm) Sepharose 4B column in 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The optical density of each 2-ml fraction was determined. Protein peaks were pooled and concentrated and samples assayed after electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels by Western blotting. Inhibition of aggregation assays were performed by incubating 3 µg of aggregation factor (3 aggregation units, AU) with 200-µl aliquots of column fractions in wells of a 24-well culture plate for 30 min at room temperature. 4 × 107 cells of a single cell suspension in 200 µl were added, and the plates were shaken on a rotary shaker for 30 min at room temperature. The degree of aggregation was determined by comparison with that induced by dilutions of aggregation factor in a standard aggregation assay. Percent inhibition was plotted versus fraction number. Fifty µl (0.5 µg) of purified 210-kDa protein was combined in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with 0.5 mCi of Na125I and one IODO-BEAD for 30 min at room temperature. Free iodine was removed by chromatography on a 2-ml Sephadex G-50 column in 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8. Twenty-microliter samples of the iodinated 210-kDa protein were electrophoresed on a nonreducing 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and on a 1-mm isoelectic focusing tube gel in a 9 M urea, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol sample buffer for 13.5 h. The isoelectic focusing tube gel was then electrophoresed on a reducing second dimension 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After fixation and drying, the gels were analyzed by autoradiography. Duplicate aliquots of 0.1 µg of purified 210-kDa protein were placed in 40 µl of 0.5% SDS, 100 mM Tris, pH 8.8, and 10 mM EDTA and then denatured by boiling for 3 min. Samples were adjusted to 1% Nonidet P-40 by addition of 5 µl of 10% Nonidet P-40. Five µl (0.25 units) of peptide N-glycosidase was added to one test, and 5 µl of glycerol was added to the other (control) samples. Both samples were incubated for 12 h at 37°C, and then 25 µl of 50% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue was added. Samples were boiled for 3 min, loaded onto 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed by silver staining. One hundred µl of packed lentil lectin, concanavalin A, peanut agglutinin, and unconjugated Sepharose resins were washed in 1 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris, pH 8.0, at 4°C overnight and then rinsed three times in 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris, pH 8.0 (lysis buffer) by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 rpm. 5 × 107 cells were solubilized in 100 µl of lysis buffer. One hundred microliters of lysates were incubated with each resin with rotation for 2 h at 4°C. Lectins were always maintained in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MnCl2. Unbound lysates were removed and resins washed four times with lysis buffer. Bound protein was solubilized in SDS sample buffer, as was a sample of the lysate. Samples were evaluated by the aggregation factor Western blotting assay. Sponge cell adhesion depends on an extracellular matrix proteoglycan that is thought to promote adhesion based on its ability to bind to a putative cell surface ligand. A potential cell surface ligand for this proteoglycan, a sponge proteoglycan-binding protein of 210 kDa, was previously identified by a ligand binding Western blotting assay (40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein was characterized as a nonintegral membrane, cell surface-bound extracellular matrix protein ligand for the major sponge proteoglycan (40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was characterized as a nonintegral membrane protein on the basis of its solubility in the absence of detergent, failure to bind lipid, and presence in preparations of sponge extracellular matrix as well as in detergent and nondetergent extracts of sponge membranes. A 68-kDa peripheral membrane/extracellular matrix protein ligand for the sponge proteoglycan was also identified using this assay (40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was recently purified and characterized as a cell adhesion protein (41Varner J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3119-3126PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, experiments were designed to purify the 210-kDa sponge proteoglycan ligand and to establish its role as a sponge adhesion protein. A 210-kDa aggregation factor binding protein was purified by a combination of anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography using an extraction procedure that was selected in order to maximize the ratio of 210-kDa protein to contaminating proteins. An octylpolyoxyethylene extract of sponge membranes was dialyzed to remove detergent, and the resulting soluble extract was initially applied to a 15-ml QAE-Sephadex column. The QAE-Sephadex column was eluted with a linear salt gradient (0.15-1.0 M NaCl). While the majority of the extracted protein eluted in fractions 1–21 of an anion exchange column eluate (Fig. 1, upper panel), the 210-kDa protein eluted in fractions 36–47 (0.8-1.0 M NaCl), as detected by the binding of radiolabeled aggregation factor to Western and dot blots (Fig. 1, middle and lower panels). The 210-kDa protein was clearly separated from the 68-kDa aggregation factor ligand that eluted in fractions 29–35 and that was previously purified and characterized (40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Varner J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3119-3126PubMed Google Scholar). To purify the 210-kDa protein further, the anion exchange column fractions 36–47 were applied to a Sepharose 6B sizing column. The 210-kDa aggregation factor binding activity eluted in the column void volume, in fractions 20–30 (Fig. 2, middle and lower panels) but apart from the majority of the total protein (Fig. 2, upper panel). The 210-kDa Sepharose 6B column void volume fractions 20–30 were then chromatographed on a Sepharose 4B column. Two major protein peaks were detected by optical density measurements at 280 nm (Fig. 3A). The 210-kDa protein peak with aggregation factor binding activity was detected exclusively in the first included peak, in fractions 18–24, using the aggregation factor Western blotting assay (Fig. 3B). A yield of 500 µg of 210-kDa aggregation factor ligand was obtained from 5 g of total cell protein using this procedure, with an enrichment of 1600-fold, based on the aggregation factor Western blot binding assay (Table I).Table IPurification of 210-kDa MAF ligandFractionation stepYieldTotal activitySpecific activityEnrichmentµg proteincpm MAF boundcpm MAF/µg proteinCells (1012)5 × 1067 × 1062Membranes2.5 × 1056.4 × 10625612.8Extract5 × 1043.3 × 1066633QAE peak1.8 × 1043 × 10617085Sepharose 6B peak1.8 × 1032 × 1061111555Sepharose 4B peak5001.6 × 10632001600 Open table in a new tab Purification of the 210-kDa protein ligand permitted further analysis of its biological and biochemical characteristics. A sample of the Sepharose 4B protein peak was radiolabeled by iodination and evaluated for purity by gel electrophoresis. Electrophoretic analysis of the pooled and concentrated 210-kDa protein on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography (Fig. 4, 125I) and silver staining (Fig. 4, Silver) revealed a single protein band of 210-kDa in both cases, indicating that the 210-kDa protein had been purified to homogeneity. Analysis of an unlabeled sample by the aggregation factor Western blot binding assay (Fig. 4, MAF Overlay) verified that this purified protein retained the aggregation factor binding activity and that no other aggregation factor binding protein was present in these protein preparations. The 210-kDa protein-aggregation factor interaction is sensitive to reduction; the 210-kDa protein binds aggregation factor when it has been electrophoresed on nonreducing but not on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels prior to Western blotting (40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the effect of reduction on its binding properties, no change in the migration of the 210-kDa protein under reducing conditions was observed (Fig. 5A). Because the migration of the protein, in contrast to its interaction with aggregation factor, does not change upon reduction, these results suggest that one or more intrachain disulfide bonds that do not significantly affect SDS gel migration play a role in the secondary structure of the active site. An analysis of the 210-kDa protein by one- and two-dimensional isoelectric focusing revealed an isoelectric point of 4.3 (Fig. 5B), with a slight heterogeneity of focused bands at that pI. Minor heterogeneity of isoelectric points in a purified protein is often attributed to slight differences in glycosylation or other post-translational modifications (42Righetti P.G. Creighton T. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 23Google Scholar). An analysis of the glycosylation state of the 210-kDa protein undertaken by digestion of the purified 210-kDa protein with glycosidases suggests that it is not highly glycosylated (data not shown; 40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, an analysis of the affinity of the 210-kDa protein for lectins by lectin affinity chromatography demonstrates that the 210-kDa protein contains some complex glycan. The 210-kDa protein bound lentil lectin Sepharose (Fig. 6, lane A) and peanut agglutinin Sepharose (Fig. 6, lane B), but not concanavalin A-Sepharose (Fig. 6, lane C), which selectively binds high mannose-type glycans. These results indicate that the 210-kDa protein is a glycoprotein with complex-type glycans, but also that it is not highly glycosylated. To demonstrate that the 210-kDa protein purified from the cell surface is indeed the same as that found in the extracellular matrix of the sponge, aggregation factor was allowed to bind preparations of the extracellular matrix and to purified 210-kDa protein by incubation of Western blots with iodinated aggregation factor (not shown). On the basis of molecular weight and affinity for aggregation factor in Western blotting assays, the purified cellular 210-kDa protein appears to be identical to the 210-kDa protein that is present in preparations of extracellular matrix. These results verify the previously published observation (40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the 210-kDa protein is in fact an extracellular matrix protein with binding sites for the proteoglycan aggregation factor and the cell surface. Purified 210-kDa protein was examined for its ability to inhibit aggregation factor-mediated cell adhesion. The 210-kDa protein was able to inhibit completely sponge cell aggregation (Fig. 7A). A concentration of 8 µg/ml was required to inhibit 50% of the aggregation induced by 1 µg of aggregation factor. In contrast, other protein fractions such as those from the second included peak of the Sepharose 4B chromatography column, a purified 220-kDa sponge protein which does not bind aggregation factor in the Western blotting assay and which is distinct from the 210-kDa protein in that it elutes from the anion exchange column in the flow-through and contains a covalently attached chromophore, 1J. A. Varner, unpublished data. as well as purified mammalian extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, and gelatin, were not able to inhibit the aggregation factor-mediated aggregation of sponge cells (Fig. 7A). These findings suggest that the 210-kDa protein is specifically associated with sponge cell adhesion. Scatchard analysis (43Scatchard C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1959; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17795) Google Scholar) of the affinity of aggregation factor for immobilized 210-kDa protein indicates that the interaction is of high affinity (Kd = 7 × 10−9M; Fig. 7B). In further support of the role of the 210-kDa protein in sponge cell adhesion are experiments that demonstrate that immune sera containing antibodies that immunoprecipitate the 210-kDa protein (40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not preimmune sera, potently inhibit the binding of aggregation factor to sponge cell surfaces (Fig. 7C). These antisera also inhibit sponge cell adhesion.1 Taken together, these results indicate that the 210-kDa protein plays a major role in sponge cell adhesion. Cell-to-cell and cell-to-substrate adhesion molecules are key elements of both normal and pathological events that include the immune response, development, tumorigenesis, and metastasis (4Hynes R.O.

Several families of integral membrane cell adhesion proteins including the integrin (15Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar, 16Cheresh D.A. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 6: 225-252Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), selectin (13Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar), immunoglobulin (12Edelman G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1988; 5: 869-876Google Scholar), and cadherin (13Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar) superfamilies have been extensively characterized during the past decade. Although much is now known about mammalian adhesion molecules, invertebrate and nonmammalian animal models of cell adhesion have been the focus of cell adhesion research since the turn of the century. An understanding of the events and the evolutionary forces that drive change among adhesion molecules can lead to a better understanding of mammalian adhesion molecules and their mechanisms of action. For example, purified extracellular matrix proteins have been recently studied from a number of nonmammalian or invertebrate species to acquire insight into the functions and evolution of these kinds of molecules (44Pan Y. Doolittle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2066-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Xu X. Doolittle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 46Erickson H.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The first cell adhesion study, however, was performed as early as 1907 using the sponge, a primitive metazoan, as a simple animal model of cell aggregation (17Wilson H.V. J. Exp. Zool. 1907; 5: 245Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Research on the mechanisms of cell adhesion in the sponge later demonstrated that sponge cell adhesion is mediated by a large, calcium-dependent proteoglycan-like molecule termed aggregation factor (31Humphreys T. Dev. Biol. 1963; 8: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Henkart P. Humphreys S. Humphreys T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3045-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) which has high affinity cell-binding sites (33Misevic G. Jumblatt J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6931-6936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 210-kDa cell surface ligand for the aggregation factor was first identified and characterized as a cell surface-associated extracellular matrix protein using iodinated aggregation factor as a probe in a Western blotting assay (40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was characterized as a nonintegral membrane, extracellular matrix protein on the basis of its solubility in the absence of detergent, failure to bind lipid, and presence in preparations of sponge extracellular matrix as well as in detergent and nondetergent extracts of sponge membranes. In the studies described in this report, this 210-kDa invertebrate extracellular matrix ligand for the adhesion-mediating proteoglycan aggregation factor was purified to homogeneity. Several lines of evidence suggest that the 210-kDa protein plays a major role in cell adhesion in sponges. First, the 210-kDa protein has a high affinity for aggregation factor (Kd = 7 nM), and it binds aggregation factor in affinity chromatography experiments (40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on Western and dot blots. Second, the 210-kDa protein can completely inhibit the aggregation of cells mediated by aggregation factor. Third, antibodies that immunoprecipitate the 210-kDa protein also block aggregation factor binding to cells and aggregation factor-mediated cell adhesion. Together, these observations suggest that the 210-kDa ligand functions to anchor aggregation factor to the cell surface and to mediate cell adhesion. The 210-kDa ligand for the sponge proteoglycan has a subunit molecular mass of 210-kDa, but a larger native molecular mass, suggesting that it forms macromolecular complexes, as do extracellular matrix proteins such as tenascin (46Erickson H.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The function of the protein is dependent on intramolecular, but not intermolecular, disulfide bonds because reduction decreases its ability to bind its ligand, aggregation factor, but not its migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The aggregation factor-interaction site is also dependent on a structure that is sensitive to proteolysis (40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cyanogen bromide cleavage.1 A slight charge and size heterodispersity exhibited on isoelectric focusing gels may be due to a slight amount of glycosylation. Although its migration on gels is not altered by glycosidase digestion, the protein binds lentil lectin and peanut agglutinin Sepharoses and hence appears to be a complex-type glycoprotein. Although early experiments suggested that the 210-kDa aggregation factor ligand did not bind lectins (40Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a more detailed analysis of lectin binding indicated that the 210-kDa protein does weakly bind lentil lectin and peanut agglutinin. The 210-kDa protein is found on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix, suggesting its role as an extracellular matrix protein that serves as an intermolecular bridge between a cell surface receptor and the proteoglycan-like aggregation factor. Although sponges are among the most primitive of metazoans, their extracellular matrix resembles that of higher species. The sponge extracellular matrix is composed of collagen fibrils (47Exposito J.-Y. LeGuellec D. Lu Q. Garrone R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21923-21928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proteoglycans, and perhaps structural proteins. It is possible that homologues of the mammalian structural extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, or fibrinogen that bind to both cell surface receptors, collagen, and extracellular matrix proteoglycans (48Hynes R.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 67-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 49Martin G. Timpl R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) exist in sponges. In fact, a 230-kDa tenascin-like hexamer with immunoreactivity to anti-tenascin antibodies has recently been described in one sponge species (50Humbert-David N. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 210-kDa protein described in this article may play a role similar to that of these structural matrix molecules in that it associates with the cell surface and with a matrix proteoglycan; it may be a homologue of the sponge tenascin molecule recently described (50Humbert-David N. Garrone R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The evidence for the role of this 210-kDa protein in cell adhesion and for its presence in the extracellular matrix as well as on the cell surface suggests that the 210-kDa protein may be an ancestral extracellular matrix molecule. This novel 210-kDa extracellular matrix protein ligand for the sponge proteoglycan aggregation factor may be one of the most evolutionarily primitive extracellular matrix proteins yet described. Sequence analysis (via protein and cDNA sequencing) should help establish the ancestry of this matrix adhesion protein and to define the evolutionary lineages of some of the more well characterized vertebrate adhesion proteins."

In the preceding paper, we showed that generation of FXaβ leads to expression of a plasminogen binding site. FXaβ may consequently participate in fibrinolysis; therefore, the timing of subform conversion compared with thrombin production is important. In the current study we evaluated the kinetics of FXaβ generation, which showed that autoproteolysis of FXaα followed a second order mechanism where FXaα and FXaβ behaved as identical enzymes. Rate constants of 9 and 172 M−1 s−1 were derived, respectively, in the absence and presence of FXaα binding to procoagulant phospholipid. Under identical conditions the latter is estimated to be 6 orders of magnitude slower than thrombin generation by prothrombinase. Since heparin binding and prothrombin recognition have been previously attributed to a region of FXaα proximal to the β-peptide, functional comparisons were conducted using homogeneous and stabilized preparations of FXaα and FXaβ. Comparisons included 1) the recognition of small substrates; 2) the rate of interaction with antithrombin/heparin; 3) the assembly of prothrombinase; and 4) the activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase. Although the β-peptide neighbors a probable functional region in FXaα, conversion to FXaβ was not observed to influence these functions. The data support a model where FXaα is predominantly responsible for thrombin generation and where slow conversion to FXaβ coordinates coagulation and the initiation of fibrinolysis at sites of prothrombinase assembly.

The established function of coagulation factor Xa (FXa) 1The abbreviations used are: FXafactor XaFXfactor XFVafactor VaPCPSphosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserineATantithrombin; pAB,para-aminobenzamidineEGRckGlu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketoneDAPAdansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amideRVVRussell's viper venomPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is to generate thrombin. In association with the cofactor Va (FVa), procoagulant phospholipid (PCPS), and Ca2+ to form the prothrombinase complex, FXa activity is accelerated to a level that is required to overcome anticoagulant barriers (1Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 2Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 222: 260-280Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One of the anticoagulants that regulates FXa is antithrombin (AT), which is a member of the serpin family of proteins (3Sheffield W.P. Wu Y.I. Blajchman M.A. Roberts H.R. High K.A. Molecular Biology of Thrombosis and Hemostatis. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 355Google Scholar). AT functions by forming a 1:1 irreversible complex with a susceptible serine protease and utilizes heparin as a cofactor to increase its inhibitory activity by several hundred-fold in the case of FXa (4Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 222: 525-559Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Recently, a new function for FXa has been described (5Pryzdial E.L.G. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17871-17877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The evidence suggests that FXa is capable of interacting with the fibrinolysis zymogen, plasminogen. In doing so, FXa enhances the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated generation of plasmin by approximately 2 orders of magnitude. factor Xa factor X factor Va phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine antithrombin; pAB,para-aminobenzamidine Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide Russell's viper venom polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the preceding paper we demonstrated that autoproteolytic excision of a small COOH-terminal peptide (β-peptide) from the intact FXa subform, FXaα, to yield FXaβ, was necessary for the expression of a plasminogen binding site. Combined with earlier observations (5Pryzdial E.L.G. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17871-17877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Lee C.D. Mann K.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9750-9755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this finding fits into a regulatory model that coordinates the participation of FXaα in coagulation and subsequently in fibrinolysis. Whether FXaα or FXaβ is the prevalent enzyme during thrombin production has not been previously reported. Therefore, an assumption made in the model is that the conversion of FXaα to FXaβ is slow relative to the generation of thrombin, which is necessary to prevent the initiation of fibrinolysis prior to sufficient clot formation. The effect of FXaα conversion to FXaβ on procoagulant and anticoagulant functions has not been investigated in adequate detail. The only direct studies comparing FXa subform activity used clotting assays containing PCPS, and the results were contradictory. Some of the reports supported the conclusion that the specific activity of FXaα is greater than that of FXaβ (8Jesty J. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 509-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jesty J. Esnouf M.P. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), while others showed that the subforms behave the same (10Jesty J. Spencer A.K. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5614-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fujikawa K. Coan M.H. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5290-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These inconsistencies could be explained by the known acceleration of FXaα autoproteolysis by PCPS (10Jesty J. Spencer A.K. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5614-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Link R.P. Castellino F.J.

A. 1975; 72: 3359-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which may make FXaβ the effective enzyme in some clotting assays regardless of the subform that is initially present. In an effort to localize important functional areas in FXa, a COOH-terminal region that closely neighbors the β-peptide has been previously identified. The functions that were implicated are the binding of the anticoagulant cofactor, heparin (15Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and recognition of the prothrombinase substrate, prothrombin (16Chattopadhyay A. James H.L. Fair D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12323-12329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to proximity, it is conceivable that excision of the β-peptide may influence these functions. Any such influence would be compounded when fibrinolysis is triggered, since, as the preceding paper demonstrated, plasmin generates a species indistinguishable from FXaβ at least 3 orders of magnitude faster than autoproteolysis. In the current study, the kinetic mechanism of FXaβ production was derived to quantitatively establish whether the timing of FXaα autoproteolysis supports the proposed fibrinolytic pathway. Furthermore, the potential influence of subform conversion on the acceleration of AT by heparin (15Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and the discrepancy in the literature regarding clotting activity (8Jesty J. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 509-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jesty J. Esnouf M.P. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Jesty J. Spencer A.K.

Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5290-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) were addressed by comparing homogeneous FXaα and FXaβ in unambiguous purified systems. The data presented here clearly show that FXaα must be the prevalent enzyme during the initial stages of thrombin generation, and excision of the β-peptide has no effect on inhibition by AT/heparin or prothrombinase assembly and activity. HEPES, para-aminobenzamidine (pAB) (Sigma), Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone (EGRck, Calbiochem), dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA, Haematologic Technologies, Inc.), heparin (5-kDa average molecular weight, Calbiochem), and benzoyl-Ile-Glu (piperidyl)-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanalide (S-2337, Helena) were obtained commercially. Bovine factor X (FX), prothrombin (17Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8977-8984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bajaj S.P. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7729-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and AT (19Thaler E. Schmer G. Br. J. Haematol. 1975; 31: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. Bovine FVa was commercially prepared (Haematologic Technologies) according to established protocols (20Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5714-5723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Krishnaswamy S. Williams E.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9684-9693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stable FXaα was generated by incubating factor X with the purified activator from Russell's viper venom (RVV, Haematologic Technologies) (22Jesty J. Nemerson Y. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.2 (HBS) at 37°C in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of the covalent inhibitor, EGRck (EGR-FXa) or 5 mM of the noncovalent inhibitor, pAB (pAB-FXa). Excess EGRck was removed by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration chromatography (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 25 mM citrate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 6.0. The EGR-FXaα was then loaded onto a DEAE-Cellulose (Whatman) column equilibrated in the same buffer to remove the RVV and was eluted by including 1.0 M NaCl. The RVV was separated from the pAB-FXaα in the same way except that all buffers contained 5 mM pAB, and the activation mixture was diluted 15-fold in start buffer and then loaded directly onto DEAE-Cellulose. The protein peak that eluted from DEAE-cellulose was concentrated by precipitation with 75% saturated ammonium sulfate and resuspended in a minimum volume of HBS (containing 5 mM pAB for the pAB-FXaα preparation). Any residual factor X and activation fragments were removed by Sephadex G-75 (Pharmacia) gel filtration chromatography in the same buffer. The protein elution peak containing EGR-FXaα was concentrated by 75% ammonium sulfate precipitation and resuspended in HBS, 50% glycerol for storage at −20°C. After the G-75 step, the pAB-FXaα was aliquoted and stored at −70°C directly after elution. To produce FXaβ, factor X was activated by treatment with RVV and isolated by benzamidine-Sepharose affinity chromatography (23Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quantitative conversion to FXaβ was achieved by dialysis at 0.5 mg/ml for 8 h in HBS, 2 mM Ca2+ at 22°C. FXaβ was then treated with a 100-fold molar excess of EGRck to produce EGR-FXaβ and subjected to G-25 chromatography as above. The complete inhibition of both FXa subforms (1.5 µM) by chloromethylketone was confirmed by the lack of detectable amidolytic activity (S-2337, 200 µM) using a kinetic microplate reader (Vmax, Molecular Devices) with full scale set to 0.03 optical density units over 15 min. EGR-FXa was radioiodinated using Iodogen (Pierce) and chromatographically desalted (Excellulose 5, Pierce) to remove unincorporated 125I. The homogeneity of all proteins was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207084) Google Scholar) and where applicable by autoradiography using X-Omat AR film (Kodak) and Quanta III intensifying screens (Dupont). Immediately prior to experimentation, all proteins were dialyzed (Spectropore 2 tubing, Spectrum Medical Industries) into HBS, or when pAB was to be used as a reporter group, the pAB-FXaα and FXaβ were dialyzed into HBS containing 80 µM pAB at 4°C. The molar concentration of proteins was determined spectrophotometrically using E0.1%280 nm values and molecular weights of 1.24 and 55,000 for factor X (25Jackson C.M. Hanahan D.J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8969-8977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for FVa; and 0.65 and 58,000 for AT (30Nordenman B. Nystrom C. Bjork I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The optical density at 280 nm was corrected for Rayleigh light scatter by subtracting 1.7 times the absorbance at 320 nm (31Brice B.A. Halwer M. J. Opt. Soc. Am. 1952; 41: 1033-1037Crossref Google Scholar). For chemically modified proteins or proteins containing pAB, the concentrations were measured colorimetrically using a cupric bicinchoninic acid detection system (BCA, Pierce) and confirmed by quantitative amino acid composition (by Dr. A. Kurosky, University of Texas at Galveston, Protein Chemistry Laboratory). The autoproteolytic subform conversion of FXaα was followed by densitometry of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) at 22°C, in HBS, 2 mM Ca2+. Four initial concentrations of FXaα were used either in the presence or absence of synthetic unilamellar phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% phosphatidylcholine and 25% phosphatidylserine (PCPS), and the data were globally fit to integrated rate laws that describe three kinetic models. α→kβα+α→kβ+βα+α→kα+β→kβ+βMODELS 1−3 Models 1 and 2 represent simple unimolecular and bimolecular reactions, respectively, where kis the rate constant and α and β are abbreviations for FXaα and FXaβ. Integration of the corresponding rate laws yield the equations (32Gutfreund H. Enzymes: Physical Principles. Wiley-Interscience, Toronto1972: 116Google Scholar), [β]t=[FXa]−1ekt(Eq. 1) and [β]t=[FXa]−1k+1/[FXa](Eq. 2) where [β]tis the concentration of FXaβ at any time (t) and [FXa] is the total concentration of FXaα plus FXaβ at t(i.e.for t = 0, [FXa] = [α]0). The third model includes FXaβ in addition to FXaα as an autoproteolytic enzyme in the reaction mixture and gives the following integrated rate law, assuming that the sequential rate constants are equal. [β]t=[FXa]−[FXa]e−k[FXa]t(Eq. 3) The interaction of pAB with FXaα or FXaβ was monitored by inhibition of amidolytic activity. In these experiments, four concentrations of chromogenic substrate S-2337 were combined with a range of pAB concentration (0.1-90 µM final) in a 96-well plate. The reaction was initiated by adding the appropriate FXa subform (4 nM final) in HBS containing 0.1% (w/v) PEG 8000. Color development (405 nm) was monitored at 5-s intervals using a kinetic microplate reader (Vmax, Molecular Devices) at room temperature. Initial reaction velocities were obtained by regression of the linear phase of the progress curves (usually the first 40 s). Inhibition constants (Ki) were derived by globally fitting the data to the conventional Michaelis equation describing competitive inhibition (32Gutfreund H. Enzymes: Physical Principles. Wiley-Interscience, Toronto1972: 116Google Scholar, 34Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar). The interaction of AT with either FXa subform was followed by the quenching of pAB fluorescence upon displacement from the serine protease active site, as previously reported (35Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5452-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, the concentrations of pAB-FXaα or pAB-FXaβ (0.2 µM), AT (0.4 µM) and pAB (80 µM) were kept constant in the presence of various concentrations of heparin (1-44 µM) in HBS. The reaction was initiated by the rapid manual addition of a small volume of AT. pAB fluorescence was continuously monitored in ratio mode using an SLM 8000c spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments), at 25°C with excitation and emission at 330 nm (bandpass, 4 nm) and 365 nm (bandpass, 8 nm), respectively. The fluorometer was modified to contain a temperature-regulated rhodamine reference turret. To reduce scattered light artifacts, buffer was filtered through a 0.45-µm membrane and proteins were centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 × g. The total reaction volume was 0.6 ml in a 0.5-cm cuvette. Initial reaction velocities at each concentration of heparin were obtained by regression of the linear phase of the fluorescence progress curves (first 60 s) and were corrected for the inhibitory effect of pAB by using the derived Ki values as described (35Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5452-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, we were restricted to amounts of protein and cofactor that gave sufficiently slow initial rates to be measured after manual mixing. The incorporation of EGR-FXa subforms into prothrombinase was followed by inhibition of thrombin production. In these experiments, the concentrations of active FXaβ (3 nM), FVa (3 nM), prothrombin (1.4 µM), and PCPS (0.6 µM) (2Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 222: 260-280Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were kept constant. Thrombin generation was continuously monitored by following the fluorescence enhancement of DAPA (3 µM) (36Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) at 25°C in HBS with a 2.0-ml total reaction volume and initiated by adding PCPS. Excitation and emission wavelengths were at 330 nm (bandpass 8 nm) and 565 nm (bandpass 16 nm), respectively. The maximum rate of prothrombinase activity was determined by regression of the initial linear region of each thrombin generation curve (first 60 s) at varying concentrations of EGR-FXaα or EGR-FXaβ. Scattered light artifacts were minimized with a 500-nm-long pass filter (Corion LL-500-S-V447) in the emission channel. To further reduce scattered light artifacts, proteins and buffer were treated as described above. To determine the effect of FXa subform conversion on prothrombinase activity, the rate of prothrombin activation by prothrombinase composed of either pAB-FXaα or pAB-FXaβ (1 nM), factor Va (1 nM), and PCPS (0.6 µM) was measured using DAPA as described above. In these experiments, the prothrombin concentration was varied. The technical difficulty in comparing the biochemistry of FXa subforms is the continuous autoproteolytic conversion of FXaα to FXaβ. This is especially true in the presence of procoagulant phospholipid, which accelerates the conversion. To avoid this complication, we prepared FXaα in the presence of EGRck, an irreversible active site inhibitor. The SDS-PAGE pattern of the resulting EGR-FXaα is shown in Fig. 1, lane 1. Treatment of the FXa in this way is useful to investigate certain macromolecular interactions but obviously precludes studies that depend directly on the active site. Therefore, to compare prothrombinase activity or the rate that AT associates with the active site of the FXa subforms, FXaα was prepared in the presence of pAB, which is a reversible serine protease inhibitor. Fig. 1, lane 3, shows the pAB-FXaα produced in this way. Both forms of stabilized FXaα exhibited less than 5% contaminating FXaβ. The production of homogeneous FXaβ from FXaα was complicated by additional autoproteolytic cleavages that are known to occur (12Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since these inhibit the procoagulant activity of FXa, the resulting products were not evaluated in the current studies. To produce FXaβ we found that the solution phase conversion of FXaα minimized further autoproteolysis, which at 0.5 mg/ml, 22°C, 2 mM Ca2+, and 8 h of incubation, approximately 95% is FXaβ. The preparation of FXaβ was accomplished while simultaneously dialyzing. This removed the β-peptide, as confirmed by NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the final product. As a positive control, the β-peptide was detectable if the subform conversion was done without dialysis. We found that preparation of human FXaβ is not practical by this method because further autoproteolytic processing was found to be approximately 5-fold faster compared with bovine FXaβ (data not shown). To establish the least complicated mechanism that adequately describes autoproteolytic FXaβ production, kinetic data were fit to integrated rate laws that describe three reaction mechanisms of increasing complexity. Fig. 2 compares the concordance of the data to these models in the absence (upper panels) and presence (lower panels) of PCPS. As can be seen, neither a first order (panels A and B, Model 1) nor a simple second order (panels C and D, Model 2) reaction satisfactorily represented the data. However, the kinetic data were fit well by the equation describing Model 3. The rate constants that were derived from the fit data were 9 and 172 M−1 s−1 in the absence and presence of excess PCPS, respectively. The rate of human FXaα autoproteolysis in the presence of PCPS (shown in the preceding paper, Fig. 2) was observed to be approximately the same as bovine FXaα. To provide experimental evidence in support of the two sequential rate constants being equivalent, which is implicit in Model 3, we followed the subform conversion of EGR-FXaα as a substrate at a single concentration. No difference in the kinetic profiles was observed when either catalytic amounts of FXaα or FXaβ were used as the enzyme (data not shown). The interaction of AT with the active site of FXa (35Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5452-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or thrombin (38Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1698-1708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using pAB as a fluorescent probe has been investigated extensively. These authors demonstrated that pAB is competitively displaced by AT, with subsequent fluorescence quenching being directly proportional to the amount of AT-protease complex that is formed. In the current work, we used the same signal to evaluate the rate of association of AT with pAB-FXaα or pAB-FXaβ at various concentrations of heparin. As an initial step it was necessary to establish whether the pAB bound equally to the two subforms. Presented in Fig. 3 are kinetic plots showing the effect of pAB on chromogenic substrate cleavage (S2337) by either FXaα or FXaβ. Ki values were derived by fitting the data to the Michaelis equation describing competitive inhibition (32Gutfreund H. Enzymes: Physical Principles. Wiley-Interscience, Toronto1972: 116Google Scholar) and yielded nearly identical values of 43 µM for FXaα and 38 µM for FXaβ (±15%). Therefore, differences in pAB binding to the FXa subforms would not be a variable in the experiments designed to measure the relative rate of pAB displacement by AT from FXaα or FXaβ. This confirmed that a direct comparison of AT·Xa subform complex formation measured by pAB fluorescence is valid. The somewhat lesser reaction velocities observed for FXaβ can be accounted for by the small amount of secondary autoproteolytic products that are contained within the FXaβ preparations, which are inactive (12Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These observations are in agreement with less rigorous studies, which showed that the amidolytic activity of FXaα and FXaβ was the same (8Jesty J. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 509-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amidolytic experiments were conducted in the absence of procoagulant phospholipid and at relatively low concentrations of FXaα. For these reasons, even at the lowest experimental concentration of inhibitor, pAB (1 µM), subform conversion of 125I-pAB-FXaα was not detected during the experiment (data not shown). To determine the effect of subform conversion on the heparin-dependent acceleration of AT-FXa binding, the amount of pAB-FXaα or pAB-FXaβ, AT, and pAB was held constant, while heparin was titrated at rate-limiting concentrations. The initial velocities plotted in Fig. 4 showed that the rates of FXa·AT complex formation are the same in the presence or absence of heparin for both FXa subforms. Therefore, the cofactor effect of heparin on inhibition of FXaα or FXaβ by AT is also equivalent. The apparent kcat/Km values derived from these data by the method of Craig et al. (35Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5452-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were 2.8 × 105 and 2.4 × 105M−1 s−1, respectively. It should be noted that the concentration of AT used by these authors to ensure that it was not limiting was 4-fold higher than in our experiments. Although the basic conclusion that FXaα and FXaβ associate equally with AT in the presence of heparin is valid, our values for Kcat/Km may be moderately underestimated. The incorporation of FXa subforms into prothrombinase complexes was evaluated using EGR-FXaα or EGR-FXaβ to inhibit thrombin generation by prothrombinase. Several other laboratories have demonstrated that the inhibition is competitive (2Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 222: 260-280Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In our experiments, FXaβ was selected as the active enzyme rather than FXaα to eliminate any variability we may have observed due to possible subform conversion of the functional enzyme. Fig. 5 compares the initial rate of thrombin generation at various concentrations of EGR-FXaα or EGR-FXaβ. The data revealed that the association of the two active site-blocked FXa subforms with FVa/PCPS, causing displacement and inhibition of the active FXaβ, is identical. The concentration required to achieve 50% inhibition was approximately 4 nM for both subforms. The similarity that we observed between the two subforms in the prothrombinase inhibition experiments may have been caused by the phospholipid-accelerated conversion of EGR-FXaα to EGR-FXaβ by the functional enzyme that was present. To investigate this possibility, a trace amount of 125I-EGR-FXaα was included in the reaction mixture containing the highest amount of EGR-FXaα (44 nM) and sampled over time for subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE. At each time point, the reaction was stopped by denaturation in Laemmli sample buffer containing SDS. The autoradiograph presented in Fig. 6 demonstrated that conversion does not take place over the course of the experiment (60 s) and was not significant until approximately 1 h of incubation. In separate experiments we ascertained that iodination was not inhibitory to subform conversion (data not shown). Having established that the equilibria governing prothrombinase assembly are independent of the FXa subform, we next determined if the ability to activate prothrombin was different. In these experiments, thrombin production by prothrombinase formed with either pAB-FXaα or pAB-FXaβ was monitored using DAPA at different concentrations of the substrate prothrombin. The FXa subforms were sufficiently diluted to make the inhibitory effect of residual pAB (10 nM) negligible. Fig. 7 shows the kinetic profiles used to derive apparent Km values of 1.2 µM for FXaα and 1.4 µM (± 15%) for FXaβ by nonlinear least squares fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. These values are higher than those previously reported (39Nesheim M.E. Tracy R.P. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1447-1453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemsley J.W.P. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may be complicated by the relatively low concentration of PCPS used in the assay. Nevertheless, the data are clearly consistent with the conclusion that conversion of FXaα to FXaβ does not significantly influence prothrombinase activity. To verify that the active FXaα was at an adequately low concentration to make subform conversion negligible over the time frame of the experiment (60 s), an identical parallel experiment was performed using radioiodinated FXaα at the highest and lowest concentrations of prothrombin. After electrophoresis and autoradiography of samples taken over 30 min we observed no generation of FXaβ (data not shown). This was found to be independent of prothrombin and FVa. In the current study, a mechanism describing the autoproteolytic conversion of FXaα to FXaβ was derived. The simplest kinetic model to satisfactorily fit the data was a sequential second order process and included FXaα and FXaβ as equivalent enzymes (see “Experimental Procedures,”Model 3). Experimental evidence that the reaction involved two molecules of FXa was first obtained by Jesty et al. (10Jesty J. Spencer A.K. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5614-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inhibited FXaα as a substrate for active FXa. We found that an identical model described the kinetic data either in the absence or presence of PCPS, with the latter being 20-fold faster. Compared with the generation of thrombin by prothrombinase, which occurred at approximately 6 nM thrombin/s (Fig. 5), the same concentration of FXaα in the presence of PCPS is expected (from Equation 3, at t = 60 s) to convert to FXaβ more slowly by 6 orders of magnitude. These conclusions were directly supported by simultaneously following subform conversion and prothrombinase activity in experiments using catalytic amounts of 125I-FXaα as the enzyme. The data revealed no generation of FXaβ, although significant thrombin was produced. The presence of FVa was not observed to affect the rate of FXaα autoproteolysis (data not shown). To our knowledge these are the first studies to demonstrate that FXaα is the prevalent enzymatic component of prothrombinase during the initial stages of thrombin production. In the preceding paper data are presented that show FXaβ but not FXaα is capable of functioning as a plasminogen receptor. Since the formation of plasminogen-FXa complexes is known to accelerate plasmin production by tPA (5Pryzdial E.L.G. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17871-17877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), autoproteolysis was suggested to provide a mechanism to initiate plasminogen activation directly at sites of prothrombinase assembly. The finding here that autoproteolytic generation of FXaβ is slow relative to thrombin production fits into this mechanism by coordinating the sequential expression of procoagulant and profibrinolytic activity. Given the slow relative rate of FXaα autoproteolysis compared with thrombin production by prothrombinase, one would predict that other possible regulatory functions for excision of the β-peptide (bovine, 2Numbering based on the amino acid sequence predicted from FX cDNA (33Messier T.L. Pittman D.D. Long G.L. Kaufman R.J. Church W.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). residues 433-449 (14Fujikawa K. Titani K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3359-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); human, residues 436-447 (41Eby C.S. Mullane M.P. Porche-Sorbet R.M. Miletich J.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 306Google Scholar)) would evolve to favor anticoagulant processes. This supposition was supported in the literature by the position of a heparin binding site on FXa that has been inferred from similarities to thrombin (15Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Through the introduction of point mutations (42Gan Z.-R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by chemical protection (43Church F.C. Pratt C.W. Noyes C.M. Kalayanamit T. Sherrill G.B. Tobin R.B. Meade J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18419-18425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), three basic amino acids near the COOH terminus of thrombin were previously identified. The latter two residues line up with basic residues in FXa (bovine, Lys416 and Arg420; human, Lys420 and Lys424) when comparing crystal structures (15Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FXa (bovine and human) contains several other flanking basic amino acids that may participate. Due to the proximity of these to the domain within FXaα corresponding to the β-peptide (β-domain), we hypothesized that subform conversion may influence heparin binding to FXa and consequently affect inhibition by AT. We therefore investigated the inactivation of FXa by AT in the presence of the cofactor heparin. Our experiments showed that FXaα and FXaβ form complexes with AT at the same rate. Moreover this similarity was not dependent on the concentration of heparin. Through the use of synthetic peptides corresponding to the FXa primary structure, a COOH-terminal heavy chain region that is conserved between species (bovine, residues 411-420; human, residues 415-424) has been shown to inhibit thrombin generation by prothrombinase (16Chattopadhyay A. James H.L. Fair D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12323-12329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nearness of this to the β-domain suggested that FXaα conversion may have an effect on prothrombinase function. Due to the slow relative rate of FXaβ production, we predicted that subform conversion may attenuate prothrombinase activity. To test this directly, we chemically inhibited the autoproteolysis of FXaα during experiments. The data showed that neither FXa·FVa·Ca2+·PCPS complex assembly nor recognition of prothrombin as a substrate was dependent on whether FXaα or FXaβ was present. This is an important consideration for the pharmacological development of FXa modified at the active site, which has been used as an effective anticoagulant (44Hollenbach S. Sinha U. Lin P.H. Needham K. Frey L. Hancock T. Wong A. Wolf D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 45Giardino E.C. Falotico R. Andrade-Gordon P. Kauffman J.A. Barrett J. Phillips D.R. Wolf D.L. Circulation. 1993; 4: 2240Google Scholar). Cumulatively, our observations are consistent with the β-domain of FXaα not participating in small substrate recognition, inhibition by AT/heparin, prothrombinase assembly, or prothrombin activation. These conclusions do not preclude the possibility that release of the β-peptide is associated with other procoagulant regulatory functions. As an example, a COOH-terminal region (bovine,2 residues 413-427; human, residues 417-431) has been connected with the recognition of the FXa precursor, FX, by the activating tenase enzymes (46Chattopadhyay A. Fair D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence that this process may be influenced by excision of the neighboring β-domain comes from studies that showed removal of the O-linked carbohydrate from human FX, which is contained exclusively in the β-domain (47Mizuochi T. Yamashita K. Fujikawa K. Titani K. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3526-3531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), decreases activation by tenase (48Sinha U. Wolf D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3048-3051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the possible relationship of FX subform conversion with activation.

PKC-δ is increased in cultured neural cells following chronic exposure to ethanol (20Messing R.O. Petersen P.J. Henrich C.J. J. Biol.

On the other hand, PKC-δ is decreased in peritoneal macrophages by nitric oxide (25Jun C.D. Choi B.M. Lee S.Y. Kang S.S. Kim H.M. Chung H.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23868-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In murine melanocytes, down-regulation of PKC-δ occurs by a post-translational mechanism without a detectable change in steady-state mRNA (14Brooks G. Goss M.W. East J.A. Hart I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23868-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).As described in this report, PKC-δ is also down-regulated by TPA in murine A20 B lymphoma cells; however, in these cells, a decrease in PKC-δ mRNA is observed. The mechanisms involve both a decrease in the rate of transcription and an increase in the rate of mRNA degradation. The post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism can be activated in vitro and appears to require de novo protein synthesis.RESULTSPKC-δ was found recently to be the most abundant isozyme in A20 cells (5Shih N.-Y. Floyd-Smith G. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To determine if PKC-δ was activated and then down-regulated by TPA, anti-PKC-δ antibody was used to detect PKC-δ at various times following exposure to TPA (Fig. 1). At zero time, two forms of PKC-δ, which are likely to correspond to two major phosphorylation variants (7Ohno S. Mizuno K. Adachi Y. Hata A. Akita Y. Akimoto K. Osada S. Hirai S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17495-17501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were detected primarily in the cytosol. The addition of a competitor peptide (amino acids 662–673 of PKC-δ) specifically blocked binding of the antibody to both forms. Following TPA treatment, about 50% of the total PKC-δ translocated to the membrane fraction within 10 min and was retained there for at least 18 h (Fig. 1A). An increase in the proportion of PKC-δ exhibiting decreased electrophoretic mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels was also seen in the cytosol. PKC was activated as indicated by increased phosphorylation of the 80-kDa myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate and induction of c-fos (see 5Shih N.-Y. Floyd-Smith G. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Down-regulation of PKC-δ was seen in both the cytosol and membrane fractions 6–24 h post-treatment. Complete down-regulation was not, however, seen in the cytosol even after a 48-h treatment (data not shown). Since several PKC isozymes were found previously to be down-regulated rapidly by TPA-induced proteolysis (14Brooks G. Goss M.W. East J.A. Hart I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23868-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Rodriguez-Pena A. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 1987; 7: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the amount of PKC-δ in control and TPA-treated cells was determined in the presence or absence of the translational inhibitor, cycloheximide (Fig. 1B). In the presence of cycloheximide, PKC-δ decreased by 30% for control cells, whereas a 65% decrease was seen for TPA-treated cells at 24 h, indicating that protein turnover was greater following TPA treatment. A 90% decrease in PKC-δ over 24 h was, however, seen in the absence of cycloheximide, which suggested that TPA was reducing production of PKC-δ as well as increasing its degradation.To determine if PKC-δ mRNA levels were down-regulated, Northern blots of RNA from control and TPA-treated cells were analyzed (Fig. 2). PKC-δ mRNA was decreased within 15 min following treatment and was reduced to 14% of the control within 4 h. Steady-state PKC-δ mRNA remained low for 12 h, then gradually increased 12–48 h post-treatment to the control level.Fig. 2Down-regulation of PKC-δ mRNA by TPA. A20 cells at a density of 2–3 × 106 cells/ml were incubated without (C) or with 100 ng/ml TPA for the designated times. Expression of PKC-δ and GAPDH mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel A, time course for expression of PKC-δ and GAPDH mRNA.

No change was observed in the transcription rate for PKC-α which was expressed at a low level. When compared with the constitutively expressed GAPDH, a 50% decrease in the transcription rate for PKC-δ was seen 2–24 h post-treatment (Fig. 3B). The transcription rate returned to pretreatment levels after 48 h (data not shown).Fig. 3Nuclear run-off transcription of PKC-δ in control and TPA-treated cells. Panel A, 1 × 108 A20 cells were incubated in control medium (C) or medium containing 100 ng/ml TPA for the indicated times. Nuclear run-off assays were done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Radiolabeled PKC-α, PKC-δ, and GAPDH (constitutively expressed control) transcripts were detected by autoradiography for 12 days with an intensifying screen. Panel B, intensity of autoradiogram exposure was measured by densitometry, and the ratio of PKC-α to GAPDH (striped bar) and PKC-δ to GAPDH (open bar) was determined for the indicated times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TPA treatment also destabilized PKC-δ mRNA; however, in contrast to transcriptional down-regulation, this mechanism required ongoing mRNA and protein synthesis (Fig. 4). When actinomycin D was added 2 h following TPA treatment, the half-life for PKC-δ mRNA was more than 180 min in control cells and 50 min in TPA-treated cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Accelerated degradation of PKC-δ mRNA was also seen when 10 µg/ml cycloheximide and actinomycin D were simultaneously added 2 h after TPA treatment (data not shown). Accelerated degradation of PKC-δ mRNA could not, however, be detected if actinomycin D was added 20 min prior to TPA treatment (Fig. 4A). Likewise, the stability of PKC-δ mRNA was unaffected by TPA in cells pretreated with cycloheximide and assayed in the presence of actinomycin D 2–6 h after TPA or control treatments (Fig. 4D). The 50% transcriptional down-regulation was unaffected by the addition of cycloheximide (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4Effect of TPA on stability of PKC-δ mRNA. Panel A, Northern blot analysis of PKC-δ and GAPDH mRNA from cells incubated for 20 min with actinomycin D prior to control or TPA treatment. Panel B, Northern blot analysis of PKC-δ and GAPDH mRNA from cells incubated with or without 100 ng/ml TPA for 2 h followed by incubation of 10 µg/ml actinomycin D for the designated times. Panel C, the relative intensity of the autoradiogram shown in panel B was quantified by densitometry, and the ratio of PKC-δ to GAPDH was determined. The percent of the value obtained at 0 h was set at 100% for control cells (▪) or cells treated with TPA (•). The data are representative of three independent experiments. Panel D, cells were incubated for 10 min with 15 µg/ml cycloheximide before control (▪) or TPA (•) treatment. Two h after control or TPA treatment, actinomycin D was added, and total RNA was isolated at the indicated times following actinomycin D addition. Northern blots were quantified by densitometry, and the ratio of PKC-δ to GAPDH was determined. The inset shows the relative percentage of PKC-δ mRNA remaining at the indicated times over the amount detected at zero time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The stability of PKC-δ mRNA was also assayed using the pulse-chase method (Fig. 5). In this assay, TPA treatment decreased the half-life of PKC-δ mRNA from > 8 h to 160 min. The longer half-lives calculated using the pulse-chase method were due in part to destabilization of PKC-δ mRNA by actinomycin D. When actinomycin D was added to cells, 50.8% of the [3H]uridine-labeled PKC-δ mRNA was degraded within 6 h compared with 24.6% in the absence of actinomycin D (data not shown). The measured half-lives of other mRNAs have also been found to be longer using the pulse-chase method compared with Northern blot analysis following the addition of actinomycin D (47Ferry R.C. Unsworth C.D. Artymyshyn R.P. Molinoff P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31850-31857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In any case, both assays reveal destabilization of PKC-δ mRNA by TPA.Fig. 5PKC-δ mRNA stability as determined by the pulse-chase method. Cells were prelabeled with [5,6-3H]uridine and then incubated with 100 ng/ml TPA (•) or without TPA (▪). Total cellular RNA was purified, and radioactive PKC-δ mRNA was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is expressed as the relative percent of mRNA and is the mean of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TPA-treated cells were found to contain an activity that destabilized PKC-δ mRNA in vitro but did not affect the stability of GAPDH mRNA (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). The addition of extracts from control cells to reaction mixtures containing deproteinated RNA did not destabilize PKC-δ mRNA, whereas postnuclear or nuclear extracts from TPA-treated cells increased PKC-δ mRNA degradation. A 50% decrease in the ratio of PKC-δ to GAPDH mRNA was seen when RNA was incubated in reaction mixtures containing 2.7% postnuclear extract (3.5 mg/ml protein) from TPA-treated cells, whereas no decrease was seen when incubated with 2.7% postnuclear extract (3.4 mg/ml) from control cells. Likewise, incubation of RNA with 12% nuclear extract (1.8 mg/ml) from control cells did not alter the ratio of PKC-δ to GAPDH mRNA, whereas 12% nuclear extract (1.7 mg/ml protein) from TPA-treated cells resulted in a 40% decrease in the ratio of PKC-δ to GAPDH mRNA. Divalent cations were required, since addition of 50 mM EDTA blocked degradation of PKC-δ mRNA in TPA-treated extracts (data not shown). These data suggest that component(s) required for selective degradation of PKC-δ mRNA were found primarily in the cytosol.Fig. 6Degradation of PKC-δ mRNA in vitro. Cells were incubated without (Control) or with 100 ng/ml of TPA for 4 h. In vitro RNA degradation assays containing the indicated percentage of either postnuclear (panel A) or nuclear (panel B) extracts were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Incubation with 10 mM vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (V) or without 20 µg of RNA (−R) is indicated. PKC-δ and GAPDH mRNAs were detected by Northern blot analysis and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Effects of TPA and PKC inhibitors on PKC-δ mRNA degradation in vitro and in vivo. Panel A, postnuclear extract from control cells was incubated with 10 mM vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (V), with 20 µM chelerythrine chloride (Ch), and the indicated concentration of added TPA at 4°C for 30 min. PKC-δ and GAPDH mRNAs were detected by Northern blot analysis and autoradiography. Panel B, cells were treated for 2 or 4 h with TPA as indicated or alternatively treated for 2 h with TPA followed by 2 h with the indicated concentration of calphostin C (CC). Densitometry was used to quantify PKC-δ and GAPDH mRNA. The relative percentage of mRNA detected at the 2-h TPA treatment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PKC-δ mRNA destabilization required treatment of intact cells with TPA. The addition 1–100 ng/ml TPA to control lysates failed to increase degradation of PKC-δ mRNA, and addition of the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine chloride (48Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar) had no effect in the in vitro assay (Fig. 7A). TPA-induced degradation of PKC-δ mRNA appeared to be mediated through activation of PKC since addition of calphostin C, a highly specific PKC inhibitor (49Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), to TPA-treated cells partially blocked degradation of PKC-δ mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7B). Taken together, these data show that down-regulation of PKC-δ occurred as a result of several mechanisms that include increased protein turnover, decreased mRNA stability, and transcriptional repression.DISCUSSIONActivation of PKC is generally correlated with phosphorylation and translocation to cell membranes (for review, see 1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar and 2Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). In A20 cells, some PKC-δ is translocated to the membrane fraction; however, most remains in the cytosol following activation by TPA. This is in contrast to the rapid and almost complete translocation of PKC-δ in NIH 3T3 cells (13Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two forms of PKC-δ are detected by Western blot analysis, and a relative increase in one form of PKC-δ, which has a slower electrophoretic mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, is seen after TPA treatment. These data are consistent with previous reports showing phosphorylation of PKC-δ upon activation (7Ohno S. Mizuno K. Adachi Y. Hata A. Akita Y. Akimoto K. Osada S. Hirai S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17495-17501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Li W. Mischak H. Yu J.C. Wang L.M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the time course and mechanisms appear to be variable. In melanocytic cells, down-regulation is primarily due to proteolysis with little effect on PKC-δ synthesis (14Brooks G. Goss M.W. East J.A. Hart I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23868-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in A20 cells increased proteolysis and decreased synthesis of PKC-δ both occur. TPA-activated mechanisms that decrease transcription and PKC-δ mRNA half-life contribute significantly to down-regulation. Down-regulation of PKC mRNA by TPA has not been seen by others who have reported only post-translational down-regulation of conventional PKCs (44Rodriguez-Pena A. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 45Young S. Parker P.J. Ullrich A. Stabel S. Biochem.

Goss M.W. East J.A. Hart I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23868-23875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional/translational regulatory mechanisms in A20 cells are therefore likely to be part of a regulatory system that may not be present in all cell types.TPA has been well characterized as an agent that modulates transcription through activation of AP-1 (for review, see 50Karin M.

Another PKC isozyme, PKC-β, has been found to have AP-1 binding sites in a region that negatively regulates cell type-specific transcription in transient transfection assays (56Niino Y.S. Ohno S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6158-6163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid transcriptional down-regulation of PKC-δ, which is not inhibited by cycloheximide, is consistent with activation of a preexisting transcription factor by TPA.In recent years the importance of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms has become recognized widely (for review, see 57Belasco J.G.

Destabilization of PKC-δ mRNA contributes significantly to the overall decrease in PKC-δ mRNA 2–24 h following TPA treatment in A20 cells. In control cells, PKC-δ mRNA is relatively stable with a half-life of more than 8 h which is reduced to 160 min in TPA-treated cells as determined using the [3H]uridine pulse-chase method. TPA-induced degradation of PKC-δ mRNA is also observed when transcription is blocked by actinomycin D; however, the stability of PKC-δ mRNA is generally decreased by actinomycin D. Others have also observed destabilization of mRNAs by actinomycin D (47Ferry R.C. Unsworth C.D. Artymyshyn R.P. Molinoff P.B. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1972179081,"The lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2a is implicated in B cell-specific transcriptional activity via the octamer motif. Structure/function analysis of various Oct-2a effector regions in the context of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain revealed that Oct-2a contains two functionally different activation domains at the N and the C termini. The transcriptional activity of both domains is strongly potentiated by interactions with distinct B cell-specific coactivators. Recently, we have identified a repression domain located within the N terminus of Oct-2a (amino acids 2–99). When this domain was transferred to a potent activator, transcription was strongly inhibited. In this study we present a deletion analysis of the N-terminal region of Oct-2a to determine the minimal repression domain. We identified a stretch of 23 amino acids, rich in serine and threonine residues, which was responsible for most of the repression activity. We show that repression is strongly dependent on the type of enhancer present in the reporter plasmid as well as on the cell line tested. The possibility that Oct-2a can act as an activator and/or a repressor may have important consequences for the function of Oct-2a in B cell differentiation and other developmental processes."

The filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus (Leuckart 1893), the causative agent of river blindness, infects an estimated 20 million humans who inhabit equatorial Africa, Central America, and Yemen (1World Health Organization Expert Committee, Onchocerciasis Third Report. World Health Organization, Geneva1987Google Scholar). The infective larvae (L3) are transmitted to the human host by a female blackfly of the simulium species (2Blacklock D.B. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1926; 20: 1-48Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In their final host the larvae undergo two molting steps and develop into an adult worm. The adult female worms of O. volvulus, which reside within nodules for periods of more than 10 years produce microfilariae that are for the most part responsible for pathogenesis of the disease (3Greene B.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and 4Bianco A.E. Macpherson C.N.L. Craig P.S. Parasite Helminths and Zoonoses in Africa. Unwin Hyman, London1991: 138Google Scholar and references therein). It is of considerable interest to identify genes of the filarial nematode O. volvulus that are expressed at critical stages of the life cycle and during development (4Bianco A.E. Macpherson C.N.L. Craig P.S. Parasite Helminths and Zoonoses in Africa. Unwin Hyman, London1991: 138Google Scholar). Parasite transcription factors with likely functions in parasite development and differentiation are ideal candidates for stage-specifically regulated genes. Upon identification of such putatively regulatory molecules it is of interest to study their pattern of expression during parasite development. The infective larva L3 is of particular interest, as this form is expected to express or secrete factors that allow the larvae to adjust to the physiological conditions provided by the mammalian host. Little is known about early development of O. volvulus, and to our knowledge no factors have yet been identified that play a regulatory role in parasite development. The characterization of these regulatory molecules is important for the understanding of physiological events involved in parasite development. Such regulatory proteins expressed in the infective L3 larvae are also of particular immunological interest, since upon infection and entry into the human host they are directly presented to the immune system. We are interested in identifying and characterizing genes of O. volvulus that play a regulatory role in parasite development.

Expression was detected in the infective L3 larvae but not in the adult female worm. The corresponding Ovzf-1 protein has two unusual features; it includes a novel finger-like domain, which has the two conserved Cys residues replaced by Ser residues, and it possesses an N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide that is capable of directing the expression of a reporter protein via the secretory pathway. A genomic λ fix II library prepared from adult female O. volvulus was screened using a 507-bp fragment (representing nucleotides 756-1262) of the previously described O. volvulus zinc finger gene fragment ovzf-1 (10Holst C.

Freshly excised nodules from onchocerciasis patients in Benin, West Africa, were incubated in 0.5% collagenase A (Boehringer Mannheim, FRG) in RPMI medium at 30°C for 8-36 h. Intact motile worms were prepared as described (13Schulz-Key H. Albiez E.J. Büttner D.W. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1977; 28: 428-430Google Scholar), and the isolated worms were immediately frozen in liquid N2. Twenty-six O. volvulus adult female worms were thawed in lysis buffer A (60% guanidinethiocyanate, 0.5% N-laurylsarcosine, 50 mM lithium citrate, 0.5%β-mercaptoethanol) and immediately homogenized using a glass homogenizer. Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 20 min. (Beckman J2-21, rotor JA-20). The supernatant was layered on top of a CsCl gradient (3.0-5.7 M CsCl in 100 mM Na2 EDTA) and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 22 h at 20°C (Beckman L8-70M, rotor SW55). The RNA pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of double-distilled H2O, and the yield was determined photometrically at 260 nm. The purity of the RNA was verified by ethidium bromide staining following agarose gel electrophoresis (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). All solutions were prepared with DEPC-treated double-distilled H2O. cDNA was synthesized from O. volvulus adult female RNA, using oligo(dT) (25 µg/ml, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and reverse transcriptase (RT superscript, Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The specific primers Cov7 (5′-ATGCTGCTGCTTTATTACTCTGTA-3′, positions 49-72) and Cov25 (5′-GCCGCACACATCGCACTTGAACAG-3′, positions 903-880) and Cov7 and Cov9 (5′-TTTACCACATATATTGCATTTGAA-3′, positions 990-967), respectively, were employed in PCR reactions using cDNA prepared from adult worms and third stage larvae (provided by Dr. K. D. Erttmann, Bernhard Nocht Institute) as template (Fig. 1). Positions of oligonucleotides refer to the ovzf-2B-sequence (Fig. 4B). Two rounds of PCR amplification were performed, each consisting of 25 cycles (95°C for 1 min, 48°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min for the first round and 55°C annealing temperature during the second round) yielding clones ovzf-2A and ovzf-2B, respectively. Primer Cov8 (5′-GCGATGCATAATGGCAGTATAACT-3′, positions 98-75) and the phage-specific T3 primer were used to amplify a 48-bp 5′-untranslated fragment of ovzf-2 from the same cDNA source. The OvGST1 control fragment was amplified with oligonucleotides Gst-938 and Gst-967, provided by Dr. E. Liebau, Bernhard Nocht Institute. The PCR products were separated in a 1% agarose gel and were further subcloned into the pCR™ II vector (Invitrogen).Fig. 4Domain structure of the O. volvulus zinc finger protein-1 (Ovzf-1). The signal peptide is indicated by an orange box, and the N- and C-terminal domains are indicated by blue boxes. The structure of the finger domains is indicated. B, nucleotide sequence of the L3 cDNA amplificate ovzf-2. The nucleotide sequence of the L3 amplificate ovzf-2B includes 48 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence and an open reading frame of 942 bp. This open reading frame encodes the signal peptide, 34 amino acids, and a stretch of 91/2 contiguous finger domains. Again, the first finger-like domain has the conserved Cys residues replaced with Ser residues. C, amino acid sequence comparison of the Ovzf-1 and Ovzf-2 proteins. The individual domains of the two proteins are aligned, and identical amino acids are shown by dots. The conserved Cys/Ser and His residues of the finger domains are shown in boldface letters, and the predicted N-linked glycosylation sites are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The entire 942-bp ovzf-2B cDNA fragment was reamplified by PCR, using primers Cov7exp (5′-tttTATAATATGCTGCTGCTTTATTACTCTGTAGC-3′, nucleotide positions 49-74) and Cov9exp (tttTTTACCACA TATATTGCATTTGAATTTTTG-3′, positions 990-961). Unspecific nucleotides are shown in lowercase letters, and BglII and SmaI restriction sites are underlined (nucleotide positions refer to the ovzf-2B sequence; see Fig. 4) The PCR product was digested with BglII and SmaI and ligated into the BglII/SmaI-cleaved baculovirus expression vector pBSV-8His (12Kühn S. Zipfel P.F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), yielding the expression construct ovzf-2exp. A functional assay was developed to analyze whether the hydrophobic N-terminal region of the Ovzf-2 protein can direct protein expression via the secretory pathway. The human actor -ike plasma protein 1 (FHL-1) (15Kristensen T. Wetsel R.A. Tack B.F. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 3407-3411PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 121-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) is expressed in the baculovirus system as a secreted protein (17Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an expression construct was created in which the region representing the FHL-1 signal peptide was replaced with the sequence encoding the N-terminal region of Ovzf-2. A 54-bp fragment coding for the Ovzf-2 hydrophobic region (Ov-SP, nucleotides 49-102) was amplified with primers Cov7exp and Cov3exp (5′-tttCTGTGCGATGCATGATGGCAAAATAACT-3′, representing positions 102-75; the PstI restriction site is underlined). This PCR fragment was used to replace the nucleotides encoding the signal peptide of FHL-1 (17Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar), yielding expression plasmid Ov-SP/H. In order to recombinantly express a truncated fragment of the Ovzf-1 protein encoding the N-terminal finger domains I-III, the ovzf-1t expression fragment was generated. The second exon of ovzf-1 was PCR-amplified with primers Cov51exp (5′-tttATATCAAATGAAAATGATCCACCAGTGC-3′, positions 114-141) and Cov9exp and subsequently cleaved with PstI (underlined in Cov51exp) and EcoRI (using the internal EcoRI site at positions 492-497 of the ovzf-1 sequence (Fig. 2)). The 381-bp ovzf-1t fragment was ligated into the PstI/EcoRI-cleaved pBSV-8His vector, downstream of the 54-bp sequence encoding the Ovzf-2 signal peptide. Spodoptera frugiperda intestinal cells (Sf9) were grown in monolayer cultures in Grace's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), and fungizone (250 ng/ml), at 27°C and 95% humidity. Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus were grown in serum-free X-Press medium (BioWhittaker), supplemented with antibiotics. Plasmid DNA used for transfection of insect cells was purified using Nucleobond AX cartridges (Macherey & Nagel). Sf9 cells were cotransfected with 0.25 µg of viral DNA (BaculoGOLD, Pharmingen) and 2 µg of plasmid DNA employing a calcium phosphate precipitation method modified for insect cells (18Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 10-35Google Scholar). After 4 h the cells were washed, and 3 ml of medium were added. Infected cells were incubated for at least 7 days. For expression of recombinant protein 1 × 107 Sf9 cells growing in 140-mm cell culture dishes (Nunc) were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5. In a positive control, Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant virus that represents the signal peptide and the secreted FHL-1 protein (H-SP/H) (17Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar). Four days after infection, recombinant proteins were analyzed in the cell culture supernatant, and Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer C (0.1 M NaH2PO4, 1 M urea, pH 8.0), supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (1 µg/ml each of antipain dihydrochloride, aprotinin, leupeptin (all Boehringer Mannheim), chymostatin, trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, elastinal (all Sigma), and Na2-EDTA) and homogenized in a glass homogenizer at 4°C. For concentration of recombinant Ovzf-2exp- and Ovzf-1t the proteins in the cell culture medium were precipitated with 80% cold aceton, washed in 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 10% volume of lysis buffer C. Secreted recombinant proteins were purified from the culture medium by nickel chelate chromatography as described previously (12Kühn S. Zipfel P.F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were plated and infected as described above. Twenty-four hours postinfection, the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh X-Press medium, which included 2 µg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma). The cells and the cell culture medium were harvested 3 days after tunicamycin treatment. Both the cell pellet and the concentrated cell culture medium were resuspended in 0.1 culture volume of lysis buffer C. Proteins were separated on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206926) Google Scholar) and were visualized either by staining with Coomassie G (20Mayer R.J. Walker J.H. Immunochemical Methods in Cell and Molecular Biology: Biological Techniques Series. Academic Press Limited; Harcourt Brace Janovic, London, San Francisco, NY, Berkeley, Boston, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto1987Google Scholar) or by silver staining (21Heuckeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1986; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). In addition, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes by a semi-dry technique (22Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) dried milk in PBS for 30 min and incubated overnight with rabbit antiserum. Recombinant Ovzf proteins were detected by Western blotting using rabbit antiserum α-46 at a dilution of 1:100. This antiserum had been raised against a synthetic peptide that represents an N-terminal fragment of the Ovzf-2exp protein (NH2-YARITDQLEQKNDTKELDVI-COOH, amino acid positions 29-47) (Eurogentec, Belgium). For detection of the fusion protein OV-SP/H and the control protein H-SP/H, antiserum raised against the human factor H-like protein 1 was used at a dilution of 1:2000 (17Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar). After washing in PBS, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled swine anti-rabbit IgG (1:400) (Dako) for 3 hours. Protein bands were visualized by the addition of 0.3% (w/v) 4-chloro-1-naphthol and 0.03% (v/v) H2O2 in 10% methanol (v/v) in PBS. Proteins derived from the cell culture medium of ovzf-1t-infected Sf9 cells were acetone-precipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For detection of glycosylated recombinant Ovzf-1t protein rabbit α-46 antiserum and the DIG-Glycan differentiation kit (Boehringer Mannheim) were employed. Sf9 cells were grown in serum-free X-Press medium on 13-mm cover slides (Sartstedt) and infected with recombinant ovzf-2exp baculovirus. After 3 days, cells adhering to the cover slides were washed in PBS and fixed in cold methanol for 3 min. The slides were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of antiserum α-46 in PBS for 1 h, washed extensively in PBS (3 × 5 min) and were then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) (1:200 in PBS) for 1 h. For staining of the nuclei, 50 ng of propidium iodide were added together with the second antibody. The slides were washed in PBS and embedded in Mowiol (12% (w/v) Mowiol 4-88 (Hoechst) in 30% (w/v) glycerol, 30% (v/v) double-distilled H20, 60% (v/v) 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). In order to isolate the complete gene encoding the O. volvulus zinc finger protein 1 (ovzf-1) (10Holst C. Zipfel P.F. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1993; 44: 147-151PubMed Google Scholar) a genomic library prepared from adult female O. volvulus worms was screened with an ovzf-1 probe. Three distinct clones were isolated. The genomic fragments representing the ovzf-1 gene were subcloned, and their nucleotide sequence was determined. The structure of the ovzf-1 gene is shown in Fig. 1. The organization of ovzf-1 was confirmed by comparison of the genomic sequence with that of a cDNA clone isolated from L3 larvae (ovzf-2, see below). The cDNA has the intron deleted, and exons 1 and 2 are spliced together. The nucleotide sequence of the ovzf-1 gene is shown in Fig. 2. The ovzf-1 gene is organized into two exons, which are separated by a single intron. This intron with a length of approximately 1 kilobase pair is located between nucleotide positions 113 and 114 of the processed mRNA. The 5′ and 3′ sequences of the intron show a good match with the consensus sites for splice donor and splice acceptor of nematode introns (23Hammond M.P. Bianco A.E. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 299-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Table I). A comparison with the consensus site for the transcription initiation element INR (YYCYYYYY) (24Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar) identifies a good match (eight out of nine nucleotides) with the predicted transcription start site of ovzf-1 mRNA (TCCCTTCA). Consequently, the A residue in this sequence is designated the transcription start site (+1). The isolated ovzf-2 cDNA clone starts at position +10, indicating that the identified genomic region includes the transcription start site and the promoter element of the ovzf-1 gene (Fig. 4). The presence of a TATA-like box (AATAATT) at positions −28 to −22 (25Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3296) Google Scholar) and of a CCAAT box at positions −88 to −84 (26Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) is in agreement with the predicted transcription start site. Thus, the nucleotide sequence of the isolated ovzf-1 gene includes 240 bp of the promoter region.Table IConservation of splice acceptor and splice donor sites of the ovzf-1 gene5′ exonintron3′ exon# CAG ↓#GTAACATTTC AG ↓#Aovzf-1(G/A)AG ↓#GTAAGTTTT(C/T)AG ↓#GConsensus Open table in a new tab The 3′ end of the open reading frame is identified by an in-frame stop-codon (TGA) at positions 1401-1403. The sequence ATTAAA in positions 1701-1706 (underlined in Fig. 2), which is located 300 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon, may represent the polyadenylation signal of the ovzf-1 transcript (27Berget S.M. Nature. 1984; 309: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Manley J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The sequence downstream from this putative polyadenylation signal contains a T-rich (23 out of 24, positions 1746-1769) and A-rich stretch of nucleotides (18 out of 21, positions 1800-1820). Such complementary nucleotide stretches are likely regions for base pairing and secondary mRNA structure formation (30Hehl A. Vassella E. Braun R. Roditi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Upon splicing of the intron the ovzf-1 gene encodes an open reading frame of 447 amino acids. Exon 1, which includes the translation initiation codon at position 60, encodes 18 mostly hydrophobic amino acids, and exon 2 encodes 429 amino acids followed by the stop codon at positions 1401-1403. The resulting gene product has a calculated molecular mass of 53.3 kDa. Hydrophobicity analysis of the 18 amino acids encoded by exon 1 revealed a pattern indicative of a signal peptide (31von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 32von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Ovzf-1 protein is expressed via the secretory pathway. The amino acid sequence encoded by exon 2 of ovzf-1 represents 12 Krüppel-like contiguous zinc finger motifs of the type Cys2-His2 (9Rosenberg U.B. Schröder C. Preiss A. Kienlin A. Côté S. Riede J. Jäckle H. Nature. 1986; 319: 336-339Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These conserved Cys- and His- residues have been shown to bind zinc ions, thus forming a finger-like structure. Similar zinc finger domains have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and were found in several nucleic acid binding proteins (5Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 6Müller H.-J. Skerka C. Bialonski A. Zipfel P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33El-Baradi T. Pieler T. Mech. Dev. 1991; 35: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The first finger-like domain of the Ovzf-1 protein (amino acid positions 53-74) has the two Cys residues replaced with Ser residues. With this exception, this domain displays several characteristics reported for Cys2-His2 zinc finger structures (Fig. 2): the spacing of 12 amino acids between the second “Cys” (Ser) and the first His residue and the conservation of a Phe and a Leu residue at positions 4 and 10 of the finger domain (5Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 33El-Baradi T. Pieler T. Mech. Dev. 1991; 35: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) as well as a Glu and a Lys residue (positions 3 and 7) of the linker region separating two adjacent finger domains (H-C-link) (34Schuh Aicher W. Gaul U. Côté S. Preiss A. Maier D. Seifert E. Nauber U. Schröder C. Kemler R. Jäckle H. Cell. 1986; 47: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Thus, this first domain is likely to form a finger structure as well. The schematic structure of the Ovzf-1 zinc finger protein is shown in Fig. 4A. The N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide is followed by a stretch of 34 amino acids, 13 finger-like domains each consisting of 28-30 amino acids, and a C-terminal stretch of 32 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of the individual domains predicted for the Ovzf-1 protein are shown in Fig. 4C. The ovzf-1 product represents an unusual protein; the hydrophobic pattern of the N-terminal region, which is encoded on a separate exon, is indicative of a secreted protein, whereas the presence of several contiguous zinc finger domains suggests a nucleic acid binding protein, which most likely is contained in the cell nucleus. The expression of O. volvulus zinc finger genes was analyzed by Northern blotting and by RT-PCR. ovzf mRNA was not detected in RNA prepared from adult female worms. By Northern blot analysis no specific signal was detected even upon extended exposure (data not shown). The application of RT-PCR increased the sensitivity of detection; however, again no ovzf transcript was detected in cDNA prepared from adult worms, even after two rounds of PCR amplification (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). However, expression of the OvGST1 mRNA (35Liebau E. Walter R.D. Henkle-Dührsen K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was detected in RNA prepared from adult female O. volvulus (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). Since zinc finger proteins play an important role in cell differentiation and development, we analyzed expression of zinc finger genes in the infectious third larval stage of O. volvulus (L3). Using primers specific for ovzf-1, a unique 855-nucleotide fragment was amplified from reverse transcribed L3 mRNA, indicating stage specific expression of ovzf mRNA (Fig. 3, lane 5). The identity of this L3-derived fragment (ovzf-2A) was verified by demonstrating the existence of the internal EcoRI site at positions 492-497 (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, lane 6) and by sequence analysis. With a different pair of ovzf-1-derived primers, an additional 942-bp fragment was amplified from the same L3 cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of this ovzf-2B fragment is shown in Fig. 4B. The sequence is distinct but highly related to that of ovzf-1. In the overlapping region of ovzf-1 and ovzf-2, the identity is 89% on the nucleotide level and 87.3% on the amino acid level, whereas the sequences of ovzf-2A and ovzf-2B are identical in their overlapping 855 nucleotides (positions 49-903). Similar to the predicted Ovzf-1 protein, the product of ovzf-2 also possesses a hydrophobic signal peptide and an unusual first finger domain. A homology comparison of the two related proteins Ovzf-1 and Ovzf-2 is shown in Fig. 4C. Within the predicted amino acid sequence of the Ovzf-1 protein, six potential N-linked glycosylation sites of the type NX(S/T) were found at positions 39-41 (NDT), 71-73 (NET), 151-153 (NLS), 156-158 (NKT), 243-245 (NKT), and 328-330 (NKT) (36Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631"
