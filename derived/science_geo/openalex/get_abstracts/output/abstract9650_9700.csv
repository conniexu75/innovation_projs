https://openalex.org/W2051382273,"Abstract This report describes a method of marking nerve cells which is approximately 100 times more sensitive than those previously available. The method depends upon intracellular injection of a new, highly fluorescent dye, Lucifer Yellow CH, which can be viewed both in living tissue and after fixation and embedding. The intense fluorescence of the dye makes injected neurons visible in cleared wholemounts, where the complex three-dimensional structure of neurons is readily apparent. Three new observations have been made with Lucifer Yellow. First, many of the invertebrate neurons studied possess an extensive and complex array of fine processes not visible with other techniques. Second, dye spreads rapidly within an injected cell. Third, dye frequently spreads from the injected cell directly to certain other cells. The movement of dye from cell to cell, termed dye-coupling, occurred primarily, but not exclusively, between cells known to be electrically coupled. Dye-coupling in the turtle retina revealed striking and distinctive patterns of connections. Type I horizontal cells appear to be multiply connected to each other in an extensive net. Type II horizontal cells are often connected to each other in a hexagonal array. Individual type I and type II cells, widely separated, are frequently dye-coupled; in one case, they were connected by a dyefilled axon. Dye-coupling, readily observed because of the low molecular weight and the intense fluorescence of the new dye, may serve as a general method of tracing certain functional connections by morphological means, and of studying the transfer of small molecules between cells. Preliminary results suggest that systems of dye-coupled cells are substantially more common than was previously believed."
https://openalex.org/W2137759749,"We have defined the structure of adenovirus 2 (Ad2) cytoplasmic RNAs produced during the early phase of infection. Hybrids between cytoplasmic RNA and DNA restriction fragments of the viral genome were digested with endonuclease S1 or exonuclease VII, and the products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Seven abundant cytoplasmic RNAs (assumed to be mRNAs) were identified, and all have a spliced structure. Different mRNAs produced from a single transcriptional unit contain extensively overlapping sequences, and differ from each other by the pattern in which genome sequences are spliced together. The structures of the early Ad2 mRNAs are consistent with a model for mRNA biosynthesis in which an initial transcript is processed into a mature mRNA by ""splicing out"" internal sequences. The pattern of spliced mRNAs produced from the early region responsible for the transforming activity of Ad2 resembles the splicing pattern of the oncogenic early mRNAs of simian virus 40 (SV40). This fact, in conjunction with recent DNA sequencing results, leads us to suggest that, like the SV40 tumor antigens, the polypeptides encoded by these Ad2 mRNAs have an identical amino acid sequence at their N terminal ends, but have different C terminal sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1519085965,"The affinity (Ka) of human coagulation Factor Xa for thrombin-treated (to stimulate the release reaction) platelets has been determined to be 3 to 4 x 10(10) M-1 by equilibrium binding studies using 125I-labeled Xa. The binding of Factor Xa to platelets results in an increase of 300,000-fold in the apparent enzymatic activity of Xa in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. The activity of platelet surface Xa is approximately 15-fold greater than that observed with optimum concentrations of bovine Factor V and phospholipids in place of platelets. Ca2+ is required for the Xa-platelet interaction; the optimum concentration is 2.5 mM. Related coagulation factors, including Factor X, Factor IXa, diisopropylphosphoryl Factor Xa, and prothrombin do not complete with Factor Xa for the Xa binding sites. The rate of thrombim formation at saturating amounts of Xa is directly proportional to the number of platelets from 1 x 10(7) to 5 x 10(8) platelets/ml. Factor Xa bound to platelets is not inactivated by antithrombin III. An antibody that inhibits both human and bovine coagulation Factor V activity blocks both Xa binding to released platelets and the rapid thrombin formation associated with this binding, suggesting that Factor V from platelets is involved in the Xa-platelet interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1994441429,"Abstract Strictly anchorage-dependent 3T6 fibroblasts require contact with a solid surface for growth and for normal macromolecular metabolism. Denial of surface contact or anchorage by suspension in methocel leads to dramatic changes in messenger RNA metabolism and protein synthesis. These are reversed when cells contact a surface, even when spreading is prevented by agents such as concanavalin A. The responses to suspension appear to be well ordered regulatory events. While the synthesis of hnRNA remains constant, the production of mRNA is reduced 5 fold within a few hours under suspension conditions, suggesting a possible post-transcriptional control mechanism. Normally turning over messenger RNA is stabilized; the breakdown rate is reduced to match the lowered rate of message production so that the total amount of mRNA in the suspended fibroblasts remains constant. Protein synthesis declines slowly but extensively, and amounts to only 15% of control cells after 72 hr of suspension. The rate of protein synthesis is clearly not regulated by the amount of mRNA present, but rather by its availability. This is shown by the 6–7 fold increase of protein synthesis which occurs within 4 hr after the reattachment of suspended cells to a solid substrate. Messenger RNA production remains low during this period and cannot account for the resumption of protein synthesis. Rather, the recovery utilizes preexisting mRNA that has been translationally inactive, and this mRNA, once returned to translation, is engaged on full-sized polyribosomes, indicating the absence of a lesion in polypeptide initiation. At least one major protein, of about 43,000 dalton molecular weight, shows greatly enhanced synthesis during recovery. This polypeptide comigrates with actin in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and is extensively associated with the cytoskeleton. Its enhanced synthesis following cell reattachment may represent a modulation of a morphology-related gene."

https://openalex.org/W2058905123,"A quantitative estimate of the cellular tubulin concentration can be obtained by the use of a radioimmunoassay based upon the competition between tubulin in cell extracts and a known amount of radioactively labeled homogeneous tubulin during binding to a limited amount of anti-tubulin antibodies. This assay shows that a variety of widely used tissue culture cells (mouse L cells, mouse 3T3 cells, chick embryo fibroblasts) have a tubulin content which corresponds to approximately 2.5--3.3% of their total protein. Transformation of mouse 3T3 cells by the DNA virus SV40, and of chick embryo cells by the RNA Rous sarcoma virus, does not change the intracellular tubulin concentration. Transformed cells of brain origin, such as some glia tumor cell lines and some neuroblastoma cell lines, have a much lower tubulin content than does normal brain tissue. The intracellular concentration of tubulin in mouse 3T3 cells is discussed in relation to the number of microtubules detected during interphase by immunofluorescence microscopy. These results are also discussed in view of a mechanism of microtubule elongation in vivo driven by self-assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1482118367,"The C5a molecule is one of two spasmogenic fragments (i.e. C3a and C5a) released from serum components C3 and C5 during complement activation. These fragments are called anaphylatoxins because their ability to stimulate mast cell histamine release, smooth muscle contraction, and increased vascular permeability may lead to a fatal reaction resembling anaphylactic shock in experimental animals. In addition, the C5a molecule, which is a glycoprotein, is perhaps the most potent of all humoral chemoattractants for polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Most of the structural analyses in this study were performed on the desArg 74 form of human C5a (C5adesArg). C5adesArg represents a natural form of C5a that is recovered from activated serum when no inhibitors are added to block the action of serum carboxypeptidase. The complete primary structure of the human C5a polypeptide portion is reported here. A partial characterization of intact human C5a has been previously reported (Fernandez, H. N., and Hugli, T. E. (1976) J. Immunol. 117, 1688–1694). The polypeptide portion of C5a contains 74 amino acids, accounting for a molecular weight of 8,200 while the carbohydrate portion accounts for approximately 3,000. The carbohydrate portion of C5a exists as a single complex oligosaccharide unit attached to an asparagine at position 64. An unusual feature of the C5a molecule is its large content of half-cystine, which accounts for more than 9% of its total residues. Two repeating Cys sequences occur in the linear structure and 6 of the 7 half-cystines in C5a are located at nearly identical positions to those in the human C3a molecule. In fact, sequence similarities between C3a and C5a indicate their common genetic ancestry. The role of C5a and C5adesArg as chemotactic factors prompted comparisons of their structural features with those of the chemotactically active formyl-Met peptides (Schiffman E., Corcoran, B. A., and Wahl, S. M. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 72, 1059–1062). Removal of the COOH-terminal arginyl residue from C5a reduces chemotactic activity; therefore, the terminal portion of this molecule appears to play an active role in stimulating leukocyte migration. Hence the COOH-terminal sequence of C5a was examined for structural similarities to that of the formyl-Met peptides. Since methionine assumes a special functional importance in the formyl-Met peptides, attention is focused on the single methionyl residue in C5a. This methionyl residue, located near the COOH terminus of the molecule, may play an active role in the functional expression of C5a as a chemotactic factor. Although human and pig C3a show a close structural and functional relationship to C5a they lack the ability to excite leukotaxis, and this difference may correlate with the absence of a methionyl residue near the COOH terminus of C3a."
https://openalex.org/W2069148911,"A cloned histone gene cluster of the highly reiterated type from the sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris was analyzed by DNA sequencing. More than half of the 6 kb repeat was sequenced, including coding regions of all five histones, some prelude and trailing sequences lying adjacent to the structural genes, and segments of the AT-rich spacer DNA. The gene cluster does not code for gonad-specific histone variants but may instead be active in early sea urchin development, as indicated by comparison to reference histones. The encoded histones seem not to be derived from longer precursor proteins, nor is there any evidence for insert sequences within the coding regions. Sequence similarities exist among the putative ribosome-binding sites adjacent to the initiator codons of individual genes. The AT-rich spacer segments between the genes differ from each other, are made up from relatively simple nucleotide arrangements, but are not repetitious, and apparently do not code for additional large proteins."

(Sobel, A., Weber, M., and Changeux, J.-P. (1977) Eur. J. Biochem. 80, 215-224). The receptor was extracted with 2% potassium cholate in the presence of 2.5% soybean phospholipids. After reconstitution by the cholate dialysis procedure, the vesicles exhibited a rapid, carbamylcholine-dependent uptake of 22Na+, which was inhibited by alpha-bungarotoxin and several other known inhibitors. At concentrations above 5 x 10(-5) M carbamylcholine, the fast phase of Na+ influx lasted less than 10 sec. At 5 x 10(-6)M, it lasted 30 sec but was only about 50% of the maximal total uptake observed at optimal agonist concentration. The phenomenon of desensitization was exhibited by the reconstituted vesicles. When 2 x 10(-4)M carbamylcholine was added, 15 sec before 22Na+, the rapid Na+ influx phase was no longer observed."

https://openalex.org/W2029053787,"The representation of message sequences in nuclear RNA was studied in sea urchin tissues which utilize these messages in their polysomes and in tissues which do not. A 3H-labeled single-copy DNA tracer highly enriched for sequences complementary to blastula embryo mRNA was prepared. This tracer (mDNA) reacted to 78% with excess blastula mRNA, compared with 2.1% for the starting single-copy DNA. As expected from previous data, the mDNA reacted to only 12% with cytoplasmic RNA of adult intestine, since most embryo mRNA sequences are not detectable in this tissue. The mDNA reacted to the same extent, however, with nuclear RNA from either adult intestine, adult coelomocytes or gastrula embryos as with polysomal mRNA from blastula embryos. Thus virtually all of the blastula mRNA sequences are present in adult tissue nuclear RNAs, although most of these mRNA sequences are absent from cytoplasmic or polysomal RNA in the adult cells. The blastula mRNA sequences are present in heterogeneous nuclear RNAs at the same concentrations as are nuclear transcripts of most single-copy DNA sequences. Calculations based on the steady state concentration of structural gene transcripts in the embryo nuclei suggest that a majority of these molecules do not serve as message precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1998347759,"3.18 kb fragments of X. laevis DNA coding for tRNA1met have been inserted into a λ vector via Hind III termini and cloned in E. coli. The organization of one cloned fragment has been analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and RNA-DNA hybridization. From the distribution of sites for three enzymes, this fragment appears to be typical of the majority of λ. laevis tandem tDNA1met repeat units. Evidence is presented to suggest that it contains two genes coding for tRNA1met and at least one gene coding for a second as yet unidentified 4S RNA species. The two tRNA1met genes are located on the same DNA strand 0.96 and 1.38 kb from one end of the repeat unit. A detailed restriction map for 19 enzymes reveals that the spacers between these genes are not identical, and it provides no indication of short repetitive sequence elements within the spacers."

https://openalex.org/W2057004885,"Thrombin covalently linked to carboxylate-modified polystyrene beads initiated division of quiescent chick embryo (CE) cells either in medium containing low levels of serum or in serum-free medium. Release of thrombin was monitored by measuring acid-precipitable radioactivity released from 125I-thrombin beads into the medium during incubation with cells. Even if all of the acid-precipitable material released from the beads were active thrombin, it was not sufficient to account for any of the observed cell division, and was 10-30 fold less than the amount necessary to produce the increase in cell number caused by the thrombin beads. Two other kinds of experiments also showed that material released into the medium did not account for the observed initiation of cell division. First, medium taken from cultures incubated with thrombin beads did not initiate cell division when added to new quiescent cultures. Second, in coverslip experiments where populations of cells with an without thrombin feads shared the same medium, only bead-contacted cells divided. Several results suggested that the material which was released from the thrombin beads resulted from cell-associated proteolysis rather than from ""leakage"" of intact thrombin from the beads. For example, after incubating 125I-thrombin beads with or without CE cells, we were unable to detect any intact thrombin released into the medium. In addition, most of the material released from the beads was acid-soluble and was only released in the presence of CE cells. A few thrombin beads were endocytosed by CE cells, but they were surrounded by an intact plasma membrane. Thus they did not directly interact with the cytoplasm. The close association of many of the beads with the cell surface and the presence of a few beads in endocytic vesicles made it important to consider the possibility that thrombin might be released from the beads directly into the cells. This possibility was explored using ultrastructural (EM) autoradiography. With this technique (where one grain represented 700--900 thrombin molecules), we found that beads inside the cells had approximately the same number of grains as beads not in contact with cells. This suggested that little, if any, additional radioactive material had been released from the beads which were in contact with the cells. In addition, we were unable to detect any grains in the cytoplasm which could be attributed to released thrombin, even using an amount of 125I-thrombin beads which was 8 fold greater than the amount which produced maximal cell division. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence that thrombin action at the cell surface is sufficient to initiate division of CE cells."
https://openalex.org/W2029340227,"We have determined the relative location of pancreatic DNAase (DNAase I), spleen acid DNAase (DNAase II) and staphylococcal nuclease cleavage sites in the nucleosome core. Each of these three enzymes cleaves the DNA of chromatin at 10.n nucleotide intervals (n integer); this specificity presumably reflects the internal structure of the nucleosome. We have already reported that DNAase I cleaves nucleosomal DNA so that nearest adjacent cuts on opposite strands are staggered by 2 nucleotides, 3' end extending (Sollner-Webb and Felsenfeld, 1977). Here we show that the nearest cuts made by DNAase II in nucleosomal DNA are staggered by 4 nucleotides, 3' end extending, while cuts made by staphylococcal nuclease have a stagger of 2 nucleotides, 5' end extending. The cutting sites of the three enzymes thus do not coincide. Each pair of staggered cuts, however, is symmetrically located about a common axis-that is, the ""dyad axes"" that bisect nearest pairs of cutting sites coincide for all three enzymes. This result is consistent with the presence of a true dyad axis in the nucleosome core. Our results support the conclusion that a structural feature of the nucleosome, having a 10 nucleotide periodicity, is the common recognition site for all three nucleases. The position of the cut is determined, however, by the individual characteristics of each enzyme. Sites potentially available to nuclease cleavage span a region of 4 nucleotides out of this 10 nucleotide repeat, and a large fraction of these sites are actually cut. Thus much of the nucleosomal DNA must in some sense be accessible to the environment."

Detailed spectroscopic characterization of the resolved components has resulted in the identification of four different chlorins and six different esterifying alcohols. The major esterifying alcohol is trans, trans-farnesol, but smaller amounts of geranylgeraniol, tetrahydrogeranylgeraniol, phytol, cis-9-hexadecen-1-ol and 4-undecyl-2-furanmethanol are also observed. The high information content intrinsic in the compositional analyses of the complex pigment mixtures found in green sulfur bacteria appears to provide a new probe of the mechanisms of pigment biosynthesis in these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2067413174,"We have investigated the locations of the poly(A), the mRNA-specific sequences and the RNA sequences that are eventually cleaved from the 1860 nucleotide precursor of mouse beta-globin mRNA. Biochemical and electron microscopic data demonstrate that there are two intervening RNA moieties in the precursor which separate the beta-globin mRNA sequences into three portions containing 480, 205 and 155 nucleotides. One of the two intervening RNA moieties contains 780 nucleotides. The size of the smaller intervening RNA has not been determined precisely, but it is 125 nucleotides or less. The largest mRNA-specific fragment is derived from the 3' terminus of the precursor, and contains the 3' terminal poly (A) and 330 mRNA-specific transcribed nucleotides. At least one, and probably both, intervening RNAs occur within the coding portion of the mRNA sequences. The larger of the intervening RNAs is located next to the 480 nucleotide mRNA-specific fragment, and the smaller intervening RNA is located between the 205 and 155 nucleotide mRNA-specific fragments. These experiments are consistent with the notion that the intervening sequences in the DNA of mouse beta-globin genes are transcribed into the mRNA precursor and are excised from the RNA by post-transcriptional events."

Ovalbumin gene is split in chicken DNA. Nature. 1977; 270: 314-319 Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar ) are shown to be due to the presence of intervening sequences which separate the messenger-coding sequences. We present evidence for an additional interruption of the gene, which, together with those reported earlier and by Garapin et al. (1978b), make a total of six intervening sequences. All of these intervening sequences are located in the DNA region that corresponds to the part of the ov mRNA which codes for amino acids. The seven coding fragments of the split ovalbumin gene are arranged in the same order and relative orientation as in the ovalbumin double-stranded cDNA. All the sequences coding for ov mRNA are contained in a chromosomal DNA region of 6000 bp, which is more than 3 times longer than ov mRNA. The general organization of the ovalbumin split gene is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1596158098,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase activities in extracts of livers from rats pretreated with glucagon are higher than in controls. This time-dependent activation is seen when the hydroxylase is assayed in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin, but not in the presence of 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin. A maximum 4-fold stimulation of hydroxylase activity was correlated with a conversion of the multiple forms of the enzyme to a single form. This form is characterized by an increased extent of phosphorylation compared to the unactivated enzyme. Incorporation of radioactive inorganic phosphate into phenylalanine hydroxylase following administration of glucagon was determined after specific immunoprecipitation of the enzyme from partially purified preparations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis showed that stimulation of enzyme activity is accompanied by incorporation of 32Pi into the protein to the extent of 0.7 mol/mol of hydroxylase subunit. These results demonstrate the phosphorylation of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase in vivo and strongly support the idea that the activity of this enzyme can be hormonally regulated through a phosphorylation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1533970251,"On exposure to suitable activating agents, neutrophils sharply alter their oxygen metabolism, showing large increases in oxygen uptake, O2 and H2O2 production, and glucose consumption via the hexose monophosphate shunt. These metabolic alterations, which together are designated the burst, are due to the activation of a system which catalyzes the reaction: 2O2 + NADPH leads to 2O2(-) + NADP. This O2(-)-forming system is found in a particulate fraction isolated from neutrophils which had been activated with opsonized zymosan. When these particles were treated with detergent under suitable conditions, the O2(-)-forming activity was released in a form which passed through a membrane filter capable of retaining species of Mr greater than 3000,000. Soluble O2(-)-forming activity was obtained from normal activated neutrophils, but not from normal resting neutrophils or from activated neutrophils obtained from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, an inherited condition in which the respiratory burst is defective. O2(-)production by the soluble system required a reduced pyridine nucleotide as electron donor, and showed a quadratic dependence on the concentration of the solubilized preparation."

The frequencies and the rates of segregation of the Emtr and Thgr (thioguanine-resistant, an X-linked recessive mutation) markers were determined from hybrids constructed between an Emtr-Thgr CHO cell line and various other Chinese hamster lines (V79, M3-1, CHO, GM7S, CHW and CHL). Thgr segregants were obtained at similar frequencies (10(-2)-10(-3)) from all the hybrids. The frequency of segregation of the Emtr marker, however, was similar to that of Thgr only in the CHO x CHO hybrids and was much lower (10(-4)-10(-6)) than the CHO x other Chinese hamster hybrids. Similar results were obtained when the segregation rates for the two markers from various hybrids were determined. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that in CHO cells, the gene responsible for Emtr is present in a single (functional) copy, whereas two copies of this gene are present in other Chinese hamster lines examined."
https://openalex.org/W1520159237,"A detailed binding study of 125I-labeled diphtheria toxin to isolated cell surface membrane-enriched fractions is reported. The study was undertaken to determine if toxin-resistant species exhibit a defet in either the binding step or the transport step of the intoxication process. Surface membrane fractions were obtained from liver and mammary glands of toxin-sensitive species, rabbit and giunea pig, and toxin-resistant species, rat mouse. All membrane fractions exhibited reversible binding of 125I-toxin which was competitively inhibited by unlabeled toxin. Toxin receptors from liver co-purified with plasma membranes and the plasma membrane marker 5'-nucleotidase. One-half saturation of all receptors occurred between 5 x 10(-8) and 1.8 x 10(-7) M. Scatchard plots were nonlinear and concave upwards. Total receptor sites ranged from 3.4 to 16 pmol/mg of membrane protein, tissue differences being more pronounced than difference between sensitive and nonsensitive species. Over 95% of the toxin specific binding was inhibited by removal of divalent cation from the medium or by the inclusion of 1 mM ATP, procedures which have been shown to protect sensitive cells from intoxication by diphtheria toxin. We conclude that the rat and mouse have surface membrane receptors for diphtheria toxin and that the toxin insensitivity of these species results from a defect in or a lack of the transport process."
https://openalex.org/W2009476309,"Cloned repetitive sequences from the S. purpuratus genome a few hundred to approximately 1000 nucleotides long were used to investigate the characteristics of individual repetitive sequence families. They were terminally labeled by the kinase procedure and reacted with sheared S. purpuratus DNA. Repetition frequencies were measured for 26 individual families and were found to vary from a few to several thousand copies per genome. Estimates of sequence divergence were made for 18 cloned repeat families by measuring thermal stability of the heteroduplexes formed between the genomic DNA and the cloned fragments, compared with that of the renatured cloned fragments. The difference was <4°C for three of the 18 families, and <10°C for 13 of the 18 families. These 13 repetitive sequence families lack any detectable highly divergent sequence relatives, and the results reported are shown not to change when the renaturation criterion is lowered below 55°C in 0.18 M Na+. Five of the 18 cloned families displayed greater sequence divergence. The average sequence divergence of the total short repetitive sequence fraction of S. purpuratus DNA was found to match closely the average of the divergences of the cloned repeat sequences."

Electron microscopy and restriction enzyme analysis have revealed that the sequences coding for the 5′ quarter (∼500 nucleotides) of ov mRNA are split into four regions separated by three intervening sequences. The cloning procedure seems to be reliable, since the restriction enzyme pattern of the cloned Eco RI fragment “b” is similar to that of the corresponding chromosomal DNA fragment.

https://openalex.org/W1597227750,"Sea urchin embryos contain a large cytoplasmic pool of microtubular protein, from which they can regenerate cilia several times without the need for synthesizing additional tubulin. The present studies were initiated to determine if a requirement for new tubulin synthesis can be induced by depleting this pool through repeated cycles of deciliation. By the third round of deciliation, there is a 2- to S-fold increase in the rate of incorporation of r%]methionine into a- and &tubulin. To determine if this enhanced synthesis of tubulin is due to an increase in cytoplasmic levels of translatable tubulin mRNA, poly(A)-containing RNA was isolated from control and 5 x -deeiliated embryos by phenol/chloroform extraction and oligo(dT)-affinity chromatography. Translation of these RNAs in a wheat germ proteinsynthesizing system revealed a 2- to a-fold higher rate of e- andg-tubulin formation in the presence of poly(A)containing RNA from deciliated embryos. When the deciliation experiments were carried out in the presence of 100 pg/ml of actinomycin D (sufficient to inhibit RNA synthesis by greater than 95%), the enhanced rate of tubulin formation no longer occurred, although tubulin continued to be synthesized at control rates. Actinomycin D was also found to significantly inhibit the regeneration of cilia relative to nontreated organisms, but only after embryos were subjected to two to three rounds of deciliation. Since these results suggested the possible existence of control at the level of gene transcription, double label experiments were carried out to determine if the specific activity of labeled tubulin mRNA is enhanced in deciliated embryos. Deciliated and control embryos were labeled with [“HI- and [14C]uridine, respectively, and the polysomal poly(A)-containing RNA isolated and fractionated both by sodium dodecyl sulfate-sucrose gradient centrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In both cases, a peak in the ‘H/14C ratio was observed with a sedimentation coefficient slightly larger than 18 S. When these RNA fractions were translated in the wheat germ cell-free system, this peak in ‘H/14C ratio was found in both cases to correspond to the peak in tub.ulin mRNA activity, suggesting that the specific activity of tubulin mRNA is elevated in deciliated embryos. These results, considered along with the actinomycin data, are consistent with the hypothesis that the increase in the level of translatable tubulin mRNA which occurs as"

At pH 7.4, at least 2 strong Ca2+ sites, with an average KDISS of 0.1 +/- 0.02 mM, are found. An additional 10 to 11 weaker Ca2+ binding sites, with an average KDISS of 1.3 +/- 0.2 mM are noted, at high levels of Ca2+. At pH 6.5, again at least 2 strong Ca2+ sites on factor IX are evident, with an average KDISS of 0.11 +/- 0.02 mM; but slightly fewer (7 to 8) weaker sites, with an average KDISS of 1.9 +/- 0.3 mM, are obtained. Qualitatively, the binding of Mn2+ to bovine factor IX appears similar to that of Ca2+. At pH 6.5, approximately 2 strong Mn2+ binding sites, with an average KDISS of 13 +/- 1.5 micrometer, and an additional 5 to 6 weak sites, with an average KDISS of 160 +/- 15 micrometer, are present. Manganese does not completely displace Ca2+; and Ca2+ does not completely displace Mn2+ from their respective binding sites.

The rate and extent of activation of bovine factor IX, by bovine factor XIa, is dependent on the Ca2+ concentration, up to concentrations of Ca2+ which saturate its effect on the system. Substitution of Sr2+ for Ca2+ leads to approximately 50% of the maximum rate of factor IXa formation, and final yield of factor IXa, in this activation system. Manganese does not substitute for Ca2+ in this activation, but does inhibit the stimulatory effect of Ca2+. Both Tb3+ and Sm3+ are effective inhibitors of Ca2+ in factor IX activation by factor XIa."
https://openalex.org/W2096650460,"A soluble enzyme preparation obtained from rat liver lysosomes catalyzed the conversion of phosphatidyl-[1',3'-14C]glyceryol to [14C]bis(monoacylglyceryl)phosphate. When this preparation was delipidated with n-butyl alcohol, very low activity was observed when incubated with phosphatidyl[1',3'-14C]glycerol alone. The activity could be restored by incubating with aqueous dispersions of lysosomal phospholipids; lysosomal neutral lipid and glycolipid fractions were inactive. When the pospholipid fraction was separated into individual classes, activity was found only in phosphatidylinositol. With a more extensively delipidated soluble enzyme preparation from lysosomes, bis-(monoacylglyceryl)P synthesis without added lipid was 0.05 nmol mg-1 h-1 versus 5.9 nmol-1 h-1 at the optimal phosphatidylinositol concentation. The mechanism of this marked stimulation of bis(monoacylglyceryl)P synthesis by phosphatidylinostiol was examined. Evidence is presented which demonstrates the incorporation of 3H-labeled fatty acids from [3H]phosphatidylinositol into bis(monoacylglyceryl)P. Phosphatidylinositol stimulates the reaction by serving as an acyl donor to phosphatidylglycerol or lysophosphatidylglycerol, the substrates for bis(monoacylglyceryl)Psynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1581729164,"Diluted solutions (less than 100 mg/dl) of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (Hb S) and Hb CHarlem were found to aggregate with a clear demonstration of a delay time when dissolved in concentrated phosphate buffer. The delay time could be shortened by increasing the concentration of either hemoglobin or phosphate. Upon cooling or bubbling with carbon monoxide, the aggregates melted quickly. The logarithmic plot of reciprocal delay time versus hemoglobin or phosphate concentration shows a linear line with a slope of 2.7 for hemoglobin and 44 for phosphate. This suggests that diluted solutions of Hb S aggregate by the nucleation mechanism which is similar to that reported in the gelation of concentrated Hb S solution."
https://openalex.org/W2079327693,"Cytoplasmic extracts of untreated cultures of a virus-resistant mutant of mouse 3T6 cells, designated 3T6-VrB2, contain two double-stranded, RNA-activated enzyme activities associated with interferon action. These are the synthesis of a low molecular weight oligonucleotide inhibitor of cell-free protein synthesis from ATP, and the phosphorylation of a 67,000 dalton polypeptide by transfer of the gamma phosphate of ATP. Basal levels of both enzyme activities are detectable in extracts of untreated parental 3T6 cells, and are greatly enhanced upon interferon pretreatment. A procedure was developed, using a nonionic detergent to effect cell lysis, which allowed the analysis of the protein kinase activity from as few as 2 x 10(7) cells. Using this procedure, direct proportionalities were demonstrated between the concentration of interferon to which 3T6 cells were exposed, and both the level of protein kinase activity and the magnitude of the antiviral state were established in these cells. Furthermore, untreated cultures of 3T6-VrB2 exhibited both an antiviral state and an intracellular protein kinase activity equal to that of cultures of the parental 3T6 cells pretreated with a single concentration of mouse interferon."
https://openalex.org/W1579242547,"A new guanosine analogue has been synthesized, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl guanosine, which has an electrophilic moiety capable of reacting covalently with several classes of amino acid side chains found in proteins. This compound reacts with bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase to desensitize it irreversibly to inhibition by GTP, without affecting its intrinsic catalytic activity. The specific addition of GTP or GTP and TPNH to the reaction mixture prevents the loss of sensitivity to GTP inhibition. The corporation of approximately 1 mol of 5'-p-sulfonylbenzoyl guanosine/enzyme subunit is associated with the decreased responsiveness of the enzyme to regulation by GTP. It is proposed that 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl guanosine may be reacting within the allosteric GTP site of glutamate dehydrogenase and that this compound may have general applicability in the affinity labeling of regulatory and catalytic sites of proteins which normally bind guanosine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1971779273,"A chloramphenicol-resistant, aminopterin-sensitive cell line (AMT) derived from a mouse mammary tumor MT-29240 was enucleated, and the cytoplasts were fused with nucleated chloramphenicol-sensitive, HAT-resistant SV40 3T3 mouse cells. The resulting cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids) were selected for their resistance to chloramphenicol and the chromosome complement of the SV40 3T3 cells. In addition to transfer of chloramphenicol resistance, these cybrid clones, as studied in the electron microscope, contained the intracisternal A particle phenotype characteristic of only the AMT cells. The cytoplasmic microtubule complex (CMTC) in these cybrids was also studied and appears to resemble the elaborate CMTC of the AMT cells more closely than the more reduced CMTC of the SV40 3T3. When treated with a colcemid block and then a brief reverse, the microtubule organizing centers (MTOC) appear as bright fluorescent foci when tubulin antibody and indirect immunofluorescence techniques are used. When AMT or SV40 3T3 cells are treated in this manner, only one MTOC is present in interphase cells. One clone of these cybrids, however, contained two MTOCs in interphase cells. This CMTC and MTOC phenotype has persisted in this cybrid clone for over 3 months of continuous culture."
https://openalex.org/W1515353668,"Rat renal phosphate-dependent glutaminase is rapidly inactivated by incubating with L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic scid. Concentrations of phosphate, which increase the glutaminase activity, decrease the rate of inactivation by chloroketone. In addition, inactivation is not blocked by glutamine. Instead, glutamate was shown to specifically reduce the rate of chloroketone inactivation. Upon sodium lauryl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified glutaminase preparation exhibits at least five protein staining bands which range in molecular weight from 57,000 to 75,000. Studies with 14C-labeled chloroketone indicate that this reagent reacts with each of these peptides. The mean stoichiometry of binding was calculated to be 1.3 mol/mol of enzyme. Therefore, these results indicate that the glutaminase may contain a specific site for binding glutamate and that the purified enzyme consists of a series of related peptides which may have resulted from partial proteolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1493220298,"A ribosome dissociation factor(s) has been partially purified from extracts of wheat germ. This factor can be detected by its ability to prevent the reassociation of ribosomal subunits when the magnesium concentration is raised from 1 mM to 5 mN. The majority of the dissociation factor activity is found in the postribosomal supernatant of the cell and can be precipitated between 0 and 40% ammonium sulfate. Chromatography of this material on DEAE-cellulose yields a fraction which contains both the dissociation factor activity and initiation factor eLF-3. However, the majority of the dissociation factor activity can be readily separated from eIF-3 by chromatography on phosphocellulose. The dissociation factor appears to be distinct from any of the othe known wheat germ initiation factors."
https://openalex.org/W1581321921,"The uptake of 28Mg and 45Ca was measured in S49 lymphoma cells. The beta-adrenergic agonist (-)-isoproterenol markedly inhibited the rate of 28Mg accumulation but had no effect on 45Ca accumulation. The effect of (-)-isoproterenol was blocked by (-)-propranolol. In variants of the S49 cell line deficient in adenylate cyclase activity (cyc-) or in hormone receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling (unc), (-)-isoproterenol had no effect on 28Mg accumulation. The S49 lymphoma cells also possess prostaglandin E1 receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase, and, like (-)-isoproterenol, prostaglandin E1 decreased the rate of 28Mg uptake. Experiments with the mouse erythroleukemia cell line GM86 also showed a beta-adrenergic-mediated decrease in the rate of accumulation of 28Mg. Previous work has shown that Mg2+ increases the affinity of agonists for the beta-adrenergic receptor (Bird, S.J., and Maguire, M.E. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, in press). In view of these effects of Mg2+, it is suggested that Mg2+, but not Ca2+, may regulate the sensitivity of S49 cell adenylate cyclase to stimulation by catecholamines."
https://openalex.org/W2033008467,"Abstract The switch from HbA (α 2 β 2 A ) to HbC (α 2 β 2 C ) synthesis was induced by injection of erythropoietin into a lamb homozygous for HbA. Serial samples of bone marrow were analyzed to detect the initial commitment of erythroid stem cells (CFU-E) to form colonies which made HbC in vitro, and to detect the initial accumulation of β C -globin mRNA and the onset of HbC synthesis in erythroblasts in vivo. CFU-E-derived erythroid colonies were formed in plasma clot culture at a low erythropoietin concentration, and the relative amounts of β A - and β C -globin synthesized were determined after a 24 hr pulse of 3 H-leucine, added after 84 hr in culture. RNA was extracted from nuclei and cytoplasm of early and populations of bone marrow erythroblasts which had been fractionated by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation. The concentration of β A - and β C -globin mRNA was determined by annealing to purified synthetic DNAs (cDNAs) complementary to β A and β C mRNA. No β C -globin was synthesized in erythroblasts or in CFU-E-derived erythroid colonies prior to the injection of erythropoietin. An increase in the concentration of CFU-E in the bone marrow and the appearance of β C -globin synthesis in CFU-E-derived colonies were detected 12 hr after the erythropoietin injection. In contrast, β C mRNA was not detected in either early or erythroid cells until 36 hr later. The first measurable β C -globin mRNA was accompanied by the appearance of β C -globin synthesis in bone marrow erythroblasts. Our results suggest that the accumulation of β C -globin mRNA is a relatively late event following induction of HbA to HbC switching by erythropoietin. The expansion of the compartment of erythroid stem cells and the commitment of CFU-E to β C -globin synthesis appear to precede the detectable accumulation of β C mRNA by 24–36 hr."
https://openalex.org/W1531203447,"A procedure for the purification of the asparagine, lysine, serine, and valine:tRNA ligases from the same batch of Bacillus stearothemophilus is described. The purified enzymes were apparently homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When the molecu- lar weights of the asparagine, lysine, and serine:tRNA ligases, determined under nondenaturing conditions by equilibrium centrifugation and velocity sedimentation, were compared with the molecular weights obtained under denaturing conditions, these enzymes appeared to contain two subunits of equal molecular weight per molecule of active enzyme. The catalytic properties at high temperatures of these enzymes and of the valine:tRNA ligase from the same organism have also been investigated. When as- sayed in the temperature range SO-70°C under condi- tions when there was no measurable loss of catalytic activity, all enzymes showed a marked deviation from linearity in the Arrhenius plots indicating a reversible inhibition both of the aminoacylation and the ATR- pyrophosphate exchange reactions. This inhibition could not be related to the melting of the tRNA sub- strates as measured by hyperchromicity. On the other hand, the K,,,values for ATP and amino acid increased sharply in this temperature range in contrast to the K,,, values for tRNA which showed only the expected grad- ual increase with temperature. The inhibition observed could be explained by assuming a temperature-induced conformational change of the enzymes affecting pri- marily the binding sites for ATP and amino acid. The amino acid:tRNA ligases play a central role in the translation of geneic information into amino acid sequences in proteins. The mechanism by which they select their tRNA substrates is also an interesting example of a specific interac- tion between an enzyme and a nucleic acid and has conse- quently received much attention. In the final analysis our understanding of this process must be based on a detailed knowledge of the structure of both enzyme and tRNA. Several ligases’ have been crystallixed by now (l-5), and for one of them, the tyrosine enzyme from Bacillus stearothermophilus, a low resolution structure has been obtained (4), and a struc- ture at high resolution can be expected in the near future.

One of the active fractions was purified from the extract through the steps of solvent fractionation, chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, and gel filtration. Biochemical and microbiological analyses showed that the purified complex consists of a Mr = 70,000 protein and tetrahydropteroyldiglutamate. In contrast to the extreme lability of free tetrahydropteridines the complex was quite stable against autooxidation under aerobic conditions."
