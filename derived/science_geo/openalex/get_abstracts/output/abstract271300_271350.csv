https://openalex.org/W2052800549,"Fundamental conceptual problems that arise from the macroscopic and microscopic aspects of the second law of thermodynamics are considered. It is shown that nonequilibrium may become a source of order and that irreversible processes may lead to a new type of dynamic states of matter called ""dissipative structures."" The thermodynamic theory of such structures is outlined. A microscopic definition of irreversible processes is given, and a transformation theory is developed that allows one to introduce nonunitary equations of motion that explicitly display irreversibility and approach to thermodynamic equilibrium. The work of the group at the University of Brussels in these fields is briefly reviewed. In this new development of theoretical chemistry and physics, it is likely that thermodynamic concepts will play an ever-increasing role."
https://openalex.org/W2081181587,"It is ascertained that, within the range of stability, the transition temperature of the superconducting solutions between Ti and Zr and between Zr and Hf, and the Curie point of the corresponding ferromagnetic solutions between TiZn(2) and ZrZn(2) and between ZrZn(2) and HfZn(2), follow a parallel behavior. From this correlation it is concluded that the weak itinerant ferromagnetism of ZrZn(2) must be due to electron-phonon interaction. Theoretical arguments are advanced to show that the underlying mechanism is hindered p-state pairing, due to a strongly localized repulsive part of the pair-potential that acts as a Hubbard interaction and gives rise to a Stoner instability."

Its likely source is water molecules sputtered by particles in the radiation belts, it may be stable, and its presence could be deduced from the rate of temperature drop in a shadow. Observation of this effect is, however, difficult, especially for the rings. A possible relation to the brightness anisotropy of ring A is pointed out."
https://openalex.org/W2013102300,"Between November 1976 and November 1977 a swarm of small earthquakes (local magnitude </= 3) occurred on or near the San Andreas fault near Palmdale, California. This swarm was the first observed along this section of the San Andreas since cataloging of instrumental data began in 1932. The activity followed partial subsidence of the 35-centimeter vertical crustal uplift known as the Palmdale bulge along this ""locked"" section of the San Andreas, which last broke in the great (surface-wave magnitude = 8(1/4)+) 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. The swarm events exhibit characteristics previously observed for some foreshock sequences, such as tight clustering of hypocenters and time-dependent rotations of stress axes inferred from focal mechanisms. However, because of our present lack of understanding of the processes that precede earthquake faulting, the implications of the swarm for future large earthquakes on the San Andreas fault are unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1971641103,"In 1975, archeological surface surveys of trade routes located again a pre-Hispanic obsidian source in central Mexico first reported in 1902. Initial trace element studies of the Paredón source through an analysis by neutron activation have been compared with similar studies of the obsidian found at Chalcatzingo 150 kilometers from the source. These comparisons indicate that obsidian from Paredón, rather than Otumba, was of primary importance during the Early Formative in central Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W2095376171,"Recent close flybys of Deimos by Viking revealed a smooth-appearing surface void of grooves. Higher-resolution pictures showed that the surface was actually covered with craters but that a regolith filled the smaller craters, giving the smooth appearance. The surface was also covered with boulders and bright streak-like markings analogous to base-surge or ejecta cloud deposits."
