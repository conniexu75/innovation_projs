https://openalex.org/W1628719417,"We have isolated a large noncollagenous glycoprotein, laminin, from a mouse tumor that produces basement membrane. The protein consists of at least two polypeptide chains (Mr = 220,000 and Mr = 440,000) joined to each other by disulfide bonds. Laminin and type IV collagen are major constituents of the tumor. Laminin is distinctly different from fibronectin, another component of basement membranes, in amino acid composition and immunological reactivity. Pepsin digestion of laminin releases a large, cystine-rich fragment which retains most of the antigenicity of the original protein. Immunological studies using purified antibody against laminin show that it is produced by a variety of cultured cells. In addition, these antibodies react with the basement membranes of normal tissues, suggesting that this protein or an immunologically related protein is a constituent of the basement membranes of these tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1994357188,Depletion of dopamine in a circumscribed area of association cortex in rhesus monkeys produces an impairment in spatial delayed alternation performance nearly as severe as that caused by surgical ablation of the same area. This behavioral deficit can be pharmacologically reversed with dopamine agonists such as L-dopa and apomorphine. These data provide direct evidence that dopamine plays an important role in a specific cortical function.

In the colony-reared monkeys, spiny branchlets of Purkinje cells were more extensive in the paraflocculus and the nodulus than they were in the other two groups. Granule cell dendritic branching in the paraflocculus and nodulus did not differ across groups. In addition, Purkinje cell somas were larger in the uvula and the nodulus of the colony animals than in the other groups. These data indicate that the social and physical environment during development influences the morphology of cerebellar Purkinje cells."

https://openalex.org/W1994809230,"Five host-range mutants (Ad2hr400–hr403, Ad5hr404) of human adenovirus serotype 2 and 5 (Ad2 and Ad5) which overcome the block to growth of wild-type adenovirus in monkey cells have been isolated. They form plaques and multiply efficiently in both monkey and human cells. The alteration in each of these mutants allows the full expression of all viral late genes, in marked contrast to the depressed synthesis of many late proteins in monkey cells infected with the parental Ad2 or Ad5. The altered gene encodes a diffusible product, since the mutation acts in trans to enhance the synthesis of wild-type Ad3 late proteins during co-infections of monkey cells with Ad2hr400 and Ad3. Restriction enzyme analysis of the genomes of all the host-range mutants show that none of them contain major alterations. In addition, an earlier report ( Klessig and Hassell, 1978 Klessig D.F. Hassell J.A. Characterization of a variant of human adenovirus type 2 which multiplies efficiently in simian cells. J. Virol. 1978; 28: 945-956 PubMed Google Scholar ) indicated that Ad2hr400 does not contain SV40 sequences, which in some adenovirus-SV40 hybrid viruses allows efficient multiplication in monkey cells. The mutation responsible for the extended host range has been physically mapped by marker rescue experiments using isolated restriction enzyme fragments of the mutants to transfer the new phenotype to wild-type adenovirus. The alteration in each of the five mutants is located in a region (coordinates 62–70.7; coordinates 62–68 for Ad5hr404) which encodes predominantly the 72K DNA binding protein. More detailed mapping using Ad2hr400 fragments places the mutation (coordinates 62.9–65.6) entirely within the 72K gene. The multifunctional nature of the 72K protein and some of its similarities to SV40 T antigen are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W38611617,"Bovine platelet and plasma Factor V were compared using antisera raised to purified single chain plasma Factor V and the quantity of Factor V associated with the bovine platelet was established using a radioimmunoassay developed with the same antisera. Bovine platelet Factor V is immunochemically indistinguishable from bovine plasma Factor V using both radioimmunoassay and immunodiffusion as comparative techniques. Radioimmunoassay quantitation of platelet Factor V indicated that 593 + 139 Factor V molecules were present/platelet. Bioassay assessment of the quantity of Factor V present in the bovine platelet gave a value similar to this (666 f 124), further suggesting that the platelet and plasma derived Factor V are identical. The binding of both iz51-Factor V and -Factor Va to platelets was also measured. When incubated with washed bovine platelets, 1251-Factor Va underwent saturable and exchangeable binding. There are high affinity binding sites to which approximately 900 Factor Va molecules are bound/platelet with an apparent dissociation constant of 3 x lo-” M, as well as binding sites of slightly lower affinity (Z& = 3 X lo-’ M) to which as many as 3500 Factor Va molecules are bound/platelet. The binding of Factor V to platelets is also saturable and exchangeable. Approximately 800 Factor V molecules bind to a single class of sites with a dissociation constant of 3 x lo-’ M. Exchange studies indicated that Factor V and Factor Va both bind to the lower affinity sites; however, Factor V does not bind to the high affinity Factor Va binding sites. Thrombin-induced platelet activation was not required for, nor had any effect on, the binding of either Factor V or Factor Va. The number of Factor V molecules associated with the platelet is similar to the number of Factor V molecules bound to the low affinity platelet binding sites, and that value is also similar to the number of high affinity Factor Va binding sites."

The cells used as the source of phosphorylated enzyme were harvested 1 h after the addition of 5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid and 25 mM sodium acetate to cultures grown to early stationary phase on a low phosphate medium with limiting glucose. Double immunodiffusion and autoradiography demonstrated immunological identity between the 32P-labeled NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase and the enzyme isolated from glucose-grown E. coli. The phosphoenzyme had an apparent subunit molecular weight of 51,000 as determined by denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the radioactivity co-electrophoresed with NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase activity when purified enzyme was subjected to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. [32P]Phosphoserine was identified following partial acid hydrolysis of the purified phosphoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1486767369,"We have devised a new procedure for the purification of highly active preparations of Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase holoenzyme. A column of heparin-agarose A-15m is used to rapidly and quantitatively adsorb RNA polymerase from the initial crude extract fraction. This affinity procedure obviates the necessity of including nucleic acid precipitation or partitioning steps and allows for rapid separation of RNA polymerase from proteolytic activity. The enzyme is further purified by preparative glycerol gradient centrifugation resulting in an overall purification in 200-fold in 24 h with near quantitative recovery of polymerase protein and activity. RNA polymerase holoenzyme is obtained by chromatography on single-stranded DNA-agarose. The in vitro transcription products made by purified preparations of B. subtilis and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzymes in response to B. subtilis phage phi 29 DNA have been analyzed, and an in vitro transcription map is presented. The E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme initiates transcription from three promoter sites not efficiently utilized by the B. subtilis holoenzyme under optimal conditions for RNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2147363907,"The I region of the major histocompatibility complex contains immune response genes that display considerable polymorphism; that is, there are many alleles at each locus. These genes regulate the immune response to antigen by mediating intercellular communication among lymphoreticular cells. An analysis of the primary structure of the products of two subregions of I (I-A, I-E/C) was undertaken in order to understand the genetic organization of the region, the evolution of the genes and, eventually, their function."
https://openalex.org/W2055603575,"We have analyzed transcription units from D. melanogaster embryos in which most cells were in either the late S or the G2 phase of a synchronous cell cycle. Much of the chromatin of these embryos was observed in the form of parallel strands which appear to be newly replicated sister chromatids ( McKnight and Miller, 1977 McKnight S.L. Miller Jr., O.L. Electron microscopic analysis of chromatin replication in the cellular blastoderm Drosophila melanogaster embryo. Cell. 1977; 12: 795-804 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar ). Lateral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fibers were commonly observed attached to chromatin strands and are believed to be nascent transcripts. Very similar lateral fiber arrays were found on sister chromatid strands. Such paired, post-replicative RNP fiber arrays offer a unique opportunity to compare the transcription patterns on two copies of the same transcription unit. Analyses of paired transcription units yield the following conclusions. Transcription initiation and termination sites are the same for both copies of each transcription unit. Each transcription unit has a characteristic and constant RNP fiber frequency, and the fiber frequency is identical for both copies of the transcription unit. Active transcription units can have internal, fiber-free gaps which may result from interruptions in initiation of transcription. Transcription units differing in polarity and fiber frequency can occur in immediate juxtaposition. The relevance of these findings to eucaryotic transcriptional control mechanisms are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2089527860,"The genes coding for the 18S and 28S rRNAs in D. melanogaster were examined using Southern transfers of DNA from diploid or polytene tissue. A ribosomal gene repeat 12 kb in length is present in DNA from diploid tissue of males and is the major repeat on the Y chromosome. This repeat is present in low amounts on the X chromosome, which contains major repeats of 17 and 11.5 kb. In polytene nuclei of males, the 12 kb band is disproportionately replicated, and only a very low amount of the 11.5 kb repeat and no 17 kb repeat are detected. Polytene nuclei of females contain reduced amounts of the 17 kb repeat relative to the 11.5 kb repeat. This disproportionate replication of specific ribosomal gene repeats suggests that polytenization of the rDNA may involve an extrachromosomal mechanism. Evidence that genes from only one nucleolus organizer are replicated during polytenization in X/Y and X/X flies is discussed. A method for analyzing DNA from tissue of individual larvae was developed to test for population heterogeneity in ribosomal gene structure. Heterogeneity was observed in the ribosomal genes of three Ore R lines, four other D. melanogaster strains and between males and females of the same strain."
https://openalex.org/W1507194289,"The enzymatic components of the rabbit pulmonary monooxygenase system, cytochromes P-450I and P-450II and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, are immunochemically distinct proteins. In pulmonary microsomes, the N-demethylation of benzphetamine, amino-pyrine, and ethylmorphine, and the O-deethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin are dependent only on cytochrome P-450I, and the hydroxylation of coumarin is apparently catalyzed by both cytochromes. Cytochrome P-450II is immunochemically distinct from the major forms of hepatic cytochrome P-450 induced by phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene, whereas cytochrome P-450I is indistinguishable from the former on the basis of physical and catalytic as well as immunochemical characteristics. Pulmonary and hepatic NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductases also have identical physical, catalytic, and immunochemical properties. The lack of response of the lung monooxygenase system to phenobarbital, therefore, is apparently not due to an inability of the lung to synthesize the enzymes induced by phenobarbital in the liver. The relatively high proportion of cytochrome P-450I in the lung appears to be responsible for the higher rates (per nmol of P-450) of N-demethylation that have been observed in rabbit pulmonary as compared to hepatic microsomal fractions."
https://openalex.org/W1494605141,The DNA sequence of a cloned gene specifying Drosophila tRNA2Arg has been determined. Transcription of this gene in extracts from Xenopus germinal vesicles yielded a precursor RNA containing a seven-nucleotide leader sequence at the 5' side of the mature tRNA with pppGp as the 5'-terminal nucleotide. Transcription continues for at least eight nucleotides past the 3' terminus of the coding region of the gene and terminates over a stretch of seven T residues. The isolation of the primary transcript was facilitated by incorporation of 5'-(gamma-S)GTP into the 5' terminus of the precursor RNA and by its retention on mercury-agarose. The Drosophila tRNAArg gene does not contain an intervening sequence nor the C-C-A sequence corresponding to the 3' terminus of the mature tRNA. The nucleotide sequence of Drosophila tRNAArg formed in the in vitro system differs only in four positions from that of mouse tRNAArg.

https://openalex.org/W1543241431,"We have purified beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase from macrophages of thioglycollate-treated mice using concanavalin A chromatography and immunoprecipitation. The apparent molecular weight of the beta-galactosidase subunit, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, changed during a long term pulse-chase experiment. Following a 1-h pulse with [3H]leucine, radiolabel was present exclusively in an Mr = 82,000 form. However, after a 3-h chase in medium containing unlabeled leucine, most label migrated at Mr = 63,000, and at 24 h, all label was in the Mr = 63,000 form. Electrophoresis of peptides produced by cyanogen bromide cleavage of immunoprecipitates demonstrated structural similarities between precursor and mature forms. A mutation in the mouse, which is known to depress the rate of synthesis of beta-galactosidase in many cell types, proportionately decreased incorporation of [3H]leucine into both the Mr = 82,000 and 63,000 forms. Therefore, by kinetic, structural, and genetic evidence, the large molecular weight beta-galactosidase is a precursor of mature macrophage enzyme. No precursor of the Mr = 75,000 subunit of beta-glucuronidase was detected."
https://openalex.org/W73258851,"Escherichia coli rapidly degrade proteins with abnormal conformations by an energy-dependent process. The degradation of such proteins was studied in cellfree extracts prepared by treatment with lysozyme and osmotic shock after freezing and thawing. In such extracts, the nonsense fragment of P-galactosidase 545 (assayed by auto-a complementation) disappeared by a process that ceased after several minutes unless ATP was added. These same preparations also hydrolyzed [‘4C]methylapohemoglobin to acid-soluble material by an ATP-stimulated process. The systems responsible for hydrolysis of [‘%]methylglobin and the disappearance of auto-a activity appear identical by many criteria. Maximal stimulation of both was obtained with 3 mM ATP. Other nucleotide triphosphates and ADP caused less stimulation than ATP. AMP, NAD, NADH, guanosine tetraphosphate, and a, p, and y-methylene ATP did not have significant effects. The rates of degradation of both substrates were maximal around pH 8.0 with and without ATP. The ATP-stimulated activity was recovered in the 100,000 x g supernatant. ATP had no effect on the proteolytic activity in the periplasmic fraction. The stimulatory effect of ATP was lost after preincubation at 40°C or upon storage of the extracts. EDTA and diisopropyl fluorophosphate strongly inhibited degradation of [%]methylglobin and the disappearance of 545. N-Ethylmaleimide caused some inhibition which was greater in the presence of ATP. Degstrains have a reduced capacity to degrade abnormal proteins. In extracts of deg+ and degcells, ATP stimulated the breakdown of globin and loss of 545. However, the degextracts hydrolyzed [‘4C]methylglobin more slowly than those from deg’ cells. Nonsense fragments with much longer in uiuo half-lives than 545 appeared more stable than 545 in these extracts. The rate of degradation of [‘4C]methylhemoglobin was more rapid after extraction of its heme moiety. This degradative system"

https://openalex.org/W2063155867,"Discharges of Purkinje cells were recorded from the vermis, lobules VI and VII, of a monkey trained to track a visual target. When the monkey tracked a sinusoidally oscillating target, cellular activity changes in phase with the velocity signal of the eye movement. When the monkey fixated a stationary point, almost identical modulation in activity occurred, reflecting the velocity signal of the motion of the retinal image of the target. The data suggest that the vermis participates in the control of smooth pursuit eye movements by providing the oculomotor system with the actual target velocity information which is the sum of eye velocity and retinal image velocity signals."

Its synthesis is induced by myo-inositol and repressed by D-glucose. The enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 155,000 to 160,000 as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and it is comprised of four subunits, each having a molecular weight of 39,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The isoelectric point of the enzyme is 4.4 as determined by column isoelectric focusing. The enzyme shows the highest Vmax and lowest Km with myo-inositol as substrate but does not react with scyllo-inositol; it also reacts with the alpha anomer (but not the beta anomer) of D-glucose and with D-xylose. Apparently, the enzyme can remove only the single equatorial hydrogen of the cyclitol or pyranose ring. In contrast to the glucose dehydrogenase of spores, which reacts with D-glucose or 2-deoxy-D-glucose and with NAD or NADP, inositol dehydrogenase requires NAD and does not react with 2-deoxy-D-glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1507895096,"Endo-beta-galactosidase, a glycosidase that hydrolyzes Gal beta 1-4 GlcNAc linkages in glycoconjugates, has been used to probe the plasma membrane of human erythrocytes. Coomassie blue staining of stroma components separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that treatment of red cells with endo-beta-galactosidase converts Protein 3, the anion transporter of the erythrocyte, to a more compact staining band. No other components detected by Coomassie staining are affected. Following labeling of red cells with galactose oxidase + NaB3H4, 45 to 50% of the [3H]galactose residues can be released by endo-beta-galactosidase. In contrast, only 5% of the label incorporated by treatment with periodate + NaB3H4, can be removed. [3H]Galactose residues are released from three components: Protein 3, Band 4.5, and the megaloglycolipids. The susceptibility of these components to endo-beta-galactosidase, together with the high content of Gal and GlcNAc present in Protein 3 and the megaloglycolipids, suggests that the erythrocyte membrane contains several components with N-acetyllactosamine repeating units, a structure commonly found in connective tissue glycoconjugates."

https://openalex.org/W1500659390,"Quantitative aspects and structure-activity relationships of the inducing effects of natural steroids on delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase and porphyrins have been investigated in monolayer cultures of chick embryo liver cells maintained in a serum-free medium as well as in the chick embryo liver in ovo. Many 5 alpha and 5 beta metabolites of neutral C-19 and C-21 hormones and hormone precursors stimulated porphyrin formation and ALA-synthase induction in the cultured liver cells as we have previously described. In these inducing actions a number of 5 beta epimers (A:B cis) were found to be more potent than their corresponding 5 alpha epimers (A:B trans). The structure-activity relationship between 5 beta and 5 alpha steroid epimers with respect to ALA-synthase induction in culture was also found to prevail with respect to induction of this enzyme in chick embryo liver in ovo. Hemin in concentrations of 2 x 10(-7) M inhibited steroid induction of porphyrin formation, and CaMgEDTA enhanced the responsiveness of the cultured liver cells to steroids by approximately 10 times. The addition of insulin, or insulin plus hydrocortisone or insulin plus hydrocortisone plus triiodothyronine, was important for the maintenance of protein synthesis and essential for maximal expression of the ability of steroids to induce porphyrins and ALA-synthase in the permissive effect which insulin, hydrocortisone, and triiodothyronine exert on allylisopropylacetamide induction of porphyrins and ALA-synthase also extends to the induction process which is elicited by natural steroids. These findings also strongly suggest that the regulation of hepatic porphyrin-heme biosynthesis by endogenous as well as exogenous chemicals is significantly influenced by the internal hormonal milieu."
https://openalex.org/W1519697459,"The DNA polymerase of early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster has been purified to near-homogeneity. The purified enzyme gave a single, catalytically active protein band after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under nondenaturing conditions. Four polypeptides with molecular weights 43,000, 46,000, 58,000, and 148,000 were resolved when this band was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions. At high ionic strengths, the DNA polymerase had a sedimentation coefficient of 8.7 S, a Stokes radius of 78 A and frictional ratio of 1.81, parameters that yield a molecular weight of 280,000. The purified DNA polymerase possessed no detectable endo- or exodeoxyribonuclease, ATPase, or RNA polymerase activity. Using an ""activated"" DNA template-primer, the enzyme had a pH optimum of 8.5. It was stimulated by (NH4)2SO4, KCl, and to a lesser extent, NaCl. A divalent metal cation was absolutely required; MgCl2 stimulating activity 7-fold more than MnCl2. It was inhibited by low concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide and Aphidicolon.

https://openalex.org/W2035551901,"Using deficiencies in D. melanogaster that lack either the 87A or 87C heat-induced puffs, we have shown that the 70,000 dalton heat-induced protein (hsp 70) is encoded at both these loci. Embryos deleted for one of the two loci retain the ability to make hsp 70 after heat shock, but deleting both loci eliminates synthesis of hsp 70. Thus both loci encode hsp 70 and can be active following heat shock. We have analyzed the proteins made by embryos lacking either 87A or 87C, and have compared the 87A- and 87C-coded hsp 70 by isoelectric focusing and tryptic peptide fingerprinting. The hsp 70 made by the two loci is very similar, although a variant tryptic peptide appears to be encoded only at 87C. Using deficiencies with slightly different breakpoints, we have mapped the 87A locus to band 87A7, the site of the 87A heat-induced puff. The 87C locus maps within 87C1."

The galactose-specific lectin does not promote aggregation, but prevents the antiaggregation receptor from disaggregating cell clumps. Competition experiments showed that the lectin inactivates the antiaggregation receptor by binding to it, most likely via its terminal galactose residues. The lectin converts reversibly aggregation-deficient cells (carrying functional cell membrane-bound antiaggregation receptor molecules) to aggregation-susceptible cells."

https://openalex.org/W1540734158,"Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase from Rhodospirillum rubrum requires CO2 and Mg2+ for activation of both CO2, both the carboxylase and oxygenase activities are stimulated by 6-phoshpo-D-gluconate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 2-phosphoglycolate, 3-phosphoglycerate, NADPH, and fructose 6-phosphate. The carboxylase activity is not activated by ribose 5-phosphate. The substrate, ribulose bisphosphate, neither activates nor inhibits the CO2 and Mg2+ activation of this enzyme. Activation by CO2 and Mg2+ is rapid and results in increased susceptibility to active-site-directed protein modification reagents. Because the R. rubrum carboxylase-oxygenase is a dimer of large subunits and contains no small subunits, these results suggest that the effector binding sites of the higher plant enzyme may also be found on the large subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1559717664,"Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), prepared from human serum by an improved purification method, was treated with a mixture of neuraminidase, beta-galactosidase, alpha-mannosidase, and beta-N-aectylglucosaminidase, which resulted in the removal of approximately 86% of saccharides. Purification by thyroxine-Sepharose affinity chromatography gave a homogeneous protein as shown by equilibrium sedimentation and sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amino acid and NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicated that the protein moiety was intact. Deglycosylation had no effect on the stoichiometry of the binding of L-thyroxine as shown by tryptophanyl fluorescence quenching and equilibrium dialysis at pH 8.6 and 25 degrees C. However, the affinity constant for L-thyroxine was reduced from 1.6 X 10(9) M-1 to 0.58 X 10(9) M-1. Analysis of radioimmunoassay data revealed that deglycosylation resulted in a slight decrease of the affinity constant for anti-TBG antibody from 3.9 X 10(10) M-1 to 1.8 X 10(10) M-1. These results suggest that the polypeptide moiety, rather than the heterosaccharides, contains the antigenic determinants. Removal of the majority of the heterosaccharides of TBG has only a minor effect on its immunoreactivity and on the binding of thyroid hormone."

Km for purified enzyme was 35 microM and Vmax was 2.2 mumol of bilirubin diglucuronide formed/min/mg of protein. Freshly biosynthesized bilirubin monoglucuronide was injected intravenously into homozygous Gunn rats which had bile duct cannulation. Gunn rats lack UDP-glucuronate glucuronyltransferase activity (EC 2.4.1.17), have normal bilirubin glucuronoside glucuronosyltransferase activity, cannot form bilirubin monoglucuronide in vitro or in vivo, and do not excrete bilirubin glucuronides after intravenous injection of unconjugated bilirubin. Within 1 h, approximately 75% of the injected conjugated bilirubin was recovered in bile, of which 20% consisted of bilirubin diglucuronide. These results indicate that bilirubin glucuronide glucuronosyltransferase catalyzes conversion of bilirubin monoglucuronide to diglucuronide in vivo."

This subpopulation, designated alpha(129-141) anti-hemoglobin antibodies, represents less than 1% of the total anti-hemoglobin antibodies. They are nonprecipitating by Ouchterlony analysis, and fluorescence-quenching studies demonstrate the interaction of a single antibody binding site per hemoglobin dimer. These antibodies bind preferentially to carboxyhemoglobin with a median affinity constant of 5 X 10(8) M-1 compared to binding to deoxyhemoglobin with a binding affinity of less than 1 X 10(8) M-1. Furthermore, the presence of these antibodies in stoichiometric amounts increases the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, and thus antibody and oxygen binding to hemoglobin can be considered as a linked function."

Incorporation of label into CO2, glycogen, RNA, alanine, glutamate, glycine, lipid glycerol, and lipid fatty acids was measured 20, 40, and 60 min after the start of the incubation. To develop a model suitable for quantitative analysis of the data, it was necessary to join two preceding models, one for carbohydrate-metabolizing cells and one for acetate-metabolizing cells, eliminating the over-simplified sections of each. Equations were written and programmed for a digital computer to allow computation of the amount of label expected to be incorporated into any of the products measured for any given set of steady state flux values in the metabolic network. The model formed by simply joining the two preceding models did not yield satisfactory agreement with the complete data obtained in the present study, although each partial set of data could be fit well by the appropriate partial model. Analysis of the ways in which the model failed to yield good fits to the data indicated that another pool of P-enolpyruvate, of pyruvate, and of acetyl-CoA had to be added at the junction of the two models. The presence of such poolte into fatty acids as compared to the incorporation of label from glucose into fatty acids. A new model was therefore constructed which differed from the preceding model only in its structural organization at the level of P-enolpyruvate, pyruvate, and acetyl-CoA. The model is consistent with all known information on the compartmental structure of metabolism in Tetrahymena, on enzyme localization, and on the enzyme complement of this cell. Over 70 measurements of label incorporation into products were made at each time. These, plus a large number of limit measurements which constrain any possible solutions, were in sufficient excess of the 39 independent flux values to permit a stringent assessment of the model. A set of flux values was found which yielded a good fit to the data. These flux values therefore provide a quantitative description of metabolite flux in the intact cell during the slow adaptation to the nine-substrate mixture. The rates of utilization of glucose, fructose, glycerol, and ribose were in the ratio of about 10:1:0.33:0.16, i.e. fairly similar to the ratio observed with carbohydrate-metabolizing cells. Initial flux through phosphofructokinase is about 160 nmol/10(6) cells.h, increasing over 3-fold during tje jpir incubation. Initial flux through fructose-1,6-diphosphatase is about 110 nmol/10(6) cells.h and also increases almost 3-fold during the incubation. Thus net flux is glycolytic and increases 4-fold during the hour with a large amount of futile cycling at this step..."

https://openalex.org/W1480415563,"Previous studies have described a partially defined system for the DNA-directed in vitro synthesis of beta-galactosidase (Kung, H.F., Redfield, B., Treadwell, B.V., Eskin, B., Spears, C., and Weissbach, H. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6889-6894). An Ehrlich ascites extract was shown in these in vitro studies to acylate Escherichia coli tRNA with 13 amino acids, and the ascites extract was used in place of the corresponding 13 E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The present studies indicate that the ascites extract is supplying an additional protein factor, besides the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, that stimulates the DNA-directed synthesis of beta-galactosidase. The protein factor has been highly purified and may be functioning by protecting mRNA against degradation. In addition, NAD or T4 DNA ligase stimulates the synthesis of beta-galactosidase in the partially defined system."
https://openalex.org/W1490747824,"The sequence of the lambda light chain of the Bur IgA1 molecule has been determined. It comprises 214 amino acid residues with a blocked NH2 terminus and lacks carbohydrate. The V-region sequence is of the VlambdaII subgroup and contains the coupled interchanges Arg-7 and Cys-87. The Lv3 region is comparatively short and hydrophobic in nature and lends support for the designation of this area as a hypervariable deletion region. The C-region exhibits the Mcg+ Kren+ Oz- isotypes. These appear coupled with substitution at position 100 (in the V-region). The pattern of nonrandom association of V- and C-regions and H and L chains is discussed in terms of the generation of antibody diversity. With the companion papers in this series, the complete primary structure of a human IgA1 molecule is established."

Radiolabeled precursor heavy and light chains, purified by immunoprecipitation and preparative gel electrophoresis, were subjected to Edman degradation. The labeled phenylthiohydantoin derivatives obtained in each degradative cycle were identified and quantitated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Both heavy and light chain precursor segments were hydrophobic in nature; however, they were not homolgous in sequence. To establish whether COOH-terminal proteolytic processing of the heavy chain might also be occurring during secretion, the cyanogen bromide peptides of the heavy chain precursor were compared to those of the mature secreted heavy chain. The results indicated that the COOH termini of the two chains were identical."

Hence, modulation of enzyme release is indirectly mediated by the activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1521070193,"Prephenate dehydratase from Bacillus subtilis was found to exist in three states of aggregation. A high molecular weight (210,000) species was fully active and the catalytic activity was unaffected by the effectors methionine or phenylalanine. Low concentrations of phenylalanine caused dissociation to a Mr = 55,000 dimer. Heating to 32 degrees C also caused dissociation, but cooling and adding substrate or methionine favored association. When no effectors were present the enzyme eluted from Sephadex columns as a monomer. Both methionine and phenylalanine shifted the equilibrium from the inactive monomer to the active dimeric enzyme. In the presence of a saturating methionine concentration, the dimer possessed the same high activity as did the 210,000-dalton form. Phenylalanine inhibited the dimer, but not the higher molecular weight form. A model involving only three types of sites (catalytic, association-activation, and inhibition) is consistent with the data. It is proposed that phenylalanine is the preferred metabolite for binding both effector sites on the dimer; it binds the association-activation site with higher affinity than the inhibition site, but binding at the latter site has a greater effect on the catalytic rate. Methionine, like phenylalanine, has a hydrophobic side chain but is accommodated only at the association-activation site."
