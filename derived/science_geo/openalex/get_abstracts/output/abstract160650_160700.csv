https://openalex.org/W2140279570,"Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS)/DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) is a human disorder characterized by a number of phenotypic features including cardiovascular defects. Most VCFS/DGS patients are hemizygous for a 1.5-3.0 Mb region of 22q11. To investigate the etiology of this disorder, we used a cre-loxP strategy to generate mice that are hemizygous for a 1.5 Mb deletion corresponding to that on 22q11. These mice exhibit significant perinatal lethality and have conotruncal and parathyroid defects. The conotruncal defects can be partially rescued by a human BAC containing the TBX1 gene. Mice heterozygous for a null mutation in Tbx1 develop conotruncal defects. These results together with the expression patterns of Tbx1 suggest a major role for this gene in the molecular etiology of VCFS/DGS."
https://openalex.org/W2029245198,"During corticogenesis, early-born neurons of the preplate and layer 6 are important for guiding subsequent neuronal migrations and axonal projections. Tbr1 is a putative transcription factor that is highly expressed in glutamatergic early-born cortical neurons. In Tbr1-deficient mice, these early-born neurons had molecular and functional defects. Cajal-Retzius cells expressed decreased levels of Reelin, resulting in a reeler-like cortical migration disorder. Impaired subplate differentiation was associated with ectopic projection of thalamocortical fibers into the basal telencephalon. Layer 6 defects contributed to errors in the thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and callosal projections. These results show that Tbr1 is a common genetic determinant for the differentiation of early-born glutamatergic neocortical neurons and provide insights into the functions of these neurons as regulators of cortical development."
https://openalex.org/W2164316007,"The mechanisms by which neural stem cells give rise to neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes are beginning to be elucidated. However, it is not known how the specification of one cell lineage results in the suppression of alternative fates. We find that in addition to inducing neurogenesis, the bHLH transcription factor neurogenin (Ngn1) inhibits the differentiation of neural stem cells into astrocytes. While Ngn1 promotes neurogenesis by functioning as a transcriptional activator, Ngn1 inhibits astrocyte differentiation by sequestering the CBP-Smad1 transcription complex away from astrocyte differentiation genes, and by inhibiting the activation of STAT transcription factors that are necessary for gliogenesis. Thus, two distinct mechanisms are involved in the activation and suppression of gene expression during cell-fate specification by neurogenin."
https://openalex.org/W2090782551,"We used functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging to measure brain activity during delay between reward-related decisions and their outcomes, and the modulation of this delay activity by uncertainty and arousal. Feedback, indicating financial gain or loss, was given following a fixed delay. Anticipatory arousal was indexed by galvanic skin conductance. Delay-period activity was associated with bilateral activation in orbital and medial prefrontal, temporal, and right parietal cortices. During delay, activity in anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices was modulated by outcome uncertainty, whereas anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, and parietal cortices activity was modulated by degree of anticipatory arousal. A distinct region of anterior cingulate was commonly activated by both uncertainty and arousal. Our findings highlight distinct contributions of cognitive uncertainty and autonomic arousal to anticipatory neural activity in prefrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2122170158,"Virus attachment to cells plays an essential role in viral tropism and disease. Reovirus serotypes 1 and 3 differ in the capacity to target distinct cell types in the murine nervous system and in the efficiency to induce apoptosis. The binding of viral attachment protein σ1 to unidentified receptors controls these phenotypes. We used expression cloning to identify junction adhesion molecule (JAM), an integral tight junction protein, as a reovirus receptor. JAM binds directly to σ1 and permits reovirus infection of nonpermissive cells. Ligation of JAM is required for reovirus-induced activation of NF-κB and apoptosis. Thus, reovirus interaction with cell-surface receptors is a critical determinant of both cell-type specific tropism and virus-induced intracellular signaling events that culminate in cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2117403504,"The major pathways of mRNA turnover in eukaryotes initiate with shortening of the poly(A) tail. We demonstrate by several criteria that CCR4 and CAF1 encode critical components of the major cytoplasmic deadenylase in yeast. First, both Ccr4p and Caf1p are required for normal mRNA deadenylation in vivo. Second, both proteins localize to the cytoplasm. Third, purification of Caf1p copurifies with a Ccr4p-dependent poly(A)-specific exonuclease activity. We also provide evidence that the Pan2p/Pan3p nuclease complex encodes the predominant alternative deadenylase. These results, and previous work on Pan2p/Pan3p, define the mRNA deadenylases in yeast. The strong conservation of Ccr4p, Caf1p, Pan2p, and Pan3p indicates that they will function as deadenylases in other eukaryotes. Interestingly, because Ccr4p and Caf1p interact with transcription factors, these results suggest an unexpected link between mRNA synthesis and turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2135207143,"We have addressed the role of the proneural bHLH genes Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) and Mash1 in the selection of neuronal and glial fates by neural stem cells. We show that mice mutant for both genes present severe defects in development of the cerebral cortex, including a reduction of neurogenesis and a premature and excessive generation of astrocytic precursors. An analysis of wild-type and mutant cortical progenitors in culture showed that a large fraction of Ngn2; Mash1 double-mutant progenitors failed to adopt a neuronal fate, instead remaining pluripotent or entering an astrocytic differentiation pathway. Together, these results demonstrate that proneural genes are involved in lineage restriction of cortical progenitors, promoting the acquisition of the neuronal fate and inhibiting the astrocytic fate."
https://openalex.org/W2039285533,"The long bones of the vertebrate appendicular skeleton arise from initially continuous condensations of mesenchymal cells that subsequently segment and cavitate to form discrete elements separated by synovial joints. Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms of joint formation. We present evidence that Wnt-14 plays a central role in initiating synovial joint formation in the chick limb. Wnt-14 is expressed in joint-forming regions prior to the segmentation of the cartilage elements, and local misexpression of Wnt-14 induces morphological and molecular changes characteristic of the first steps of joint formation. Induction of an ectopic joint-like region by Wnt-14 suppresses the formation of the immediately adjacent endogenous joint, potentially providing insight into the spacing of joints."
https://openalex.org/W2112718635,"Abstract When surface epithelium was conditionally targeted for ablation of α-catenin, hair follicle development was blocked and epidermal morphogenesis was dramatically affected, with defects in adherens junction formation, intercellular adhesion, and epithelial polarity. Differentiation occurred, but epidermis displayed hyperproliferation, suprabasal mitoses, and multinucleated cells. In vitro, α-catenin null keratinocytes were poorly contact inhibited and grew rapidly. These differences were not dependent upon intercellular adhesion and were in marked contrast to keratinocytes conditionally null for another essential intercellular adhesion protein, desmoplakin (DP). KO keratinocytes exhibited sustained activation of the Ras-MAPK cascade due to aberrations in growth factor responses. Thus, remarkably, features of precancerous lesions often attributed to defects in cell cycle regulatory genes can be generated by compromising the function of α-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W2075247632,"The cortical mechanisms associated with conscious object recognition were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were required to recognize pictures of masked objects that were presented very briefly, randomly and repeatedly. This design yielded a gradual accomplishment of successful recognition. Cortical activity in a ventrotemporal visual region was linearly correlated with perception of object identity. Therefore, although object recognition is rapid, awareness of an object's identity is not a discrete phenomenon but rather associated with gradually increasing cortical activity. Furthermore, the focus of the activity in the temporal cortex shifted anteriorly as subjects reported an increased knowledge regarding identity. The results presented here provide new insights into the processes underlying explicit object recognition, as well as the analysis that takes place immediately before and after recognition is possible."
https://openalex.org/W2130525093,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomere binding protein Cdc13 mediates telomere replication by recruiting telomerase, and also performs an essential function in chromosome end protection. We show here that delivery of the Stn1 protein to the telomere, by fusing the DNA binding domain of Cdc13 (DBDCDC13) to Stn1, is sufficient to rescue the lethality of a cdc13 null strain and, hence, provide end protection. Telomere replication is still defective in this strain, but can be restored by delivering telomerase to the telomere as a DBDCDC13-telomerase fusion. These results establish Stn1 as the primary effector of chromosome end protection, whereas the principal function of Cdc13 is to provide a loading platform to recruit complexes that provide end protection and telomere replication."
https://openalex.org/W1983983875,"Spinal interneurons help to coordinate motor behavior. During spinal cord development, distinct classes of interneurons are generated from progenitor cells located at different positions within the ventral neural tube. V0 and V1 interneurons derive from adjacent progenitor domains that are distinguished by expression of the homeodomain proteins Dbx1 and Dbx2. The spatially restricted expression of Dbx1 has a critical role in establishing the distinction in V0 and V1 neuronal fate. In Dbx1 mutant mice, neural progenitors fail to generate V0 neurons and instead give rise to interneurons that express many characteristics of V1 neurons—their transcription factor profile, neurotransmitter phenotype, migratory pattern, and aspects of their axonal trajectory. Thus, a single progenitor homeodomain transcription factor coordinates many of the differentiated properties of one class of interneurons generated in the ventral spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2080865232,"When a kinase inactive form of Protein Kinase D (PKD-K618N) was expressed in HeLa cells, it localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and caused extensive tubulation. Cargo that was destined for the plasma membrane was found in PKD-K618N-containing tubes but the tubes did not detach from the TGN. As a result, the transfer of cargo from TGN to the plasma membrane was inhibited. We have also demonstrated the formation and subsequent detachment of cargo-containing tubes from the TGN in cells stably expressing low levels of PKD-K618N. Our results suggest that PKD regulates the fission from the TGN of transport carriers that are en route to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2163872057,"vvd, a gene regulating light responses in Neurospora, encodes a novel member of the PAS/LOV protein superfamily. VVD defines a circadian clock-associated autoregulatory feedback loop that influences light resetting, modulates circadian gating of input by connecting output and input, and regulates light adaptation. Rapidly light induced, vvd is an early repressor of light-regulated processes. Further, vvd is clock controlled; the clock gates light induction of vvd and the clock gene frq so identical signals yield greater induction in the morning. Mutation of vvd severely dampens gating, especially of frq, consistent with VVD modulating gating and phasing light-resetting responses. vvd null strains display distinct alterations in the phase-response curve to light. Thus VVD, although not part of the clock, contributes significantly to regulation within the Neurospora circadian system."
https://openalex.org/W2005353346,"Cancer cells show increased genome rearrangements, although it is unclear what defects cause these rearrangements. Mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC5, DPB11, MEC1, DDC2 MEC3, RAD53, CHK1, PDS1, and DUN1 increased the rate of genome rearrangements up to 200-fold whereas mutations in RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, BUB3, and MAD3 had little effect. The rearrangements were primarily deletion of a portion of a chromosome arm along with TEL1-dependent addition of a new telomere. tel1 mutations increased the proportion of translocations observed, and in some cases showed synergistic interactions when combined with mutations that increased the genome rearrangement rate. These data suggest that one role of S phase checkpoint functions in normal cells is to suppress spontaneous genome rearrangements resulting from DNA replication errors."
https://openalex.org/W1984322059,"To study the mechanisms underlying the high pathogenicity of Ebola virus, we have established a system that allows the recovery of infectious virus from cloned cDNA and thus permits genetic manipulation. We created a mutant in which the editing site of the gene encoding envelope glycoprotein (GP) was eliminated. This mutant no longer expressed the nonstructural glycoprotein sGP. Synthesis of GP increased, but most of it accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum as immature precursor. The mutant was significantly more cytotoxic than wild-type virus, indicating that cytotoxicity caused by GP is down-regulated by the virus through transcriptional RNA editing and expression of sGP."
https://openalex.org/W2156029588,"Filopodia that extend from neuronal growth cones sample the environment for extracellular guidance cues, but the signals they transmit to growth cones are unknown. Filopodia were observed generating localized transient elevations of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) that propagate back to the growth cone and stimulate global Ca2+ elevations. The frequency of filopodial Ca2+ transients was substrate-dependent and may be due in part to influx of Ca2+ through channels activated by integrin receptors. These transients slowed neurite outgrowth by reducing filopodial motility and promoted turning when stimulated differentially within filopodia on one side of the growth cone. These rapid signals appear to serve both as autonomous regulators of filopodial movement and as frequency-coded signals integrated within the growth cone and could be a common signaling process for many motile cells."
https://openalex.org/W2122643181,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic efficacy, considered a model of learning and memory. The biochemical cascade producing LTP requires activation of Src, which upregulates the function of NMDA receptors (NMDARs), but how Src becomes activated is unknown. Here, we show that the focal adhesion kinase CAKbeta/Pyk2 upregulated NMDAR function by activating Src in CA1 hippocampal neurons. Induction of LTP was prevented by blocking CAKbeta/Pyk2, and administering CAKbeta/Pyk2 intracellularly mimicked and occluded LTP. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CAKbeta/Pyk2 and its association with Src was increased by stimulation that produced LTP. Finally, CAKbeta/Pyk2-stimulated enhancement of synaptic AMPA responses was prevented by blocking NMDARS, chelating intracellular Ca(2+), or blocking Src. Thus, activating CAKbeta/Pyk2 is required for inducing LTP and may depend upon downstream activation of Src to upregulate NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2071160562,"Inhibition of transmitter release by presynaptic receptors is widespread in the central nervous system and is typically mediated via metabotropic receptors. In contrast, very little is known about facilitatory receptors, and synaptic activation of a facilitatory autoreceptor has not been established. Here we show that activation of presynaptic kainate receptors can facilitate transmitter release from hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. Synaptic activation of these presumed ionotropic kainate receptors is very fast (<10 ms) and lasts for seconds. Thus, these presynaptic kainate receptors contribute to the short-term plasticity characteristics of mossy fiber synapses, which were previously thought to be an intrinsic property of the synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2104175189,"Brief periods of electrical stimulation of cultured Xenopus spinal neurons resulted in a marked alteration in the turning responses of the growth cone induced by gradients of attractive or repulsive guidance cues. Netrin-1-induced attraction was enhanced, and the repulsion induced by myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) or myelin membrane fragments was converted to attraction. The effect required the presence of extracellular Ca(2+) during electrical stimulation and appeared to be mediated by an elevation of both cytoplasmic Ca(2+) and cAMP. Thus, electrical activity may influence the axonal path finding of developing neurons, and intermittent electrical stimulation may be effective in promoting nerve regeneration after injury."
https://openalex.org/W2006169062,"Interneurons in the ventral spinal cord are essential for coordinated locomotion in vertebrates. During embryogenesis, the V0 and V1 classes of ventral interneurons are defined by expression of the homeodomain transcription factors Evx1/2 and En1, respectively. In this study, we show that Evx1 V0 interneurons are locally projecting intersegmental commissural neurons. In Evx1 mutant embryos, the majority of V0 interneurons fail to extend commissural axons. Instead, they adopt an En1-like ipsilateral axonal projection and ectopically express En1, indicating that V0 interneurons are transfated to a V1 identity. Conversely, misexpression of Evx1 represses En1, suggesting that Evx1 may suppress the V1 interneuron differentiation program. Our findings demonstrate that Evx1 is a postmitotic determinant of V0 interneuron identity and reveal a critical postmitotic phase for neuronal determination in the developing spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2092602533,"Genetic mechanisms regulating CNS progenitor function and differentiation are not well understood. We have used microarrays derived from a representational difference analysis (RDA) subtraction in a heterogeneous stem cell culture system to systematically study the gene expression patterns of CNS progenitors. This analysis identified both known and novel genes enriched in progenitor cultures. In situ hybridization in a subset of clones demonstrated that many of these genes were expressed preferentially in germinal zones, some showing distinct ventricular or subventricular zone labeling. Several genes were also enriched in hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting an overlap of gene expression in neural and hematopoietic progenitors. This combination of methods demonstrates the power of using custom microarrays derived from RDA-subtracted libraries for both gene discovery and gene expression analysis in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2126304021,"Circadian oscillations of clock gene products are thought to provide time-of-day signals that drive overt rhythms. In Drosophila, RNA and protein levels of the period and timeless genes oscillate and the proteins autoregulate their transcription. To test the relevance of these oscillations, we expressed period and timeless under control of constitutively active promoters. Constitutive expression of either RNA supported protein cycling and behavioral rhythms in the respective null mutant, although constitutive timeless was less effective than constitutive period. Constitutive expression of both genes restored behavioral rhythms that showed deficits in photic resetting and drove cyclic expression of the clock-controlled RNA, vrille. Overexpression of either period or timeless, but especially timeless, attenuated behavioral rhythmicity and protein cycling in lateral neurons. We propose that the two proteins must cycle to drive rhythmic expression of downstream genes."
https://openalex.org/W2126076154,"Netrins stimulate and orient axon growth through a mechanism requiring receptors of the DCC family. It has been unclear, however, whether DCC proteins are involved directly in signaling or are mere accessory proteins in a receptor complex. Further, although netrins bind cells expressing DCC, direct binding to DCC has not been demonstrated. Here we show that netrin-1 binds DCC and that the DCC cytoplasmic domain fused to a heterologous receptor ectodomain can mediate guidance through a mechanism involving derepression of cytoplasmic domain multimerization. Activation of the adenosine A2B receptor, proposed to contribute to netrin effects on axons, is not required for rat commissural axon outgrowth or Xenopus spinal axon attraction to netrin-1. Thus, DCC plays a central role in netrin signaling of axon growth and guidance independent of A2B receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2148663866,"beta-Lactamase and penicillin-binding protein 2a mediate staphylococcal resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, which are otherwise highly clinically effective. Production of these inducible proteins is regulated by a signal-transducing integral membrane protein and a transcriptional repressor. The signal transducer is a fusion protein with penicillin-binding and zinc metalloprotease domains. The signal for protein expression is transmitted by site-specific proteolytic cleavage of both the transducer, which autoactivates, and the repressor, which is inactivated, unblocking gene transcription. Compounds that disrupt this regulatory pathway could restore the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics against drug-resistant strains of staphylococci."
https://openalex.org/W2098434647,"Formation of glutamatergic synapses entails development of ""silent"" immature contacts into mature functional synapses. To determine how this transformation occurs, we investigated the development of neurotransmission at single synapses in vitro. Maturation of presynaptic function, assayed with endocytotic markers, followed accumulation of synapsin I. During this period, synaptic transmission was primarily mediated by activation of NMDA receptors, suggesting that most synapses were functionally silent. However, local glutamate application to silent synapses indicated that these synapses contained functional AMPA receptors, suggesting a possible presynaptic locus for silent transmission. Interference with presynaptic vesicle fusion by exposure to tetanus toxin reverted functional to silent transmission, implicating SNARE-mediated fusion as a determinant of the ratio of NMDA:AMPA receptor activation. This work reveals that functional maturation of synaptic transmission involves transformation of presynaptic silent secretion into mature synaptic transmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2094578138,"Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) binds to neuropilin-1 (NP1) and activates the transmembrane Plexin to transduce a repulsive axon guidance signal. Here, we show that Sema3 signals are transduced equally effectively by PlexinA1 or PlexinA2, but not by PlexinA3. Deletion analysis of the PlexinA1 ectodomain demonstrates that the sema domain prevents PlexinA1 activation in the basal state. Sema-deleted PlexinA1 is constitutively active, producing cell contraction, growth cone collapse, and inhibition of neurite outgrowth. The sema domain of PlexinA1 physically associates with the remainder of the PlexinA1 ectodomain and can reverse constitutive activation. Both the sema portion and the remainder of the ectodomain of PlexinA1 associate with NP1 in a Sema3A-independent fashion. Plexin A1 is autoinhibited by its sema domain, and Sema3A/NP1 releases this inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2113507419,"We examined the frame of reference of auditory responses in the inferior colliculus in monkeys fixating visual stimuli at different locations. Eye position modulated the level of auditory responses in 33% of the neurons we encountered, but it did not appear to shift their spatial tuning. The effect of eye position on auditory responses was substantial-comparable in magnitude to that of sound location. The eye position signal appeared to interact with the auditory responses in at least a partly multiplicative fashion. We conclude that the representation of sound location in primate IC is distributed and that the frame of reference is intermediate between head- and eye-centered coordinates. The information contained in these neurons appears to be sufficient for later neural stages to calculate the positions of sounds with respect to the eyes."
https://openalex.org/W2053816989,"In the visual cortex of many mammals, orientation preference changes smoothly along the cortical surface, with the exception of singularities such as pinwheels and fractures. The reason for the existence of these singularities has remained elusive, suggesting that they are developmental artifacts. We show that singularities reduce the length of intracortical neuronal connections for some connection rules. Therefore, pinwheels and fractures could be evolutionary adaptations keeping cortical volume to a minimum. Wire length minimization approach suggests that interspecies differences in orientation preference maps reflect differences in intracortical neuronal circuits, thus leading to experimentally testable predictions. We discuss application of our model to direction preference maps."
https://openalex.org/W2079337067,"Mutations in the no-mechanoreceptor-potential A (nompA) gene, which eliminate transduction in Drosophila mechanosensory organs, disrupt contacts between neuronal sensory endings and cuticular structures. nompA encodes a transmembrane protein with a large, modular extracellular segment that includes a zona pellucida (ZP) domain and several plasminogen N-terminal (PAN) modules. It is specifically expressed in type I sense organs of the peripheral nervous system by the support cells that ensheath the neuronal sensory process. A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NompA fusion protein is localized to the dendritic cap, an extracellular matrix that covers the ciliary outer segment of the sensory process and that shows organizational defects in nompA mutants. The structure and location of NompA suggest that it forms part of a mechanical linkage required to transmit mechanical stimuli to the transduction apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2048375139,"We report that kainate receptors are present on presynaptic GABAergic terminals contacting interneurons and that their activation increases GABA release. Application of kainate increased the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded in CA1 interneurons. Local applications of glutamate but not of AMPA or NMDA also increased GABA quantal release. Application of kainate as well as synaptically released glutamate reduced the number of failures of GABAergic neurotransmission between interneurons. Thus, activation of presynaptic kainate receptors increases the probability of GABA release at interneuron–interneuron synapses. Glutamate may selectively control the communication between interneurons by increasing their mutual inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2007636457,"The Nodal and Hedgehog signaling pathways influence dorsoventral patterning at all axial levels of the CNS, but it remains largely unclear how these pathways interact to mediate patterning. Here we show that, in zebrafish, Nodal signaling is required for induction of the homeobox genes nk2.1a in the ventral diencephalon and nk2.1b in the ventral telencephalon. Hedgehog signaling is also required for telencephalic nk2.1b expression but may not be essential to establish diencephalic nk2.1a expression. Furthermore, Shh does not restore ventral diencephalic development in embryos lacking Nodal activity. In contrast, Shh does restore telencephalic nk2.1b expression in the absence of Nodal activity, suggesting that Hedgehog signaling acts downstream of Nodal activity to pattern the ventral telencephalon. Thus, the Nodal pathway regulates ventral forebrain patterning through both Hedgehog signaling-dependent and -independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1980886488,"Synaphin/complexin is a cytosolic protein that preferentially binds to syntaxin within the SNARE complex. We find that synaphin promotes SNAREs to form precomplexes that oligomerize into higher order structures. A peptide from the central, syntaxin binding domain of synaphin competitively inhibits these two proteins from interacting and prevents SNARE complexes from oligomerizing. Injection of this peptide into squid giant presynaptic terminals inhibited neurotransmitter release at a late prefusion step of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We propose that oligomerization of SNARE complexes into a higher order structure creates a SNARE scaffold for efficient, regulated fusion of synaptic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2010077156,"GADS is an adaptor protein implicated in CD3 signaling because of its ability to link SLP-76 to LAT. A GADS-deficient mouse was generated by gene targeting, and the function of GADS in T cell development and activation was examined. GADS- CD4-CD8- thymocytes exhibited a severe block in proliferation but still differentiated into mature T cells. GADS- thymocytes failed to respond to CD3 cross-linking in vivo and were impaired in positive and negative selection. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the association between SLP-76 and LAT was uncoupled in GADS- thymocytes. These observations indicate that GADS is a critical adaptor for CD3 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2045893690,"Inherited mutations of the TFIIH helicase subunits xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) B or XPD yield overlapping DNA repair and transcription syndromes. The high risk of cancer in these patients is not fully explained by the repair defect. The transcription defect is subtle and has proven more difficult to evaluate. Here, XPB and XPD mutations are shown to block transcription activation by the FUSE Binding Protein (FBP), a regulator of c-myc expression, and repression by the FBP Interacting Repressor (FIR). Through TFIIH, FBP facilitates transcription until promoter escape, whereas after initiation, FIR uses TFIIH to delay promoter escape. Mutations in TFIIH that impair regulation by FBP and FIR affect proper regulation of c-myc expression and have implications in the development of malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2121857983,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis plays a major role in retrieving synaptic vesicles from the plasma membrane following exocytosis. This endocytic process requires AP180 (or a homolog), which promotes the assembly and restricts the size of clathrin-coated vesicles. The highly conserved 33 kDa amino-terminal domain of AP180 plays a critical role in binding to phosphoinositides and in regulating the clathrin assembly activity of AP180. The crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain reported herein reveals a novel fold consisting of a large double layer of sheets of ten α helices and a unique site for binding phosphoinositides. The finding that the clathrin-box motif is mostly buried and lies in a helix indicates a different site and mechanism for binding of the domain to clathrins than previously assumed."
