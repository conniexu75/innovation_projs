This is counterbalanced by weakening of synapses during sleep (see the Perspective by Acsády). De Vivo et al. used serial scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct axon-spine interface and spine head volume in the mouse brain. They observed a substantial decrease in interface size after sleep. The largest relative changes occurred among weak synapses, whereas strong ones remained stable. Diering et al. found that synapses undergo changes in synaptic glutamate receptors during the sleep-wake cycle, driven by the immediate early gene Homer1a. In awake animals, Homer1a accumulates in neurons but is excluded from synapses by high levels of noradrenaline. At the onset of sleep, noradrenaline levels decline, allowing Homer1a to move to excitatory synapses and drive synapse weakening. Science , this issue p. 457 , p. 507 ; see also p. 511"

They form ring-shaped structures that encircle and topologically constrain DNA strands. Wang et al. show that Bacillus subtilis condensin complexes hold the two arms of the circular chromosome together (see the Perspective by Sherratt). The complexes seem to do this by encircling individual DNA duplexes and then tethering the two duplexes together by “handcuffing.” The complexes actively travel along the DNA and function to enlarge DNA loops processively, leading to chromosome compaction.

https://openalex.org/W2585495993,"Many diseases, especially cancers, result from aberrant or overexpression of pathogenic proteins. Specific inhibitors against these proteins have shown remarkable therapeutic effects, but these are limited mainly to enzymes. An alternative approach that may have utility in drug development relies on selective degradation of pathogenic proteins via small chimeric molecules linking an E3 ubiquitin ligase to the targeted protein for proteasomal degradation. To this end, we recently developed a protein knockdown system based on hybrid small molecule SNIPERs (Specific and Nongenetic IAP-dependent Protein Erasers) that recruit inhibitor of the apoptosis protein (IAP) ubiquitin ligases to specifically degrade targeted proteins. Here, we extend our previous study to show a proof of concept of the SNIPER technology in vivo By incorporating a high affinity IAP ligand, we developed a novel SNIPER against estrogen receptor α (ERα), SNIPER(ER)-87, that has a potent protein knockdown activity. The SNIPER(ER) reduced ERα levels in tumor xenografts and suppressed the growth of ERα-positive breast tumors in mice. Mechanistically, it preferentially recruits X-linked IAP (XIAP) rather than cellular IAP1, to degrade ERα via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. With this IAP ligand, potent SNIPERs against other pathogenic proteins, BCR-ABL, bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), and phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) could also be developed. These results indicate that forced ubiquitylation by SNIPERs is a useful method to achieve efficient protein knockdown with potential therapeutic activities and could also be applied to study the role of ubiquitylation in many cellular processes."

Existing data have shown the association and coordination between STATs and SMADs in mediating TGF-β functions in hepatic cells, but it is not clear how STATs are activated under these circumstances. Here, we report that JAK1 is a constitutive TGFβRI binding protein and is absolutely required for phosphorylation of STATs in a SMAD-independent manner within minutes of TGF-β stimulation. Following the activation of SMADs, TGF-β also induces a second phase of STAT phosphorylation that requires SMADs, de novo protein synthesis, and contribution from JAK1. Our global gene expression profiling indicates that the non-SMAD JAK1/STAT pathway is essential for the expression of a subset of TGF-β target genes in hepatic stellate cells, and the cooperation between the JAK1-STAT3 and SMAD pathways is critical to the roles of TGF-β in liver fibrosis.

The break ends can either be directly ligated by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or more accurately repaired by homologous recombination that uses information from the sister chromatid. Sibanda et al. present a high-resolution x-ray structure of a key component of the DNA repair machinery, the DNA-dependent kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), bound to a C-terminal peptide of Ku80. The structure suggests that Ku80 presents the DNA ends for repair to a DNA-PKcs dimer and that activity is modulated by interactions between the monomers. Binding of either Ku80 or BRCA1, which may compete for the same binding site on DNA-PKcs, could provide a switch between NHEJ and homologous recombination. Science , this issue p. 520"

Here, using electron cryomicroscopy, we have determined the structure of the 75-component yeast mitoribosome to an overall resolution of 3.3 angstroms. The mitoribosomal small subunit has been built de novo and includes 15S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 34 proteins, including 14 without homologs in the evolutionarily related bacterial ribosome. Yeast-specific rRNA and protein elements, including the acquisition of a putatively active enzyme, give the mitoribosome a distinct architecture compared to the mammalian mitoribosome. At an expanded messenger RNA channel exit, there is a binding platform for translational activators that regulate translation in yeast but not mammalian mitochondria. The structure provides insights into the evolution and species-specific specialization of mitochondrial translation."

https://openalex.org/W2583728075,"The aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) on lipid bilayers has been implicated as a mechanism by which Aβ exerts its toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lipid bilayer thinning has been observed during both oxidative stress and protein aggregation in AD, but whether these pathological modifications of the bilayer correlate with Aβ misfolding is unclear. Here, we studied peptide-lipid interactions in synthetic bilayers of the short-chain lipid dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) as a simplified model for diseased bilayers to determine their impact on Aβ aggregate, protofibril, and fibril formation. Aβ aggregation and fibril formation in membranes composed of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) or 1- palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine mimicking normal bilayers served as controls. Differences in aggregate formation and stability were monitored by a combination of thioflavin-T fluorescence, circular dichroism, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and NMR. Despite the ability of all three lipid bilayers to catalyze aggregation, DLPC accelerates aggregation at much lower concentrations and prevents the fibrillation of Aβ at low micromolar concentrations. DLPC stabilized globular, membrane-associated oligomers, which could disrupt the bilayer integrity. DLPC bilayers also remodeled preformed amyloid fibrils into a pseudo-unfolded, molten globule state, which resembled on-pathway, protofibrillar aggregates. Whereas the stabilized, membrane-associated oligomers were found to be nontoxic, the remodeled species displayed toxicity similar to that of conventionally prepared aggregates. These results provide mechanistic insights into the roles that pathologically thin bilayers may play in Aβ aggregation on neuronal bilayers, and pathological lipid oxidation may contribute to Aβ misfolding.

https://openalex.org/W2580733882,"Members of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family carry an agonistic sequence within their large ectodomains. Peptides derived from this region, called the Stachel sequence, can activate the respective receptor. As the conserved core region of the Stachel sequence is highly similar between aGPCRs, the agonist specificity of Stachel sequence-derived peptides was tested between family members using cell culture-based second messenger assays. Stachel peptides derived from aGPCRs of subfamily VI (GPR110/ADGRF1, GPR116/ADGRF5) and subfamily VIII (GPR64/ADGRG2, GPR126/ADGRG6) are able to activate more than one member of the respective subfamily supporting their evolutionary relationship and defining them as pharmacological receptor subtypes. Extended functional analyses of the Stachel sequences and derived peptides revealed agonist promiscuity, not only within, but also between aGPCR subfamilies. For example, the Stachel-derived peptide of GPR110 (subfamily VI) can activate GPR64 and GPR126 (both subfamily VIII). Our results indicate that key residues in the Stachel sequence are very similar between aGPCRs allowing for agonist promiscuity of several Stachel-derived peptides. Therefore, aGPCRs appear to be pharmacologically more closely related than previously thought. Our findings have direct implications for many aGPCR studies, as potential functional overlap has to be considered for in vitro and in vivo studies.

A novel evolutionarily conserved domain of cell-adhesion GPCRs mediates autoproteolysis.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1364-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Many aGPCRs seem to be autocatalytically cleaved at a motif within the GAIN domain, termed GPCR proteolysis site (GPS), yielding an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF) (10Lin H.-H. Chang G.-W. Davies J.Q. Stacey M. Harris J. Gordon S. Autocatalytic cleavage of the EMR2 receptor occurs at a conserved G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site motif.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31823-31832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). As the tethered peptide agonist comprises the sequence C-terminal of this designated cleavage site, it has been proposed that the cryptic tethered agonist is liberated through removal of the NTF (11Petersen S.C.

However, fully efficient cleavage is not a requirement for activation of all aGPCRs as in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that were using cleavage-impairing receptor variants (13Bohnekamp J.

However, there are even aGPCRs with a naturally disrupted cleavage motif such as GPR111/ADGRF2 and GPR115/ADGRF4 (15Prömel S. Waller-Evans H. Dixon J. Zahn D. Colledge W.H. Doran J. Carlton M.B.

Dyn. 2012; 241: 1591-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas GPR123/ADGRA1 lacks the GPS. The aGPCR GPR114/ADGRG5 harbors a cleavage motif, yet it does not release its NTF under in vitro conditions (16Wilde C. Fischer L. Lede V. Kirchberger J. Rothemund S. Schöneberg T. Liebscher I. The constitutive activity of the adhesion GPCR GPR114/ADGRG5 is mediated by its tethered agonist.FASEB J. 2016; 30: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For GPR114/ADGRG5 we postulated that there is a prebound state of the agonist, which isomerizes upon changes occurring at the NTF, e.g. ligand binding or mechanical force (16Wilde C. Fischer L. Lede V. Kirchberger J. Rothemund S. Schöneberg T. Liebscher I.

Tethered agonism: a common activation mechanism of adhesion GPCRs.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2016; 234: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Isomerization of a prebound ligand (retinal) is the classical activation scenario in rhodopsin. Even though peptides derived from GPR126 and GPR133 specifically activate the respective receptor (5Liebscher I. Schön J. Petersen S.C. Fischer L. Auerbach N. Demberg L.M. Mogha A. Cöster M. Simon K.U. Rothemund S. Monk K.R. Schöneberg T.

It is therefore conceivable that Stachel-derived peptides of closely related members have the ability to activate several aGPCRs. To test this hypothesis we investigated the potential Stachel sequence of the aGPCR subfamily VI (2Hamann J. Aust G. Araç D. Engel F.B. Formstone C. Fredriksson R. Hall R.A. Harty B.L. Kirchhoff C. Knapp B. Krishnan A. Liebscher I. Lin H.-H. Martinelli D.C. Monk K.R. et al.International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology: XCIV. adhesion G protein-coupled receptors.Pharmacol. Rev. 2015; 67: 338-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This subfamily comprises five receptor genes, Gpr110, Gpr111, Gpr113/ADGRF3, Gpr115, and Gpr116/ADGRF5, of which Gpr110, Gpr111, Gpr115, and Gpr116 cluster in mammalian genomes and have very likely emerged from one common ancestor during vertebrate evolution (15Prömel S. Waller-Evans H. Dixon J. Zahn D. Colledge W.H. Doran J. Carlton M.B. Grosse J. Schöneberg T. Russ A.P. Langenhan T. Characterization and functional study of a cluster of four highly conserved orphan adhesion-GPCR in mouse.Dev. Dyn. 2012; 241: 1591-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because of their high conservation and the availability of tissues from mice deficient for Gpr110, Gpr111, and Gpr115, this group is highly suitable for in-depth analyses of tethered agonist specificity. Here, we show that some peptides derived from the Stachel sequences of members of subfamily VI can activate not only the receptor of origin, but also others in in vitro expression systems and in tissues ex vivo. The observed agonist promiscuity seems to be common among aGPCRs because we identified additional examples in and between different aGPCR subfamilies. This knowledge is important for designing in vitro and in vivo studies dealing with the activation of aGPCRs. Our data suggest revising the current grouping into nine subfamilies because several aGPCRs should rather be referred to as pharmacological receptor subtypes than members of different subfamilies despite distinct differences in the 7-TM domain. Adhesion GPCR subfamily VI, consisting of the closely related aGPCRs GPR110, GPR111, GPR113/ADGRF3, GPR115, and GPR116, is an ideal assembly of receptors to study agonist specificity. The receptors GPR110, GPR111, GPR115, and GPR116 display high sequence similarities in the Stachel regions (Fig. 1A). Yet, GPR111 and GPR115 have a disrupted cleavage site preventing autoproteolysis (15Prömel S. Waller-Evans H. Dixon J. Zahn D. Colledge W.H. Doran J. Carlton M.B. Grosse J. Schöneberg T. Russ A.P. Langenhan T. Characterization and functional study of a cluster of four highly conserved orphan adhesion-GPCR in mouse.Dev. Dyn. 2012; 241: 1591-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas GPR110 and GPR116 harbor a classical cleavage motif. That cleavage indeed occurs as this motif has previously been shown for GPR116 (18Abe J. Fukuzawa T. Hirose S.

Western blot analyses of GPR110 constructs heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells revealed that this aGPCR is also cleaved at the GPS (Fig. 1B). We generated N and C terminally epitope-tagged versions of GPR110, GPR111, GPR115, and GPR116 for signal transduction assays. However, for GPR111 no cell surface expression was detected with or without the addition of an expression-enhancing Rho epitope (13Bohnekamp J. Schöneberg T. Cell adhesion receptor GPR133 couples to Gs protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 41912-41916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Therefore, GPR111 was omitted from further experiments of this study as GPR115 could also represent the features of the non-cleaved receptors of subfamily VI.TABLE 1Expression analysis of GPR110, GPR111, GPR115, and GPR116receptorN-terminal tagCell surface ELISAWhole cell ELISA% of pCMouse GPR110HA89.7 ± 18.198.2 ± 1.9Mouse GPR111HA1.6 ± 0.539.0 ± 19.1HA-Rho4.2 ± 2.472.9 ± 17.6Mouse GPR115HA75.7 ± 13.081.6 ± 3.9Mouse GPR116HA11.8 ± 11.481.5 ± 22.7HA-Rho99.1 ± 17.889.8 ± 7.2 Open table in a new tab Previously published data and our own studies suggest GPR110 (6Stoveken H.M.

Therefore, we used a cAMP formation assay (Gs), NFAT (the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells), and inositol 1-phosphate (IP1) assay (both assays monitor Gq activation) as read-outs for testing of Stachel-derived peptide libraries of GPR110, GPR116 and GPR115 (Figs. 1C and 2, A and C). Based on previous experiences with Stachel-derived peptides we used a standard concentration of 1 mm for all peptides of the libraries. GPR110 elicited a significant signal in cAMP accumulation and NFAT luciferase assays with Stachel sequence-derived peptides of 12 or more amino acids (aa). The best activation was found for a 13-AA long peptide (pGPR110) (Fig. 1C), which is in accordance with the previously identified agonist sequence by Stoveken et al. (6Stoveken H.M. Hajduczok A.G. Xu L. Tall G.G. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors are activated by exposure of a cryptic tethered agonist.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 6194-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast to this previous publication, we found that peptide-induced activation of GPR110 is transduced through both Gs and Gq proteins. To exclude indirect cAMP formation by Gαs-independent mechanisms, Gs protein-mediated cAMP formation in GPR110-transfected and peptide-stimulated cells was abolished after Gαs-specific siRNA-mediated knockdown (Fig. 1D). The EC50 value for pGPR110 in cAMP assays was 167.2 μm (Fig. 1E). Recently, Gs-protein coupling of GPR110 has been demonstrated by another group through the newly identified endogenous agonist called synaptamide (21Lee J.-W. Huang B.X. Kwon H. Rashid M.A. Kharebava G. Desai A. Patnaik S. Marugan J. Kim H.-Y. Orphan GPR110 (ADGRF1) targeted by N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine in development of neurons and cognitive function.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For GPR116, a 13-AA long peptide (pGPR116) displayed the highest efficiency in NFAT, whereas no activity was seen for any of the peptides in the cAMP assay (Fig. 2A). This indicates a more specific coupling of GPR116 to Gq/11 proteins. For more direct comparison of the downstream second messengers, concentration-response curves of pGPR110 and pGPR116 were performed in an IP1 accumulation assay using homogeneous time resolved fluorescence technology instead of the convenient but very indirect NFAT receptor assay. Here, EC50 values of 19.61 and 75.8 μm in GPR110- and GPR116-transfected cells were found, respectively (Fig. 2B). GPR115 activation was neither detectable in cAMP, NFAT, nor IP1 assay by any of the GPR115-derived peptides of the chosen library (Fig. 2C), even though its cell surface expression was comparable with GPR110 and GPR116 (Table 1). To check whether insufficient solubility of the peptides could be the cause of the observed differences in peptide efficacy or rather lack of function we performed dynamic light scattering measurements (see supplemental Fig. S1). We found that pGPR115 and pGPR116 were well dissolved, whereas pGPR110 showed more aggregates associated with a reduced solubility. Therefore, the observed differences in agonistic peptide function do not correlate with their solubility. Previous expression studies (15Prömel S. Waller-Evans H. Dixon J. Zahn D. Colledge W.H. Doran J. Carlton M.B. Grosse J. Schöneberg T. Russ A.P. Langenhan T. Characterization and functional study of a cluster of four highly conserved orphan adhesion-GPCR in mouse.Dev. Dyn. 2012; 241: 1591-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and qPCR analyses (Fig. 3A) revealed that Gpr110 is most prominently expressed in renal papillae, whereas GPR115 and GPR116 are more widely distributed, with GPR116 being present in nearly every tissue tested. Yet, signals mediated by GPR116 and GPR110 are distinguishable from each other as GPR116 activation mainly triggers a cascade via a Gq protein, whereas GPR110 additionally activates Gs. We chose lung tissue and cells isolated from renal papilla to study GPR116 and GPR110 activation, respectively. Seminal vesicle served as negative control tissue. We first investigated signaling of GPR110 upon stimulation with the agonistic peptide using the cAMP accumulation assay. The expected increase in cyclic AMP levels was measurable ex vivo in renal papilla (Fig. 3B) and upon forskolin application, which served as positive control in seminal vesicle (Fig. 3C). Treatment with pGPR110 (5 mm) led to a 2.2-fold increase of cAMP concentration in renal papillae ex vivo compared with tissue treated with same concentration of DMSO without the peptide (marked as “untreated”). Renal papillae isolated from Gpr110-deficient mice (15Prömel S. Waller-Evans H. Dixon J. Zahn D. Colledge W.H. Doran J. Carlton M.B. Grosse J. Schöneberg T. Russ A.P. Langenhan T. Characterization and functional study of a cluster of four highly conserved orphan adhesion-GPCR in mouse.Dev. Dyn. 2012; 241: 1591-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B) did not show any response upon stimulation with pGPR110, indicating that the cAMP signal detected in wild-type (wt) papillae is specific for GPR110 activation. To exclude any nonspecific effects of the peptide, a control peptide of 10 AA in length (npGPR110) with no activation capacity in in vitro assays (Fig. 1C) was applied. This peptide did not induce any significant changes in cAMP levels (Fig. 3B). Ex vivo activation of GPR116 in lung tissue did not show changes in cAMP concentration upon treatment with pGPR116 (Fig. 3B), whereas a 1.8-fold increase in IP1 concentration was detected compared with untreated control tissue (Fig. 3D). A negative control peptide of 20 AA length (npGPR116, Fig. 2A) did not induce any signal (Fig. 3D). We have recently postulated that the tethered peptide agonists of aGPCRs have a core region spanning the first 6–8 highly conserved AA, which is essential for agonistic activity (5Liebscher I. Schön J. Petersen S.C. Fischer L. Auerbach N. Demberg L.M. Mogha A. Cöster M. Simon K.U. Rothemund S. Monk K.R. Schöneberg T. A tethered agonist within the ectodomain activates the adhesion G protein-coupled receptors GPR126 and GPR133.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 2018-2026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As the core sequences of GPR110, GPR115, and GPR116 are almost identical (Fig. 1A) it is reasonable to assume that Stachel-derived peptides are promiscuous for members of subfamily VI. We therefore tested the active peptides of GPR110 and GPR116 and an analogous 13-AA peptide derived from GPR115 in cAMP and IP1 assays. In cAMP assays only activation of GPR110 through its own derived peptide was observed (Fig. 4A). However, IP1 assays showed promiscuous activation of both GPR110 and GPR116, through pGPR110 and pGPR116 (Fig. 4B) plus an activation of GPR110 through the respective peptide derived from the GPR115 Stachel region. Also, GPR115 raised IP1 levels upon stimulation with pGPR116 showing that the receptor itself is capable of signaling. These data confirm that subfamily VI-derived Stachel peptides are promiscuous between individual members (summarized in Fig. 4C). Ex vivo assays with lung tissue supported the in vitro results showing activation of GPR116 through pGPR110 in IP1 measurements (Fig. 4D). Verification of overlapping activation of peptides derived from GPR115 and GPR116 ex vivo in cAMP or IP1 assays is unfortunately hampered by the overlapping expression and preference in signal transduction of all three receptors (Fig. 3A). As GPR115 displayed signal transduction upon stimulation with pGPR116, and is therefore per se functional, we speculated that distinct differences in the GPR115-derived peptide sequence to pGPR116 are responsible for lack-of-function of pGPR115 at GPR115. Systematic site-directed mutagenesis of AA positions that differ between pGPR115 and pGPR116 revealed two mutations, S9P and K10D, enabling pGPR115 activity at GPR115 in NFAT and IP1 assay (Fig. 5, A and B), even though AA positions 9 and 10 are not part of the previously described core activating region of the Stachel sequence (16Wilde C. Fischer L. Lede V. Kirchberger J. Rothemund S. Schöneberg T. Liebscher I. The constitutive activity of the adhesion GPCR GPR114/ADGRG5 is mediated by its tethered agonist.FASEB J. 2016; 30: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that only the combination of the two mutants was capable of rescuing the agonistic property of pGPR115, yet the proline at position 9 (Fig. 1A) is the most prominent difference between GPR115 and the other members of this aGPCR subfamily. Comparing the cleavage motif and Stachel sequences of different orthologs of GPR116 and GPR115 may provide information whether the Stachel sequence of GPR115 has displayed an AA sequence that renders it inactive. As shown in Fig. 5C, GPR115 contains a proline at position 9 of the Stachel sequence in most mammalian orders at the beginning of its evolutionary appearance. This proline at position 9 is substituted by serine in rat, mouse, chimpanzee, and humans. Analysis of over 100 mammalian orthologs revealed that only proline and serine at position 9 are tolerated. Therefore, activity levels of the tethered agonist should not be hampered by either of the amino acids. This assumption is supported by the fact that the rescue of pGPR115 activity depended on the combination of S9P and K10D. The lysine in GPR115 is highly conserved among mammals and an asparagine is not found in any recent species sequenced yet at this position. It remains unknown whether the tethered agonist sequence has ever fit to the GPR115 binding pocket or whether the arrangement of serine and lysine within the peptide sequence leads to secondary effects of the peptide structure that impairs functional interaction with the receptor, whereas the Stachel sequence itself is active within the receptor structure. What we know is that GPR115 is a receptor capable of eliciting second messenger signals (Figs. 4B and 5, A and B) and pGPR115 is an active peptide at GPR110, where it causes changes in IP1 levels (Fig. 4B). Due to their common ancestry and AA sequence homology receptor cross-activation by Stachel-derived peptides of subfamily VI is reasonable. We next asked whether cross-activation can also occur between receptors within other subfamilies and across subfamilies. We have previously shown that peptides derived from GPR126 cannot activate GPR133 and vice versa (5Liebscher I. Schön J. Petersen S.C. Fischer L. Auerbach N. Demberg L.M. Mogha A. Cöster M. Simon K.U. Rothemund S. Monk K.R. Schöneberg T. A tethered agonist within the ectodomain activates the adhesion G protein-coupled receptors GPR126 and GPR133.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 2018-2026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Also, the peptide agonist of GPR64 cannot activate GPR110 and GPR133 (7Demberg L.M. Rothemund S. Schöneberg T. Liebscher I. Identification of the tethered peptide agonist of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor GPR64/ADGRG2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2015; 464: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, reflecting on the results from this study on subfamily VI, a cross-activation between GPR126 and GPR64 is likely, as they are closely related according to sequence homology (2Hamann J. Aust G. Araç D. Engel F.B. Formstone C. Fredriksson R. Hall R.A. Harty B.L. Kirchhoff C. Knapp B. Krishnan A. Liebscher I. Lin H.-H. Martinelli D.C. Monk K.R. et al.International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology: XCIV. adhesion G protein-coupled receptors.Pharmacol. Rev. 2015; 67: 338-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Indeed, peptides derived from GPR64 (pGPR64) and GPR126 (pGPR126) cross-activated the respective receptor in cAMP accumulation assays (Fig. 6A), again supporting their close evolutionary relationship as receptor subtypes. Concentration-response curves of the cross-activating peptides pGPR126 and pGPR64 at GPR126-transfected cells revealed that pGPR64 showed a shifted potency toward higher peptide concentrations compared with pGPR126 (Fig. 6B). As both peptides did not induce saturation in cAMP levels EC50 values cannot be determined. Cross-activation was also tested between subf"

Although the structures and catalytic mechanisms of alginate lyases in the other PL families have been clarified, those in family PL6 have yet to be revealed. Here, the crystal structure of AlyGC, a PL6 alginate lyase from marine bacterium Glaciecola chathamensis S18K6T, was solved, and its catalytic mechanism was illustrated. AlyGC is a homodimeric enzyme and adopts a structure distinct from other alginate lyases. Each monomer contains a catalytic N-terminal domain and a functionally unknown C-terminal domain. A combined structural and mutational analysis using the structures of AlyGC and of an inactive mutant R241A in complex with an alginate tetrasaccharide indicates that conformational changes occur in AlyGC when a substrate is bound and that the two active centers in AlyGC may not bind substrates simultaneously. The C-terminal domain is shown to be essential for the dimerization and the catalytic activity of AlyGC. Residues Tyr130, Arg187, His242, Arg265, and Tyr304 in the active center are also important for the activity of AlyGC. In catalysis, Lys220 and Arg241 function as the Bronsted base and acid, respectively, and a Ca2+ in the active center neutralizes the negative charge of the C5 carboxyl group of the substrate. Finally, based on our data, we propose a metal ion-assisted catalytic mechanism of AlyGC for alginate cleavage with a state change mode, which provides a better understanding for polysaccharide lyases and alginate degradation."

However, contextual fear conditioning is also linked to adult neurogenesis in the SGZ (28Pan Y.W. Storm D.R. Xia Z.

These findings suggest that CD44 and HA may influence hippocampus-dependent learning and memory through a mechanism involving the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we found that CD44-expressing NSCs are self-renewing and multipotent and that they synthesize HA that accumulates with aging. CD44-null NSCs demonstrate increased proliferation in vitro and in vivo, an effect mimicked by digestion of HA in the SGZ of wild type mice. In addition, CD44-null and hyaluronidase-treated wild type NSCs demonstrate delayed neuronal maturation. These data provide novel insights into how the HA-based extracellular matrix regulates adult neurogenesis and suggest that accumulation of HA could contribute to reduced neurogenesis and impaired memory with aging. To confirm that CD44 is expressed by mouse NSCs and to assess how CD44 expression changes with aging, we examined CD44 expression in the SGZs of 3-month-old and 9-month-old wild type mice. At both ages, cell bodies and processes of cells in the SGZ expressed CD44 (Fig. 1A, arrows, and data not shown). The specificity of the immunoreactivity was confirmed by lack of staining in tissues from CD44-null mice (Fig. 1A, inset). CD44 was expressed on processes of cells expressing SOX2 (a transcription factor expressed by NSCs) within the hilus and in the SGZ (Fig. 1, B and inset in B) as well as on Ki67+ (a marker of proliferating cells) and nestin+ (an intermediate filament protein expressed by NSCs) cells in the SGZ (Fig. 1, C and D). CD44 was not expressed by MAP2+ (a neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein) cells in the granule cell layer (Fig. 1E). To further characterize CD44 expression by adult NSCs and granule cell layer neurons, we grew SGZ-derived neurospheres and dissociated NSCs under conditions that favored neuronal differentiation (Neurobasal medium with B27, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and added glutamate) and immunolabeled the cells with an anti-CD44 antibody at different times in culture. Consistent with our in situ findings, CD44 was expressed by undifferentiated NSCs within neurospheres (Fig. 1F). Proliferating, acutely dissociated NSCs from these neurospheres co-expressed CD44 and SOX2 (Fig. 1G) as well as nestin (Fig. 1H). CD44 expression remained high when these cultures were switched to Neurobasal medium for 24 h (Fig. 1I). However, by 3 days in vitro, when cells demonstrated the morphology of more mature neurons and expressed MAP2, CD44 expression was diminished (Fig. 1J), and CD44 was completely absent in MAP2+ cells by 6 days in vitro (Fig. 1K). All together, these data indicate that NSCs in the SGZ express CD44 but that CD44 expression is diminished as NSCs differentiate into granule cell layer neurons. To assess the characteristics of CD44-expressing NSCs, we isolated CD44+ cells from dissociated primary SGZ neurosphere cultures by immunomagnetic cell sorting using CD44-biotin and anti-biotin microbeads. Cells were then double labeled using anti-SOX2 and anti-CD44 antibodies to confirm the efficiency of sorting. The majority of sorted cells demonstrated high CD44 immunolabeling with some cells showing less intense staining (Fig. 2A). From four separate sorts, 97.2 ± 0.9% of CD44+ cells expressed SOX2. Sorted cells were plated at clonal densities. Up to 60% of these cells formed secondary neurospheres (Fig. 2B). Plating at increasing cell densities resulted in significant increases in the numbers of neurospheres (Fig. 2C), whereas mean neurosphere densities did not significantly change with increasing plating density (Fig. 2D). These secondary neurospheres were transferred into culture media that promote their differentiation into neurons (as above), astrocytes (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with B27 and 1% fetal bovine serum), or oligodendrocytes (DMEM/F-12 with B27, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, triiodothyronine, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine as described previously (30Preston M. Gong X. Su W. Matsumoto S.G. Banine F. Winkler C. Foster S. Xing R. Struve J. Dean J. Baggenstoss B. Weigel P.H. Montine T.J. Back S.A. Sherman L.S. Digestion products of the PH20 hyaluronidase inhibit remyelination.Ann. Neurol. 2013; 73: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). After 3 days in these differentiation media, the CD44+ cells gave rise to cells in each lineage (Fig. 2, E–G). All together, these findings indicate that CD44+ cells isolated from SGZ-derived neurospheres are self-renewing and multipotent. Given the hippocampal memory deficits we observed in CD44-null mice (29Raber J. Olsen R.H. Su W. Foster S. Xing R. Acevedo S.F. Sherman L.S. CD44 is required for spatial memory retention and sensorimotor functions.Behav. Brain Res. 2014; 275: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the finding that SGZ-derived NSCs are CD44-expressing cells, we assessed the role of CD44 in SGZ neurogenesis. We plated wild type and CD44-null SGZ NSCs from 2-month-old mice at equivalent cell densities and examined their growth and survival. Cells from both genotypes formed neurospheres (Fig. 3, A and B) and were each capable of differentiating into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes although with different time courses (data not shown and see below). However, within 6 days, CD44-null neurospheres were 3–4 times larger than wild type neurospheres (Fig. 3B). The increased size of the CD44-null neurospheres was due to significant increases in cell proliferation (dividing 2–3 times faster than wild type cells) as assessed by cell counts (Fig. 3C). We did not observe any difference in the percentages of dead cells or cells expressing cleaved caspase-3 between wild type and CD44-null cultures (data not shown). To test whether CD44-null NSCs demonstrate increased rates of proliferation in situ, we compared 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and Ki67 expression in the SGZs of wild type and CD44-null mice. There was a significant 2-fold increase in BrdU incorporation by cells in the SGZ of 9-month-old (Fig. 3, D–F) CD44-null mice as compared with wild type animals. We also observed a slight but insignificant increase in proliferation in 3-month old animals (data not shown). These data indicate that CD44 signaling regulates NSC proliferation in the SGZ, especially in older animals. Interestingly, despite increased cell proliferation in the SGZs of CD44-null mice, the total volume of the DG was not significantly different in CD44-null animals (611,316 ± 105,778 μm3) compared with wild type mice (655,415 ± 146,968 μm3; p > 0.3). Changes in cell cycle rates can influence NSC differentiation (32Salomoni P. Calegari F. Cell cycle control of mammalian neural stem cells: putting a speed limit on G1.Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 233-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether neuronal differentiation is altered in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus in CD44-null mice. In both 3- and 9-month-old CD44-null mice, we found no significant differences in the numbers of cells expressing the mature neuron marker NeuN (expressed predominantly in granule cell nuclei) as compared with wild type mice (Fig. 4, A, D, and G, and data not shown). However, there was a >2-fold increase in the numbers of cells expressing doublecortin (DCX), a marker of immature neurons (expressed predominantly in the processes of cells adjacent to the SGZ), in the inner granule cell layer of CD44-null as compared with wild type mice at 9 months of age (Fig. 4, B, C, E, F, and H). There was a slight increase in DCX+ cells at 3 months (data not shown). The increase in DCX+ cells in CD44-null mice led to a significant decrease in the ratio of NeuN+:DCX+ cells (Fig. 4I). To test whether CD44 influences NSC differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner, we compared neuronal differentiation in cultures of SGZ NSCs from 2-month-old wild type and CD44-null mice. Cells were plated at identical cell densities, grown under conditions that favor neuronal differentiation as above, and then assayed for DCX and NeuN expression. Although most wild type cells became NeuN+ within 7 days, CD44-null NSCs remained DCX+ for greater than 10 days (Fig. 4, J–M). Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the hippocampal memory deficits that we observed in CD44-null mice (29Raber J. Olsen R.H. Su W. Foster S. Xing R. Acevedo S.F. Sherman L.S. CD44 is required for spatial memory retention and sensorimotor functions.Behav. Brain Res. 2014; 275: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) are linked to delayed granule cell maturation. Following spatial learning, the transcription factor c-Fos is induced in granule cells that are recruited into spatial memory circuits (33Guzowski J.F. Timlin J.A. Roysam B. McNaughton B.L. Worley P.F. Barnes C.A. Mapping behaviorally relevant neural circuits with immediate-early gene expression.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 34Kee N. Teixeira C.M. Wang A.H. Frankland P.W. Preferential incorporation of adult-generated granule cells into spatial memory networks in the dentate gyrus.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). We therefore examined c-Fos expression in the dentate gyri of 6-month-old female wild type and CD44-null mice following behavioral training as described previously (29Raber J. Olsen R.H. Su W. Foster S. Xing R. Acevedo S.F. Sherman L.S. CD44 is required for spatial memory retention and sensorimotor functions.Behav. Brain Res. 2014; 275: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Compared with wild type mice, CD44-null animals displayed a significant reduction in induced c-Fos expression throughout the granule cell layer (Fig. 4, N–P). These data indicate that CD44 is required to regulate the expansion of NSCs and their differentiation into functional dentate granule layer neurons. HA, the major CD44 ligand, can be localized in cells and tissues using labeled HA-binding proteins. Using this approach, a previous study demonstrated strong extracellular HA staining in the adult rat SGZ (22Fuxe K. Tinner B. Chadi G. Härfstrand A. Agnati L.F. Evidence for a regional distribution of hyaluronic acid in the rat brain using a highly specific hyaluronic acid recognizing protein.Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 169: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether HA is similarly localized in the adult mouse SGZ using a biotinylated HA-binding protein (HABP) as described previously by us (19Struve J. Maher P.C. Li Y.Q. Kinney S. Fehlings M.G. Kuntz 4th, C. Sherman L.S. Disruption of the hyaluronan-based extracellular matrix in spinal cord promotes astrocyte proliferation.Glia. 2005; 52: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Back S.A. Tuohy T.M. Chen H. Wallingford N. Craig A. Struve J. Luo N.L. Banine F. Liu Y. Chang A. Trapp B.D. Bebo Jr., B.F. Rao M.S. Sherman L.S. Hyaluronan accumulates in demyelinated lesions and inhibits oligodendrocyte progenitor maturation.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). We found that HA is enriched in the SGZ in 3-month-old mice but is also found diffusely throughout the hilus and granule cell layer (Fig. 5A). We previously found that HA increases with age in prefrontal cortex (14Cargill R. Kohama S.G. Struve J. Su W. Banine F. Witkowski E. Back S.A. Sherman L.S. Astrocytes in aged nonhuman primate brain gray matter synthesize excess hyaluronan.Neurobiol. Aging. 2012; 33: 830.e13-830.e24Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Given that the effects of CD44 on neurogenesis are most pronounced in older animals, we tested whether the levels of HA increase in the SGZ with age. HABP staining revealed that HA levels are higher throughout the dentate gyrus in 9-month-old mice as compared with 3-month old mice (Fig. 5B). This pattern of expression is not disrupted in CD44-null mice (Fig. 5B, inset). We quantified differences in levels of HA in the dentate gyrus by dissecting and pooling dentate gyrus tissue, isolating HA, and quantifying total HA concentrations using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assay. We found that by 12 months, there was nearly double the amount of HA in the dentate gyrus compared with 2.5-month-old animals (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, we found that both wild type and CD44-null SGZ-derived NSCs synthesize HA in vitro (Fig. 5, D–H) and express all three HA synthases (Fig. 5I). Collectively, these data indicate that HA is present in the SGZ, is synthesized by NSCs, and accumulates with increasing age. Given that elevated levels of HA are found in the SGZ of older adults and our finding that CD44, a major transmembrane HA receptor, regulates NSC proliferation in the SGZ, we tested whether adding HA to acutely dissociated NSC cultures influences NSC proliferation. Primary NSCs were isolated from wild type and CD44-null mice as described above and treated with a 100 μg of HA as described previously (20Back S.A. Tuohy T.M. Chen H. Wallingford N. Craig A. Struve J. Luo N.L. Banine F. Liu Y. Chang A. Trapp B.D. Bebo Jr., B.F. Rao M.S. Sherman L.S. Hyaluronan accumulates in demyelinated lesions and inhibits oligodendrocyte progenitor maturation.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) for 48 h before the cells had synthesized substantial amounts of endogenous HA. Cells were pulsed with BrdU for the final 3 h in vitro, immunolabeled with antibodies against SOX2 and BrdU, and then stained with Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 6, A–D). Although wild type NSCs treated with HA incorporated significantly less BrdU than vehicle (PBS)-treated wild type cells (Fig. 6, A, C, and E), there was no significant difference in BrdU incorporation between CD44-null cells treated with vehicle and CD44-null cells treated with HA (Fig. 6, B, D, and E). Interestingly, HA had no effect on the proportion of DCX+ and NeuN+ cells in either wild type (Fig. 6F) or CD44-null (Fig. 6G) cultures. These data confirm that elevated HA can inhibit NSC proliferation in a CD44-dependent manner but does not, by itself, influence neuronal differentiation. We tested whether disruption of HA in wild type NSC cultures mimics the phenotypes of CD44-null NSCs. SGZ-derived NSCs were grown in the presence of 20 units/ml recombinant PH20 (rPH20), a hyaluronidase that functions at neutral pH, or a preparation of bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH), the soluble activity of which is PH20. Fresh rPH20 or BTH was added to wild type cultures every 24 h. After 3 days, cells were treated with BrdU and then assayed for changes in cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 7, A–C, the number of BrdU+/nestin+ cells significantly increased following rPH20 treatment. Similar results were obtained using BTH (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the effects of hyaluronidase were due to activities other than HA digestion, we also tested the effects of a chondroitinase (chondroitinase ABC) on NSC proliferation using concentration ranges previously shown to digest chondroitin sulfate in cultures of NSCs (0.05–0.1 unit/ml; Ref. 35Sirko S. von Holst A. Wizenmann A. Götz M. Faissner A. Chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans control proliferation, radial glia cell differentiation and neurogenesis in neural stem/progenitor cells.Development. 2007; 134: 2727-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Unlike rPH20 and BTH, chondroitinase did not influence NSC proliferation (Fig. 7C and data not shown). To test whether the effects of hyaluronidase treatment on NSC proliferation are dependent on CD44, we repeated the experiment shown in Fig. 7, A–C, using both wild type and CD44-null NSCs. In contrast to wild type NSCs, CD44-null NSC proliferation was not significantly altered in the presence of rPH20 (Fig. 7, D–F). To test whether disruption of HA in the SGZ also induces increased NSC proliferation, we performed stereotactic injections of rPH20 (20 units in 1 μl) into the SGZ of adult mice (Fig. 7, G–I), pulsed animals with BrdU at 1 and 24 h postinjection, and then harvested their brains 24 h later. Control animals received injections of vehicle alone. Compared with vehicle controls (Fig. 7G, inset), HA was almost completely digested from animals that received rPH20 (Fig. 7H, inset) 24 h following injection. Some HA was returning in rPH20 sections 2 days after injection (e.g. Fig. 7, compare H with inset in H). Compared with controls, animals injected with rPH20 demonstrated significantly increased numbers of BrdU-labeled cells in the SGZ (Fig. 7, G–I). We next tested whether disruption of HA influences neuronal differentiation by SGZ-derived NSCs. Similar to our findings i"

Recent studies demonstrated that the abnormal activation of TLR4 has a pivotal role in obesity-induced inflammation, which is associated with several diseases, including hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and cardiovascular disease. Here we demonstrate that (−)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate, a natural agonist of the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR), suppressed TLR4 expression through E3 ubiquitin-protein ring finger protein 216 (RNF216) up-regulation.

Cyclic GMP (cGMP) is a well known secondary messenger that plays a central role in vascular homeostasis and penile erection. The regulation of cGMP is a well established strategy for cardioprotection, vasodilatation, and increased blood flow. However, little is known about the role of cGMP in the regulation of inflammation. Here we show that a natural 67LR agonist, (−)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), significantly suppressed TLR4 expression in macrophages through cGMP production. However, EGCG treatment did not affect TLR4 expression at the mRNA level, whereas EGCG induced the ubiquitination of TLR4. In this pathway, cGMP induction up-regulated E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ring finger protein 216 (RNF216). Moreover, the highly absorbent 67LR agonist (−)-epigallocatechin-3-O-(3-O-methyl)-gallate (EGCG3″Me), the characteristic compound in green tea (11.Suzuki T. Kumazoe M. Kim Y. Yamashita S. Nakahara K.

Green tea extract containing a highly absorbent catechin prevents diet-induced lipid metabolism disorder.Sci. Rep. 2013; 3: 2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), significantly attenuated TLR4 expression in adipose tissue and was accompanied with the up-regulation of RNF216. This agonist significantly suppressed the HF/HS diet-induced increase in the production of inflammatory cytokines and HF/HS diet-induced dyslipidemia, including the increase in serum TG levels and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio. Taken together, 67LR and cGMP induction presents a possible novel target for the relief of obesity-induced inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that TLR4 acts as a trigger of obesity-induced inflammation. Furthermore, TLR4 deficiency is reported to prevent lipid-induced NFκB DNA binding to the IL-6 and MCP-1 promoters. Consistent with NFκB activation, lipid infusion stimulated TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 mRNA expression in adipose tissue of wild-type mice, but not in TLR4−/− mice (9.Kim F. Pham M. Luttrell I.

Several studies have shown that the natural 67LR agonist EGCG has an inhibitory effect on TLR4-dependent inflammation (14.Li W. Ashok M. Li J. Yang H. Sama A.E. Wang H. A major ingredient of green tea rescues mice from lethal sepsis partly by inhibiting HMGB1.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15.Byun E.B. Choi H.G. Sung N.Y.

Commun. 2012; 426: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine the effect of EGCG on TLR4 expression in macrophages, peritoneal macrophages were treated with the indicated concentrations of EGCG. As shown in Fig. 1A, EGCG suppressed TLR4 expression in a dose-dependent manner. The same result was obtained from the flow cytometry analysis of EGCG-treated peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1B). To determine the effect of EGCG on TLR4 expression in a mouse model, mice received intraperitoneal injections of EGCG (10 mg/kg/day) for 3 days, which resulted in a significantly reduced TLR4 expression in splenocytes derived from EGCG-treated mice, as compared with that of vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 1C). To determine the effect of EGCG on the sensitivity of macrophages to the TLR4 ligand, macrophages obtained from EGCG-injected mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As shown in Fig. 1D, macrophages derived from EGCG-treated mice showed a limited response to the TLR4 ligand. Our data also showed EGCG pretreatment directly suppressed LPS susceptibility in isolated macrophages Fig. 1E. Taken together, EGCG suppressed both TLR4 expression and LPS sensitivity in isolated macrophages. Because EGCG suppressed TLR4 expression without affecting TLR4 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A), we hypothesized that EGCG enhanced the degradation of TLR4. Ubiquitination is a crucial step in protein degradation brought about by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. To test this hypothesis, macrophages from EGCG-treated mice were immunoprecipitated with anti-TLR4 antibody and evaluated by immunoblot analysis using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, the 67LR agonist induced TLR4 ubiquitination. RNF216, also known as Triad3A, is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ring finger protein that regulates TLR4 degradation (16.Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Triad3A, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase regulating Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, EGCG treatment up-regulated RNF216 expression in a time-dependent manner. Our data showed that EGCG increased RNF216 at the protein level consistent with the effect of EGCG on RNF216 at the mRNA level (Fig. 2D). To determine whether RNF216 is involved in EGCG-induced TLR4 down-regulation, we evaluated the effect of RNF216-knockdown on the EGCG-elicited decrease in TLR4 expression. As shown in Fig. 2, E and F, RNF216 knockdown significantly attenuated the reducing effect of EGCG on TLR4 expression. Next, to determine whether EGCG increases RNF216 expression in vivo, mice received intraperitoneal injections of EGCG, which resulted in the up-regulation of RNF216 expression in splenocytes (Fig. 2G). The same result was obtained from macrophages derived from EGCG-treated mice (Fig. 2H). Taken together, these results indicate that EGCG decreased TLR4 expression through RNF216 up-regulation. cGMP is a secondary messenger involved in the regulation of vascular homeostasis and its induction is a well established strategy for the treatment of vasodilatation by increasing blood flow (17.Keravis T. Lugnier C.

J. Pharmacol. 2012; 165: 1288-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Because 67LR, the target molecule of EGCG (18.Tachibana H. Koga K. Fujimura Y. Yamada K.

Ueda N. Yamashita S. Kim Y. Yamada K. Tachibana H. 67-kDa laminin receptor increases cGMP to induce cancer-selective apoptosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 787-799PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Kumazoe M.

As shown in Fig. 3A, EGCG up-regulated intracellular cGMP levels in a dose-dependent manner. Guanylyl cyclases belong to a family of enzymes that catalyze cGMP synthesis from GTP. To determine the role of cGMP in the EGCG-induced down-regulation of TLR4, the effect of a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor on EGCG-elicited down-regulation of TLR4 was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 3B, the sGC inhibitor NS-2028 significantly attenuated EGCG-induced TLR4 down-regulation. To confirm the involvement of cGMP in EGCG-elicited TLR4 down-regulation, we examined the influence of the NO-independent sGC activator BAY 41-2272 on TLR4 expression in macrophages. The data presented in Fig. 3C suggest that cGMP induction is sufficient to reduce TLR4 expression levels in macrophages. To evaluate whether cGMP up-regulates RNF216 expression, the effects of the cGMP inducer on RNF216 expression were assessed. As shown in Fig. 3D, the cGMP inducer BAY 41-2272 increased RNF216 expression in a time-dependent manner. We also confirmed that BAY 41-2272 treatment significantly increased RNF216 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3E). Our data demonstrated that the cGMP inducer BAY 41-2272 up-regulated RNF216 at the protein level consistent with the effect of BAY 41-2272 on RNF216 at the mRNA level (Fig. 3F). Our results also suggested that sGC (NO-dependent cGMP synthase) inhibitor pretreatment completely canceled EGCG-induced RNF216 up-regulation at the protein level, indicating that EGCG increases RNF216 in a sGC-dependent manner (Fig. 3G). Importantly, the cGMP inducer-elicited TLR4 down-regulation was completely canceled by RNF216 knockdown (Fig. 3, H and I). Taken together, these findings indicate that the well known secondary messenger cGMP, which is involved in vascular homeostasis, plays a crucial role in EGCG-induced TLR4 down-regulation through RNF216 up-regulation. Macrophages are mostly responsible for local inflammation through TNFα production in adipose tissue. Also, macrophage-derived TNFα is known to induce hyperinsulinemia and induction of macrophage infiltration followed by MCP-1 expression, which is involved in a feedback loop resulting in additional TNFα production (8.Kanda H. Tateya S. Tamori Y. Kotani K. Hiasa K. Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S. Miyachi H. Maeda S. Egashira K. Kasuga M. MCP-1 contributes to macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis in obesity.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). TNFα also causes hyperinsulinemia (22.Medina E.A. Erickson K.L. Stanhope K.L. Havel P.J. Evidence that tumor necrosis factor-α-induced hyperinsulinemia prevents decreases of circulating leptin during fasting in rats.Metabolism. 2002; 51: 1104-1110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A recent clinical study demonstrated a significant correlation between serum TNFα levels and states of hyperinsulinemia (23.Lai H.L. Kartal J. Mitsnefes M. Hyperinsulinemia in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease: the role of tumor necrosis factor-α.Pediatr. Nephrol. 2007; 22: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To confirm 67LR involvement in a high absorbent EGCG analogue, EGCG3″Me-induced TNFα suppression, we transfected mouse primary macrophages with a lentivirus encoding scrambled control shRNA or shRNA against 67LR. Previous study showed that saturated fatty acids including palmitate (C16:0) triggered inflammatory signaling through TLR4 and suggested plays the crucial role in obesity-related chronic inflammation (13.Könner A.C. Brüning J.C. Toll-like receptors: linking inflammation to metabolism.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 22: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the silencing of 67LR abrogated the inhibitory effect of the 67LR agonist EGCG3″Me on palmitate-induced TNFα expression (Fig. 4, A and B). To determine the effect of this highly absorbent 67LR agonist on HF/HS diet-induced inflammation, 12-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed the HF/HS diet supplemented with EGCG3″Me (0.9 mg/mouse) for 8 weeks. As shown in Fig. 4C, the EGCG3″Me diet significantly suppressed TLR4 expression in the adipose tissue. Our data also showed that EGCG3″Me intake up-regulated RNF216 expression in adipose tissue (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, our data also suggested that LPS treatment significantly suppressed RNF216 expression at the protein level in macrophages (Fig. 4E). Food intake was slightly increased in EGCG3″Me-containing diet groups compared with that in the HF/HS diet group (data not shown). HF/HS diet intake significantly up-regulated TNFα expression in adipose tissue. In contrast, the 67LR agonist completely canceled HF/HS diet-induced TNFα expression (Fig. 4F). We also found that MCP-1 expression in adipose tissue was up-regulated in the HF/HS group compared with that in the control group (Fig. 4G). However, EGCG3″Me suppressed the increase in HF/HS diet-induced MCP-1 expression (Fig. 4G). Our results also suggested that EGCG3″Me treatment strongly suppressed the IL-6 level, which is a major player in inflammation in adipose tissue (Fig. 4H). On the other hand, EGCG3″Me did not suppress but rather increased leptin, which is another regulator involved in obesity-induced inflammation in adipose tissue (Fig. 4I). EGCG3″Me treatment strongly suppressed serum MCP-1 levels (Fig. 4J). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the highly absorbent 67LR agonist strongly attenuated HF/HS diet-induced inflammation in vivo. Adipose tissue inflammation is associated with hyperinsulinemia. TNFα is the main inflammatory cytokine implicated in hyperinsulinemia. Clinical studies suggest a significant correlation between serum TNFα levels and states of hyperinsulinemia (23.Lai H.L. Kartal J. Mitsnefes M. Hyperinsulinemia in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease: the role of tumor necrosis factor-α.Pediatr. Nephrol. 2007; 22: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24.Bastard J.P. Maachi M. Lagathu C. Kim M.J. Caron M. Vidal H. Capeau J. Feve B. Recent advances in the relationship between obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance.Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2006; 17: 4-12PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that EGCG3″Me suppresses lipogenesis by improving HF/HS-induced hyperinsulinemia. To examine the potential anti-hyperinsulinemia effects of EGCG3″Me, fasting serum insulin levels were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 5A, EGCG3″Me attenuated the HF/HS diet-induced increase in serum insulin. The down-regulation of hepatic insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2) expression is observed in chronic hyperinsulinemia (25.Zhang J. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Insulin inhibits transcription of IRS-2 gene in rat liver through an insulin response element (IRE) that resembles IREs of other insulin-repressed genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3756-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Likewise, in this study, HF/HS diet intake reduced IRS-2 expression. However, there was no difference in IRS-2 expression levels between mice fed the HF/HS diet containing EGCG3″Me and those fed the control diet (Fig. 5B). Adipose tissue inflammation is associated with obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia. As shown in Fig. 5C, TNFα expression significantly correlated with fasting insulin levels (Rs = 0.719, p < 0.05, Spearman rank test, n = 18). Hyperinsulinemia is reported to induce dyslipidemia through the up-regulation of fatty acid synthesis (26.Boden G. Salehi S. Cheung P. Homko C. Song W. Loveland-Jones C. Jayarajan S. Comparison of in vivo effects of insulin on SREBP-1c activation and INSIG-1/2 in rat liver and human and rat adipose tissue.Obesity. 2013; 21: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that EGCG3″Me suppresses lipogenesis by improving HF/HS-induced hyperinsulinemia. Epidemiological and clinical studies have found the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio to be an excellent predictor of cardiovascular disease (27.Fernandez M.L. Webb D. The LDL to HDL cholesterol ratio as a valuable tool to evaluate coronary heart disease risk.J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2008; 27: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The HF/HS diet significantly increased the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Conversely, the highly absorbent 67LR agonist suppressed the HF/HS-induced increase in the serum LDL-C/HDL-C ratio (Fig. 5D). EGCG3″Me also abrogated the HF/HS-induced increase in serum TG levels (Fig. 5E). The liver plays a central role in fatty acid metabolism, including oxidation, synthesis, and storage. As shown in Fig. 5F, EGCG3″Me canceled the HF/HS diet-induced TG accumulation in the liver. Therefore, these results suggest a correlation between fasting insulin levels and the LDL/HDL ratio (Rs = 0.713, p < 0.05, Spearman rank test, n = 18; Fig. 5G). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between fasting insulin and liver TG levels (Fig. 5H). Taken together, EGCG3″Me intake ameliorated HF/HS diet-induced dyslipidemia accompanied with hyperinsulinemia. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) activates the transcription of genes encoding enzymes active in fatty acid biosynthesis in the liver and is involved in the development of fatty livers (28.Shimano H. SREBPs: physiology and pathophysiology of the SREBP family.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Hyperinsulinemia triggers dyslipidemia through SREBP-1 (26.Boden G. Salehi S. Cheung P. Homko C. Song W. Loveland-Jones C. Jayarajan S. Comparison of in vivo effects of insulin on SREBP-1c activation and INSIG-1/2 in rat liver and human and rat adipose tissue.Obesity. 2013; 21: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5I, there was a 3.3-fold increase in SREBP-1 expression in the HF/HS diet group compared with that in the control diet group. However, the HF/HS diet containing EGCG3″Me produced no significant increase in SREBP-1 expression compared with the control diet. SREBP-1 is involved in the expression regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1). Expression levels of SREBP-1-regulated downstream genes were increased in mice fed the HF/HS diet compared with those fed the control diet. However, there was no significant increase in the expression levels of these genes in mice fed the HF/HS diet containing EGCG3″Me compared with those fed the control diet (Fig. 5, J–L). The HF/HS diet was also associated with up-regulation of genes coding for cholesterol synthesis enzymes, including 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS). However, EGCG3″Me intake significantly diminished HMGCR (Fig. 5M) and HMGCS (Fig. 5N) expressions. Importantly, EGCG3″Me did not increase plasma levels of AST or ALT (data not shown). Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) is a recently identified member of the mitochondrial transporter superfamily that uncouples proton entry in the mitochondrial matrix from ATP synthesis and has been associated with the decreased risk of obesity (29.Esterbauer H.

https://openalex.org/W2584838045,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is polyresistant to chemo- and radiotherapy and biologicals, including TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of RCC, has been shown to sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, in particular by down-regulation of the Bak-inhibitory Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1. Here we demonstrate that sorafenib overcomes TRAIL resistance in RCC by a mechanism that does not rely on Mcl-1 down-regulation. Instead, sorafenib induces rapid dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) that is accompanied by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Loss of ΔΨm and ROS production induced by sorafenib are independent of caspase activities and do not depend on the presence of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bax or Bak, indicating that both events are functionally upstream of the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling cascade. More intriguingly, we find that it is sorafenib-induced ROS accumulation that enables TRAIL to activate caspase-8 in RCC. This leads to apoptosis that involves activation of an amplification loop via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Thus, our mechanistic data indicate that sorafenib bypasses central resistance mechanisms through a direct induction of ΔΨm breakdown and ROS production. Activation of this pathway might represent a useful strategy to overcome the cell-inherent resistance to cancer therapeutics, including TRAIL, in multiresistant cancers such as RCC."

https://openalex.org/W2581776985,"A hallmark of cancer cells is the ability to survive and proliferate when challenged with stressors such as growth factor insufficiency. In this study, we report a novel glycosylation-dependent mechanism that protects tumor cells from serum growth factor withdrawal. Our results suggest that the β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6Gal-I) sialyltransferase, which is up-regulated in numerous cancers, promotes the survival of serum-starved cells. Using ovarian and pancreatic cancer cell models with ST6Gal-I overexpression or knockdown, we find that serum-starved cells with high ST6Gal-I levels exhibit increased activation of prosurvival signaling molecules, including pAkt, p-p70S6K, and pNFκB. Correspondingly, ST6Gal-I activity augments the expression of tumor-promoting pNFκB transcriptional targets such as IL-6, IL-8, and the apoptosis inhibitor cIAP2. ST6Gal-I also potentiates expression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D2, leading to increased phosphorylation and inactivation of the cell cycle inhibitor pRb. Consistent with these results, serum-starved cells with high ST6Gal-I expression maintain a greater number of S phase cells compared with low ST6Gal-I expressors, reflecting enhanced proliferation. Finally, selective enrichment in clonal variants with high ST6Gal-I expression is observed upon prolonged serum deprivation, supporting the concept that ST6Gal-I confers a survival advantage. Collectively, these results implicate a functional role for ST6Gal-I in fostering tumor cell survival within the serum-depleted tumor microenvironment.

Cell surface glycans lie at the interface between the extracellular milieu and intracellular signaling networks that regulate cellular response to the microenvironment. Glycosylation of surface receptors can have profound effects on cell signaling through glycan-dependent modulation of receptor conformation, clustering, surface retention, and/or interaction with other membrane proteins. The profile of glycans on membrane receptors changes dramatically in correspondence with numerous pathophysiologic conditions, including malignant transformation (1Munkley J. Elliott D.J.

Consistent with a potential function in conferring stem cell-like properties, we recently reported that ST6Gal-I promotes a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype (16Schultz M.J. Holdbrooks A.T. Chakraborty A. Grizzle W.E. Landen C.N. Buchsbaum D.J. Conner M.G. Arend R.C. Yoon K.J. Klug C.A. Bullard D.C. Kesterson R.A. Oliver P.G. O'Connor A.K. Yoder B.K. Bellis S.L.

ST6Gal-I expression correlates with other CSC markers, including ALDH1 and CD133 (15Swindall A.F. Londoño-Joshi A.I. Schultz M.J. Fineberg N. Buchsbaum D.J. Bellis S.L. ST6Gal-I protein expression is upregulated in human epithelial tumors and correlates with stem cell markers in normal tissues and colon cancer cell lines.Cancer Res. 2013; 73: 2368-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and ST6Gal-I activity is critical for CSC behaviors such as tumor spheroid growth, chemoresistance and tumor-initiating potential (16Schultz M.J. Holdbrooks A.T. Chakraborty A. Grizzle W.E. Landen C.N. Buchsbaum D.J. Conner M.G. Arend R.C. Yoon K.J. Klug C.A. Bullard D.C. Kesterson R.A. Oliver P.G. O'Connor A.K. Yoder B.K. Bellis S.L. The tumor-associated glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I regulates stem cell transcription factors and confers a cancer stem cell phenotype.Cancer Res. 2016; 76: 3978-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Additionally, ST6Gal-I up-regulation in tumor cells induces the expression of important CSC-associated transcription factors, including Sox9 and Slug (16Schultz M.J. Holdbrooks A.T. Chakraborty A. Grizzle W.E. Landen C.N. Buchsbaum D.J. Conner M.G. Arend R.C. Yoon K.J. Klug C.A. Bullard D.C. Kesterson R.A. Oliver P.G. O'Connor A.K. Yoder B.K. Bellis S.L. The tumor-associated glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I regulates stem cell transcription factors and confers a cancer stem cell phenotype.Cancer Res. 2016; 76: 3978-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that one of the main functions of ST6Gal-I in cancer cells, including CSCs, is to protect against diverse cytotoxic stimuli through sialylation-dependent modulation of cell surface receptors. For example, α2-6 sialylation of the Fas receptor inhibits apoptosis by preventing Fas internalization, a requisite step in apoptotic signaling (12Swindall A.F. Bellis S.L. Sialylation of the Fas death receptor by ST6Gal-I provides protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis in colon carcinoma cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 22982-22990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α2-6 sialylation of TNFR1 blocks TNFα-stimulated cell death (13Liu Z. Swindall A.F.

Chammas R. Bellis S.L. Sialylation of β1 integrins blocks cell adhesion to galectin-3 and protects cells against galectin-3-induced apoptosis.J. Biol.

In immune cells, ST6Gal-I-mediated sialylation of CD45 prevents galectin-dependent CD45 clustering and subsequent apoptosis (23Amano M. Galvan M. He J. Baum L.G.

Finally, α2-6 sialylation of the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule receptor prevents endothelial cell death (24Kitazume S. Imamaki R. Ogawa K. Komi Y. Futakawa S. Kojima S. Hashimoto Y.

In this study, we describe a new survival-associated function for ST6Gal-I: protection against serum growth factor insufficiency. Using ovarian and pancreatic cancer cell models with ST6Gal-I overexpression or knockdown, we show that ST6Gal-I facilitates the survival of cells grown under serum-depleted culture conditions. Serum-starved cells with high ST6Gal-I expression maintain activation of prosurvival signaling nodes, including Akt and NFκB, and retain proliferative capacity via ST6Gal-I-dependent up-regulation of cyclin D2. These findings highlight a novel role for the tumor glycome in sustaining the viability of tumor cells exposed to serum-depleted environments, such as those found within hypovascularized regions of large, solid tumors. To interrogate the role of ST6Gal-I in protection against serum withdrawal, ST6Gal-I was stably overexpressed in the OV4 ovarian cancer cell line, which is one of the few cancer lines that lack detectable ST6Gal-I protein (Fig. 1A). As expected, overexpression (OE) of ST6Gal-I led to a pronounced increase in surface α2-6 sialylation relative to empty vector (EV) control cells, as measured by the binding of SNA (Fig. 1B). The SNA lectin specifically detects α2-6 sialic acids. Contrarily, ST6Gal-I overexpression had no effect on α2-3 sialylation, evidenced by equivalent binding of the MAA lectin to EV and OE cells (Fig. 1C). OV4 EV or OE cells were grown in medium containing 10%, 1%, or 0% FBS for 1 week. As shown in Fig. 1D, EV cells grown in 1% FBS displayed a spindle-shaped morphology, reflecting cell stress, whereas EV cells grown in 0% FBS exhibited rounding and detachment from the plate, indicative of cell death. In contrast to EV cells, OE cells maintained a spread morphology and formed a confluent monolayer, even in 0% FBS, suggesting that ST6Gal-I promotes cell survival. In complementary studies, the effect of ST6Gal-I knockdown was examined. BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells, which have moderate levels of endogenous ST6Gal-I, were stably transduced with a lentivirus encoding shRNA for ST6Gal-I (Fig. 1E). ST6Gal-I knockdown (KD) cells had reduced surface expression of α2-6 sialic acids (indicated by decreased SNA staining, Fig. 1F), whereas α2–3 sialylation was unaffected (Fig. 1G). BxPC3 EV and KD cells were grown for 1 week in 10% or 1% FBS. EV cell morphology was indistinguishable in the 10% versus 1% FBS cultures; however, serum-starved KD cells showed evidence of cytotoxicity and cell detachment (Fig. 1H). We also assessed BXPC3 growth in 0% FBS; however, there were few surviving cells in the KD population (data not shown). Therefore, all subsequent studies were conducted with 1% FBS for the BxPC3 line. To further probe the role of ST6Gal-I in protection against serum withdrawal, OV4 and BxPC3 cells were grown for 1 week in 10% or 1% FBS, lysed, and immunoblotted for survival-associated signaling molecules. Under conditions of serum-depletion, OV4 OE cells expressed higher levels of activated (phosphorylated) Akt as well as the apoptosis inhibitor cIAP2 relative to EV cells (representative blots in Fig. 2A and densitometric analyses of three independent blots in Fig. 2B). Interestingly, pAkt and cIAP2 expression was also higher in the OE versus EV cultures grown in 10% FBS, suggesting that ST6Gal-I enhances basal activation of these molecules. Consistent with these results, serum-starved BxPC3 cells with ST6Gal-I knockdown had reduced levels of pAkt and cIAP2 compared with EV cells (representative blots in Fig 2C and densitometry in Fig. 2D). We also immunoblotted for apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which is a caspase-independent cell death marker associated with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. OV4 OE cells had lower expression of AIF than EV cells under conditions of both 10% and 1% FBS. However, unlike OV4 cells, AIF expression in BxPC3 cells was equivalent in the serum-starved EV and KD lines. Additionally, we evaluated Beclin expression, a marker for autophagy. No significant correlations were noted between Beclin levels and ST6Gal-I activity in the two cell models, suggesting that autophagy may not be a major factor in the protective effect of ST6Gal-I, although further studies are clearly needed. Other studies from our group have suggested that cytotoxic stimuli can exert selective pressure, leading to the expansion of clonal variants with high ST6Gal-I expression. For example, cell lines developed to grow continuously in the presence of the chemotherapeutics cisplatin or irinotecan have up-regulated ST6Gal-I (15Swindall A.F. Londoño-Joshi A.I. Schultz M.J. Fineberg N. Buchsbaum D.J. Bellis S.L. ST6Gal-I protein expression is upregulated in human epithelial tumors and correlates with stem cell markers in normal tissues and colon cancer cell lines.Cancer Res. 2013; 73: 2368-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 25Schultz M.J. Swindall A.F. Wright J.W. Sztul E.S. Landen C.N. Bellis S.L. ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase confers cisplatin resistance in ovarian tumor cells.J. Ovarian Res. 2013; 6: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated whether prolonged exposure to serum-depleted culture conditions would select for cells with high ST6Gal-I expression. OV4 EV and OE cells were grown in 10% or 1% FBS for 1 week, and then cells were lysed and immunoblotted for ST6Gal-I (Fig. 3, A and B). Although the levels of ST6Gal-I remained undetectable in EV cells, OE cells showed a distinct enrichment in ST6Gal-I expression in 1% compared with 10% FBS culture conditions. The ST6Gal-I OE line is a polyclonal population generated by lentiviral transduction, and the ST6Gal-I construct is driven by a constitutive promoter. Thus, increased ST6Gal-I levels in the 1% FBS OE cultures are more likely a consequence of clonal selection rather than induction in ST6Gal-I gene expression. Similar results were noted for BxPC3 cells (Fig. 3, C and D); robust ST6Gal-I up-regulation was apparent in EV cells grown in 1% versus 10% serum. To monitor acute responses to serum deprivation, signaling was examined in cells incubated for 4, 18, or 24 h in medium containing either 10% or 1% FBS. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, OV4 OE cells displayed higher levels of pAkt than EV cells at all time points under 1% FBS culture conditions. Of note, there was a substantial decrease in pAkt in EV cells exposed to 1% FBS relative to 10% FBS, consistent with repression of survival signaling networks. We also evaluated phosphorylation of p70S6K, a kinase downstream of Akt that plays an important role in protein synthesis (26Berven L.A. Crouch M.F. Cellular function of p70S6K: a role in regulating cell motility.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The translation-promoting activity of p70S6K is necessary for growth factor-induced cell cycle progression (27Pearson R.B. Thomas G. Regulation of p70s6k/p85s6k and its role in the cell cycle.Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although there were no differences in p-p70S6K levels at 4 and 18 h between OV4 OE and EV cells, at 24 h, p-p70S6K levels were higher in the serum-starved OE population (Fig. 4, A and C). Studies using BxPC3 cells corroborated a role for ST6Gal-I in survival signaling. Compared with BxPC3 EV cells, KD cells exposed to 1% FBS exhibited a dramatic loss of pAkt at all time points (Fig. 5, A and B). Levels of p-p70S6K were also reduced in serum-starved KD versus EV cells at the 24-h time point (Fig. 5, A and C).FIGURE 5ST6Gal-I knockdown inhibits activation of prosurvival molecules upon acute serum deprivation.

Belardo G. Santoro M.G. NF-κB: a stress-regulated switch for cell survival.Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the effects of serum starvation on NFκB (p65) phosphorylation. Compared with the EV control, OV4 OE cells displayed increased pNFκB and total NFκB when grown for 24 h in 1% FBS (Fig. 6, A and C). Contrarily, serum-starved BxPC3 KD cells had reduced levels of pNFκB and total NFκB compared with EV cells (Fig. 6, B and D). We next assessed the expression of known NFκB transcriptional targets. As shown in Fig. 6E, OV4 OE cells expressed significantly higher levels of cIAP2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA than EV cells at 24 h regardless of the FBS concentration. IL-6 and IL-8, but not cIAP2, were also elevated in OE cells at the 6-h time point. Knockdown of ST6Gal-I in BxPC3 cells inhibited expression of these same targets (Fig. 6F). At 24 h, cIAP2 and IL-8 expression was reduced in KD cells relative to EV cells in 1% FBS medium, whereas IL-6 was decreased in KD cells in both 10% and 1% FBS medium. These data suggest that NFκB signaling pathways are more active in cells with high ST6Gal-I expression. One of the key downstream targets of NFκB is cyclin D2, a crucial cell cycle regulatory protein. Typically, when cells lack access to growth factors, they exit the cell cycle and enter G1 arrest (29Foster D.A. Yellen P. Xu L. Saqcena M. Regulation of G1 cell cycle progression: distinguishing the restriction point from a nutrient-sensing cell growth checkpoint(s).Genes Cancer. 2010; 1: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Because cyclin D2 controls the G1/S transition (29Foster D.A. Yellen P. Xu L. Saqcena M. Regulation of G1 cell cycle progression: distinguishing the restriction point from a nutrient-sensing cell growth checkpoint(s).Genes Cancer. 2010; 1: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of ST6Gal-I in regulating cyclin D2 expression. As shown in Fig. 7A, OV4 OE cells expressed higher levels of cyclin D2 mRNA than EV cells when grown in either 10% or 1% FBS. Intriguingly, at 24 h, cyclin D2 expression was higher in OE cells grown in 1% versus 10% FBS, which may reflect a compensatory survival response. ST6Gal-I also regulated cyclin D2 expression in BxPC3 cells (Fig. 7B). KD cells had reduced levels of cyclin D2 mRNA relative to EV cells regardless of FBS concentration. These results were validated by immunoblotting, which showed striking differences in cyclin D2 protein expression in cells with differential ST6Gal-I activity. OV4 OE cells had substantially greater levels of cyclin D2 than EV cells, which were further enriched in OE cells grown in 1% FBS (Fig. 7, C and E). Similarly, BxPC3 EV cells had greater levels of cyclin D2 than KD cells (Fig. 7, D and F). Cyclin D2 partners with select cyclin-dependent kinases to mediate phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), a molecule that represses transition into S phase (29Foster D.A. Yellen P. Xu L. Saqcena M. Regulation of G1 cell cycle progression: distinguishing the restriction point from a nutrient-sensing cell growth checkpoint(s).Genes Cancer. 2010; 1: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of pRB leads to pRb degradation, thus allowing the cell cycle to proceed. Serum-starved OV4 OE cells exhibited increased levels of both phosphorylated and total pRB compared with EV cells (Fig. 7, G and I), whereas serum-starved BxPC3 KD cells had diminished p-pRb and total pRb relative to EV cells (Fig. 7, H and J). These results suggest that ST6Gal-I activity promotes cyclin D2 expression and pRb phosphorylation, which would be expected to facilitate entry into S phase. To determine the role of ST6Gal-I in regulating cell cycle progression, we quantified the percentage of cells in S phase. To this end, cells were incubated with EdU, a thymidine analog th"

We have previously shown that heart mitochondrial proteins are hyperacetylated in OVE26 mice, a transgenic model of type 1 diabetes. However, the universality of this modification and its functional consequences are not well established. In this study, we demonstrate that Akita type 1 diabetic mice exhibit hyperacetylation. Functionally, isolated Akita heart mitochondria have significantly impaired maximal (state 3) respiration with physiological pyruvate (0.1 mm) but not with 1.0 mm pyruvate. In contrast, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is significantly decreased regardless of the pyruvate concentration. We found that there is a 70% decrease in the rate of pyruvate transport in Akita heart mitochondria but no decrease in the mitochondrial pyruvate carriers 1 and 2 (MPC1 and MPC2). The potential role of hyperacetylation in mediating this impaired pyruvate uptake was examined. The treatment of control mitochondria with the acetylating agent acetic anhydride inhibits pyruvate uptake and pyruvate-supported respiration in a similar manner to the pyruvate transport inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate. A mass spectrometry selective reactive monitoring assay was developed and used to determine that acetylation of lysines 19 and 26 of MPC2 is enhanced in Akita heart mitochondria. Expression of a double acetylation mimic of MPC2 (K19Q/K26Q) in H9c2 cells was sufficient to decrease the maximal cellular oxygen consumption rate. This study supports the conclusion that deficient pyruvate transport activity, mediated in part by acetylation of MPC2, is a contributor to metabolic inflexibility in the diabetic heart.

This study supports the conclusion that deficient pyruvate transport activity, mediated in part by acetylation of MPC2, is a contributor to metabolic inflexibility in the diabetic heart. Metabolic flexibility is essential for cardiac function. The heart normally generates 70% of its energy from fatty acids and ∼30% from carbohydrates (1Fukushima A. Lopaschuk G.D. Cardiac fatty acid oxidation in heart failure associated with obesity and diabetes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1860: 1525-1534Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 2Griffin T.M. Humphries K.M. Kinter M. Lim H.Y. Szweda L.I. Nutrient sensing and utilization: getting to the heart of metabolic flexibility.Biochimie. 2016; 124: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, with diabetes, the heart relies almost exclusively on fatty acid oxidation. This promotes diabetic cardiomyopathy via mechanisms that include lipotoxicity and loss of mitochondrial function. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with damaged mitochondria that have an impaired capacity to perform oxidative phosphorylation. However, changes in mitochondrial metabolic flexibility occur prior to overt defects in respiratory capacity. For example, we previously reported that heart mitochondria from a transgenic type 1 diabetic mouse model (OVE26 mice) have normal state 3 respiration rates when fatty acids, but not other oxidizable substrates, are supplied as the energy source (3Vadvalkar S.S.

The molecular mechanisms that induce metabolic inflexibility are complex.

Other changes to mitochondrial function may be mediated by increased acetylation of mitochondrial protein lysines (3Vadvalkar S.S. Baily C.N. Matsuzaki S. West M. Tesiram Y.A. Humphries K.M.

This reversible post-translational modification is implicated in regulating intermediary metabolism (1Fukushima A. Lopaschuk G.D.

Thus, overabundant acetylation may impede normal regulatory processes and contribute to metabolic inflexibility. pyruvate dehydrogenase α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone mitochondrial pyruvate carrier palmitoylcarnitine streptozotocin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor acetic anhydride selected reaction monitoring collision-induced dissociation oxygen consumption rate K19R/K26R K19Q/K26Q resolution. In the present work, we examine changes in mitochondrial function in Akita mouse hearts, a type 1 diabetic model that develops mitochondrial dysfunction (6Bugger H. Abel E.D. Rodent models of diabetic cardiomyopathy.Dis. Model. Mech. 2009; 2: 454-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We identify a decrease in pyruvate supported respiration, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, and pyruvate transport. Concurrently, there is hyperacetylation of mitochondrial proteins. We present evidence that acetylation inhibits pyruvate uptake. Using an MS-based selected reactive monitoring technique, we demonstrate that acetylation of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2 (MPC2) is significantly increased in Akita heart mitochondria. Experiments were performed to determine the relative capacity of Akita heart mitochondria to support mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation using either pyruvate or palmitoylcarnitine (PC). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, wild type and Akita mitochondria have comparable state 3 respiration rates with PC as the oxidizable substrate. State 4 respiration rates were also unchanged (not shown). This indicates that mitochondrial integrity is preserved in diabetic animals and that electron transport chain defects are not present at a magnitude that impairs the maximal rate of oxygen consumption. In contrast to PC, state 3 respiration was significantly impaired (26% decrease) when a physiological concentration of pyruvate (0.1 mm) was used. However, this decrease in respiration was largely attenuated (9% decrease; nonsignificant) when the concentration of pyruvate was increased to 1.0 mm in the assay. The decrease in pyruvate-supported respiration may be mediated, in part, by decreased PDH activity. PDH activity was measured in intact mitochondria preincubated with either 0.1 or 1.0 mm pyruvate and in the presence or absence of ADP. Preincubation of mitochondria with pyruvate and ADP initiates state 3 respiration and induces maximal PDH activity (7Crewe C. Kinter M. Szweda L.I. Rapid inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase: an initiating event in high dietary fat-induced loss of metabolic flexibility in the heart.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e77280Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After the indicated incubations, mitochondria were solubilized, and PDH activity was measured spectrophotometrically. The maximal rate of PDH activity was established in wild type mitochondria preincubated with 1.0 mm pyruvate and ADP (Fig. 1C). Under these conditions, PDH activity was 49% less in Akita heart mitochondria (Fig. 1B). In mitochondria preincubated with 0.1 mm pyruvate and ADP, PDH activity was 59% less in Akita mice than in wild types. This demonstrates that the magnitude of the decrease in PDH activity is not necessarily indicative of total respiratory loss under similar assay conditions (Fig. 1A). An essential factor for maximal respiratory capacity is the transport of substrates into the mitochondrial matrix. Indeed, pyruvate transport is the rate-limiting factor in cardiac mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (for a review, see Ref. 8Schell J.C. Rutter J. The long and winding road to the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier.Cancer Metab. 2013; 1: 6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore assayed pyruvate transport in wild type and Akita heart mitochondria by determining the α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC)-sensitive accumulation of [2-14C]pyruvate. As shown in Fig. 1D, the rate of pyruvate uptake in Akita heart mitochondria was 60% less than wild type controls. However, this decreased pyruvate uptake was not mediated by a decreased amount of MPC1 and MPC2 (Fig. 1E). This suggests that pyruvate transport activity may be decreased via another means, such as by post-translational modifications. We have previously reported that OVE26 type 1 diabetic mice have hyperacetylation of cardiac mitochondrial proteins (3Vadvalkar S.S. Baily C.N. Matsuzaki S. West M. Tesiram Y.A. Humphries K.M. Metabolic inflexibility and protein lysine acetylation in heart mitochondria of a chronic model of type 1 diabetes.Biochem. J. 2013; 449: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether the increase of this post-translational modification is common to other type 1 diabetic rodent models and, furthermore, whether this may contribute to impaired pyruvate-supported respiration. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, Akita heart mitochondria have a nearly 2-fold increase in acetylation compared with wild type controls. Likewise, protein acetylation is also significantly increased in STZ diabetic mice heart mitochondria (1.5-fold increase). Thus, increased mitochondrial protein acetylation is a common occurrence in multiple models of chronic type 1 diabetes. The increased occurrence of mitochondrial protein acetylation in diabetic samples reflects an increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation. When comparing the maximal rates of state 3 respiration in control heart mitochondria with either PC or pyruvate, the PC-supported rate is on average 33% faster (Fig. 2, C and D). In Akita heart mitochondria, PC-supported respiration is 79% faster (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, mice that lack the PPARα transcriptional factor, which regulates the levels of several fatty acid oxidation enzymes (9Finck B.N. The PPAR regulatory system in cardiac physiology and disease.Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 73: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), have a significant increase in the rate of state 3 respiration with pyruvate relative to PC (Fig. 2, C and D). Furthermore, mitochondria from PPARα−/− mouse hearts have a corresponding decrease (21%) in mitochondrial protein acetylation (Fig. 2, A and B). These results support that the preferential usage of fatty acids is accompanied by increased acetylation, and inversely less reliance on fatty acid utilization results in less mitochondrial acetylation. We next sought to determine whether hyperacetylation of mitochondrial proteins might contribute to the observed deficits in pyruvate-supported respiration and pyruvate uptake. Control and Akita heart mitochondria were treated with the acetylating agent acetic anhydride (Ac2O), which preferentially modifies the primary amine of lysines at neutral pH (3Vadvalkar S.S. Baily C.N. Matsuzaki S. West M. Tesiram Y.A. Humphries K.M. Metabolic inflexibility and protein lysine acetylation in heart mitochondria of a chronic model of type 1 diabetes.Biochem.

Differential labeling of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with acetic anhydride: substrate-induced conformational changes.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3018-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, control mitochondria treated with low concentrations of Ac2O exhibit a remarkably similar complement of acetylated proteins as are found endogenously in Akita heart mitochondria. This result is also similar to what we have previously reported in OVE26 heart mitochondria (3Vadvalkar S.S. Baily C.N. Matsuzaki S. West M. Tesiram Y.A. Humphries K.M. Metabolic inflexibility and protein lysine acetylation in heart mitochondria of a chronic model of type 1 diabetes.Biochem. J. 2013; 449: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Experiments were next performed to demonstrate that the acetylation of control mitochondria in vitro mimics the deficits in pyruvate-supported respiration observed in Akita mice. Treatment of control heart mitochondria with 10 μm Ac2O significantly inhibited state 3 respiration in the presence of 0.1 mm pyruvate (34% decrease). However, this effect was attenuated in mitochondria respiring with 1.0 mm pyruvate (13% decrease; Fig. 3B). In contrast, Ac2O treatment caused a slight but significant drop (16% decrease) in PC-supported state 3 respiration (Fig. 3B) but was independent of the PC concentration (not shown). Thus, pyruvate-supported respiration is more sensitive than PC-supported respiration to acetylation-mediated inhibition. Previous reports have shown that acetylation of the PDH complex inhibits its enzymatic activity (11Jing E. O'Neill B.T. Rardin M.J. Kleinridders A. Ilkeyeva O.R. Ussar S. Bain J.R. Lee K.Y.

SIRT3 deacetylates and increases pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in cancer cells.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2014; 76: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether Ac2O treatment of control mitochondria was inhibiting pyruvate-supported respiration by decreasing PDH activity. Treatment of control heart mitochondria with Ac2O had no effect on basal or maximal PDH activity regardless of the pyruvate concentration (Fig. 3C). This suggests that another aspect of pyruvate oxidation, such as substrate transport, may be inhibited by acetylation. Control mitochondria were therefore treated with Ac2O, and pyruvate uptake was measured. As shown in Fig. 3C, Ac2O (10 μm) inhibits the rate of pyruvate uptake by 44%. This supports that protein acetylation may represent a means for decreasing pyruvate transport and the overall rate of mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation. We hypothesized that if protein acetylation acts as a pyruvate transporter inhibitor then the effects of Ac2O on mitochondrial respiration should be similar to the classic pyruvate transport inhibitor CHC. We noted that CHC inhibits pyruvate supported state 3 respiration in a dose-dependent manner in coupled, control heart mitochondria (Fig. 4A). However, the sensitivity to CHC-mediated inhibition is significantly enhanced in uncoupled mitochondria (Fig. 4, B and C). For example, 1.0 μm CHC inhibits ADP- and FCCP-supported respiration by 15 and 50%, respectively (Fig. 4C). This enhanced inhibition is likely due to the drop in membrane potential that helps drive pyruvate uptake and not mediated by changes in either basal or maximal PDH activities. The maximal PDH activities are similar in control heart mitochondria treated with either ADP or FCCP and were unaffected by 1.0 μm CHC (Fig. 4D). We next examined the effect of Ac2O on coupled and uncoupled pyruvate-supported respiration in control heart mitochondria. Ac2O (10 μm), like CHC, preferentially inhibits uncoupled state 3 respiration (Fig. 5, A and B). This result supports that, in vitro, acetylation inhibits pyruvate-supported respiration in a manner similar to CHC. Our results indicate that the pyruvate-supported uncoupled/coupled respiration ratio acts as a functional indicator for detecting decreased pyruvate uptake. For example, this ratio is ∼0.78 in control mitochondria and decreases to 0.37 in CHC (1.0 μm)-treated mitochondria (Fig. 5C). Likewise, the ratio is also significantly decreased in Ac2O (10 μm)-treated control mitochondria to 0.49. Thus, hyperacetylation inhibits mitochondrial respiration in a manner similar to CHC. Finally, we found that the uncoupled/coupled respiration ratio is also significantly less in Akita mice (0.55) than in controls (Fig. 5C). This supports that decreased pyruvate uptake is a phenomenon in diabetic heart mitochondria and that it may be mediated by hyperacetylation. Pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, which is composed of the MPC1 and MPC2 proteins. Neither subunit is decreased in Akita heart mitochondria (Fig. 1E), and our biochemical characterization supports a role for acetylation in decreasing pyruvate uptake. We therefore focused our ensuing experiments on developing a selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assay to detect the acetylation of MPC subunits in Akita heart mitochondria. The SRM assay was developed by enriching MPCs from control heart mitochondria by immunoprecipitation and then acetylating the proteins with Ac2O prior to in-gel digestion and MS analysis. This approach allowed us to determine the retention times and CID spectra of specific acetylated peptides that may occur in vivo. This experiment resulted in the identification of MPC2 peptides containing acetylation sites at Lys-19, Lys-26, Lys-27, and Lys-122. Although MPC1 was successfully enriched (not shown), subsequent MS analysis failed to resolve acetylated peptides (see “Discussion”). Ensuing experiments performed to identify acetylation of lysines in vivo thus focused on MPC2 peptides. MPC2 was equally enriched by immunoprecipitation in control and Akita heart mitochondria (Fig. 6A). The enriched proteins were subjected to in-gel digestion and SRM analysis. We detected acetylation of Lys-19 and Lys-26 but not Lys-27 and Lys-122. Furthermore, the in vivo abundance of acetylation was significantly increased at Lys-19 (40%) and Lys-26 (80%) in Akita heart mitochondria relative to wild types (Fig. 6B). Collectively, our results demonstrate that Akita heart mitochondria have decreased pyruvate-supported respiration and pyruvate transport and hyperacetylation of MPC2. The functional significance of Lys-19 and Lys-26 acetylation was next evaluated by Seahorse XF analysis of oxygen consumption rates (OCRs). We first established that mitochondrial pyruvate transport activity can affect the OCR in H9c2 cells, a commonly used rat ventricular cell line that has a metabolic profile similar to primary cardiomyocytes (14Kuznetsov A.V. Javadov S. Sickinger S. Frotschnig S. Grimm M. H9c2 and HL-1 cells demonstrate distinct features of energy metabolism, mitochondrial function and sensitivity to hypoxia-reoxygenation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1853: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For the assay, cells were incubated with pyruvate as the lone nutrient, and the OCR was measured in the presence or absence of CHC. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, CHC significantly decreased the maximal OCR induced by the addition of FCCP. This establishes that the maximal OCR can be used as a proxy to evaluate mitochondrial pyruvate transport activity in H9c2 cells. We next generated MPC2 mutants to determine whether modifications of Lys-19 and Lys-26 can affect the rate of pyruvate transport. Glutamine approximates an acetylated lysine structurally and functionally, whereas arginine approximates a lysine that cannot be acetylated (15Tao R. Coleman M.C. Pennington J.D. Ozden O. Park S.H. Jiang H. Kim H.S. Flynn C.R. Hill S. Hayes McDonald W. Olivier A.K. Spitz D.R. Gius D.

Cell. 2010; 40: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). We expressed Myc-tagged MPC2 that was either wild type, a K19R/K26R (RR) double mutant, or a K19Q/K26Q (QQ) double mutant. The Myc tag was used to discern expressed proteins from endogenous MPC2. As shown in Fig. 7C, transfection of wild type or RR Myc-MPC2 resulted in similar protein levels. However, identical transfection conditions consistently resulted in less of the QQ double mutant. This reduced protein content was dependent upon both lysines being modified as the K19Q and K26Q single mutants were expressed at levels similar to wild type Myc-MPC2 (data not shown). Furthermore, we noted that none of the Myc-MPC2 constructs affected the endogenous levels of MPC2 (Fig. 6E). These results suggest modification of Lys-19 and Lys-26 in tandem may affect MPC2 structure or stability. We next evaluated whether expression of mutant MPC2 proteins can affect the cellular OCR. As shown in Fig. 7, D and E, wild type and RR Myc-MPC2 had no significant effects on basal or maximal OCR. In contrast, a significant decrease in basal and maximal OCRs was observed with expression of the QQ mutant. This decrease was dependent upon the double mutation as no significant changes in OCR were observed with either the single K19Q or K26Q mutation (data not shown). Collectively, these results support that modification of Lys-19 and Lys-26, as seen in the diabetic heart, can affect MPC2 stability and function. Mitochondrial deficits are an important contribution to diabetic cardiomyopathy (16Bugger H. Abel E.D. Molecular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy.Diabetologia. 2014; 57: 660-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, changes to mitochondrial function precede irreversible organelle damage. As we show here, Akita heart mitochondria display deficits in pyruvate- but not palmitoylcarnitine-supported respiration. This metabolic inflexibility is in agreement with our previous work in OVE26 heart mitochondria (3Vadvalkar S.S. Baily C.N. Matsuzaki S. West M. Tesiram Y.A. Humphries K.M. Metabolic inflexibility and protein lysine acetylation in heart mitochondria of a chronic model of type 1 diabetes.Biochem. J. 2013; 449: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Also like OVE26 animals, we show that Akita heart mitochondria have hyperacetylation of mitochondrial proteins. Our results here support acetylation as a means of decreasing metabolic flexibility via a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. This work establishes that hyperacetylation is a common occurrence in both Akita and STZ diabetic animals. We have previously shown that hyperacetylation is also present in OVE26 type 1 diabetic mice and in wild type mice fed a high fat diet (17Fernandes J. Weddle A. Kinter C.S. Humphries K.M. Mather T. Szweda L.I. Kinter M. Lysine acetylation activates mitochondrial aconitase in the heart.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of these post-translational modifications is uncertain. We provide evidence that the increase or decrease of this general protein modification is indicative of substrate preference. Less acetylation corresponds to lower palmitoylcarnitine respiration rates relative to pyruvate. Reciprocally, more acetylation corresponds to increased palmitoylcarnitine rates relative to pyruvate (Fig. 2). Thus, both hyper- and hypoacetylation may be signs of metabolic inflexibility and, consequentially, mitochondrial abnormalities. PDH is a primary site of metabolic regulation, and decreased cardiac PDH activity is a well established consequence of diabetes (1Fukushima A. Lopaschuk G.D. Cardiac fatty acid oxidation in heart failure associated with obesity and diabetes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1860: 1525-1534Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Wu P. Sato J. Zhao Y.

This loss of PDH activity may be mediated by overactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases or decreased PDH phosphatase activities. Consistent with this idea, we demonstrate that, in Akita heart mitochondria, PDH activity is decreased under basal conditions and fails to reach maximal rates of activity comparable with wild types under state 3 respiration conditions. A possible contributor to decreased PDH activity is the increased occurrence of mitochondrial acetylation. It has been previously shown that PDH is acetylated and that this decreases its activity (11Jing E. O'Neill B.T. Rardin M.J. Kleinridders A. Ilkeyeva O.R. Ussar S. Bain J.R. Lee K.Y. Verdin E.M.

However, the occurrence of this modification to PDH subunits in the diabetic heart is not currently known and will be important for future investigation. Our results demonstrate that the changes in metabolic flexibility in the Akita mouse heart are multifaceted. In addition to the decreased PDH activity, a deficit in pyruvate transport also contributes to metabolic inflexibility in the diabetic heart. This conclusion is supported by our observations that pyruvate-supported respiration can be increased in Akita heart mitochondria by increasing the amount of pyruvate and that the rate of pyruvate transport is decreased. The mitochondrial pyruvate transporter is composed of two components, MPC1 and MPC2 (20Bricker D.K. Taylor E.B. Schell J.C. Orsak T. Boutron A. Chen Y.C. Cox J.E. Cardon C.M. Van Vranken J.G.

https://openalex.org/W2581362192,"The KRAS GTPase plays a critical role in the control of cellular growth. The activity of KRAS is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and also post-translational modification. Lysine 104 in KRAS can be modified by ubiquitylation and acetylation, but the role of this residue in intrinsic KRAS function has not been well characterized.

Because the KRAS K104Q mutant has recently been employed as an acetylation mimetic, we conducted a series of studies to evaluate its in vitro and cell-based properties.

However, in response to growth-stimulatory signals, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 2The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorsGAPGTPase-activating proteinSWI and SWIIswitch I and II, respectivelyG domainguanine nucleotide binding domainPTMpost-translational modificationMDmolecular dynamicsMANT-GDP2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) guanosine 5′-diphosphate, disodium saltMANT-GMPPCP2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-β:γ-imidoguanosine 5′-triphosphate, trisodium saltRBDRAS binding domainHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceCSIchemical shift indexingRDCresidual dipolar couplingPDBProtein Data BankIPTGisopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranosideMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideMEFmouse embryo fibroblastTEVtobacco etch virus. co-localize and up-regulate RAS by facilitating exchange of GDP for GTP. Inactivation of RAS is achieved through GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that bind to GTP-bound RAS and promote GTP hydrolysis (1Geyer M. Wittinghofer A.

Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Several point mutations in RAS have been identified that dysregulate RAS nucleotide exchange or hydrolysis, often leading to hyperactivation and promoting tumorigenesis. The most common RAS mutations identified in cancer occur at residues 12, 13, and 61 and render RAS GAP defective, thereby populating RAS in its active GTP-bound state (3Cox A.D. Fesik S.W.

RAS contains two dynamic regions termed switch I (SWI; residues 30–37) and switch II (SWII; residues 60–76 with 66–74 corresponding to helix 2 (H2)) that populate distinct conformations when the protein is bound to GDP versus GTP. Effectors and GAP proteins recognize specific conformations of the switch regions and bind with preferential affinity to the active GTP- bound state. Activated GTP-bound RAS can interact with multiple effectors (e.g. RAF kinase, RAL exchange factors, phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the RAC-selective GEF TIAM1, phospholipase C, NORE1) to promote downstream signaling pathways that control cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (4Stephen A.G. Esposito D. Bagni R.K. McCormick F. Dragging ras back in the ring.Cancer Cell. 2014; 25: 272-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). RAS proteins show high sequence conservation within their core guanine nucleotide binding domain (G domain) yet possess a hypervariable C terminus. The hypervariable region undergoes a variety of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that facilitate membrane association and drive differences in localization and activity (5Ahearn I.M. Haigis K. Bar-Sagi D. Philips M.R. Regulating the regulator: post-translational modification of RAS.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Additionally, several lysines within the core G domain of RAS undergo post-translational modifications, including acetylation, ubiquitylation, and methylation (5Ahearn I.M. Haigis K. Bar-Sagi D. Philips M.R. Regulating the regulator: post-translational modification of RAS.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), but the role of these distinct modifications in regulating RAS function is still unclear. For example, KRAS monoubiquitylation at lysine 147 up-regulates RAS activity, signaling, and tumorigenesis (6Sasaki A.T. Carracedo A. Locasale J.W. Anastasiou D. Takeuchi K. Kahoud E.R. Haviv S. Asara J.M. Pandolfi P.P. Cantley L.C. Ubiquitination of K-Ras enhances activation and facilitates binding to select downstream effectors.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra13Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Additionally, lysine 104 has been shown to be a minor site of ubiquitylation, and we have previously shown that ubiquitylation of KRAS at this position does not alter the intrinsic biochemical properties or regulation by GEFs and GAPs (7Baker R. Wilkerson E.M. Sumita K. Isom D.G. Sasaki A.T. Dohlman H.G. Campbell S.L. Differences in the regulation of K-Ras and H-Ras isoforms by monoubiquitination.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 36856-36862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, lysine 104 acetylation was reported to down-regulate KRAS G12V-driven effector signaling and growth transformation in NIH 3T3 cells (8Yang M.H. Nickerson S. Kim E.T. Liot C. Laurent G. Spang R. Philips M.R. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Bar-Sagi D. Haigis M.C. Haigis K.M. Regulation of RAS oncogenicity by acetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

HDAC6 and SIRT2 regulate the acetylation state and oncogenic activity of mutant K-RAS.Mol. Cancer Res. 2013; 11: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Whereas knockdown of two deacetylases, HDAC6 and SIRT2, reduced the viability of NIH 3T3 cells expressing the oncogenic KRAS G12V mutant (9Yang M.H. Laurent G. Bause A.S. Spang R. German N. Haigis M.C. Haigis K.M. HDAC6 and SIRT2 regulate the acetylation state and oncogenic activity of mutant K-RAS.Mol. Cancer Res. 2013; 11: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), recent findings indicate that Ac-Lys104 is not a direct substrate for HDAC6 and SIRT2 under the conditions tested (10Knyphausen P.

A KRAS K104Q variant was used as an acetylation mimetic to evaluate how acetylation alters KRAS signaling. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that the KRAS K104Q mutation completely disrupts the structural integrity of H2 (8Yang M.H. Nickerson S. Kim E.T. Liot C. Laurent G. Spang R. Philips M.R. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Bar-Sagi D. Haigis M.C. Haigis K.M. Regulation of RAS oncogenicity by acetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 10843-10848Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), consistent with in vitro observations that SOS1-stimulated nucleotide exchange was impaired by 75%. However, the ability of KRAS K104Q to undergo GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis was not assessed (8Yang M.H. Nickerson S. Kim E.T. Liot C. Laurent G. Spang R. Philips M.R. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Bar-Sagi D. Haigis M.C. Haigis K.M. Regulation of RAS oncogenicity by acetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 10843-10848Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In NIH 3T3 cells, the K104Q mutation impaired KRAS G12V-driven effector signaling and growth transformation (8Yang M.H. Nickerson S. Kim E.T. Liot C. Laurent G. Spang R. Philips M.R. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Bar-Sagi D. Haigis M.C. Haigis K.M. Regulation of RAS oncogenicity by acetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 10843-10848Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To better understand how perturbations at position 104 of KRAS alter intrinsic biochemical properties, structure, and regulatory and effector interactions, we characterized mutations at this position, including a K104Q mutant that has previously been employed as an acetylation mimetic (8Yang M.H. Nickerson S. Kim E.T. Liot C. Laurent G. Spang R. Philips M.R. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Bar-Sagi D. Haigis M.C. Haigis K.M. Regulation of RAS oncogenicity by acetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 10843-10848Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We find that the K104Q mutation perturbed both GEF- and GAP-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis, respectively, yet did not alter either CRAF RAS binding domain (RBD) or PI3Kγ binding. However, in contrast to previous MD predictions, our NMR analyses indicated that KRAS K104Q does not fully disrupt SWII but rather causes a partial disruption of H2. Given these observations, we measured the thermal stability (melting temperature (Tm)) of WT, K104Q and Ac-Lys104 KRAS using circular dichroism (CD). We found that both K104Q and Ac-Lys104 show a modest decrease in Tm of 1.5 and 3.7 °C, respectively, relative to WT KRAS. Moreover, we found that K104Q did not significantly impair WT KRAS function, as measured by the ability to restore growth to Rasless mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). In slight contrast to a previous study, we also found that K104Q did not significantly alter mutant KRAS G12V effector signaling and induction of morphologic transformation. Taken together, our data indicate that the KRAS K104Q impairs the structural integrity of H2 and RAS regulation by GEFs and GAPs in vitro but does not significantly alter the steady-state level of GTP-bound protein in NIH 3T3 cells. Consistent with our findings that KRAS K104Q retains effector engagement in vitro and GTP levels in cells, the K104Q substitution did not significantly alter either WT KRAS or G12V biological activity. We postulate that the consequences of the K104Q substitution on GAP and GEF regulation probably offset each other to maintain the active GTP-bound state and effector signaling in cells. RAS proteins cycle between inactive GDP- and active GTP-bound states to coordinate downstream signaling and cellular growth. Lysine 104 in KRAS undergoes multiple PTMs, yet the role of this residue in intrinsic RAS function has not been well characterized. In the X-ray structure of KRAS bound to GDP (PDB code 4LPK), the side chain of lysine 104 interacts with the backbone carbonyl group of Arg73 and Gly75 contained within SWII. Disruption of these interactions has been proposed to perturb the structural integrity of SWII and alter interactions with regulatory proteins and effectors that interact with SWII (11Wittinghofer A. Pai E.F. The structure of Ras protein: a model for a universal molecular switch.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 382-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 12McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Interactions between Ras proteins and their effectors.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, Arg102 and Val103, surrounding Lys104 in H3, interact directly with the SOS catalytic domain (PDB code 1NVW) (13Margarit S.M. Sondermann H. Hall B.E. Nagar B. Hoelz A. Pirruccello M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Structural evidence for feedback activation by Ras·GTP of the Ras-specific nucleotide exchange factor SOS.Cell. 2003; 112: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Hence, mutations or PTMs that perturb these interactions may prevent proper SOS-mediated up-regulation of RAS. Consistent with these observations, it has been shown previously that KRAS K104Q disrupts SOScat-mediated nucleotide exchange (8Yang M.H. Nickerson S. Kim E.T. Liot C. Laurent G. Spang R. Philips M.R. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Bar-Sagi D. Haigis M.C. Haigis K.M. Regulation of RAS oncogenicity by acetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 10843-10848Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). KRAS K104Q has been dubbed an acetylation mimetic, yet how this mutation affects the structure of RAS, GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis, and effector recognition has not been determined. To further investigate the role of non-conservative and conservative mutations at this key position, we mutated residue Lys104 to glutamine, arginine, and alanine and monitored the rate of MANT-GDP nucleotide dissociation in the absence and presence of SOScat. As shown in Fig. 1A, all three mutations impaired SOS-mediated nucleotide exchange. In particular, a reduction in the rate of GDP dissociation by 78% for K104Q, 75% for K104R, and 50% for K104A was observed in comparison with WT KRAS (12.5 ± 0.2 × 10−4 s−1) (Fig. 1A and Table 1). All three mutations, even the K104R variant that retains the side chain positive charge, impaired SOS-mediated exchange. Although KRAS K104R has previously been reported to retain GEF activity (8Yang M.H. Nickerson S. Kim E.T. Liot C. Laurent G. Spang R. Philips M.R. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Bar-Sagi D. Haigis M.C. Haigis K.M. Regulation of RAS oncogenicity by acetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 10843-10848Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we find that this conservative substitution (K104R) impaired SOS regulation of RAS nucleotide exchange. These findings indicate that Lys104 plays an essential role in SOScat-mediated nucleotide exchange of KRAS. Because the K104Q variant was predicted to impair the structural integrity of SWII (8Yang M.H. Nickerson S. Kim E.T. Liot C. Laurent G. Spang R. Philips M.R. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Bar-Sagi D. Haigis M.C. Haigis K.M. Regulation of RAS oncogenicity by acetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 10843-10848Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which is also important for GAP-mediated down-regulation of RAS activity, we measured both the intrinsic and GAP-mediated rate of GTP hydrolysis (Table 1). Although the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis for KRAS K104Q is similar to that of WT KRAS, we found a significant reduction (53%) in the p120 GAPcat-stimulated rate of GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data suggest that the K104Q mutation, which has been used as a RAS acetylation mimic, impairs regulation of GDP/GTP cycling by both GEFs and GAPs.TABLE 1Biochemical properties of WT and KRas 104 mutantsPropertyWTK104QK104RK104ANucleotide exchange rate (10−4 s−1) Intrinsic2.0 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1 SOScat12.5 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.16.3 ± 0.1GTP hydrolysis rate (10−3 s−1) Intrinsic0.1 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.1 p120 GAPcat7.6 ± 0.53.6 ± 0.2Effector affinity (KD) (μm) BRAF RBD0.2 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.02 CRAF RBD0.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.1 PI3Kγ (p110 subunit, K802T)16.2 ± 6.117.2 ± 1.2 Open table in a new tab Upon GEF-mediated GDP exchange for GTP, RAS-GTP undergoes a conformational change in both the SWI and SWII regions. This in turn promotes binding to downstream effectors (14Mott H.R. Owen D. Structures of Ras superfamily effector complexes: what have we learnt in two decades?.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2015; 50: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although SWI is a primary binding site for a subset of RBDs (i.e. RAF and RALGEFs), some effectors (i.e. PI3K, PLCϵ, and NORE1) bind to RAS using both SWI and SWII regions (14Mott H.R. Owen D. Structures of Ras superfamily effector complexes: what have we learnt in two decades?.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2015; 50: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To assess whether the K104Q mutation alters KRAS effector interactions, we determined the binding affinity of KRAS K104Q to the RAS RBDs of CRAF and BRAF as well as PI3Kγ, by monitoring the dissociation rate of MANT-GMPPCP as function of RAS effector concentration (Table 1). Results from these analyses indicate that KRAS K104Q retains binding to RAF RBDs and PI3Kγ relative to WT RAS (Fig. 1C). To evaluate the effects of side chain modification at Lys104 on thermal stability, we measured the Tm for His6-WT KRAS, K104Q, and Ac-Lys104 by CD, by monitoring the thermal transition as a function of temperature, as shown in Fig. 2A. We found that K104Q and Ac-Lys104 KRAS showed similar cooperative unfolding transitions but possessed a lower Tm (K104Q (64.2 ± 0.1 °C), Ac-Lys104 (62.0 ± 0.5 °C)) in comparison with WT KRAS (65.8 ± 0.4 °C). The small Tm changes shown in Fig. 2B indicate that acetylation or mutation of the Lys104 side chain alters protein stability. Given the decrease in protein stability observed for KRAS K104Q, we conducted NMR studies to investigate whether the mutation alters KRAS structure. The RAS switch regions undergo distinct conformations when bound to either GDP or GTP. These conformational changes are key to recognition of GAPs and effector proteins as well as GTP-dependent SOS allosteric regulation (15Wittinghofer A. Vetter I.R. Structure-function relationships of the G domain, a canonical switch motif.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 943-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of KRAS bound to GDP (PDB code 4LPK), the Lys104 amino side chain interacts with the backbone carbonyls of Arg-73 and Gly-75 located at the end of SWII (see Fig. 5A). These interactions were previously predicted to play a key role in the structural integrity of SWII, because MD simulations suggested that both the KRAS K104Q mutation and Lys104 acetylation cause complete disruption of H2 within SWII (8Yang M.H. Nickerson S. Kim E.T. Liot C. Laurent G. Spang R. Philips M.R. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Bar-Sagi D. Haigis M.C. Haigis K.M. Regulation of RAS oncogenicity by acetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 10843-10848Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, given our findings that KRAS K104Q retains the ability to hydrolyze GTP (Fig. 1B), it is unlikely that helix 2 undergoes a full helix-coil transition upon mutation or acetylation. To better address this apparent discrepancy, we employed NMR spectroscopy to characterize structural and dynamic changes in KRAS upon mutation of lysine 104 to a glutamine. We first assigned the backbone resonances of WT and KRAS K104Q bound to Mg2+ and GDP by acquiring a series of triple resonance NMR experiments on 13C,15N-enriched KRAS 1–169 (16Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Heteronuclear multidimensional NMR experiments for the structure determination of proteins in solution employing pulsed field gradients.Prog. Nucl. Mag. Res. Spectr. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). We were able to assign 159 and 161 of 167 non-proline backbone NH, Cα, and Cβ resonances for WT and KRAS K104Q, respectively. A 2D 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectral overlay of K104Q and WT KRAS bound to GDP is shown in Fig. 3. 1H-15N HSQC spectra allow for the detection of protons directly bonded to a 15N, including both backbone and side chain NH resonances. Because an NH resonance can be detected for every residue with the exception of proline, the spectrum contains a “fingerprint” of the protein backbone. Inspection of chemical shift differences between KRAS WT and K104Q bound to GDP show that ∼30% of the backbone NH peaks undergo changes in peak position. Using chemical shift perturbation (CSP) analyses (Fig. 4A), we found that the largest CSPs (>0.2 ppm) corresponded to residues proximal to the site of the mutation (positions 102–110) and within SWII. Smaller (<0.2 ppm) CSPs were observed for residues within the first β-sheet. In contrast, residues in SWI do not show significant CSPs. These findings are consistent with perturbation of contacts between Lys104, Arg73, and Gly75 at the end of SWII due to mutation of Lys104 to glutamine.FIGURE 4K104Q causes structural and dynamic perturbations primarily in helix 2 and helix 3. A, NMR analyses of peak shifts reveal that the K104Q mutation causes large CSPs in switch II and residues 102–110 in helix 3 but minor changes in β1 and switch I. CSP was calculated based on weighted average chemical shift (square root of ((Δσ 1H)2 + (Δσ 15N)2/25)) of WT and K104Q KRAS NH peaks in 1H-15N 2D HSQC NMR spectra. B, differences in secondary structure were determined from Cα and Cβ chemical shift indexing. C, the difference in chemical shift indexing between K104Q and WT KRAS indicates that the KRAS K104Q mutation perturbs the local conformation surrounding 104 in H3 and the later part of the α2 helix (residues 71–74) in switch II. D, NH RDCs were obtained from alignment in Pf1 bacteriophage with deuterium splitting of ∼15 Hz. Switch I, switch II, and H3 are highlighted in pink (ribbon). NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on KRAS WT and K104Q (0.7 mm) bound to GDP using a Bruker Avance III 700 NMR spectrometer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because a comparison of Cα and Cβ chemical shifts can be used to evaluate differences in secondary structure (17Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. The 13C chemical-shift index: a simple method for the identification of protein secondary structure using 13C chemical-shift data.J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar), we employed chemical shift indexing (CSI) to compare secondary structural differences between K104Q and WT KRAS (Fig. 4B). We found that overall, the secondary structure of WT KRAS is similar to K104Q with the exception of H2 and H3. In contrast to MD predictions that KRAS K104Q completely disrupts the structural integrity of the SWII region, CSI analyses (Fig. 4C) indicate loss of secondary structure for residues 70–74 at the C-terminal end of H2 and loss of helical content for residues 102–103 in helix 3 (H3) near the mutation site (Fig. 4B), which is consistent with the Tm decrease observed for K104Q. These secondary structural changes correlate with the large CSP observed for these residues (Fig. 4A). The perturbed regions revealed by NMR are highlighted in the 3D structure (Fig. 5B). Small distortions in secondary structure were also observed for the first half of SWII, β1, and the loop between SWI and SWII. However, SWI is unperturbed, consistent with our findings that binding of K104Q to effector RBDs is retained (Fig. 1C). We also collected backbone NH residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data to generate long range distance constraints and evaluate changes in tertiary structure. As shown in Fig. 4D, comparison of the RDC profile for WT and KRAS K104Q indicates that the K104Q mutation does not significantly alter the overall tertiary structure of KRAS. The switch regions of RAS have been shown to sample multiple conformations in both the GDP- and GTP-bound states, as revealed by NMR (18Kraulis P.J. Domaille P.J. Campbell-Burk S.L. Van Aken T.

Engl. 2013; 52: 10771-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Conformational dynamic properties of these key regions are important for recognition of regulatory and effector proteins. Given the disruption in secondary structure within SWII, we evaluated whether the K104Q mutation alters backbone dynamic properties of KRAS, in the absence of regulatory proteins or effectors. We collected spin relaxation parameters R1 (Fig. 6A), R2 (Fig. 6B), and 15N-(1H) NOE (Fig. 6C) and fit them to spectral density functions for obtaining order parameters (21Lipari G. Szabo A. Model-free approach to the interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation in macromolecules. 1. Theory and range of validity.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). The order parameter S2 provides a measure of restriction of motion over the picosecond to nanosecond range; whereas S2 = 1 suggests that the NH vector is rigidly fixed in the molecular frame, S2 = 0 is indicative of high mobility. Consistent with an increase in backbone motion due to structural perturbations at residues proximal to the site of mutation and the C-terminal end of H2, reduced S2 values were observed in the loop (positions 104–107) between H3 and β5 (Fig. 6D) as well as for residues 72–73 in SWII. A smaller decrease in S2 is observed for residues in SWI. We also observed that the K104Q mutation slightly enhances fast time scale backbone motions for the loop preceding H2 and residues 94–96 in H3. Taken together, these observations are consistent with our findings that H2 and H3 undergo small scale structural distortions and that the altered GEF and GAP activities observed for KRAS K104Q are probably due to changes in protein structure rather than the altered switch dynamics. Because the KRAS K104Q mutation is impaired in GEF/GAP-mediated nucleotide cycling yet retains the ability to bind the RAF RBDs and PI3Kγ, we conducted studies in cell culture to determine the role of the K104Q mutation in KRAS-driven cellular growth. For these studies, we employed the use of Rasless MEFs, which lack endogenous Hras and Nras, and a conditional Kras allele that can be ablated by activation of a knocked-in 4-hydroxytamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase (22Drosten M.

We demonstrate that chloride cannot act as a two-electron donor of compound I, whereas thiocyanate, iodide, and bromide efficiently restore the ferric resting state. We present all relevant apparent bimolecular rate constants, the spectral signatures of the redox intermediates, and the standard reduction potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple, and we demonstrate that the prosthetic heme group is post-translationally modified and cross-linked with the protein. These structural features provide the basis of human peroxidasin 1 to act as an effective generator of hypobromous acid, which mediates the formation of covalent cross-links in collagen IV. Human peroxidasin 1 is a homotrimeric multidomain peroxidase that is secreted to the extracellular matrix. The heme enzyme was shown to release hypobromous acid that mediates the formation of specific covalent sulfilimine bonds to reinforce collagen IV in basement membranes. Maturation by proteolytic cleavage is known to activate the enzyme. Here, we present the first multimixing stopped-flow study on a fully functional truncated variant of human peroxidasin 1 comprising four immunoglobulin-like domains and the catalytically active peroxidase domain.

Type IV collagen α chains form triple helical protomers that self-assemble with end-to-end C-terminal associations known as NC1 hexamers. Peroxidasin 1 oxidizes bromide to hypobromous acid, which is responsible for the generation of a highly specific sulfilimine bond between opposing methionine and hydroxylysine residues that bridge the trimer-trimer interface of the NCI hexamer thereby structurally reinforcing the collagen IV network (2McCall A.S.

In addition to the catalytic peroxidase domain (POX), hsPxd01 comprises a leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR) and four C-like immunoglobulin domains (Ig) at the N terminus and a C-terminal von Willebrand factor type C module (VWC), all known to be important for protein-protein interactions and cell adhesion. Moreover, mature human peroxidasin 1 is shown to be highly glycosylated and to form a homotrimer via intermolecular disulfide bonds (5Soudi M. Paumann-Page M. Delporte C. Pirker K.F. Bellei M.

The peroxidase domain displays high homology to that of the well characterized chordata peroxidases lactoperoxidase (LPO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) with the highest similarity to LPO. Comparative sequence analysis clearly suggests that in the active site of hsPxd01 all amino acid residues, which are crucial to peroxidase and halogenation activity, are fully conserved (5Soudi M.

It has been reported that the catalytic efficiency of bromide oxidation (kcat/Km) of recombinant full-length hsPxd01 is rather low but increased upon truncation (5Soudi M. Paumann-Page M. Delporte C. Pirker K.F. Bellei M. Edenhofer E. Stadlmayr G. Battistuzzi G. Boudjeltia K.Z. Furtmüller P.G. Van Antwerpen P. Obinger C.

This was confirmed in a recent study that showed the cleavage of trimeric hsPxd01 at Arg1336 C-terminal of the peroxidase domain by a proprotein convertase (8Colon S. Bhave G. Proprotein convertase processing enhances peroxidasin activity to reinforce collagen IV.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 24009-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The truncation eliminates the von Willebrand factor and renders the peroxidase more active. This proteolytic maturation seems to represent a key regulatory event in hsPxd01 biosynthesis and function because the C-terminal proprotein convertase recognition sequence is evolutionarily conserved throughout the animal kingdom (8Colon S. Bhave G. Proprotein convertase processing enhances peroxidasin activity to reinforce collagen IV.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 24009-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this work, to study the reactivity of the peroxidase domain and the effect of other domains on catalysis, several truncated variants of hsPxd01 were expressed recombinantly in HEK cells (5Soudi M. Paumann-Page M. Delporte C. Pirker K.F. Bellei M. Edenhofer E. Stadlmayr G. Battistuzzi G. Boudjeltia K.Z. Furtmüller P.G. Van Antwerpen P. Obinger C.

Chem. 2015; 290: 10876-10890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One monomeric construct composed of the four Ig domains and the peroxidase domain (hsPxd01-con4) (Fig. 1A) was superior in terms of yield, heme insertion, spectroscopic features, and catalytic activity. This allowed for the first time a comprehensive study of the kinetics of interconversion of the relevant redox intermediates of the halogenation cycle. Here, we report the standard reduction potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple of the peroxidase domain and apparent bimolecular rate constants for cyanide binding as well as the formation and reduction of compound I mediated by hydrogen peroxide, bromide, iodide, and thiocyanate at pH 7.4. Based on the available structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic data of the homologous human peroxidases, we provide a mechanism for the halogenation cycle of human peroxidasin 1, and we discuss its relevance for its biosynthetic function in collagen IV cross-linking. Transient expression of hsPxd01-con4 in HEK cells resulted in a yield of purified protein of ∼10–20 mg/liter medium. The protein was composed of the amino acid residues Pro246–Asp1314 (numbers referring to full-length hsPxd01, including the signal peptide (5Soudi M. Paumann-Page M. Delporte C. Pirker K.F. Bellei M.

The construct included the four immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and the POX domain. In SDS-PAGE under both aerobic and reducing conditions, the corresponding band appeared at a slightly higher molar mass (Fig. 1B, left panel) because hsPxd01 is highly glycosylated with eight confirmed N-glycosylation sites located in the hsPxd01-con4 region (5Soudi M. Paumann-Page M. Delporte C. Pirker K.F. Bellei M. Edenhofer E. Stadlmayr G. Battistuzzi G. Boudjeltia K.Z. Furtmüller P.G. Van Antwerpen P. Obinger C.

Chem. 2015; 290: 10876-10890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The heme of this construct was post-translationally modified and covalently bound to the protein that was clearly demonstrated by SDS-PAGE in combination with the enhanced chemiluminescence staining procedure (Fig. 1B, right panel). Covalent attachment of the prosthetic group could also be confirmed by precipitation of the recombinant protein by acetone at pH 4.5 resulting in colorless supernatants (data not shown). Furthermore, the determined spectral and redox properties clearly suggested the establishment of heme-protein bonds (see below). It is well known that these post-translational modifications considerably influence both the spectral signatures of a heme protein in its ferric state and the standard reduction potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple (9Battistuzzi G. Stampler J. Bellei M. Vlasits J. Soudi M. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C.

Chem. 2014; 289: 31480-31491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this context, it is important to note that the purification protocol (see under “Experimental Procedures”) could be significantly improved by including a 48-h incubation step prior to buffer exchange and affinity chromatography. This period seemed to be necessary for establishment of covalent bonds. The modification of the prosthetic group is reflected by a gradual transition of the UV-visible spectrum of freshly purified hsPxd01-con4. Spectral transition included a red-shift of the Soret band from 410 to 412 nm together with establishment of Q-bands at 510, 547, and 590 nm and a charge transfer (CT) band at 637 nm (Fig. 1C, green spectrum). This spectrum is reminiscent of that of ferric LPO (Fig. 1C, gray spectrum). The peroxidase domain of hsPxd01 has a high amino acid sequence homology with LPO (34% identity and 53% similarity) (5Soudi M. Paumann-Page M. Delporte C. Pirker K.F. Bellei M. Edenhofer E. Stadlmayr G. Battistuzzi G. Boudjeltia K.Z. Furtmüller P.G. Van Antwerpen P. Obinger C. Multidomain human peroxidasin 1 is a highly glycosylated and stable homotrimeric high spin ferric peroxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 10876-10890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the known crystal structure of LPO, continuous electron densities underline the presence of two ester bonds between the modified prosthetic heme group and conserved Asp and Glu residues (7Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Jantschko W. Helm J. Bogner M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Active site structure and catalytic mechanisms of human peroxidases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 445: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment and modeling demonstrated that these acidic amino acids are fully conserved in hsPxd01 (i.e. Asp826 and Glu980) (3Zamocky M. Jakopitsch C. Furtmüller P.G. Dunand C. Obinger C.

Chem. 2015; 290: 10876-10890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Heme modification was also underlined by spectroelectrochemical studies on hsPxd01-con4. Fig. 2 shows a representative redox titration with fully oxidized and fully reduced hsPxd01-con4 depicted in green and brown, respectively. Upon reduction, the Soret peak of the ferric protein shifted from 412 to 435 nm (Fig. 2) very similar to 5-coordinated ferrous lactoperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase (11Battistuzzi G. Bellei M. Vlasits J. Banerjee S. Furtmüller P.G. Sola M. Obinger C. Redox thermodynamics of lactoperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 494: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). From the corresponding Nernst plot (Fig. 2B), the standard reduction potential (E′0) of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple was calculated to be −0.128 ± 0.006 V (25 °C and pH 7.4). Before investigating the kinetics of compound I formation and reduction, we probed the accessibility of the heme cavity and the homogeneity of the architecture of the active site by monitoring the kinetics of cyanide binding. It has been demonstrated that the post-translational modification of the prosthetic group in peroxidases from the heme peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily is often not fully established resulting in some structural heterogeneity of the heme cavity that can easily be probed by studying the kinetics of cyanide binding (7Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Jantschko W. Helm J. Bogner M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Active site structure and catalytic mechanisms of human peroxidases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 445: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 10Auer M. Nicolussi A. Schütz G. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C.

Chem. 2014; 289: 31480-31491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the case of hsPxd01-con4, cyanide binding resulted in the transition of the high spin (S = 5/2) Fe(III) state to the low spin (S = 1/2) Fe(III) state (Soret maximum at 431 nm, bands at 558 and 588 nm, and loss of the CT band at 637 nm) with clear isosbestic points at 423, 494, 519, 623, and 666 nm (Fig. 3A). Binding of the ligand was biphasic with a dominating rapid first phase and a slower second phase (Fig. 3B). From the double exponential fit of these time traces, first-order rate constants (kobs(1) and kobs(2)) were obtained and plotted versus cyanide concentration. From the corresponding linear plots (Fig. 3C), an apparent second-order rate constant kon(1) for the dominating rapid phase was calculated to be (7.9 ± 0.2) × 105 m−1 s−1 (koff = (3.3 ± 0.7) s−1 and KD(1) = koff/kon = 4.2 μm) at pH 7.4 and 25 °C, which compares with 1.3 × 106 m−1 s−1 and KD = 4.3 μm for human MPO (12Bolscher B.G. Wever R. A kinetic study of the reaction between human myeloperoxidase, hydroperoxides and cyanide. Inhibition by chloride and thiocyanate.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and 1.3 × 106 m−1 s−1 and KD = 23.8 μm for bovine LPO (13Dolman D. Dunford H.B. Chowdhury D.M. Morrison M. The kinetics of cyanide binding by lactoperoxidase.Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3991-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). From the plot of kobs(2) values versus cyanide concentration, an apparent kon(2) of (8.8 ± 0.2) × 103 m−1 s−1 (koff(2) = (0.40 ± 0.08) s−1 and a KD(2) = 45.5 μm) (data not shown) was calculated for the minor second phase. These binding parameters are comparable with recently reported values for a recombinant bacterial peroxidase from the cyanobacterium Lyngbya sp. PCC 8106, which features autocatalytically formed covalent heme to protein links (10Auer M. Nicolussi A. Schütz G. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. How covalent heme to protein bonds influence the formation and reactivity of redox intermediates of a bacterial peroxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 31480-31491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Like the peroxidase domain of hsPxd01, the bacterial peroxidase has a high amino acid sequence homology with LPO, and the prosthetic group is covalently attached to the protein via two ester bonds. The reaction of the ferric bacterial protein with cyanide also showed a biphasic behavior with a dominating rapid phase. In both cases in a small portion of the protein the post-translational modification of the prosthetic group was not fully accomplished resulting in some heterogeneity of the active site and in consequence in the kinetics and thermodynamics of cyanide binding. To act as peroxidase in extracellular cross-linking reactions, peroxidasin must be oxidized by peroxides. Here, we showed that hydrogen peroxide efficiently converted the ferric form of hsPxd01-con4 into the redox intermediate compound I. Fig. 4A shows that this reaction was reflected by a spectral transition with isosbestic points at 360 and 443 nm, hypochromicity in the Soret absorbance (maximum at 410 nm), and the establishment of a new band around 670 nm (Fig. 4, red spectrum). Similar to LPO (14Furtmüller P.G. Jantschko W. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Arnhold J. Obinger C. Reaction of lactoperoxidase compound I with halides and thiocyanate.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11895-11900Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), maximum hypochromicity was already achieved with equimolar H2O2 within 200 ms (Fig. 4A). Analogous to LPO (14Furtmüller P.G. Jantschko W. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Arnhold J. Obinger C. Reaction of lactoperoxidase compound I with halides and thiocyanate.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11895-11900Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), compound I of hsPxd01-con4 was not stable but slowly converted to a compound II-like species (Fig. 4, blue spectrum). The kinetics of hsPxd01-con4 oxidation mediated by H2O2 was followed by the decrease of absorbance at 412 nm. The reaction was biphasic with a dominating rapid first phase (>80% of ΔA412 nm). The corresponding pseudo first-order rate constants kobs(1) and kobs(2) were obtained from double exponential fits. From the slope of the plots of the respective kobs values versus hydrogen peroxide concentration, the apparent bimolecular rate constants for the dominating phase kapp(1), (1.8 ± 0.1) × 107 m−1 s−1 (Fig. 4C), and the second phase kapp(2), (6.9 ± 0.6) × 105 m−1 s−1 (data not shown), were calculated, pH 7.4. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that the rate of compound I formation was invariant within the pH range of 5.0–9.0 (Fig. 4D). A pK1 value of 4.7 and a pK2 value of 9.0 were calculated from the fit kapp = a/(1 + x/b) × (1 + c/x) with a representing kinternal; x is the concentration of H+; b is pK1, and c is pK2. The first inflection point might reflect the pKa of the distal histidine that acts as proton acceptor in compound I formation of heme peroxidases (7Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Jantschko W. Helm J. Bogner M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Active site structure and catalytic mechanisms of human peroxidases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 445: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), whereas the second one could be related with the alkaline transition of hsPxd01-con4. The UV-visible spectrum of the ferric high spin protein is invariant between pH 5 and 8.0 (5Soudi M. Paumann-Page M. Delporte C. Pirker K.F. Bellei M. Edenhofer E. Stadlmayr G. Battistuzzi G. Boudjeltia K.Z. Furtmüller P.G. Van Antwerpen P. Obinger C. Multidomain human peroxidasin 1 is a highly glycosylated and stable homotrimeric high spin ferric peroxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 10876-10890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) but converts to a low spin spectrum with red-shifted Soret band (430 nm) at pH values >8.5 most probably reflecting the formation of a low spin hydroxide complex. Addition of excess hydrogen peroxide to ferric hsPxd01-con4 converts the enzyme from the ferric state via compound I to compound II (oxoiron(IV) species) and, finally, to compound III, which resembles electronically oxyhemoglobin or oxymyoglobin (i.e. Fe(II)-O2 ↔ Fe(III)-O2̇̄) (Fig. 5). When hsPxd01-con4 was mixed with a 50-fold molar excess of hydrogen peroxide, the formation of predominantly compound II was observed with a heme Soret maximum at 432 nm and a broad Q band at 535 nm with a shoulder at 564 nm (Fig. 5, blue spectrum). With a 1000-fold molar excess of H2O2, compound II was converted to compound III resulting in a distinct UV-visible spectrum with a heme Soret maximum at 425 nm and prominent Q-bands at 552 and 588 nm (Fig. 5, cyan spectrum). It was interesting to see that in contrast to LPO (14Furtmüller P.G. Jantschko W. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Arnhold J. Obinger C. Reaction of lactoperoxidase compound I with halides and thiocyanate.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11895-11900Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) but similar to myeloperoxidase (7Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Jantschko W. Helm J. Bogner M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Active site structure and catalytic mechanisms of human peroxidases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 445: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), the conversion of compound I to compound II was also dependent on the hydrogen peroxide concentration (Fig. 6). After incubating hsPxd01-con4 with equimolar H2O2 in the aging loop of the stopped-flow instrument for 200 ms, formed compound I was mixed with increasing concentrations of H2O2. Formation of compound II clearly depended on the H2O2 concentration, and from the biphasic time traces (Fig. 6B), kapp of the dominating initial reaction was calculated to be (1.3 ± 0.03) × 104 m−1 s−1 (Fig. 6C). Next, we probed the reactivity of hsPxd01-con4 compound I with the halides chloride, bromide, iodide, and the pseudo-halide thiocyanate. Again, the sequential mode was used to form compound I by preincubating hsPxd01-con4 with an equimolar concentration of hydrogen peroxide for 200 ms before the halides were added. Fig. 7A shows the direct conversion of compound I back to the ferric enzyme upon addition of bromide. In contrast to the reaction of the ferric enzyme with cyanide and hydrogen peroxide, compound I reduction by bromide was monophasic (Fig. 7B) and allowed the calculation of an apparent bimolecular rate kapp = (5.6 ± 0.4) × 106 m−1 s−1 at pH 7.4 (Fig. 7C). Because hypobromous acid formation was reported to be essential for the formation of the sulfilimine link (1Bhave G. Cummings C.F. Vanacore R.M. Kumagai-Cresse C. Ero-Tolliver I.A. Rafi M. Kang J.-S. Pedchenko V. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Hudson B.G. Peroxidasin forms sulfilimine chemical bonds using hypohalous acids in tissue genesis.Nat. Chem.

Bromine is an essential trace element for assembly of collagen IV scaffolds in tissue development and architecture.Cell. 2014; 157: 1380-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the pH dependence of the kinetics of bromide oxidation was investigated. Fig. 7D depicts the corresponding plot of the logarithm of first-order rate constants kobs versus pH. Between pH 4 and pH 6, the reaction was fast and pH-independent but decreased with increasing pH. Importantly, chloride cannot act as an electron donor for compound I of hsPxd01-con4. Even in the presence of chloride concentrations ≫10 mm added to 1 μm hsPxd01-con4 compound I, no formation of the ferric enzyme could be detected. In the presence of chloride, compound I slowly converted to an intermediate with a compound II-like spectrum (data not shown). However, upon addition of 5 μm Br− to 100 mm Cl−, the direct reduction of compound I to ferric hsPxd01-con4 could be observed (data not shown). By contrast, the reaction of hsPxd01-con4 compound I with thiocyanate and iodide was very fast and resulted in a direct conversion of compound I to the ferric state. The spectral transition was almost identical to that observed with bromide. Fig. 8, A and B, shows representative monophasic time traces that could be fitted single exponentially. The apparent bimolecular rate constants were calculated to be (1.8 ± 0.07) × 107 m−1 s−1 and (1.7 ± 0.067) × 107 m−1 s−1 for the reaction with thiocyanate and iodide at pH 7.4 (Fig. 8, C and D). For the first time, a truncated variant of hsPxd01 was produced in appreciable yield, good quality, and high activity, which allowed for pre-steady-state kinetic measurements to evaluate the substrate specificity and the mechanism of halide oxidation of human peroxidasin 1. So far, only steady-state (5Soudi M. Paumann-Page M. Delporte C. Pirker K.F. Bellei M. Edenhofer E. Stadlmayr G. Battistuzzi G. Boudjeltia K.Z. Furtmüller P.G. Van Antwerpen P. Obinger C.

https://openalex.org/W2584738360,"Naturally occurring mutations in the ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase, telomerase, are associated with the bone marrow failure syndromes dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, the mechanism by which these mutations impact telomerase function remains unknown. Here we present the structure of the human telomerase C-terminal extension (or thumb domain) determined by the method of single-wavelength anomalous diffraction to 2.31 Å resolution. We also used direct telomerase activity and nucleic acid binding assays to explain how naturally occurring mutations within this portion of telomerase contribute to human disease. The single mutations localize within three highly conserved regions of the telomerase thumb domain referred to as motifs E-I (thumb loop and helix), E-II, and E-III (the FVYL pocket, comprising the hydrophobic residues Phe-1012, Val-1025, Tyr-1089, and Leu-1092). Biochemical data show that the mutations associated with dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis disrupt the binding between the protein subunit reverse transcriptase of the telomerase and its nucleic acid substrates leading to loss of telomerase activity and processivity. Collectively our data show that although these mutations do not alter the overall stability or expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase, these rare genetic disorders are associated with an impaired telomerase holoenzyme that is unable to correctly assemble with its nucleic acid substrates, leading to incomplete telomere extension and telomere attrition, which are hallmarks of these diseases.

These TBE-binding motifs are located at the interface of the TRBD and fingers domains, and together they form a well defined indentation on the surface of the protein providing the platform for a network of nonspecific interactions with the TBE (13Jansson L.I.

Although CR4/5 is primarily coordinated by the TRBD, its stem loop P6.1 extends across the TRBD-thumb interface and binds the FVYL pocket of the thumb domain (6Bryan C. Rice C. Hoffman H.

Extensive interactions between the CR4/5 and the terminal domains of the TERT ring most likely stabilize the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex and lock the closed ring configuration of TERT during telomere elongation. Several naturally occurring mutations within the thumb domain contribute to the rare genetic disorders dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), aplastic anemia (AA), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). With the exception of AA, which is acquired, these disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern (16Alder J.K. Chen J.J. Lancaster L. Danoff S. Su S.C. Cogan J.D. Vulto I. Xie M. Qi X.

DKC affects multiple parts of the body including nail shape and growth, skin discoloration, and oral leukoplakia (20Bessler M. Wilson D.B. Mason P.J.

Genet. 2008; 73: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Patients affected by DKC may also develop aplastic anemia, a bone marrow failure disorder that interferes with the production of normal levels of red blood cells (23Dokal I. Vulliamy T. Dyskeratosis congenita: its link to telomerase and aplastic anaemia.Blood Rev. 2003; 17: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). DKC patients are also high risk for IPF, a disease associated with lung scaring and decrease in oxygen transport to the body (24Tsakiri K.D. Cronkhite J.T. Kuan P.J. Xing C. Raghu G. Weissler J.C. Rosenblatt R.L. Shay J.W. Garcia C.K. Adult-onset pulmonary fibrosis caused by mutations in telomerase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7552-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In addition to AA and IPF, DKC patients are also high risk cases for cancers of the neck, head, genitals, and anus. In its most severe form, DKC patients develop Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome usually associated with an unusually small cerebellum and impairment of motor skills (25Knight S.W. Heiss N.S. Vulliamy T.J. Aalfs C.M. McMahon C. Richmond P. Jones A. Hennekam R.C. Poustka A. Mason P.J. Dokal I. Unexplained aplastic anaemia, immunodeficiency, and cerebellar hypoplasia (Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome) due to mutations in the dyskeratosis congenita gene, DKC1.Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 107: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Here we report the structure of the human telomerase thumb domain and explain the role of the naturally occurring mutations in human disease. The structure reveals that the majority of these mutations localize to the nucleic acid binding regions of the protein, which includes motifs E-I, E-II, and E-III. Biochemical assays show that these disease-associated mutations interfere with proper telomerase elongation complex formation leading to telomere attrition and loss of cell viability. We identified a construct of the human telomerase thumb domain (hThumb) consisting of residues 961–1132 by limited proteolysis (Fig. 1A). A longer construct consisting of residues 941–1132, which contains the thumb loop, a portion of motif E-I (3Gillis A.J. Schuller A.P. Skordalakes E. Structure of the Tribolium castaneum telomerase catalytic subunit TERT.Nature. 2008; 455: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), produced low protein yields sufficient for biochemical but not crystallographic studies. We subsequently solved the structure of hThumb 961–1132 to 2.31 Å resolution using the method of single-wavelength anomalous dispersion and a mercury derivative (Table 1). The structure revealed clear density for residues 965–1122 (Fig. 1C). The structure is an all helical bundle (Fig. 1, B and D) and is structurally conserved with the Tribolium telomerase thumb domain (tcThumb; root mean square deviation, 2.5 Å) (Fig. 1, E and F). Within this domain there are three conserved motifs (E-I, E-II, and E-III; Fig. 1, B and C) involved in nucleic acid binding (2Mitchell M. Gillis A. Futahashi M. Fujiwara H. Skordalakes E. Structural basis for telomerase catalytic subunit TERT binding to RNA template and telomeric DNA.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 3Gillis A.J. Schuller A.P. Skordalakes E. Structure of the Tribolium castaneum telomerase catalytic subunit TERT.Nature. 2008; 455: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Of note is the displacement of part of motif E-I by the same helix of a crystallographic symmetry related molecule (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). The flexibility of a small portion of E-I of the isolated thumb domain can be attributed to the absence of contacts with the TRBD domain observed in the full-length TERT, which stabilize this motif (2Mitchell M. Gillis A. Futahashi M. Fujiwara H. Skordalakes E. Structural basis for telomerase catalytic subunit TERT binding to RNA template and telomeric DNA.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Occupation of the displaced helix by a crystal symmetry-related one further confirms the structural and functional conservation of this helix in telomerases across species.TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsNativePhasing: Hg derivative 1Data collection Wavelength (Å)1.54181.5418 Space groupP321P321 Cell dimensions: a, b, c (Å)92.4, 50.292.9, 49.9 Resolution (Å)20–2.31 (2.25–2.31)30–2.9 (3.05–2.9) I/σI18.7 (2.19)12.3 (1.0) Completeness (%)99.9 (98.3)99.6 (96.4) Redundancy12 (12.7)28 (29.4)Phasing analysis Resolution (Å)30–2.9 Number of sites5 SKEW (Phenix)aSKEW, distribution of electron density values in an experimentally phased map.0.20 CORR_RMS (Phenix)bCORR_RMS, a measure of how contiguous the solvent and non-solvent regions are in the map.0.86 Mean figure of merit0.37Refinement Resolution (Å)20–2.31 No. reflections11191 Rwork/Rfree20.0/21.6 Estimated twinning fraction0.358 for -h,-k,-l No. atomsNon-solvent1289Water12 B-factorsProtein43.6Water59.6 Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.008Bond angles (°)1.186 Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored97Allowed3a SKEW, distribution of electron density values in an experimentally phased map.b CORR_RMS, a measure of how contiguous the solvent and non-solvent regions are in the map. Open table in a new tab Another highly conserved region of the hThumb is the FVYL pocket formed by the loops that connect motifs E-I, E-II, and E-III and was previously suggested to bind the P6.1 stem loop of CR4/5 (6Bryan C. Rice C. Hoffman H. Harkisheimer M. Sweeney M. Skordalakes E. Structural basis of telomerase inhibition by the highly specific BIBR1532.Structure. 2015; 23: 1934-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The FVYL pocket is located at the interface of the TRBD-thumb domain and is ∼12 Å away from the nearest TRBD residue. The human FVYL pocket is the result of a small gap, generated by the organization of the tips and connecting loops of helices α2, α3, and α4, α5 (Fig. 1, B and D). The organization of the tips of these helices generates a gap 14 Å wide and 8 Å deep and is sufficient to accommodate 2–3 nucleotide bases. The solvent-exposed, hTERT loop that connects helices α2 and α3 makes extensive interactions with the TRBD and contributes to the closed ring TERT configuration. In the absence of contacts with TRBD, this loop is flexible with Val-1025 partially occupying the FVYL pocket (Fig. 1, B and D). It is worth noting that the high salt crystal growth conditions may have also facilitated binding of Val-1025 into this hydrophobic region of the protein. To better understand the role of hThumb mutations in human disease, we tested the ability of these mutant proteins to bind an RNADNA hybrid (hRNADNA) consisting of the human telomerase RNA template (CUAACCCU) and telomeric DNA (AGGGTTAG). To perform these assays, we overexpressed and purified to homogeneity the hThumb WT and R972H, R979W, C1015R, L1019F V1025F, N1028H, K1050E, and V1090M mutant proteins. We tested these proteins for binding to the hRNADNA hybrid using fluorescence polarization (FP) assays. It is worth noting that the V1025F mutant protein appears to aggregate in solution when overexpressed as an independent domain, and therefore we were unable to obtain a reliable Kd for this protein. The WT, hThumb binds the hRNADNA hybrid with ∼450 nm binding affinity (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Table S1). The mutant proteins located in motif E-I and E-II and make direct contacts with the hRNADNA hybrid (R972H, R979W, and K1050E) showed significantly lower affinity (2.6-, 4-, and 2.4-fold) for the hRNADNA hybrid than the WT protein. Similarly, the C1015R mutant, which contributes to the structural organization of this region of the protein and therefore the binding of the hRNADNA hybrid, also showed significantly lower affinity for the hRNADNA hybrid (4.6-fold) than the WT protein. Surprisingly, the L1019F showed almost wild type affinity for the hRNADNA hybrid (1.3-fold) compared with the WT protein (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Table S1). Contrary to the mutations that contribute to hybrid binding, N1028H and V1090M showed a slight (1.5-fold) decrease in hRNADNA binding affinity, which is within the margin error. It is worth noting that in the full-length TERT, the hRNADNA hybrid makes additional contacts with the TRBD and RT domains (2Mitchell M. Gillis A. Futahashi M. Fujiwara H. Skordalakes E.

Structural basis of telomerase inhibition by the highly specific BIBR1532.Structure. 2015; 23: 1934-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We therefore expect a higher affinity for the hRNADNA in the context of the full-length protein, consistent with what has been previously reported (26Tomlinson C.G. Holien J.K. Mathias J.A. Parker M.W. Bryan T.M. The C-terminal extension of human telomerase reverse transcriptase is necessary for high affinity binding to telomeric DNA.Biochimie. 2016; 128–129: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We then asked how the disease associated mutations affect the activity and processivity of telomerase. To address this question, we performed direct telomerase activity assays. As a source of telomerase, we used lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with the plasmids pcDNA6-hTERT and pBS-U1-hTER overexpressing telomerase. (The plasmids were a gift form Joachim Lingner's laboratory at the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research.) Prior to carrying out the telomerase activity assays, we checked the levels of WT and mutant hTERT in cell lysates. We did so by Western blotting analysis, using a hTERT, specific antibody (abx120550, Abbexa (27Cohen S.B. Reddel R.R. A sensitive direct human telomerase activity assay.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), as described previously in Bryan et al. (6Bryan C. Rice C. Hoffman H. Harkisheimer M. Sweeney M. Skordalakes E. Structural basis of telomerase inhibition by the highly specific BIBR1532.Structure. 2015; 23: 1934-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis showed that all hThumb WT and mutant proteins (R972H, K1050E, V1025F, and N1028W) express at nearly WT levels with subtle differences between them (Fig. 3A). The final activity and processivity of WT and mutant telomerases were adjusted for the subtle differences observed in the protein levels expressed and were quantified as previously described by Latrick and Cech (28Latrick C.M. Cech T.R. POT1-TPP1 enhances telomerase processivity by slowing primer dissociation and aiding translocation.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 924-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (details of activity and processivity quantification can be found in the methods section of the manuscript; supplemental Fig. S2). Depending on the severity of the TERT mutations, some mutant proteins show modest loss of telomerase activity and processivity, whereas others render the enzyme almost inactive (Fig. 3B). Mutations that make direct contacts with the hRNADNA hybrid or are important for the organization of these motifs show the most severe defects in telomerase activity and processivity. These include R972H and R979W of motif E-I and K1050E of motif E-II (Fig. 4, A–C). R972H and K1050E show 2-fold loss of activity and processivity each, relative to the WT telomerase. The severe R979W mutation results in 4-fold loss of activity and 20% of processivity compared with the WT enzyme (Fig. 3, B–D). The TERT mutants C1015R and L1019F, which comprise part of motif E-I, are located in proximity to each other and are buried in the core of the protein. These two TERT mutations have significantly different effects in telomerase activity and processivity. C1015R shows 4-fold loss of activity and 20% loss of processivity relative to the wild type enzyme. In contrast, L1019F is almost 50% active compared with the WT enzyme, whereas its processivity is WT-like (Fig. 3, B–D). The TERT mutations V1025F and N1028H comprise part of the loop that connects motifs E-I and E-II, while V1090M is part of motif EIII and they all form part of the FVYL pocket. These mutant proteins show a variety of changes in activity and processivity when compared with the WT protein. V1025F is 20% active and 70% processive relative to the WT telomerase; N1028H is 40% active, whereas its processivity is almost WT (90%), and V1090M is 80% active and processive when compared with the WT enzyme (Fig. 3, B–D). Interestingly, A1062T shows WT activity and processivity within the margin of error. To better understand the role of the naturally occurring telomerase mutations associated with the bone marrow failure syndromes DKC, AA, and IPF, we solved the structure of human telomerase thumb domain and performed a host of biochemical assays all geared toward understanding how these mutations affect telomerase function. The hThumb structure is structurally conserved to the Tribolium thumb domain (tcThumb) (Fig. 1, D and E), supporting structural conservation across species. The structural similarity between the two proteins allowed us to generated a telomerase model consisting of an overlay between the tcTERT-hRNADNA complex (PDB code 3KYL) and the hThumb domain (Fig. 4A). The overlay places the hThumb motifs E-I and part of motif E-II in the interior cavity of the TERT ring, where the hRNADNA hybrid binds (Fig. 4A). There are three residues within these two motifs implicated in DKC. These include R972H, R979W, and K1050E. The charged side chains of Arg-972 and Arg-979 of motif E-I and Lys-1050 of motif E-II extend toward the center of the TERT ring where the hRNADNA hybrid is located (Fig. 4B). Arg-979 is within coordinating distance of the hRNADNA hybrid. Arg-972 and Lys-1050 are ∼5.5 Å from the nearest nucleic acid residue, which is sufficient for solvent mediated coordination.

However, full understanding of the molecules possessed by this organism that interact with complement C1q, an initiator of the classical complement pathway, remains elusive. In this study, we identified an endopeptidase of S. pyogenes, PepO, as an interacting molecule, and investigated its effects on complement immunity and pathogenesis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance analysis findings revealed that S. pyogenes recombinant PepO bound to human C1q in a concentration-dependent manner under physiological conditions. Sites of inflammation are known to have decreased pH levels, thus the effects of PepO on bacterial evasion from complement immunity was analyzed in a low pH condition. Notably, under low pH conditions, PepO exhibited a higher affinity for C1q as compared with IgG, and PepO inhibited the binding of IgG to C1q. In addition, pepO deletion rendered S. pyogenes more susceptible to the bacteriocidal activity of human serum. Also, observations of the morphological features of the pepO mutant strain (ΔpepO) showed damaged irregular surfaces as compared with the wild-type strain (WT). WT-infected tissues exhibited greater severity and lower complement activity as compared with those infected by ΔpepO in a mouse skin infection model. Furthermore, WT infection resulted in a larger accumulation of C1q than that with ΔpepO.

The human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes is a β-hemolytic Gram-positive bacterium that causes a wide variety of diseases in various anatomical sites. Superficial infection of S. pyogenes generally leads to local suppurative lesions, such as seen in pharyngitis and impetigo cases. Such mucosal and skin infections are occasionally followed by onset of immune sequelae, including acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, S. pyogenes infection can also cause invasive diseases, such as necrotizing fasciitis, cellulitis, bacteremia, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), 2The abbreviations used are: STSSstreptococcal toxic shock syndromeMACmembrane attack complexC1-INHC1 esterase inhibitorSpeBstreptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin BTHYTodd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 0.2% yeast extractPepOendopeptidase OIgGimmunoglobulin GSPRsurface plasmon resonanceCRPC-reactive proteinTLRToll-like receptorANOVAanalysis of varianceSEMscanning electron microscope. with a high mortality rate, which has been a serious problem throughout the world (1.Cunningham M.W.

Host possesses various immune systems such as the complement system, one of the most important components of innate immunity, that contributes to host defense against pathogens, especially in the early stage of infection (4.Sakamoto M. Fujisawa Y. Nishioka K. Physiologic role of the complement system in host defense, disease, and malnutrition.Nutrition. 1998; 14: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recognition of an invading pathogen is the trigger for complement pathway activation, and then each complement factor is activated in a sequential manner with precise control (5.Merle N.S. Church S.E. Fremeaux-Bacchi V. Roumenina L.T. Complement system part I: molecular mechanisms of activation and regulation.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6: 262Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Together with opsonization, complement-mediated direct killing of pathogens is attributable to formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which consists of late complement factors and induces bacteriolysis by pore formation on the surface of bacterial cells. During the course of infection, S. pyogenes also produces virulence factors that are involved in evasion from complement immunity. The serotype determinant M protein, encoded by the emm gene, binds to C4b-binding protein, resulting in inhibition of classical pathway activation. Furthermore, a variety of M protein types enable escape from C3b opsonization by binding to Factor H (6.Thern A. Stenberg L. Dahlbäck B. Lindahl G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition, the streptococcal C5a peptidase ScpA has been found to be associated with evasion from bacterial clearance (9.Ji Y. McLandsborough L. Kondagunta A. Cleary P.P. C5a peptidase alters clearance and trafficking of group A streptococci by infected mice.Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 503-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modulation of activation of the complement cascade is finely tuned by both activating and inhibitory functions. Consequently, stoichiometric imbalance of complement components, such as excess consumption or proteolysis of each component, allows discordant regulation of the complement cascade. In fact, deficiencies of several complement factors render the host more susceptible to bacterial infections (10.Skattum L. van Deuren M. van der Poll T. Truedsson L. Complement deficiency states and associated infections.Mol. Immunol. 2011; 48: 1643-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In other studies, the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), a complement regulating factor that inactivates the C1 complex, has been utilized as a therapeutic agent for sepsis (11.Igonin A.A. Protsenko D.N. Galstyan G.M. Vlasenko A.V. Khachatryan N.N. Nekhaev I.V. Shlyapnikov S.A. Lazareva N.B. Herscu P.

Li J. Davis 3rd., A.E. C1 inhibitor-mediated protection from sepsis.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 3966-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In our previous examination, we focused on the similarity of symptoms between STSS and C1-INH deficiency, and noted that a decrease in C1-INH level caused by S. pyogenes infection is associated with the pathogenesis (13.Brosnahan A.J. Schlievert P.M. Gram-positive bacterial superantigen outside-in signaling causes toxic shock syndrome.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 4649-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14.Castelli R.

Immunotoxicol. 2013; 35: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In that study, we also demonstrated that streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB), a representative cysteine protease from S. pyogenes, cleaves C1-INH and complement factors, including C3 and late complement factors, allowing bacterial evasion from complement-mediated killing. It is considered likely that SpeB-mediated degradation of C1-INH leads to overconsumption of complement factors downstream of the cascade. Furthermore, SpeB also degrades C2, C4, and C3b, as well as late complement factors, thereby inhibiting MAC formation (15.Honda-Ogawa M. Ogawa T. Terao Y. Sumitomo T. Nakata M. Ikebe K. Maeda Y. Kawabata S. Cysteine proteinase from Streptococcus pyogenes enables evasion of innate immunity via degradation of complement factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 15854-15864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, we consider that an imbalanced consumption of complement factors caused by SpeB enables S. pyogenes to evade host innate immune responses. Strains with a relatively low level of SpeB activity have been reported to efficiently interrupt complement immunity, thus we speculate that S. pyogenes is able to hamper the classical pathway in an SpeB-independent manner. Recently, endopeptidase O (PepO) secreted from Streptococcus pneumoniae has been shown to bind to C1q and affect opsonophagocytosis (16.Agarwal V. Sroka M. Fulde M. Bergmann S. Riesbeck K. Blom A.M. Binding of Streptococcus pneumoniae endopeptidase O (PepO) to complement component C1q modulates the complement attack and promotes host cell adherence.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 15833-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). S. pyogenes possesses a homologue with a 68% homology to S. pneumoniae PepO on the amino acid level. Although it was reported that cytoplasmic S. pyogenes PepO disrupts quorum sensing, it is unclear whether that is also secreted or has biological functions (17.Wilkening R.V. Chang J.C. Federle M.J. PepO, a CovRS-controlled endopeptidase, disrupts Streptococcus pyogenes quorum sensing.Mol. Microbiol. 2016; 99: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the interaction between S. pyogenes PepO and human C1q, and investigated whether PepO is involved in evasion from complement-mediated immunity and pathogenesis. To examine the subcellular localization of PepO, we prepared culture supernatant, cell wall, and cytoplasmic fractions from batch cultures of S. pyogenes clinical isolates obtained from patients with invasive and non-invasive diseases, as well as a laboratory strain (Table 1), then subjected them to Western blot analysis using anti-PepO antiserum. The majority of strains secreted PepO that was detected as a 71.2-kDa band with anti-PepO antiserum into the culture supernatants (Fig. 1A), whereas it was scarcely detected in cell wall fractions (data not shown). Also, PepO was detected in the cytoplasmic fractions of all tested strains (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, PepO produced by TW3358 exhibited different band patterns in the culture supernatant and cytoplasmic fractions as compared with the other strains. In addition, the expression level of PepO was not related to disease severity, and there was no obvious correlation between PepO production and the emm type of the S. pyogenes strains (Fig. 1, A and B).TABLE 1Streptococcal strains used in this studyemm typeStrainOriginemm1SSI-9STSSemm1SF370Wound infectionemm2NIH2STSSemm2SE1013Pharyngitisemm3SSI-1STSSemm3TW3358Pharyngitisemm4TW3392Pharyngitisemm4TW3398Pharyngitisemm6JRS4Laboratory strainemm6SE1303Pharyngitisemm12NY-5Scarlet feveremm12TW3337Pharyngitisemm18T18Rheumatic feveremm18TW3338Pharyngitisemm22NIH32STSSemm22TW3340Pharyngitisemm28NIH35STSSemm28TW3339Pharyngitisemm49CS101Impetigoemm49NZ131Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis Open table in a new tab In a previous study, we found that SpeB has an ability to interrupt the host complement system via degradation of various host complement component factors. Despite low SpeB production, the SSI-1 strain is able to avoid complement immunity, indicating that alternative factors may be involved in the evasion mechanism (15.Honda-Ogawa M. Ogawa T. Terao Y. Sumitomo T. Nakata M. Ikebe K. Maeda Y. Kawabata S. Cysteine proteinase from Streptococcus pyogenes enables evasion of innate immunity via degradation of complement factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 15854-15864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, C1q was not cleaved by SpeB (data not shown). To examine the potential involvement of PepO in complement system dysfunction, the SSI-1 strain was used as the parental strain in the following experiments. S. pneumoniae PepO has been shown to bind to human complement factor C1q, which leads to bacterial evasion from complement immunity via a classical pathway (16.Agarwal V. Sroka M. Fulde M. Bergmann S. Riesbeck K. Blom A.M. Binding of Streptococcus pneumoniae endopeptidase O (PepO) to complement component C1q modulates the complement attack and promotes host cell adherence.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 15833-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the direct interaction between S. pyogenes PepO and human C1q by SPR analysis at pH 7.4 (Fig. 2A and Table 2). Surprisingly, C1q was found to bind to rPepO with high affinity (KD = 1.09 × 10−9 m), which is comparable with the affinity of C1q for IgG (KD = 2.45 × 10−9 m)(Table 2). Next, rPepO was incubated with C1q following serial dilution with binding buffer containing a physiological concentration of NaCl (150 mm), then, binding of C1q to PepO was determined by ELISA (Fig. 2B). Our ELISA results showed that rPepO exhibited a lower level of binding activity to C1q as compared with that of human IgG, yet C1q was shown to bind to rPepO in a concentration-dependent manner, similar to IgG. On the other hand, BSA showed little or no capacity for binding with C1q. Although PepO released from S. pyogenes exhibits a lower capacity to bind to human C1q as compared with IgG, PepO possesses a high affinity for C1q, similar to the affinity of IgG for C1q under physiological conditions.TABLE 2Kinetics and affinity of human C1q for rPepO and IgGLigandskakdKDm−1s−1s−1mPepO3.37 × 1063.69 × 10−31.09 × 10−9IgG1.23 × 1063.01 × 10−32.45 × 10−9 Open table in a new tab C1q consists of both collagen-like stalk and globular head domains (18.Kishore U. Reid K.B. C1q: structure, function, and receptors.Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). At the beginning of the classical complement pathway, an antigen-antibody complex binds to the C-terminal globular head of C1q via lysine residues in the Fc region of IgG in an electrostatic manner. Accordingly, it has been shown that the interaction of IgG to C1q is inhibited under conditions that include high concentrations of NaCl (19.Lin T.Y. Fletcher D.S. Interaction of human Clq with insoluble immunoglobulin aggregates.Immunochemistry. 1978; 15: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To examine whether electrostatic interaction is involved in the binding of PepO with C1q, ELISA was performed in the presence of various concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 3A). We found that rPepO bound to C1q, peaking at 37.5 mm NaCl, and then the binding capacity was decreased in an NaCl concentration-dependent manner, with a similar tendency observed in regard to the binding of IgG to C1q. This result indicated that the association of PepO with C1q is achieved by electrostatic interaction. However, unlike IgG, the binding of PepO to C1q was strongly inhibited by higher concentrations of NaCl. It is known that pH levels are decreased in inflamed sites (20.Lardner A. The effects of extracellular pH on immune function.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 69: 522-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of pH level on the binding of PepO to C1q with phosphate buffer, the pH of which ranges from 4.6 to 9 as binding buffer for use with ELISA (Fig. 3B). rPepO at less than pH 7.0 showed a significantly higher affinity for C1q as compared with that at pH 7.4, 8.0, and 9.0 (Fig. 3B, left). On the other hand, lower pH levels seemed to have an inhibitory effect on the affinity of IgG for C1q (Fig. 3B, right). The pH level in inflamed tissues is substantially reduced to a range of 5.0–6.0 (20.Lardner A. The effects of extracellular pH on immune function.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 69: 522-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Steen K.H. Steen A.E. Reeh P.W.

Biology of inflammation; chemical mediators and cellular injury.Science. 1956; 123: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus the binding activities of PepO and IgG to C1q at pH 5.0 were further examined using ELISA. As expected, the binding of PepO to C1q showed a higher affinity, as compared with that of IgG at pH 5.0 (Fig. 3C). We speculated that PepO highly exerts its activity in low pH conditions. To examine whether PepO and IgG bind to C1q in a mutually antagonistic manner under acidic conditions, immobilized rPepO was incubated with C1q in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of human IgG as a competitor at pH 5.0. IgG did not significantly inhibit the binding of rPepO to C1q (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, immobilized human IgG showed a lower affinity with C1q in the presence of higher concentrations of rPepO at pH 5.0 (Fig. 4B). Taken together, our results demonstrated that PepO possesses an ability to suppress the binding of human IgG to C1q in an acidic pH condition. Complement C1q is an initiator of the classical pathway, indicating the possibility that PepO disturbs the complement cascade via binding to C1q. Because it was previously reported that complement factors infiltrate from blood vessels to inflamed tissues (23.auf dem Keller U. Prudova A. Eckhard U. Fingleton B. Overall C.M. Systems-level analysis of proteolytic events in increased vascular permeability and complement activation in skin inflammation.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: rs2Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we examined the survival of S. pyogenes WT and pepO deletion mutant (ΔpepO) strains when grown in normal and complement-inactivated human serum at pH 5.0. As shown in Fig. 5A, when incubated in normal serum, the WT strain exhibited a significantly higher growth rate as compared with the ΔpepO strain. Although there was no significant difference between normal and complement-inactivated serum in regard to the survival rate of WT, the growth rate of the ΔpepO strain incubated in complement-inactivated serum was significantly higher as compared with that in normal serum. The survival rates of bacteria incubated in normal and complement-inactivated serum with 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 5.0 were similar to the rate of bacterial survival in 10 mm phosphate buffer (data not shown). We also examined the survival rates of these strains in serum and complement-inactivated serum at pH 6.0 and 7.0. WT showed significantly higher growth rate in normal serum than ΔpepO at pH 6.0, whereas the growth of ΔpepO in complement-inactivated serum was not significantly high as compared with the growth of that strain in normal serum (Fig. 5B). In addition, the survival rate of WT at pH 7.0 was equivalent to that of ΔpepO (Fig. 5C). The effect of PepO for survival of S. pyogenes in serum was decreased under higher pH conditions. These results indicated that PepO renders S. pyogenes more resistant to the bacteriostatic activity of human serum under lower pH conditions. To examine the effect of PepO on bacteriolysis, the bacterial strains were incubated with normal or complement-inactivated human serum at pH 5.0 in 10 mm phosphate buffer, then their surfaces were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Fig. 5D). Following 30 min of incubation in normal serum, the ΔpepO strain displayed damaged bacterial surfaces as compared with non-treated ΔpepO cells. Although the WT also showed irregular surfaces after growth in normal serum as compared with the non-treated WT cells, the ΔpepO grown in normal serum showed more severe morphological changes. In contrast, when grown in inactivated serum, both strains exhibited only slightly irregular bacterial surfaces as compared with when grown in normal serum. When 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 5.0 was added to normal serum, both the WT and ΔpepO strains showed the same tendency as bacteria incubated in 10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 5.0 (data not shown). These findings suggest that human serum-induced morphological changes of the bacterial surface under a low pH condition are inhibited by PepO. A mouse skin infection model was used to investigate the influence of PepO on S. pyogenes virulence in vivo. The WT strain formed significantly larger lesions as compared with those formed in mice infected with the ΔpepO strain until 3 days after infection (Fig. 6, A and B). Therefore, lesions at 4 days postinfection exhibited a size similar to those seen at 3 days, and lesions formed by both strains began to show a decrease in size at 5 days (data not shown). Furthermore, the complement activity in infected tissues was analyzed (Fig. 6C). Lesions formed following infection with WT exhibited lower complement activity as compared with that with ΔpepO. To verify the effect of the interaction between PepO and C1q on S. pyogenes virulence, C1q levels in the lesions were semiquantified. Those levels were increased in skin lesions of mice infected with WT as compared with those infected with the ΔpepO strain (Fig. 6D). These findings indicate that the PepO-C1q interaction participates in development of inflammatory lesions via suppression of complement activity. Endopeptidase O, a zinc metalloendopeptidase, belongs to the M13 peptidase family (24.Oetjen J. Fives-Taylor P. Froeliger E. Characterization of a streptococcal endopeptidase with homology to human endothelin-converting enzyme.Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A number of bacterial species, including Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Streptococcus parasanguis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactococcus helveticus, possess its homologue and the active sites of these metalloproteases are all conserved. At the time of writing, the multifaceted functions of S. pneumoniae PepO have received the most attention in research investigations. Pneumococcal PepO binds to human plasminogen and fibronectin, thus facilitating bacterial internalization into host cells and evasion from innate immunity (25.Agarwal V. Kuchipudi A. Fulde M. Riesbeck K. Bergmann S. Blom A.M. Streptococcus pneumoniae endopeptidase O (PepO) is a multifunctional plasminogen- and fibronectin-binding protein, facilitating evasion of innate immunity and invasion of host cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 6849-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Also, in vivo analysis using a mouse model revealed that S. pneumoniae PepO induces a strong innate immune response via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 signaling pathways (26.Zhang H. Kang L. Yao H. He Y. Wang X. Xu W. Song Z. Yin Y. Zhang X. Streptococcus pneumoniae endopeptidase O (PepO) elicits a strong innate immune response in mice via TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathways.Front. Cell Infect. Microbiol. 2016; 6: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, secretory PepO of S. pneumoniae has an affinity to human C1q, thereby inhibiting C3b opsonization (16.Agarwal V. Sroka M. Fulde M. Bergmann S. Riesbeck K. Blom A.M. Binding of Streptococcus pneumoniae endopeptidase O (PepO) to complement component C1q modulates the complement attack and promotes host cell adherence.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 15833-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the other hand, surface-associated PepO contributes to bacterial adherence to host cells via its interaction with C1q. The present results revealed that PepO produced by S. pyogenes is an extracellular protein and involved in complement evasion via binding to C1q. In addition, there is a possibility that S. pyogenes-produced PepO also possesses an immunomodulatory function or host cell adhesion activity, as previously reported for pneumococcal PepO. The pepO gene is ubiquitously conserved in S. pyogenes strains. There is no typical signal sequence in S. pyogenes PepO, thus PepO is accordingly speculated to be a cytoplasmic protein. However, our results revealed that S. pyogenes PepO localizes not only in cytoplasm but also in culture supernatant, whereas it was scarcely detected in cell wall fractions, unlike S. pneumoniae PepO (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition to its previously reported functions, our findings suggest that PepO is multifunctional in both cytoplasm and the extracellular milieu, similar to the properties of GAPDH and enolase, which lack a signal sequence but are found in culture supernatant (27.Bergmann S. Rohde M. Chhatwal G.S. Hammerschmidt S. α-Enolase of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a plasmin(ogen)-binding protein displayed on the bacterial cell surface.Mol.

Group A Streptococcus exploits human plasminogen for bacterial translocation across epithelial barrier via tricellular tight junctions.Sci. Rep. 2016; 7: 20069Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The present study provides clues about the variable ability of S. pyogenes strains to express and secrete PepO. On the other hand, the relationships among disease severity, emm type, and PepO localization were not revealed, and future studies of the secretion mechanism and its contribution to virulence are required. C1q consists of three subunits, each of which possesses globular head and collagen-like domains. For C1q-IgG interaction, acidic and basic amino residues of the IgG and C1q globular head domains constitute salt bridges that provide connection (32.Gaboriaud C. Juanhuix J. Gruez A. Lacroix M. Darnault C. Pignol D. Verger D. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Arlaud G.J. The crystal structure of the globular head of complement protein C1q provides a basis for its versatile recognition properties.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46974-46982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These ionic bonds indicate that the interaction of IgG with C1q is inhibited under a high salt concentration condition. Our findings suggested that the ionic bond between acidic and basic amino acid residues is also involved in the association of PepO with C1q. In addition, the effect of PepO to inhibit the association of IgG with C1q (Fig. 4B) indicates the possibility that PepO and IgG share either the same or proximate site for C1q binding. On the other hand, a previous study noted that a high pH level of ∼8.5 enhances the binding of IgG to C1q (33.Kaul M. Loos"
https://openalex.org/W2585384292,"The immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) are a family of proteins that are induced by interferon (IFN)-γ and play pivotal roles in immune and inflammatory responses. IRGs ostensibly function as dynamin-like proteins that bind to intracellular membranes and promote remodeling and trafficking of those membranes. Prior studies have shown that loss of Irgm1 in mice leads to increased lethality to bacterial infections as well as enhanced inflammation to non-infectious stimuli; however, the mechanisms underlying these phenotypes are unclear. In the studies reported here, we found that uninfected Irgm1-deficient mice displayed high levels of serum cytokines typifying profound autoinflammation. Similar increases in cytokine production were also seen in cultured, IFN-γ-primed macrophages that lacked Irgm1. A series of metabolic studies indicated that the enhanced cytokine production was associated with marked metabolic changes in the Irgm1-deficient macrophages, including increased glycolysis and an accumulation of long chain acylcarnitines. Cells were exposed to the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose, or fatty acid synthase inhibitors to perturb the metabolic alterations, which resulted in dampening of the excessive cytokine production. These results suggest that Irgm1 deficiency drives metabolic dysfunction in macrophages in a manner that is cell-autonomous and independent of infectious triggers. This may be a significant contributor to excessive inflammation seen in Irgm1-deficient mice in different contexts."

ENaC is a trimer of three homologous subunits (α, β, and γ). We previously reported that cytoplasmic residues on the β (βCys-43 and βCys-557) and γ (γCys-33 and γCys-41) subunits are palmitoylated. Mutation of Cys that blocked ENaC palmitoylation also reduced channel open probability. Furthermore, γ subunit palmitoylation had a dominant role over β subunit palmitoylation in regulating ENaC. To determine which palmitoyltransferases (termed DHHCs) regulate the channel, mouse ENaCs were co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with each of the 23 mouse DHHCs. ENaC activity was significantly increased by DHHCs 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14. ENaC activation by DHHCs was lost when γ subunit palmitoylation sites were mutated, whereas DHHCs 1, 2, and 14 still activated ENaC lacking β subunit palmitoylation sites. β subunit palmitoylation was increased by ENaC co-expression with DHHC 7. Both wild type ENaC and channels lacking β and γ palmitoylation sites co-immunoprecipitated with the five activating DHHCs, suggesting that ENaC forms a complex with multiple DHHCs. RT-PCR revealed that transcripts for the five activating DHHCs were present in cultured mCCDcl1 cells, and DHHC 3 was expressed in aquaporin 2-positive principal cells of mouse aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron where ENaC is localized.

https://openalex.org/W2585982412,"Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase γ (Pol γ) is the only polymerase known to replicate the mitochondrial genome. The Pol γ holoenzyme consists of the p140 catalytic subunit (POLG) and the p55 homodimeric accessory subunit (POLG2), which enhances binding of Pol γ to DNA and promotes processivity of the holoenzyme. Mutations within POLG impede maintenance of mtDNA and cause mitochondrial diseases. Two common POLG mutations usually found in cis in patients primarily with progressive external ophthalmoplegia generate T251I and P587L amino acid substitutions. To determine whether T251I or P587L is the primary pathogenic allele or whether both substitutions are required to cause disease, we overproduced and purified WT, T251I, P587L, and T251I + P587L double variant forms of recombinant Pol γ. Biochemical characterization of these variants revealed impaired DNA binding affinity, reduced thermostability, diminished exonuclease activity, defective catalytic activity, and compromised DNA processivity, even in the presence of the p55 accessory subunit. However, physical association with p55 was unperturbed, suggesting intersubunit affinities similar to WT. Notably, although the single mutants were similarly impaired, a dramatic synergistic effect was found for the double mutant across all parameters. In conclusion, our analyses suggest that individually both T251I and P587L substitutions functionally impair Pol γ, with greater pathogenicity predicted for the single P587L variant.

In general, all tissues/organs are susceptible, but tissues with a large oxygen consumption, such as skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, are particularly vulnerable. Further, the severity of phenotypic expression and the age at which the disease first presents itself can be unpredictable. Among unrelated families harboring two mutant POLG alleles, the most common mutations are A467T (∼31%), G848S (∼10%), and W748S (∼8%), followed by in cis T251I + P587L (∼6%) (15.Tang S. Wang J.

With the exception of T251I + P587L, all have been previously characterized biochemically to provide insight into the consequence and mechanism of these Pol γ mutations. Located in the linker region between the exonuclease and polymerase domains of Pol γ, the A467T mutation is associated with PEO, Alpers, and ANS. The purified recombinant A467T Pol γ protein possesses diminished DNA polymerase activity (4% of the wild type) and disrupted interaction with the p55 accessory subunit (16.Chan S.S.L. Longley M.J.

The recombinant W748S Pol γ exhibits low DNA polymerase activity, processivity, and affinity for DNA (18.Chan S.S.L. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C.

The main clinical presentation is PEO, with or without ptosis, and secondary clinical features include ataxia, myopathy, epilepsy, neuropathy, and hepatic diseases. Age of onset is variable, and disease is equally distributed between the sexes. Alpers and myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum disorders have been diagnosed in infancy, although infrequently (20.Wong L.J.

PolyPhen-2, a publicly available computer algorithm that predicts the impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a protein, projected P587L as probably damaging and T251I as benign. This may be due in part to the higher phylogenetic conservation of P587L as compared with T251I (Fig. 1B) and the presence of two known pathogenic mutations, G588D and P589L, near P587L (36.Farnum G.A.

Nonetheless, because both mutations are found in almost all clinical cases, definitive assignment of pathogenicity to T251I or P587L and/or possible synergistic effects has remained uncertain until now. In this work, we biochemically characterized the individual (WT, T251I, and P587L) and combination (T251I + P587L) human Pol γ variants along several parameters, including intrinsic affinity for double-stranded DNA, thermostability, steady-state kinetics analysis of polymerase and exonuclease activities, physical association with the p55 accessory subunit, and processivity of DNA synthesis. Our results demonstrate not only functional impairment of each of the individual variants on Pol γ, but a dramatic synergistic effect, thus exposing the underlying molecular mechanism. To study the biochemical properties of the individual T251I and P587L Pol γ variants and the combination variant in comparison with WT, we created each substitution employing site-directed mutagenesis, overexpressed the recombinant proteins in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, and purified each to homogeneity following established purification processes (37.Longley M.J.

Immunoblot analysis confirmed the identity of each full-length variant. The overall yields of WT and each individual variant were equivalent but were less than previously reported for the exonuclease-deficient WT Pol γ (37.Longley M.J. Ropp P.A. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C.

However, the yield of the T251I + P587L combination variant was significantly less, although predictable chromatographic behavior during purification and SDS-PAGE analysis showed purity and structural integrity of all enzymes (data not shown). Mutations in the Pol γ polymerase domain and linker region have resulted in impaired binding to DNA (17.Kasiviswanathan R. Longley M.J. Chan S.S. Copeland W.C.

Various concentrations of each enzyme were incubated with a fluorescently labeled 54-bp, double-stranded, forked oligonucleotide substrate, and the mixtures were resolved by native PAGE to separate the protein-DNA complex from free DNA (Fig. 2, A–D). Of note are the two distinct shifted species for bound DNA in all variants with the exception of T251I + P587L. Each species is dependent on the concentration of the enzyme and may reflect two areas of DNA binding. The apparent dissociation constant, Kd(DNA), for each variant was calculated by fitting the fraction of DNA bound as a function of enzyme concentration to a quadratic equation by non-linear regression analysis with compensation for ligand depletion (Fig. 2E) (40.Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Application of fluorescence energy transfer and polarization to monitor Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein and lac promoter interaction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Both WT and T251I had strong affinities for DNA at 72.5 ± 10.7 and 60.5 ± 12.2 nm, respectively (Fig. 2F). P587L affinity for DNA was moderately, yet significantly, compromised with a 2-fold reduction as compared with WT (138.9 ± 10.1 nm). Similarly, the binding affinity of T251I + P587L for DNA was even more impaired with a ∼3-fold reduction from WT (200.5 ± 16.3 nm) (Fig. 2F). Pol γ activities are extremely sensitive to heat inactivation, particularly in the absence of a DNA substrate (16.Chan S.S.L. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C.

Although intrinsic protein stability of the α-helices within Pol γ variants has been gauged previously by circular dichroism spectroscopy (17.Kasiviswanathan R. Longley M.J. Chan S.S. Copeland W.C.

Consequently, we heat-inactivated each holoenzyme variant (1 nm p140 + 2 nm p55) by incubation at 37 °C at several time points between 0 and 45 min and then measured reverse transcriptase activity in 10-min reactions using poly(rA)·oligo(dT)12–18 as the primer-template (see “Experimental Procedures”). WT was inactivated with a half-life of 7.5 ± 0.8 min (Fig. 3, A and B). T251I, P587L, and T251I + P587L each had significantly lower half-lives at 5.7 ± 0.4, 3.6 ± 0.2, and 2.1 ± 0.2 min, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). The significant reduction in half-life for the Pol γ variants indicates that these amino acid substitutions promote a higher probability of losing activity through heat-induced conformational change that causes unrecoverable loss of activity, and this effect is additive for the combination mutant. Because one of the mutations resides within the exonuclease domain, exonuclease activity was determined by monitoring degradation of the 5′-end-labeled 35-mer single-stranded M13 DNA primer by 12% urea-PAGE denaturing gel (see “Experimental Procedures”). The rate of excising 3′-primer termini for each enzyme was determined by plotting the loss of substrate versus time at points along a 3-min reaction. Final enzyme concentrations were experimentally determined to be within the linear range of the reaction for each variant. A representative gel revealing nucleotide excision events with the plot of exonuclease product formed as a function of time for the Pol γ variants is shown (Fig. 4, A–E). The turnover number (kexo) for WT exonuclease activity was 20.9 ± 1.0 min−1 (Fig. 4F). The T251I substitution in the exonuclease domain of Pol γ resulted in a 7.2-fold reduction (2.9 ± 0.3 min−1) in exonuclease activity. Although P587L is in the linker region, kexo for P587L was reduced 3.4-fold (6.2 ± 0.4 min−1). Excision by the double mutant form was severely impaired by 13.1-fold (1.6 ± 0.4 min−1), suggesting synergistic defects for the T251I + P587L variant (Fig. 4F). Steady-state kinetic measurements for the Pol γ variants in the presence of p55 were determined in a standard DNA synthesis assay utilizing the homopolymeric primer-template substrate poly(dA)·oligo(dT)12–18 with Mg2+ as cofactor and with varying concentrations of dTTP. The rate of dTTP incorporated over time was used to calculate Km(dTTP) and kcat by fitting the data to the steady-state M"

Strategies to engineer more efficient plant Rubiscos have been hampered by evolutionary constraints, prompting interest in Rubisco isoforms from non-photosynthetic organisms. The methanogenic archaeon Methanococcoides burtonii contains a Rubisco isoform that functions to scavenge the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) by-product of purine/pyrimidine metabolism. The crystal structure of M. burtonii Rubisco (MbR) presented here at 2.6 Å resolution is composed of catalytic large subunits (LSu) assembled into pentamers of dimers, (L2)5, and differs from Rubiscos from higher plants where LSus are glued together by small subunits (SSu) into hexadecameric L8S8 enzymes. MbR contains a unique 29-amino acid insertion near the C terminus, which folds as a separate domain in the structure. This domain, which is visualized for the first time in this study, is located in a similar position to SSus in L8S8 enzymes between LSus of adjacent L2 dimers, where negatively charged residues coordinate around a Mg2+ ion in a fashion that suggests this domain may be important for the assembly process. The Rubisco assembly domain is thus an inbuilt SSu mimic that concentrates L2 dimers. MbR assembly is ligand-stimulated, and we show that only 6-carbon molecules with a particular stereochemistry at the C3 carbon can induce oligomerization. Based on MbR structure, subunit arrangement, sequence, phylogenetic distribution, and function, MbR and a subset of Rubiscos from the Methanosarcinales order are proposed to belong to a new Rubisco subgroup, named form IIIB.

In the majority of organisms harboring Rubisco, this is the initial and rate-limiting reaction in the reductive pentose phosphate cycle of photosynthesis leading to the incorporation of CO2 into the biosphere. Rubisco exhibits a slow CO2 fixation rate and poorly discriminates between substrate CO2 and O2. Fixation of O2 produces the toxic compound 2-phosphoglycolate whose recycling consumes energy and releases fixed CO2. Discerning between CO2 and O2 at the molecular level is fundamentally a difficult task and was unnecessary for ancestral Rubisco that arose under relatively sparse atmospheric O2 concentrations. Rubisco's catalytic inefficiencies often limit plant growth and resource-use-efficiency (1.Andersson I. Catalysis and regulation in Rubisco.J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59: 1555-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 2.Long S.P. Zhu X.-G. Naidu S.L. Ort D.R. Can improvement in photosynthesis increase crop yields?.Plant Cell Environ. 2006; 29: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). However, strategies to engineer more efficient plant Rubiscos have been thwarted by an inherent catalytic trade-off between turnover and specificity suggesting that higher plant Rubisco catalysis may have reached an evolutionary maximum (3.Tcherkez G.G. Farquhar G.D. Andrews T.J. Despite slow catalysis and confused substrate specificity, all ribulose bisphosphate carboxylases may be nearly perfectly optimized.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7246-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Catalytic improvements may be further complicated by a heavy reliance on co-evolved molecular partners (4.Durão P. Aigner H. Nagy P. Mueller-Cajar O. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Opposing effects of folding and assembly chaperones on evolvability of Rubisco.Nat. Chem.

Catalysis in Rubisco occurs at the interface of two 50–52-kDa large subunits (LSu). This L2 dimer is the functional unit and contains two active sites. Form II (bacterial) and form III (archaeal) Rubiscos exist as such L2 dimers or as oligomers of dimers, (L2)n. In form I (higher plant, cyanobacterial, algal, and most proteobacterial) Rubiscos, four L2 dimers are assembled around a 4-fold axis by two tetramers of ∼15-kDa small subunits (SSu) that cap each end of the (L2)4 barrel. These ∼550-kDa hexadecameric L8S8 Rubiscos exhibit far superior catalytic efficiency than their (L2)n counterparts. The SSu is thought to have evolved before the divergence of proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, but after the transfer of an archaeal form III Rubisco to eubacteria (7.Tabita F.R. Hanson T.E. Li H. Satagopan S. Singh J. Chan S. Function, structure, and evolution of the RubisCO-like proteins and their RubisCO homologs.Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2871-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Form III Rubiscos do not contribute to photosynthetic processes in vivo, but because the catalytic mechanism is conserved, they can functionally substitute for photosynthetic Rubiscos (9.Finn M.W.

M. burtonii Rubisco (MbR) has many intriguing characteristics. Five L2 dimers assemble into a rare (L2)5 structure observed exclusively in thermostable archaeal Rubiscos (13.Kitano K. Maeda N.

Chem. 2009; 284: 33876-33882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MbR contains a unique 26–30-amino acid insertion between α6 and β7 at the bottom of the βα-barrel (7.Tabita F.R. Hanson T.E. Li H. Satagopan S. Singh J. Chan S.

Taming the Wild RubisCO: Explorations in Functional Metagenomics. The Ohio State University, Columbus2012Google Scholar). MbR exhibits higher sequence homology to proteobacterial form II Rubiscos, and on this basis it has been classified as a form II Rubisco (7.Tabita F.R. Hanson T.E. Li H. Satagopan S. Singh J. Chan S. Function, structure, and evolution of the RubisCO-like proteins and their RubisCO homologs.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 576-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), despite being of archaeal origin and exhibiting archaeon-like decameric assembly. A lack of structural information hinders MbR classification and prevents mechanistic insights into the role of the bonus sequence in substrate-induced oligomerization. Here, we describe the crystal structure of (L2)5 MbR, and by comparing MbR sequence and structure elements with other Rubisco lineages, we propose a re-evaluation of the current Rubisco classification system, establishing a new Rubisco group, form IIIB, which contains a subset of methanogenic archaeal Rubiscos with well defined sequence and phylogenetic characteristics. Biochemical approaches complement 3D structural analyses to describe the role of the unique bonus sequence as an inbuilt Rubisco SSu. The MbR model presented here is essentially complete. Of the 474 residues, amino acids 1–473 could be modeled with the exception of residue 473 in chain C and residue 1 in chain E, which were not included in the model because of weak supporting electron density. The completeness of the MbR model is thus higher than previous structures of form II or form III Rubisco enzymes, including the Rhodopseudomonas palustris search model (Table 1). The MbR asymmetric unit contains five LSus. Applying the crystallographic symmetry results in the L10 biological unit (Fig. 1A) consistent with previous biochemical observations (10.Alonso H.

S1 and S2 for an explanation of the naming conventions for Rubisco secondary structure). The MbR structure (half of the biological unit) contains 10 Mg2+ ions, 5 Cl− ions, and 294 water molecules. As expected, Mg2+ binds to the active site (5 per half-L10 decamer), stabilizing the carbamate formed at the active site lysine (16.Lorimer G.H. Badger M.R. Andrews T.J. The activation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase by carbon dioxide and magnesium ions. Equilibria, kinetics, a suggested mechanism, and physiological implications.Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). A second binding site for Mg2+ was also inferred from difference electron density at the interface of the L2 dimers (two Mg2+ per interface and 5 per half-L10 decamer). This Mg2+ ion is coordinated by a structural motif unique to MbR, which adopts a loop-helix-loop conformation (Fig. 1B). The motif, which forms a separate domain, is encoded by a C-terminal 29-amino acid insertion in MbR (residues 361–389) and corresponds to a β-hairpin motif predicted from sequence data (17.Tabita F.R. Hanson T.E. Satagopan S. Witte B.H. Kreel N.E. Phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships of RubisCO and the RubisCO-like proteins and the functional lessons provided by diverse molecular forms.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2008; 363: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The helix of the motif (named αJ) is located between helix α6 and strand β7 of the βα-barrel (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). A search using the Dali server (18.Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3051) Google Scholar) did not identify structures that exhibit structural similarity to this new motif. Although the search model was at the lower size limit for the Dali server, these results suggest that the structure of this motif is unique. Because of its strategic location and its clear functional role (see below), we named it the Rubisco assembly domain (RAD). The Mg2+ ion is ligated by oxygen donor atoms provided by the side chains of Asp-366 and Asp-368 located at the N-terminal end of the RAD helix αJ (supplemental Fig. S1) and Glu-179 and Asp-183 located in helix α1 of the βα-barrel in the LSu of the neighboring L2 dimer (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). A solvent molecule donates a further oxygen atom such that the lock site exhibits near-octahedral coordination geometry with a coordination number of 6 as expected for a magnesium ion (Fig. 1C) (19.Harding M.M. Geometry of metal-ligand interactions in proteins.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Whereas the carboxylates of Glu-179 and Asp-368 are monodentate, the carboxylates of Asp-183 and Asp-366 tend toward bidentate in the equatorial plane; it is likely that at least one is bidentate at any one instant. The coordination of ligands to the Mg2+ ion from two adjacent subunits potentially distorts the coordination sphere, which may be considered somewhat between octahedral and trigonal bipyramidal (20.Zheng H. Chordia M.D. Cooper D.R. Chruszcz M. Müller P. Sheldrick G.M. Minor W. Validation of metal-binding sites in macromolecular structures with the CheckMyMetal web server.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 156-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The minor deviations in geometry observed may be a result of the limited resolution or caused by crystal packing forces. However, more likely, the location at the interface between two LSus is the cause of the deviation from ideal magnesium coordination geometry. In addition to the Mg2+ lock site, the interaction surface between the RAD and the neighboring dimer is formed between residues 385 and 389 in the loop region of the RAD and residues in helices α1 and α2 in a neighboring LSu. This interface is likely stabilized by (i) salt bridges between Asp-385 and Lys-219 and Lys-222 in helix α2 and (ii) hydrogen bonding between the side chains of RAD residue Ser-387 and residue Glu-215 in helix α2. Aside from its role as a ligand to the lock site Mg2+ ion, residue Glu-179 is also engaged in hydrogen bonding to residues Trp-388 and Arg-389 of the RAD (Fig. 1D). The modeling of solvent and metal ions at the current resolution (2.6 Å) is non-trivial. We also considered Na+ (20.Zheng H. Chordia M.D. Cooper D.R. Chruszcz M. Müller P. Sheldrick G.M. Minor W.

Protoc. 2014; 9: 156-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), which was present during crystallization, but favor Mg2+ on the grounds of geometry and chemistry. M. burtonii has a magnesium transporter, CorA, for active uptake of Mg2+ (21.Allen M.A. Lauro F.M. Williams T.J. Burg D. Siddiqui K.S. De Francisci D. Chong K.W. Pilak O. Chew H.H. De Maere M.Z.

Gottlieb E. Kucharski L.M. Maguire M.E. Functional similarity between archaeal and bacterial CorA magnesium transporters.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2788-2791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it requires greater than 0.01 m MgSO4 or MgCl2 for growth. The MbR RAD is located between neighboring L2 dimers in a similar position as the SSu in L8S8 Rubiscos (Fig. 1A). This indicates that it may play a similar role to the SSu, concentrating LSu dimers. This type of concentrating structure is lacking in the archaeal Thermococcus kodakarensis L10 Rubisco (Fig. 1A). Rubisco from T. kodakarensis is known to be more thermostable as a L10 decamer than a L2 dimer (14.Maeda N. Kanai T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. The unique pentagonal structure of an archaeal Rubisco is essential for its high thermostability.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31656-31662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but there is as yet no molecular explanation for this stability. There is no MbR-like Mg2+-facilitated lock site in T. kodakarensis Rubisco, and packing at the T. kodakarensis Rubisco dimer-dimer interface appears to be primarily stabilized by hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. In general, ionic interactions are insufficient to maintain the structure of thermostable proteins because the pKa values of positively charged residues are sensitive to temperature fluctuations (23.Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Russell R.J. Taylor G.L. Pearl L. Enzyme thermostability and thermoactivity.Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reason L10 T. kodakarensis Rubisco is so thermostable remains unclear. The optimal temperature for MbR catalysis is 55 °C (10.Alonso H. Blayney M.J. Beck J.L. Whitney S.M. Substrate-induced assembly of Methanococcoides burtonii d-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase dimers into decamers.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33876-33882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but it is also not known whether an L10 Rubisco arrangement is intrinsically more thermostable. Analysis of the electrostatic surface charges of the MbR and T. kodakarensis L2 dimers indicates that the interface between L2 dimers (dimer-dimer interface) in T. kodakarensis includes a large number of charged residues positioned such that an extensive network of ionic interactions could facilitate dimer-dimer packing (Fig. 2B, solid circles). Although there are compatible charges at the MbR dimer-dimer interface (Fig. 2A), these are not as densely concentrated as in T. kodakarensis Rubisco, and the most highly charged areas are the negatively charged patches at the proposed lock site (Fig. 2A, solid circles). The solvent channel (interior) of L10 T. kodakarensis is highly negatively charged, which is not observed in the MbR structure (Fig. 2), and it may somehow contribute to T. kodakarensis thermostability. Furthermore, whereas salt bridges may act to stabilize the MbR L10 complex, the coordination of glutamic and aspartic acid residues (whose pKa are not drastically affected by temperature) to Mg2+ may represent the major locking mechanism of MbR L2 dimers, tethering them against one another to form higher oligomeric complexes. Site-directed mutagenesis was undertaken to provide biochemical confirmation of the proposed α1-αJ lock site (Fig. 1C). The negatively charged residues Glu-179, Asp-183, Asp-366, and Asp-368, which appear to facilitate the RAD-locking mechanism, were mutated to alanine. The positively charged residue Lys-367, which is situated between the putative Asp-366 and Asp-368 lock residues, was also mutated to alanine to determine whether this residue is important for stabilizing the lock site. Higher order oligomer formation was only impeded by the E179A mutation (Fig. 3A). Residues Asp-183, Asp-366, and Asp-368 lie in an equatorial plane around the magnesium ion with the potential to contribute up to five bonds to the lock site (Fig. 1C), and thus disrupting any one of these three residues could be compensated for by the enzyme. In contrast, Glu-179 is the only axial protein ligand to Mg2+ (the other is provided by solvent), which could explain why the E179A mutation could disrupt the lock site and impede higher MbR oligomer formation (Fig. 1C). The long positively charged side chain of Lys-367 does not seem to be important for correct positioning of the neighboring Asp-366 and Asp-368. Mutants E179A, D183A, D366A, and D368A MbR on the dimer-dimer interface exhibited altered migration on non-denaturing PAGE (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the K367A mutant migrated like unmodified MbR. Clearly, disrupting any one of the negative charges of the protein side chains at the lock site alters the charge to mass ratio and/or the hydrodynamic size of L2 MbR. However, no difference in L2 (or higher oligomer) migration was observed in the presence of 2-carboxy-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (2-CABP). These data suggest that a structural rearrangement is induced in both the assembly domain and helix α1 upon substrate binding, even if the mutant enzyme is unable to oligomerize. In the presence of 2-CABP, MbR with the D183A or D366A mutations was predominantly in the L10 form (Fig. 3A) rather than a mixture of oligomeric assemblies observed in wild-type MbR and the D368A mutant or predominantly L2 as observed in the E179A mutant. The destabilizing effect caused by mutating Asp-183 and Asp-366 (i.e. the lock site residues that tend toward bidentate) could thus be regarded as intermediate between that of the E179A and D368A mutations. To evaluate how tightly the magnesium ion is bound at the dimer-dimer lock site in higher order MbR complexes, the 2-CABP-bound MbR and the single mutant variants (Fig. 3A) were incubated with increasing concentrations of EDTA. Non-denaturing PAGE analyses indicated that EDTA was unable to pull apart higher order MbR complexes, even in the presence of 2-fold molar concentrations of EDTA (relative to the Mg2+ concentration in the buffer used for Rubisco activation and 2-CABP binding; Fig. 3C). The inability of EDTA to chelate MbR-bound Mg2+ indicates that the complex formed between Glu-179, Asp-183, Asp-366, and Asp-368 and Mg2+ is stable. Similarly, EDTA cannot chelate Mg2+ bound to the carbamylated lysine at the Rubisco active site (24.Zhu G. Jensen R.G. Status of the substrate binding sites of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase as determined with 2-C-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate.Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The double mutations D183A/D366A, D183A/D366A, and D366A/D368A were also introduced into MbR. All double mutants impeded oligomerization of MbR dimers (Fig. 3B), confirming the importance of negatively charged side chains at the lock site for MbR oligomerization. It has been previously demonstrated that MbR oligomerization could be induced by substrate RuBP and the reaction-intermediate analog 2-CABP, whereas the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle intermediates 6-phosphogluconate, ribose 5-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, or fructose 1,6-bisphosphate failed to induce oligomerization (10.Alonso H. Blayney M.J. Beck J.L. Whitney S.M. Substrate-induced assembly of Methanococcoides burtonii d-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase dimers into decamers.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33876-33882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MbR was incubated with the ligands 4-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (4-CABP), xylulose 1,5-bisphosphate (XuBP), and 3-PGA to further probe what triggers MbR oligomerization. 4-CABP and XuBP are the C3 epimers of 2-CABP and RuBP, respectively (Fig. 4A); 4-CABP is a close mimic of the reaction intermediate 2-carboxy-3-keto-d-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, and XuBP is a misfire product of RuBP that is formed at carbamylated catalytic sites on Rubisco (25.Zhu G.

Both XuBP and 4-CABP de-carbamylate the activator lysine in Rubisco during or after binding to the active site in the spinach enzyme (25.Zhu G. Jensen R.G.

Given their stereochemistry, the presence of these sugar compounds at the Rubisco active site precludes the presence of a metal ion (26.Taylor T.C. Fothergill M.D. Andersson I.

https://openalex.org/W2584381821,"Sodium-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (Ntcp/NTCP) is the major uptake transporter of bile salts in mouse and human livers. In certain diseases, including endotoxemia, cholestasis, diabetes, and hepatocarcinoma, Ntcp/NTCP expression is markedly reduced, which interferes with enterohepatic circulation of bile salts, impairing the absorption of lipophilic compounds. Therefore, normal Ntcp/NTCP expression in the liver is physiologically important. Berberine is an herbal medicine used historically to improve liver function and has recently been shown to repress STAT signaling. However, berberine effects on Ntcp/NTCP expression are unknown, prompting use to investigate this possible connection. Our results showed that berberine dose-dependently increased Ntcp expression in male mouse liver and decreased taurocholic acid levels in serum but increased them in the liver. In mouse and human hepatoma cells, berberine induced Ntcp/NTCP mRNA and protein expression and increased cellular uptake of [3H] taurocholate. Mechanistically, berberine decreased nuclear protein levels of phospho-JAK2 and phospho-STAT5, thus disrupting the JAK2-STAT5 signaling. Moreover, berberine stimulated luciferase reporter expression from the mouse Ntcp promoter when one putative STAT5 response element (RE) (-1137 bp) was deleted and from the human NTCP promoter when three putative STAT5REs (-2898, -2164, and -691 bp) were deleted. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that berberine decreased binding of phospho-STAT5 protein to the-2164 and -691 bp STAT5REs in the human NTCP promoter. In summary, berberine-disrupted STAT5 signaling promoted mouse and human Ntcp/NTCP expression, resulting in enhanced bile acid uptake. Therefore, berberine may be a therapeutic candidate compound for maintaining bile acid homeostasis."

This Reflections article describes my early work on viral enzymes and the discovery of mRNA capping, how my training in medicine and biochemistry merged as I evolved into a virologist, the development of viruses as vaccine vectors, and how scientific and technological developments during the 1970s and beyond set the stage for the interrogation of nearly every step in the reproductive cycle of vaccinia virus (VACV), a large DNA virus with about 200 genes. The reader may view this article as a work in progress, because I remain actively engaged in research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) notwithstanding 50 memorable years there. As a first generation American and the second in my family to attend college, I was encouraged to study medicine as a path to independence and security. It seemed like a sensible goal, although I imagined myself more like the fictional heroic physician-scientist Martin Arrowsmith than my family doctor. A fascinating lecture course on cell biology given by Paul R. Gross (now well known for writings on science and culture) at New York University (NYU) led me to undertake an honors project on microsome-associated enzymes under his supervision during my senior year. I enjoyed laboratory research and gave some thought to a Ph.D. program, but by that time I had been accepted to the M.D. program at NYU medical school, which emphasized basic sciences. During the first year of medical school, I particularly enjoyed the biochemistry course: Severo Ochoa (who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1959, just two years later) and the other members of his department attended all lectures, ensuring that they were up to a high standard. Bernard Horecker, another great biochemist, was chairman of microbiology. In his department's exceptional laboratory course, we transformed bacteria with DNA, thereby recapitulating the famous Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment, and also were challenged to identify the bacteria in an unknown sample (before PCR and sequencing made that trivial). In addition, I participated in a sunrise immunology discussion group led by Chandler A. Stetson, took two electives in the laboratory of Robert W. Chambers, a biochemist who trained with Har Gobind Khorana, and published my first paper on a novel chemical synthesis of ribonucleoside-5′-polyphosphates (1.Kessler D. Moss B. Chambers R.W. Synthesis of ribonucleoside-5′-polyphosphates.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 38: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The third and fourth years of medical school were spent mainly in Bellevue Hospital, which provided an intense learning experience despite being understaffed and in deteriorating physical condition. Although I continued to be strongly attracted to a career in basic science, I decided to extend my medical studies with an internship and chose pediatrics partly because I suspected genetic or infectious diseases might be an interesting future research area. I was encouraged to do this during a particularly pleasant interview with John F. Crigler, Chief of the Division of Endocrinology at the Children's Hospital in Boston, who seemed to relate my aspirations with his own. I ranked Children's number 1 for the intern-matching program because of its academic reputation and association with Harvard Medical School. My wife Toby and I were ecstatic when the acceptance came. I was 23 and Toby was 20 when we traveled from Brooklyn to Boston in June 1961 and settled in a small apartment off the Fenway, close to the hospital. Toby, a charismatic elementary school teacher, quickly secured a good position. Children's was far more up-to-date and better staffed than Bellevue; on the other hand, interns at that time were on duty every day and every other night, and the life and death responsibilities were exhilarating albeit overwhelming for a new medical graduate. In particular, the rotation in the Jimmy Fund children's cancer center was devastating, as can be imagined from the descriptions in Siddhartha Mukherjee's excellent book The Emperor of All Maladies (2.Mukherjee S. The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer. Scribner, New York2010Google Scholar). I intended to stay at Children's for one year and then go elsewhere for basic research training, so after several months I made an appointment to discuss career options with Lewis Thomas, who was Chairman of the Department of Medicine at NYU-Bellevue Medical Center. Wikipedia aptly describes Thomas as an American physician, poet, etymologist, essayist, administrator, educator, policy advisor, and researcher. He is well known for essays in the New England Journal of Medicine, a collection of which was published as The Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher (3.Thomas L. The Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher. The Viking Press, New York1974Google Scholar). As a student, I had been on medical rounds with Dr. Thomas, but I had not spoken to him previously. Nevertheless, he must have seen some potential in me during our meeting as he offered me a fellowship on a National Institutes of Health (NIH) training grant designed to further educate physicians in basic sciences. I accepted and chose to enter a Ph.D. program rather than seek a postdoctoral position, as the former would allow me to take additional science courses as well as provide a student deferment from the Doctor Draft. While completing my internship, I checked out programs at nearby Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and chose the latter. I have a vivid memory of walking along Longwood Avenue under sunny skies in June 1962 eager to begin a new stage of my life across the river in Cambridge. The Biochemistry Division at MIT, chaired by John (Jack) Buchanan, attracted me because of its integration within the Biology Department, which at that time was a quiet haven housed on three floors of the 10-year-old Dorrance Building located near the bustling hub of the campus. Additional members of the Biology Department included Eugene Bell, Gene Brown, Jim Darnell (soon to leave for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine), Maurice Fox, Vernon Ingram, Cyrus Levinthal, Salvador Luria, Boris Magasanik, Alex Rich, and Irwin Sizer. Jim Darnell describes this early period before the huge expansion of biology at MIT in a Reflections article (4.Darnell Jr., J.E. Joys and surprises of a career studying eukaryotic gene expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 12957-12966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Taking into account my medical education and desire to strengthen my background in the core sciences, Jack Buchanan allowed me to substitute mathematics and chemistry for biology elective courses. The first year at MIT provided a good learning experience, although taking final exams in a gymnasium filled with young engineering students seemed anachronistic. At the end of that year, I was ready and eager to begin research, although I still had to choose a topic and a mentor. I was influenced by the pivotal experiment of Brenner, Jacob, and Meselson (5.Brenner S. Jacob F. Meselson M. An unstable intermediate carrying information from genes to ribosomes for protein synthesis.Nature. 1961; 190: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) identifying unstable RNA as the intermediate between DNA and proteins, which had been published the year before I arrived at MIT. In extending this work to eukaryotes, Jim Darnell was isolating rapidly labeled RNA from HeLa cells and Jon Warner in Alex Rich's lab was soon to describe polyribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes. Vernon Ingram (Fig. 1), who had made the landmark discovery that sickle cell hemoglobin differed from normal by a single amino acid substitution, suggested that I investigate the regulation of hemoglobin synthesis. It was known that mammals, birds, and amphibians undergo developmental changes in their hemoglobin. Fetal and adult human hemoglobin share two of their four subunits, but the polypeptide changes that occur in birds and amphibians had not yet been determined. I thought that the molecular switch from tadpole to frog hemoglobin might be particularly appropriate for experimentation because metamorphosis could be induced by thyroxin in free-living animals. My thoughts at the time revolved around the possibility that this hormone directly or indirectly regulated transcription of hemoglobin genes. Vernon was a highly supportive mentor, although his approach to developing an independent investigator consisted of helping outline a project and then evaluating progress after several months. His hands-off style suited me as I had already benefitted from instruction in laboratory technique and close supervision by Robert W. Chambers, whose lab I had worked in while in medical school. Moreover, my responsibilities as a medical student and intern made me confident in attempting new techniques. I found that working with red proteins was a great way to hone biochemical procedures—sloppy loading or packing of a gel filtration column was immediately apparent. The hemoglobins of tadpoles and frogs migrated differently on electrophoresis (Fig. 2A) and had different subunits as shown by a variety of methods including peptide fingerprinting and N-terminal Edman degradation (6.Moss B. Ingram V.M. The repression and induction by thyroxin of hemoglobin synthesis during amphibian metamorphosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1965; 54: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The circulating erythrocytes of amphibians are nucleated, and the immature ones still synthesize hemoglobin, which could be metabolically labeled in vitro or in vivo with radioactive amino acids and heme precursors. Metamorphosis proceeded synchronously upon immersion of tadpoles in water containing thyroxin, leading to a sharp decline to near zero in synthesis of hemoglobin by red blood cells. After 8 days, hemoglobin synthesis abruptly increased due to entry into the circulatory system of immature erythrocytes that could be radioactively labeled, had a more spherical shape (Fig. 2B), and synthesized the adult frog hemoglobin (7.Moss B. Ingram V.M. Hemoglobin synthesis during amphibian metamorphosis. I. Chemical studies on the hemoglobins from the larval and adult stages of Rana catesbeiana.J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 32: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 8.Moss B. Ingram V.M. Hemoglobin synthesis during amphibian metamorphosis. II. Synthesis of adult hemoglobin following thyroxine administration.J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 32: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The data suggested a model in which thyroxin regulates the maturation or proliferation of a clonally distinct erythrocyte line. Research was going well in the spring of 1966, and I was thinking of laboratories working on gene regulation that I might join to gain additional experience when I received a letter informing me that my military deferment would soon end and requesting that I register for the draft. As a draftee with one year of pediatric training, my likely prospect seemed to be an assignment in family medicine on a military base. However, I was now fully dedicated to a career in research and therefore decided to volunteer for the U.S. Public Health Service instead and seek an assignment at the NIH. I was assured during a scouting visit that a position awaited me there upon a satisfactory physical examination and induction into the Public Health Service. With just a few months remaining at MIT, my priority was to complete experiments, and so I deferred writing a thesis, which I later completed during evenings and weekends of my first six months at NIH. I arrived in Bethesda in September 1966 with Toby and our three young children, who reveled in a large house with a backyard after living in the small Cambridge apartment. My position was in the NIAID Laboratory of Biology of Viruses (LBV), which had just merged with the Laboratory of Cell Biology following the departure of Karl Habel and Harry Eagle, the former chiefs of the two separate laboratories. Cell biologists and virologists are indebted to Harry Eagle for defining the nutritional requirements of mammalian cells in culture and will recognize his name on packages of Eagle's medium. I was warmly welcomed into LBV by the new Laboratory Chief Norman Salzman (Fig. 3), Aaron Shatkin, Malcolm Martin, Jim Rose, Lois Salzman (no relation to Norman), and Michael Bishop, who all became good colleagues. Aaron, however, soon left to head the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, and Mike moved to San Francisco, where he and Harold Varmus later discovered the cellular origin of a retroviral oncogene for which they received a Nobel Prize. I had come to the NIH with the expectation of working with Norman on the isolation and characterization of mammalian chromosomes, although LBV was mainly a virology laboratory. Upon my arrival, however, Norman informed me that the chromosome project was being phased out but that there was an opening to work on vaccinia virus (VACV), because he had recently switched from this virus to the much smaller polyoma virus. Although I had never taken a virology course and had not planned on working with viruses, I was content nonetheless because viruses provide unique models for studying gene expression and of course have important medical significance. Moreover, because of an assignment to write a review of poxviruses as part of my Ph.D. qualifying exam at MIT, I was already fascinated by their unusual life cycle. VACV and cowpox virus are well known as the live vaccines used by Edward Jenner to prevent smallpox caused by the closely related variola virus. In fact, 1966 was the year that the World Health Organization mounted its ultimately successful smallpox eradication program with VACV. Poxviruses, of which VACV is the prototype, were the largest known animal viruses at the time (although this honor now falls to pandoravirus). Unlike other viruses with DNA genomes, the poxviruses replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus of infected cells (Fig. 4). Early experiments suggesting that poxviruses encode enzymes for replication and reports by Brian McAuslan, Wolfgang (Bill) Joklik, and Norman Salzman, showing that VACV replication is divided into early and late phases, meshed with my interest in the regulation of gene expression. Additionally, there was evidence for rapidly turning-over cytoplasmic poxviral RNA (9.Becker Y. Joklik W.K. Messenger RNA in cells infected with vaccinia virus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1964; 51: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10.Salzman N.P. Shatkin A.J. Sebring E.D. The synthesis of a DNA-like RNA in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells infected with vaccinia virus.J. Mol. biol. 1964; 8: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which in 1967 Oda and Joklik (11.Oda K.I. Joklik W.K. Hybridization and sedimentation studies on “early” and “late” vaccinia messenger RNA.J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 27: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) characterized as early and late mRNA by hybridization to DNA. The Reflections article by Joklik provides some background for the latter work (12.Joklik W.K. Adventures of a biochemist in virology.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40385-40397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Although the basis for the hemoglobin switch that I studied at MIT was too complex for molecular studies with the tools available, the tractability of the VACV system, as shown by the research done thus far, gave me hopes that discovering how viral genes are turned on and off would be more feasible. My initial experiments analyzed the time course of gene expression in detail by pulse-labeling cells with radioactive amino acids and resolving proteins by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, methods that I had used at MIT. Those experiments documented a profound inhibition of cellular protein synthesis and the consecutive production of early, intermediate, and late classes of viral proteins (13.Moss B. Salzman N.P. Sequential protein synthesis following vaccinia virus infection.J. Virol. 1968; 2: 1016-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); my subsequent studies explained these phases by showing that VACV encodes three sets of transcription factors with cognate promoters. My enthusiasm for studying viruses in general and VACV in particular was further enhanced during attendance at the first Gordon Conference on Animal Cells and Viruses held in June 1967 at the Tilton School in New Hampshire. These annual meetings (emphasizing cell biology and virology in alternate years) became the premier place to meet colleagues and hear the latest advances in the related disciplines. Indeed, many cell biologists got their start in virology because viruses provided relatively simple experimental systems. At the 1967 conference, Joe Kates and Bill Munyon independently announced (and subsequently published, see Refs. 14.Kates J.R. McAuslan B.R. Poxvirus DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1967; 58: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar and 15.Munyon W. Paoletti E. Grace Jr., J.T. RNA polymerase activity in purified infectious vaccinia virus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1967; 58: 2280-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that infectious poxvirus particles have RNA polymerase activity, providing an explanation for the synthesis of mRNA by a cytoplasmic DNA virus. This discovery, suggesting that the encapsulated enzymes are brought into cells by the infecting virus, was particularly exciting because it came at a time when contemporary thinking was influenced by the Hershey-Chase experiment (16.Hershey A.D. Chase M. Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acid in growth of bacteriophage.J. Gen. Physiol. 1952; 36: 39-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), which showed that bacteriophage DNA entered cells but that the detectable proteins were excluded. The presence of RNA polymerase in poxvirus virions motivated subsequent efforts to find polymerase activities in RNA viruses and retroviruses. Indeed, the following year Shatkin and Sipe (17.Shatkin A.J. Sipe J.D. RNA polymerase activity in purified reoviruses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1968; 61: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) described RNA polymerase activity in particles of reovirus, a double-stranded RNA virus. In the meantime, work on poxvirus transcription was invigorated. The findings of Kates and Munyon and other studies strongly implied but did not actually prove a viral origin of the polymerase activity encapsulated in the particle or an essential role of the enzyme in virus replication. A paper (18.Subak-Sharpe J.H. Timbury M.C. Williams J.F. Rifampicin inhibits the growth of some mammalian viruses.Nature. 1969; 222: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) ostensibly showing that rifampicin, a specific inhibitor of bacterial but not mammalian DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, interferes with VACV gene expression added support for a viral origin. Because a specific inhibitor of the poxvirus RNA polymerase would be a valuable tool, I attempted to confirm and extend the rifampicin story. I discovered, however, that the drug actually has no direct effect on VACV gene expression. In collaboration with Phil Grimley, an electron microscopist at NIH (Fig. 5), and others, we showed that rifampicin was a specific inhibitor of viral membrane assembly (19.Moss B. Rosenblum E.N. Katz E. Grimley P.M. Rifampicin: a specific inhibitor of vaccinia virus assembly.Nature. 1969; 224: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), which proved valuable in later studies on viral morphogenesis. Although a specific chemical inhibitor would have been extremely useful for investigating poxvirus transcription, in any case a direct biochemical approach such as that taken in 1969 by Roeder and Rutter (97.Roeder R.G. Rutter W.J. Multiple forms of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in eukaryotic organisms.Nature. 1969; 224: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) in partially purifying eukaryotic DNA-dependent RNA polymerases was needed. Although it took six more years to determine the subunit structure of mammalian RNA polymerase II (20.Schwartz L.B. Roeder R.G. Purification and subunit structure of deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent ribonucleic acid polymerase II from the mouse plasmacytoma, MOPC 315.J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were motivated to attempt purification and characterization of the viral enzyme. Up to this time, my experience purifying proteins was limited to hemoglobin. Nevertheless, as a descendent of Harry Eagle's lab, LBV was a great place to undertake a project requiring large amounts of virus: the support staff carried over from Harry Eagle's time made cell culture medium from scratch, bled horses at a nearby farm, and filter-sterilized the serum, allowing us to routinely grow large volumes of HeLa cells, for which we used custom-made 6-liter vented bottles set on magnetic stirrers. Virus particles are designed to withstand environmental stresses, and this is particularly true for poxviruses, which are resistant to high temperatures and desiccation. Therefore, my first task was to devise a way to extract soluble proteins from the virus core. Non-ionic detergents removed only membrane-embedded surface proteins, whereas strong detergents such as SDS inactivated enzyme activity. Through experimentation, I discovered that appropriate concentrations of deoxycholate, NaCl, and dithiothreitol released the enzymes including the RNA polymerase while leaving the abundant structural proteins insoluble. The next step was to devise quantitative assays for the RNA polymerase and other enzymes and proteins needed for mRNA synthesis that were predicted to be present in the virus, as the genome had not yet been sequenced and was essentially a black box. Enzyme purifications were carried out with 60–90 mg of starting virus, making high recovery of activity at each step important. Looking back, it seems remarkable that we succeeded in purifying numerous enzymes from virus cores, including the two-subunit poly(A) polymerase (Fig. 6) (21.Moss B. Rosenblum E.N. Paoletti E. Polyadenylate polymerase from vaccinia virions.Nat. New Biol. 1973; 245: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), DNA- and RNA-dependent nucleoside triphosphatases (22.Paoletti E.

Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) factors to near homogeneity, and in some cases before proteins with comparable functions were isolated from mammalian cells. These studies were carried out with a succession of talented postdoctoral fellows; some with MDs had their first research experience in my laboratory. In 1974, Perry and Kelley (31.Perry R.P. Kelley D.E. Existence of methylated messenger RNA in mouse L cells.Cell. 1974; 1: 37-42Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (298) Google Scholar) took advantage of new methods of rigorously purifying mRNA based on the poly(A) tail to demonstrate that polyadenylated RNA from mouse L cells contains on average 2.2 methyl groups per 1,000 nucleotides. Their data suggested that both the base and the ribose moieties were methylated, although the modified nucleotides were not identified. They further speculated that the methyl groups were in a non-coding portion of the mRNA, possibly at the 5′ end. Because VACV mRNA is also polyadenylated, my immediate thought was to determine whether VACV mRNA is also modified by methylation. At this particular time Aaron Shatkin was visiting NIH, and he told me that Kin-ichiro Miura and colleagues in Japan had found that the ends of encapsulated double-stranded RNAs of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV) were blocked and that methylation was suspected, which they subsequently published (32.Miura K. Watanabe K. Sugiura M. 5′-Terminal nucleotide sequences of the double-stranded RNA of silkworm cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus.J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In turn, I cited Bob Perry's recent paper and my thought that viral mRNAs might be methylated. Although VACV is a double-stranded DNA virus, whereas CPV and reovirus—Shatkin's focus—are double-stranded RNA viruses, the infectious particle contains endogenous transcriptase activity in each case. We agreed to test the idea that viral mRNAs are methylated in my laboratory by incubating the four ribonucleoside triphosphates and radioactive S-adenosylmethionine with purified VACV, and in Aaron's laboratory by performing the experiment with reovirus. The next week, I called Aaron and left a message that VACV mRNA is methylated (Fig. 7A), and a few hours later, he called back to say that reovirus mRNA is also methylated. After further work, we separately but simultaneously submitted these exciting results for publication (33.Wei C.M. Moss B. Methylation of newly synthesized viral messenger RNA by an enzyme in vaccinia virus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 3014-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34.Shatkin A.J. Methylated messenger RNA synthesis in vitro by purified reovirus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 3204-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The next step was to investigate the nature and location of the methylated nucleotides, which I determined with a postdoc Cha Mer Wei, and which was independently determined by Aaron Shatkin working with Yasuhiro Furuichi—originally from Miura's group—along with other colleagues. The ability to synthesize the viral RNAs in vitro specifically labeled with [α-, β-, or γ-32P]ribonucleoside triphosphates was an important factor in deriving the cap structure and its mode of formation in both of our labs. Without divulging the structure in advance, Aaron and I simultaneously submitted our findings for publication (35.Wei C.M. Moss B. Methylated nucleotides block 5′-terminus of vaccinia virus mRNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1975; 72: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 36.Furuichi Y. Morgan M. Muthukrishnan S.

U.S.A. 1975; 72: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and mailed copies of the accepted manuscripts to each other. It was gratifying to find that we had independently arrived at the same novel structure (Fig. 7B), which was subsequently termed a cap, with a terminal 7-methylguanosine connected to the penultimate 2′-O-methylated nucleotide via a novel 5′ to 5′ triphosphate linkage. The only difference between the VACV and reovirus caps are that the former caps can contain either a guanine or an adenine base (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)Am- or m7G(5′)ppp(5′)Gm-), whereas the latter only contain guanine (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)Gm-). After determining the nature of viral caps and describing the relevant analytical methods, it was straightforward for us and others to determine the 5′-RNA structures of additional mRNAs including HeLa cell polyadenylated RNA (37.Wei C.M.

For example, expression from the human α-globin gene locus, comprising α-, δ-, ɛ-, and γ-globin genes, switches from ɛ-globin to γ-globin during embryonic development and then from γ-globin to α-globin after birth. Expression of human ɛ-globin in mice has been shown to ameliorate anemia caused by α-globin mutations, including those causing α-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, raising the prospect that reactivation of ɛ-globin expression could be used in managing these conditions in humans. Although the human globin genes are known to be regulated by a variety of multiprotein complexes containing enzymes that catalyze epigenetic modifications, the exact mechanisms controlling ɛ-globin gene silencing remain elusive. Here we found that the heterochromatin protein HP1γ, a multifunctional chromatin- and DNA-binding protein with roles in transcriptional activation and elongation, represses ɛ-globin expression by interacting with a histone-modifying enzyme, lysine methyltransferase SUV4–20h2. Silencing of HP1γ expression markedly decreased repressive histone marks and the multimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 and H4 lysine 20, leading to a significant decrease in DNA methylation at the proximal promoter of the ɛ-globin gene and greatly increased ɛ-globin expression. In addition, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we showed that SUV4–20h2 facilitates the deposition of HP1γ on the ɛ-globin-proximal promoter. Thus, these data indicate that HP1γ is a novel epigenetic repressor of ɛ-globin gene expression and provide a potential strategy for targeted therapies for α-thalassemia and sickle cell disease.

In contrast to HP1α and HP1α, HP1γ can also localize to euchromatin, thus functioning in transcriptional elongation and RNA processing (16.Smallwood Smallwood Hon Hon Jin Jin Henry Henry Espinosa Espinosa Ren Ren CBX3 regulates efficient RNA processing genome-wide.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For example, HP1γ decreases the RNA polymerase II elongation rate, thus affect the alternative splicing of multiple genes (17.Saint-André Saint-André Batsché Batsché Rachez Rachez Muchardt Muchardt Histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation and HP1γ favor inclusion of alternative exons.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). By searching the HP1γ ChIP sequencing data in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, NCBI) datasets, we found that HP1γ is located on the α-globin gene locus in K562 cells. Consistently with this finding, our previous data have demonstrated that methylated histone H3K9, a marker specifically recognized by HP1 via the evolutionarily conserved chromodomain, is enriched at the γ-globin promoter (18.Rank Rank Cerruti Cerruti Simpson Simpson Moritz Moritz Jane Jane Zhao Zhao Identification of a PRMT5-dependent repressor complex linked to silencing of human fetal globin gene expression.Blood. 2010; 116: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether HP1γ is involved in the regulation of the expression of the α-globin gene cluster and how this process works. heterochromatin protein 1 knockdown scrambled quantitative real-time PCR DNA methyltransferase dimethylation or trimethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9. In this study, we reveal that HP1γ binds most strongly to the ɛ-globin promoter among those of the globin genes, thereby inducing coordinated repressive histone marks and DNA methylation. In K562 cells, HP1γ interacts with an H4K20me2/3 methyltransferase, SUV4–20h2, which promotes association of HP1γ with chromatin and results in silencing of ɛ-globin gene expression. These results demonstrate that HP1γ coordinates with SUV4–20h2 in repressing human embryonic globin expression. Our previous studies have demonstrated that PRMT5 induces a range of coordinated repressive epigenetic marks in erythroid cells, including H3K9me3, on the γ-promoter (18.Rank Rank Cerruti Cerruti Simpson Simpson Moritz Moritz Jane Jane Zhao Zhao Identification of a PRMT5-dependent repressor complex linked to silencing of human fetal globin gene expression.Blood. 2010; 116: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because the HP1 protein is an epigenetic reader of histone H3K9me3 via the conserved chromodomain, and HP1γ localizes to both the heterochromatic and euchromatic regions involved in gene expression regulation (12.Canzio Canzio Larson Larson Narlikar Narlikar Mechanisms of functional promiscuity by HP1 proteins.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that HP1γ might bind the globin genes participating in the modulation of globin gene expression. ChIP analysis across the α-locus by using HP1γ-specific antibodies demonstrated that HP1γ had a higher enrichment on the proximal promoter of ɛ-globin than that of the γ- or α-globins in K562 cells (Fig. 1A). We also found that HP1γ was enriched at the DNA hypersensitive sites HS4 and HS2 (Fig. 1A), two important enhancers of the α-globin gene (19.Li Li Peterson Peterson Fang Fang Stamatoyannopoulos Stamatoyannopoulos Locus control regions.Blood. 2002; 100: 3077-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To determine whether HP1γ regulates ɛ-globin gene expression, we generated two HP1γ stable knockdown K562 cell lines by using lentiviral vectors containing specific shRNAs. In the knockdown lines (HP1γ-KD), HP1γ mRNA levels were decreased to ∼20% that of scramble (Scr) K562 cells (Fig. 1B). Reduced protein levels were confirmed by Western blotting analysis using an anti-HP1γ-specific antibody without changes of HP1α and HP1α (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, Q-RT-PCR showed a more than 65-fold increase in ɛ-globin expression, whereas HP1γ knockdown resulted in only a 3.5-fold increase in γ-globin expression and a reduction in α-globin expression (Fig. 1D). No significant induction of α-globin gene expression was found in response to knocking down HP1γ. Western blotting analysis confirmed that ɛ-globin protein levels were markedly increased in the HP1γ-KD cells compared with Scr cells (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that HP1γ represses human ɛ-globin gene transcription in K562 cells. The HP1 protein is an epigenetic reader of histone H3K9me3 that relies on a conserved chromodomain (12.Canzio Canzio Larson Larson Narlikar Narlikar Mechanisms of functional promiscuity by HP1 proteins.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that, when HP1γ was knocked down, the H3K9me2/3 histone marks in the region of the proximal promoter of the ɛ-globin gene were significantly decreased in a feedback mechanism (Fig. 2A). Additionally, we found that the H4K20me2/3 histone marks in the same region were also significantly reduced in HP1γ knockdown cells compared with Scr cells (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with the scenario occurring on the γ-promoter, in which histone marks such as H3K9 methylation and H4K20 methylation are coordinately regulated (18.Rank Rank Cerruti Cerruti Simpson Simpson Moritz Moritz Jane Jane Zhao Zhao Identification of a PRMT5-dependent repressor complex linked to silencing of human fetal globin gene expression.Blood. 2010; 116: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The results also strongly suggest that HP1γ might closely associate with a methyltransferase that, in turn, deposits a histone mark, e.g. methylated H4K20. At the heterochromatin level, HP1γ has been shown to interact with SUV4–20h2 and, consequently, recruit SUV4–20h2 to heterochromatin (20.Schotta Schotta Lachner Lachner Sarma Sarma Ebert Ebert Sengupta Sengupta Reuter Reuter Reinberg Reinberg Jenuwein Jenuwein A silencing pathway to induce H3-K9 and H4-K20 trimethylation at constitutive heterochromatin.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Indeed, our co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that HP1γ interacted with SUV4–20h2 in erythroid K562 cells (Fig. 2C). Because antibodies suitable for ChIP analysis of human SUV4–20h2 are currently not available, we were not able to perform ChIP experiments to determine the enrichment of endogenous SUV4–20h2 at the ɛ-promoter. Hence, we used a K562 cell line stably overexpressing HA-tagged SUV4–20h2 and performed ChIP analysis using an anti-HA antibody. SUV4–20h2 was enriched in the region of the proximal promoter of the ɛ-globin gene (Fig. 2, D and E), which is the same region in which HP1γ also bound the ɛ-globin gene (Fig. 2, D and F). These results indicate that HP1γ coordinates with SUV4–20h2, thus potentially resulting in modulation of histone methylation on the ɛ-globin gene. To determine the potential role of SUV4–20h2 in ɛ-globin gene regulation, we generated two stable SUV4–20h2 knockdown K562 cell lines by using lentiviral vectors containing specific shRNAs. SUV4–20h2 mRNA levels and protein levels were examined by Q-RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis, respectively. The SUV4–20h2 expression levels were reduced in these two cell lines (SUV4–20h2-KD) to ∼40% that in cells transduced with scrambled control RNA (Fig. 3, A and B). ɛ-Globin gene expression was quantified by Q-RT-PCR, and the ɛ-globin mRNA level was 60-fold higher in SUV4–20h2-KD cells than in Scr control cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, no significant induction of either γ-globin or the α-globin was observed (Fig. 3C). This was accompanied by a reduction of α-globin expression (Fig. 3C). The protein levels of ɛ-globin were confirmed to be markedly induced in SUV4–20h2 knockdown cells compared with Scr control cells (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that SUV4–20h2 represses ɛ-globin gene transcription in K562 cells. SUV4–20h2 is a lysine methyltransferase that has been linked to gene repression through the establishment of H4K20me2/3 histone marks (20.Schotta Schotta Lachner Lachner Sarma Sarma Ebert Ebert Sengupta Sengupta Reuter Reuter Reinberg Reinberg Jenuwein Jenuwein A silencing pathway to induce H3-K9 and H4-K20 trimethylation at constitutive heterochromatin.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). To examine whether SUV4–20h2 functions on histones associated with the ɛ-globin gene, we performed ChIP analyses using specific antibodies against polymethylated histone H4K20 (H4K20me2/3). As expected, the enrichment of H4K20 methylation, particularly H4K20me3, was significantly reduced at the ɛ-globin promoter in SUV4–20h2-KD cells compared with Scr cells (Fig. 4A). At constitutive heterochromatin, after stable binding of the HP1 molecule to trimethylated histone H3K9 nucleosomes, HP1 recruits the SUV4–20h enzyme, which methylates H4K20 (20.Schotta Schotta Lachner Lachner Sarma Sarma Ebert Ebert Sengupta Sengupta Reuter Reuter Reinberg Reinberg Jenuwein Jenuwein A silencing pathway to induce H3-K9 and H4-K20 trimethylation at constitutive heterochromatin.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). We then tested whether SUV4–20h2 also affects HP1γ binding to chromatin. We lysed Scr and SUV4–20h2-KD cells with NETN300 solution (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 300 mm NaCl), from which loosely chromatin-bound proteins were eluted from genomic DNA through 300 mm NaCl treatment (S1 fraction in Fig. 4B). The chromatin proteins tightly associated with genomic DNA were thus released into the soluble fraction after the genomic DNA was digested by benzonase (C1 fraction in Fig. 4B). We found that significantly less HP1γ was released into the soluble fraction in SUV4–20h2 knockdown cells than in Scr cells after the genomic DNA was digested with benzonase (21.Hahn Hahn Dambacher Dambacher Dulev Dulev Kuznetsova Kuznetsova Eck Eck Worz Worz Sadic Sadic Schulte Schulte Mallm Mallm Maiser Maiser Debs Debs von Melchner von Melchner Leonhardt Leonhardt Schermelleh Schermelleh Rohr Rohr et al.Suv4–20h2 mediates chromatin compaction and is important for cohesin recruitment to heterochromatin.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22.Bian Bian Chen Chen Yu Yu The zinc finger proteins ZNF644 and WIZ regulate the G9a/GLP complex for gene repression.eLife. 2015; 4: e05606Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that depletion of SUV4–20h2 resulted in less HP1γ deposition on chromatin. In agreement with this finding, the enrichment of HP1γ on the ɛ-promoter was significantly reduced after SUV4–20h2 was knocked down in K562 cells (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, we observed that the enrichment of H3K9me2 on the ɛ-promoter was also significantly reduced in SUV4–20h2 knockdown cells compared with Scr cells. The enrichment of H3K9me3 was not changed in this context (Fig. 4D). Together, these results suggest that SUV4–20h2 facilitates the localization of HP1γ on the ɛ-globin gene. In addition to histone modification, DNA methylation has also been shown to be important in modulating globin gene expression (23.Lessard Lessard Beaudoin Beaudoin Benkirane Benkirane Lettre Lettre Comparison of DNA methylation profiles in human fetal and adult red blood cell progenitors.Genome Med. 2015; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24.Lavelle Lavelle Vaitkus Vaitkus Hankewych Hankewych Singh Singh DeSimone DeSimone Developmental changes in DNA methylation and covalent histone modifications of chromatin associated with the ɛ-, γ-, and α-globin gene promoters in Papio anubis.Blood Cells Mol.

Dis. 2008; 40: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that the levels of DNA methylation of three CpG dinucleotides in the proximal promoter of the ɛ-globin gene were greatly reduced in SUV4–20h1 knockdown cells compared with scrambled control cells (26.Wang Wang Rank Rank Li Li Wang Wang Ju Ju Nuber Nuber Wu Wu Liu Liu Nie Nie Huang Huang Cerruti Cerruti Ma Ma Tan Tan Schotta Schotta Jane Jane et al.ɛ-Globin expression is regulated by SUV4–20h1.Haematologica. 2016; 101: e168-e172Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In view of this, we set out to examine whether DNA methylation of the ɛ-globin gene was affected by HP1γ by using bisulfite DNA sequencing. After HP1γ was knocked down, the methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the proximal promoter of the ɛ-globin gene in the cells was also significantly reduced compared with that in Scr cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, these methylation sites were largely coincident with the HP1γ binding site on the ɛ-globin gene (Figs. 2F and 5A). Consistent with these results, the enrichment of DNMT3A on the related gene region was also significantly decreased in HP1γ-KD cells (Fig. 5B). These data are consistent with the induction of ɛ-globin gene expression in HP1γ knockdown cells, thus suggesting that HP1γ, SUV4–20h2, and DNMT3A exert coordinated functions in ɛ-gene silencing. Among HP1 family members, HP1γ is unique in that it is located at both euchromatin and heterochromatin (12.Canzio Canzio Larson Larson Narlikar Narlikar Mechanisms of functional promiscuity by HP1 proteins.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17.Saint-André Saint-André Batsché Batsché Rachez Rachez Muchardt Muchardt Histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation and HP1γ favor inclusion of alternative exons.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that HP1γ coordinates with SUV4–20h2 and, consequently, induces deposition of repressive histone marks and DNA methylation, thereby silencing ɛ-globin gene expression. Constitutive heterochromatin is characterized by the presence of nucleosomes rich in H3K9me3 and H4K20me3. The current model suggests that the H3K9me3 mark triggered by the H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39h stabilizes HP1 binding at heterochromatin. HP1 then recruits SUV4–20h, which generates the histone mark H4K20me3 (20.Schotta Schotta Lachner Lachner Sarma Sarma Ebert Ebert Sengupta Sengupta Reuter Reuter Reinberg Reinberg Jenuwein Jenuwein A silencing pathway to induce H3-K9 and H4-K20 trimethylation at constitutive heterochromatin.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 21.Hahn Hahn Dambacher Dambacher Dulev Dulev Kuznetsova Kuznetsova Eck Eck Worz Worz Sadic Sadic Schulte Schulte Mallm Mallm Maiser Maiser Debs Debs von Melchner von Melchner Leonhardt Leonhardt Schermelleh Schermelleh Rohr Rohr et al.Suv4–20h2 mediates chromatin compaction and is important for cohesin recruitment to heterochromatin.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our results show that HP1γ interacts with SUV4–20h2 and that its loss leads to a decrease in the histone marks H3K9me3 and H4K20me2/3 at the ɛ-promoter. These observations support this model and represent a novel feedback mechanism that occurs beyond heterochromatin modification. Furthermore, we show that SUV4–20h2 can also help affect the deposition of HP1γ on the chromatin and at the ɛ-promoter, thus providing an important complement for the model. These results indicate that the methylations of H3K9 and H4K20 are functionally linked. Further systematic studies are needed to address whether the H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39h or G9a and two other HP1 family members, HP1α or HP1α, affect human globin expression. We also showed that HP1γ represses γ-globin gene expression to a lesser extent. It would be interesting to determine how HP1γ regulates γ-globin gene expression. In our previous studies, we have shown that SUV4–20h1 plays a role in repressing ɛ-globin and γ-globin gene expression (18.Rank Rank Cerruti Cerruti Simpson Simpson Moritz Moritz Jane Jane Zhao Zhao Identification of a PRMT5-dependent repressor complex linked to silencing of human fetal globin gene expression.Blood. 2010; 116: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26.Wang Wang Rank Rank Li Li Wang Wang Ju Ju Nuber Nuber Wu Wu Liu Liu Nie Nie Huang Huang Cerruti Cerruti Ma Ma Tan Tan Schotta Schotta Jane Jane et al.ɛ-Globin expression is regulated by SUV4–20h1.Haematologica. 2016; 101: e168-e172Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), similar to SUV4–20h2 in this study. However, we found that SUV4–20h1 and SUV4–20h2 behave differently in globin gene regulation. First, we observed that the extent of repression of ɛ-globin and γ-globin expression by the two proteins was different. In SUV4–20h1 knockdown K562 cells, the ɛ-globin and γ-globin expression levels were induced by over 400-fold and 10-fold, respectively (18.Rank Rank Cerruti Cerruti Simpson Simpson Moritz Moritz Jane Jane Zhao Zhao Identification of a PRMT5-dependent repressor complex linked to silencing of human fetal globin gene expression.Blood. 2010; 116: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26.Wang Wang Rank Rank Li Li Wang Wang Ju Ju Nuber Nuber Wu Wu Liu Liu Nie Nie Huang Huang Cerruti Cerruti Ma Ma Tan Tan Schotta Schotta Jane Jane et al.ɛ-Globin expression is regulated by SUV4–20h1.Haematologica. 2016; 101: e168-e172Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), whereas, in SUV4–20h2 knockdown K562 cells, the ɛ-globin expression levels were increased by 60-fold, and no induction of γ-globin expression was observed, although the knockdown efficiencies of the two were not the same. In addition, the ɛ-globin gene appeared to be more sensitive to the SUV4–20h proteins than the γ-globin gene (18.Rank Rank Cerruti Cerruti Simpson Simpson Moritz Moritz Jane Jane Zhao Zhao Identification of a PRMT5-dependent repressor complex linked to silencing of human fetal globin gene expression.Blood. 2010; 116: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26.Wang Wang Rank Rank Li Li Wang Wang Ju Ju Nuber Nuber Wu Wu Liu Liu Nie Nie Huang Huang Cerruti Cerruti Ma Ma Tan Tan Schotta Schotta Jane Jane et al.ɛ-Globin expression is regulated by SUV4–20h1.Haematologica. 2016; 101: e168-e172Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These results suggest that SUV4–20h1 and SUV4–20h2 have distinct roles in gene regulation. In fact, genetic studies have demonstrated that SUV4–20h1 and SUV4–20h2 are not redundant: mice deficient in SUV4–20h2 are viable, whereas SUV4–20h1 knockout mice die perinatally and show overall growth retardation (27.Schotta Schotta Sengupta Sengupta Kubicek Kubicek Malin Malin Kauer Kauer Callén Callén Celeste Celeste Pagani Pagani Opravil Opravil De La Rosa-Velazquez De La Rosa-Velazquez Espejo Espejo Bedford Bedford Nussenzweig Nussenzweig Busslinger Busslinger Jenuwein Jenuwein A chromatin-wide transition to H4K20 monomethylation impairs genome integrity and programmed DNA rearrangements in the mouse.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Second, SUV4–20h1 may recruit different multiprotein repressors from SUV4–20h2. In previous studies, we found that SUV4–20h1 interacts with the PRMT5 complex, including DNMT3A, thus resulting in deposition of the H4K20me3 mark at the ɛ-promoter (18.Rank Rank Cerruti Cerruti Simpson Simpson Moritz Moritz Jane Jane Zhao Zhao Identification of a PRMT5-dependent repressor complex linked to silencing of human fetal globin gene expression.Blood. 2010; 116: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26.Wang Wang Rank Rank Li Li Wang Wang Ju Ju Nuber Nuber Wu Wu Liu Liu Nie Nie Huang Huang Cerruti Cerruti Ma Ma Tan Tan Schotta Schotta Jane Jane et al.ɛ-Globin expression is regulated by SUV4–20h1.Haematologica. 2016; 101: e168-e172Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 28.Zhao Zhao Rank Rank Tan Tan Li Li Moritz Moritz Simpson Simpson Cerruti Cerruti Curtis Curtis Patel Patel Allis Allis Cunningham Cunningham Jane Jane PRMT5-mediated methylation of histone H4R3 recruits DNMT3A, coupling histone and DNA methylation in gene silencing.Nat.

Intriguingly, we did not find the HP1 protein in association with the PRMT5 multiprotein repressor complex (18.Rank Rank Cerruti Cerruti Simpson Simpson Moritz Moritz Jane Jane Zhao Zhao Identification of a PRMT5-dependent repressor complex linked to silencing of human fetal globin gene expression.Blood. 2010; 116: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified an interaction between SUV4–20h2 and HP1γ, thus suggesting that there may be at least two independent complexes located at the ɛ-promoter and that the recruitment of SUV4–20h2 in this setting may occur through a similar mechanism as that observed at pericentric heterochromatin. DNA methylation and histone methylation play essential and coordinated roles in globin gene silencing (23.Lessard Lessard Beaudoin Beaudoin Benkirane Benkirane Lettre Lettre Comparison of DNA methylation profiles in human fetal and adult red blood cell progenitors.Genome Med. 2015; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24.Lavelle Lavelle Vaitkus Vaitkus Hankewych Hankewych Singh Singh DeSimone DeSimone Developmental changes in DNA methylation and covalent histone modifications of chromatin associated with the ɛ-, γ-, and α-globin gene promoters in Papio anubis.Blood Cells Mol.

Direct links between these processes are emerging, including interactions observed among the DNA methyltransferase, arginine methyltransferase, and methyl-CpG binding proteins (3.Ginder Ginder Epigenetic regulation of fetal globin gene expression in adult erythroid cells.Transl.

In this study, we show that histone lysine methylation and DNA methylation are directly linked in the context of human ɛ-globin gene silencing. The histone lysine methyltransferase SUV4–20h2 deposits the repressive histone H4K20me2/3 mark, which may act as a necessary trigger for subsequent H3K9 methylation. Methylated H3K9 is a template for the direct binding of HP1γ and the recruitment of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) to these sites, thus enhancing cytosine methylation.

Aneurysms are the abnormal enlargement of arteries and can lead to death if the artery wall bursts. Oller et al. studied patients with Marfan syndrome, an inherited genetic condition in which individuals are prone to cardiac aneurysms. They discovered lower levels of ADAMTS1 in the heart tissue of Marfan syndrome patients compared with that of organ transplant donors. Genetic inactivation of ADAMTS1 in mice resulted in a Marfan syndrome-like disease, which included low blood pressure, aortic dilation, and aneurysm development. These effects were driven by enhanced activity of nitric oxide, and treatment with a nitric oxide inhibitor reduced blood vessel size and reversed the clinical signs of aneurysm formation.

It is not easy being a cancer cell, so such cells may need help from factors other than oncogenes that contribute to the cancer cell phenotype. Bublik et al. identify such a factor in protein fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13). FGF13 does not function like a regular growth factor. Instead, it acts in the nucleolus to repress transcription of ribosomal RNA and inhibit protein synthesis. Furthermore, it is tightly linked to the action of the tumor suppressor p53. The p53 protein inhibits expression of the FGF 13 gene, which also encodes a microRNA that in turn down-regulates p53, forming a negative feedback loop. FGF13 may help cancer cells avoid the toxic effects of excessive protein synthesis and could therefore be targeted for cancer therapy.

It was her careful study of the motion of stars that convinced astronomers that there was more to galaxies than met the eye. Astronomers say she discovered compelling evidence for “dark matter.” Vera would have said that she was just an observer reporting the data and that it was possible that our understanding of gravity is inadequate or that nature harbors some other anomaly. She didn't claim the truth, but she found wonder."

We normally think of a crystal lattice as consisting of atoms. At low temperatures and densities, however, electrons are expected to form a crystal of their own—the so-called Wigner crystal. This phase is very fragile and thus tricky to detect reliably. Jang et al. used pulsed tunneling spectroscopy to detect signatures of this elusive phase in the form of sharp resonances that appeared when the solid, a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, was exposed to high magnetic fields. The resonances appeared as a consequence of vibrations of the Wigner lattice. Their sharpness suggested longrange correlations in the crystal. The technique may be applicable to probing other electronic orders.

Despite burgeoning research in Neanderthal archaeology in recent years, much remains to be discovered about their interactions with the paleoenvironment. Using a species distribution modeling approach, Benito et al. studied how climate and topography shaped Neanderthal distribution in Europe during the Last Interglacial optimum around 120 thousand years ago, when the climate was warmer than it is today. Archaeological records and paleoclimatic data indicate that Mediterranean coastal regions with locally varied topography and mild summers were the most favored habitat. Montane regions such as the Alps and Pyrenees, as well as the central European plains, once thought to be the core Neanderthal habitat, were suboptimal because of low winter temperatures.

The book focuses on four critical aspects of the epidemic: the public reaction to the outbreak, the organizations and individuals who responded to it, how care was delivered, and the containment of infection. Although vignettes and case studies are included that provide readers with a vivid on-the-ground perspective, it is the book9s examination of politics, policies, and decisions that offers critical insight into the epidemic."

Immigrants granted legal status in Italy committed less crime compared with those who were not granted legal status. Applications for legal status are submitted online at particular times each year (“click days”) and processed on a first-come, first-served basis. Pinotti accessed data on the timing of over 110,000 applications on click days in 2007 and compared applicants who submitted before versus after the quota was reached (usually within 30 to 60 min). In the year after the click days, the crime rate declined from 1.1 to 0.8% for immigrants who applied before the cutoff but remained at 1.1% for those who missed the cutoff. The effect is dominated by those having few economic opportunities before legalization.
