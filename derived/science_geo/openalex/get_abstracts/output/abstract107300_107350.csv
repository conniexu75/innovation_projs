https://openalex.org/W2032438721,"Representational difference analysis was used to isolate unique sequences present in more than 90 percent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) tissues obtained from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These sequences were not present in tissue DNA from non-AIDS patients, but were present in 15 percent of non-KS tissue DNA samples from AIDS patients. The sequences are homologous to, but distinct from, capsid and tegument protein genes of the Gammaherpesvirinae, herpesvirus saimiri and Epstein-Barr virus. These KS-associated herpesvirus-like (KSHV) sequences appear to define a new human herpesvirus."

https://openalex.org/W2125068279,"A Xenopus gene whose expression can be activated by the organizer-specific homeobox genes goosecoid and Xnot2 was isolated by differential screening. The chordin gene encodes a novel protein of 941 amino acids that has a signal sequence and four Cys-rich domains. The expression of chordin starts in Spemann's organizer subsequent to that of goosecoid, and its induction by activin requires de novo protein synthesis. Microinjection of chordin mRNA induces twinned axes and can completely rescue axial development in ventralized embryos. This molecule is a potent dorsalizing factor that is expressed at the right time and in the right place to regulate cell-cell interactions in the organizing centers of head, trunk, and tail development."

https://openalex.org/W2035502959,"The Pax5 gene, coding for the transcription factor BSAP, was mutated in the mouse germline by targeted disruption. Homozygous mutant mice were born alive, became growth retarded, and usually died within three weeks. About 5% of mutants survived to adulthood and were fertile, but severely runted. Morphogenesis of the posterior midbrain was affected as early as embryonic day 16.5, leading to a reduction of the inferior colliculus near the midline and to altered foliation of the anterior cerebellum. Moreover, all mutants failed to produce small pre-B, B, and plasma cells owing to a complete arrest of B cell development at an early precursor stage. These data define a key role for Pax5 in early B lymphopoiesis and midbrain patterning."
https://openalex.org/W2163584800,"E12 and E47 are two helix-loop-helix transcription factors that arise by alternative splicing of the E2A gene. Both have been implicated in the regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression. We have now generated E2A (−/−) mice by gene targeting. E2A-null mutant mice fail to generate mature B cells. The arrest of B cell development occurs at an early stage, since no immunoglobulin DJ rearrangements can be detected in homozygous mutant mice. While immunoglobulin germline Iμ RAG-1, mb-1, CD19, and λ5 transcripts are dramatically reduced in fetal livers of E2A (−/−) mice, B29 and μ° transcripts are present, but at lower levels. In addition, we show that Pax-5 transcripts are significantly reduced in fetal livers of E2A (−/−) mice. These data suggest a crucial role for E2A products as central regulators in early B cell differentiation."

The purified protein, named importin, promotes signal-dependent binding of karyophilic proteins to the nuclear envelope. We have cloned, sequenced, and expressed a corresponding cDNA. Importin shows 44% sequence identity with SRP1p, a protein associated with the yeast nuclear pore complex. Complete, signal-dependent import into HeLa nuclei can be reconstituted by combining importin purified from Xenopus eggs or expressed in E. coli with . Evidence for additional stimulatory factors is provided."

https://openalex.org/W2027971163,"We have used the interaction trap, a yeast two-hybrid system, to identify proteins interacting with hairy, a basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein that represses transcription during Drosophila embryonic segmentation. We find that the groucho (gro) protein binds specifically to hairy and also to hairy-related bHLH proteins encoded by deadpan and the Enhancer of split complex. The C-terminal WRPW motif present in all these bHLH proteins is essential for this interaction. We demonstrate that these associations reflect in vivo maternal requirements for gro during neurogenesis, segmentation, and sex determination, three processes regulated by the above bHLH proteins, and we propose that gro is a transcriptional corepressor recruited to specific target promoters by hairy-related bHLH proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2037670359,"Using proviral tagging in combination with in vitro selection for invasiveness, we have identified a gene, designated Tiam-1, that affects invasion. In the selected invasive T lymphoma variants, proviral insertions were found within coding exons of the Tiam-1 gene, resulting in both truncated 5'-end and 3'-end transcripts that give rise to N- and C-terminal Tiam-1 protein fragments. In one invasive variant, amplification of the Tiam-1 locus was observed with concomitant increase in the amount of normal Tiam-1 protein. Cell clones that were invasive in vitro produced experimental metastases in nude mice, and transfection of truncated Tiam-1 cDNAs into noninvasive cells made these cells invasive. The predicted Tiam-1 protein harbors a Dbl- and Pleckstrin-homologous domain, which it shares with GDP-GTP exchangers for Rho-like proteins that have been implicated in cytoskeletal organization."

Our data show that the N-terminus is extracellular, whereas the C-terminus is intracellular. Most importantly, we found only three transmembrane domains (designated TMD A, TMD B, and TMD C), which correspond to the previously proposed TMDs I, III, and IV, respectively. Contrary to earlier models, the putative channel-lining hydrophobic domain TMD II does not span the membrane, but either lies in close proximity to the intracellular face of the plasma membrane or loops into the membrane without traversing it. Furthermore, the region between TMDs III and IV, in previous models believed to be intracellular, is an entirely extracellular domain.

https://openalex.org/W2019365444,"Immunochemical studies have suggested a tight association of syntaxin with N-type calcium channels. Syntaxin specifically interacts with the fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic loop (LII-III) between homologous repeats II and III of the alpha 1 subunit of the class B N-type calcium channel (alpha 1B) from rat brain, but not with those of the class A Q-type (alpha 1A) or the class S L-type (alpha 1S) calcium channels. This interaction is mediated by an 87 amino acid sequence (773-859) containing two overlapping predicted helix-loop-helix domains. The 87 amino acid peptide can specifically block binding of native N-type calcium channels to syntaxin, indicating that this binding site is required for stable interaction of these two proteins. Interaction takes place with the C-terminal one-third of syntaxin (residues 181-288), which is thought to be anchored in the presynaptic plasma membrane. Our results suggest a direct interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of these two presynaptic membrane proteins that could have an important role in the targeting and docking of synaptic vesicles near N-type calcium channels, enabling tight structural and functional association of calcium entry sites and neurotransmitter release sites."
https://openalex.org/W2076782463,"Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a necessary component of the cellular machinery underlying learning and memory. Here, a constitutively active form of this enzyme, CaMKII(1-290), was introduced into neurons of hippocampal slices with a recombinant vaccinia virus to test the hypothesis that increased postsynaptic activity of this enzyme is sufficient to produce long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP), a prominent cellular model of learning and memory. Postsynaptic expression of CaMKII(1-290) increased CaMKII activity, enhanced synaptic transmission, and prevented more potentiation by an LTP-inducing protocol. These results, together with previous studies, suggest that postsynaptic CaMKII activity is necessary and sufficient to generate LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2036430534,"The β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) gene of the mouse was disrupted by inserting into exon 2 a cassette containing a neomycin resistance gene and a putative transcription termination sequence. Contrary to expectation, brain and other tissues from mice homozygous for the insertion still contained βAPP-specific RNA, albeit at a level 5- to 10-fold lower than wild type and lacking the disrupted exon, which had been spliced out. The brain contained shortened βAPP-specific protein at a low level. Mutant mice were severely impaired in spatial learning and exploratory behavior and showed increased incidence of agenesis of the corpus callosum."
https://openalex.org/W1995134733,"The three-dimensional structure of a Staphylococcus aureus superantigen, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), complexed with a human class II major histocompatibility molecule (DR1), was determined by x-ray crystallography. The TSST-1 binding site on DR1 overlaps that of the superantigen S. aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), but the two binding modes differ. Whereas SEB binds primarily off one edge of the peptide binding site of DR1, TSST-1 extends over almost one-half of the binding site and contacts both the flanking alpha helices of the histocompatibility antigen and the bound peptide. This difference suggests that the T cell receptor (TCR) would bind to TSST-1:DR1 very differently than to DR1:peptide or SEB:DR1. It also suggests that TSST-1 binding may be dependent on the peptide, though less so than TCR binding, providing a possible explanation for the inability of TSST-1 to competitively block SEB binding to all DR1 molecules on cells (even though the binding sites of TSST-1 and SEB on DR1 overlap almost completely) and suggesting the possibility that T cell activation by superantigen could be directed by peptide antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2095465583,"In the mammalian central nervous system, responsiveness to glucocorticoids is mediated by both the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). These pharmacologically distinct receptors are believed to bind to common response elements as homodimers. We provide evidence that MR and GR can form a heterodimeric complex with DNA-binding and transactivation properties different from those of the respective homodimers. There was a high degree of cooperativity of MR and GR in binding to a glucocorticoid response element. Transient transfection of a neuroblastoma cell line revealed a transcriptional response pattern of coexpressed MR and GR distinct from that obtained by MR or GR alone. Our findings demonstrate that heterodimerization of MR and GR is a hitherto unrecognized principle for the transcriptional regulation of glucocorticoid-responsive genes in tissue coexpressing these receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2141586765,"The ld proteins are inhibitors of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. In the B cell lineage, the Id1 and Id2 genes are expressed in pro-B cells and down-regulated during differentiation. To determine the role of bHLH proteins and the significance of down-regulation of Id genes in B cell development, transgenic mice constitutively expressing the Id1 gene were generated. Their phenotype suggests that B cell development is impaired at an early stage. Primarily, these mice have few B220+ IgM+ mature B or B220+ CD43− pre-B cells in the bone marrow, reduced frequencies of V(D)J and VKJK recombination of the immunoglobulin loci, and lower expression levels of the immunoglobulin, RAG-1, RAG-2, and λ5 genes."

https://openalex.org/W2038323867,"DNA is often bent when complexed with proteins. Understanding the forces responsible for DNA bending would be of fundamental value in exploring the interplay of these macromolecules. A series of experiments was devised to test the hypothesis that proteins with cationic surfaces can induce substantial DNA bending by neutralizing phosphates on one DNA face. Repulsions between phosphates in the remaining anionic helix are predicted to result in an unbalanced compression force acting to deform the DNA toward the protein. This hypothesis is supported by the results of electrophoretic experiments in which DNA spontaneously bends when one helical face is partially modified by incorporation of neutral phosphate analogs. Phasing with respect to a site of intrinsic DNA curvature (hexadeoxyadenylate tract) permits estimation of the electrostatic bend angle, and demonstrates that such modified DNAs are deformed toward the neutralized surface, as predicted. Similar model systems may be useful in exploring the extent to which phosphate neutralization can account for DNA bending by particular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2086652131,"Difficulties in neuronal transfection continue to restrict the applicability of molecular approaches to neurobiology. Conventional transfection techniques have been of limited effectiveness, particularly in intact neural tissues. Viral vectors effectively transfect neurons both in vitro and in vivo but are labor intensive to construct, difficult to control, and often compromise cell viability. We describe here an alternative strategy using particle-mediated gene transfer for the transfection of neurons and glia in intact brain slices. This approach is efficient, reliable, and does not require advanced molecular biological facilities for its application."

https://openalex.org/W1991905988,"Following postsynaptic activation of a pyramidal cell, the degree of GABAergic synaptic inhibition that the cell receives is reduced dramatically for many seconds. Previously, we found that induction of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) required post-synaptic increases in intracellular [Ca2+], but absence of a decrease in responsiveness to iontophoretically applied GABA left the mechanism of DSI expression uncertain. We investigated DSI with whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in rat hippocampal slices. Bath-applied carbachol was ordinarily used to increase the spontaneous action potential-induced IPSCs (sIPSCs) and enhance detectability of DSI; synaptically released ACh has the same effects. TTX-sensitive sIPSCs are markedly reduced by DSI, whereas TTX-insensitive miniature IPSC amplitudes do not change, suggesting that DSI represents a retrograde influence on presynaptic GABA release. A lag (approximately 1 s) prior to maximal DSI and prevention of DSI by pertussis toxin pointed to a G protein-linked second messenger that may be presynaptic, since perturbation of postsynaptic G protein function did not alter DSI."
https://openalex.org/W2082438131,"There is molecular diversity in both α1 and β subunits ofvoltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Coupling between voltage sensing and pore opening of the C-type αl (αlC) is im- proved by the type 2 β subunit (β2), and E-type α1β com- plexes inactivate at different rates depending on the na- ture of β. We compared the effects of type 1 and 2 β subunits on activation of the human E-type αl (αlE) with the effects they have on inactivation, as seen in Xenopus oocytes. The β subtypes stimulated activation in similar fashion but affected inactivation differently, and even in opposing directions. β subunits have a common central core but differ in their N- and C-termini and in a central region. N-terminal chimeras between β1 and β2 subunits that have opposing effects on inactivation resulted in the reciprocal transfer of their effects. We conclude that regulation of activation and inactivation of α1 by β are separable events and that the N-terminus of β is one of the structural determinants important in setting the rate and voltage at which an αl inactivates."
https://openalex.org/W2046872857,"At least four forms of synaptotagmin are expressed in neurons. Of these, synaptotagmin I has an essential function in mediating Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release at hippocampal synapses, but the functional implications of multiple synaptotagmins are unknown. Synaptotagmins I-III exhibit a strikingly differential distribution between synapses, with most neurons coexpressing either synaptotagmins I or II with III. Synaptotagmin IV is present uniformly throughout the brain at low levels. Synaptotagmins III and IV are both coexpressed with synaptotagmin I in hippocampal synapses, suggesting that these synaptotagmins are not functionally redundant. The first C2 domains of synaptotagmins I-III exhibit similar Ca2+ affinities in phospholipid-binding assays, whereas that of synaptotagmin IV is unable to bind Ca2+. All synaptotagmins tested bind the clathrin-adaptor protein AP-2 with high affinity. Our results suggest that different synaptotagmins serve distinct but overlapping functions in neuronal membrane traffic, with synaptotagmins I and II representing alternative Ca2+ sensors in exocytosis and all synaptotagmins functioning as AP-2 receptors in endocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1979431763,"The effect of protein kinase C (PKC) on rapid N-type inactivation of K+ channels has not been reported previously. We found that PKC specifically eliminates rapid inactivation of a cloned human A-type K+ channel (hKv3.4), converting this channel from a rapidly inactivating A type to a noninactivating delayed rectifier type. Biochemical analysis showed that the N-terminal domain of hKv3.4 is phosphorylated in vitro by PKC, and mutagenesis experiments revealed that two serines within the inactivation gate at the N-terminus are sites of direct PKC action. Moreover, mutating one of these serines to aspartic acid mimics the action of PKC. Serine phosphorylation may thus prevent rapid inactivation by shielding basic residues known to be critical to the function of the inactivation gate. The regulatory mechanism reported here may have substantial effects on signal coding in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1972747419,"Second messenger regulation of IRK1 (Kir2.1) inward rectifier K+ channels was investigated in giant inside-out patches from Xenopus oocytes. Kir2.1-mediated currents that run down completely within minutes upon excision of the patches could be partly restored by application of Mg-ATP together with <10 M free Mg2+ to the cytoplasmic side of the patch. As restoration could not be induced by the ATP analogs AMP-PNP or ATPS, this suggests an ATPase-like mechanism. In addition to ATP, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) induced an increase in current amplitude, which could, however, only be observed if channels were previously or subsequently stimulated by Mg-ATP and free Mg2+. This indicates that functional activity of Kir2.1 channels requires both phosphorylation by PKA and ATP hydrolysis. Moreover, currents could be down-regulated by N-heptyl-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, a specific stimulator of protein kinase C (PKC), suggesting that PKA and PKC mediate inverse effects on Kir2.1 channels. Regulation of Kir2.1 channels described here may be an important mechanism for regulation of excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2088164618,"A novel epigenetic mechanism that can affect minichromosome centromere function in vivo has been identified in S. pombe. This epigenetic system can result in the conversion of a nonfunctional centromere to a functional one without changes in the content, structural arrangement, or chemical modification state of the minichromosomal DNA. The conversion from a centromere-inactive to an active state, which is evident with minichromosomes carrying abbreviated centromeric DNA constructions, occurs with a relatively high frequency during mitotic cell divisions and readily provides an in vivo assay for proper centromere formation. The centromere-targeted epigenetic system supports a model for centromere function that involves specific de novo folding of centromeric components into a higher order chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2018934822,"We have examined the mechanisms controlling the induction of the two NGF receptors, trkA and p75, in proliferating neuroblasts immuno-isolated from thoracolumbar embryonic sympathetic ganglia. Contrary to prior studies, we find that induction of p75 follows rather than precedes that of trkA; this late induction is consistent with the fact that p75 functions at relatively late stages of sympathetic development. trkA induction is apparently not controlled by a cell-intrinsic mechanism. Rather, this receptor is induced by environmental signals including NT-3, which also acts as an interim survival factor for these neuroblasts, trkA induction by NT-3 is consequent to its promotion of mitotic arrest, as anti-mitotic drugs also efficiently induce trkA. p75 expression is induced in trkA-expressing cells by NGF. Thus, the development of sympathetic neurons involves sequential actions of different neurotrophins, which also regulate the expression of their own and each other's receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1975605595,"The S. cerevisiae gene MCR1 encodes two mitochondrial isoforms of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase. The primary translation product has an amino-terminal matrix-targeting signal, followed by a stretch of 21 uncharged amino acids. This precursor protein is inserted into the outer membrane, but only about one-third of the molecules become firmly anchored to the outer face of that membrane. The remaining molecules pass through the outer membrane into the inner membrane, are cleaved by inner membrane protease 1, and are released into the intermembrane space. Incomplete translocation arrest in the outer membrane is a novel mechanism by which the product of a single gene is sorted into different compartments of the same organelle."

We have used atomic force microscopy on the calyx-type nerve terminal of the chick ciliary ganglion to localize single calcium channels tagged via biotinylated ω-conotoxin GVIA to avidin-coated 30 nm gold particles. Calcium channels were in low (modal value approximately ⩽ 1 per μm2) and high (modal value55 per μm2) density areas and exhibited a prominent interchannel spacing of 40 nm, indicating an intermolecular linkage. Particles were observed in clusters and short linear or parallel linear arrays, groupings that may reflect calcium channel organization at the transmitter release site."

https://openalex.org/W1967763633,Miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were elicited from small numbers of release sites after brief microperfusion of Ba2+ and K+ onto proximal dendritic processes of hippocampal neurons in culture. Temporal summation of closely timed mEPSCs deviated significantly from linearity. The number of instances of closely timed mEPSCs that were also closely matched in terms of peak amplitudes was significantly greater than that expected by chance. Amplitude pairing became statistically more significant after prolongation of mEPSC duration and inhibition of glutamate receptor desensitization with cyclothiazide. These results are best explained by postsynaptic receptors that approach saturation after quantal release of transmitter.
https://openalex.org/W1966753073,"Multiple types of calcium channels are responsible for calcium influx that triggers transmitter release in the mammalian CNS. To test the contribution of each calcium channel type on synaptic modulation, we recorded calcium currents from somata of presynaptic interneurons and unitary glycinergic postsynaptic currents in the rat brainstem. In interneuron somata, A1 receptor activation inhibited predominantly N-type (omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive) and, to a lesser extent, P-type (omega-agatoxin IVA-sensitive) channels. At the presynaptic terminal, N- and P-type channels mediated synaptic transmission. omega-CgTx occluded synaptic inhibition by A1 receptor activation, suggesting that synaptic inhibition was mediated predominantly by N-type channel inhibition. A2 receptor activation facilitated synaptic transmission, probably through potentiation of P-type channels at the presynaptic terminal."
https://openalex.org/W1987689933,"Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase) has been implicated in neural plasticity that underlies learning and memory processes. Transformed strains of Drosophila, alI and al2, expressing a specific inhibitor of CaM kinase are known to be impaired in an associative conditioning behavioral paradigm. We found that these transformants had altered short-term plasticity in synaptic transmission along with abnormal nerve terminal sprouting and directionality of outgrowth. These results represent an interesting parallel with the activity-dependent regulation of synaptic physiology and morphology by the cAMP cascade in Aplysia and Drosophila. In contrast to the learning mutants dunce and rutabaga, which are defective in the cAMP cascade, inhibition of CaM kinase in al transformants caused increased sprouting at larval neuromuscular junctions near the nerve entry point, rather than altering the higher order branch segments. In addition, synaptic facilitation and potentiation were altered in a manner different from that observed in the cAMP mutants. Furthermore, synaptic currents in ala transformants were characterized by greater variability, suggesting an important role of CaM kinase in the stability of transmission."

Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) bind to the same region of human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-DR1 but do not compete with each other, which indicates that they bind to different subsets of DR1 molecules. Here, a mutation in the peptide-binding groove disrupted the SEB and TSST-1 binding sites, which suggests that peptides can influence the interaction with bacterial toxins. In support of this, the expression of the DR1 molecule in various cell types differentially affected the binding of these toxins."
https://openalex.org/W1983397972,"We show that the presence of a regulatory cis-acting element that flanks the core octamer site and dictates selectivity in the response to Vmw65 (VP16), while dispensable for POU binding per se, induces a conformational alteration in the nature of the POU domain in the DNA complex. A single substitution in the flanking signal distorts the POU complex and without affecting overall POU binding prevents Vmw65 interaction. Alternatively, substitution of a residue in the homeodomain predicted to contact the GARAT region prevents its recognition even on a wild-type motif, causing a reversion to the DNA binding pattern seen on a cellular motif and at the same time inefficient recognition by Vmw65. The results indicate that Vmw65 recognizes a particular POU domain conformation induced by the presence of the flanking GARAT region."
https://openalex.org/W2061800980,"Subcellular localization of neuronal mRNAs contributes to the development of identifiable microdomains. In differentiated neurons, tau mRNA is localized in the cell body and the proximal portion of the axon, and MAP2 mRNA is localized in the cell body and dendrites, whereas tubulin mRNA is restricted to the cell body. To investigate the mechanism(s) leading to segregation of mictrotubule-associated protein mRNA, we examined the role of the cytoskeleton in this process. Detergent extraction of primary neuronal cells in culture followed by in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that tau mRNA remains bound to cytoskeleton of the treated cells. In addition, biochemical fractionation showed that tau and MAP2 mRNAs are preferentially associated with the fraction of assembled microtubules. In contrast, mRNAs restricted to the neuronal cell body, such as those of tubulin, the 68 kDa neurofilament, and mouse GAPDH, are preferentially found in the supernatant. Using cytoskeletal inhibitors, we demonstrate that tau mRNA is associated with the microtubule system, and not with the actin filaments, thus supporting the hypothesis that the mechanism of mRNA localization is a multistep pathway in which the microtubules play a crucial role."

Enhancement of GABAR currents by PKM was again obtained. PKM increased GABAR currents at high (>10 μM) but not at low (>10 μM) GABA concentrations, resulting in increases in both EC50 and maximal GABAR current.

Chimeric proteins that contain the Drosophila C/EBP (DmC/EBP) basic region, a heterologous zipper, and a heterologous activation domain could functionally substitute for DmC/EBP. Mammalian C/EBPs were also functional in Drosophila. In contrast, 9 of 25 single amino acid substitutions in the basic region disrupted biological function.

https://openalex.org/W1991667322,"Epithelial calcium action potentials in Obelia geniculata trigger brief light flashes from specialized cells by direct activation of cytoplasmic calcium-activated photoprotein obelin. During a series of action potentials, sequential flashes undergo characteristic facilitation and decrement with no change in associated spike waveform. Analysis of the subcellular light distribution shows that facilitation results from two processes: recruitment of calcium entry sites and increased light from previously responding localized sites. We propose a model that accounts for the localized flash facilitation and decrement observed in vivo and is based upon the kinetics of calcium binding and emission of obelin. In this model, obelin emits light only when three calcium ions are bound. Changes in flash intensity during successive action potentials result from calcium bound persistently to unexpended obelin, effectively lowering the number of calcium ions required for subsequent activation. Accordingly, facilitation or decrement results from the time-dependent availability of singly and doubly bound obelin."
