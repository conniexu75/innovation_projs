https://openalex.org/W2150258239,"We examined the number of tropical cyclones and cyclone days as well as tropical cyclone intensity over the past 35 years, in an environment of increasing sea surface temperature. A large increase was seen in the number and proportion of hurricanes reaching categories 4 and 5. The largest increase occurred in the North Pacific, Indian, and Southwest Pacific Oceans, and the smallest percentage increase occurred in the North Atlantic Ocean. These increases have taken place while the number of cyclones and cyclone days has decreased in all basins except the North Atlantic during the past decade."

To detect interacting pairs of human proteins systematically, a protein matrix of 4456 baits and 5632 preys was screened by automated yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction mating. We identified 3186 mostly novel interactions among 1705 proteins, resulting in a large, highly connected network. Independent pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays validated the overall quality of the Y2H interactions. Using topological and GO criteria, a scoring system was developed to define 911 high-confidence interactions among 401 proteins. Furthermore, the network was searched for interactions linking uncharacterized gene products and human disease proteins to regulatory cellular pathways. Two novel Axin-1 interactions were validated experimentally, characterizing ANP32A and CRMP1 as modulators of Wnt signaling. Systematic human protein interaction screens can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of protein function and cellular processes."

A defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) on S mediates this interaction. The crystal structure at 2.9 angstrom resolution of the RBD bound with the peptidase domain of human ACE2 shows that the RBD presents a gently concave surface, which cradles the N-terminal lobe of the peptidase. The atomic details at the interface between the two proteins clarify the importance of residue changes that facilitate efficient cross-species infection and human-to-human transmission. The structure of the RBD suggests ways to make truncated disulfide-stabilized RBD variants for use in the design of coronavirus vaccines."

By using a combination of improved low- and high-resolution conformational sampling methods, improved atomically detailed potential functions that capture the jigsaw puzzle–like packing of protein cores, and high-performance computing, high-resolution structure prediction (&lt;1.5 angstroms) can be achieved for small protein domains (&lt;85 residues). The primary bottleneck to consistent high-resolution prediction appears to be conformational sampling."
https://openalex.org/W2050168384,"During the past decade, record-high salinities have been observed in the Atlantic Inflow to the Nordic Seas and the Arctic Ocean, which feeds the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC). This may counteract the observed long-term increase in freshwater supply to the area and tend to stabilize the North Atlantic THC. Here we show that the salinity of the Atlantic Inflow is tightly linked to the dynamics of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre circulation. Therefore, when assessing the future of the North Atlantic THC, it is essential that the dynamics of the subpolar gyre and its influence on the salinity are taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W1992282800,"The activation dynamics of the transcription factor NF-kappaB exhibit damped oscillatory behavior when cells are stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) but stable behavior when stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS binding to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) causes activation of NF-kappaB that requires two downstream pathways, each of which when isolated exhibits damped oscillatory behavior. Computational modeling of the two TLR4-dependent signaling pathways suggests that one pathway requires a time delay to establish early anti-phase activation of NF-kappaB by the two pathways. The MyD88-independent pathway required Inferon regulatory factor 3-dependent expression of TNFalpha to activate NF-kappaB, and the time required for TNFalpha synthesis established the delay."
https://openalex.org/W2119665774,"Oxidative stress and mutagenic DNA lesions formed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) are linked to human malignancy. Clinical treatments inducing chronic oxidative stress may therefore carry a risk of therapy-related cancer. We suggest that immunosuppression by azathioprine (Aza) may be one such treatment. Aza causes the accumulation of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) in patients' DNA. Here we demonstrate that biologically relevant doses of ultraviolet A (UVA) generate ROS in cultured cells with 6-TG–substituted DNA and that 6-TG and UVA are synergistically mutagenic. A replication-blocking DNA 6-TG photoproduct, guanine sulfonate, was bypassed by error-prone, Y-family DNA polymerases in vitro. A preliminary analysis revealed that in five of five cases, Aza treatment was associated with a selective UVA photosensitivity. These findings may partly explain the prevalence of skin cancer in long-term survivors of organ transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2074097004,"A small number of mammalian signaling pathways mediate a myriad of distinct physiological responses to diverse cellular stimuli. Temporal control of the signaling module that contains IκB kinase (IKK), its substrate inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB), and the key inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB can allow for selective gene activation. We have demonstrated that different inflammatory stimuli induce distinct IKK profiles, and we examined the underlying molecular mechanisms. Although tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced IKK activity was rapidly attenuated by negative feedback, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling and LPS-specific gene expression programs were dependent on a cytokine-mediated positive feedback mechanism. Thus, the distinct biological responses to LPS and TNFα depend on signaling pathway-specific mechanisms that regulate the temporal profile of IKK activity."

Old craters from a unique period of heavy bombardment that ended ∼3.8 billion years ago were made by asteroids that were dynamically ejected from the main asteroid belt, possibly due to the orbital migration of the giant planets. The impactors of the past ∼3.8 billion years have a size distribution quite different from that of the main belt asteroids but very similar to that of near-Earth asteroids."

The observed correlation function for a thermal cloud shows a bunching behavior, while the correlation is flat for a coherent sample. These quantum correlations are the atomic analogue of the Hanbury Brown Twiss effect. We observe the effect in three dimensions and study its dependence on cloud size."
https://openalex.org/W2057990359,"Molecular dynamics simulations of nanocrystalline copper under shock loading show an unexpected ultrahigh strength behind the shock front, with values up to twice those at low pressure. Partial and perfect dislocations, twinning, and debris from dislocation interactions are found behind the shock front. Results are interpreted in terms of the pressure dependence of both deformation mechanisms active at these grain sizes, namely dislocation-based plasticity and grain boundary sliding. These simulations, together with new shock experiments on nanocrystalline nickel, raise the possibility of achieving ultrahard materials during and after shock loading."
https://openalex.org/W2066060929,"Activation of macrophages is important in chronic inflammatory disease states such as atherosclerosis. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or tumor necrosis factor-α can promote macrophage activation. Conversely, anti-inflammatory factors such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) can decrease proinflammatory activation. The molecular mediators regulating the balance of these opposing effectors remain incompletely understood. Herein, we identify Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) as being markedly induced in response to IFN-γ, LPS, or tumor necrosis factor-α and decreased by TGF-β1 in macrophages. Overexpression of KLF4 in J774a macrophages induced the macrophage activation marker inducible nitric-oxide synthase and inhibited the TGF-β1 and Smad3 target gene plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Conversely, KLF4 knockdown markedly attenuated the ability of IFN-γ, LPS, or IFN-γ plus LPS to induce the iNOS promoter, whereas it augmented macrophage responsiveness to TGF-β1 and Smad3 signaling. The KLF4 induction of the iNOS promoter is mediated by two KLF DNA-binding sites at –95 and –212 bp, and mutation of these sites diminished induction by IFN-γ and LPS. We further provide evidence that KLF4 interacts with the NF-κB family member p65 (RelA) to cooperatively induce the iNOS promoter. In contrast, KLF4 inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad3 induction of the PAI-1 promoter independent of KLF4 DNA binding through a novel antagonistic competition with Smad3 for the C terminus of the coactivator p300/CBP. These findings support an important role for KLF4 as a regulator of key signaling pathways that control macrophage activation.

These findings support an important role for KLF4 as a regulator of key signaling pathways that control macrophage activation. Macrophage activation is an integral process in the development of atherosclerosis as well as a number of other chronic inflammatory diseases such as emphysema, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, arthritis, and pancreatitis. Once within the site of inflammation, macrophages elaborate a broad range of cytokines, growth factors, and proteolytic enzymes that may participate in the damage and repair that ensues. Identification of mechanisms that may regulate macrophage activation is, thus, of considerable interest. One of the key events in macrophage response to proinflammatory stimuli is the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) 2The abbreviations used are: iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein; IFN, interferon; NK, natural killer; KLF, Kruppel-like factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MOI, multiplicity of infection; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; EV, empty vector; AS-KLF4, antisense KLF4; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1.2The abbreviations used are: iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein; IFN, interferon; NK, natural killer; KLF, Kruppel-like factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MOI, multiplicity of infection; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; EV, empty vector; AS-KLF4, antisense KLF4; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1. and the formation of nitric oxide, an important mediator involved in many host defense actions in macrophages. However, increased amounts of leukocyte-derived nitric oxide can be detrimental by promoting tissue damage in a variety of inflammatory disease states (1.MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar, 2.Koh K.P. Wang Y. Yi T. Shiao S.L. Lorber M.I. Sessa W.C. Tellides G. Pober J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Given the importance of iNOS in a variety of pathophysiological conditions, control of its expression has been the subject of considerable investigation (1.MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). Indeed, several studies have shown that induction or inhibition of iNOS in macrophages by pro- or anti-inflammatory stimuli, respectively, can occur at the level of transcription. For example, proinflammatory stimuli such as LPS or IFN-γ involve activation of NF-κB or interferon-responsive elements, respectively, on the mouse iNOS promoter, whereas anti-inflammatory mediators such as TGF-β1 can inhibit proinflammatory stimuli by coactivator competition (3.Feinberg M.W. Shimizu K. Lebedeva M. Haspel R. Takayama K. Chen Z. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Simon D.I. Libby P. Mitchell R.N. Jain M.K. Circ.

Thus, identification of factors that alter such signaling pathways and, in turn, iNOS expression may offer novel strategies to regulate the inflammatory response in macrophages and diverse inflammatory disease states. TGF-β1 is a pleiotropic growth factor with potent immunomodulating cellular effects. For example, both experimental and clinical data support a role for TGF-β1 as a regulator of immune responses in the development of atherosclerosis. The observation that patients with advanced atherosclerosis have significantly reduced levels of active TGF-β1 by comparison with patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries supports a role for TGF-β1 in atherogenesis (5.McCaffrey T.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Low levels of TGF-β1 may result in an excessive inflammatory milieu accelerating atherogenesis (6.Grainger D.J. Kemp P.R. Metcalfe J.C. Liu A.C. Lawn R.M. Williams N.R. Grace A.A. Schofield P.M. Chauhan A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibition of endogenous TGF-β1 signaling in mice accelerated atherosclerotic lesion formation characterized by increased macrophages and T cells and decreased collagen content (7.Lutgens E. Gijbels M. Smook M. Heeringa P. Gotwals P. Koteliansky V. Daemen M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 8.Mallat Z. Gojova A. Marchiol-Fournigault C. Esposito B. Kamate C. Merval R. Fradelizi D. Tedgui A. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Cellular signaling through the TGF-β superfamily occurs via intracellular mediators, termed Smads, which translocate to the nucleus, where they direct transcriptional responses. Three classes of Smads (pathway-restricted, common, and inhibitory) are responsible for propagating the downstream signaling effects. TGF-β/activin receptors phosphorylate the pathway-restricted Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, whereas bone morphogenic protein receptors activate Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. Pathway-restricted Smads may hetero-oligomerize with the only common Smad, Smad4, before translocating to the nucleus. The inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, are structurally divergent from other Smads and function to block TGF-β signaling by preventing ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation of pathway-restricted Smads. We have previously identified a critical role for Smad3 in suppressing macrophage markers of inflammation such as iNOS, matrix metalloelastase (MMP)-12, and chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (3.Feinberg M.W. Shimizu K. Lebedeva M. Haspel R. Takayama K. Chen Z. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Simon D.I. Libby P. Mitchell R.N. Jain M.K. Circ.

We have also shown that cardiac allografts transplanted into Smad3-deficient mice develop accelerated intimal hyperplasia with increased infiltration of macrophages in vivo (3.Feinberg M.W. Shimizu K. Lebedeva M. Haspel R. Takayama K. Chen Z. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Simon D.I. Libby P. Mitchell R.N. Jain M.K. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, perturbation of TGF-β1 and/or Smad3 signaling may significantly regulate vascular inflammation. Interferon (IFN)-γ is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by a number of cell types found within the atherosclerotic lesion, including macrophages, T cells (Th1 helper cells), and natural killer (NK) cells. In response to IFN-γ, macrophages express HLA-DR, which allows them to present antigens to T lymphocytes and amplify the inflammatory response (10.Libby P. Pober J.S. Immunity. 2001; 14: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 11.Nathan C.F. Murray H.W. Wiebe M.E. Rubin B.Y. J. Exp.

Consequently, IFN-γ is a potent proinflammatory mediator in a variety of vascular inflammatory disease states. For example, both clinical and experimental studies support a role for IFN-γ in promoting atherosclerotic lesion formation and transplantation arteriosclerosis (15.Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6841) Google Scholar, 16.Ueland T. Sikkeland L.I. Yndestad A. Eiken H.G. Holm T. Guevara C. Haug T. Endresen K. Froland S.S. Gullestad L.

In animal atherosclerotic models, exogenous administration of IFN-γ accelerates atherosclerosis and is associated with an unstable plaque phenotype (17.Whitman S.C. Ravisankar P. Elam H. Daugherty A.

In most cells, IFN-γ signals through the Jak-Stat pathway to induce transcriptional responses (23.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar, 24.Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In response to IFN-γ, receptor-bound Stat1α becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus as a homodimer, where it may bind directly to palindromic γ-activated sites of IFN-γ target gene promoters or with other interacting proteins. In addition to mediating downstream proinflammatory effects, Stat1α is also capable of inhibiting anti-inflammatory signaling pathways such as TGF-β1. Thus, downstream targets of Stat1α may also be important for carrying out this dual role. Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) are a subclass of the zinc finger family of transcription factors characterized by the DNA binding domain containing the conserved sequence CX2CX3FX5LX2HX3H (underlined cysteine and histidine residues coordinate zinc). The three zinc fingers are usually found at the C terminus of the protein and bind to either a CACCC element or GC-box. The N terminus is involved in transcriptional activation and/or repression as well as protein-protein interaction (25.Bieker J.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26.Bieker J.J. J. Biol.

Med. 2004; 14: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies demonstrated that KLF proteins typically regulate critical aspects of cellular development, differentiation, and activation. For example, KLF1 (EKL erythroid Kruppel-like factor) has been shown to be essential in red blood cell maturation, and KLF2 (LKLF; lung Kruppel-like factor) is thought to play an important role in programming the quiescent phenotype of single-positive T cells (28.Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 29.Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1986-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). KLF4 (GKLF; gut Kruppel-like factor) was first identified in the epithelial lining of the gut and skin, and subsequent studies have shown it to play a role in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation in these tissues (30.Segre J.A. Bauer C. Fuchs E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 31.Katz J.P. Perreault N. Goldstein B.G. Lee C.S. Labosky P.A. Yang V.W. Kaestner K.H. Development. 2002; 129: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies suggest that KLF4 is also an IFN-γ target gene in colonic carcinoma cell lines, an effect mediated by Stat1α binding to a γ-activated site element of the KLF4 promoter (32.Chen Z.Y. Shie J.L. Tseng C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 281: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, Noti et al. (33.Noti J.D. Johnson A.K. Dillon J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3449-3457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) found that KLF4 can regulate the macrophage differentiation marker CD11d. However, a role for KLF4 in regulating macrophage activation remains unknown. In this report, we identified KLF4 in macrophages as being induced by proinflammatory stimuli such as IFN-γ, LPS, and TNF-α and inhibited by the anti-inflammatory growth factor, TGF-β1. Our studies demonstrate that KLF4 plays a key role in mediating the proinflammatory effects by IFN-γ or LPS on the induction of the macrophage activation marker iNOS, an effect mediated, in part, through a novel interaction with p65 (RelA), a member of the NF-κB family of transcription factors. In contrast, KLF4 inhibits TGF-β1/Smad3 function by competing with Smad3 for the C terminus of the coactivator p300. These findings demonstrate that KLF4 plays a critical role in mediating proinflammatory responses in macrophages and may be an important target for modulating TGF-β1/Smad3 effects. Cell Culture and Reagents—J774a, THP-1, and RAW264.7 cells were grown as recommended (American Type Culture Collection).

Immunoblots were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies for KLF4 (active motif), Smad3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-Smad3 (kindly provided by A. Moustakas, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Sweden), or IgG1 control antibody (Sigma) and were detected using horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence. For immunoprecipitation assays, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids and harvested with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer 48 h later. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 4 μg of α-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as previously described (3.Feinberg M.W. Shimizu K. Lebedeva M. Haspel R. Takayama K. Chen Z. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Simon D.I.

PAI-1 and Nitrite Measurements—PAI-1 secretion was measured by ELISA according to the recommendation of the manufacturer (American Diagnostica). The generation of nitrite was used as an indicator of NO release by J774a cells and measured by the Griess reaction according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). Briefly, the medium was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The nitrite content in the supernatant was measured by incubating medium with Griess reagent (sulfanilamide and N-1-napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride) under acidic (phosphoric acid) conditions. The concentration of the resultant chromophore was determined spectrometrically at 540 nm and calculated from a sodium nitrite standard reference curve. Transient Transfections—RAW264.7 cells were transfected with Fugene™6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described (3.Feinberg M.W. Shimizu K. Lebedeva M. Haspel R. Takayama K. Chen Z.

The total amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant within each experiment. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity (to correct for differences in transfection efficiency) by cotransfecting the pCMV-βgal plasmid in all experiments. All transfections were performed in triplicate from at least three independent experiments.

Bomsztyk (University of Washington), and pPAC-p50 and pPAC-p65 were kindly provided by M. Perrella (Harvard Medical School). Adenoviral and Retroviral Infections—Adenoviral constructs for KLF4 or empty virus control both encode green fluorescent protein (GFP) and were generated by the Harvard Gene Therapy Group. The GFP and KLF4 are expressed as separate proteins driven by a bidirectional cytomegalovirus promoter. For adenoviral infection of J774a cells, cells were seeded at 2 × 106/10-cm2 dish, infected with the adenoviral vectors at 200–1000 multiplicity of infection (MOI), and incubated overnight or as indicated in the presence of IFN-γ. Transduction efficiencies were typically 60–70% as measured by GFP positivity and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses. For retroviral studies, the indicated cDNA was cloned into the retroviral vector green fluorescent protein-RV (gift K. Murphy), and retroviruses were generated as described (35.Ranganath S. Ouyang W.

Transduction efficiencies were typically >95% as measured by GFP positivity and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. KLF4 Knockdown Experiments—Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides were generated to the KLF4 mRNA (AS-KLF, 5′-ACAGCCATGTCAGACTCGCCAGGTG-3′) and prepared as described by the manufacturer (GeneTools, Philomath, OR). A standard control morpholino oligonucleotide (nonspecific control) was used as a negative control and has been described elsewhere, GeneTools (NS, 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′, GeneTools). Briefly, cells were transfected with the ethoxylated polyethyleneimine reagent and AS-KLF4 or nonspecific control morpholino oligonucleotides at equimolar concentrations (1.4 μm) at room temperature for 20 min in serum-free conditions. After 3 h, cells were replaced with medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, transient transfection of the indicated plasmids was performed. Generation of Glutathione S-Transferase Fusion Protein and Pull-down Assays—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein for KLF4 was generated using the pGEX-4T-1 vector according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously by incubating whole cell extract from 293T cells expressing full-length KLF4 or pcDNA3 (37.SenBanerjee S. Lin Z. Atkins G.B. Greif D.M.

Radiolabeled DNA probes were generated to the Smad binding element at positions –688 to –660 bp of the PAI-1 promoter as doublestranded oligonucleotides. Supershift antibodies for Smad3 (sc-8332), FLAG, or IgG1 were incubated with nuclear extracts for 1 h at 4 °C prior to adding the radiolabeled oligonucleotide (38.Dennler S. Itoh S.

However, few molecular examples are available for study owing to the difficulties in synthesis. Recent advances in organoactinide chemistry have provided a route to uranium nitride complexes that expands the options for developing UN chemistry. Several 24-membered uranium nitrogen rings, (UNUN3)4, have been synthesized by reduction of sodium azide with organometallic metallocene derivatives, [(C5Me4R)2U][(mu-Ph)2BPh2] (R = Me, H; Me = methyl, Ph = phenyl). The nanometer-sized rings contain unusual UNU nitride linkages that have short U-N distances within the double-bond range."

The abundance ratio for ethane was significantly higher after impact, whereas those for methanol and hydrogen cyanide were unchanged. The abundance ratios in the ejecta are similar to those for most Oort cloud comets, but methanol and acetylene are lower in Tempel 1 by a factor of about 2. These results suggest that the volatile ices in Tempel 1 and in most Oort cloud comets originated in a common region of the protoplanetary disk."
https://openalex.org/W2131765423,"In plants, cysteine biosynthesis plays a central role in fixing inorganic sulfur from the environment and provides the only metabolic sulfide donor for the generation of methionine, glutathione, phytochelatins, iron-sulfur clusters, vitamin cofactors, and multiple secondary metabolites. O-Acetylserine sulfhydrylase (OASS) catalyzes the final step of cysteine biosynthesis, the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent conversion of O-acetylserine into cysteine. Here we describe the 2.2 A resolution crystal structure of OASS from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtOASS) and the 2.7 A resolution structure of the AtOASS K46A mutant with PLP and methionine covalently linked as an external aldimine in the active site. Although the plant and bacterial OASS share a conserved set of amino acids for PLP binding, the structure of AtOASS reveals a difference from the bacterial enzyme in the positioning of an active site loop formed by residues 74-78 when methionine is bound. Site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic analysis, and ligand binding titrations probed the functional roles of active site residues. These experiments indicate that Asn77 and Gln147 are key amino acids for O-acetylserine binding and that Thr74 and Ser75 are involved in sulfur incorporation into cysteine. In addition, examination of the AtOASS structure and nearly 300 plant and bacterial OASS sequences suggest that the highly conserved β8A-β9A surface loop may be important for interaction with serine acetyltransferase, the other enzyme in cysteine biosynthesis. Initial protein-protein interaction experiments using AtOASS mutants targeted to this loop support this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2028507800,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a homologue of angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE), the central enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 is abundant in human kidney and heart and has been implicated in renal and cardiac function through its ability to hydrolyze Angiotensin II. Although ACE2 and ACE are both type I integral membrane proteins and share 61% protein sequence similarity, they display distinct modes of enzyme action and tissue distribution. This study characterized ACE2 at the plasma membrane of non-polarized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) epithelial cells and compared its cellular localization to its related enzyme, ACE, using indirect immunofluorescence, cell-surface biotinylation, Western analysis, and enzyme activity assays. This study shows ACE2 and ACE are both cell-surface proteins distributed evenly to detergent-soluble regions of the plasma membrane in CHO cells. However, in polarized MDCKII cells under steady-state conditions the two enzymes are differentially expressed. ACE2 is localized predominantly to the apical surface (∼92%) where it is proteolytically cleaved within its ectodomain to release a soluble form. Comparatively, ACE is present on both the apical (∼55%) and basolateral membranes (∼45%) where it is also secreted but differentially; the ectodomain cleavage of ACE is 2.5-fold greater from the apical surface than the basolateral surface. These studies suggest that both ACE2 and ACE are ectoenzymes that have distinct localization and secretion patterns that determine their role on the cell surface in kidney epithelium and in urine.

Brosnihan K.B. Ferrario C.M. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 970-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) all suggest that an up-regulation of ACE2 contributes to heart failure and ventricular remodeling. Furthermore, ace2-/y knock-out mice exhibit severe defects in cardiac contractility, which are restored by concomitant ACE ablation (10Crackower M.A. Sarao R. Oudit G.Y. Yagil C. Kozieradzki I.

These findings support the concept that ACE2 acts in a counter-regulatory manner to ACE and may play an important role to modulate the balance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators in the kidney and heart. More recently, ACE2 has gained considerable attention as being a receptor for the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (15Li W. Moore M.J. Vasilieva N. Sui J. Wong S.K.

Although enormous focus has been placed on identifying and understanding the precise physiological roles for ACE2 in normal and disease states, the knowledge of the basic cell biology of ACE2 remains rudimentary. Specifically, there are no reports of the cellular targeting or sorting of ACE2 or ACE in polarized cells. Hence, the initial objective of this present study was to identify a human cell line of high endogenous ACE2 expression for cell biology studies. Following this our next approach was to employ Madin-Darby canine kidney type II (MDCKII) cells, a widely used polarized epithelial cell host for the expression and targeting of heterologous proteins. One of the highest areas of ACE2 and ACE expression is the kidney (2Tipnis S.R. Hooper N.M. Hyde R. Karran E. Christie G. Turner A.J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). MDCKII cells in culture retain many differentiated properties characteristic of kidney epithelium and, therefore, present an applicable cell line in which to study both ACE2 and ACE. Thus, the present study has investigated the cellular localization and cell fate of ACE2 in comparison with ACE, an analogous protein to ACE2 both in sequence and membrane topology, in non-polarized Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and polarized MDCKII cells. Furthermore, establishing an in vitro model of ACE2 and ACE expression in stably transfected polarized MDCKII cells provides a useful model to study the possible mechanisms regulating the cell fate and steady-state distribution of ACE2 and ACE in kidney epithelium.

Total RNA was isolated from human cells using TRIzol (GE Biosciences). cDNA was generated using ace2 gene-specific primers and then amplified by PCR using the same primers (forward: 5′-GCTTCAGCTGCAGGCTCTTCAGC-3′; reverse: 3′-GCAAATCAGCAGGGAGGCATCC-5′). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (internal control) was amplified from each cell line using specific primers (forward: 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′; reverse: 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′). The products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing (Lark Technologies). Preparation of Cell Membranes—Confluent cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from culture flasks into 50 mm Hepes containing 20 mm CaCl2 and EDTA-free inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, pH 7.5). Cells were lysed using a Parr cell disruption bomb using N2 (800 p.s.i. at 4 °C) for 10 min, and the lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant membrane pellet was resuspended in enzyme buffer (50 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2 (pH 6.8), and 1% Triton (v/v) X-100). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Quenched Fluorescent Substrate Activity Assays—The activities of ACE2 and/or ACE in cell membrane preparations generated from human cell lines, the media from secretion studies, and human urine were determined as the breakdown of 50 μm fluorogenic substrate (ACE2, ((7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Ala-Pro-Lys-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-OH or ACE, ((7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Ala-Ser-Asp-Lys-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropionyl)), by either 50 μg of total protein of cell membrane preparation, 50 μg of total protein of media, or 50 μl of urine. All experiments were performed as described previously (4Vickers C. Hales P. Kaushik V. Dick L. Gavin J. Tang J. Godbout K. Parsons T. Baronas E. Hsieh F. Acton S. Patane M. Nichols A. Tummino P.

Soc. 2002; 124: 11852-11853Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) for ACE2, and 10 μm captopril or ramipril for ACE. Purified soluble ACE2 (R & D Systems) or purified pig ACE was used to determine the amount of fluorescence generated per nanogram of substrate hydrolyzed per milligram of protein. Human urine analyzed for ACE2 specific activity was collected from 6 normal patients of both genders, aged 23-55 years, that were not suffering hypertension, renal complication, or any related disorder. cDNA Constructs—The cDNA corresponding to the full-length ACE2 coding sequence was isolated from a kidney cDNA library, amplified by PCR, and subcloned into the XbaI/XhoI sites of the pCINeo mammalian expression vector (Promega). The cDNA encoding full-length human somatic ace was a gift from Prof. P. Corvol (INSERM, Paris, France) and subcloned into pIRESNeo (Clontech Laboratories Inc.) (20Parkin E.T. Tan F. Skidgel R.A. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3079-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Expression of ACE2 and ACE in CHO and MDCKII Cells—All transient transfections were performed as previously described (2Tipnis S.R. Hooper N.M. Hyde R. Karran E. Christie G. Turner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33238-33243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). To establish stable expression, cells were split at a ratio of 1:50 72 h after the start of transfection and selected for using G418 (CHO, 1 mg ml-1; MDCKII, 0.5 mg ml-1). FACScan with CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences) was employed to differentiate MDCKII cells of high or low protein expression levels and normal morphology as previously described (21Lanctôt C. Fournier H. Howell S. Boileau G. Crine P. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The transepithelial electrical resistance of MDCKII monolayers grown on Transwell filters (Corning Costar, 3412 and 3460, pore size 0.4 μm) for biotinylation and immunofluorescence studies was measured using a Millicell-ERS Voltohmmeter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to assess the integrity of tight junctions. All experiments were performed at an electrical resistance of >200 Ω cm-2. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE by using 6% or 7-17% gradient polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in a Tris-glycine buffer with 10% (v/v) methanol and 0.04% (w/v) SDS. The membrane was saturated with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 10% (w/v) nonfat milk for 1 h at 37 °C, then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Biosciences) were used at 1:4,000, and bound antibodies were detected by using a enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Biosciences). Enzymatic Deglycosylation—N-Glycosidase F deglycosylation of cell membrane preparations was performed according to the supplier's instructions (New England BioLabs, Inc.). Cell-surface Biotinylation of Non-polarized Cells—All stages of the procedure were performed at 4 °C and as previously described (22Barnes K. Brown C. Turner A.J. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2). Cells were biotinylated using 5 ml of 2 mg/ml biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester constituted in 40 mm bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.6) for 30 min. Cells were subsequently lysed with 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (pH 8.0) consisting of 50 mm, Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (v/v) deoxycholic acid, 0.1% (v/v) SDS, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The collected lysate (1 mg/ml) was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to pellet debris, and the pellet was retained for analysis. The clear lysate was rotated for 2 h with 200 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads suspended in 0.01 m NaPO4, 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.2). The beads were recovered by centrifugation for 1 min at 10,000 × g and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline using rotation and centrifugation. Samples were prepared for immunoblotting by resuspending the pellet and streptavidin-agarose beads in 4× Laemmli sample buffer or by precipitating the supernatant containing cytosolic proteins with 10% (w/v in acetone) trichloroacetic acid on ice, sedimenting by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000 × g, washing twice with acetone, and resuspending in 4× Laemmli sample buffer. Cell-surface Biotinylation of Polarized Cells Grown on Transwell Filters—Biotinylation was performed as described above, using biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester constituted in 40 mm bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.5). Cells were grown on polycarbonate Transwell filters (Costar 3412), and biotin was added to either the apical or basolateral, or both compartments. The opposite compartment (without biotin) was filled with phosphate-buffered saline and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Cells were subsequently lysed and biotinylated protein was affinity-precipitated as described above. The biotinylated proteins were eluted from beads using 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. Uptake Studies—Biotinylation studies were performed as previously described (22Barnes K. Brown C. Turner A.J. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using membrane-impermeable, thiol-cleavable EZ-link-NHS-SS-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate, Pierce). To allow re-internalization, cells were incubated with complete medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C for various times. Cells were washed three times for 15 min each with glutathione buffer (50 mm glutathione (reduced), 90 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 8.6). Cells were lysed and the biotin-labeled protein affinity-precipitated as described in the section above. Protein levels were quantified by densitometry (Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-1000 plus and Imaging Reader version 2.3 software, Fuji Photofilm Co. Ltd.). Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—Transfected CHO cells expressing full-length ACE2 or ACE were cultured on glass coverslips overnight prior to fixation using 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactive aldehyde groups were quenched by 50 mm NH4Cl for 15 min at 25 °C, and cells were permeabilized using Triton X-100 for 5 min at 25 °C. Nonspecific binding was blocked using 0."

A shift in helix register following A30P disturbs the canonical succession of polar and hydrophobic residues for at least two turns. The shortened helix-N adopts a slightly higher helical content and is less bent, indicating that strain was present in the micelle-bound helix. In the vicinity of the A30P-induced perturbations, the underlying micelle environment has rearranged, but nevertheless all aS variants maintain similar interrelationships with the micelle.

Of course, it is exceedingly difficult to comprehensively address PD pathogenesis and the current study merely characterizes the effects of the A30P and A53T substitutions on the structure and dynamics of wild-type aS when bound to micelles. As the here-employed solution NMR spectroscopy is limited by particle size, only micelle- rather than vesicle-bound aS can be studied. However, both A30P and A53T mutations lie within the two helices of micelle-bound aS that bear close structural resemblance to the vesicle-bound state (20Ulmer T.S. Bax A. Cole N.B. Nussbaum R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9595-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), and the reported results are therefore expected to be relevant for the vesicle-bound state, too. Indeed, the vesicle-binding properties of the PD variants are readily rationalized by our findings. Examination of altered protein-micelle interactions between the different aS variants as well as delineation of their immersion into the micelle provides additional information on the effect of these mutations at the molecular level.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Production—The human α-synuclein variants A30P and A53T were expressed from the kanamycin-restricted, T7lac-promoter-controlled pET-41 vector (Novagen) in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. M9 minimal medium (39Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A2.1Google Scholar) cultures, containing 2H, 13C, and 15N enriched precursors, were grown, and the aS variants were purified to >98% purity as described for wild-type aS (20Ulmer T.S. Bax A. Cole N.B. Nussbaum R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9595-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar).NMR Sample Preparation—Unless stated otherwise, all samples were prepared in H2O to contain aS at a concentration of 0.5 mm (ϵ280 = 5120 m-1 cm-1), 75 mm SDS, 6% D2O, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, and 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 270 μl. Besides isotropic samples, alignment of the protein-micelle complex relative to the magnetic field was achieved in the presence of stretched, negatively charged polyacrylamide gels (40Tycko R. Blanco F.J. Ishii Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9340-9341Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 41Ulmer T.S. Ramirez B.E. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9179-9191Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Gels were polymerized from a 4.6% w/v solution of acrylamide, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate (AMPS), and bisacrylamide with a monomer to cross-linker ratio of 39:1 (w/w) and a molar ratio of 96:4 of acrylamide to AMPS, employing the previously described conventions and conditions (20Ulmer T.S. Bax A. Cole N.B. Nussbaum R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9595-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar).NMR Spectroscopy—All experiments were carried out at 25 °C on Bruker spectrometers operating at 1H frequencies of 600 and 800 MHz, equipped with cryogenic probes. Data were processed and analyzed with the NMRPipe package (42Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11376) Google Scholar) and the program Xeasy (43Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Throughout most experiments, the TROSY N–H component was selected (44Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar, 45Weigelt J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10778-10779Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and the solvent signal was returned to +Iz before acquisition (46Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem.

HN, N, Cα, and C′ assignments were made from HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, and HSQC-NOESY-TROSY experiments.HN–HN NOEs were measured from HSQC-NOESY-TROSY experiments (τmix = 170 ms). 1JNH, 1JCαC′, 1JC′N, and 1JNH+1DNH, 1JCαC′+1DCαC′, 1JC′N+1DC′N couplings were determined from mixed-constant time, HN-coupled HNCO (48Cornilescu G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 10143-10154Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar), quantitative J-correlation HN(CA)CO (49Jaroniec C.P. Ulmer T.S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 30: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and quantitative J-correlation HNCO experiments (50Chou J.J. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) of isotropic and aligned samples, respectively. The 15N relaxation parameters R1, R2, and {1H}–15N NOE were determined at 60.8 MHz (51Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar, 52Zhu G. Xia Y.L. Nicholson L.K. Sze K.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 143: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For the {1H}–15N NOE measurement, 5 s of presaturation preceded by a recycling delay of 4 s were used for the NOE experiment and a 9-s recycle delay for the reference experiment.Structure Calculation—In complete analogy to the aS wild-type structure calculation (20Ulmer T.S. Bax A. Cole N.B. Nussbaum R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9595-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), backbone dihedral angle restraints were derived by molecular fragment replacement (MFR) (53Delaglio F. Kontaxis G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2142-2143Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 54Kontaxis G. Delaglio F. Bax A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 394: 42-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Considering that large amplitude internal dynamics complicates such an analysis, MFR results are restricted to residues exhibiting generalized order parameters, S2, above 0.6. The remaining residues are represented by random-coil conformations. A fragment length of seven residues was used during MFR (20Ulmer T.S. Bax A. Cole N.B. Nussbaum R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9595-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). For the aS(A30P) variant, 278 N, Cα, and C′ chemical shifts and 261 1DNH, 1DCαC′, and 1DC′N RDCs were used; for the aS(A53T) variant these numbers were also 278 and 261, respectively. HN–HN internuclear distances were quantified from HN–HN NOE values using an empirical 1/r-4 dependence (55Guntert P. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) for the ratio of diagonal- to cross-peak intensities, calibrated to a HNi-1–HNi distance of 2.8 Å within α-helical conformation. Although MFR yields well defined local geometry for structured regions that are mobile with respect to the main part of the protein, such mobility typically results in a reduction in magnitude of the local alignment tensor, Da. Backbone torsion angles can therefore be obtained for the ordered part of the protein (S2 > 0.6), but the relative orientation of structural elements with much reduced Da values cannot be defined accurately by RDCs. Consequently, during structure calculations a global alignment tensor and RDCs were only used for residues within fragments exhibiting Da > 6 Hz and S2 > 0.8 (residues 9–21, 57–63, and 70–80 for A30P; residues 11–22, 50–62, and 71–79 for A53T). Based on essentially indistinguishable relative orientations of the N- and C-terminal helices from those previously observed in wild-type aS, the same interhelix distance restraints previously measured for wild-type aS on the basis of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (20Ulmer T.S. Bax A. Cole N.B. Nussbaum R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9595-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) were used in the structure calculations of A30P and A53T. Simulated annealing calculations were carried out using the program Xplor-NIH 2.9.5 (56Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar), using a temperature gradient from 500 to 0 K, in the presence of empirical potentials of mean force for backbone-backbone hydrogen-bonding (57Grishaev A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 7281-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and torsion angles (58Kuszewski J.J. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 146: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The energy-minimized average structures of aS(A30P) and aS(A53T), respectively, were calculated from the ensemble of twenty lowest energy structures.SDS-protein Cross-relaxation Effects—The availability of deuterated wild-type aS and PD variants was used as an opportunity to detect cross-relaxation between protein backbone 1HN nuclei and the SDS protons in a straightforward manner. The ratio of H–N cross-peak intensities from TROSY spectra recorded with and without selective presaturation of a particular SDS resonance, I/I0, was quantified. Experiments were recorded in an interleaved manner, and 15N Boltzmann magnetization was eliminated by phase cycling. SDS exhibits four well resolved 1H signals, corresponding to (CH2)1,(CH2)2, (CH2)3–11, and (CH2)12 (cf. the Spectral Data base for Organic Compounds, SDBS 2985HSP-46-269), which can be selectively irradiated. The employed presaturation (500 ms, γHB1 = 22 Hz) of, for example, (CH2)3–11 attenuated the signal intensities of neighboring resonances (CH2)1, (CH2)2, and (CH2)12 by 25%, 15, and 40%, respectively. To assess any contribution from residual carbon-bonded protein protons, I/I0 was also measured using deuterated SDS with presaturation of (CH2)3–11. An essentially random fluctuation with I/I0 = 0.995 ± 0.009 was obtained (supplemental Fig. S1), confirming the validity of the current approach.SDS Titration—Titrations as a function of SDS concentration were performed in 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4/6% D2O at 25°C and 800 MHz. At each titration point a TROSY-HSQC spectrum was recorded with t1,max(15N) = 145 ms, t2,max(1HN) = 114 ms, using final digital resolutions of 1.7 and 2.2 Hz/point, respectively. For both aS(A30P) and aS(A53T), starting protein concentrations were 0.2 mm. A total of 11 titration steps were performed for each sample, from molar aS:SDS ratios of 1:0 to 1:422. The first titration step was chosen at 2.8 mm SDS (aS:SDS = 1:14), just above its estimated critical micelle concentration of 2.6 mm (59Brito R.M.M Vaz W.L.C Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Between the titration steps corresponding to aS:SDS ratios of 1:14 and 1:43, complex spectral properties are obtained for resonances of the repeat region (20Ulmer T.S. Bax A. Cole N.B. Nussbaum R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9595-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Between aS:SDS ratios of 1:58 and 1:422, peak positions change relatively little and assignments follow directly from those made at aS:SDS = 1:150.RESULTSStructure and Dynamics of aS(A53T) Are Essentially Indistinguishable from Wild-type aS—Chemical shifts of nuclei are sensitive probes of local structure and, in particular, differences in chemical shifts are highly sensitive indicators for differences in structure. Because each nucleus provides a unique reporter site, differences in structure between two proteins can be compared at numerous sites. Here, the chemical shift, δ, of the backbone amide proton (1HN) and the secondary shift of the 13Cα nucleus for each amino acid residue are compared between the aS(A53T) variant and wild-type aS. The 1HN chemical shift depends on the immediate chemical environment, including both local geometry and hydrogen bonding (60Oldfield E. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2002; 53: 349-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 61Wishart D.S. Case D.A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 338: 3-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 62Cordier F. Grzesiek S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1601-1602Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). 13Cα shifts depend most strongly on the backbone torsion angles ϕ and Ψ (63Spera S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5490-5492Crossref Scopus (992) Google Scholar), and the difference between the experimental 13Cα shift and tabulated random-coil values yields readily interpretable structural information.Detectable 1HN shift differences between aS(A53T) and aS extend over approximately ±8 amino acid residues from the site of mutation (Fig. 2A). In agreement with the local α-helical secondary structure, the most pronounced 1HN shift changes are observed for the 1HN nuclei closest to the new side chain of residue 53, in particular those in positions -3, +3, and +4 from the site of mutation (Fig. 2A). Except for residues 53 and 54, 13Cα secondary shifts in aS(A53T) and aS are essentially the same (Fig. 2B). Small increases in 13Cα secondary shift for Thr53 and Thr54 in the mutant suggest the adoption of slightly higher local helical character compared with wild-type aS. However, when calculating the structure of the aS(A53T) variant, it was found to be indistinguishable from wild-type aS, as expected on the basis of the very similar chemical shifts for the remaining residues, and therefore warrants no further discussion.FIGURE 2Comparison of structural and dynamic parameters between the aS(A53T) variant and wild-type aS. A, differences in amide proton (1HN) chemical shift between aS(A53T) and wild-type aS. B, difference in observed 13Cα chemical shift and tabulated random-coil values as a function of residue number, for both aS(A53T) (red) and wild-type aS (black). These so-called 13Cα secondary shifts are reported relative to the random coil values of Ref. 63Spera S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5490-5492Crossref Scopus (992) Google Scholar but have not been corrected for the ∼+0.5 ppm isotope shift resulting from perdeuteration of the carbon-attached hydrogens. C, generalized order parameters, S2, derived from backbone 15N relaxation analysis using an isotropic model (79Dosset P. Hus J.C. Blackledge M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In the presence of the unfolded tail of aS, an isotropic model was found to reproduce the relaxation data well (data not shown). If only residues in the structured region are considered for which relaxation parameters could be extracted for all three examined aS forms (54 residues), rotational correlation times, τc, of 15.8 ± 0.1 ns and 16.0 ± 0.1 ns are obtained for aS(A53T) and wild-type aS, respectively. Statistical errors in S2 are smaller than the data symbols. D, variation of the absolute alignment tensor magnitude, Da, obtained during molecular fragment replacement (MFR) using a fragment length of seven residues, along the sequence. The fragment number corresponds to the center residue of each 7-residue fragment. No unique local structure could be found for fragments involving the highly mobile tail residues, and therefore no Da values are available for this region. To compensate for a slight variation in the alignment strength of the employed aligning media, the Da values of aS(A53T) have been uniformly scaled to obtain a match with wild-type aS for t"

The exception is BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator), which instead interacts with the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member HVEM (herpes virus entry mediator). To better understand this interaction, we determined the 2.8-Å crystal structure of the BTLA-HVEM complex. This structure shows that BTLA binds the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain of HVEM and employs a unique binding surface compared with other CD28-like receptors. Moreover, the structure shows that BTLA recognizes the same surface on HVEM as gD (herpes virus glycoprotein D) and utilizes a similar binding motif. Light scattering analysis demonstrates that the extracellular domain of BTLA is monomeric and that BTLA and HVEM form a 1:1 complex. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of HVEM was used to further define critical binding residues. Finally, BTLA adopts an immunoglobulin I-set fold.

Despite structural similarities to other CD28-like members, BTLA represents a unique co-receptor. Co-receptor signaling is an important mechanism of coordinating and tightly regulating immune response. For instance, activation of naïve T cells requires a second co-stimulatory signal in addition to stimulation of the T cell receptor by engagement with peptide-MHC complexes. Conversely, co-inhibitory signals are required to maintain T cell self-tolerance and prevent autoimmunity (1Sharpe A.H. Freeman G.J. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 116-126Crossref Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). The CD28-like family is one important class of co-receptors. These members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) 2The abbreviations used are:IgSFimmunoglobulin superfamilyBTLAB and T lymphocyte attenuatorCRDcysteine-rich domainCTLA4cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4ECDextracellular domaingDherpesvirus glycoprotein DHVEMherpesvirus entry mediatorLIGHThomologous to lymphotoxin, showing inducible expression, and competing with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D for herpesvirus entry mediator, a receptor expressed by T lymphocytesTNFSFtumor necrosis factor superfamilyTNFRSFtumor necrosis factor receptor superfamilyLTαlymphotoxin αNi-NTAnickel-nitriloacetic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography function as either co-stimulators (CD28 and inducible T cell costimulator) or co-inhibitors (CTLA-4, programmed death-1, and BTLA) in modulating immune cell activity (2Greenwald R.J. Freeman G.J. Sharpe A.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 515-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). In general, these co-receptors are activated by members of the Ig containing B7 family (1Sharpe A.H. Freeman G.J. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 116-126Crossref Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). In addition to the CD28- and B7-like families of receptors and ligands, members of the TNF superfamilies of ligands and receptors (the TNFSF and TNFRSF respectively), such as OX40L-OX40, LIGHT-HVEM, CD27L-CD27, CD30L-CD30, and 4_1BBL-4_1BB, have also been reported to function as co-stimulators (3Watts T.H.

Loyet K.M. Calemine-Fenaux J. Chauhan V. Wranik B. Ouyang W. Eaton D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Sedy J.R. Gavrieli M.

This is the first example of cross-talk between the CD28 family and the TNFRSF. Whereas HVEM has been previously described as a co-stimulator triggered by the TNF-like ligands lymphotoxin α (LTα) and LIGHT (6Granger S.W. Rickert S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), recent results from HVEM knock-out mice as well as the interaction between BTLA and HVEM are consistent with HVEM playing a co-inhibitory role (7Wang Y. Subudhi S.K. Anders R.A. Lo J. Sun Y. Blink S. Wang J. Liu X. Mink K. Degrandi D. Pfeffer K. Fu Y.X. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition to binding BTLA, LIGHT, and LTα, human HVEM is also a host cell receptor for herpes simplex virus 1 by binding to herpes simplex virus 1 glycoprotein D (gD) (8Montgomery R.I. Warner M.S. Lum B.J. Spear P.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Structurally, the connection between the IgSF family represented by BTLA and the TNFRSF proteins such as HVEM is unexpected. Crystal structures of CD28, CTLA-4, and programmed death-1 have revealed that these co-stimulatory and co-inhibitor receptors are all members of the immunoglobulin superfamily with each protein containing an extracellular IgV domain (9Evans E.J. Esnouf R.M. Manso-Sancho R. Gilbert R.J. James J.R. Yu C. Fennelly J.A. Vowles C. Hanke T. Walse B. Hunig T. Sorensen P. Stuart D.I. Davis S.J. Nat.

Based on sequence analysis, BTLA was also expected to contain an extracellular IgV domain. Similarly, the extracellular domains of B7-like proteins are comprised of Ig domains. Co-crystal structures of B7-1 and B7-2 bound to CTLA4 show that Ig domains from the receptor and ligand pack against each other forming a compact interface (12Schwartz J.C. Zhang X. Fedorov A.A. Nathenson S.G. Almo S.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 13Stamper C.C. Zhang Y. Tobin J.F. Erbe D.V. Ikemizu S. Davis S.J. Stahl M.L. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In contrast, the TNFSF and TNFRSF members are formed by very different structural elements and interact in a distinctive manner determined by the quaternary structure of TNF-like ligands. These proteins are homotrimeric or occasionally heterotrimeric proteins comprised of jelly-roll monomers. Multidomain TNFRSF family members are comprised of multiple pseudo-repeats of a cysteinerich motif. Structures of signaling complexes formed by TNF-like ligands and receptors show that the elongated receptors bind at monomer-monomer interfaces on the ligands in a manner much different from the compact B7-CD28-type interaction (14Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The BTLA-HVEM interaction is also unusual in that it represents the first example of a TNFRSF functioning as a “ligand” and is one of a handful of examples of a TNFRSF interacting with a non-TNF-like ligand. In addition to the BTLA-HVEM and gD-HVEM interactions, other TNFSFR, which bind unusual ligands, include the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75, which binds the cystine knot growth factor NGF, and feline OX40, which acts as a co-receptor for the feline immunodeficiency virus (15Wiesmann C. de Vos A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Shimojima M. Miyazawa T. Ikeda Y. McMonagle E.L. Haining H. Akashi H. Takeuchi Y. Hosie M.J. Willett B.J. Science. 2004; 303: 1192-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the relevant complexes show that gD protein interacts primarily with the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD1) of HVEM on the surface opposite the TNFSF binding site (17Carfi A. Willis S.H. Whitbeck J.C. Krummenacher C. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Similarly, p75 uses the same respective surface on CRD1 and a part of CRD2 to bind NGF (18He X.L. Garcia K.C. Science. 2004; 304: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Previous biochemical characterization suggests that BTLA also binds to HVEM on the CRD1 distal to the TNFSF binding site (4Gonzalez L.C. Loyet K.M. Calemine-Fenaux J. Chauhan V. Wranik B. Ouyang W. Eaton D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Sedy J.R. Gavrieli M. Potter K.G. Hurchla M.A. Lindsley R.C. Hildner K. Scheu S. Pfeffer K. Ware C.F. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To obtain a more detailed understanding of the novel interaction between the CD28-like protein BTLA and the TNFRSF member HVEM, we have determined the 2.8-Å crystal structure of the BTLA-HVEM complex. This structure shows that despite major structural differences between BTLA and gD, they bind to an overlapping site on HVEM using a similar β-sheet binding motif. We have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis and Scatchard assays to identify critical BTLA-binding residues on HVEM. Mutations that significantly reduced binding affinities were in close agreement with the crystal structure. Light scattering demonstrates that the recombinant extracellular domain of BTLA is monomeric and that BTLA and HVEM form a 1:1 complex in solution. Despite the homology and functional similarities between BTLA and the CD28 family, BTLA contains structurally unique features. Moreover, compared with the CD28-B7 binding site, BTLA uses a distinct surface to interact with HVEM. Finally, using the BTLA-HVEM structure, we propose a hypothetical model for a BTLA-HVEM-TNF ternary complex. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—DNA encoding human BTLA residues 26-137 (the initial methionine is residue 1) with the addition of a C-terminal His8 tag was expressed in Escherichia coli. Inclusion bodies from BTLA expressing E. coli were extracted under denaturing conditions, and the protein was purified on a Ni-NTA metal chelate column as described (19Kirchhofer D. Peek M. Li W. Stamos J. Eigenbrot C. Kadkhodayan S. Elliott J.M. Corpuz R.T. Lazarus R.A. Moran P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36341-36349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fractions were pooled and diluted to 50 μg/ml with buffer containing 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.6), 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm glutathione (oxidized), and 1 mm glutathione (reduced). The refolding mixture was incubated overnight at 2-8 °C, and the pH adjusted to pH 3.0 with trifluoroacetic acid. The acidified refolding mixture was loaded onto an RP-HPLC Vydac C4 column (1.0 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water and eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (from 15 to 55%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 3 ml/min for a total of 35 min. Protein fractions were pooled, and the acetonitrile was removed by evaporation assisted by a gentle stream of N2. The RP-HPLC pool was buffer exchanged using a HiTrap Desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 0.15 m NaCl. BTLA activity was evaluated using SPR (Biacore). BTLA-Fc fusion protein was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells as previously described (4Gonzalez L.C. Loyet K.M. Calemine-Fenaux J. Chauhan V. Wranik B. Ouyang W. Eaton D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The BTLA-Fc construct contains a Genenase site (New England Biolabs) between the BTLA extracellular domain (ECD) and the Fc fusion. BTLA ECD was cleaved from the Fc domain by the addition of a 1:100 ratio of Genenase to BTLA-Fc in phosphate-buffered saline. After 2 h at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with a protease inhibitor mixture and loaded onto a protein A-Sepharose column. Cleaved BTLA was collected from the flow through. DNA encoding a truncated human HVEM ECD, residues 1-105 (residue numbered as in Protein Data Bank code 1JMA; residue 1 is the first residue in the mature protein), corresponding to the ordered portion of HVEM in the gD-HVEM complex, including CRD1, CRD2, and the N-terminal 22 residues of CRD3, was subcloned into the pET15b vector and subsequently cloned into the baculovirus secretion vector pAcGP67-B. Virus was made by co-transfection and three rounds of viral amplification in Sf9 cells. High titer virus was used to infect Hi5 insect cells, and protein was expressed for 3 days and the media treated as described (20Hymowitz S.G. Filvaroff E.H. Yin J.P. Lee J. Cai L. Risser P. Maruoka M. Mao W. Foster J. Kelley R.F. Pan G. Gurney A.L. de Vos A.M. Starovasnik M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5332-5341Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) prior to being loaded onto a Ni-NTA-agarose column and eluted with 250 mm imidazole buffer. Thrombin was added (1 unit/mg of HVEM) to remove the N-terminal His tag, and the solution was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The dialysate was concentrated and loaded onto an S-75 sizing column equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8). Fractions of purified HVEM were pooled and yielded ∼0.5 mg of protein/liter of Hi5 cells. As a control, a construct of full-length human HVEM ECD (hereafter referred to as HVEML) with a C-terminal His tag was also expressed and purified. This construct contains the same HVEM residues as that used by Carfi et al. (17Carfi A. Willis S.H. Whitbeck J.C. Krummenacher C. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and Whitbeck et al. (21Whitbeck J.C. Peng C. Lou H. Xu R. Willis S.H. Ponce de Leon M. Peng T. Nicola A.V. Montgomery R.I. Warner M.S. Soulika A.M. Spruce L.A. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. Spear P.G. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6083-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For crystallography, the BTLA-HVEM complex was made by adding excess HVEM residues 1-105 to E. coli-expressed BTLA and incubating at room temperature for 1 h. The complex was concentrated and purified from excess HVEM (residues 1-105) with an S-75 sizing column equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0). Fractions containing purified complex were pooled and concentrated to 9 mg/ml. DNA encoding LIGHT extracellular domain residues 91-240 was expressed and purified in the same manner as HVEM with a final purification on Superdex S-200 sizing equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0). Expression yielded greater than 1 mg of purified protein/liter of Hi5 cells. Crystallographic Data Collection and Structure Determination—Crystals of the BTLA-HVEM complex were grown by vapor diffusion at 19 °C using the sitting drop method. Crystals formed in drops containing protein solution were mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 2.0 m sodium formate, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6). The resulting small, clustered crystals were used to seed new drops yielding larger, single crystals. The crystals were transferred briefly to a droplet containing reservoir solution with 30% glycerol before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. The crystals belonged to space group C2221, and the asymmetric unit contained two copies of the BTLA-HVEM complex. A data set to 2.8-Å resolution was measured from a single crystal at beam line 5.0.1 of the Berkeley Center for Structural Biology at the Advanced Light Source. The data were processed using the HKL package (22Otwinowsk Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Structures of HVEM (chain B in PDB code 1JMA) and murine BTLA (PDB 1XAU; structure determined and deposited by D. Fremont and co-workers in 2004) were used as search models to determine the structure of the BTLA-HVEM complex by molecular replacement. Side chains, which differed between murine and human BTLA, were manually trimmed to C-β. The program Phaser (23Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) gave a clear solution. A 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry-averaged and solvent-flattened map using program dm (24Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) revealed clear density for the missing hBTLA side chains. The model was refined with REFMAC5 (25Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) with tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints on residues 34-144 of BTLA and residues 4-83 of HVEM. The last 10 residues of BTLA were not included in the noncrystallographic symmetry restrains as they differed significantly because of the involvement of the C-terminal His tag in crystal packing contacts. Additional density was observed for a metal ion interacting with the His tag of symmetry related copies of chain A. This ion was modeled as a Ni(II) and is likely an artifact because of purification of BTLA by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Refinement and model statistics are shown in TABLE ONE. The coordinates for the BTLA-HVEM complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank and assigned access code 2AW2.TABLE ONECrystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsBTLA-HVEMData collection Space groupC2221 Resolution (Å)50-2.80 (2.90-2.80)aNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.

Open table in a new tab Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis and Cell Binding Affinity Assays—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used as recommended by the manufacturer to generate single alanine mutations in HVEM. Mutant HVEM sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant BTLA-Fc was iodinated by the lactoperoxidase (Biotrend) method and LIGHT by the IODO-GEN (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) method. Displacement binding studies were done as previously described (4Gonzalez L.C. Loyet K.M. Calemine-Fenaux J. Chauhan V. Wranik B. Ouyang W. Eaton D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) with 0.5 nm labeled BTLA and varying concentrations of unlabeled protein. LIGHT binding was confirmed with 0.5 nm labeled LIGHT with or without 1000-fold excess of unlabeled protein. LIGHT binding to alanine mutants was normalized as a percentage of wild type binding. AD-293 cells were transiently transfected with either wild type or alanine mutant HVEM cDNA as previously described (4Gonzalez L.C. Loyet K.M. Calemine-Fenaux J. Chauhan V. Wranik B. Ouyang W. Eaton D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) using pRK mock-transfected cells as a negative control. Expression of wild type and alanine mutant HVEM was confirmed by flow cytometry as previously described using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-human HVEM (clone 122, MBL) in comparison to an isotype control (BD Biosciences). The HVEM antibody epitope is contained in all HVEM point mutants. Expression levels of point mutants are normalized to that of wild type HVEM as denoted by the percentage of cells above a given mean fluorescence threshold determined by isotype control antibody staining. Light Scattering—Molar Mass determination was carried out using a Agilent 1100 series (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) HPLC system in line with a Wyatt MiniDawn MALS (multiangle light scattering) detector (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). Concentration measurements were made using an online Wyatt OPTILAB DSP interferometric refractometer (Wyatt Technology). Astra software (Wyatt Technology) was used for light scattering data acquisition and processing. Either a Shodex 803 or a S75 10/300 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with filtered phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) was used with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Both the light scattering unit and the refractometer were calibrated as per the manufacturer's instructions. A value of 0.180 ml/g was assumed for the dn/dc ratio of the protein. Measuring the signal from monomeric bovine serum albumin normalized the detector responses. The temperature of the light scattering unit was maintained at 25 °C, and the temperature of the refractometer was kept at 35 °C. The column and all external connections were at ambient temperature (20-25 °C). Recombinant BTLA produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the purified HVEM-BTLA complex used for crystallization, and HVEML was loaded at 1.0 mg/ml. The structure of the human BTLA-HVEM complex was solved by molecular replacement using the structures of the HVEM ECD (PDB code 1JMA, chain B) and the 1.8-Å structure of murine BTLA ECD (PDB code 1XAU) as search models with the program Phaser (23Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). A solution was found with two copies of the BTLA-HVEM complex forming the asymmetric unit. The structure was manually rebuilt and refined to an R/Rfree of 23.1 and 27.8%, respectively (TABLE ONE, Fig. 1). The final model consists of BTLA residues 34-137 and HVEM residues 5-92 and 95-102. In both copies of BTLA, an additional 4-6 residues from the C-terminal His tag were well ordered in the electron density and are included in the model. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were used throughout the refinement and the two copies of the BTLA-HVEM complex are very similar. This structure reveals that human BTLA, like murine BTLA (PDB code 1XAU), is a compact IgG domain composed of two flat β-sheets, which are formed by strands B, E, and D in one sheet and strands A′,G, F, C, and C′ in the other (Fig. 1B). The sheets are buttressed by three disulfides (residues 72-79, 34-63, and 58-115). The Cys72-Cys79 disulfide connects the C and C′ strands; the Cys34-Cys63 disulfide joins the N-terminal region preceding strand A′ to the CD loop, and the Cys58-Cys115 disulfide connects the B and F strands. This disulfide is completely buried in the hydrophobic core of BTLA and is part of the “Y-corner” motif, DX(G/A)DXYXC. The B-F strand disulfide and the Y-corner motif are both highly conserved features in IgSF domains. In addition to the Cys58-Cys115 disulfide, the Cys34-Cys63 disulfide is also conserved in murine BTLA. The Cys72-Cys79 disulfide is not conserved in all murine BTLA alleles (see below). This disulfide is not present in the variant of murine BTLA, which was crystallized (PDB code 1XAU) in which the cysteine corresponding to Cys79 is replaced by a tryptophan. The sequence of human BTLA contains three putative N-linked glycosylation sites. Expression of recombinant BTLA in eukaryotic cells results in a protein with significant glycosylation that is unsuitable for crystallization. For the structural studies, recombinant BTLA was expressed in E. coli cells to produce a protein without glycosylation. Examination of the BTLA-HVEM complex (below) shows that the putative N-linked glycosylation sites are away from the binding site and would not be expected to affect the interaction between BTLA and HVEM (Fig. 1). Analysis of the interaction between BTLA expressed in E. coli and HVEM by surface plasmon resonance shows that glycosylation is not required for HVEM binding. 3L. Gonzalez, unpublished data. The BTLA-HVEM Complex—The BTLA-HVEM complex consists of a single globular BTLA interacting with the membrane distal region of rod-shaped HVEM (Fig. 1). BTLA binds HVEM using two short segments: an N-terminal extension preceding strand A′ (residues 35-43) and the short G° strand (residues 118-128). The HVEM binding site for BTLA consists almost exclusively of residues from CRD1. BTLA residues 35-43 interact with HVEM residues 26-33, which form the “tip” of HVEM CRD1 distal to the C terminus. This loop in HVEM leads to a strand (residues 33-38) that, together with the G° strand from BTLA, makes the heart of the binding interface. These two strands form a small anti-parallel intermolecular β-sheet. This interaction is primarily mediated by main chain hydrogen bonds and includes relatively few side chain contacts. These two interactions, in conjunction with small contribution from the BTLA CC′ loop, generate an interface that buries ∼1800 Å2 of solvent accessible surface area, which is contributed equally by both binding partners. This complex positions the C termini of the two proteins in opposite directions consistent with the BTLA-HVEM complex forming between proteins resident on different cells. Moreover, as full-length HVEM includes an additional ∼60 residues prior to the transmembrane helix, it is also possible that the binary BTLA-HVEM interaction could occur between proteins residing on the same cell. Sequence Polymorphism in Murine BTLA—Three different BTLA alleles have been isolated from 23 mice strains. These alleles have been labeled BALB/c-like, MRL/lpr-like, and C57BL/6-like according to the strains from which they were derived (26Hurchla M.A. Sedy J.R. Gavrieli M. Drake C.G. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of murine BTLA is of the BALB/c-like variant. The BALB/c and MLR/lpr alleles differ at only one amino acid, whereas the C57BL/6-like allele differs from the other two by 10 or 11 amino acids, respectively, in the extracellular Ig domain (26Hurchla M.A. Sedy J.R. Gavrieli M. Drake C.G. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The structural and functional consequences of these differences can be predicted based on the structure of the human BTLA-HVEM complex. The most interesting difference is the polymorphism between Trp and Cys at position 85 corresponding to the human residue Cys79 (hereafter human BTLA residue numbers will follow in parentheses). In the C57BL/6 allele, the presence of a Cys at this position suggests that a disulfide analogous to the Cys72-Cys79 disulfide in hBTLA will be formed. The disulfide containing variant may be more stable as solvent-exposed unpaired cysteine residues can lead to inappropriate oxidation, oligomerization, or misfolding. Another interesting difference between the alleles is that in the C57BL/6 variant, glutamines replace a glutamate and an arginine at positions 72 (h66) and 102 (h93), respectively, resulting in exchange of a solvent-exposed salt bridge with a potential hydrogen bonding interaction.

We previously found a significant increase in the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI 3-kinase) and striking decrease in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity in the skeletal muscle of transgenic animals overexpressing human placental growth hormone. Herein, using transgenic mice bearing deletions in p85α, p85β, or insulin-like growth factor-1, we provide novel evidence suggesting that overexpression of p85α is a primary mechanism for skeletal muscle insulin resistance in response to GH. We found that the excess in total p85 was entirely accounted for by an increase in the free p85α-specific isoform. In mice with a liver-specific deletion in insulin-like growth factor-1, excess GH caused insulin resistance and an increase in skeletal muscle p85α, which was completely reversible using a GH-releasing hormone antagonist. To understand the role of p85α in GH-induced insulin resistance, we used mice bearing deletions of the genes coding for p85α or p85β, respectively (p85α +/– and p85β–/–). Wild type and p85β–/– mice developed in vivo insulin resistance and demonstrated overexpression of p85α and reduced insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity in skeletal muscle in response to GH. In contrast, p85α+/–mice retained global insulin sensitivity and PI 3-kinase activity associated with reduced p85α expression. These findings demonstrated the importance of increased p85α in mediating skeletal muscle insulin resistance in response to GH and suggested a potential role for reducing p85α as a therapeutic strategy for enhancing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle.

Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Normally, the regulatory subunit exists in stoichiometric excess to the catalytic one, resulting in a pool of free p85 monomers not associated with the p110 catalytic subunit. The p85 monomers bind to phosphorylated IRS proteins, blocking access to p85-p110 heterodimers. Thus, there exists a balance between the free p85 monomer and the p85-p110 heterodimer with the latter being responsible for the PI 3-kinase activity. Increases or decreases in expression of p85 shift this balance in favor of either free p85 or p85-p110 complexes (3Terauchi Y. Tsuji Y. Satoh S. Minoura H. Murakami K. Okuno A. Inukai K. Asano T.

Because the monomer and the heterodimer compete for the same binding sites on the IRS proteins, an imbalance could cause either increased or decreased PI 3-kinase activity.In the present study, we found that excess p85 regulatory subunits in TG-hPGH muscle was accounted for by a specific increase in the free p85α isoform. To elucidate whether the increase in p85α was mediated by GH or IGF-1, we selected an insulin-resistant knock-out mouse with a liver-specific deletion of IGF-1 and with compensatory high GH levels (8Yakar S.

Increased skeletal muscle p85α in liver-specific IGF-1 gene deletion (LID) mice was observed and was reversible along with insulin resistance with the administration of a growth hormone-releasing hormone antagonist. Finally, to confirm the role of p85α in the genesis of GH-induced insulin resistance, we took advantage of insulin-sensitive mice with either heterozygous deletions of p85α or a complete knockout of p85β (5Mauvais-Jarvis F.

Animals with heterozygous disruption of p85α gene (p85α+/– mice) were unable to increase p85α expression and remained insulin-sensitive, whereas their wild type (WT) and p85β–/– counterparts responded to 3 days of GH administration with increases in p85α expression, reduction in insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity and insensitivity to insulin. Together, these findings suggested that increased p85α is a potent negative regulator of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle and insulin resistance in vivo in response to growth hormone.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—TG mice that overexpress human placental growth hormone (TG-hPGH) driven by the metallothionine promoter have been described previously (1Barbour L.A.

The TG-hPGH mice are extremely insulin-resistant when examined by glucose and insulin challenge tests. Their IGF-1 levels are elevated, but free fatty acids are not increased.Mice heterozygous for the Pik3r1 allele (p85α+/–) and homozygous Pik3r2 knock-out mice (p85β–/–) have been characterized previously in the laboratories of Drs. Kahn and Cantley (5Mauvais-Jarvis F. Ueki K. Fruman D.A. Hirshman M.F. Sakamoto K. Goodyear L.J. Iannacone M. Accili D. Cantley L.C. Kahn C.R. J. Clin.

All mice were of mixed genetic background consisting of 129S and C57BL/6; therefore, C57BL/6 mice were used as WT controls.Skeletal muscle from mice with a LID was kindly provided by D. LeRoith, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD and have been described previously (8Yakar S. Liu J.-L. Fernandez A.M. Wu Y. Schally A.V. Frystyk J. Chernausek S.D. Mejia W. LeRoith D.

These mice show a marked reduction in circulating IGF-1, elevated GH levels, and severe insulin resistance, primarily at the level of skeletal muscle. Treatment with a GH-releasing hormone antagonist, MZ4-71 (GA), for 28 days effectively normalized GH levels and also restored insulin sensitivity (9Yakar S. Setser J. Zhao H. Stannard B. Haluzik M. Glatt V. Bouxsein M.L. Kopchick J.J. LeRoith D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).Four to six mice in each group were used in each comparison. All mice were studied at ∼14–18 weeks and were fed a normal mouse diet ad libitum. The guidelines for the care and treatment of the animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.Materials—Regular insulin was purchased from Novo Nordisc, Princeton, NJ. Bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors aprotinin and leupeptin were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Antibodies to IRS-1 and total (pan) p85, and specific to the α component of p85 (p85α), were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. Antibodies to p110 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, protein A-Sepharose, and chemiluminescence reagents (ECL kit) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. AG Resins, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, PAGE gel equipment, and protein assay kits were from Bio-Rad. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant rat growth hormone (rrGH) was purchased from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (Los Angeles, CA).Insulin Tolerance Tests—Insulin tolerance tests were performed in p85α+/–, p85β–/–, and WT mice before and after GH injections (1 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily for 3 days). Mice were fasted for 6 h and injected intraperitoneally with insulin (0.75 units/kg of body weight). Blood (5 μl) was collected from the tail vein at 0 and 60 min after insulin injection. Glucose measurements were performed with an Acucheck Advantage glucose meter.Acute Insulin Stimulation in Vivo and Tissue Collection—Mice were fasted for 6 h and anesthetized with ketamine (150 mg/kg) and acepromazine (5 mg/kg), and abdominal cavities were opened, and the inferior vena cava was exposed. Approximately 300 mg of gastrocnemius muscle from one hind limb was rapidly removed and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. An insulin bolus of 10 units/kg of body weight was then injected into the inferior vena cava vein as described previously (1Barbour L.A. Shao J. Qiao L. Leitner W. Anderson M. Friedman J.E. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). At 5 min after injection, the gastrocnemius muscle from the opposite limb was excised and frozen immediately. The samples were stored at –80 °C until analysis.Western Blotting of Total p85, p85α, and p110—Muscle tissue was homogenized, and protein was assayed as described previously (1Barbour L.A. Shao J. Qiao L. Leitner W. Anderson M. Friedman J.E. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad,) in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times with TBS-T and probed with a polyclonal total p85 antibody (1:500 dilution), monoclonal p85α antibody (1:500 dilution), or polyclonal p110 antibody (1:250 dilution). Transfer and washing conditions were performed as described previously (1Barbour L.A. Shao J. Qiao L. Leitner W. Anderson M. Friedman J.E. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and exposed to Kodak BIOMAX films (Eastman Kodak Co.). The specific bands were quantitated using a GEL-DOC density scanner and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).Association of p85α with p110—Immunoprecipitation of p110 was carried out as described previously using polyclonal anti-p110 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1Barbour L.A. Shao J. Qiao L. Leitner W. Anderson M. Friedman J.E. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with either anti-p85α or anti-p110 antibodies was performed in the immunoprecipitates and supernatants.IRS-1-associated PI 3-Kinase Activity—The level of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity was determined in muscle extracts after immunoprecipitation with IRS-1 antibody overnight at 4 °C (400 μg of muscle protein/4 μg of antibody) followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose overnight, as described previously (1Barbour L.A. Shao J. Qiao L. Leitner W. Anderson M. Friedman J.E. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The lipids were resolved by thin layer chromatography in CHCl3:MEOH:H20:NH4OH (60:47:11·3: 2), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. The images were quantified using a Kodak Dynamic phosphorimaging device.Cell Culture Experiments—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown to 60% confluence in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 0.5 mm glutamine). After 24 h incubation with 1% fetal calf serum, cells were exposed to rrGH, either 500 or 2500 ng/ml for an additional 24 h. Cells were lysed, and expression of p85α was determined by Western blotting as described above.Statistics—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. and compared using either paired or unpaired t test as indicated. p values of < 0.05 are considered statistically significant.RESULTSIn our initial experiments, we previously reported increases in the amounts of total p85 expressed in skeletal muscle of transgenic mice overexpressing hPGH (1Barbour L.A. Shao J. Qiao L. Leitner W. Anderson M. Friedman J.E. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Further analyses revealed that the increases in p85 levels were predominantly accounted for by significant increases in p85α-specific isoform (p < 0.005; Fig. 1), whereas the levels of p110 were unchanged (data not shown). We confirmed this 2–3-fold increase in the p85α isoform by immunoprecipitating and immunoblotting with a p85α-specific antibody (data not shown).The catalytic p110 subunit was depleted by triple immunoprecipitation from the muscle lysate (4Ueki K.

The amount of p85α recovered in the immunoprecipitate reflects p85α bound to p110, whereas the amount of p85α in the supernatant denotes free p85α subunit, existing in excess of p110.The levels of p85α in the p110 immunoprecipitate were similar between the two groups of mice. However, the amount of free p85α (recovered in the supernatant) was significantly increased (p < 0.02; in the TG-hPGH mice (Fig. 2), confirming a substantially greater expression of p85α in the insulin-resistant TG-hPGH animals.FIGURE 2Excess free p85α in supernatant unbound to p110 in WT and TG-hPGH mice. The p110 catalytic unit was depleted by triple immunoprecipitation from the muscle lysate, and the levels of p85α were analyzed by Western blot of the immunoprecipitate (IP) and the supernatant (Sn). The amount of p85α recovered in the immunoprecipitate reflects p85α bound to p110, whereas the amount of p85α in the supernatant denotes free p85α subunit, existing in excess of p110.

Furthermore, treatment of these animals with a GA for 28 days reduced their levels of GH and completely reversed their insulin resistance (9Yakar S. Setser J. Zhao H. Stannard B. Haluzik M. Glatt V. Bouxsein M.L. Kopchick J.J. LeRoith D. J. Clin.

Moreover, treatment of LID mice with GA resulted in normalization of the p85α expression (Fig. 3) concomitant with a reversal of insulin resistance (9Yakar S. Setser J. Zhao H. Stannard B. Haluzik M.

Equivalent amounts of protein isolated from the muscle of WT, LID, and LID+GA mice were subjected to SDS-PAGE gel and blotted with PI 3-kinase p85α antibody. Control animals treated with GA were also studied. A representative blot is shown in the upper panel.

These mice were studied before and after twice daily injections of GH for 3 days. Both p85α+/– and p85β–/– mice are more sensitive to insulin than the WT mice, as described previously (2Ueki K.

Here we demonstrated that GH failed to induce insulin resistance in the p85α+/– mice while inducing insulin resistance in the WT and p85β–/– animals. Blood glucose levels were measured following an insulin challenge test before and after GH administration to document the development of insulin resistance, shown in Fig. 4. Although the WT and the p85β–/– mice became resistant to insulin after 3 days of GH injections, as noted by blunted blood glucose responses to insulin at 60 min (p < 0.005 versus pre-GH treatment), the p85α+/– mice remained highly sensitive to insulin.FIGURE 4Insulin tolerance tests in WT, p85α+/–, and p85β–/– before and after 3 days of administration of GH. Blood was collected from the tail vein at 0 and 60 min after insulin injection. The solid line indicates blood glucose values prior to GH injection; the dotted line indicates blood glucose values after GH injection.

Although GH administration significantly increased p85α in the WT and p85β–/– animals (p < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively), it had no effect on p85α in the p85α+/– mice. As expected, insulin increased IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity in all animals not exposed to GH (Fig. 6A, p < 0.01). Insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity was somewhat greater in the p85α+/– mice than in two other groups. Moreover, whereas administration of GH blunted insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity in the WT and p85β–/– animals, it failed to affect PI 3-kinase activity in the p85α+/– mice. In addition we measured the amount of p110 associated with IRS-1 in p85α+/– and p85β–/– mice versus controls treated with and without GH (Fig. 6B). As expected, we observed a reduced amount of p110 in the IRS-1 immunoprecipitates after GH treatment, confirming that p85α competes with the p85-p110 heterodimer for the IRS-1 binding sites in GH-treated animals. Notably, in p85α+/– mice, the GH effect is absent, mirroring the PI 3-kinase activity results, demonstrating that reducing the p85α levels restores insulin-stimulated p110 association with IRS-1.FIGURE 5Expression of p85α in WT, p85α+/–, and p85β–/– mice before and after GH treatment.

Since EphA2 is required for ephrin-A1 ligand-induced vascular remodeling and is overexpressed in a variety of vascularized human adenocarcinomas, we assessed tumor angiogenesis and metastatic progression in EphA2-deficient host animals. 4T1 metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma cells transplanted subcutaneously and orthotopically into EphA2-deficient female mice displayed decreased tumor volume, tumor cell survival, microvascular density, and lung metastasis relative to tumor-bearing littermate controls. To determine if the phenotype in EphA2-deficient mice was endothelial cell intrinsic, we also analyzed endothelial cells isolated from EphA2-deficient animals for their ability to incorporate into tumor vessels in vivo, as well as to migrate in response to tumor-derived signals in vitro. EphA2-deficient endothelial cells displayed impaired survival and failed to incorporate into tumor microvessels in vivo, and displayed impaired tumor-mediated migration in vitro relative to controls. These data suggest that host EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase function is required in the tumor microenvironment for tumor angiogenesis and metastatic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2148724380,"Interactions between transmembrane helices play a key role in almost all cellular processes involving membrane proteins. We have investigated helix-helix interactions in lipid bilayers with synthetic tryptophan-flanked peptides that mimic the membrane spanning parts of membrane proteins. The peptides were functionalized with pyrene to allow the self-association of the helices to be monitored by pyrene fluorescence and Trp-pyrene fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Specific labeling of peptides at either their N or C terminus has shown that helix-helix association occurs almost exclusively between antiparallel helices. Furthermore, computer modeling suggested that antiparallel association arises primarily from the electrostatic interactions between α-helix backbone atoms. We propose that such interactions may provide a force for the preferentially antiparallel association of helices in polytopic membrane proteins. Helix-helix association was also found to depend on the lipid environment. In bilayers of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, in which the hydrophobic length of the peptides approximately matched the bilayer thickness, association between the helices was found to require peptide/lipid ratios exceeding 1/25. Self-association of the helices was promoted by either increasing or decreasing the bilayer thickness, and by adding cholesterol.

For example, even when helices do not exhibit any tendency to undergo specific association (10Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 62-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 11Killian J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 12Mall S. Broadbridge R. Sharma R.P. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12379-12386Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), helix-helix association could still occur as a result of poor packing between the lipids and helices, or from a favorable change in entropy resulting from the release of helix-bound lipids upon helix association. In these cases, helix association is primarily driven by lipid-protein interactions rather than strongly favorable protein-protein interactions. It is likely that in real membrane proteins the driving forces for folding involve both types of interaction, whether or not specific protein-protein recognition motifs are present. One property of a protein-lipid system that is known to affect helix-helix association is the extent of matching between the hydrophobic length of the helices and the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer. In the case of hydrophobic mismatch, helix-helix interactions may be promoted because of relatively unfavorable lipid-helix interactions. It was previously shown with Lys-flanked TM peptides that hydrophobic mismatch does promote self-association, both when a helix-helix recognition motif is present (13Orzáez M. Lukovic D. Abad C. Pérez-Payá E. Mingarro I. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and in the absence of such a motif (14Webb R.J. East J.M. Sharma R.P. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Ren J.H. Lew S. Wang J.Y. London E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear whether or not helix-helix association can be considered a general response of TM helices to mismatch. This is because many other responses to hydrophobic mismatch can also occur (reviewed in Refs. 16Killian J.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar and 17de Planque M.R.R. Killian J.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), such as ordering/disordering of the lipid acyl chains, alterations in helix tilt angle, adaptations of the peptide backbone, and because it has been shown that the type and extent of the responses that occur depend on the composition of the TM helix. For example, Trp-flanked peptides, which were designed to mimic the membrane spanning parts of intrinsic membrane proteins, showed very different responses to hydrophobic mismatch than analogous Lys-flanked peptides (14Webb R.J. East J.M. Sharma R.P. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Ren J.H. Lew S. Wang J.Y. London E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The aims of the present study are to establish whether or not increased association is a general property of transmembrane segments under conditions of hydrophobic mismatch, and to understand the molecular details of any oligomers that are formed. We investigated the association between Trp-flanked peptides that were designed to mimic the transmembrane segments of real membrane proteins, without specific helix-helix recognition motifs. These model peptides allowed us to focus on nonspecific forces involved in membrane protein structure and stability. The peptides were functionalized with pyrene to allow monitoring of association by pyrene fluorescence and Trp-pyrene FRET. By labeling peptides at either their N or C terminus, we show that helix-helix association occurs almost exclusively between antiparallel helices. We also show that hydrophobic mismatch promotes helix-helix association. Our theoretical models show that the antiparallel association of helices is promoted by favorable electrostatic interactions between α-helix backbone dipole moments. These results contribute to our understanding of the role of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions in determining the association of transmembrane segments in membrane proteins. The implications of these findings for assembly and stability of membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes are also discussed. Materials—1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C18:1c-PC), 1,2-dimyristoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C14:1c-PC), 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C22:1c-PC), and cholesterol were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The pyrene-labeled peptides pyrN-WALP23 (Ac-C(pyrene)-GWW(LA)8LWWA-amide) and pyrC-WALP23 (Ac-GWW(LA)8LWWGC(pyrene)-amide) were synthesized as described earlier (18Sparr E. Ganchev D.N. Snel M.M.E. Ridder A.N.J.A. Kroon-Batenburg L.M.J. Chupin V. Rijkers D.T.S. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The fluorescent probe N-(1-pyrene)maleimide was obtained from Molecular Probes Europe BV (Leiden, The Netherlands). The peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Their identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry and their purity was established by analytical HPLC to be better than 95%. Milli-Q water was used for all experiments. Sample Preparation—Fluorescence experiments were performed on multilamellar vesicles with peptide/lipid ratios between 1/10 and 1/3000. The lipids were dissolved in either chloroform/methanol (1/1) or chloroform, and the peptides were dissolved in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. The concentration of WALP in the stock solution was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21,300 m-1 cm-1. Phospholipids were quantified according to Rouser et al. (19Rouser G. Fleisher S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2852) Google Scholar). Peptides were incorporated into lipid vesicles essentially as described (20de Planque M.R.R. Kruijtzer J.A.W. Liskamp R.M.J. Marsh D. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe R.E. de Kruijff B. Killian J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20839-20846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of peptide and lipids were mixed in the desired peptide/lipid ratio. The solvent was removed by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen and the peptide/lipid film was further dried over-night under vacuum. The mixed films were hydrated in Milli-Q water to a final peptide concentration of 0.25 μm, and the samples were dispersed by vigorous vortexing. The samples were then subjected to 10 cycles of freeze-thawing. The resulting multilamellar vesicles were stored at 4 °C until use. Circular dichroism measurements confirmed that the labeled WALP peptides were incorporated to form stable TM helices in lipid bilayers. Fluorescence Experiments—Fluorescence experiments were performed with an SLM Aminco SPF-500 C fluorimeter. All samples (1.2 ml) were continuously stirred in a 10 × 4-mm quartz cuvette. The temperature was maintained at 22 °C via a water bath with continuous circulation. In addition, the absorbance of each sample was measured at the wavelengths of excitation and emission on a PerkinElmer UV-visual Lambda 18 spectrometer. These data were used to calculate the inner filter effect (21Lakowicz J.R. Principles in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission of pyrene was studied with spectral recordings between 370 and 600 nm (bandwidth 5 nm) with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm (bandwidth 5 nm). The FRET efficiency between Trp and pyrene was determined from the degree of Trp (donor) quenching. Fluorescence spectra were recorded between 320 and 550 nm (bandwidth 5 nm) with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (bandwidth 5 nm). In this assay, both Trp (donor) and pyrene (acceptor) were present in the same peptide, implying that the detected Trp quenching includes contributions both from intermolecular energy transfer and from intramolecular energy transfer. The contribution from the intramolecular Trp quenching was estimated from FRET data obtained for C18:1c-PC vesicles with very low peptide concentrations (0.03-0.2%). In these systems, the Trp quenching was virtually constant, and the intramolecular FRET could therefore be considered constant. The FRET data presented in this study are given as the ratio of the Trp intensity to the intensity where there is only intramolecular energy transfer. Theoretical Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—Fluorescent data were analyzed by means of simulation-based fitting, which produces an approximation of experimental data by a simulated analogue (22Yatskou M.M. Donker H. Koehorst R.B.M. van Hoek A. Schaafsma T.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2001; 345: 141-150Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23Nazarov P.V. Apanasovich V.V. Lutkovski V.M. Yatskou M.M. Koehorst R.B.M. Hemminga M.A. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2004; 44: 568-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the modeling the peptides are assumed to be perfectly α-helical (23Nazarov P.V. Apanasovich V.V. Lutkovski V.M. Yatskou M.M. Koehorst R.B.M. Hemminga M.A. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2004; 44: 568-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the location of the four Trp donors and pyrene acceptors is derived from the primary sequences. The distances from the Cα at the helix backbone to the centers of moiety of the donors and acceptors were estimated to be 3.0 and 6.0 Å, respectively. As a model for peptides incorporated into a lipid bilayer, a square region of a bilayer containing 200 peptides was considered. The peptides were located on the points of a triangular lattice (assuming hexagonal packing) with the closest distance between points set to 10 Å. Lipids were not explicitly included in the model, however, their average diameter (7.5 Å) and the peptide/lipid ratio were used to define the final size of the peptide-lipid model. Peptides were randomly directed with the helix axis of the peptide either parallel or antiparallel to the normal of the membrane. For each i-th donor in this model, the probability of energy transfer to one of the acceptors is given by the following equation, piET=∑j(R0/Ri,j)61+∑j(R0/Ri,j)6(Eq. 1) where Ri,j is the distance between the i-th donor and j-th acceptor in the system, and R0 is the Förster distance, which was set to 28 Å (21Lakowicz J.R. Principles in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). The summation runs over all the acceptors in the system. The mean value <pET > for all donors gives the total energy transfer efficiency in the peptide-lipid model. The protein insertion and FRET simulation were repeated 50 times and averaged to give the final result. Computer Modeling and Structure Prediction—Dimers of WALP23 (Ac-GWW(LA)8LWWA-amide) were modeled with a simulated annealing modeling protocol (24Nilges M. Brunger A.T. Proteins. 1993; 15: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), using the force field and methodology previously described (25Ash W.L. Stockner T. MacCallum J.L. Tieleman D.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9050-9060Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We performed four different modeling runs in which the peptides were either oriented parallel or antiparallel to each other, and in which the helix dipole moments were either treated normally or artificially reversed. The latter was done by reversing the sign of the partial charges on all C=O and N-H backbone atoms on one helix. This backbone treatment did not detectably alter the structure of individual helices (not shown). The modeling runs were labeled AA, PP, AP, and PA, where the first letter denoted the physical orientation and the second the dipole orientation. Thus AP and PA had helix dipole moments that were uncoupled from packing. Each starting structure was a pair of ideal α-helices, 1.04 nm apart. Thirteen starting orientations, generated from evenly distributed symmetric rotations of the helices around their main axes, were used to generate 125 structures each, resulting in a total of 1625 structures for each model. Extremely high-energy structures resulting from instabilities during annealing were discarded, amounting to less than 20 structures for each case. In all cases, the last turn of the helix had its four unsatisfied hydrogen bond donors or acceptors “turned off” by setting the partial charge of both atoms in the N-H or C=O moieties to zero. This was done to restrict unrealistically strong electrostatic interactions between the unshielded termini, which would ordinarily be solvated by water or involved in interactions with the lipid head groups. Crossing angles and helix-helix separation distances were calculated using the TWISTER algorithm (26Strelkov S.V. Burkhard P. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), averaged over 8 center-most residues. We calculated the propensity for each amino acid to reside in the helix-helix interface by summing intermolecular contacts by residue type. The interhelical contact values indicate the total number of residues of a particular type, in the entire 1625 structure ensemble, that formed one or more intermolecular contacts with an atom-atom distance less than 0.4 nm, a value determined empirically with visual inspection of the resulting interface definitions. Multiple contacts made by a single residue (uniquely defined in terms of dimer model number, monomer, and sequence position) were only counted once. Clustering followed a two-tiered protocol. Initial clusters were assigned based on crossing angle, helix-helix separation distance, and the fraction of buried Ala calculated as described above. These primary clusters were refined with a second round of clustering based on atomic coordinates. For the initial coarse-level clustering, Hierarchical Clustering Explorer 3.0 (27Seo J. Shneiderman B. Proc. IEEE Inf. Vis. 2004; 2004: 65-72Google Scholar) was used with average linkage clustering and the Euclidian distance similarity scoring function on normalized data. The minimum similarity cut-off was set to 0.901, chosen to yield at least 20-30 clusters for each data set. All clusters containing more than 100 members were selected and subclustered based on the root mean square deviation (r.m.s. deviation) of the atomic coordinates of all non-hydrogen atoms between least-squares fit structures, using the program NMRCLUST (28Kelley L.A. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and an r.m.s. deviation cut-off of 0.3 nm. A subset of the data, corresponding to the first 40 structures generated for each initial starting orientation of the helices (or 520 structures for each model), was also clustered using the r.m.s. deviation-based method with NMRCLUST. This subset analysis was conducted as a check against the two-tier process described above. Helix-Helix Association as Analyzed by Pyrene Excimer Fluorescence—We investigated the interactions between Trp-flanked TM α-helices by using pyrene-labeled WALP peptides. The pyrene monomer exhibits a characteristic fluorescence emission spectrum with three maxima at wavelengths between 375 and 420 nm. When two pyrene rings are in close contact with each other, they form an excited state dimer (excimer), which exhibits a unique fluorescence peak at a wavelength of about 490 nm. The helix-helix interaction was first studied in multilamellar vesicles consisting of C18:1c-PC and the N-terminal labeled peptide pyrN-WALP23 at peptide/lipid ratios ranging from 1/3000 to 1/10. Surprisingly, the recorded pyrene emission spectra showed no dependence on the peptide/lipid ratio. Only the monomer emission peak was observed, and excimer formation could not even be detected at high peptide concentrations (Fig. 1). This suggests that there is no interaction between peptides that are oriented parallel to each other. However, interactions between helices oriented antiparallel with respect to each other are not detectable with this experiment. To investigate this possibility, we included two differently labeled WALP analogues in the assay, one labeled at the N terminus (pyrN-WALP23), as described above, and one labeled at the C terminus (pyrC-WALP23). Fig. 2, A and B, shows the pyrene emission spectra for samples with a peptide/lipid ratio of 1/10. The pyrene emission for samples containing only pyrC-WALP23 was translated to slightly lower wavelengths than that of pyrN-WALP23 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the C terminus of the peptide exists in a slightly more hydrophobic environment (21Lakowicz J.R. Principles in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar) in the lipid bilayer. This is consistent with data from mass spectrometry (29Demmers J.A.A. Haverkamp J. Heck A.J.R. Koeppe R.E. Killian J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3189-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which showed that the C terminus is more protected from exchange than the N terminus, and from ESR measurements, suggesting that the peptide is slightly shifted with respect to the middle of the membrane (30Nielsen R.D. Che K. Gelb M.H. Robinson B.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 6430-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Importantly, excimer formation was not observed when only one type of these peptides was present, but when pyrN-WALP23 and pyrC-WALP23 were both present, excimer formation was observed (Fig. 2B). Maximum excimer intensity was obtained for the equimolar mixture of pyrN-WALP23 and pyrC-WALP23 (Fig. 2C). In principle, it is possible that these results are simply because of more favorable excimer formation by pyrene moieties in antiparallel peptides than in parallel peptides. However, this is unlikely, because we have previously shown that excimer formation also occurs in parallel peptides under certain conditions (18Sparr E. Ganchev D.N. Snel M.M.E. Ridder A.N.J.A. Kroon-Batenburg L.M.J. Chupin V. Rijkers D.T.S. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, the most straightforward interpretation of our data is that there is only direct contact between antiparallel helices. Next, pyrene fluorescence measurements were performed for samples with varying peptide/lipid ratios, ranging from 1/3000 to 1/10. The relationship between the excimer/monomer ratio (E/M) and the peptide concentration is shown in Fig. 2D. Excimer formation was detected at high peptide concentrations (peptide/lipid ratios above 1/25), and only when both types of peptides were present. The influence of hydrophobic mismatch on helix-helix interactions was investigated by comparing the pyrene fluorescence for peptides incorporated in vesicles consisting of C14:1c-PC (positive hydrophobic mismatch) or C22:1c-PC (negative hydrophobic mismatch) to those obtained for C18:1c-PC (hydrophobic match). Fig. 3A shows the pyrene emission spectra obtained for a peptide/lipid ratio of 1/25. We observed an increase in excimer intensity when there was hydrophobic mismatch between the peptides and the lipid bilayer. Excimer formation was also detected at slightly lower peptide concentrations than in the matching situation, with an offset at a peptide/lipid ratio of ∼1/30 (Fig. 3B). This demonstrates that peptide aggregation is slightly promoted by hydrophobic mismatch. No difference was detected between the situations of negative and positive mismatch. Excimer formation only occurred when both types of peptides were present, indicating a preferred anti-parallel organization of the interacting peptides regardless of the extent of hydrophobic mismatch. Finally, increased peptide association was observed when WALP peptides were incorporated in C18:1c-PC bilayers that included 40% cholesterol (Fig. 4). This effect can be attributed to the increased hydrophobic mismatch because of thickening of the bilayer, as well as the increased lipid acyl chain order and the reduced area per phosphatidylcholine head group in the presence of cholesterol (31Vist M.R. Davis J.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Helix-Helix Association as Analyzed by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—The interaction between helices was also investigated by FRET between Trp and pyrene, both of which are present in the labeled WALP peptides. The degree of Trp quenching increased at high peptide concentrations (Fig. 5A). These experiments were not expected to be sensitive to the antiparallel or parallel orientations of the interacting helices, as the peptides are flanked with Trp on both ends. Indeed, similar results were obtained when only one type of peptide, pyrN-WALP23 or pyrC-WALP23, was present, or when a mixture of peptides was present (data not shown). From this we can conclude that the labeling does not influence peptide-peptide interactions in a detectable way, and that helix association is not promoted by favorable pyrene interactions in one situation or the other. The intermolecular FRET was also observed for bilayers of different thickness (Fig. 5B). Trp quenching was more efficient when the peptides were incorporated in bilayers of C14:1c-PC and C22:1c-PC, compared with when the peptides were present in vesicles composed of C18:1c-PC. This is consistent with the results of our pyrene excimer fluorescence measurements. Our observation that the Trp quenching increases with increasing peptide/lipid ratios implies a decreasing distance between the donors (Trp) and the acceptors (pyrene) (Fig. 5B). However, the experimental FRET data cannot be directly utilized to judge whether this effect is because of direct association between the peptides, or simply a consequence of the increased amount of randomly distributed peptides in the bilayer. To further investigate this, we performed a theoretical analysis of the same system, where the FRET was calculated for simulated systems with a random distribution of peptides and no intrinsic peptide-peptide association. The calculated FRET data (Fig. 5B, dashed line) show a good agreement in the case of the C18:1c-PC vesicles, suggesting that the peptides are randomly distributed in the bilayer. However, unlike the real FRET measurements, the calculated FRET was found to be independent of the bilayer thickness (data not shown). Thus, the deviation between the experimental data and the calculated FRET in the situation of hydrophobic mismatch indicates that peptide aggregation is promoted when there is hydrophobic mismatch between the peptide and the lipids. This increase in peptide aggregation is only observed at peptide/lipid ratios above 1/30. At lower peptide concentrations the resemblance between the calculated and experimental FRET indicates random distribution of peptides in the bilayer, even in the case of hydrophobic mismatch. Furthermore, both the experimental and the calculated data show that the FRET is the same whether the peptide is labeled at the N or the C terminus. Computer Modeling and Structure Prediction—We investigated the physical principles underlying WALP23 dimer formation and the molecular nature of these dimers with four computational models of both antiparallel and parallel dimers with both natural and modified backbone dipole arrangements. Interhelical separation distances and crossing angles in the models depended on the arrangement of the helix dipoles but not on whether the helices were physically parallel or anti-parallel (Fig. 6A). Parallel dipoles resulted in greater interhelical separation (∼1.1 nm) and larger crossing angles (±30°), antiparallel dipoles promoted closer packing (∼0.8 nm) and a narrower distribution of crossing angles (with a peak near 0°). The identity of residues involved in inter-helical contacts also showed a dependence on the helix dipole orientation (TABLE ONE). Parallel dipoles resulted in a greater percentage of Leu contac"

CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is an Hsp70-associated ubiquitin ligase that participates in this process by ubiquitylating misfolded proteins associated with cytoplasmic chaperones. Mechanisms that regulate the activity of CHIP are, at present, poorly understood. Using a proteomics approach, we have identified BAG2, a previously uncharacterized BAG domain-containing protein, as a common component of CHIP holocomplexes in vivo. Binding assays indicate that BAG2 associates with CHIP as part of a ternary complex with Hsc70, and BAG2 colocalizes with CHIP under both quiescent conditions and after heat shock. In vitro and in vivo ubiquitylation assays indicate that BAG2 is an efficient and specific inhibitor of CHIP-dependent ubiquitin ligase activity. This activity is due, in part, to inhibition of interactions between CHIP and its cognate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UbcH5a, which may in turn be facilitated by ATP-dependent remodeling of the BAG2-Hsc70-CHIP heterocomplex. The association of BAG2 with CHIP provides a cochaperone-dependent regulatory mechanism for preventing unregulated ubiquitylation of misfolded proteins by CHIP.

The association of BAG2 with CHIP provides a cochaperone-dependent regulatory mechanism for preventing unregulated ubiquitylation of misfolded proteins by CHIP. Cell viability is constantly threatened by protein misfolding within the cytoplasm due to imprecise de novo protein folding and the consequences of oxidative and thermal stresses and conformational chain reaction events that affect protein structure. Because of the cellular inefficiencies and toxicities associated with off-pathway protein conformations, tightly regulated systems have evolved to minimize protein misfolding. The molecular chaperones constitute one component of the cytoplasmic protein quality control process. These proteins (including Hsp70, Hsp90, TRiC, and other associated proteins) assist in cotranslational folding, maintain metastable protein conformations, and repair proteins that are structurally defective. The molecular regulation and coordination of cytoplasmic folding and refolding are becoming increasingly clear (1.Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). In addition to promoting proper folding, a second requirement of protein quality control mechanisms is the efficient removal of proteins that are irreversibly damaged or extremely toxic. Degradation of misfolded proteins occurs predominantly through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. For proteins that are misfolded within the endoplasmic reticulum, the protein degradation pathways are well described (2.Sitia R. Braakman I. Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Less is known about degradation of misfolded proteins within the cytoplasm. Recently, the co-chaperone/ubiquitin ligase CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) has been implicated in the degradation of a variety of chaperone-bound cytoplasmic proteins (3.Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 4.Meacham G. Patterson C. Zhang W. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). CHIP inhibits the ATPase activity of Hsp70 (5.Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and has U box-dependent ubiquitin ligase activity that targets a range of chaperone substrates for proteasome-dependent degradation (6.Cyr D.M. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 7.Hohfeld J. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The proteins that are marked for degradation by CHIP include substrates of Hsp70 (such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 3The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; TOF, time of flight.), Hsp90 (ErbB2), and nonnative misfolded proteins that bind cytoplasmic chaperones (4.Meacham G.

Dimerization is a necessary step for this ubiquitin ligase activity, at least in vitro (11.Nikolay R. Wiederkehr T. Rist W. Kramer G. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A general model has been developed, which suggests that recruitment of CHIP to chaperone holocomplexes converts the chaperone machinery to a degradation-competent status to facilitate the removal of misfolded proteins (6.Cyr D.M. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 7.Hohfeld J. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 12.Patterson, C. (2002) Sci. STKE 2002, PE4Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that CHIP participates in the protein degradation pathway for misfolded, but not active, estrogen receptor (13.Tateishi Y. Kawabe Y.-I. Chiba T. Murata S. Ichikawa K. Murayama A. Tanaka K. Baba T. Kato S. Yanagisawa J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4813-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) supports this model. What remains unclear is how chaperone holocomplexes are remodeled to regulate the activity of CHIP, which, due to its constitutive expression, could be prone to ubiquitylate proteins on the proper folding pathway unnecessarily if its activity were unrestrained. In addition, it is also not certain how decisions are made by a chaperone complex to either refold or degrade a protein, a process referred to as “protein triage” (14.Wickner S. Maurizi M. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). To resolve these questions, we have performed mass spectrometry to determine the components of endogenous CHIP complexes. We have found that BAG2 is present in cytoplasmic chaperone complexes that contain CHIP and is an endogenous inhibitor of CHIP ubiquitin ligase activity, at least partly, by interfering with CHIP-ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme interactions, thus providing a cochaperone-dependent mechanism for regulating CHIP activity. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-CHIP and anti-BAG2 antibodies were described previously (5.Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Hsc70 (SPA 816) was from Stressgen. Mouse anti-CHIP monoclonal antibody (colony 67) was produced in collaboration with the University of North Carolina Monoclonal Antibody Core Facility. Mouse CFTR NBD1-R domain-specific antibody (monoclonal antibody 1660) was from R&D Systems, and the MM13-4 anti-CFTR antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-rat fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-mouse Texas Red fluorescent antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cell Culture and Transfection—To generate stable transfectants, pcDNA3-Myc-CHIP or pcDNA3 alone was transfected into HeLa cells cultured on 100-mm plates. 48 h after transfection, cells were split, and G418 was added at a working concentration of 400 μg/ml. Two weeks after transfection, G418-resistant colonies were isolated with cloning rings and screened for expression by Western blotting. For transient transfections, HEK293 cells were transfected with equivalent concentrations of CFTRΔF508, CHIP, and BAG2 plasmids using Effectene (Qiagen) at a DNA/Effectene ratio of 1:5. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer 24 h after transfection, and CFTR protein levels were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Mass Spectrometry Detection of CHIP-associated Proteins—HeLa cells stably expressing Myc-CHIP were cultured in 150-mm plates to confluence. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Anti-Myc-agarose (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the cell lysates. Agarose beads were then spun down at 500 × g for 3 min and washed five times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. 2× SDS sample buffer was added to the beads and boiled. After pulse spinning, the supernatants were loaded onto SDS-PAGE. Silver staining was performed using the Invitrogen SilverQuest kit according to standard instructions. Individual gel bands were excised according to protocols described previously (15.Borchers C. Peter J.F. Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Tomer K.B. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the proteins were digested in gel and analyzed by combined mass spectrometric approaches. Briefly, the gels were subjected to trypsin proteolysis using a ProGest automated digester (Genomics Solutions). The extracted peptides were analyzed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-TOF/TOF spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) and an ESI Q-TOF spectrometer (API-US Micromass) equipped with a capillary LC system from Waters. Data were submitted to the MASCOT data base search engine (Matrix-Science) for protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting and sequence tag approaches. Preparation of Expression Constructs—pGEX-4T-1 BAG2 was previously described (16.Takayama S. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E237-E241Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Full-length BAG2 was subcloned into pcDNA3-HA for mammalian expression. PCR was performed to generate BAG2 4-90 and 91-211 fragments and cloned into pcDNA3-HA and pGEX-6P-1. His-Hsc70, Myc-CHIP, and GST-CHIP plasmids were described previously (5.Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Recombinant proteins were produced in BL21(DE3)RP cells (Stratagene). The cells were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 5 h. The cultures were spun down at 4 °C, dissolved in GST lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), sonicated, and cleared by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads at 4 °C for 2 h and washed with GST lysis buffer with 0.5% Triton four times. In some experiments, the GST tag was cleaved with Precision protease (Amersham Biosciences) for pGEX-6P-1 constructs or thrombin for PGEX-4T-1 constructs. For purification of His-Hsc70, bacterial cultures were lysed in His lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm benzamidine) and purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). Recombinant NBD1-R, CHIP, Hsp70, Hdj2, and UbcH5a were purified as previously described (17.Younger J.M. Ren H.-Y. Chen L. Fan C.-Y. Fields A. Patterson C. Cyr D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In Vitro Ubiquitylation Reactions—In vitro ubiquitylation of CFTR NBD1-R domain was performed as described previously (17.Younger J.M. Ren H.-Y. Chen L. Fan C.-Y. Fields A. Patterson C. Cyr D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 μg of purified CFTR-NBD domain was incubated with 4 μm CHIP, 0.4-20 μm BAG1 or BAG2, 2 μm Hsp70, 4 μm Hdj2, 0.3 μg of purified rabbit E1 (Calbiochem), 1 mg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma), and 8 μm UbcH4 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol for 3 h at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-CFTR NBD1-R domain or anti-Hsp70 antibodies. Nucleotide Exchange Activity—Measurement of nucleotide exchange was determined using previously described methods (5.Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of Hsc70 was incubated with an equimolar concentration of recombinant BAG1, BAG2, or BAG2 deletion mutants in 25 μl of buffer (20 mm Hepes, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Under these conditions, ATP is hydrolyzed, and ADP dissociation can be measured. At the indicated times, aliquots (2 μl) were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on Selecto Cellulose polyethyleneimine sheets using 1 m formic acid plus 1 m LiCl. Unlabeled ATP and ADP were run simultaneously as standards and identified by UV light. Sheets were dried and exposed to film, and binding of ATP and ADP was determined by densitometry. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as bound ADP as a percentage of total. Nucleotide Binding Assays—Measurement of nucleotide species bound to Hsp70, CHIP, or BAG2 was performed by [α-32P]8-N3ATP photolabeling. 0.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.3 μg of CHIP, 0.4 μg of BAG2, or 0.5 μg of Hsp70 (to keep equimolar amounts of proteins in each reaction) was incubated with 1 μCi of [α-32P]8-N3ATP (10-15 Ci/mmol) in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were irradiated with a UV transilluminator for 2 min. Nucleotides bound to proteins were then separated from the free nucleotides by size exclusion chromatography using a G50 spin column. 1 μl of the flow-through were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. GST Pull-down Assays—Glutathione-Sepharose-bound proteins were incubated with purified proteins for 2 h at 4°C with continuous rotation in GST lysis buffer. The beads were washed four times with GST lysis buffer containing 400 mm NaCl. Beads were then boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer and loaded on SDS-PAGE. For His-Hsc70 binding assays, binding reactions were performed in His lysis buffer with purified BAG2 and CHIP. When indicated, some experiments were performed in the absence or presence of ATP, ADP, or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP (5 mm). Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells transiently transfected with HA-BAG2 and Myc-CHIP or HeLa cells stably transfected with Myc-CHIP at levels similar to endogenous protein were grown on coverslips. The cells were subjected to 30 min of heat shock at 42 °C, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and then stained with appropriate antibodies to detect CHIP and BAG2 in the two cell types: mouse anti-Myc (9E10) and rabbit anti-HA in the HEK293 cells and mouse anti-Myc and rabbit anti-BAG2 antisera in HeLa cells. Secondary antibodies were Alexafluor goat anti-mouse 488 and Alexafluor goat anti-rabbit 568. Images were acquired on an Olympus 500 Fluoroview confocal microscope. All images are at ×60 magnification. Identification of CHIP-associated Proteins by Mass Spectrometry—We created stable HeLa cell lines expressing Myc-tagged CHIP at levels approximating endogenous expression or cells transfected with the parent vector alone (Fig. 1A). Low level expression of the transgene avoided CHIP-dependent induction of heat shock factor-1 (18.Dai Q. Zhang C. Wu Y. McDonough H. Whaley R.A. Godfrey V. Madamanchi N. Xu W. Neckers L. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5446-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Lysates from these cell lines were probed with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, and immunocomplexes were resolved by electrophoresis followed by silver staining to detect individual components. Representative immunocomplexes are shown in Fig. 1B. Individual bands were excised and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-TOF/TOF and ESI Q-TOF (15.Borchers C. Peter J.F. Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Tomer K.B. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations, peptides representing Hsc/Hsp70 and CHIP were identified in bands of the appropriate molecular weights, indicating that CHIP associates with chaperones and homodimerizes (5.Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 11.Nikolay R. Wiederkehr T. Rist W. Kramer G. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, a 28-kDa band was identified that was present in approximate stoichiometry with Hsc70 in CHIP immunocomplexes. Six of six resolvable spectra coded fragments of BAG2. Using an anti-BAG2 antibody, we confirmed that BAG2 was specifically and highly enriched in CHIP immunocomplexes (Fig. 1C). BAG2 is one of six proteins in mammals that contain the BAG domain. The BAG domain was originally identified in BAG1, a BCL2 partner protein that was subsequently confirmed to associate with Hsc70 (19.Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 20.Takayama S. Bimstone D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BAG1 has also been implicated in CHIP-dependent protein degradation (8.Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Hohfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), although we did not discover BAG1 in these experiments or in other tests for endogenous CHIP interaction partners (data not shown). BAG domain proteins possess general nucleotide exchange activities toward Hsc/Hsp70 (16.Takayama S. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E237-E241Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar); therefore, they may each regulate chaperone activities under specific conditions. BAG2 contains the most divergent BAG domain among this family at its carboxyl terminus, and the 90 amino-proximal residues contain no motifs recognized by the SMART and PFAM algorithms. No cellular functions have been assigned to this protein to date. We used several different approaches to characterize the interaction between CHIP and BAG2. Using GST-CHIP in pull-down assays with recombinant proteins, we found that BAG2 could be efficiently precipitated with CHIP, but only when Hsp70 was also present in the reaction (Fig. 2A). In converse experiments, GST-BAG2 precipitated CHIP in an Hsp70-dependent fashion (Fig. 2B). Deletions of either the BAG domain (amino acids 91-211) or the amino-terminal extension (amino acids 4-90) revealed that the BAG domain recruited both Hsp70 and CHIP, but with markedly lower efficiency than native BAG2, suggesting an additional role for the BAG2 amino terminus in efficient complex assembly. Finally, we used nickel chromatography to isolate recombinant proteins associating with His-tagged Hsc70. Both CHIP and BAG2 bound Hsc70 efficiently and without competition (Fig. 2C). For reasons discussed below, it is important to note that the preceding experiments were done in the absence of ATP. Taken together, they indicate the assembly of a CHIP-Hsp·Hsc70-BAG2 complex in which Hsp70 serves as a bridge linking CHIP and BAG2 and that depends on the BAG domain of BAG2. This complex appears to be further stabilized by interactions involving the amino terminus of BAG2 binding to other sites within this complex; these interactions were explored further in subsequent studies (see below). Colocalization of BAG2 and CHIP in Vivo—CHIP has a characteristic and dynamic pattern of localization in cultured cells. Under quiescent conditions, it is localized in the cytoplasm and is strikingly concentrated at the outer membrane of the ER (5.Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar); after heat shock, a significant amount of CHIP undergoes nuclear import (18.Dai Q. Zhang C. Wu Y. McDonough H. Whaley R.A. Godfrey V. Madamanchi N. Xu W. Neckers L. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5446-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). If BAG2 regulates CHIP under endogenous conditions, then its expression and distribution after stress should mirror that of CHIP. BAG2 exhibited a similar pattern of distribution to CHIP in cultured HeLa cells and when transfected ectopically into HEK293 cells under quiescent conditions (Fig. 3). After heat shock, BAG2 translocated into the nucleus with temporal kinetics that mirror those of CHIP. The tight correlation of expression suggests that BAG2 and CHIP may undergo coordinated intracellular transport, perhaps as part of the same complex, and puts BAG2 in a position to regulate any of the activities so far assigned to CHIP. BAG2 Inhibits the Ubiquitin Ligase Activity of CHIP—CHIP has two well defined functions in regulating cytoplasmic quality control; CHIP directly activates heat shock factor-1 (which transcriptionally regulates molecular chaperones) (18.Dai Q. Zhang C. Wu Y. McDonough H. Whaley R.A. Godfrey V. Madamanchi N. Xu W. Neckers L. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5446-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and CHIP is a co-chaperone/ubiquitin ligase (21.Jiang J. Ballinger C. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Using a variety of assays, we did not identify any consistent affects of BAG2 on CHIP-dependent heat shock factor-1 activation (data not shown). However, we found that in vitro ubiquitylation of the NBD1 domain of CFTR by CHIP was efficiently inhibited by BAG2 (Fig. 4A). Half-maximal effects of BAG2 occurred at roughly stoichiometric concentrations of BAG2 relative to CHIP. Hsp70 itself is also a ubiquitylation target of CHIP (21.Jiang J. Ballinger C. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and BAG2 similarly blocked the addition of ubiquitin residues to this protein (Fig. 4B). We tested the specificity of this inhibitory activity by deleting the BAG domain of BAG2, which totally abolished its inhibitory activity toward CHIP (data not shown). Since BAG1 has been placed in complexes with CHIP in in vitro studies (8.Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Hohfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), we compared the activity of BAG2 with BAG1 in these assays. Even at 10-fold higher concentrations compared with BAG2, BAG1 had negligible effects on CHIP ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig. 4C). These results are consistent with previous tests of BAG1 function (8.Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Hohfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and indicate that the presence of a BAG domain alone is insufficient to inhibit CHIP activity. In addition, these experiments confirm the specificity of BAG2 as an inhibitor of CHIP ubiquitin ligase activity in this assay. To explore the effects of BAG2 in vivo, we examined its activity on a known CHIP ubiquitylation target. CHIP efficiently reduces steady state levels of the CFTRΔF508 mutant by targeting it for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation (4.Meacham G. Patterson C. Zhang W. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). We therefore expressed CFTRΔF508 in HEK293 cells and tested the effects of CHIP and BAG2 on its expression. As has been demonstrated previously (4.Meacham G. Patterson C. Zhang W. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), CHIP reduced CFTRΔF508 levels (Fig. 4D). Consistent with its role in inhibiting CHIP activity, BAG2 overcame the effects of CHIP on CFTRΔF508 and markedly increased CFTRΔF508 expression, which is under constitutive control by endogenous CHIP, both in the presence and absence of ectopic CHIP expression. In contrast, overexpression of BAG1 under similar conditions did not rescue CFTRΔF508 expression, indicating specificity for BAG2 in these studies (Fig. 4E). These experiments are consistent with our in vitro observations and indicate that BAG2 prevents CHIP-dependent diversion of CFTRΔF508 to the proteasome-dependent quality control pathway. Interestingly, we did not identify any indication that BAG2 is itself a target for CHIP-dependent ubiquitylation under the conditions in which these in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed (data not shown). To further characterize the participation of BAG2 in CHIP-dependent ubiquitylation, we examined the activity of the amino terminus and BAG domains of BAG2. First, we assessed the activities of BAG2 and the deletion mutants BAG2 4-90 and BAG2 91-211 in regulating nucleotide exchange with Hsp70. Consistent with previous observations, BAG2 inhibited nucleotide exchange with potency equivalent to BAG1 (22.Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), an effect that was abolished by deletion of the BAG domain but not the amino terminus of BAG2 (Fig. 5A). We then tested the activity of the same proteins for their ability to inhibit CHIP-dependent ubiquitylation of CFTR NBD1. In contrast with its effect on nucleotide exchange, the BAG domain of BAG2 alone (BAG2 91-211) did not inhibit ubiquitylation of NBD1, nor did BAG1, even when present in 10-fold excess relative to CHIP (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results indicate that the inhibitory effects of BAG2 are not strictly due to nucleotide exchange activity and that the amino terminus of BAG2 is required for its inhibitory effects on the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP. BAG2-dependent Remodeling of the CHIP Ubiquitin Ligase Complex—Based on our current understanding of CHIP activity, we considered several plausible mechanisms for the potent antagonistic effects of BAG2. Because CHIP dimerization is required for its ubiquitin ligase activity (11.Nikolay R. Wiederkehr T. Rist W. Kramer G. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we tested whether BAG2 disrupted CHIP-CHIP dimers. To do this, we co-expressed both Myc- and FLAG-tagged CHIP and used the different tags to assay CHIP dimerization by co-immunoprecipitation in cultured cells. CHIP dimers were easily detected under these conditions, and BAG2 was readily incorporated into complexes containing these dimers, but (even at saturating levels of BAG2 expression) CHIP dimerization was not disrupted (Fig. 6A). We next characterized the nucleotide dependence of the association of BAG2 and Hsp70 with CHIP by incubating GST-CHIP (or deletion mutants thereof) with recombinant BAG2 and Hsp70 (Fig. 6B). Consistent with our previous observations (5.Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), Hsp70 binding required the tetratricopeptide repeat and adjacent charged domains of CHIP (amino acids 1-197). When binding reactions were performed in the absence of ATP, the binding of BAG2 to CHIP followed the same binding rules as does Hsp70, which is consistent with observations in Fig. 2. Surprisingly, in the presence of ATP, a lower affinity interaction of BAG2 with the U-box domain of CHIP was also observed that was independent of Hsp70 binding. Concomitant with this association, we found that BAG2 was released from Hsp70 in preformed Hsp70-BAG2-CHIP complexes by adenine nucleotides in binding assays of recombinant proteins using GST-BAG2; however, only ATP (and not ADP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP) caused retention of CHIP in the Hsp70-depleted GST-BAG2 complexes (Fig. 6C). The nucleotide dependence of this reaction raised the question of which of these proteins bound to ATP. We tested this by 8-azido-ATP photolabeling, a sensitive index of ATP binding (Fig. 6D). As expected, ATP photoreacted with Hsp70 but not with CHIP or BAG2. Similar results were observed with ATP affinity chromatography (not shown). Taken together, these observations provided further evidence that direct interactions between BAG2 and CHIP occur. This remodeling of the Hsp70-BAG2-CHIP heterocomplex requires nucleotide binding to dissociate BAG2 from Hsp70 and (based on the effects of AMP-PNP) Hsp70-dependent nucleotide hydrolysis to facilitate the BAG2-CHIP interaction. The release of Hsp70 from BAG2-CHIP complexes in the presence of ATP, as indicated in Fig. 6C, suggested that one mechanism to account for inhibition of CHIP by BAG2 is through dissociation of Hsp70 that is required for substrate presentation to CHIP. We therefore performed additional binding assays under the same conditions as our in vitro ubiquitylation reactions (Fig. 4) in an ATP-containing system. Under these conditions, and in contrast to the effects in the absence of ATP (see Fig. 2), BAG2 disrupted the association between CHIP and Hsp70 (Fig. 7A) in a concentration dependence that was analogous to its effect on CHIP ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig. 4A). In contrast, and despite the fact that it has equivalent effects on Hsp70 nucleotide exchange (Fig. 5A), BAG1 had little effect on CHIP-Hsp70 interactions, even at relatively high molar ratios (Fig. 7B). Consistent with this observation, BAG1 did not “rescue” CHIP from BAG2-dependent suppression of its ubiquitin ligase activity in in vitro assays (data not shown). We also found that BAG2 disrupted the association of CHIP and endogenous Hsc/Hsp70 in vivo (Fig. 7C). By disrupting the ability of Hsp70 to present substrates to CHIP, this ATP-dependent remodeling of the CHIP complex would have the expected effect of inhibiting its ubiquitin ligase activity toward substrates, as we observe in our in vitro and in vivo studies (Fig. 4). BAG2 Disrupts CHIP E2-E3 Coupling—Given the indications of discrete contacts between BAG2 and the U-box of CHIP in these complexes (Fig. 6B), we further considered whether other aspects of ubiquitin ligase complex assembly were perturbed when BAG2 was present in these complexes. We have previously observed that stable interactions between CHIP and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH5a are necessary for ubiquitin ligase activity (21.Jiang J. Ballinger C. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Incorporation of BAG2 into CHIP complexes in the presence of ATP destabilized this interaction (Fig. 8A), preventing E2-E3 coupling that is required for ubiquitin chain assembly. Similarly, UbcH5a reversed BAG2-dependent stabilization of CFTRΔF508 and competitively released BAG2 from CHIP immunocomplexes in HEK293 cells (Fig. 8B), which supports a model in which UbcH5a and Bag2 compete (directly or indirectly) for binding to the U-box of CHIP. Given the proximity of BAG2 and CHIP within the chaperone-ubiquitin ligase holocomplex, this activity provides an additional mechanism for inhibition of chaperone substrate ubiquitylation. Taken together, our observations suggest that BAG2 exerts a check-point mechanism that may prevent dysregulated ubiquitylation of chaperone substrates. Molecular chaperones require coordinated interactions with multiple co-chaperones to regulate the steps in protein folding. We have speculated that chaperone-dependent protein degradation is regulated with equivalent precision. Based on the growing appreciation for the role of CHIP in chaperone-dependent protein degradation, we immunopurified endogenous CHIP complexes with the goal of identifying the range of proteins that regulate the CHIP-Hsp70 complex. BAG2 is a prominent component of CHIP-containing holocomplexes, suggesting that it plays an endogenous role in regulating diversion of chaperone substrates to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for degradation. BAG2 is one of six mammalian proteins containing carboxyl-terminal BAG domains. Many of the BAG domain proteins possess antiapoptotic activities (although presumably through nonoverlapping mechanisms) (16.Takayama S. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E237-E241Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 23.Doong H. Vrailas A. Kohn E.C. Cancer Lett. 2002; 188: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and all of them interact with the ATPase domain of Hsc70 in a BAG domain-dependent mechanism (22.Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). It seems most likely that the principal biochemical effect of BAG-Hsc70 interactions is to facilitate nucleotide exchange (24.Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Hohfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 25.Brehmer D. Rudiger S. Gassler C.S. Klostermeier D. Packschies L. Reinstein J. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), although analyses of BAG1 suggest that nucleotide exchange may not comprise the entirety of BAG domain protein activities toward Hsp70 (26.Bimston D. Song J. Winchester D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6871-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the consequences of BAG domain protein effects on Hsp70 can be modulated both by stoichiometric considerations and by structural features within the amino-terminal extension adjacent to the BAG domain (27.Gassler C.S. Wiederkehr T. Brehmer D. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32538-32544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28.Luders J. Demand J. Höhfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that BAG domain proteins undergo conformational regulation that coordinates interactions among partner proteins (16.Takayama S. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E237-E241Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), an effect that at least in some cases is ATP-dependent (28.Luders J. Demand J. Höhfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that BAG2 is a major component of the Hsc70-CHIP chaperone-dependent ubiquitin ligase complex, and our observation that amino terminus sequences in BAG2 stabilize the ternary BAG2-Hsc70-CHIP complex (Fig. 2B) suggests that these sequences may form protein-protein interactions within this complex (in addition to the BAG-ATPase domain interaction) to tune the molecular functions of this complex. Consistent with this model, BAG2 directly interacts with the U-box domain of CHIP in an ATP-dependent fashion (Fig. 6B) and remodels these complexes such that Hsp70 is excluded (Fig. 7). The ability of BAG2 (but not BAG1) to suppress UbcH5a interactions with CHIP (Fig. 8) raises the interesting possibility that the amino terminus of BAG2 sterically hinders this association, although at the present time, we cannot exclude the possibility that BAG2 also has conformational effects on the complex that determine the rules of E2-E3 association (Fig. 9). The present studies provide an important basis for beginning to understand how decisions about protein triage are made at the level of individual chaperone complexes. Until now, no mechanism has existed to explain how CHIP is prevented from ubiquitin-tagging proteins on the proper folding pathway for degradation. Our results indicate that BAG2 is likely to play a constitutive regulatory role in this decision. The close intracellular co-localization of CHIP and BAG2 under conditions of quiescence and thermal challenge suggests that coordination of CHIP activity by BAG2 is an ongoing process within the cell (Fig. 3). How this association is regulated is an open question at this time, although our data indicate that BAG2 interactions are clearly nucleotide-dependent. It is also likely that other events regulate the activity of this complex. In this regard, it is interesting to note that BAG2 was identified in an inductive proteomic screen for targets of p38 MAP kinase activity (29.Ueda K. Kosako H. Fukui Y. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41815-41821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, we did not find that the effects of BAG2 on CHIP were altered by pharmacologic inhibitors or activators of p38 (data not shown). It is also plausible that other proteins compete for the ability of BAG2 to join CHIP-Hsp70 complexes; an analogous competition between BAG1, Raf-1, and Hsp70 has been proposed to coordinate stress signaling and mitogenic responses (30.Song J. Takeda M. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BAG2 is not the first BAG domain protein that has been implicated in CHIP-dependent protein degradation. BAG1 has been suggested to cooperate with CHIP by facilitating transfer of proteins ubiquitylated by CHIP to the proteasome (8.Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Hohfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This activity of BAG1 is dependent on associations of the proteasome with a ubiquitin-like domain at the amino terminus of BAG1 that is not present in BAG2. We have not detected endogenous complexes containing both CHIP and BAG1 in our studies, which may only indicate that this association is tightly regulated. It is interesting to speculate that serial interactions among BAG proteins regulate the CHIP-Hsp70 ubiquitin ligase. Associations of BAG2 inhibit the ubiquitin ligase and may instead prime the chaperone complex for ATP binding and subsequent rounds of folding. BAG1 binding would in turn relieve BAG2-dependent inhibition of ubiquitylation and would concomitantly facilitate transfer of chaperone substrates ubiquitylated by CHIP to the proteasome for ATP-dependent degradation, although the lower affinity of BAG1 compared with BAG2 that we observed (Fig. 7) would argue that this might occur only under specific circumstances. In any event, our data indicate that BAG domain-containing proteins, and BAG2 specifically, provide a plausible mechanism to regulate the activity of Hsp70-CHIP complexes and therefore to govern the balance between folding and degradation of misfolded proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2130675603,"The use of translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases to bypass DNA lesions during replication constitutes an important mechanism to restart blocked/stalled DNA replication forks. Because TLS polymerases generally have low fidelity on undamaged DNA, the cell must regulate the interaction of TLS polymerases with damaged versus undamaged DNA to maintain genome integrity. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoint proteins Ddc1, Rad17, and Mec3 form a clamp-like structure (the 9-1-1 clamp) that has physical similarity to the homotrimeric sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which interacts with and promotes the processivity of the replicative DNA polymerases. In this work, we demonstrate both an in vivo and in vitro physical interaction between the Mec3 and Ddc1 subunits of the 9-1-1 clamp and the Rev7 subunit of the Polzeta TLS polymerase. In addition, we demonstrate that loss of Mec3, Ddc1, or Rad17 results in a decrease in Polzeta-dependent spontaneous mutagenesis. These results suggest that, in addition to its checkpoint signaling role, the 9-1-1 clamp may physically regulate Polzeta-dependent mutagenesis by controlling the access of Polzeta to damaged DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1991332036,"Methylation and acetylation of position-specific lysine residues in the N-terminal tail of histones H3 and H4 play an important role in regulating chromatin structure and function. In the case of H3-Lys4, H3-Lys9, H3-Lys27, and H4-Lys20, the degree of methyla-tion was variable from the mono- to the di- or trimethylated state, each of which was presumed to be involved in the organization of chromatin and the activation or repression of genes. Here we inves-tigated the interplay between histone H4-Lys20 mono- and trim-ethylation and H4 acetylation at induced (β-major/β-minor glo-bin), repressed (c-myc), and silent (embryonic β-globin) genes during in vitro differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that the β-majorand β-minor promoter and the β-globin coding regions as well as the promoter and the transcribed exon 2 regions of the highly expressed c-myc gene were hyperacetylated and monomethylated at H4-Lys20. Although activation of the β-globin gene resulted in an increase in hyperacetylated, monomethylated H4, down-regulation of the c-myc gene did not cause a decrease in hyperacetylated, monomethylated H4-Lys20, thus showing a stable pattern of histone modifications. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies revealed that monomethylated H4-Lys20 mainly overlaps with RNA pol II-stained euchromatic regions, thus indicating an association with transcriptionally engaged chromatin. Our chromatin immunopre-cipitation results demonstrated that in contrast to trimethylated H4-Lys20, which was found to inversely correlate with H4 hyper-acetylation, H4-Lys20 monomethylation is compatible with histone H4 hyperacetylation and correlates with the transcriptionally active or competent chromatin state.

It has been proposed that distinct post-translational histone modifications act sequentially or in combination to form a “histone code” within chromatin (1.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). Acetylation and methylation of specific histone lysine residues can serve as a mark of either euchromatin or silent heterochromatin. Although methylation of H3-Lys4, H3-Lys36, and H3-Lys79 has been linked to transcriptional activation and protection of euchromatin, H3-Lys9, H3-Lys27, and H4-Lys20 methylation is generally thought to be associated with gene repression and heterochromatin formation (2.Sims R.J.

Moreover, studies that focused on the in vivo distribution of mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3-Lys9 and H3-Lys27 demonstrate that mono- and dimethylated H3-Lys9 and H3-Lys27 are specifically localized to silent domains within euchromatin, whereas trimethylated H3-Lys9 and monomethylated H3-Lys27 were enriched at pericentric heterochromatin (12.Rice J.C.

In contrast to findings suggesting a role for H4-Lys20 methylation in regulating gene expression, a recently published study demonstrates that H4-Lys20 methylation, in particular trimethylation, plays no apparent role in gene regulation or heterochromatin function but is involved in DNA damage response in fission yeast (14.Sanders S.L.

Furthermore, it was shown that trimethylated H3-Lys9 is required for induction of H4-Lys20 trimethylation and that trimethylation of histone H3-Lys9 and H4-Lys20 functions as a repressive mark in gene-silencing mechanisms (5.Schotta G.

Histone H3-Lys27 trimethylation and H4-Lys20 monomethylation were shown to be associated with Xist expression in ES cells and seem to mark the initiation of X inactivation. However, both H3-Lys27 trimethylation and H4-Lys20 monomethylation are maintained in the absence of transcriptional repression (18.Kohlmaier A. Savarese F. Lachner M. Martens J. Jenuwein T. Wutz A.

H4 monomethyl Lys20 was shown to be elevated in proliferating cells; in contrast, histone H4 trimethyl Lys20 became enriched in differentiating cells during the mouse developmental process. Most recently, we investigated the changes in Lys20 methylation states of various acetylated H4 histones as well as the interplay between the various H4-Lys20 methylation states and acetylation during in vitro differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells (16.Sarg B. Helliger W. Talasz H. Koutzamani E. Lindner H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53458-53464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We found that trimethylated H4-Lys20 histones increase during the differentiation process of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and that these hypermethylated H4 histones completely preclude histone H4 tri- and tetraacetylation. With these observations in mind, we decided to investigate the methylation states of H4-Lys20 in correlation with acetylation at induced (β major/minor globin) or repressed (c-myc) genes or at silent genes like embryonic β-globin in the MEL cell system. The β-globin locus, containing the erythroid-specific and developmentally regulated β-globin genes, is a particularly informative system for investigating the structure/function of histone modification patterns. The present study indicates that monomethylated H4-Lys20 is not a principal feature of repressed gene regions. On the contrary, after induction of expression of the adult β-globin gene, we found increased monomethylated H4-Lys20 paralleled by hyperacetylation of H4 at the β-major and β-minor promoter and β-globin transcribed region. Increased levels of monomethyl H4-Lys20 and hyperacetylated H4 at the promoter (exon 1) and the transcribed exon 2 region were also found at the highly expressed c-myc gene. Most interestingly, monomethylation and hyperacetylation of the H4 histone also persist at low expression levels of c-myc, indicating that neither hypoacetylation nor decreased monomethylation of H4 is a prerequisite for c-myc gene down-regulation. To confirm the findings obtained with ChIP, we investigated the H4 acetylation/methylation pattern using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. These experiments revealed that monomethylation of H4-Lys20 excludes neither acetylation of H4-Lys16 nor hyperacetylation of the respective H4 histone molecule. These experiments therefore support our ChIP results showing a negative correlation between the patterns of trimethylated H4-Lys20 and H4 hyperacetylation but a positive correlation between the patterns of monomethylated H4-Lys20 and H4 hyperacetylation at distinct gene regions of the c-myc and β-globin genes. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed that trimethyl H4-Lys20 is enriched mainly within DAPI-dense regions, which almost completely overlap with HP1β-stained heterochromatin largely excluded, however, from active chromatin (RNApol II) regions. In contrast, monomethyl H4-Lys20 mainly overlaps with RNApol II-stained euchromatic regions and is largely excluded from HP1β-stained heterochromatin, indicating an association with transcriptionally engaged chromatin. To summarize our results, we conclude that hyperacetylated and monomethylated H4-Lys20 may be important in maintaining the transcriptionally active or competent chromatin state. Cell Culture—MEL cells (line F4N) were grown in Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium containing 2× nonessential amino acids, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were cultured at initial cell density of 5 × 104/ml at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Differentiation was induced by the addition of 2% Me2SO for 96 h or 1.75 mm sodium butyrate for 72 h. The percentage of benzidine-positive cells was determined as described by Orkin et al. (21.Orkin S.H. Harosi F.J. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Expression analysis by RT-PCR was performed with the Titanium One-step RT-PCR kit (Clontech) by using the following primer pairs: GAPDH fwd 5′-ACGGGAAGCCCATCACCATCTTCCA-3′ and rev 5′-ATCCACGACGGACACATTGGGGGTA-3′; myc fwd 5′-GGCTGGATTTCCTTTGGGCGTTGGA-3′ and rev 5′-TCTTTGCGCGCAGCCTGGTAGGA-3′; and β-globin fwd 5′-GGTTGTCTACCCTTGGACCCAGC-3′ and rev 5′-GGTACTTGTGAGCCAGGGCAGT-3′. The RT-PCR analysis of the two adult β-globin genes (β-minor and β-major) was performed with a primer pair that coamplifies β-minor and β-major globin cDNAs. To distinguish the two β-globin products, restriction enzyme digestion with PvuI was performed, which generates two β-minor globin products (234 and 107 bp) and one undigested β-major globin product (341 bp). PCR samples were separated on a 2% agarose gel, standardized by using control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) signal, and quantified. Formaldehyde Cross-linking and Sonication—1 × 108 cells were fixed with 0.4% formaldehyde in minimum Eagle's medium for 10 min at room temperature with gentle agitation to generate protein-DNA cross-links. To quench the reaction, glycine (125 mm final) was added. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and then washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline. After nuclei were prepared in cell lysis buffer at 4 °C (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) as indicated in the product description), nuclei were lysed by incubation in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, and complete protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min on ice. The lysate was sonicated at 4 °C with 10 pulses of 30 s each at 40% of maximum power with a Bandelin electronic UW 2070 (70 watts) sonicator with a 2-mm tip to generate DNA fragments from ∼200 to 1000 bp with a maximum at ∼500 bp. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was used as soluble chromatin for chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIPs were performed as described by Forsberg et al. (22.Forsberg E.C. Downs K.M. Christensen H.M. Im H. Nuzzi P.A. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14494-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the supernatant of soluble chromatin corresponding to ∼4 × 106 cells (∼3 A260 units of DNA) were used for chromatin immunoprecipitations. One volume of soluble chromatin was diluted with 9 volumes of ChIP dilution buffer (17 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, and complete protease inhibitor mixture) and precleared with 100 μl of protein A-agarose (50% slurry in ChIP dilution buffer) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After centrifugation at 400 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, an aliquot (∼150 μl) of precleared chromatin was removed and used in the subsequent PCR as input. The remainder of the chromatin (∼800 μl) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotating with 10 μg of the respective antibody or with an isotype-matched unspecific antibody as a negative control. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein A-agarose (50% slurry in ChIP dilution buffer) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotating. Protein A-agarose pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of low salt immune complex (IC) wash buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100), once with high salt IC wash buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100), once with LiCl wash buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate), and twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Immune complexes were eluted twice as the bound fraction with 250 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS). NaCl (0.2 m final) was added to the bound fraction, and the input chromatin and cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. Incubation with RNase A (0.05 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min was followed by digestion with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) at 45 °C for 2 h. DNA was purified by two extractions with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Purified DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of water and quantified using picogreen fluorescence (Molecular Probes). PCR—The following primers were used for PCR: HS6 (product size 245 bp) fwd 5′-TCTTTAGTAAGGCATCCCACACA-3′, rev 5′-AGAGACCGAAGAAAAGGAGAATG-3′; HS3 (product size 254) fwd 5′-CTGATGAGGATTCAATGGGTTAG-3′, rev 5′-TCATCTATCTGAGCCAGCATGTA-3′; HS2 (product size 295 bp) fwd 5′-TCCTACACATTAACGAGCCTCTG-3′, rev 5′-TGATCACTCACAGCTGAAAACAT-3′; HS1 (product size 260 bp) fwd 5′-CATCCCTGGACAGATAAACAAGA-3′, rev 5′-CAAAATTCATAACACGGAAAAGC-3′; Ey-globin promoter (product size 245 bp) fwd 5′-AGAGAGTTTTTGTTGAAGGAGGA-3′, rev 5′-CACAGGAGTGTCAGAAGCAAGTA-3′; β-H1-globin promoter (product size 246 bp) fwd 5′-AGGTCCAGGGTGAAGAATAAAAG-3′, rev 5′-ATAGAAACCCTGGAAATTTCTGC-3′; β-major globin promoter (product size 179 bp) fwd 5′-GTACCCAGAGCTGAGACTCCTAA-3′, rev 5′-AGCAACTGATCCTACCTCACCTT-3′; β-minor globin promoter (product size 255 bp) fwd 5′-AGAATTAGCTGCGAGGATAAGA-3′, rev 5′-GCAAGTCAACACAACAGACTCA-3′; β-globin transcribed region 1 (product size 179 bp) fwd 5′-CCCAGCGGTACTTTGATAGC-3′, rev 5′-ATGCAGCTTGTCACAGTGGA-3′; β-globin transcribed region 2 (product size 246 bp) fwd 5′-CCCAGCGGTACTTTGATAGC-3′, rev 5′-AGAATAGCCAGGGGAAGGAA-3′; myc exon 1 (product size 264 bp) fwd 5′-GGGGAAGGGAGAAAGAGAGATT-3′, rev 5′-CTGGAATTACTACAGCGAGTCAGA-3′; and myc exon 2 transcribed region (product size 239 bp) fwd 5′-TTTCTATCACCAGCAACAGCAG-3′, rev 5′-CTCCTCCAAGTAACTCGGTCAT-3′. PCRs were performed in 1× buffer (16 mm (NH4)2SO4, 67 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20), 0.25 mm dNTPs, 2% Me2SO, 2 units of Bio Therm Taq-DNA polymerase, 0.25 μm of each primer set, 5 ng (10 ng) of DNA from bound fraction, control, or input. We used a touchdown PCR protocol starting at 95 °C for 3 min (10 min in the case of hot start DNA polymerase), followed by 5 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; then 5 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and finally 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were collected after 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 cycles and separated on 2% agarose gels. Gels were scanned using the Typhoon gel and blot imager (Amersham Biosciences), and trace or volume intensity was measured using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Curves from input and bound were generated for each primer pair, and the enrichment or depletion of the bound fraction as compared with the input was calculated using the linear range of the two curves. Antibodies—The antibodies used were as follows: rabbit polyclonal to tetraacetylated H4 (amino acids 2-19) (Upstate 06-866), Western blotting 1:2500, ChIP 15 μl/4 × 106 cells; rabbit polyclonal to tetraacetylated H4 (amino acids 2-19) (Upstate 06-598), immunofluorescence 1:200; rabbit polyclonal to H4-acetyl-Lys16 (Abcam Ab1762), Western blotting 1:1000, ChIP 15 μl/4 × 106 cells; rabbit polyclonal to H4-mono-me-Lys20 (Abcam Ab9051), Western blotting 1:1000, immunofluorescence 1:200, ChIP 10 μg/4 × 106 cells; rabbit polyclonal to H4-di-me-Lys20 (Upstate 07-367), Western blotting 1:5000; rabbit polyclonal to H4-tri-me-Lys20 (Abcam Ab9053), Western blotting 1:1000, immunofluorescence 1:200, ChIP 10 μg/4 × 106 cells; rat monoclonal to HP1β (Abcam Ab10811), immunofluorescence 1:50; mouse monoclonal to RNA polymerase II (Abcam Ab5408), immunofluorescence 1:50. AffiniPure rabbit anti-rat IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch 312-005-003) was used as an isotype-matched antibody for the ChIP control studies. For Western blotting, goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma A0545) 1:5000 was used as secondary antibody. The secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were as follows: goat anti-rabbit IgG FITC conjugate (Sigma F9887) 1:160; goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) AffiniPure Fab fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch 111-167-003) 1:100; goat anti-rat IgG Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch 112-165-062) 1:160; and goat anti-mouse IgG Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch 115-165-062) 1:160. Western Blotting—Histones were resolved in SDS-loading buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was probed with antibodies using standard techniques and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Mouse erythroleukemia cells were grown in suspension culture, collected by centrifugation, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. An amount of 105 cells was cytospun onto slides. Cells were permeabilized using Triton X-100 (1% for 2 min and 0.1% for 10 min) in KCM buffer (120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5), blocked for 30 min with 2.5% bovine serum albumin/KCM, and sequentially incubated with the primary and secondary antibodies (in 1% bovine serum albumin/KCM). Cells were fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in KCM, stained with DAPI for 1 min, and mounted in ProLong antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). For double labeling with rabbit polyclonal to tetraacetylated H4 as first primary antibody and either rabbit polyclonal to H4-mono-me-Lys20 or rabbit polyclonal to H4-tri-me-Lys20 as second primary antibody, we used Cy3-conjugated Fab fragment goat anti-rabbit IgG as first secondary antibody to achieve effective blocking of the first primary antibody (tetraacetylated H4). Staining was visualized using a ×100 objective on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Images were captured using MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp.), processed by deconvolution analysis using AutoDeblur Deconvolution software (AutoQuant Imaging, Inc.), and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop 8.0. Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography—The histone fraction H4 (∼120 μg) was isolated by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography as described (23.Sarg B. Koutzamani E. Helliger W. Rundquist I. Lindner H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39195-39201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and further separated on a SynChropak CM300 column (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter; 6.5-μm particle size; 30-nm pore size; Agilent Technologies, Vienna, Austria) at 30 °C and at a constant flow of 1.0 ml/min using a multistep gradient starting at solvent A/solvent B (100:0) (solvent A: 70% acetonitrile, 0.015 m triethanolamine/H3PO4, pH 3.0; solvent B: 65% acetonitrile, 0.015 m triethanolamine/H3PO4, pH 3.0, and 0.68 m NaClO4). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 0 to 10% B in 2 min and from 10 to 40% in 30 min and was then maintained at 40% for 10 min. The modified histone H4 isoforms obtained by HILIC were identified by ESI-MS as described (23.Sarg B. Koutzamani E. Helliger W. Rundquist I. Lindner H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39195-39201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Distribution of Monomethyl H4-Lys20 and Trimethyl H4-Lys20 during Interphase and at Metaphase in MEL Cells—To localize modified histones, we used immunofluorescence with monospecific antibodies. The distribution of mono- and trimethylated H4-Lys20 during MEL cell interphase was investigated by dual immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1). We found that trimethylated H4-Lys20 is enriched mainly in DAPI-dense regions with almost complete overlapping with HP1β-stained heterochromatin (Fig. 1A), which is largely excluded from active chromatin (RNApol II) (Fig. 1B) regions. In contrast, monomethylated H4-Lys20 mainly overlaps with RNApol II-stained euchromatic regions (Fig. 1D) and not with DAPI-dense regions (Fig. 1C), thus indicating an association with transcriptionally engaged chromatin. A comparable distribution pattern of both monomethylated (data not shown) and trimethylated H4-Lys20 was also seen in differentiated MEL cells (16.Sarg B. Helliger W. Talasz H. Koutzamani E. Lindner H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53458-53464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mono- and Trimethyl H4-Lys20 Histones Are Enriched after Induction of MEL Cell Differentiation—We next asked whether the levels of modified histones change during the MEL cell differentiation process using Me2SO. Histones from induced and uninduced MEL cells were prepared and run on SDS-PAGE. After blotting to nitrocellulose, specific antibodies to mono-, di-, and trimethylated H4-Lys20, acetylated H4-Lys16, and hyperacetylated H4 were used for immunological Western blot analysis. Although the level of dimethylated H4-Lys20 did not change after treatment with Me2SO, the monomethylated H4-Lys20 level increased about 1.5-fold and that of trimethylated H4-Lys20 about 2-fold (Fig. 2). The level of acetylated H4-Lys16 and the level of hyperacetylated histone H4 were clearly diminished in Me2SO-treated MEL cells as compared with untreated controls (Fig. 2). These results prompted us to analyze the relationship between the distribution of various epigenetic marks and gene activation or repression during MEL cell differentiation. Because it is well known that during MEL cell differentiation the adult β-globin gene is largely expressed (24.Sawado T. Igarashi K. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10226-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and the c-myc gene is rapidly down-regulated (25.Lachman H.M. Skoultchi A.I. Nature. 1984; 310: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 26.Kume T.S. Takada S. Obinata M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27.Kohlhuber F. Strobl L.J. Eick D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1099-1102PubMed Google Scholar), we used these gene loci to investigate histone H4 acetylation and methylation status at distinct sites. As determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 3), the increase in β-major globin transcript is about 60-fold and that in β-minor about 3-fold after 96 h of induction (Fig. 3, A and B). The myc transcripts decreased by about 10-15-fold after 96 h of induction, which is consistent with earlier reports (25.Lachman H.M. Skoultchi A.I.

Mid-infrared data from the Cooled Mid-Infrared Camera and Spectrometer (COMICS) of the Subaru Telescope indicate that the large-scale dust plume ejected by the impact contained a large mass (â¼10 6 kilograms) of dust and formed two wings approximately Â±45Â° from the symmetric center, both consistent with gravity as the primary control on the impact and its immediate aftermath. The dust distribution in the inner part of the plume, however, is inconsistent with a pure gravity control and implies that evaporation and expansion of volatiles accelerated dust."
https://openalex.org/W2006360199,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) have been implicated in a wide variety of physiological functions. We have used a rat dorsal root ganglion cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify sensory neuron proteins that interact with ASICs. We found that annexin II light chain p11 physically interacts with the N terminus of ASIC1a, but not other ASIC isoforms. Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed an interaction between p11 and ASIC1 in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in vivo. Coexpression of p11 and ASIC1a in CHO-K1 cells led to a 2-fold increase in expression of the ion channel at the cell membrane as determined by membrane-associated immunoreactivity and cell-surface biotinylation. Consistent with these findings, peak ASIC1a currents in transfected CHO-K1 cells were up-regulated 2-fold in the presence of p11, whereas ASIC3-mediated currents were unaffected by p11 expression. Neither the pH dependence of activation nor the rates of desensitization were altered by p11, suggesting that its primary role in regulating ASIC1a activity is to enhance cell-surface expression of ASIC1a. These data demonstrate that p11, already known to traffic members of the voltage-gated sodium and potassium channel families as well as transient receptor potential and chloride channels, also plays a selective role in enhancing ASIC1a functional expression."

Because C/EBPα-/- mice die shortly after birth (8.Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J.

These models have primarily focused on the ablation of C/EBPα in a limited number of tissues (28.Lee Y.H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Inoue Y. Inoue J. Lambert G. Yim S.H. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol.

It is, thus, not known whether the total ablation of C/EBPα during postnatal life is lethal to animals or destructive to metabolic processes. To investigate the consequence of a total deletion of c/ebpα in adult mice, we have created a mouse model in which the gene for C/EBPα was virtually totally deleted in the liver, white and brown adipose tissues, spleen, pancreas, kidney, and lung by a single injection of poly(I:C). The metabolic implications of ablating this transcription factor in animals after birth are presented. Creation of Mice (Genotype = Mx1-Cre+ + C/EBPαF/-)—Mx1-Cre mice were kindly provided by Klaus Rajewsky (31.Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). The creation of C/EBPα+/- and C/EBPαF/F mice has been described in detail previously (8.Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A.

Immunity. 2004; 21: 853-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Mice (genotype = Mx1-Cre+ + C/EBPαF/-) were created through breeding followed by selecting for the animal with the desired combination of transgenes. The genetic background of this new line is a mixture of C57BL6, SVE129, and CBA strains. Genotyping Mice Using PCR—Transgenic mice were routinely genotyped by using a single PCR reaction to simultaneously identify three transgenes, the C/EBPαF allele, the C/EBPα- allele, and the Mx1-Cre. The primers, αNeo-1 (5′-CCACCCCTTCCCAGCCTC-3′) and αNeo-2 (5′-GAGGAAGCTAAGACCCACTAC-3′), were designed to amplify a region of 710 bp in the C/EBPα- allele (see Fig. 1A). The primers LoxP-2 (5′-CGCAGAGATTGTGCGTCTTT-3′) and LoxP-3 (5-ATACATTATACGAAGTTATGGCCGCC-3′) were used to amplify a region of 173 bp in the C/EBPαF allele (see Fig. 1A). The primers Cre-1 (5′-ATGTTCAATTTACTGACCG-3′) and Cre-2 (5′-CGCCGCATAACCAGTGAAAC-3′) were used to amplify a 355-bp region in the coding sequence in the Mx1-Cre transgene. The PCR reaction was carried out in a 25 μl solution containing ∼250 ng of genomic DNA (1 μl) isolated from the tail of a mouse, 2.5 μl of 10× reaction buffer (PCRx Enhancer System, Invitrogen), 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP mixture (2.5 mm each), 2 μl of 25 mm MgSO4, 0.8 μl of primer mixture of αNeo (2.5 μm αNeo-1 and 5 μm αNeo-2), 4 μl of primer mixture of C/EBPαF allele (5 μm LoxP-2 and 5 μm LoxP-3), 0.8 μl of primer mixture of Mx1-Cre transgene (5 μm Cre-1 and 5 μm Cre-2), and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). After denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, the cycling reaction was performed as follows: 57 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 50 s, 94 °C for 14 s, with a total of 35 cycles. The PCR products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Three specific DNA products, corresponding to three transgenes (a 710-bp band for the C/EBPα- allele, a 173-bp band for the C/EBPαF allele, and a 355-bp band for the Mx1-Cre transgene) were detected (see Fig. 1B). Administration of Poly(I:C)—Poly(I:C) (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl to a concentration of 1 mg/ml and administered to animals (10 mg/kg of body weight) at 1 day or 3 months of age. For 1-day-old neonates, the poly(I:C) solution was injected subcutaneously into their back; for older animals, it was injected intraperitoneally. Unless otherwise indicated, the animals received only a single injection of poly(I:C). Southern Blotting—Southern blotting was done as described by Croniger et al. (32.Croniger C.M. Millward C. Yang J. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Liu S. Harada-Shiba M. Chakravarty K. Friedman J.E. Poli V. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA from various tissues was digested with the restriction enzyme EcoRI. The NotI fragment (528 bp) (see Fig. 1A, hatched bar), that was used as probe hybridizes with the alleles of C/EBPαF, C/EBPα+, and C/EBPαΔ to produce 9.2-, 9.2-, and 4.9-kb bands, respectively (see Figs. 1A and 2A). The probe does not hybridize with the C/EBPα- allele because the target sequence was deleted. The Southern blotting was scanned by using Typhoon 9200 (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of each band was corrected by subtracting the background. The excision efficiency was calculated by using the following equation: excision efficiency = band intensity of C/EBPαΔ allele/(band intensity of C/EBPαF allele + band intensity of C/EBPαΔ allele). The percentage of C/EBPα DNA remaining in the cells was calculated by using the following equation; for C/EBPαF/- mice, the percentage of C/EBPα DNA remaining = 50% - (50% × the excision efficiency). A 50% value represents one copy of c/ebpα in the C/EBPαF/- mice. For C/EBPαF/F mice, the percentage of C/EBPα DNA remaining = 100% - (100% × the excision efficiency). Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated from the liver of mice with an RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen Inc.). Northern blotting was conducted as previously described (32.Croniger C.M. Millward C. Yang J. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Liu S. Harada-Shiba M. Chakravarty K. Friedman J.E. Poli V. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The cDNA probes were as follows: for PEPCK-C (39∼2168 bases of mRNA, GenBank™ NM_011044); for glucose-6-phosphatase (76∼1153 bases of mRNA, GenBank™ NM_000151); for glycogen synthase (1∼1483 bases of mRNA, Gen-Bank™ NM_013089); for glucokinase (5∼2191 bases of mRNA, GenBank™ NM_012565); for C/EBPα (375∼953 bases of mRNA, Gen-Bank™ NM_007678); for C/EBPβ (487∼1336 bases of mRNA, Gen-Bank™ NM_024125); for C/EBPδ (52∼900 bases of mRNA, Gen-Bank™ NM_007679); for PPARα (979∼1831 bases of mRNA, GenBank™ NM_011144); for apolipoprotein C3 (17∼516 bases of mRNA, GenBank™ NM_023114); for SREBP-1 (151∼1407 bases of mRNA, GenBank™ NM_011480). Western Blotting—Livers were isolated and fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions as described by Dignam et al. (33.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and used for Western blotting as previously described (34.Yang J. Kawai Y. Hanson R.W. Arinze I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25742-25752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (15 μg of protein) were separated by electrophoresis in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. C/EBPα was detected by using rabbit anti-C/EBPα IgG as the primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-61; 1:1000 dilution) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP as the secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-2004; 1:3000 dilution). Measurements of Body Weight and Food and Water Consumption—Animals were transferred to metabolic cages 2 weeks before the administration of poly(I:C) so as to become acclimatized to a new living environment. Adult animals were then given a single injection of poly(I:C) (10 mg/kg of body weight) at 3 months of age. Their initial body weight, measured before the injection, was designated as the starting body weight, and their body weight and food and water consumptions were recorded every other day. Changes in body weight were calculated as the average daily body weight minus the starting body weight of the animal. Unless indicated, all animals were given free access to water and standard chow (Prolab® 5P75 Isopro® 3000 containing 22% protein, 5% fat, and 5% crude fiber and the remainder carbohydrate). Some control mice (genotype = Mx1-Cre- and C/EBPαF/F) were pairfed, starting on day 18 after the injection of poly(I:C). They had free access to water, but their daily food consumption was rationed by using the equation y = z - w × 0.115655 + w × 16.36/e(0.2765 × x), where y is the daily food supply (g), w is the starting body weight, z is the food intake on day 18 after the injection of poly(I:C), and x is the number of days after the injection. DNA Microarray Analysis—One-day-old neonates were given a single injection of poly(I:C) (10 mg/kg of body weight), and their livers were removed 28 days later. Total RNA, isolated from the liver, was analyzed by using murine MoE430A GeneChip® array (Affymetrix) at the DNA Microarray Core Facility at Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine. Four animals, evenly divided into two groups, were analyzed simultaneously. Animals in each group were siblings of the same gender, with one C/EBPαΔ/- mouse and one normal-fed control animal (genotype = Mx1-Cre- + C/EBPαF/F). The data were grouped and analyzed with GeneSpring software program (Silicon Genetics). The probe sequences on the MoE430A array were confirmed by comparing them to the mouse genomic sequence data base at the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/MmBlast.html). Only probes with sequences located in the coding sequence and/or the untranslated region of the intended genes were included in our analysis. The reliability of the final data was further confirmed by verifying their reproducibility in both groups and by performing Northern analysis. The data are presented as -fold change in mRNA concentration in C/EBPαΔ/- mice compared with normal-fed controls (genotype = Mx1-Cre- + C/EBPαF/F). Histological Analysis of Tissues—Fresh tissue was collected from mice and placed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution (Sigma). Hematoxylin-and-eosin staining was performed at the Histology Core Facility at Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine, and Oil red O staining was done at the Veterinary Diagnostic Services of Marshfield Laboratories (Marshfield, WI). Assay of Metabolites in the Blood—Mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol; 0.5 ml of 20 mg/ml solution per 25 g of body weight). The concentration of glucose in the blood was determined by using Encore® Glucometer. Plasma was generated from whole blood using MICROTAINER® plasma separator tubes (BD Biosciences). The plasma concentrations of insulin, leptin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (active) were measured with a mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Linco Research, Inc.), a mouse leptin TiterZyme® enzyme immunometric assay (EIA) kit (Assay Designs, Inc.), and glucagons-like peptide-1 (active) ELISA kit (Linco Research, Inc.). The measurement of triglyceride, fractionated bilirubin, albumin, β-hydroxybutyrate, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, cholesterol, and free fatty acid was performed at the Veterinary Diagnostic Services of Marshfield Laboratories (Marshfield, WI). Determination of Hepatic Glycogen—Glycogen was determined according to Suzuki et al. (35.Suzuki Y. Lanner C. Kim J.H. Vilardo P.G. Zhang H. Yang J. Cooper L.D. Steele M. Kennedy A. Bock C.B. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2683-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with modifications. Pieces of liver (∼50 mg) were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 30% KOH. Glycogen was then precipitated with 0.5 ml of 100% ethanol and 10 μl of 4 m LiCl by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 30 min. To degrade the glycogen (in the pellet) to glucose, 0.5 ml of 4 m HCl was added to lyse the pellet, and the glucose-containing lysate was neutralized with 0.5 ml of 2 m K2CO3 solution. The concentration of glucose was determined using a YSI glucose analyzer (Giangarlo Scientific Co.). Hormone and Other Treatments—Hormones were administrated to animals according to Lechner et al. (36.Lechner P.S. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Millward C. Fekter C. Yun J.S. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22675-22679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, streptozotocin (freshly prepared, 200 mg/kg of body weight) was administrated to mice at day 11 after the injection of poly(I:C). Mice were fasted 18 h before injection and fed 2 h later. The concentration of blood glucose was measured daily using blood collected from the tail vein. Animals with a blood glucose concentration higher than 250 mg/dl were considered diabetic. Bt2cAMP was administered to the mice at day 28 after the injection of poly(I:C). To minimize differences caused by different feeding behavior of the animals, mice were injected with glucose (2 mg/gram of body weight) 2 h before the intraperitoneal administration of a mixture of Bt2cAMP (35 mg/kg of body weight) and theophylline (30 mg/kg of body weight). The mice were killed 1 h after the last injection. In the control group, saline was used instead of the mixture of Bt2cAMP and theophylline. Creation and Characterization of Mice with a Genotype of Mx1-Cre+ + C/EBPαF/-—To delete c/ebpα in adult mice, we developed a mouse model that was heterozygous for c/ebpα. One allele of c/ebpα is flanked by a loxP site (designated as C/EBPαF) (19.Zhang P. Iwasaki-Arai J. Iwasaki H. Fenyus M.L. Dayaram T. Owens B.M. Shigematsu H. Levantini E. Huettner C.S. Lekstrom-Himes J.A. Akashi K. Tenen D.G. Immunity. 2004; 21: 853-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and the other is a knock-out allele (C/EBPα-) (8.Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The genome of the mice also included a chimeric transgene Mx1-Cre (31.Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar), composed of the gene for Cre recombinase, linked to the Mx1 gene promoter that can be transiently activated by the administration of interferon α, interferon β, or an interferon inducer, such as poly(I:C). Use of mice with a heterozygous composition of c/ebpα (C/EBPαF/-) complicates genotyping procedures because two additional alleles (C/EBPαF and C/EBPα-) have to be genotyped compared with homozygous (C/EBPαF/F) mice. We, therefore, developed a PCR-based protocol that allowed us to genotype the three transgenes simultaneously in a single PCR reaction. This involved the construction of three sets of primers that amplified unique regions of the C/EBPα-, Mx1-Cre+, and C/EBPαF transgenes (Fig. 1A). The sizes of PCR products generated with these primers were 710 bp for C/EBPα-, 355 bp for Mx1-Cre+, and 173 bp for C/EBPαF (Fig. 1B). Mice with a genotype of Mx1-Cre+ + C/EBPαF/- developed normally and were indistinguishable from mice with a genotype of C/EBPα+/+ (wild type), C/EBPαF/+, or C/EBPαF/F. An advantage of using mice with such a heterozygous genotype is that they only have 50% of c/ebpα (one allele, C/EBPαF) to be excised by Cre recombinase as compared with mice with two alleles of the gene (C/EBPαF/F). Efficiency and Specificity of the Excision of C/EBPαF in Various Tissues—To assess the excision efficiency of C/EBPαF allele, a DNA fragment obtained after NotI digestion of the 5′-region of genomic DNA for C/EBPα (Fig. 1A) was used as a probe for Southern blotting. This probe hybridizes to the alleles of C/EBPα+, C/EBPαF, and C/EBPαΔ, but not to C/EBPα-, which lacks the probe sequence (Fig. 1A). Two fragments were detected by Southern blotting; they are a 9.2-kb fragment for the C/EBPα+ or C/EBPαF alleles and a 4.9-kb fragment for the C/EBPαΔ allele (the excised product). After the poly(I:C) treatment, c/ebpα was totally deleted in the liver of mice that carried one copy of C/EBPαF (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-3) or two copies of C/EBPαF (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 4). The specificity of deletion is shown in the last four lanes of Fig. 2A. As expected, only 50% of c/ebpα was excised when one allele was C/EBPαF and the other was C/EBPα+ (Fig. 2A, top panel, lane 8). Quantification of the Southern blots indicated 97% deletion of c/ebpα in the liver of C/EBPαF/- mice and 91% deletion in C/EBPαF/F mice compared with control mice (genotype = Mx1-Cre- + C/EBPαF/F) (Fig. 2B, Liv.). There was also almost total deletion of c/ebpα in other tissues of C/EBPαF/- mice: spleen (∼90%), white adipose tissue (WAT) (∼89%), pancreas (∼83%), lung (∼80%), kidney (∼80%), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) (∼80%) (Fig. 2B, filled bars). This is a marked improvement over the inefficient deletion of the gene noted in C/EBPαF/F mice (Fig. 2B, hatched bars). We have, thus, created a model in which the gene for C/EBPα has been ablated in C/EBPα-abundant tissues of adult mice. Kinetics for the Excision of C/EBPαF in Liver—To evaluate the rapidity of the excision of c/ebpα, the levels of DNA, mRNA, and protein for hepatic C/EBPα were measured at days 1-4 after injection of poly(I:C). Approximately 95% of c/ebpα was excised from the liver within 24 h after the injection (Fig. 3A); the excision was complete by the 2nd day. Virtually no C/EBPα mRNA was detected in the liver 1 day after injection of poly(I:C) (Fig. 3B). C/EBPα protein also rapidly disappeared from the nucleus. In fact, only two isoforms, i.e. A and B1 (also known as p42) (37.Calkhoven C.F. Muller C. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1920-1932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were visible at days 1 and 2 after injection of poly(I:C) (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4). By day 4, C/EBPα protein was completely ablated in the liver of C/EBPαΔ/- mice (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 5 and 6 to lanes 1, 2, and 7). By comparing the intensity of B1 isoform at different time points, we estimated that the half-life of C/EBPα protein is less than 12 h in the liver of animals. Postnatal Development and Hypophagia of C/EBPαΔ/- Mice—To investigate the role of C/EBPα during postnatal development, we ablated C/EBPα in mice at either 1 day after birth (neonate) or at 3 months of age (adult). When poly(I:C) was administrated to neonates, the resultant C/EBPαΔ/-mice showed no noticeable change in phenotype during the first 15 days (Phase I), after which the animals displayed marked growth retardation and died about 4 weeks after the injection of poly(I:C); their body weights were about one-third those of control mice (Fig. 4A). In an attempt to nutritionally “rescue” the animals, their regular diet was supple"
https://openalex.org/W2156322925,"Immediately prior to invasion Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites release a large number of micronemal proteins (TgMICs) that participate in host cell attachment and penetration. The TgMIC4-MIC1-MIC6 complex was the first to be identified in T. gondii and has been recently shown to be critical in invasion. This study establishes that the N-terminal thrombospondin type I repeat-like domains (TSR1-like) from TgMIC1 function as an independent adhesin as well as promoting association with TgMIC4. Using the newly solved three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal domain of TgMIC1 we have identified a novel Galectin-like fold that does not possess carbohydrate binding properties and redefines the architecture of TgMIC1. Instead, the TgMIC1 Galectin-like domain interacts and stabilizes TgMIC6, which provides the basis for a highly specific quality control mechanism for successful exit from the early secretory compartments and for subsequent trafficking of the complex to the micronemes."

Sexual reproduction is of biological importance in Phytophthora and has been believed to be stimulated by unknown endogenous factors named a hormones. We describe here the chemical characterization of a Phytophthora mating hormone, a1, which was obtained from approximately 2 tons of culture fluid of one mating type of a species and which induced sexual spores on the counter-mating type at a nanogram level."
https://openalex.org/W2162959052,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) has been shown to link leptin receptor activation to stimulation of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels and subsequent inhibition of hippocampal epileptiform-like activity. However, the downstream targets of PI3-kinase in this action of leptin are unknown. Here we show that BK channel activation by leptin is dependent on the actin cytoskeleton, as it is prevented by actin filament stabilization and mimicked by actin disruption. Fluorescent labeling of polymerized actin filaments revealed that leptin promotes the rapid rearrangement of actin filaments via activation of PI 3-kinase; an action paralleled by discrete increases in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 immunoreactivity in close proximity to BK channels. After leptin exposure, there was also an actin-dependent increase in the association of BK channel immunoreactivity with synaptic markers. These data are consistent with the notion that leptin activates BK channels via PI 3-kinase-dependent reorganization of actin filaments and subsequent clustering of BK channels at synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2016539997,"The transcription factor PDX-1 plays a crucial role during pancreatic development and in the function of insulin-producing beta cells. Disruption of the pdx-1 gene in these cells induces overt diabetes in mice, and this gene is modified in several type 2 diabetic families. It is thus crucial to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of PDX-1 expression and/or activation. We identified new proteins associated with PDX-1 by mass spectrometry. These proteins, Ku70 and Ku80, are regulatory subunits of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). We determined that the interaction between PDX-1 and Ku70 or Ku80 is dependent on the homeodomain of PDX-1. Most interestingly, we demonstrated in vitro that the DNA-PK phosphorylates PDX-1 on threonine 11. Although this residue is located in the transactivation domain, this phosphorylation does not seem to be implicated in the transcriptional activation of PDX-1. However, in response to radiation, which activates DNA-PK, a second form of the PDX-1 protein appears rapidly. This form is phosphorylated on threonine and seems to drive PDX-1 degradation by the proteosome. In correlation with this degradation, we observed a subsequent reduction in the activation of the insulin promoter and a decrease in PDX-1-mediated gene expression, i.e. glut2 and glucokinase.

Although initially produced in both exocrine and endocrine compartments of the developing pancreas, PDX-1 expression shifts to beta cells in the fully formed pancreas (5.Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Teitelman G. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it functions in glucose homeostasis. Targeted disruption of the pdx-1 gene leads to pancreatic agenesis in Pdx-1–/– homozygotes (6.Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Pdx-1+/– mice develop normally and have wild type islet cell mass by morphometric analysis, but they display abnormal serum glucose levels after intraperitoneal glucose injection (7.Dutta S. Bonner-Weir S. Montminy M. Wright C. Nature. 1998; 392: 560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Indeed, disruption of the pdx-1 gene in insulin-producing beta cells induces overt diabetes in these animals, with reduced expression of insulin and glucose transporter genes (8.Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonsson L. Simu K. Edlund H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the pdx-1 gene is modified in several type 2 diabetic families, leading to the establishment of MODY 4 (maturity onset diabetes of the young 4) (9.Clocquet A.R. Egan J.M. Stoffers D.A. Muller D.C. Wideman L. Chin G.A. Clarke W.L. Hanks J.B. Habener J.F. Elahi D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1856-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10.Stoffers D.A.

Thus, PDX-1 is a key player in the development of the pancreas and in the maintenance of the function of pancreatic beta cells. Although the role of PDX-1 in beta cells is now well established, the mechanisms triggering its activation remain to be clarified. Several studies have suggested that its activation involves post-translational modifications of PDX-1. Taken together, the reported data suggest that serine/threonine phosphorylation could play a major role in the nuclear translocation and function of PDX-1 (11.Khoo S. Griffen S.C. Xia Y. Baer R.J.

However, it is not clear how those phosphorylations regulate PDX-1 in vivo, which kinases are implicated in the phosphorylation process, and which stimuli promote PDX-1 phosphorylation.

A member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related family, DNA-PK is a Ser/Thr kinase composed of two Ku regulatory subunits (Ku70/Ku80) and a large catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) (15.Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). This kinase is implicated in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), which is the major repair process in cells (16.Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, DNA-PK is recruited to DNA ends, activated, and joined to the DNA repair complex. DNA-PK-deficient mice are immunodeficient, radiosensitive, and more susceptible to tumor development (17.Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da Costa Soares V. Sanchez M. Sokol K. Nussenzweig M.C. Li G.C.

DNA-damaging stimuli result in profound changes in gene expression causing the inhibition of proliferation and differentiation of cells (that allow DNA repair) thus preventing transmission of chromosomal aberrations. Several investigators suggest that aside from its role in DNA repair, DNA-PK may also be implicated in cell survival (20.Henkels K.M. Turchi J.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3077-3083PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Song J.Y. Lim J.W. Kim H. Morio T. Kim K.H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and may regulate the activity and/or the stability of transcription factors. Among these transcription factors, interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) is phosphorylated on threonine by DNA-PK in response to viral infection (23.Karpova A.Y. Trost M. Murray J.M. Cantley L.C. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2818-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This leads to the retention of IRF-3 in the nucleus, thereby protecting it from proteosomal degradation. More recently, it has been demonstrated that DNA-PK may down-regulate histone H2B expression in response to DNA damage by regulating the stability and activity of the homeobox transcription factor Oct-1 (octamer transcription factor-1) (24.Schild-Poulter C. Shih A. Yarymowich N.C. Hache R.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7197-7205PubMed Google Scholar). To define new molecular mechanisms that could be implicated in PDX-1 regulation, we have performed an analysis of proteins associated with PDX-1 by mass spectrometry. We demonstrate here that PDX-1 interacts with the two regulatory subunits of the DNA-PK, Ku70 and Ku80. These results corroborate those published previously showing an interaction of the homeodomain proteins Oct-1 and Hox4 with the Ku proteins (14.Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. Giffin W. Kochan J.C. Ngsee J.K. Traykova-Andonova M. Haché R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16848-16856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our present data also show that the DNA-PK is able to phosphorylate PDX-1 on threonine 11. Threonine phosphorylation on PDX-1 has also been detected in response to UV light and γ-radiation, which are known to activate DNA-PK. Finally, we show in this report that radiation is able to decrease the protein level of PDX-1 and the expression of its major target genes such as glut2 and glucokinase. The interaction of PDX-1 with Ku subunits and its phosphorylation on threonine 11 by the DNA-PK appear to be implicated in its degradation by the proteosome. Thus, the DNA-PK-dependent phosphorylation of PDX-1 may regulate its function. Cell Lines and Antibodies—MIN6 and RIN-5AH cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 24 mm glucose with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. MIN6 cells were used between passage 25 and 30. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection. For immunoprecipitation experiments, PDX-1 antibody (generated in the Montminy's laboratory) was covalently cross-linked to protein A beads by using a standard protocol (25.Mattson G. Conklin E. Desai S. Nielander G. Savage M.D. Morgensen S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 17: 167-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins was performed with the FLAG-agarose beads from Promega (Madison, WI). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Ku70 and rabbit polyclonal anti-Ku80 were purchased from Serotec (Raleigh, NC) (AHP316 and AHP317, respectively). For the coimmunoprecipitation of Ku80 with the endogenous PDX-1, goat polyclonal anti-Ku86 (M-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) was used. Detection of CREB was performed by using an antibody generated in the Montminy's laboratory, and antibody revealing PBX1 (P-20) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The phospho-(Ser/Thr)ATM/ATR substrate and phosphothreonine (42H4) antibodies are from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The p53, phospho-specific (Ser-15) antibody 3 was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). Treatments—For UV treatment, cells were exposed to 50 J/m2 of a 254 nm light. Cells were alternatively exposed to 20 gray of γ-radiation using a 60Co source (Gammabeam 150-C). Treatment of cells with caffeine (0.1, 1, and 10 mm) or MG132 (50 μm) commenced 30–60 min before radiation. Forskolin (10 μm) was given 30 min before harvesting the cells. Lysis Buffers, Immunoprecipitations, and GST-Pull Down—For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, lysates were prepared using a 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm NaVO4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 buffer, pH 7.5, supplemented with protease inhibitors (pepstatin and leupeptin). Lysates were homogenized by sonication. During the 4 °C incubation for immunoprecipitation, the NaCl concentration was reduced to 150 mm. For GST-pull down experiments, cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of GST protein beads for 2 h. We tested the interaction of Ku subunits with GST/full-length PDX-1-(1–283), GST/N-terminal domain of PDX-1-(1–143), GST/homeodomain of PDX-1-(143–212), or GST/C-terminal domain of PDX-1-(212–283). In Vitro Phosphorylation—The partially purified DNA-PK was purchased from Promega (catalogue number V5811). The phosphorylation assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 μg of GST proteins were incubated in the presence or absence of purified DNA-PK with unlabeled or [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. The experiment was also performed in the presence or absence of DNA fragments (sonicated calf DNA) and 1 μm wortmannin. After the reaction, GST protein beads were incubated or not with 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated proteins were revealed by autoradiography or Western blotting using a phosphoserine/threonine antibody. Luciferase Assays—The transcriptional activities of PDX-1 wild type and mutant were measured using pM1Gal4-PDX-1 constructs. MIN6 cells were transfected with pM1Gal4-PDX-1WT or T11A and the reporter vector pFR-Luc. 40 h after transfection, the cells were treated with UV radiation (50 J/m2) and harvested 2 h after radiation. The activity of the different constructs was estimated by using a luciferase assay normalized by the expression of exogenous β-galactosidase. The activation of the insulin gene promoter was measured using a 250-bp fragment of the rat insulin-1 promoter subcloned upstream of the luciferase cDNA in the pCAT3 basic vector. The Trp-53-Luc construct was kindly provided by Dr. Puri (26.Puri P.L. Bhakta K. Wood L.D. Costanzo A. Zhu J. Wang J.Y. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The cross-linking was performed by 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then scraped off the plate, spun down, and lysed in 5 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 complemented with protease inhibitors. The nuclei were spun down and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) SDS, with protease inhibitors. To generate chromatin fragments of about 600 bp, the nuclei lysate was sonicated for a total of 30 s. The chromatin was then precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads for 15 min, and immunoprecipitations were prepared by using a nonimmune serum or an anti-PDX-1 antibody. After reversion of the cross-linking at 65 °C, DNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitates by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitated with ethanol. PCR using Insulin promoter primers was subsequently performed. Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells exposed or not to UV radiation (50 J/m2) by using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen. The extraction was performed 2 h or 5 h and 30 min after radiation treatment. cDNA generated by Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen) was analyzed by Q-PCR using a SYBR Green PCR kit and an ABIPRISM 7700 sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All data were normalized to ribosomal 36B4 expression. The following primers were used for PCRs: PDX-1, 5′-AAAACCGTCGCATGAAGTGG-3′ forward and 5′-CCCGCTACTACGTTTCTTATCTTCC-3′ reverse; Glut2, 5′-CCAGCTCCCTGGGATGAAGAGGAG-3′ forward and 5′-GATGAGGGCGTGTGCCGGTCC-3′ reverse; glucokinase, 5′-GGTGAATGACACGGTGGCC-3′ forward and 5′-CTCCAGCAGGAACTCGTCCAGC-3′ reverse; YWHAH, 5′-GCCTCTTAGCCAAACAAGCCTTC-3′ forward and 5′-TTCTTCATCCTGCTGGTCGCTC-3′ reverse; MAFK, 5′-CCTAATTTATTGCTGTACATGTTGCC-3′ forward and 5′-TTTATTGCAAAGATACAAAAGCAGTCAC-3′ reverse; and 36B4, 5′-CCACGAAAATCTCCAGAGGCAC-3′ forward and 5′-ATGATCAGCCCGAAGGAGAAGG-3′ reverse. Interaction of PDX-1 with Ku70 and Ku80—To reveal new cofactors of the transcription factor PDX-1, we have overexpressed a FLAG-tagged PDX-1 in 293T cells. FLAG-PDX-1 was immunoprecipitated using a FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The coimmunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Two proteins with molecular masses of 70 and 80 kDa appeared to be Ku70 and Ku80, respectively (data not shown). Because the expression of PDX-1 is mainly restricted to pancreatic beta cells, it was important to verify that this interaction occurred in beta cells. To do so, MIN6 cells were transfected with the FLAG-PDX-1 construct, and an immunoprecipitation was performed. As expected, we found that both Ku70 and Ku80 coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-PDX-1 (Fig. 1A, lane 1), and this interaction is outcompeted by the presence of an excess of the FLAG peptide (lane 2). To test the specificity of the interaction of Ku with PDX-1, we overexpressed two other FLAG-tagged transcription factors, PBX-1 and CREB, in MIN6 cells. PBX-1 contains a homeodomain and CREB a leucine zipper protein without a homeodomain. By using a FLAG antibody, we did not detect coimmunoprecipitation of Ku80 with FLAG-PBX-1 and FLAGCREB (Fig. 1B). This result confirms that the Ku subunits associate with PDX-1 and that the coimmunoprecipitation observed is not because of an artifactual interaction of Ku with the FLAG tag. To demonstrate that Ku is also able to interact with the endogenous PDX-1, we performed an immunoprecipitation of PDX-1 expressed in MIN6 using an antibody to PDX-1. As shown in Fig. 1C, Ku80 coimmunoprecipitates with endogenous PDX-1 (lane 2). As expected, no coimmunoprecipitation is observed using a nonimmune serum (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Because it has been demonstrated previously that Ku subunits can interact with the homeodomain of Oct-1 and HoxC4 (14.Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. Giffin W. Kochan J.C. Ngsee J.K. Traykova-Andonova M. Haché R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16848-16856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), two other homeobox transcription factors, we investigated whether the homeodomain of PDX-1 plays a role in the association of Ku70 and Ku80. To do so, we performed a GST-pull down using the following constructs of GST-PDX-1: GST/full-length PDX-1-(1–283) (GST/FL), GST/N-terminal domain of PDX-1-(1–143) (GST/N), GST/homeodomain of PDX-1-(144–243) (GST/HD), and GST/C-terminal domain of PDX-1-(244–283) (GST/C) (Fig. 1D). We found that GST/FL and GST/HD can pull down Ku70 and Ku80, but GST/N and GST/C do not, suggesting that the homeodomain of PDX-1 mediates its interaction with the Ku subunits. As a control we showed an interaction of GST-PDX-1 full length with the homeodomain protein PBX-1, which is known to associate with the conserved pentapeptide (YPWMK) located upstream of the PDX-1 homeodomain (27.Peers B. Sharma S. Johnson T. Kamps M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28.Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L.J. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M.

In Vitro Phosphorylation of PDX-1 by DNA-PK—Ku70 and Ku80 are the regulatory subunits of DNA-PK, and it has been demonstrated previously that this kinase is able to phosphorylate other homeodomain proteins like Oct-1 (14.Schild-Poulter C.

Shih A. Yarymowich N.C. Hache R.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7197-7205PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-PK phosphorylates many substrates on serine/threonine residues followed by glutamine ((S/T)Q) (29.Zernik-Kobak M. Vasunia K. Connelly M. Anderson C.W. Dixon K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23896-23904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30.Chan D.W. Ye R. Veillette C.J. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The analysis of the PDX-1 sequence shows a consensus site for DNA-PK phosphorylation in the N-terminal region. This site contains threonine 11 and is conserved in most species, with the exception of Zebrafish in which another consensus site exists at serine 29 (Fig. 2A). To determine whether DNA-PK can phosphorylate PDX-1, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using GST constructs of PDX-1 with purified DNA-PK containing the catalytic subunit and Ku proteins. We performed this experiment in the presence of unlabeled or radioactive ATP. As shown in Fig. 2B, left panel (lane 2), DNA-PK is able to phosphorylate PDX-1 wild type in vitro. As expected this phosphorylation occurs on serine and/or threonine residues as demonstrated by Western blotting using an antibody to phosphoserine/threonine. However, no phosphorylation was detected on PDX-1 mutated on threonine 11 (Fig. 2B, lane 4). To verify that this phosphorylation was generated by the DNA-PK activity, we performed the same experiment in the presence of 1 μm of wortmannin, which inhibits DNA-PK. As shown in Fig. 2B, right panel, the phosphorylation of PDX-1 by DNA-PK is abolished in presence of wortmannin (lane 3). This phosphorylation does not occur in the absence of DNA fragments, which is consistent with the fact that DNA-PK is activated by its interaction with DNA ends (Fig. 2B, right panel, lane 4) (31.Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S.A. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6904-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 32.Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). We also show that the phosphorylated form of GST/PDX-1WT is no longer detected after incubation with the alkaline phosphatase CIP (Fig. 2B, right panel, lane 5). To summarize, we demonstrated here that DNA-PK is able to phosphorylate PDX-1 in vitro and that this phosphorylation occurs on threonine 11. PDX-1 Is Phosphorylated on Threonine in Response to DNA Damage—To determine which stimuli induce threonine phosphorylation of PDX-1 in intact cells, we investigated whether the stimuli able to activate DNA-PK (such as DNA-damaging radiation) have an effect on PDX-1 phosphorylation. First, we treated MIN6 cells with γ-radiation (20 gray) or UV radiation (50 J) and immunoprecipitated endogenous PDX-1. We found that PDX-1 is indeed modified in response to both γ- and UV radiation. This modification appears as a new form of PDX-1 that migrates more slowly on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). As a serine/threonine-phosphorylated protein usually runs slower on SDS-PAGE than the nonphosphorylated form, we investigated whether the modification of PDX-1 observed after DNA damage corresponds to its phosphorylation on threonine. To do so, MIN6 cells were treated with UV light, and endogenous PDX-1 was immunoprecipitated. By using an antibody to phosphothreonine, we showed that UV radiation can induce threonine phosphorylation of PDX-1. As expected, treatment of immunoprecipitated PDX-1 with the alkaline phosphatase CIP abolished the threonine phosphorylation of PDX-1 and consistently inhibited the formation of the upper form of PDX-1 (Fig. 3B). As a control, we confirmed that UV radiation induced p53 phosphorylation (33.Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate that treatment with DNA-damaging agents results in PDX-1 phosphorylation on threonine in islet cells. To investigate further the role of DNA damage kinases in threonine phosphorylation of PDX-1 induced by DNA damage, we first treated MIN6 cells with caffeine. At low doses (up to 0.5 mm) caffeine is known to be a specific inhibitor of ATM and ATR kinases. However, starting at 5 mm, this drug is no longer specific for ATM and ATR and can also inhibit other phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases such as DNA-PK (34.Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). Preceding UV radiation, MIN6 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of caffeine (0.1 to 10 mm). As shown in Fig.3C, only a high dose of caffeine (10 mm) is able to inhibit the PDX-1 shift (lane 5). As a control of efficiency for UV light and caffeine treatments, a Western blot using an anti-phospho-p53 was performed. As expected, p53 was phosphorylated after UV radiation, and this phosphorylation was strongly inhibited after treatment with high doses of caffeine. This experiment suggested that neither ATM nor ATR are implicated in PDX-1 phosphorylation and that DNA-PK inhibition might correlate with the reduction of the upper form of PDX-1. However, we cannot exclude that another pathway inhibited by 10 mm caffeine was also implicated in the PDX-1 threonine phosphorylation induced by DNA damage. The Phosphorylation of PDX-1 on Threonine 11 Does Not Affect Its Transcriptional Activity or Its DNA Binding—To investigate the putative in vivo role of PDX-1 phosphorylation, we studied whether DNA-damaging treatment like UV radiation has an effect on PDX-1 DNA binding and/or on its transcriptional activity. To do so, we first treated RIN-5AH cells with UV radiation and extracted chromatin as described under the “Materials and Methods.” After immunoprecipitation and by using a nonimmune serum or a PDX-1-specific antibody, PCR amplifying the PDX-1-linked-insulin promoter region was performed. As shown in Fig. 4A, no change in PDX-1 DNA binding was observed after UV treatment. The same result was obtained with the glucokinase promoter (data not shown). These results suggest that PDX-1 threonine phosphorylation does not modulate the binding of PDX-1 to the promoters of its target genes. To search further for a role of threonine 11 on PDX-1 transcriptional activity, we generated a Gal4 construct containing PDX-1 mutated on threonine 11. The transcriptional activity of this construct has been tested in MIN6 cells, in parallel with the wild type form of PDX-1, subsequent to treatment or not with UV radiation. As indicated by Fig. 4B, only a modest decrease in PDX-1 wild type and mutant activities was seen in response to UV radiation. This is consistent with the results described previously concerning the binding of PDX-1 to its target promoters. Moreover, we observed that the threonine 11 mutant presents the same transcriptional activity as wild type PDX-1. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of PDX-1 on threonine 11 induced after DNA-damaging treatment is not implicated in the regulation of PDX-1 transcriptional activity. UV Radiation Induces a Decrease in PDX-1 Protein Expression—To investigate the biological effect of radiation on PDX-1, we studied PDX-1 protein expression at different times after UV radiation. MIN6 cells were irradiated with UV light 50 J/m2 and cells were harvested 1, 5, and 10 h after irradiation. Expression of PDX-1 was then revealed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5A, PDX-1 protein expression starts to decrease within 5 h after UV treatment and is dramatically reduced after 10 h (upper panel). As expected, the phosphorylation of p53 was detected as early as 1 h, confirming the effect of UV treatment (Fig. 5A, lower panel). In contrast to our observations concerning PDX-1, no decrease in CREB protein expression was obtained in response to UV radiation (Fig. 5A, middle panel), suggesting that the effect observed for PDX-1 was not because of a general shut down of the translational machinery. Next, we wanted to determine whether the phosphorylated form of PDX-1 obtained after treatment with DNA-damaging agents was implicated in the decreased protein expression. To do so, MIN6 cells were treated or not with 50 μm MG132, a proteosome inhibitor, and exposed or not to 50 J/m2 of UV radiation. We demonstrated that the amount of the upper form of PDX-1 was increased by MG132 treatment (Fig. 4B) suggesting that the form of PDX-1, corresponding to the threonine phosphorylated form, could be at least partially degraded by the proteosome. These experiments demonstrate that the PDX-1 protein is degraded in response to UV radiation and that the threonine phosphorylation of PDX-1 may be implicated in this degradation via the proteosomal machinery.

https://openalex.org/W2131615898,"We have used the dimerization initiation site of HIV-1 genomic RNA as a model to investigate hairpin-duplex interconversion with a combination of fluorescence, UV melting, gel electrophoresis, and x-ray crystallographic techniques. Fluorescence studies with molecular beacons and crystallization experiments with 23-nucleotide dimerization initiation site fragments showed that the ratio of hairpin to duplex formed after annealing in water essentially depends on RNA concentration and not on cooling kinetics. With natural sequences allowing to form the most stable duplex, and thus also the loop-loop complex (or “kissing complex”), concentrations as low as 3 μm in strands are necessary to obtain a majority of the hairpin form. With a mutated sequence preventing kissing complex formation, a majority of hairpins was even obtained at 80 μm in strands. However, this did not prevent an efficient conversion from hairpin to duplex in the presence of salts. Kinetic considerations are in favor of duplex formation from intermediates involving hairpins engaged in cruciform dimers rather than from free strands. The very first step of formation of such a cruciform intermediate could be trapped in a crystal structure. This mechanism might be significant for the dynamics of small RNAs beyond the strict field of HIV-1.

This mechanism might be significant for the dynamics of small RNAs beyond the strict field of HIV-1. Stem-loops and bulged loops are common motifs found in RNA secondary structure and are often involved in RNA-protein or RNA-RNA recognition. Because of the self-complementarity of stems, a stem-loop structure can also adopt an alternative duplex structure containing unpaired nucleotides. This hairpin-duplex equilibrium also represents a major problem in structural studies of nucleic acids by NMR and x-ray crystallography, both requiring concentrated samples. Strategies using a mixture of unlabeled and 15N-labeled oligonucleotides were developed to discriminate between the two species by NMR (1Aboul-ela F. Nikonowicz E.P. Pardi A.

However, many attempts at crystallizing RNA or DNA stem-loop structures led unexpectedly to duplex crystal structures (3Jovine L. Hainzl T. Oubridge C. Scott W.G. Li J. Sixma T.K. Wonacott A.

This was even the case for the unusually stable RNA tetraloops belonging to the GNRA, UNCG, and CUUG families, which are supposed to be nucleation points for RNA folding because of their stability and quick folding kinetics (see “Discussion” in Ref. 7Ennifar E. Nikulin A. Tishchenko S. Serganov A. Nevskaya N. Garber M. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Nikonov S. Dumas P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304 (references therein): 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Significantly, this problem does not seem to spread to NMR studies because several RNA stem-loop structures were successfully solved by using this technique, whereas most of the hairpin structures described by x-ray crystallography were obtained from complexes with proteins (8Oubridge C.

The only notable exception is the GAGA tetraloop found in the sarcin-ricin loop, successfully crystallized as a hairpin (11Correll C.C. Munishkin A. Chan Y.L. Ren Z. Wool I.G. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl.

The present study focuses on the dimerization initiation site (DIS) 4The abbreviations used are: DISdimerization initiation siteHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusNCp7nucleocapsid protein (7 kDa)MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidFAM5 (and 6)-carboxyfluoresceinPurpurineTARtrans-activation response elementcTARcomplementary TAR. 4The abbreviations used are: DISdimerization initiation siteHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusNCp7nucleocapsid protein (7 kDa)MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidFAM5 (and 6)-carboxyfluoresceinPurpurineTARtrans-activation response elementcTARcomplementary TAR. of HIV-1 genomic RNA that has been extensively studied by several biochemical and biophysical methods. This strongly conserved stem-loop sequence (13St. Louis D.C. Gotte D. Sanders-Buell E. Ritchey D.W. Salminen M.O. Carr J.K. McCutchan F.E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3991-3998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a) was shown to be crucial for viral RNA dimerization and packaging, two major determinants of viral infectivity (14Paillart J.-C.

Biol. 1996; 259: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The DIS loop is made of nine nucleotides, six of them being self-complementary. This allows the DIS to initiate RNA dimerization through loop-loop interaction and formation of a “kissing complex” (for a review see Ref. 16Paillart J.-C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b). Among all natural HIV-1 isolates, only two self-complementary sequences are commonly found, AGGUGCACA and AAGCGCGCA, representative of HIV-1 subtypes A and B, respectively (13St. Louis D.C. Gotte D. Sanders-Buell E. Ritchey D.W. Salminen M.O. Carr J.K. McCutchan F.E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3991-3998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the DIS can dimerize as a duplex form through extension of intermolecular base pairing of the kissing complex (Fig. 1b). This extended duplex is associated with the stabilization of the dimer observed in vitro upon heat treatment at 55 °C or by the addition of the viral nucleocapsid protein NCp7 (17Muriaux D.

Here we use a 23-nucleotide fragment of the HIV-1 DIS as a model to address the question of the dynamics of hairpin-duplex interconversion for short self-complementary RNA sequences. The present work started with our first attempts at crystallizing the kissing complex form of the DIS, which led to the crystallization of the duplex form (18Yusupov M. Walter P. Marquet R. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Dumas P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 19Ennifar E. Yusupov M. Walter P. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Structure. 1999; 7: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) as frequently observed for other RNA hairpin structures. As usually done, we were relying on a “flash cooling” of the RNA sample to freeze the RNA molecules into their hairpin conformation and prevent duplex formation. This remained unsuccessful. We finally obtained kissing complex crystals (20Ennifar E. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), but only after sufficient lowering of the RNA concentrations during the annealing procedure, which was an obvious indicator of a strong duplex-forming propensity. It thus became evident that a direct method of investigation was necessary to delineate a “cooling time-RNA concentration” phase diagram. The hairpin-duplex equilibrium for the DIS(Mal) and DIS(Lai) wild-type sequences, representative of HIV-1 subtypes A and B, was investigated by labeling both sequences at their 3′ and 5′ extremities with a dye and a fluorescence quencher, respectively, thus forming a molecular beacon (21Tyagi S. Kramer F.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (3574) Google Scholar). Such a labeled sequence, when mixed with the excess of an unlabeled sequence, allows us to distinguish unambiguously the DIS hairpin within the kissing complex, from the duplex form (Fig. 2). We also reinvestigated hairpin-duplex interconversion for the HIV-1 DIS by UV-melting studies. This led us to point a subtle difference between the DIS(Mal) and DIS(Lai) sequences because of close duplex and hairpin melting temperatures. Finally, we showed that the formation of a stable kissing complex is not necessary to convert significantly a hairpin form into a duplex at low temperature. Instead, with a loop sequence preventing kissing complex formation, we found that duplex formation can only be explained by hairpins forming cruciform intermediates, and not by their full melting prior to strand re-association. Possible biological implications of this process in the HIV-1 life cycle, and beyond the strict field of HIV-1, are discussed. RNA Synthesis and Purification—DIS(Mal) and DIS(Lai) sequences doubly labeled as molecular beacons were chemically synthesized in our laboratory on a 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with synthons from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Labeling of the 5′ terminus with 5 (and 6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) was performed via an amino-linker with a six-carbon spacer arm. The 3′ terminus was labeled with a universal fluorescence quencher, the 4-(4′-dimethylethyl-aminophenylazo)benzoic acid. Unlabeled and 5′-FAM singly labeled RNA sequences were purchased from Dharmacon (Boulder, CO). The unlabeled sequences correspond to the natural DIS(Mal) and DIS(Lai) sequences and to the mutated sequences DIS-UU, DIS-Pur280, DIS-C275, and DIS-HxG278 (Fig. 1a). The DIS-UU, containing an unstable U-U mismatch at the beginning of the stem, was designed for previous crystallization studies of the loop-loop complex (20Ennifar E. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The RNAs were purified as described previously (19Ennifar E. Yusupov M. Walter P. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Structure. 1999; 7: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation—Oligonucleotide concentrations (expressed in strands) were derived from extinction coefficients at 260 nm of 223,200 m-1 cm-1 for DIS(Mal), 216,400 m-1 cm-1 for DIS(Lai), 220,100 m-1 cm-1 for DIS-C275, 225,100 m-1 cm-1 for DIS-HxG278, and 224,600 m-1 cm-1 for DIS-UU. RNA folding was achieved by diluting the samples in 200 μl of water in an Eppendorf tube at different concentrations (0.6, 6, and 60 μm), heating at 90 °C for 3 min, and then cooling to 0 °C with three different kinetics. The two fast cooling kinetics were monitored with a thermocouple plugged to a data acquisition module OMB-DAQ-55 (Omega Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT). First, slow cooling was achieved by imposing a linear decrease of temperature for 3 h. Second, a so-called “fast cooling” was achieved in melting ice, which results in a rather slow exponential decrease of temperature with a half-time between 10 and 19 s depending on the position of the thermocouple between the wall and the center of the Eppendorf tube. Finally, a supposedly “ultra-fast cooling” was achieved in ethanol maintained at -70 °C with dry ice. This results in cooling with an average half-time of 5 s, until a plateau is reached at 0 °C and maintained during a few seconds because of ice formation. Notably, 16-18 s are still necessary to go from 90 to 0 °C with the latter method. Optical Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 20.0 ± (0.5) °C on an SLM-Aminco 8100 spectrofluorimeter (SLM, Urbana, IL) using a 150-watt xenon lamp. The excitation and emission bandwidths were 8 nm. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed by mixing a fixed concentration of DIS molecular beacon (60 nm) with an excess of nonlabeled RNA. The nonlabeled RNA to molecular beacon ratios ranged from 10 to 1000, corresponding to a total RNA concentration ranging from 600 nm to 60 μm. Samples were folded as described above, and measurements were achieved in water to probe the result of the folding in the absence of salt and buffer. The fluorescence signal was found stable and reproducible in such conditions. To evaluate the influence of the excess of nonlabeled RNA on the fluorescence of the FAM dye, experiments were repeated by using a singly labeled DIS-5′-FAM. For each value of the ratio, the relative increase of fluorescence (R) was calculated. To determine the percentage of extended duplex forms in solution, R values were then compared with the increase of fluorescence relative to the singly labeled DIS-5′-FAM, which corresponds to the full fluorescence restoration that can be obtained by this system. Absorption spectra were recorded either on a Cary 4E (Varian, Sydney, Australia) or with a Uvikon XL (SECOMAM, Domont, France) spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier thermostated cell holder. Melting curves were recorded at 260 nm with a heating rate of 0.25 °C·min-1 between 10 and 85 °C. The temperature was measured by a thermocouple inserted into one cell. 20 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 25 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate were used as buffer. Melting Curve Processing—The UV melting curves were processed within the frame of the usual two-state approximation (22Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1980: 1109-1264Google Scholar). However, we derived the melting temperature (Tm) and variation of enthalpy ΔH by using a method slightly different from the usual one. 5P. Dumas, S. Bernacchi, and E. Ennifar, manuscript in preparation. The DIS(Mal) showed a concentration-independent hairpin melting at high temperature and could be analyzed following this method. For the DIS(Lai), however, the situation was more complicated and a detailed analysis, based upon numerical integration of the set of differential equations describing the different equilibriums, was necessary to explain the observations. 5P. Dumas, S. Bernacchi, and E. Ennifar, manuscript in preparation. Gel Electrophoresis Experiments and Quantification—DIS-C275 RNA samples were prepared (at concentrations of 20, 9, 4.5, and 2.2 μm) as described above and analyzed on 15 or 20% native PAGE performed at 4 °C in TBM buffer (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm MgCl2). Hairpin and duplex quantification was performed on a Gel Doc 1000 (Bio-Rad) after ethidium bromide (EtBr) staining of the gel after electrophoresis. Because a dimeric duplex probably retains more than twice the amount of ethidium bromide retained by a monomeric hairpin, we used a ratio of 2.5. The data obtained in such a way yielded ∼10% of the duplex form after annealing in water, in good agreement with 12% from fluorescence measurement. For the sake of comparison, the experiment on the effect of magnesium concentration at 2 μm RNA was quantified by 32P labeling. The RNAs were 5′-end-labeled for 30 min at 37 °C with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Radioactivity was measured on a BAS 2000 Bio-Imager (Fuji). The quantification was performed with a specific program written with Mathematica (Wolfram Research). RNA Crystallization—For kissing complex crystallization, RNA samples were diluted in water to 6 μm or less, annealed at 90 °C, and either submitted to the fast cooling protocol or slowly cooled to room temperature. A low salt dimerization buffer (8 mm MgCl2, 30 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0) was added prior to incubation at 37 °C for 1 h (however, further refinement of the crystallization protocol showed that this dimerization step was not required), and samples were concentrated to 360-600 μm. Drops were made by mixing 3 μl of RNA sample with 3 μl of a well solution (100 mm ammonium sulfate, 50 mm MES, pH 5.6, 20% PEG 8000, 10 mm MgCl2) and 2 μl of a 3 mm spermine solution. Single platelets crystals (up to 0.8 mm in size) belonging to the space group C2221 were obtained after 2-3 days of equilibration by vapor diffusion at 37 °C. Kissing complex crystals were also obtained with a mutated DIS(Mal) sequence, where the 1st bp of the stem was replaced by a U-U mismatch. This DIS-UU sequence was crystallized as a kissing complex in different conditions but by using a similar protocol. After annealing, the dimerization buffer (8 mm MgCl2, 30 mm sodium cacodylate, and 7 mm spermine) was added. The sample was concentrated to 150 μm, and drops were made by mixing 1 volume of RNA sample with 1 volume of well solution (20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 15% isopropyl alcohol). Large platelet crystals (up to 1 mm) of space group C2 were obtained at 20 °C within 2-4 days. DIS(Mal) duplex crystals were obtained as described previously in Ref. 19Ennifar E. Yusupov M. Walter P. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Structure. 1999; 7: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar. Numerical Values—The different kinetic and equilibrium “constants” were expressed as in Equations 1, 2, 3,kon(T)=k0e-EaRT(Eq. 1) koff(T)=kon(T)K(T)(Eq. 2) K(T)=eΔHR(1Tm-1T)(Eq. 3) with R the gas constant (1.987 cal·mol-1·K-1; 1 cal = 4.184 J); T the absolute temperature; Tm the melting temperature (K); Ea the activation energy; ΔH the variation of enthalpy (kcal·mol-1); k0 the pre-exponential factor (min-1 for a unimolecular transition and m-1 min-1 for a bimolecular transition); and K(T) the equilibrium constant. In the following the kinetic and equilibrium constants for hairpin and duplex formation will be numbered 1 and 2, respectively. For hairpin formation K1(T) is dimensionless, and Tm1 is concentration-independent, whereas for duplex formation K2(T) has the dimension of m-1 and Tm2 is given for a standard concentration of 1 m in strands. For hairpin closing, the kinetic constant is almost temperature-independent with kon ∼ 105 s-1 and koff = kon at T = Tm1 (23Turner D.H. Bloomfield V.A. Crothers D.M. Tinocco I. Nucleic Acids, Structure, Properties, and Functions. University Science Books, Sausalito, CA2000: 259-334Google Scholar). The activation energy Ea1 of hairpin opening is close and at least equal to |ΔH1| involved in hairpin closing. For duplex formation, the kinetic constant k0 is of order 106 m-1 s-1, and the (apparent) activation energy Ea2 may be negative because of duplex formation not being an elementary mechanism (24Porschke D. Eigen M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 62: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 25Craig M.E. Crothers D.M. Doty P. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 62: 383-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Values less than -5 kcal·mol-1 are possible. Hairpin-Duplex Equilibrium—Kissing complex and duplex forms cannot be easily quantified in solution by classical gel studies because both forms have the same overall shape and essentially the same base-pairing pattern (19Ennifar E. Yusupov M. Walter P. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Structure. 1999; 7: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Ennifar E. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess the effect of cooling kinetics and RNA concentration, we used DIS sequences labeled as molecular beacons (21Tyagi S. Kramer F.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (3574) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). By mixing such doubly labeled 23-mer DIS with an excess of unlabeled RNA, we quantified the relative amount of duplex and consequently the amount of hairpins (either free or in kissing complexes). We observed for “slow” and “fast cooling” that the hairpin is predominant at low RNA concentrations (less than 3 μm), whereas almost only duplex species are formed at 60 μm (Fig. 3). Our results clearly show that in this DIS system, the RNA concentration, and not the kinetics of cooling, is by far the predominant parameter for obtaining the hairpin form after the folding procedure. More importantly, we reproducibly observed an important increase of fluorescence in a narrow RNA concentration range (from 3 to 6 μm) with the ultra-fast cooling procedure. At first glance this might indicate an unexpected increase of duplex formation under conditions that favor the hairpin form. In this case, however, the enhanced increase of fluorescence most likely results from kinetically trapped misfolded di- or multimeric species. Finally, to test whether the observed increase of fluorescence was indeed specifically because of duplex formation, an excess of DIS-HxG278 containing a stem sequence partly inverted and unable to heterodimerize with the wild-type DIS sequence (Fig. 1a) was mixed with a fixed amount of molecular beacon. As shown in Fig. 3, no significant increase of fluorescence is observed in such conditions, which is strong evidence that its increase with a wild-type DIS is not because of unspecific effects. We also performed similar investigations with the DIS-C275 mutant of the DIS(Mal) (Fig. 1a) by using gel electrophoresis techniques. As described in Ref. 26Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27486-27493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, the C275 mutation in the loop on the DIS(Mal) sequence abolishes kissing complex formation by introducing two highly destabilizing A-C mismatches in the loop-loop helix. This mutant was thus very convenient to study the hairpin-duplex transition by using classical gel experiments as described in Ref. 27Kirchner R. Vogtherr M. Limmer S. Sprinzl M. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar. The fraction of duplex was first evaluated in water, immediately after the cooling procedure, as a function of RNA concentration and of the kinetics of cooling. As observed with molecular beacons, our results on the gel emphasize the importance of the RNA concentration during RNA folding in comparison with a minor effect of the cooling process (Fig. 4). However, the hairpin fraction for the DIS-C275 mutant is much higher than for the wild-type sequence for all tested concentrations. Thermal Stability of the DIS Sequence—We further investigated the kissing complex/duplex equilibrium by UV melting. A previous study made on the DIS(Lai) concluded that the kissing complex was converted into the duplex form at low temperature (around 25-30 °C), followed by a melting of the latter at 61 °C (28Theilleux-Delalande V. Girard F. Huynh-Dinh T. Lancelot G. Paoletti J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2711-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The identification of the major peak of the differential melting curve as corresponding to duplex melting was based on the dependence of the melting temperature with concentration. However, on the basis of theoretical considerations and of a large body of experimental results in the literature (for example see Refs. 29Marky L.A. Blumenfeld K.S. Kozlowski S. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 1247-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar and 30Scheffler I.E. Elson E.L. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 36: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we were led to question the fact that the DIS hairpin could melt at such a low temperature. In addition, our own results on the DIS(Mal) showed a concentration-independent peak at 72 °C (Fig. 5a) yielding an enthalpy value consistent with a 7-bp hairpin (|ΔH1| = 51.5 kcal·mol-1). Furthermore, by interpreting the high temperature peak for the DIS(Lai) as that of duplex melting not only led to poor fit of the experimental curves (not shown) but also to unacceptably low enthalpy values for a 20-bp duplex (around 60 kcal·mol-1). Finally, another clue was obtained by considering two DIS(Mal) mutants. The DIS-C275 mutant (Fig. 1a) unable to form a kissing complex, but not a hairpin, showed the same hairpin melting temperature and a significant modification at lower temperatures that can only be interpreted as duplex destabilization (Fig. 5b). In addition, the Pur280 mutant (Fig. 1a) obtained by the replacement of the A280 base by an adenine base deprived of its exocyclic amino group led to a significant modification of the melting profile (Fig. 5b), which is also because of duplex destabilization, whereas the peak characteristic of the hairpin at 72 °C remained unaffected. This fits perfectly with the DIS(Mal) duplex being affected by an A280Pur modification because A280 is engaged in a G-A “Watson-Crick-like” base pair in this duplex (19Ennifar E. Yusupov M. Walter P. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Structure. 1999; 7: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and with the hairpin being unaffected by the same modification because A280 is unpaired in the kissing complex (20Ennifar E. Walter P. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Dumas P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Notably, the G-A mismatches contributing to duplex stability is well documented (31Santa Lucia Jr., J. Kierzek R. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8813-8819Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32Schroeder S. Kim J. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16105-16109Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Longfellow C.E. Kierzek R. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This also indicated that, in the range of concentrations in use, the melting of the DIS(Mal) duplex occurs at a temperature close to and below that of the hairpin. By comparison with the DIS(Mal), it was thus beyond any doubt that the major peak of the differential melting curve for the closely related DIS(Lai) was also a mark of the hairpin. However, as recalled above, this peak was concentration-dependent (28Theilleux-Delalande V. Girard F. Huynh-Dinh T. Lancelot G. Paoletti J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2711-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which is in contradiction with a purely unimolecular transition. We finally clarified the situation by showing that the concentration dependence is because of almost simultaneous melting of the hairpin and of the duplex, and not to pure duplex melting. This was done by making use of numerical simulations that were confirmed by experiments.5 This led to the conclusion that the subtle different behavior of the two sequences is because of the melting temperature of the DIS(Lai) duplex being close enough to that of the hairpin to cause an apparent concentration dependence of it, whereas the melting temperature of the DIS(Mal) duplex is sufficiently far from that of the hairpin to prevent any interference. The simulations also showed that the melting of the duplex interfering with that of the hairpin for the DIS(Lai) led to a sharpening of the concentration-dependent peak, which was indeed observed (Fig. 5a). Hairpin-to-Duplex Conversion for the DIS-C275 Mutant—Subsequently, we analyzed whether the formation of a kissing complex is a prerequisite for the DIS hairpin-duplex transition. For that, we used gel electrophoresis of the DIS-C275 mutant (Fig. 1a) unable to form a kissing complex. This RNA was folded at 20 μm, which led to 10% of duplex according to Fig. 3. It was then incubated, either in water at 37 °C, or in presence of salts (20 mm"

Initial characterization of the mouse PPARβ promoter revealed an AP-1 site that is crucial for the regulation of PPARβ expression in response to inflammatory cytokines in the skin. We now present evidence for a novel regulatory mechanism of the expression of the PPARβ gene by which two members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors inhibit its basal promoter activity in mouse keratinocytes. We first demonstrate that C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, but not C/EBPδ, inhibit the expression of PPARβ through the recruitment of a transcriptional repressor complex containing HDAC-1 to a specific C/EBP binding site on the PPARβ promoter. Consistent with this repression, the expression patterns of PPARβ and C/EBPs are mutually exclusive in keratinocytes of the interfollicular epidermis and hair follicles in mouse developing skin. This work reveals the importance of the regulatory interplay between PPARβ and C/EBP transcription factors in the control of proliferation and differentiation in this organ.

Such insights are crucial for the understanding of the molecular control regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation in many cell types including keratinocytes. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) 3The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; AP-1, activator protein-1; K10, keratin 10; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; P1-P7, postnatal days 1-7, respectively; HA, hemagglutinin; HDAC, histone deacetylase. are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor family. Three isotypes encoded by separate genes have been identified in vertebrates, PPARα (NR1C1), PPARβ/δ (NR1C2; called β below), and PPARγ (NR1C3), which have a variety of functions (1.Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar). Most particularly, the importance of PPARs in regulating lipid metabolism (2.Desvergne B. Michalik L. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) has led to investigate PPAR expression and function during the differentiation of the skin, a tissue with high rates of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. We previously showed that the three PPAR isotypes, and predominantly PPARβ, are expressed in the interfollicular epidermis and hair follicles during embryonic mouse development (3.Di Poi N. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Lipids. 2004; 39: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In adult skin, PPARβ is very low in interfollicular keratinocytes, but its expression is reactivated upon proliferative stimuli such as cutaneous injury and hair plucking (4.Michalik L. Desvergne B. Tan N.S. Basu-Modak S. Escher P. Rieusset J. Peters J.M. Kaya G. Gonzalez F.J. Zakany J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Duboule D. Wahli W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 799-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Using specific PPAR agonists and in vivo gene disruption approaches in mice, we demonstrated the critical role of PPARβ in regulating the balance between proliferation and apoptosis in keratinocytes during skin wound healing (4.Michalik L.

Michalik L. Wahli W. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2002; 10: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPARβ was reported to keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal permeability maturation under normal and inflammatory conditions (3.Di Poi N. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Lipids. 2004; 39: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5.Tan N.S. Michalik L. Noy N. Yasmin R. Pacot C. Heim M. Fluhmann B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) are members of the basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors and also play pivotal roles in the regulation of human and mouse skin homeostasis. Genes coding for six C/EBP isotypes (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, C/EBPγ, C/EBPϵ, and C/EBPζ or CHOP-10) have been cloned and characterized in mammalian cells (9.Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All C/EBPϵ consist of three structural domains: a C-terminal leucine zipper domain, a highly conserved canonical basic region, and an N-terminal domain, which contains both positive and negative regulatory regions (10.Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The basic region allows binding to specific palindromic CCAAT motifs located in the promoter of C/EBP target genes (11.Osada S. Yamamoto H. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), whereas the leucine zipper motif is responsible for homo- and heterodimerization between C/EBP members, which is absolutely required for DNA binding as well as transcriptional activity. C/EBPs also interact with many other basic leucine zipper and nonbasic leucine zipper factors such as NF-κB, p21, and activator protein-1 (AP-1) (9.Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They control the transcription of many key genes, either as transcriptional activators or repressors, demonstrating the importance of this family of transcription factors in the regulation of a number of cellular processes, including energy metabolism, inflammation, and liver regeneration (9.Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, they are well known regulators of the balance between differentiation and proliferation in various cell types like adipocytes, keratinocytes, granulocytes, and hepatocytes (9.Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Johnson P.F. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the skin, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are the most abundantly expressed isotypes in keratinocytes from the interfollicular and follicular epidermis (13.Maytin E.V. Lin J.C. Krishnamurthy R. Batchvarova N.

Prodifferentiative and antiproliferative functions of these two proteins have been characterized in keratinocytes, on the basis of their expression profiles and presence of binding sites in the promoter region of genes encoding early and late keratinocyte differentiation markers, such as keratin 10 (K10), K1, and involucrin (13.Maytin E.V.

In accordance, analysis of C/EBPβ-null epidermis revealed a mild epidermal hyperplasia and slightly decreased expression of epidermal differentiation markers (15.Zhu S. Oh H.S. Shim M. Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. Smart R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7181-7190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it has been recently reported that C/EBPα and C/EBPβ have a specific expression pattern during the mouse hair growth cycle, suggesting that C/EBP family members may also regulate gene expression during hair cycling (16.Bull J.J. Muller-Rover S. Chronnell C.M. Paus R. Philpott M.P. McKay I.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and sebocyte differentiation (20.Chen W. Yang C.C. Sheu H.M. Seltmann H. Zouboulis C.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The important roles of PPARs and C/EBPs identified in skin strongly suggest that both families of transcription factors may closely interact to regulate the epidermal and/or hair follicle differentiation program. In favor of this hypothesis, an interplay between PPARs and C/EBPs was observed during the differentiation of adipocytes (21.Grimaldi P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), sebocytes (20.Chen W. Yang C.C. Sheu H.M. Seltmann H. Zouboulis C.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and astrocytes (22.Cristiano L. Cimini A. Moreno S. Ragnelli A.M. Paola C.M. Neuroscience. 2005; 131: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide compelling evidence for the transcriptional repression in mouse keratinocytes of PPARβ expression by C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, through a mechanism that requires both binding to DNA and histone deacetylation. Consistent with this, PPARβ and C/EBP expression are mutually exclusive in the interfollicular epidermis and hair follicles of mouse skin. Such interplay between PPARβ and C/EBP transcription factors is crucial in the molecular control of the balance between differentiation and proliferation in keratinocytes and many other cell types. Reagents—The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A was from Cell Signaling (catalog number 9950). All cell culture media and supplies were obtained from Sigma. The following antibodies were used: anti-PPARβ (PA1-823), anti-HDAC-1 (PA1-860), and anti-HDAC-2 (PA1-861) from Affinity Bioreagents; anti-acetyl-histone H4 (catalog number 06-866) from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-C/EBPα (sc-61), anti-C/EBPβ (sc-150), anti-HDAC-1 C-19 (sc-6298), HA-probe (sc-805), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (sc-2012) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-HA tag (catalog number 2362) from Cell Signaling; and anti-β-tubulin (catalog number 556321) from Pharmingen. Plasmid Constructs—cDNAs encoding mouse C/EBPα (mC/EBPα), mC/EBPβ and mC/EBPδ were subcloned with an N-terminal epitope tag into pCMV-HA (Clontech). mC/EBPα and mC/EBPβ deletion mutants were generated using specific PCR amplification according to the arrangement of their structural domains (10.Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The dominant negative mC/EBPα (K299E) and mC/EBPβ (K238E) were created by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (23.Harris T.E. Albrecht J.H. Nakanishi M.

The full-length (1880 bp, accession number AF329818) and truncated proximal mouse PPARβ promoter regions were previously described (5.Tan N.S. Michalik L. Noy N. Yasmin R. Pacot C. Heim M. Fluhmann B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and were subcloned upstream of a promoterless luciferase reporter construct (pGL-luc) (24.Tan N.S. Michalik L. Di Poi N. Ng C.Y. Mermod N. Roberts A.B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the C/EBP binding site at position -494/-495 into the PPARβ promoter was achieved using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—Mouse BALB/MK keratinocytes were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Joklik modification) containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 0.05 mm CaCl2, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 5 μg/ml gentamycin. Transient transfection assays were performed in 12-well plates using Superfect reagent (Qiagen), and luciferase activity was measured with the Promega dual reporter kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. To reduce the background, all transfections were performed in the absence of fetal calf serum. Real Time PCR—Total RNA from mouse keratinocytes was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using 1 μg of total RNA (GeneAmp Gold RNA PCR reagent kit; Applied Biosystems) and analyzed by quantitative PCR using the SYBR Green I kit (Eurogentec) and the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. The thermocycler was programmed as follows: 95 °C for 10 min; 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s; 60 °C for 1 min. The housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase was used for normalization. The following primers were used: forward primer PPARβ,5′-CGGCAGCCTCAACATGG-3′; reverse primer PPARβ,5′-AGATCCGATCGCACTTCTCATAC-3′; forward primer PPARγ,5′-TGATTACAAATATGACCTGAAGCTCC-3′; reverse primer PPARγ,5′-TTGTAGAGCTGGGTCTTTTCAGAAT-3′; forward primer hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, 5′-TTAAGCAGTACAGCCCCAAAATG-3′; reverse primer hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, 5′-TCCTTTTCACCAGCAAGCTTG-3′. In Vivo Protein-Protein Cross-link and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Protein-protein cross-link and ChIP were performed as previously described (8.Di Poi N. Tan N.S. Michalik L. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 15 min before sonication in lysis buffer (10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) to obtain cross-linked DNA fragments of 200-600 bp in length. The immunoprecipitates were reverse cross-linked for PCR or boiled for 5 min in SDS loading buffer for Western blot analysis. For double chromatin immunoprecipitation (re-ChIP) assays, complexes were eluted from the agarose beads by sequential incubation with one volume of Immunopure Gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer (Pierce), followed by one volume of the same buffer containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The eluates were pooled, diluted 20-fold in re-ChIP dilution buffer (1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and subjected to another ChIP procedure. ChIP and re-ChIP assays were done using anti-acetyl-histone H4, HA-probe, and/or HDAC-1 C-19 antibodies. PCR was performed using 25 cycles with primers flanking either the C/EBP response element (-567 to -284) or an unrelated control sequence (-1179 to -894) on the mouse PPARβ promoter. Immunohistochemistry—Immunofluorescent staining on mouse skin cryosections was carried out as follows: fixation for 5 min with 75% acetone and 25% ethanol; blockage for 1 h with 5% normal goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin; incubation with the primary antibody (C/EBPα, 1:100; C/EBPβ, 1:100) for 1 h with 5% normal goat serum; incubation with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution of 1:200) for 1 h with 5% normal goat serum. Samples were mounted in 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing Vecta-shield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Colorimetric staining for PPARβ was carried out as previously described (6.Di Poi N. Ng C.Y. Tan N.S. Yang Z. Hemmings B.A. Desvergne B. Michalik L. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1696-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Western Blot Assays—Western blots were performed according to standard procedures, as previously described (6.Di Poi N. Ng C.Y. Tan N.S. Yang Z. Hemmings B.A. Desvergne B. Michalik L. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1696-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against HDAC-1, HDAC-2, and β-tubulin were used at dilutions of 1:2000, and the anti-HA antibody was diluted 1:1000. Detection was performed using chemiluminescence (Pierce) with horseradish peroxidase. PPARβ, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ Are Highly Expressed in the Developing Mouse Skin—The important roles of PPAR and C/EBP transcription factors in regulating overlapping pathways in keratinocytes strongly suggest that both families of transcription factors closely interact to regulate the differentiation program of the skin. In favor of this hypothesis, similar expression patterns of PPARs and C/EBPs were previously reported during sebocyte differentiation in this organ (20.Chen W. Yang C.C. Sheu H.M. Seltmann H. Zouboulis C.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first performed a detailed analysis of the expression of PPARβ and of the two main C/EBP isotypes, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, in the developing mouse skin from postnatal day 1 to 7 (P1-P7) by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1). As we previously described (6.Di Poi N. Ng C.Y. Tan N.S. Yang Z. Hemmings B.A. Desvergne B. Michalik L. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1696-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the PPARβ protein is highly expressed in the basal layer keratinocytes of the interfollicular epidermis as well as in the proliferative epithelial compartments of developing hair follicles, including hair pegs and hair matrix (Fig. 1A). On the contrary, and consistent with previous reports (13.Maytin E.V. Lin J.C. Krishnamurthy R. Batchvarova N. Ron D. Mitchell P.J. Habener J.F. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14.Oh H.S. Smart R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 939-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), C/EBPα is mainly expressed in the nuclei of keratinocytes located in all of the suprabasal layers of the interfollicular epidermis, whereas C/EBPβ is found in low amounts in some basal keratinocytes and strongly increases in the lower suprabasal layers (Fig. 1B; P1). In hair follicles, PPARβ and C/EBPs strictly colocalize in the developing sebaceous glands (Fig. 1; P4-P7), consistent with previous observations made in adult skin (16.Bull J.J. Muller-Rover S. Chronnell C.M. Paus R. Philpott M.P. McKay I.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and cultured sebocytes (20.Chen W. Yang C.C. Sheu H.M. Seltmann H. Zouboulis C.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Intense C/EBPα expression was also specifically detected in the nuclei of dermal papilla fibroblasts, from early hair follicle stages (P1) to mature follicles (P7), whereas C/EBPβ was found restricted to the outer root sheath keratinocytes. A weak staining of C/EBPβ was also observed in hair shaft precursors (precortex region) of differentiating hair follicles (Fig. 1B; P7). However, in contrast to PPARβ expression, neither C/EBPα nor C/EBPβ expression was detectable in the highly proliferative epithelial compartments of developing hair follicles, including hair peg (P1) and hair matrix (P4-P7) keratinocytes. Altogether, these results indicate that the expression of PPARβ and C/EBPs are mutually exclusive in mouse keratinocytes in the interfollicular epidermis as well as in the differentiating hair follicles, suggesting a negative interplay in keratinocytes between the two families of transcription factors during skin development. C/EBPs Modulate PPARβ Expression in Mouse Keratinocytes—To assess whether C/EBPs could directly modulate PPARβ expression in keratinocytes, mouse BALB/MK cells were transiently co-transfected with C/EBP-expressing vectors and a luciferase reporter construct containing the proximal promoter of the mouse PPARβ gene. This 1.88-kb PPARβ promoter region used herein was characterized in our laboratory. It contains sequences related to binding sites for AP-1, Ets, and C/EBP transcription factors (5.Tan N.S. Michalik L. Noy N. Yasmin R. Pacot C. Heim M. Fluhmann B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3263-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Overexpression in BALB/MK cells of either C/EBPα or C/EBPβ repressed basal PPARβ promoter activity by 2-3-fold in a dose-dependent manner, whereas expression of C/EBPδ had no significant effect (Fig. 2A). Consistent with these observations, transfection of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in mouse keratinocytes resulted in a decrease of endogenous PPARβ mRNA levels, as evaluated by real time PCR (Fig. 2B, left). In similar conditions, PPARγ expression was increased, with C/EBPα and C/EBPδ having a greater effect than C/EBPβ (Fig. 2B, right). As a control of the functionality of the transfected C/EBPs, we used the proximal murine promoter regions of the genes for keratin 10 (K10) and cyclooxygenase-2, which both contain multiple functional C/EBP-binding sites (13.Maytin E.V. Lin J.C. Krishnamurthy R. Batchvarova N. Ron D. Mitchell P.J. Habener J.F. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25.Kim Y. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27686-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As previously described in other cell types, a strong activation of the K10 promoter by both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ was observed in BALB/MK cells (Fig. 2C, left) (13.Maytin E.V. Lin J.C. Krishnamurthy R. Batchvarova N. Ron D. Mitchell P.J. Habener J.F. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the cyclooxygenase-2 promoter activity, in agreement with a previous report, was only increased by C/EBPδ (Fig. 2C, right) (25.Kim Y. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27686-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To further identify the region in the mouse PPARβ promoter that mediates the inhibition described above, the consequence of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ overexpression on the activity of a series of truncations of the proximal PPARβ promoter was analyzed in BALB/MK cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ still inhibited the activity of the promoter constructs PPARβ(-846) and PPARβ(-587). In contrast, the shorter promoter constructs PPARβ(-445) and PPARβ(-223) were not responsive to C/EBPα or C/EBPβ overexpression, suggesting that the region mediating inhibition by C/EBPs is located between nucleotides -587 and -445 of the PPARβ promoter. Sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of a putative C/EBP response element between nucleotides -494 and -485, as well as putative binding sites for Oct1 and AP-1 transcription factors (Fig. 3B). To determine whether C/EBP-mediated inhibition of PPARβ expression requires this newly identified C/EBP response element, we introduced mutations known to prevent recognition by C/EBP transcription factors (Fig. 3B) (11.Osada S. Yamamoto H. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Interestingly, disruption of the putative C/EBP response element in the PPARβ(-587) reporter construct totally abrogated the inhibitory effect of both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the action of these factors on the activity of the PPARβ promoter depends on the occupancy of the C/EBP response element at position -494/-495. C/EBPα and C/EBPβ Inhibit PPARβ Promoter Activity Independently of Their Repression Domains—C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are known to inhibit the promoter activity of a number of genes in various cell types, although the molecular mechanisms of this repression have not been explored (26.Sankpal N.V. Mayo M.W. Powell S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1728: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27.Steffensen K.R. Schuster G.U. Parini P. Holter E. Sadek C.M. Cassel T. Eskild W.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Intrinsic domains that negatively regulate transcriptional activity have been identified in C/EBPs (10.Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the inhibitory functions of these domains have been attributed to a repression of DNA binding, transcriptional activation, and synergy with factors bound to adjacent promoter elements. To determine the functional domains of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ required for inhibition of the PPARβ promoter activity, several C/EBP mutant proteins tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) were transiently overexpressed in BALB/MK keratinocytes (Fig. 4A). These mutants were deleted of the repression domain and/or of the activation domains or carried single point mutations (KE) in the DNA-binding basic region (23.Harris T.E. Albrecht J.H. Nakanishi M. Darlington G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29200-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that prevent binding of C/EBPs to DNA, as confirmed using ChIP assays on the K10 promoter (Fig. S1A). All C/EBP mutants were expressed at comparable protein levels when transiently transfected in mouse keratinocytes (Fig. 4B). As expected, they all have lost their ability to transactivate the K10 promoter (supplemental Fig. S1B), which requires both binding to specific DNA response elements and transactivation activity (13.Maytin E.V. Lin J.C. Krishnamurthy R. Batchvarova N. Ron D. Mitchell P.J. Habener J.F. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion that includes the repression domain of C/EBPα (C/EBPα-Δ1) did not prevent its ability to inhibit PPARβ promoter activity (Fig. 4A), suggesting that C/EBPα uses an alternative mechanism to repress PPARβ transcription. Most importantly, further deletion of the region up to amino acids 170-273 in the C/EBPα protein (C/EBPα-Δ2) or deletion of the corresponding region on C/EBPβ protein (amino acids 115-211, C/EBPβ-Δ2) abrogated the inhibitory effects of C/EBPs on the PPARβ promoter (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained by mutating the basic domain of C/EBPα (C/EBPα-KE) and C/EBPβ (C/EBPβ-KE), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of C/EBPs on PPARβ promoter requires both an internal domain spanning residues 17"

The C1s protease of the first complement component, the C1 complex, initiates the pathway. In this study we have elucidated the full specificity of the enzyme for the first time using a randomized phage display library. It was found that, aside from the crucial P1 position, the S3 and S2 subsites (in that order) played the greatest role in determining specificity. C1s prefers Leu or Val at P3 and Gly or Ala residues at P2. Apart from the S2′ position, which showed specificity for Leu, prime subsites did not greatly affect specificity. It was evident, however, that together they significantly contributed to the efficiency of cleavage of a peptide. A peptide substrate based on the top sequence obtained in the phage display validated these results and produced the best kinetics of any C1s substrate to date. The results allow an understanding of the active site specificity of the C1s protease for the first time and provide a basis for the development of specific inhibitors aimed at controlling inflammation associated with complement activation in adverse pathological situations.

Complement is an integral component of the adaptive and innate immune systems and represents one of the major effector systems for the immune response (1Janeway C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik M. Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. 5th Ed. Garland Publishing, New York2001: 43-64Google Scholar). However, inadvertent or unwanted complement activation can be harmful to the body (2Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); an example of this is the activation of the system during reperfusion injury after myocardial infarction (3Riedemann N.C. Ward P.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 363-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, the control of complement may also have an important bearing on preventing or attenuating certain inflammatory diseases. The complement system consists of a highly regulated cascade of proteolytic enzymes and other proteins (1Janeway C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik M. Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. 5th Ed. Garland Publishing, New York2001: 43-64Google Scholar), and it is suggested that control of the system could be achieved through the use of highly targeted inhibitors of the serine proteases (2Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In particular, the initiating proteases of the C1 complex of the classical pathway are of great relevance to such an approach since control of cascade systems is logically most efficiently achieved by shutting off the initiation steps. The C1 component is a complex of the binding protein C1q and two proenzymes, C1r and C1s (4Porter R.R. Reid K.B.M. Nature. 1978; 275: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Upon binding of IgG to the heads of C1q, C1r undergoes autoactivation to cleave and activate C1s. C1s appears to be a highly specific protease, cleaving the C4 and C2 components to instigate a sequence of activation steps of other components of the complement system, culminating in the formation of the membrane attack complex, which induces cell lysis (5Arlaud G.J. Colomb M.G. Gagnon J. Immunol. Today. 1987; 8: 106-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Schumaker V.N. Zavodszky P. Poon P.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1987; 5: 21-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The only other protein known to interact with C1s physiologically is the serpin, C1 inhibitor, which inhibits and, thus, controls the enzyme. Several studies have revealed that C1s is able to cleave substrates outside complement (7Busby Jr., W.H. Nam T.-J. Moralez A. Smith C. Jennings M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37638-37644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Yamaguchi K. Sakiyama H. Matsumoto M. Moriya H. Sakiyama S.

Dis. 1999; 58: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but the physiological relevance of these interactions remains to be understood. Understanding the substrate specificity of an enzyme is a prerequisite for the development of specific inhibitors and also allows insights into overall function. C1s is interesting in that it apparently only interacts with its major substrates (C2 and C4) and C1-inhibitor, which suggests that it is highly restricted in terms of its substrate specificity. Analysis of the crystal structure of the catalytic domain (CCP2-SP) of C1s demonstrated restricted access to subsidiary binding sites in the active site of the SP domain (12Gaboriaud C. Rossi V. Bally I. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), with two major insertions around the non-prime binding subsites 3The nomenclature for residues within the reactive site loop is based on that outlined by Schecter and Berger (22Schechter I. Berger A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar) for the substrates of proteases. The residues are numbered from the cleaved bond (P1-P1′) as follows: Pn-...-P4-P3-P2-P1-P1′-P2′-P3′-P4′-...-Pn′. 3The nomenclature for residues within the reactive site loop is based on that outlined by Schecter and Berger (22Schechter I.

The residues are numbered from the cleaved bond (P1-P1′) as follows: Pn-...-P4-P3-P2-P1-P1′-P2′-P3′-P4′-...-Pn′. being a predominant feature. These structural data suggest that the non-prime region may play a crucial role in governing C1s specificity. The activity of C1s against synthetic peptide substrates covering the non-prime side of substrates has been mapped to a limited extent, indicating that the enzyme is quite specific in this region (13Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14O'Brien G. Quinsey N.S. Whisstock J.C. Pike R.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14939-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15McRae B.J. Lin T.Y. Powers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12362-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The use of substrates based on the cleavage sequences of C4 and C2, the physiological substrates of human C1s, to investigate the kinetic parameters of the interaction of these substrates with the active site of the enzyme has previously been reported (14O'Brien G. Quinsey N.S. Whisstock J.C. Pike R.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14939-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated a dramatic increase in the affinity of C1s for substrates that contained prime side residues. However, a complete study of the specificity determinants of the enzyme has not been conducted, and the role of the non-prime side residues has not been fully investigated. Here, we employed a phage display library to determine the full specificity of the C1s protease. Our data reveal the first complete picture of C1s specificity, providing insights into this important enzymes selectivity for protein substrates. Materials—Fluorescent-quenched substrates (C2 P4-P4′ substrate (2Abz 4The abbreviations used are:Abz2-aminobenzoylLys(Dnp)lysine dinitrophenyl -SLGRKIQI-Lys(Dnp)-NH22), C4 P4-P4′ substrate (2Abz-GLQRALEI-Lys(Dnp)-NH2), C1-inhibitor P4-P4′ substrate (2Abz-SVARTLLV-Lys(Dnp)-NH2), and the peptide from phage display (2Abz-GYLGRSYKVG-Lys(Dnp)D-OH)) were synthesized at greater than 80% purity by Auspep (Melbourne, Vic., Australia). Metal-chelating Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Commercial PCR clean-up kits were purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). The PCR primers were generic primers based on the Novagen T7SelectUP and DOWN primers. BIG-DYE Version 3.1 was purchased from the Monash University Micromon DNA sequencing facility. Human C1s (activated two chain) was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and made up to 1 mg/ml using sterile laboratory grade water. 2-aminobenzoyl lysine dinitrophenyl Assay of Cleavage of Peptide Substrates—Assays were carried out in fluorescent assay buffer (0.05 M Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) at 37 °C using final substrate concentrations in the range from 0.5 to 20 μm substrate. Generally, C1s was used at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. The rate of increase of fluorescence for the assays was measured on a BMG Technologies FluoStar Galaxy fluorescent plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm and an emission wavelength of 420 nm. The initial reaction rate was estimated at a single concentration of enzyme from duplicate measurements over a range of substrate concentrations. To determine steady-state reaction constants (Vmax, K0.5, and h (Hill coefficient)), the experimental results were fitted using the GraphPad Prism Version 3.0 computer program to an equation describing positive cooperativity (V = Vmax[S]h/[S] h + K0.5h), which defines the relationship between reaction rate and substrate concentration when more than one binding site applies (as described in O'Brien et al. (14O'Brien G. Quinsey N.S. Whisstock J.C. Pike R.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14939-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)). The kcat values were calculated as described previously (14O'Brien G. Quinsey N.S. Whisstock J.C. Pike R.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14939-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Phage Display—The T7Select1-1b Phage Display system (Novagen) was used to generate a randomized protease substrate library 5A. Matthews and P. Bird, manuscript in preparation. following the approach of Cwirla et al. (16Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The library was generated by synthesizing a degenerate oligonucleotide, annealing it to two complementary half-site oligonucleotides, ligating the resulting heteroduplex to T7Select1-1b vector arms, and adding to a T7 phage packaging extract. The degenerate oligonucleotides had the following sequence: 5′-AATTCTCTCACTCCAGGCGGC(NNK)4CGY(NNK)4CATCACCATCACCATCACA-3′ (where N represents any nucleotide and K represents T/C). The half-site oligonucleotides were 5′-GCCGCCTGGAGTGAGAG-3′ and 5′-AGCTTACTGATGCTGATGCTGATG-3′. This adds a randomized octameric peptide, interrupted by a central arginine, and a hexahistidine tag to the C terminus of the 10B coat protein. The titer of this fixed arginine library was 8.1 × 105 plaque-forming units. This was amplified to yield a library of 2.8 × 1010 plaque-forming units. About 109 plaque-forming units of amplified phage in phage extraction buffer were bound to nickel-chelated Sepharose beads at 4 °C. Unbound phage were removed by washing the beads with phage wash buffer (850 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline). After 2 washes in 1 mm MgSO4 in phosphate-buffered saline, the bead/phage suspension was divided into two 500-μl aliquots in the same buffer (control and treatment). The phage selection commenced by the addition of 200 nm C1s protease to the treatment tube. Both the treated and control beads were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cleaved phage were recovered from the supernatant, titrated, and amplified to form the sub-library for the next round of selection. Phage that remained bound to the beads were eluted with 0.5 m imidazole and titrated to assess cleavage efficiency. After the indicated rounds, 96 individual phage plaques were randomly selected for sequencing. The phage DNA was amplified by PCR using the T7 SelectUP and DOWN primers (T7Select cloning kit, Novagen). Sequencing of PCR products employing the same primers was carried out using the Big Dye 3.1 kit (Amersham Biosciences). Verification of C1s Protease Specificity in an Optimal Phage Display Peptide Library—An optimal phage display peptide library consisting of phage expressing eight known peptide sequences was constructed to form the starting library for a further phage selection experiment. The following peptide sequences were selected and combined in equal proportions to form the optimal library: FGGSLKLS, TLQR-RSEQ, YVGR-LLRG, AMYR-VEWL, YLGR-SYKV, ALFR-APRA, SLIRKARA, and YLGR-IGVY. The library was diluted so that it had a titer of ∼109 phage/ml. Phage selection by protease digestion then commenced as described previously. In total, four rounds of selection were completed. Determination of C1s Substrate Recognition Profile by Phage Selection—The C terminus of the T7 phage capsid protein was manipulated to contain a randomized peptide of nine amino acids, with the exception of a fixed arginine at the central (putative P1) position. The P5 position of the nonamer was considered to be a spacer in this study due to its close proximity to the T7 phage body. As a result, the data corresponding to the P5 residues of the phage peptides were not analyzed. The nine-amino acid insert is followed by a hexahistidine tag, which serves to anchor the phage to a matrix, in this case nickel-chelating Sepharose beads. The C1s protease is able to cleave the peptides of susceptible phage, releasing the phage from the beads. The cleaved phage were subsequently collected and amplified. A control experiment in which no protease was added was used as a reference to determine the background level of phage dissociation from the matrix without protease treatment. After each round of protease digestion, a titration was performed to determine the number of released phage from each eluted sample for both the protease-treated and control experiments. The addition of C1s to amplified sub-libraries at selection rounds five and seven gave 12.8- and 14.5-fold greater release of phage than the control library, respectively, the highest obtained across the selection rounds carried out. 288 phage were selected for sequencing from selection rounds 5 and 7. Results from each round were very similar, and therefore, the sequences obtained from each round were considered in one analysis. In total, 219 readable sequences were obtained, comprising 93 different peptide sequences. The predominant phage peptide sequence was YLGRSYKV at 40% (Fig. 1). A total of 33 peptide sequences occurred more than once, and 8 occurred at least 3 times. Because the prevalence of the repeated phage peptides was likely to skew the amino acid trends at each position, the 93 different phage peptide sequences were analyzed (Fig. 2). The sequences were aligned around the arginine at the putative P1 due to its fixed position in this library and the fact that C1s is known to only accept an arginine residue at the P1 position of substrates (17O'Brien G. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Monash University, Clayton, Australia2003: 240Google Scholar). Leucine was found at P3 with a frequency greater than that found for any amino acid at any position from P4-P4′, suggesting that S3 is the most selective subsite in C1s (Fig. 2). Glycine and valine also occurred at frequencies greater than 10% at this position. The S2 subsite accepts small amino acids, with Gly and Ala being the most predominant amino acids found at the P2 position (Fig. 2). The frequency of occurrence of Gly at P2 is second only to the frequency for Leu at P3 across all of the results. Tyr, Ser, and Ala were the most preferred amino acids at the P4 position (Fig. 2). In contrast to the strong amino acid preferences seen on the non-prime side of the cleavage site, the prime side shows less selectivity, with the exception of the P2′ position where leucine was clearly most preferred residue and occurred with the third highest frequency of any amino acid at any position (Fig. 2). Overall, at P1′ hydrophobic amino acids (Leu, Val, Ala) were favored, but Ser was the most preferred residue. There was a preference for Arg, Val, Leu, and Gly residues at the P3′ position, whereas the S4′ subsite showed relatively little specificity but had preferences of Val > Leu = Ala > Arg (Fig. 2). Ranking the C1s Phage Substrates—The simplest interpretation of the results shown in Fig. 1 is that the frequency at which a particular phage appears is directly proportional to the efficiency of its cleavage by C1s. Thus, YLGRSYKV would represent the best C1s substrate retrieved from the library. Alternatively, other factors, such as uneven amplification, may lead to over-representation of a particular phage in the selection process. To distinguish between these possibilities, we constructed a second library consisting of a mixture of equal numbers of the six most frequently occurring sequences from the first library plus two sequences that were only represented once and, therefore, were considered to be controls to reflect more poorly selected sequences. Ninety-six individual phage plaques were sequenced from round three of selection, which had the highest -fold difference between control and treated phage samples, yielding a total of 94 readable sequences. The results of this experiment verified that YLGRSYKV was the best of the sequences (58% occurrence) followed by the YLGRIGVY peptide (17% occurrence), ALFRAPRA (14% occurrence), YVGRLLRG (6% occurrence), TLQRRSEQ (4% occurrence), and SLIRKARA (1% occurrence). The FGGSLKLS peptide, which did not contain the fixed arginine at P1, and AMYRVEWL were not observed, suggesting that they are not readily cleaved by the protease. Validation of Phage Display Results Using a Synthetic Peptide Substrate—To confirm that the sequences obtained from the phage display analysis are optimal C1s substrates, a synthetic peptide substrate based on the YLGRSYKV sequence was synthesized commercially. The kinetic parameters for C1s-mediated cleavage of this peptide, 2Abz-GYLGRSYKVG-Lys(Dnp)D-OH, were determined in comparison to the physiological cleavage sequences, C2, C4, and C1-inhibitor. For all of the substrates analyzed, the dependence of the initial velocity on substrate concentration was best fitted to a sigmoidal curve fit, as found previously for the C2 and C4 substrates (14O'Brien G. Quinsey N.S. Whisstock J.C. Pike R.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14939-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This analysis represents a simplistic analysis of potentially complex non-Michaelis-Menten behavior by the enzyme for which the physical basis is not completely understood at present. The values for kcat/K0.5 for hydrolysis of the substrates shown in TABLE ONE allow us to simply rank the efficiency of cleavage of the phage substrate in relation to physiological cleavage sequences, however. The phage substrate showed a 4.7-fold higher kcat/K0.5 value than the C2 substrate. The C4 and C1 inhibitor substrates had ∼6- and 21-fold lower kcat/K0.5 values, respectively, than the phagederived substrate.TABLE ONEKinetic constants for the proteolytic activity of C1s on a synthetic substrate based on the most abundant peptide sequence from phage display and its comparison with three substrates based on the cleavage sequences in the physiological complement proteins C2, C4, and C1 inhibitor (C1-I) (P4-P4′)SubstrateaP4—P4′ substrate sequences are given in each case; for full details of each substrate, please see “Experimental Procedures.”kcat/K0.5mm/sPhage substrate, YLGR-SYKV12.0C2 substrate, SLGR-KIQI2.55C4 substrate, GLQR-ALEI2.06C1-I substrate, SVAR-TLLV0.57a P4—P4′ substrate sequences are given in each case; for full details of each substrate, please see “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Overall Evaluation of C1s Specificity in Relation to Physiological Cleavage Sequences—The results of this study strongly suggest that the non-prime side subsites of C1s are more selective than the prime side subsites. The S3 position was easily the most selective of the seven positions, with a very strong preference for Leu and, to a lesser extent, Val and Gly residues (Fig. 2). Leucine is found at both the C2 and C4 P3 positions, whereas Val is found at this position in the C1 inhibitor cleavage sequence (TABLE ONE). The S2 subsite was the next most selective, with a strong preference for Gly and, to a lesser extent, Ala, evident. These results gelled with physiological sequences where both Gly and Ala residues are present in the C2 and C1 inhibitor sequences, respectively. It is notable that Gln, found at the P2 position in the C4 sequence, was not found at high frequency at all; thus, there are evidently other factors involved in the cleavage of the C4 protein versus the C2 substrate and C1 inhibitor sequences. The S4 position favored Tyr, Ser, and Ala residues. It is interesting to note that serine is found in two physiological sequences, C2 and C1 inhibitor, whereas Gly is the residue found at this position in C4. Once again, the residue found at the C4 P4 position is not among the most preferred (above 10), although in this case Gly was at least one of the better preferred residues among those found below a frequency of 10. Studies by O'Brien et al. (14O'Brien G. Quinsey N.S. Whisstock J.C. Pike R.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14939-14945Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) indicated that interaction with the prime side substrate residues enhanced the affinity of C1s for its C2 and C4 substrates. From the data presented here, C1s displayed quite high specificity for leucine at the P2′ position, but other prime side sites did not individually affect specificity markedly. The frequency of occurrence of Leu at P2′ ranked next after the Leu at P3 and Gly at P2, indicating that it does influence specificity to a significant extent. Leucine is found in both C1 inhibitor and C4 cleavage sequences at P2′. The Ile found at this position on C2 was a regularly found amino acid in the data analyzed here. The next highest preference in the prime positions was at the P1′ position, with Ser, Ala, Leu, and Val residues occurring most frequently. Of the residues found in physiological cleavage sequences, only Ala, found at P1′ in C4, was among the better residues. At the P3′ position the most significant preferences were Arg, Leu, and Val, of which only the Leu is found in the C1 inhibitor sequence. At the P4′ position, valine, found in the C1 inhibitor sequence, was the most frequently found residue. Isoleucine is found at this position in both the C4 and C2 sequences but was only found five times. Analysis in the Context of the C1s Crystal Structure—Analysis of the crystal structure of the C1s catalytic fragment, representing the CCP2-SP domains, has revealed that access to the non-prime binding sites in the vicinity of the active site in particular is restricted (12Gaboriaud C. Rossi V. Bally I. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This was particularly evident at the S2 position, where a major insertion loop is positioned over the active site and the Phe-511 residue in particular restricts access to this site. This provides a good explanation for the observed strong preference for small amino acids, such as Gly and Ala, at the P2 position in substrates. Because no inhibitor was docked into the active site in the crystal structure, further analysis of the subsites required the docking of a substrate/inhibitor sequence into the active site of the protease, performed essentially as described previously (18Quinsey N.S. Whisstock J.C. Le Bonniec B. Louvain V. Bottomley S.P. Pike R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15971-15978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This allowed analysis of the S3 site in particular, which our results show to be the most selective of all the sites aside from the S1 site. As shown in Fig. 3, the S3 pocket is hydrophobic but relatively shallow. The “walls” of the pocket consist of Phe-511, Tyr-595, Trp-640, and Pro-642, whereas Phe-597 acts as the “floor.” Leu and Val residues, preferred at the P3 position in substrates, therefore qualify for binding to this site from the point of view of being hydrophobic and also small enough to be accommodated by the shallow subsite. In contrast to the high degree of selectivity seen on the non-prime side, the prime side was found to have a relatively small degree of substrate selectivity. This is partly attributable to the prime binding sites being comparatively more open than the non-prime binding sites, as shown in Fig. 3. Significance of the Results—Having elucidated the most important determinants of specificity for the active site of the C1s protease, we asked whether the active site of C1s contained all of the information required to explain its apparently high selectivity for substrates in vivo. Certainly it appears that the C2 and C1 inhibitor cleavage sequences are a good fit with the active site of the enzyme. The interaction with residues at the cleavage site of C4 was less appropriate, particularly at the important P2 position. This would seem to indicate that other sites on the substrate might interact with the enzyme to facilitate proper cleavage of the substrate, and indeed it has been shown that C4 interacts with the CCP domains of the C1s substrate to facilitate proper cleavage (19Rossi V. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Esser A.F. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1232-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We also considered whether the substrate selectivity of C1s gave any clues as to whether the enzyme was as selective for protein substrates as suggested by the limited range of substrates found mainly within the complement pathway. We constructed a model (available at pops.csse.monash.edu.au) for its substrate selectivity within the Prediction of Protease Specificity (PoPS) (20Boyd S.E. Pike R.N. Rudy G.B. Whisstock J.C. Garcia de la Banda M. J. Bioinform. Comput. B. 2005; 3: 551-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) computer program and used this program to scan the human proteome for substrates that matched the selectivity criteria for C1s cleavage. It should be noted here that the active site specificity of the protease is just one factor contributing to the likelihood that a substrate will be cleaved at a particular position by a protease, albeit an important factor given that it always constitutes one of the premier zones of interaction with a substrate. Other factors include positioning by exosites, the structure of the substrate, and the location (e.g. intracellular versus extracellular) of substrates relative to the enzyme. The model constructed in PoPS performed well in control analyses on the physiological substrates, particularly in the case of C2, where it correctly identified the correct cleavage site with a score of 47. For C1 inhibitor, an alternative cleavage site was predicted with a score of 43.5, whereas the authentic site scored next highest at 40. The “incorrect” predicted cleavage site for C1 inhibitor is sited at a position that would be predicted to be occluded behind the F α-helix of the serpin, and therefore, it appears that in this instance it is the structure of the inhibitor that dictates correct cleavage along with the specificity of the active site. For C4, the physiological cleavage site had the second highest score of 44, with the highest score being 49 for an alternative cleavage site. It appears that in this instance the correct cleavage might be dictated by positioning via the proposed exosite on C1s for the C4 substrate (19Rossi V. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Esser A.F. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1232-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), following which the active site selects the actual site of cleavage. We then used the PoPS model to predict the cleavage sites for C1s in previously identified substrates outside of the complement pathway. It must be noted that the cleavage sites for C1s in these proteins have not yet been identified. The model predicted cleavage after Arg-83 in insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (7Busby Jr., W.H. Nam T.-J. Moralez A. Smith C. Jennings M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37638-37644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (score of 44.3) and after Arg-107 (10Eriksson H. Nissen M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1037: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in the major histocompatibility complex class I protein (score of 43.2). It remains to be established whether the proteins are cleaved at the positions predicted by PoPS. Overall, the model produced a large number of matches within the human proteome. In comparison to the three physiological substrates and two known substrates, with scores in the 40 s, the highest score overall was 63 for the Pleckstrin homology domain containing family A, member 4 protein. This top ranked protein is most likely intracellular, meaning that it is unlikely to encounter C1s physiologically. This is similar for many of the proteins that had cleavage sites with higher scores (>50); thus, location can be used to eliminate a large number of the candidate substrates we identified in the proteome search. We also identified potential substrates (with scores over 50) that might be important in inflammatory conditions, with the Fc receptor-like protein 3, which is associated with autoimmune thyroid disease and systemic lupus erythematosus (21Kochi Y. Yamada R. Suzuki A. Harley J.B. Shirasawa S. Sawada T. Bae S.C. Tokuhiro S. Chang X. Sekine A. Takahashi A. Tsunoda T. Ohnishi Y. Kaufman K.M. Kang C.P. Kang C. Otsubo S. Yumura W. Mimori A. Koike T. Nakamura Y. Sasazuki T. Yamamoto K. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), standing out as a promising candidate for further investigation. Overall, the analysis with PoPS suggests that C1s activity may not be restricted to interaction with C2, C4, and C1 inhibitor in vivo, and certainly analysis of the cleavage of predicted substrates will constitute a major goal of ours in future studies. The results of this study indicate that it should certainly be possible to target the active site of C1s, with the S3-S1 subsites as the major focus of attack, to inhibit this enzyme and suppress the effects of the complement pathway in inflammatory diseases."

However, the role of DNA methylation in transcriptional activation remains a mystery. In particular, it is not known whether the transcriptional activation of methylated DNA is promoter-specific, depends directly on sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, or is facilitated by the methylation. Here we report that the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, RFX, previously shown to mediate the transition from an inactive to an active chromatin structure, activates a methylated promoter. RFX is capable of mediating enhanceosome formation on a methylated promoter, thereby mediating a transition from a methylation-dependent repression of the promoter to a methylation-dependent activation of the promoter.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mechanism of these effects is unknown, and no DNA-binding proteins involved in these processes have been identified. Other studies have indicated that methylated DNA can be transcribed, presumably when there is an absence of proteins that directly mediate transcriptional repression (11Warnecke P.M. Clark S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 164-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of these studies involve a transition from repressed to activated methylated DNA. Recently, Lembo et al. (12Lembo F.

However, the molecular mechanism that specifies a transition from repressed methylated DNA to methylated DNA that becomes or remains transcriptionally active, for a given promoter, remains unknown. Here we report that the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, RFX, can mediate the transcriptional activation of a methylated major histocompatibility (MHC) gene promoter that was repressed by the methylation. These results indicate that DNA demethylation is not necessary for promoter de-repression, i.e. for a loss of proteins that block the binding of positive transcriptional regulatory proteins; and that DNA demethylation is not necessary for promoter activation, defined as an initial promoter-protein interaction that facilitates the interaction of the promoter with positive transcriptional regulatory proteins. Azacytidine Treatments and Agarose Gel PCR—Suspension B-cell lines (Raji, 6.1.6., and BLS1) were seeded at 105 cells per ml in a 20-ml volume of media. Cells were treated with 5 μm azacytidine for 72 h. Total RNA was prepared as described (13Blanck G. Lok M. Kok K. Downie E. Korn J.H. Strominger J.L. Hum.

Mock methylated pDRA was prepared in the same way but without SssI methylase in the reaction. Methylated pDRA, or mock methylated DNA, was extracted with phenol:chloroform, ethanol precipitated, resuspended in water, and quantified by absorbance at A260 and agarose gel electorphoresis. Methylation was confirmed by treatment of the methylated and mock methylated pDRA with a methylation sensitive restriction enzyme. Fifty nanograms of methylated pDRA were added to each of six wells containing 5 × 104 5637 cells (ATCC). DNA transfection was performed using the TransIT Reagent according to the vendor's instructions. IFN-γ was added to 400 units/ml following the transfection, and luciferase assays were performed 24 h following the transfection. Each bar graph represents the average and standard deviations for six transfections. Co-transfections of RFX Expression Vectors and the HLA-DRA Promoter-Luciferase Construct—Fifty ng of methylated pDRA (Me-pDRA) was co-transfected with 50 ng each of cytomegalovirus-based expression vectors for RFX5, RFXAP, and RFXB (also termed RFXANK or Tvl-1), representing the RFX trimer, or with 150 ng of empty expression vector, into 5 × 104 5637 cells, as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Following the transfection, cells were treated with IFN-γ. Luciferase averages and p values were obtained by using six wells for each transfection. Quantification of the luciferase assay is indicated to the left of the bar graphs and the p value is indicated in boxes. Methylation Sensitive Real-time PCR—Twenty-four hours following transfection of the indicated plasmids, total cellular DNA was isolated. Cells from a 100-mm plate were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in SDS buffer, and the DNA was sheared by passage of the cell lysate through a 20-gauge syringe exactly 10 times. The cell lysate was incubated with proteinase K and RNase, and DNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform using standard procedures for isolating cellular DNA. The DNA was ethanol precipitated, resuspended in water, and quantified. Equal amounts of DNA (about 1% of the DNA recovered from a 100-mm plate) were digested with the indicated methylation sensitive restriction enzymes and were amplified by real-time PCR using a Bio-Rad icycler and Bio-Rad iQ SYBR Green Supermix, according to the vendor's instructions.

Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature; the cells were harvested and lysates were prepared. The His tag (27E8) monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were analyzed for the presence His-tagged RFX on the HLA-DRA promoter. Rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody was used as the control for all reactions. The PCR were then performed using 2.5 μl of the DNA from the immunoprecipitation reactions or 1 μl of DNA from the input reaction as template. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; then 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 43 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 30 s; followed by 68 °C for 2 min.

For example, Drosophila RFX functions in sperm (29Vandaele C. Coulon-Bublex M. Couble P. Durand B. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and RFX2 and RFX4 function in the testis (30Horvath G.C. Kistler W.S. Kistler M.K. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 836-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). B-cells specifically lacking RFX, but possessing the other required transactivators, do not have a transcriptionally active HLA-DRA gene, the human MHC class II gene prototype for the study of MHC class II gene regulation. RFX-defective B-cells have a condensed, inaccessible HLA-DRA promoter chromatin conformation. To determine whether DNA methylation plays a role in preventing transcription of HLA-DRA in RFX-negative cells, we treated two RFX-negative cell lines with azacytidine, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase activity, and assayed the cells for HLA-DRA mRNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 1A). Azacytidine treatment led to an increase in HLA-DRA mRNA production compared with untreated cells. As expected, this increase did not lead to mRNA levels seen in RFX-positive B-cells because the azacytidine does not rescue the enhanceosome function of RFX. However, these results are consistent with the possibility that RFX-negative cells have a methylated HLA-DRA gene (see also Fig. 5). To determine whether an HLA-DRA promoter-reporter construct could be repressed by methylation, we methylated a previously described (14Osborne A. Zhang H. Yang W.M. Seto E. Blanck G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6495-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) pDRA (luciferase) construct with SssI methylase, which methylates all plasmid CpG dinucleotides. The methylated pDRA was transfected into 5637 cells, which require IFN-γ treatment for the induction of CIITA and the activation of the pDRA promoter. The SssI methylation significantly reduced the IFN-γ activation of the pDRA (Fig. 1B). RFX Facilitates Activation of a Methylated HLA-DRA Promoter-Reporter Construct—Methylated pDRA was co-transfected into 5637 cells with equal amounts of either (a) empty vector or (b) the RFXAP, RFXB, and RFX5 expression vectors, representing the three subunits of RFX. Cells were treated with IFN-γ and assayed for luciferase activity 24 h following the transfection. The methylated pDRA co-transfected with RFX showed a 10-fold increase (Fig. 2A) in luciferase activity compared with the control samples lacking the exogenously expressed RFX. To be certain that the increase in transcriptional activity was caused by RFX binding to the HLA-DRA promoter sequences of pDRA, we assessed the effect of RFX on pGL3 promoter-reporter constructs lacking any known RFX sites or lacking any apparent sites for the other sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins of the MHC class II enhanceosome. We methylated the pGL3-Basic and pGL3-Control luciferase constructs and transfected them into cells. pGL3-Basic, lacking any known promoter elements, had very little activity whether methylated or unmethylated (data not shown). Methylation of the pGL3-Control luciferase construct, which contains the SV40 enhancer, reduced its promoter activity (data not shown). The methylated pGL3-Control luciferase construct was then co-transfected into cells with the RFXAP, RFXB, and RFX5 expression vectors or with empty vector. No increase in transcriptional activity was observed for the pGL3-Control luciferase construct (Fig. 2B), consistent with the conclusion that RFX activates methylated pDRA by binding to its cognate site in the HLA-DRA promoter (Fig. 4E). Methylated pDRA co-transfected with the RFX expression vectors represented a positive control for the RFX effect (data not shown). RFX Is Required for the CIITA Activation of Methylated pDRA—In general, the sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins can occupy the HLA-DRA promoter without the advent of HLA-DRA transcription. Transcriptional activation commences when the formation of the enhanceosome, including RFX, is completed by availability and the enhanceosome binding of CIITA, which in turn leads to the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase activity (32Beresford G.W. Boss J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33Raval A. Howcroft T.K. Weissman J.D. Kirshner S. Zhu X.S. Yokoyama K. Ting J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CIITA synthesis is induced by IFN-γ, as a result of the IFN-γ induction of activated STAT1 and IRF-1 and the binding of these two transactivators to the CIITA promoter (34Steimle V. Otten L.A. Zufferey M. Mach B. Cell. 1993; 75: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 35Muhlthaler-Mottet A. Di Berardino W. Otten L. Mach B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To be certain that RFX facilitated the IFN-γ activation of the methylated pDRA promoter by cooperating with CIITA, rather than by any unappreciated indirect effect, we co-transfected the methylated pDRA with a CIITA expression vector and with either the RFX expression vectors or with control empty vector. RFX expression strongly enhanced the CIITA activation of the methylated pDRA (Fig. 3). RFX Does Not Facilitate the Activation of Nonmethylated pDRA and Does Not Facilitate Demethylation of pDRA—Whereas RFX is capable of low affinity binding to nonmethylated HLA-DRA promoter DNA and of participating in enhanceosome formation in vitro in the absence of DNA methylation, it is not known whether RFX is important in the activation of nonmethylated HLA-DRA promoter DNA. We co-transfected either the RFX expression vectors or empty vector with nonmethylated pDRA (Fig. 4, A–C), which led to a decrease in CIITA-dependent, HLA-DRA promoter activity. This result may indicate that another protein, rather than RFX, mediates the function of the X1 HLA-DRA promoter element, which includes the RFX binding site on nonmethylated DNA (Fig. 4E) (36Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Peterlin B.M. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the 5637 cells may not support a post-translational modification of RFX required for activation of an unmethylated promoter or may represent some other cell-specific effect that interferes with the activation of the nonmethylated HLA-DRA promoter-reporter construct. To rule out the possibility that RFX facilitated demethylation of the pDRA, we recovered total DNA from cells co-transfected with either the RFX expression vectors or the empty vector in combination with either methylated pDRA or nonmethylated pDRA. The recovered DNA was digested with either HgaI, the site for which overlaps the CG dinucleotide immediately adjacent to the X1 element in the HLA-DRA promoter (Fig. 4E), or with AvaI. Neither HgaI nor AvaI cleave DNA when the C at the cleavage site is methylated. The digested DNA was then assayed by real-time PCR using pDRA-specific primers on either side of the pDRA promoter HgaI site or luciferase coding sequence primers on either side of an AvaI site located in the luciferase coding region (Fig. 4D). The methylation sensitive PCR results indicated that nonmethylated DNA was significantly more sensitive than the methylated DNA to both of the restriction enzymes. Furthermore, the results indicated that RFX expression did not lead to an increase in the restriction enzyme sensitivity of the methylated DNA (i.e. did not lead to an increase in DNA demethylation) compared with the empty vector (Fig. 4, F–I). Thus, the activation of the methylated pDRA by RFX (Figs. 2 and 3) cannot be explained by RFX-mediated DNA demethylation. Interestingly, the results of the methylation sensitive PCR also indicated that RFX expression stabilized the methylation of the C in the HgaI-CpG dinucleotide that is adjacent to the RFX binding site on nonmethylated DNA (Fig. 4, D and E). RFX expression had no apparent effect on the durability of the methylation of the C in the AvaI site distal to the RFX binding site (Fig. 4, F–I). These results, coupled with the knowledge that RFX5 is a member of a methyl-DNA binding family of proteins, suggest that the HgaI site C, adjacent to but not included in the RFX contact points in nonmethylated DNA (37Westerheide S.D. Boss J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), contacts RFX in methylated DNA. RFX-defective B-cells Have a Reduced Capacity to Activate Methylated pDRA—To determine whether the absence of endogenous RFX would limit the activation of methylated pDRA, we transfected methylated and mock methylated pDRA into T5-1 cells, expressing wild-type RFX, and into a T5-1-derived, chemically mutated subclone, 6.1.6, which lacks the RFXAP subunit of the RFX trimer (38Durand B. Sperisen P. Emery P. Barras E. Zufferey M. Mach B. Reith W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1045-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and consequently has no RFX DNA binding activity. 6.1.6 does not express the MHC class II genes, including the HLA-DRA gene. This experiment revealed that methylation of pDRA caused an approximate 50% reduction in pDRA activity in T5-1 (Fig. 5A) but an 80% reduction in activity in 6.1.6 (Fig. 5B), consistent with a role for endogenous RFX in activating the methylated HLA-DRA promoter. RFX-defective B-cells Have a Methylated CpG Immediately Adjacent to the Canonical RFX-binding Site—To determine whether the cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide immediately 3′ of the canonical RFX binding site (Fig. 4E) is methylated in the endogenous promoter, in cells lacking RFX, we employed MS-PCR and bisulfite sequencing analysis. For both approaches, endogenous DNA was prepared from T5-1 B-cells, 6.1.6 B-cells, and SJO B-cells, which lack RFX5 (39Reith W. Mach B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 331-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and thus have no RFX DNA binding activity. SJO cells were derived from a bare lymphocyte syndrome patient, and SJO cells do not express any of the MHC class II genes. MS-PCR was performed with T5-1 and 6.1.6 DNA (Fig. 5C). In this analysis, the T5-1 DNA was more sensitive to HgaI digestion than was the DNA from 6.1.6 (Fig. 5C) or the DNA from SJO cells (data not shown). To verify and extend the MS-PCR analysis, we conducted a bisulfite sequencing analysis of the T5-1, 6.1.6, and SJO DNA. In this analysis, unmethylated C residues are converted to uracil as a result of the bisulfite treatment. (The uracil is converted to thymidine during the subsequent PCR step.) Whereas the C residue immediately 3′ of the canonical RFX binding site was converted to a T residue in T5-1, the C residues in 6.1.6 and SJO, respectively, were not converted to T residues (Fig. 5D). RFX Binds to Methylated pDRA—To examine whether RFX can bind to methylated DNA in vivo, we transfected 5637 cells with the His-tagged RFX expression vectors along with the methylated or unmethylated pDRA luciferase construct (Fig. 4D). Extracts were prepared and exogenous RFX was immunoprecipitated with an anti-His tag antibody and its association with the HLA-DRA promoter assayed by PCR with proximal primers (primers a and b in Fig. 4D). The promoter fragment could not be detected in cells transfected with the RFX or pDRA alone (Fig. 6). Similarly, there was no fragment in extracts representing RFX co-transfected with the unmethylated pDRA promoter. A band corresponding to the promoter was detected in cells transfected with RFX and methylated pDRA (Fig. 6). There was a comparable amount of the promoter in the input lanes, showing that the transfection efficiency was similar in all the samples. Taken together, these results indicate that RFX can indeed bind preferentially to the methylated HLA-DRA promoter sequences. Because RFX does not facilitate the CIITA activation of nonmethylated DNA or an increase in pDRA demethylation (Fig. 4), the RFX activation of methylated pDRA must be because of RFX binding to methylated pDRA and to the RFX-mediated recruitment of CIITA to the methylated pDRA (Figs. 6 and 8, A and B). These results represent the first description of a molecular mechanism indicating how a specific, methylated promoter can transition from a repressed to an activated state. Most importantly, the process of RFX-mediated enhanceosome formation on the methylated HLA-DRA promoter indicates that the transition from methylated, repressed DNA to methylated, activated DNA does not require a nonspecific transition or demethylation over long regions of heterochromatin. The Oct-1/YY-1 Repression Mechanism Does Not Function to Repress Either Inactive or Transcriptionally Competent Methylated pDRA—We have previously reported that both Oct-1 and YY-1 repress the IFN-γ activation of pDRA (14Osborne A. Zhang H. Yang W.M. Seto E. Blanck G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6495-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Zhang H. Shepherd A.T. Eason D.D. Wei S. Diaz J.I. Djeu J.Y. Wu G.D. Blanck G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 28911-28919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To determine whether this mechanism(s) functions to repress methylated pDRA, we transfected methylated pDRA or the previously described (14Osborne A. Zhang H. Yang W.M. Seto E. Blanck G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6495-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Zhang H. Shepherd A.T. Eason D.D. Wei S. Diaz J.I. Djeu J.Y. Wu G.D. Blanck G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 457-465PubMed Google Scholar, 41Osborne A.R. Zhang H. Fejer G. Palubin K.M. Niesen M.I. Blanck G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28911-28919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), methylated pDRAΔOct or methylated pDRAΔYY1 into IFN-γ-treated 5637 cells. The latter two pDRA luciferase constructs lack the Oct-1 and YY1 binding sites, respectively. We also transfected nonmethylated pDRA or pDRAΔOct or pDRAΔYY1 into IFN-γ-treated 5637 cells, a transfection series that serves as a positive control for the detection of Oct-1- or YY1-mediated repression. Results indicate that the nonmethylated DNA is repressed by Oct-1 and YY1, exactly as previously and extensively reported (Fig. 7A). The repression is revealed by an increase in luciferase activity when comparing the activity of either pDRAΔOct or pDRAΔYY1 to pDRA. However, the lack of these sites does not lead to increased activity when pDRA is methylated, with or without exogenous RFX expression (Fig. 7B). The data above indicate for the first time that a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein can facilitate enhanceosome formation on, and transcriptional activation of methylated promoter DNA; that a highly localized, sequence-specific transition from repressed methylated DNA to transcriptionally active DNA is possible; that RFX facilitates activation of a methylated HLA-DRA promoter; and that function of the Oct-1 and YY1 repression mechanisms requires demethylated DNA. The RFX transactivator may lead to methylated DNA promoter activation by either displacing or preventing the binding of MBD proteins that form a repressosome complex (Fig. 8, A and B). A direct role for DNA methylation in the function of RFX may be possible because (i) the RFX5 subunit of RFX belongs to a family of methyl-DNA-binding proteins; (ii) C residue methylation is known not to inhibit the binding of RFX5 to a collagen gene promoter (28Sengupta P.K. Fargo J. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24926-24937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); and (iii) RFX protects the methylation of the C residue immediately adjacent to its previously described HLA-DRA promoter binding site (Fig. 4, E–G). The contact points of RFX on methylated DNA are unknown, however, RFX does not contact the C residue of the HLA-DRA X2 element when the promoter is not methylated (37Westerheide S.D. Boss J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Alternatively, RFX may activate a methylated promoter because the methylated promoter is in nucleosomal form. RFX has a higher affinity for nucleosomes compared with naked DNA (42Caretti G. Cocchiarella F. Sidoli C. Villard J. Peretti M. Reith W. Mantovani R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and as noted in the Introduction, DNA methylation leads to the formation of deacetylated nucleosomes. Either RFX-mediated displacement of repressive MBD proteins (Fig. 8, A and B), or RFX affinity for nucleosomes could be consistent with the well established cooperativity of the HLA-DRA promoter-binding proteins. For example, the displacement of an MBD repressive complex, or binding to nucleosomes may require the cooperative assembly of the RFX-CREB-NF-Y enhanceosome (17Villard J. Peretti M. Masternak K. Barras E. Caretti G. Mantovani R. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3364-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Scholl T. Mahanta S.K. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the cooperativity of the canonical enhanceosome has only been demonstrated on nonmethylated DNA. Thus, it is also possible that RFX functions without the previously described enhanceosome to mediate promoter activation on methylated DNA. In short, it is now of considerable interest to determine the structure of the enhanceosome that forms on methylated HLA-DRA promoter sequences. The above described mechanism of transitioning from a repressed methylated promoter to an activated promoter raises the question of whether demethylation must occur prior to transcription? Whereas our data indicate that RFX does not facilitate demethylation, there has not been a determination of whether demethylation occurs following the addition of CIITA, which in the above described system regulates the initiation of transcription. CIITA recruitment to the enhanceosome is concomitant with histone acetyltransferase activity in the enhancesome (32Beresford G.W. Boss J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33Raval A. Howcroft T.K. Weissman J.D. Kirshner S. Zhu X.S. Yokoyama K. Ting J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The histone acetyltransferase activity could be sufficient for the nucleosome remodeling that is necessary for pre-initiation complex formation and transcription of methylated DNA, consistent with other systems where methylation per se does not interfere with transcription (9De Larco J.E. Wuertz B.R. Yee D. Rickert B.L. Furcht L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13988-13993Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Unoki M. Nakamura Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Warnecke P.M. Clark S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 164-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that Oct-1 and YY1 appear to be required for a full activation of methylated DNA by RFX (Fig. 7B) suggest that it is the methylated DNA that is being transcribed. If there were an essentially immediate transition to demethylated DNA with CIITA addition, lack of Oct-1 or YY1 should lead to a de-repression, as in Fig. 7A. Presumably at some point, there is a transition from methylated DNA to demethylated DNA, raising the question of whether this transition is instigated by one or multiple rounds of mRNA transcription? If transcription is required for demethylation in the above described RFX-HLA-DRA system, the role of transcription in facilitating DNA demethylation would be reminiscent of other covalent DNA modifications that are stimulated by transcription, such as immunoglobulin class switching and DNA repair (43Chaudhuri J. Alt F.W. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 44Wang C.L. Wabl M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5815-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 45Ljungman M. Lane D.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Our conclusions also raise the question, which proteins or class of proteins might mediate the DNA sequence specificity for other methylated promoters? The HLA-DRA promoter binding specificity for the RFX interaction with condensed chromatin and methylated DNA requires all three subunits (Fig. 3) (46Masternak K. Barras E. Zufferey M. Conrad B. Corthals G. Aebersold R. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Mach B. Reith W. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Multiple RFX5 family members (RFX1–5) have well studied and related “RFX5-type” DNA binding domains (39Reith W. Mach B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 331-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and related DNA binding sites. In summary, it is not likely that significant promoter specificity resides exclusively in the RFX5-type DNA binding domain common to the RFX5 family members. The other two RFX subunits, RFXAP (38Durand B. Sperisen P. Emery P. Barras E. Zufferey M. Mach B. Reith W.

It seems likely that other, currently unknown proteins substitute for RFXAP and RFXB in establishing sequence specificity for other methylated promoters. However, at this point, it is formally possible that all other promoters that undergo a transition from repression by methylation to activation interact with the same RFX trimer that mediates the activation of the methylated HLA-DRA promoter. Recently, RFXAP has been shown to interact with the chromatin remodeling factor BRG-1 (49Mudhasani R. Fontes J.D. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), very likely able to facilitate the decondensation of chromatin that would be expected to occur as part of a transition from methylated DNA to transcriptionally active DNA. Our data and conclusions have implications for transitions between different repressosomes, and in particular indicate that demethylation of DNA is likely to represent a mechanism of transitioning between repressosomes. For example, demethylation of the HLA-DRA promoter represents a transition from the MBD protein-related repressosome that regulates methylated HLA-DRA DNA (Fig. 1) to the DRAN (Oct-1 related) (14Osborne A.

The results of this and previous studies are combined into an initial three-dimensional working model of the multisynthetase complex. This is the first conceptualization of how the protein constituents and tRNA substrates are arrayed within the structural confines of this multiprotein assembly. It has been known for many years that a “core” complex of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases can be isolated from all multicellular eukaryotes (1.Yang D.C. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Its characteristic composition is three non-synthetase proteins and eight polypeptides having nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities. With the enzymes abbreviated as the three-letter amino acid name plus RS for the enzyme, the components are ArgRS, AspRS, GluProRS, GlnRS, IleRS, LeuRS, LysRS, MetRS, p43, p38, and p18. Several of these are known dimers, so the total polypeptide count in the multisynthetase complex is at least fifteen. This is a particularly intriguing protein assembly as all of the enzymes catalyze the same reaction, albeit with individual and highly specific substrates. The reaction catalyzed is the covalent attachment of an amino acid to either the 2′- or 3′-hydroxyl of the 3′-terminal adenosine of tRNA. Recent increased interest in these enzymes has been generated by studies indicating that they have roles in a variety of other cellular processes (2.Martinis S.A. Plateau P. Cavarelli J. Florentz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3.Francklyn C. Perona J.J. Puetz J. Hou Y.M. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4.Han J.M. Kim J.Y. Kim S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Such activities range from cytokine-mediated chemoattraction to priming of reverse transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 genome. These enzymes are also viewed as targets in the development of new antimicrobial agents (5.Schimmel P. Tao J. Hill J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1599-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The multisynthetase complex also contains three non-synthetase proteins. The first of these, p18, has been shown to interact with EF-1γ, which may facilitate transfer of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome (6.Sang Lee J. Gyu Park S. Park H. Seol W. Lee S. Kim S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Data from yeast two-hybrid screens (7.Quevillon S. Agou F. Robinson J.C. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32573-32579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), in vitro binding assays (8.Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and deletion analysis (9.Kim J.Y. Kang Y.S. Lee J.W. Kim H.J. Ahn Y.H. Park H. Ko Y.G. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7912-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) indicate that p38 functions as a scaffolding protein and appears to be essential for complex assembly. Of particular interest is protein p43, which also appears to have multiple functions. Possibilities include tRNA binding, modulation of aminoacylation activity, a cytokine precursor, as well as providing structural integrity to the multisynthetase complex (10.Guigou L. Shalak V. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4592-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11.Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17921-17924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To understand how its components function within the multisynthetase complex, knowledge of its blueprint is necessary. That is, accurate description of the topology of the complex is necessary for the study of its assembly, disassembly, and, perhaps, the formation of sub-complex structures. Placement of the protein components within particular areas of the structure was begun some time ago through use of chaotropic salts to prepare and characterize sub-complexes (13.Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15398-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then, a number of nearest-neighbor protein interactions within the isolated complex were detected via chemical cross-linking studies (14.Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using an in vivo approach, a number of potential component interactions have been identified by yeast two-hybrid genetic screens (15.Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16.Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance measurements were used to examine interactions of individual proteins from the complex (8.Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Additional information regarding the approximate location of one of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and of p43 was provided by immunoelectron microscopy (12.Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17921-17924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17.Norcum M.T. Dignam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12205-12208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As a result of the above studies, two working models of the distribution of polypeptides within the multisynthetase complex are now extant. The first model is derived from combination of the chemical cross-linking data with two-hybrid analyses (4.Han J.M. Kim J.Y. Kim S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The complex is presented as two domains with GlnRS and ArgRS in one section and all of the other enzymes in a second, larger domain. The auxiliary proteins are at the heart of the complex with p38 interactions responsible for connecting the two domains. The second model divides the multisynthetase complex into three domains (14.Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The supporting data include characterization of sub-complexes, reversible chemical cross-linking experiments, and electron microscopy. The AspRS dimer, MetRS, and GlnRS are placed in one “arm” of the complex. A second arm is composed of the LysRS and ArgRS dimers. These two arms extend from a “base” composed of GluProRS, IleRS, and LeuRS. The auxiliary protein p43 is perceived as a bridge that connects the domains and stabilizes the structure. In this working model, other arrangements of the proteins are possible within the constraints of the data. Although these models are a good start toward an understanding of the structure and function of the multisynthetase complex, they present only a two-dimensional view of the particle. However, three-dimensional reconstructions of both rabbit and human multisynthetase complex are now available (18.Wolfe C.L. Warrington J.A. Davis S. Green S. Norcum M.T. Boisset N. Dignam J.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In both, the particle is shaped as an asymmetric “V.” Its most striking features are a deep central cleft and multiple “windows” into the interior. These reconstructions are of sufficient resolution to show distinct protrusions and sub-domains of the particle, which are likely to correspond to individual proteins within the structure. The work presented herein is a first step toward the goal of extending to three dimensions the placement of proteins and tRNAs within the multisynthetase complex. Such information in turn is fundamental in providing answers to the questions posed above regarding how the multisynthetase complex actually works. This initial approach examines the distribution of tRNA binding sites on the particle and uses this information to position the corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. By use of its cognate tRNA labeled with a gold reporter molecule, the position of the LeuRS active site is placed at a specific location within the three-dimensional structure of the human multisynthetase complex as calculated from electron microscopic images. The positions of the C termini of the p43-His6 dimer within the particle have been identified by use of a gold-labeled probe designed to interact with the hexahistidine tag. Thus, we now have the first conceptualization of the positions of tRNAs and specific proteins within the context of the “core” multiprotein complex of eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Moreover, this study describes the first incorporation of a tagged protein component into the particle. Cell Lines—Human erythroleukemia K562 cells were grown under standard conditions (18.Wolfe C.L. Warrington J.A. Davis S. Green S. Norcum M.T. Boisset N. Dignam J.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Control human embryonal kidney 293-F cells and those expressing p43-His6 were maintained in Freestyle™ 293 Expression Medium according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). To create the latter cell line, total cellular RNA was isolated from 293-F cells (Promega SV Total RNA Isolation System™), and the p43 open reading frame was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (Promega Access RT-PCR System™). The primers used for the amplification were CCCACTGTCGACATGGCAAATAATGATGCTGTTCTGAAG and CCCACTGGATCCTTTGATTCCACTGTTGCTCATGGTTTG. The gene was inserted into the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the coding sequences for the V5 epitope and hexahistidine sequence. This tagged p43 construct was named pEFp43-His. Next, 293-F cells were transfected with linearized pEFp43-His using Lipofect-AMINE2000™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells resistant to 6 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) were selected and maintained as stable transfectants in culture medium containing 3 μg/ml blasticidin. Isolation of Multisynthetase Complex—For the tRNA binding experiments, the core multisynthetase complex was isolated from K562 cells as previously described (18.Wolfe C.L. Warrington J.A. Davis S. Green S. Norcum M.T. Boisset N. Dignam J.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For samples used in localization of p43, a new isolation method using lysine-agarose chromatography was developed. This procedure is scaled to the smaller amounts of cellular material used, is rapid, and requires fewer steps. Approximately 1 g (wet weight) of control or transfected 293F cells was suspended in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Nα-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor-EDTA mixture (Roche Applied Science). After gentle Dounce homogenization one-fifth volume of 5× column buffer (250 mm Hepes, 25 mm Mg Acetate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, pH 7.2) was added. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g to remove insoluble cell debris and then loaded onto a 2-ml lysine-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been pre-equilibrated with 1× column buffer. The column was successively washed with three column volumes of 25 mm lysine in 1× column buffer then one column volume each of of 1× column buffer alone, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA (Sigma) in 1× column buffer, and 2 mg/ml tRNA in 1× column buffer. Partially purified multisynthetase complex was then eluted with 10 mg/ml tRNA in 1× column buffer. For specific isolation of multisynthetase complex containing p43-His6, lysate was loaded onto a 1-ml HIS-Select™ nickel affinity column (Sigma) that had been pre-equilibrated with 1× column buffer. After washing with 3 column volumes of the same buffer, protein was eluted with a gradient of 0 to 200 mm imidazole in column buffer. Labeling of tRNA—Total yeast tRNA (Sigma) and Escherichia coli tRNALeu were commercially prepared (Subriden RNA, Rolling Bay, WA). After evaluation of a variety of methods for tRNA labeling, it was found that modification of the 5′-end could be accomplished with consistency and efficiency while retaining the most specificity of binding to the appropriate polypeptide within the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex. A typical reaction mixture contained 50 μg of tRNA in 50 μl of 0.1 m imidazole, pH 6, 5 mg of N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, and 6 nmol of monoamino-Nanogold™ (Nanoprobes). After 2 h at room temperature on a rotating wheel, excess labeling reagent was removed by gel filtration, and the tRNA was collected by precipitation at -20 °C with the addition of 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5, and 3 volumes of cold 100% ethanol. Extent of labeling was calculated using A420 for the Nanogold and A260 for tRNA. Labeling efficiency was routinely 80-90%. Labeling of Multisynthetase Complex with tRNA—Covalent labeling of multisynthetase complex with total yeast tRNA or gold-labeled E. coli tRNALeu was accomplished by use of 3′-end oxidation of the tRNAs and reaction with protein in the presence of mild reductant (19.Hountondji C. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 102: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, oxidized tRNAs were prepared by incubation in 3 mm sodium periodate for 10 min at room temperature in the dark, collected by ethanol precipitation as above, and stored at -20 °C in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate. Reaction mixtures for tRNA linkage to multisynthetase complex contained 1-15 pmol of protein, 15-25 molar excess of oxidized tRNA, 5 μm sodium cyanoborohydride, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5% glycerol. Reactions were for 20 min at 30 °C. For analysis by electron microscopy, nonspecific binding was minimized by addition of NaCl to a concentration of 0.1 m and removal of excess tRNA by HPLC 3The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; xxxRS, where xxx is the three letter amino acid code and RS is aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. gel filtration (BioSep SPC5 column, Phenomenex). Derivatized complex was eluted isocratically with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl. Analytical Methods—SDS-PAGE analysis was on 7.5% gels (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Proteins and tRNA-protein adducts were visualized using alkaline silver stain (21.Giulian G.G. Moss R.L. Greaser M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The method for immunodetection has been previously described (18.Wolfe C.L. Warrington J.A. Davis S. Green S. Norcum M.T. Boisset N. Dignam J.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The anti-V5 antibody (Bethyl) was used in dilution ranging from 1:5,000 to 1:10,000. The anti-p43 antibody (US Biological) was generated from a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal region of the p43/EMAPII cleavage site (7.Quevillon S. Agou F. Robinson J.C. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32573-32579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and used in a 1:4,000 dilution. Detection was achieved with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent System™ (Pierce). For electron microscopy, samples from control and transfected cells were incubated for 15 min with 50 μl of nickel-nitriloacetic acid attached to Nanogold (Ni-NTA-Nanogold™, Nanoprobes, Inc.), filtered through a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and excess labeling reagent removed by HPLC size fractionation. Samples of 300-400 μl were applied to a Biosep-Sec-S 4000 column (Phenomenex) equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. The same buffer was used for isocratic elution of protein at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min with collection ∼100-μl fractions. Absorbance was simultaneously monitored at 260, 280, and 420 nm. Electron Microscopy—Samples for electron microscopy were negatively stained with methylamine vanadate (NanoVan™, Nanoprobes, Inc.) as previously described (18.Wolfe C.L. Warrington J.A. Davis S. Green S. Norcum M.T. Boisset N. Dignam J.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using a LEO 912 microscope at 100 kV with the inline energy filter, micrographs were taken on Kodak SO-163 film with minimum dose focusing at nominal magnification of 50,000× and an approximate defocus of 2 μm. The negatives were then digitized on an Agfa Duoscan flatbed scanner at an optical resolution that provided 4.01 Å/pixel on the image scale. Image Analysis—Three-dimensional structures of multisynthetase complexes were calculated using SPIDER software (22.Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). For each of the structures presented herein completely new data sets were obtained except for 3520 images that were previously used for the initial calculation of the structure of the human cytoplasmic multisynthetase complex from K562 cells (18.Wolfe C.L. Warrington J.A. Davis S. Green S. Norcum M.T. Boisset N. Dignam J.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All data sets were obtained by manual particle selection. The number of images selected per micrograph ranged from ∼150 to 250. Actual numbers of images in the initial data sets and those used for the reconstruction calcuations are given under “Results” where each is described. Through the use of a series of SPIDER (22.Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar) commands, each reconstruction calculation began with reference-free rotational and translational alignment of the images. The Eulerian orientation angles were then obtained by mapping each image to the appropriate primary reference structure as specified below. That is, the reference was projected at 10° angular intervals, which provided 194 views. Each image was compared with each projection and classified as best fitting a particular projection based on the correlation coefficient. The data set was then limited to those images with acceptable correlation coefficients. The cutoff varied among data sets, but a value near or above 0.8 was typical. An initial three-dimensional structure was then calculated by iterative back projection. Then, a second round of projection mapping was used to refine each initial structure. That is, 194 projections of the new structure were calculated again at 10° angular intervals. The appropriate angular orientations of each image in the data set were again obtained based on highest correlation coefficient with respect to a particular projection. The second round of iterative back projection differed from the first in that the number of images in each class was limited to a consistent number of images with the highest correlation coefficients to prevent any adverse effects of overrepresentation of particular views (23.Sorzano C.O. Marabini R. Boisset N. Rietzel E. Schroder R. Herman G.T. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two primary reference structures were used in the first round of projection mapping for the various data sets analyzed in this study. The first was that previously calculated from images of human multisynthetase complex from K562 cells negatively stained with methylamine vanadate (18.Wolfe C.L. Warrington J.A. Davis S. Green S. Norcum M.T. Boisset N. Dignam J.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This provided the projections to which images were mapped from the data sets with bound total tRNA and with labeled tRNALeu. The second primary reference was a refinement of the previously published structure (18.Wolfe C.L. Warrington J.A. Davis S. Green S. Norcum M.T. Boisset N. Dignam J.D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) accomplished by a 40% increase in the data set using new images of the particle as isolated from 293-F cells. This was used for calculation of structures for complex isolated by the new lysyl-agarose method, those containing p43-His6, and with bound Ni-NTA-Nanogold (Nanoprobes, Inc). The positions of bound Nanogold-tRNALeu and of bound Ni-NTA-Nanogold were determined by calculation of difference maps between the control and labeled reconstructions. Because the images were of negatively stained samples, this required the counterintuitive subtraction of the labeled structure from the control. Resolution limits were determined from the 50% point of the Fourier shell correlation between reconstructions calculated from half data sets. Reconstructions are displayed after filtration to the appropriate resolution. The reconstruction surface representation thresholds were determined from the number of voxels corresponding to 100% of the predicted mass of the particle as adjusted for variations in partial specific volume. Specifically, the unlabeled particle mass is 1.2 MDa (1.Yang D.C. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 4M. Rheban, V. Chalifa-Caspi, J. Prilusky, and D. Lancet (1997) bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il/cards-bin/carddisp?[gene], Weizmann Institute of Science, Bioinformatics Units and Genome Center (Rehovot, Israel). To account for the gold particle (25.Hainfeld J.F. Powell R.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and tRNALeu, the mass value used for the threshold of the reconstruction from the sample labeled with gold-tRNALeu was 1.24 MDa. For that labeled with total yeast tRNA, a value of 1.3 MDa was used, which assumes an average of four bound tRNAs of 25 kDa each. The number of bound tRNAs was estimated from the values in TABLE ONE. For the particle containing p43-His6, 5 kDa was added due to the extension of p43 and 144 kDa for Ni-NTA-Nanogold. Values of partial specific volumes used were 0.73 for protein, 0.6 for tRNA, and 0.25 for the gold cluster. Presentations of surfaces, projections, and overlays were prepared using the WEB portion of the SPIDER package and Explorer (Numerical Algorithms Group).TABLE ONEExtent of labeling of the multisynthetase complex with oxidized yeast tRNAAminoacyl-tRNA synthetasePercent labeling%Aspartyl7Arginyl and lysylaThese two proteins could not be sufficiently separated via electrophoresis to determine individual levels of labeling.42Glutamyl/prolylbThis is a bifunctional enzyme containing the two listed activities.77Glutaminyl28Isoleucyl47Leucyl72Methionyl41a These two proteins could not be sufficiently separated via electrophoresis to determine individual levels of labeling.b This is a bifunctional enzyme containing the two listed activities. Open table in a new tab Positioning of Multiple Bound tRNAs—As a way to obtain a general idea of how the multisynthetase complex accommodates the simultaneous binding of multiple tRNAs, a reconstruction was calculated after reaction with a mixture of tRNAs. TABLE ONE shows the extent of covalent binding of tRNAs to enzymes within the complex after reacting it with 3′-end oxidized total yeast tRNA in the presence of a mild reducing agent. These values were calculated by comparison of the densities of each band of the polypeptide in control and labeled samples after separation by SDS-PAGE. Because approximately three-fourths of Glu-ProRS and LeuRS were labeled, it was likely that the corresponding tRNAs would form visible additions to the structure. Also, labeling of ArgRS, IleRS, LysRS, and MetRS all were >40%. The signal generated in such cases of partial labeling is reduced because of the contribution of unlabeled particles in the data set. Thus, any new areas of density seen in the corresponding reconstruction are a minimal representation of actual tRNA binding sites. Calculation of three-dimensional reconstructions of both control and labeled multisynthetase complex (Fig. 1, A and B) were from initial data sets of 9,244 and 12,225 images obtained by manual selection. The refined structures were calculated from 8,839 and 11,153 images, respectively. These were the images that best matched each angular projection of the reference as based on highest correlation coefficient. The limits were 50 and 70 images per projection, respectively. As shown below in Fig. 4A, this limit provided complete and even angular coverage. That is, each circle corresponds to one of the 194 reference projections, and the diameter represents the number of images that mapped to that projection. Thus, there should be no artifactual effects from either missing or overrepresented angular information.FIGURE 4Demonstration of completeness of data sets and resolution limits for the reconstructions calculated for tRNA-labeled multisynthetase complex.

C, determination of resolution limits from Fourier shell correlation coefficients between reconstructions calculated from half data sets. Using the 50% cut-off, the limit for both reconstructions is ∼29 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From the values in TABLE ONE, it was assumed that an average of four tRNAs was bound and so the visualization threshold for the labeled volume was based on a mass of 100 kDa more than the control. Because protein accounts for the vast majority of the structures, the contribution of tRNA to the partial specific volumes was small. However, this was also taken into account in determining the threshold value. The resolution limits of the volumes were matched by filtering both to that of the labeled structure, which is 29 Å as determined using the Fourier shell correlation coefficient plot (Fig. 4C). In the labeled structure (Fig. 1A), numerous densities were visible that were not present in that of the control (see Fig. 1B). All were unique to the labeled volume. That is, expansion of the control volume by lowering the visualization threshold did not reproduce the additional densities of the labeled structure. Thus, these new structural features correspond to sites of tRNA binding. The three orientations of the volumes shown were chosen to provide the clearest views of the areas of notable difference between the labeled and control structures. In the “front” view (top row), two areas of tRNA binding were visible (arrow"
https://openalex.org/W1967721879,"Protein-protein interactions have emerged as an important mechanism providing for specificity in cellular signal transduction. Two splice variants of type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG Iα and Iβ) differ only in their N-terminal ∼100 amino acids, which mediate binding to different target proteins. PKG Iβ, but not Iα, binds to the general transcriptional regulator TFII-I and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-associated PKG substrate IRAG. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro binding assays, we identified a group of acidic amino acids in the N-terminal leucine zipper dimerization domain of PKG Iβ required for its binding to both TFII-I and IRAG. Small clusters of basic amino acids in possible α-helical regions in TFII-I and IRAG were found to mediate their interaction with PKG Iβ. Mutation of two negatively charged residues in the PKG Iβ leucine zipper (D26K/E31R) to positively charged residues, found in corresponding positions in PKG Iα, completely abrogated binding to TFII-I and IRAG without disrupting PKG dimerization. Mutation of specific basic residues in TFII-I or IRAG abolished binding of the full-length proteins to PKG Iβ in intact cells. Based on these results, we propose a model for specific PKG Iβ interaction with target proteins.

Signaling complexes including modulatory proteins, protein kinases, and phosphatases, and their substrates are held together by specific protein-protein interactions and provide selectivity in signal transduction, because they target the kinases/phosphatases to specific substrates (1.Smith F.D.

One of the most thoroughly studied models of protein kinase targeting is that of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), 3The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; AKAP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase anchoring protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IRAG, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-associated PKG substrate; MBS, myosin binding subunit; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase. a tetrameric enzyme composed of two catalytic subunits bound to a regulatory subunit dimer (2.Colledge M.

Specific protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) tether the regulatory subunits to various subcellular locations and place the kinase in close proximity to appropriate substrates (1.Smith F.D.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). AKAPs have been shown to play an important role in determining the specificity of PKA signaling. They share a common binding motif of an amphipathic helix that interacts with a hydrophobic pocket within the extreme N terminus of the PKA regulatory subunit dimer (3.Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Carr D.W. Westphal R. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A peptide modeled after the binding motif of AKAP Ht31 disrupts PKA anchoring in intact cells, and experiments with this peptide have shown that PKA phosphorylation of specific substrates and regulation of many cellular processes, such as cardiomyocyte contractility, depend on proper localization of the kinase (2.Colledge M.

Bond M. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) are highly homologous to PKAs, but PKGs exist as homodimers, with the regulatory and catalytic domains located on a single peptide chain (5.Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 275-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Two types of PKGs have been identified in mammalian cells: type I PKG (PKG I) exists as two different splice variants from the same gene (PKG Iα and PKG Iβ), with distinct N-terminal dimerization domains but identical regulatory and catalytic domains; type II PKG (PKG II) is encoded by a separate gene and shares with PKG I about 80% homology in the regulatory and 75% homology in the catalytic domain (5.Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 275-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The sequences of PKGs and the PKA regulatory subunits diverge most at their extreme N termini, the region that is responsible for PKA dimerization and anchoring and that is unique between the PKG I splice variants. The N termini of PKA regulatory subunits form a four-helix bundle, whereas heptad leucine/isoleucine repeats in the N termini of PKGs suggest a leucine zipper domain (3.Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D.

The latter prediction is supported by site-directed mutagenesis of PKG Iβ and solution NMR analysis of amino acids 1–39 of PKG Iα (6.Atkinson R.A. Saudek V. Huggins J.P. Pelton J.T.

We characterized the interaction between TFII-I and PKG Iβ in vitro and in vivo and found that TFII-I phosphorylation by PKG Iβ in vivo enhanced transcriptional activation of a serum response factor-dependent reporter gene (10.Casteel D.E.

TFII-I appears to be a molecular scaffold, binding to a wide variety of DNA elements (serum response element, Inr, E-box), and coordinating the activity of multiple transcription factors (serum response factor, USF-1, Myc, Phox1), histone deacetylases, and signaling molecules (PKG Iβ, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, Src kinase) (12.Roy A.L.

TFII-I co-localizes with PKG Iβ in intact cells and may serve to position the kinase to phosphorylate other proteins in a multiprotein complex (10.Casteel D.E. Zhuang S. Gudi T. Tang J. Vuica M.

IRAG also exists in a multiprotein complex, which includes PKG Iβ, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, phospholamban, and other proteins (11.Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X.

PKG Iβ phosphorylation of IRAG inhibits inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-dependent Ca2+ release, leading to smooth muscle relaxation (11.Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A.

In the present study, we identified a PKG Iβ-specific interaction motif in TFII-I and IRAG, which consists of a predicted α-helical structure with several basic amino acids on one face of the helix; this electropositive region binds to a highly negatively charged region within the N-terminal PKG Iβ leucine zipper. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2 (10.Casteel D.E. Zhuang S. Gudi T. Tang J. Vuica M. Desiderio S. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32003-32014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were transfected using Polyfect™ (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. IRAG Cloning—IRAGa and IRAGb are N-terminal splice variants from the same gene that share the PKG Iβ binding region (11.Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.-X. Allescher H.-D. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). IRAGb (referred to as IRAG throughout) was cloned via reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA isolated from primary bovine aortic smooth muscle cells. The coding sequence was cloned in three parts, using the following primer pairs: IR1 (5′-CATATGCCCCACATTCCCGAG-3′) and IR2 (5′-AGCCCCACTAAGTTCTGATTTC-3′); IR3 (5-′GGATCCGCAGTGGTGGGAAGATGGC-3′) and IR4 (5′-GCTGGTAAGGAAGGAATGGG-3′); IR5 (5′-GGATCCATGTGGAGAACCTAAAGAGGACG-3′) and IR6 (5′-TCCCCTGATGGCAGCAGTGG-3′). All PCR products were ligated into pPCR (16.Borovkov A.Y. Rivkin M.I. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 812-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and sequenced. The sequence was identical to the published bovine IRAGb sequence (11.Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.-X. Allescher H.-D. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) with the exception of three amino acid changes outside the PKG Iβ-binding region: A222P, which is a proline in rat, human, and mouse IRAG; Q237H, which is a glutamine in other species (but two independent PCR clones contained a histidine); and V768A, which is an alanine in canine IRAG. Full-length IRAG was constructed using internal restriction sites. DNA Constructs—The plasmid pMycD was constructed by inserting the following Myc epitope tag linker into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen): 5′-AGCTGCCACCATGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGGATG-3′ (sense); 5′-GATCCATCCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCCAGTGTGGC-3′ (antisense). Full-length IRAG was inserted into pMycD as a BamHI/NotI fragment in frame and downstream of the Myc epitope. Myc/His-tagged IRAG-(1–415) was constructed by first inserting the PCR product formed by the IR1/IR2 primer pair into BamHI/XhoI-digested pMycD and then excising the Myc-IRAG fragment with NcoI/XbaI and inserting it into NcoI/HindIII-digested pRSET (Novagen) using XbaI/HindIII linkers. A TFII-I (R4) glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was constructed in pGEXkgl using the following PCR primers: 5′-AGGATCCTGGGCAATCGAATTAAATTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCGGCCGCTAGGACTGCAAAGCTTTAGTG-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was ligated into pPCR and subcloned into pGEXkgl using BamHI and NotI restriction enzymes. GST-tagged PKG Iβ-(1–110) (containing the first 110 amino acids unique to PKG Iβ), pCMVGSTD-PKG Iβ (containing full-length PKG Iβ), pCMVGSTD-PKG Iα (containing full-length PKG Iα), pRSETB-TFII-I-myc, and pCB6-TFII-I-myc have been described previously (10.Casteel D.E.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—For site-directed mutagenesis, PKG Iβ-(1–110), TFII-I (R4), or IRAG-(1–415) were cloned into the BamHI/SalI sites of the vector pALTER-1™ (Promega). Mutagenesis reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutants were sequenced and inserted into pGEXkgl. In Vivo Interaction Studies—COS7 cells were harvested 24–48 h post-transfection and lysed in buffer A (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Beads were washed three times in buffer A and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, using the indicated antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies with chemiluminescence detection (17.Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In Vitro Interaction Studies—Full-length human PKG Iβ was purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as previously described (10.Casteel D.E. Zhuang S. Gudi T. Tang J. Vuica M. Desiderio S. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32003-32014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). His/Myc-tagged full-length TFII-I and His/Myc-tagged IRAG-(1–415) were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified using nickel column chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). GST and GST fused to the N-terminal 110 amino acids of PKG Iβ were produced in DH5α E. coli. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 and allowed to grow for 1 h, shaking at 37 °C. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cultures were grown for an additional 5 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold buffer A, and disrupted by sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Beads were washed three times in buffer A, and aliquots of the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining and compared with a bovine serum albumin standard to determine the amount of bound GST fusion protein. In pull-down experiments, equal amounts of GST fusion proteins (20 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 200 μl of buffer A containing 1 μg/ml of the test protein. After a 1-h incubation, the beads were washed three times in buffer A and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. To test the effect of increasing salt concentrations on the TFII-I/PKG Iβ interaction, GST-TFII-I (R4) was immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated for 1 h with 200 ng of purified PKG Iβ in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, containing the indicated amount of NaCl (50–400 mm). After three washes in the same binding buffer, binding was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Data Presentation—Western blots and autoradiographs are shown from representative experiments that were reproduced at least three times with similar results. TFII-I and IRAG Interact Specifically with Full-length PKG Iβ but Not PKG Iα in Vivo—We previously found that TFII-I bound to the N terminus of PKG Iβ but not to the same region of PKG Iα (10.Casteel D.E.

To compare the binding of TFII-I to full-length PKG Iβ versus PKG Iα in intact cells, COS7 cells were transfected with the vector pCB6-TFII-I-myc plus either pCMVGSTD-PKG Iβ, pCMVGSTD-PKG Iα, or pCMVGSTD (parent vector). Cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and washed beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an antibody specific for the Myc epitope on TFII-I. TFII-I was pulled down by GST-tagged PKG Iβ but not by GST-tagged PKG Iα or by GST alone (Fig. 1A). We performed similar experiments using full-length Myc-tagged IRAG in place of TFII-I and, as reported by Schlossmann et al. (11.Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.-X. Allescher H.-D. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), found that IRAG interacts specifically with PKG Iβ (Fig. 1B). Thus, although TFII-I and IRAG are both PKG substrates and PKG Iα and PKG Iβ have identical catalytic subunits, PKG Iα did not interact with TFII-I or IRAG under the experimental conditions used in the GST pull-down assay. Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous TFII-I or IRAG with PKG Iβ has been shown previously (10.Casteel D.E. Zhuang S. Gudi T. Tang J. Vuica M. Desiderio S. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32003-32014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11.Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.-X. Allescher H.-D.

Electrostatic Interactions Appear Important for the PKG Iβ/TFII-I Interaction—Ammendola et al. (15.Ammendola A. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24153-24159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) mapped the interaction between PKG Iβ and IRAG to a highly charged region near the N terminus of IRAG and suggested that the association between IRAG and PKG Iβ was probably mediated by ionic interactions. TFII-I has no significant sequence similarity to IRAG, but it contains six 90-amino acid-long I-repeats (R1–R6), each containing a putative helix-loop-helix motif, and we previously showed that PKG Iβ interacts with amino acids 491–628 of TFII-I, corresponding to R4 (10.Casteel D.E. Zhuang S. Gudi T. Tang J. Vuica M. Desiderio S. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32003-32014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether the PKG Iβ/TFII-I interaction might involve electrostatic forces between charged amino acid residues, we performed in vitro binding assays with purified proteins in the presence of increasing salt concentrations; we found that the interaction was disrupted by 400 mm NaCl (Fig. 2A). At this concentration, NaCl had no effect on either GST binding to the glutathione-Sepharose beads or on the stability of the PKG Iβ leucine zipper (Fig. 2B). The latter was determined by examining the stability of heterodimers formed between full-length PKG Iβ and GST-tagged PKG Iβ-(1–110) in co-transfected COS7 cells. GST-PKG Iβ-(1–110) was isolated on glutathione beads in the presence of increasing salt concentrations, and full-length PKG Iβ associated with the immobilized leucine zipper domain was detected using an antibody specific for the C terminus of PKG I. These results suggest that high salt concentrations may interfere with important ionic interactions between PKG Iβ and TFII-I, although we cannot exclude the possibility that increasing salt concentrations could also destabilize the structure of TFII-I (R4). Acidic Residues within the PKG Iβ Leucine Zipper Mediate Its Interaction with TFII-I and IRAG—Since TFII-I and IRAG bound specifically to PKG Iβ and not PKG Iα, and since both proteins may bind via salt-sensitive ionic interactions, we reasoned that charged residues within the PKG Iβ leucine zipper would be important for binding and that these residues should differ between both PKG isoforms. We aligned the N-terminal primary sequences of PKG Iα and Iβ and looked for residues with opposite charges (i.e. a basic amino acid in one protein and an acidic amino acid in the other) (Fig. 3A). We then mutated each of these residues in PKG Iβ, changing the charge to that in PKG Iα, and tested the mutants for interaction with TFII-I and IRAG. We also mutated charged residues in PKG Iβ that were N-terminal to the alignment with PKG Iα. A D26K or E31K mutation completely disrupted the interaction with TFII-I, whereas an E16K mutation reduced the interaction, and other mutations were without significant effect (Fig. 3B). To test the interaction of the mutants with IRAG, we used a construct consisting of the first 415 amino acids of IRAG fused to both Myc- and His-tags, because full-length IRAG is proteolytically degraded when expressed in E. coli. 4D. E. Casteel and R. B. Pilz, unpublished observation. The truncated IRAG protein was still partially degraded, yielding several bands on Western blots (Fig. 3C). The same two N-terminal PKG Iβ mutations that ablated interaction with TFII-I noticeably reduced the interaction with IRAG, whereas the other mutations were without effect (Fig. 3C). Since the interaction of PKG Iβ with IRAG was not completely eliminated by any of the mutations, we tested another set of mutants, using our charge reversal strategy, with the exception of leucine 30 in PKG Iβ, which we changed to a lysine found in PKG Iα (Fig. 4A). The interaction of PKG Iβ with TFII-I was completely disrupted by the mutations D22K, E27K, E29K, and D26K/E31R and was reduced by an E17K mutation (Fig. 4B). Interaction with IRAG was only disrupted by the E29K and D26K/E31R mutations (Fig. 4C). Whereas the E29K mutant disrupted the interaction with both TFII-I and IRAG, E27K only affected the interaction with TFII-I. Thus, although not strictly identical, acidic residues within the same region of the PKG Iβ leucine zipper (Glu17–Glu31) are involved in the interaction with both TFII-I and IRAG. The E29K and D26K/E31R Mutations Do Not Disrupt Dimerization of PKG Iβ—The interaction between PKG Iα and troponin T or the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase is disrupted by alanine mutations of two key leucine/isoleucine residues in the N-terminal leucine zipper domain, which presumably interfere with dimer formation of PKG Iα (7.Richie-Jannetta R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37429-37434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to determine whether the two PKG Iβ mutants that completely disrupted interaction with TFII-I and IRAG could form stable dimers. COS7 cells were transfected with constructs expressing GST, GST-PKG Iβ-(1–110) E29K, or mutant D26K/E31R and co-transfected with full-length PKG Iβ containing the corresponding mutations. GST or GST-tagged proteins were isolated on glutathione beads, and dimerization was detected by association of the full-length mutant protein with the mutant PKG Iβ-(1–110). As shown in Fig. 5, dimer formation was not disrupted in either mutant protein. We also examined dimerization using gel filtration chromatography, which was performed similarly to that described by Richie-Jannetta et al. (7.Richie-Jannetta R. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50070-50079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The two full-length mutant PKG Iβ proteins were expressed in COS7 cells and were analyzed simultaneously with wild type PKG Iβ and an N-terminally truncated form of PKG Iβ that did not form dimers in experiments performed as described in Fig. 5. Mutant PKG Iβ E29K and D26K/E31R eluted from the gel filtration column at the same position as wild type kinase, which was several fractions before the momomeric PKG Iβ (data not shown). In addition, we performed circular dichroism spectroscopy to examine the helical content of PKG Iβ-(1–110) wild type and mutant D26K/E31R; we found that the wild type and mutant proteins produced very similar spectra with minima at 208 and 222 nm characteristic for α-helical proteins (data not shown). These results suggest that the D26K/E31R mutations do not grossly alter the structure of the leucine zipper and do not interfere with dimer formation. Small Clusters of Basic Residues within TFII-I and IRAG Mediate Binding to PKG Iβ—Since acidic residues within the N-terminal leucine zipper of PKG Iβ were necessary for the interaction with TFII-I, we reasoned that basic residues within the sequence of TFII-I may mediate binding to PKG Iβ. The TFII-I (R4) domain contains a small cluster of basic amino acids, residues 526–532 (Fig. 6A). The six I-repeat domains of TFII-I have conserved sequences and are thought to fold into helix-loop-helix structures, but only R4 was required for binding to PKG Iβ (10.Casteel D.E. Zhuang S. Gudi T.

Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). By aligning residues 523–534 of R4 with the corresponding residues of the other repeats, we observed that three of four basic amino acids in the cluster are not conserved among the other repeats; in fact, one or more of the other repeats contain an acidic residue in these positions, suggesting that opposite charges do not interfere with folding of the domain (Fig. 6A). For example, K529 in TFII-I (R4) corresponds to aspartate in the second and fifth repeat, and we can infer that changing this lysine to aspartate will not disrupt the secondary or tertiary structure of R4. In addition, alanine scanning was used to further characterize critical residues. Mutation of Arg531 (a conserved basic amino acid in all repeats) was not examined, because change of this residue to alanine caused a dramatic loss in protein solubility, indicating that this mutation disrupted stable protein folding. Binding of purified full-length PKG Iβ to various GST-tagged TFII-I R4 mutants was examined in an in vitro pull-down assay. Whereas all mutants shown in Fig. 6B disrupted the interaction with PKG Iβ to some degree, the R526E and R526A/K529A mutations had the greatest effect. In contrast, site-directed mutagenesis of neighboring, noncharged amino acids (V525A and Q544E) had no effect on the PKG Iβ/TFII-I (R4) interaction (data not shown). The interaction of IRAG with PKG Iβ has been mapped to a 32-amino acid peptide corresponding to residues 100–132 of IRAG (Fig. 7A) (15.Ammendola A. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24153-24159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine residues involved in the binding of IRAG to PKG Iβ, pairs of basic amino acids were mutated to alanines, and the various GST-tagged IRAG mutants were tested for their ability to interact with PKG Iβ in an in vitro pull-down assay. Mutation of residues Arg120, Arg124, and Arg125 to alanine had a major effect on the binding, whereas mutation of Arg127, Lys128, and Arg130 reduced the interaction between IRAG and PKG Iβ (Fig. 7B). The multiple bands observed in the anti-GST blot are the result of proteolysis of IRAG-(1–415), as described above. Secondary structure predictions suggest α-helical structures for the regions within TFII-I and IRAG that bind to PKG Iβ. As mentioned earlier, Roy et al. (19.Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) had predicted that the beginning of each I-repeat in TFII-I, including the region of R4 that interacted with PKG Iβ (Fig. 6), would form an α-helix as part of a helix-turn-helix motif. Using the Protein Structure Prediction Server PSIPRED (available on the World Wide Web at bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred) and the Network Protein Sequence Analysis Server [email protected] (available on the World Wide Web at pbil.ibcp.fr/npsa), we analyzed the full-length TFII-I and IRAG primary sequences (20.McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar, 21.Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The PKG Iβ-interacting region of TFII-I (Fig. 6A) is predicted to be α-helical between amino acids 526 and 545 by PSIPRED and between amino acids 523 and 545 by [email protected] The PKG Iβ-interacting region of IRAG (Fig. 7A) is predicted to be α-helical between amino acids 101 and 124 by PSIPRED and between amino acids 103 and 124 by [email protected] In addition, Chou-Fassman analysis using the MacVector™ program (Accelrys) (22.Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) predicts that the PKG Iβ-interacting regions of TFII-I and IRAG form α-helical structures. Interestingly, when these regions were plotted on helical wheels, the basic residues of TFII-I and IRAG proposed to contact PKG Iβ were located on one side of the predicted helices. Although these results are highly suggestive, it should be noted that further structural studies are needed to confirm the helical nature of the PKG Iβ interaction motif. Mutation of Critical Residues within Full-length TFII-I and IRAG Disrupt Their Interaction with PKG Iβ—We asked whether specific mutations in full-length TFII-I or IRAG would be sufficient to disrupt their interaction with PKG Iβ in intact cells. We co-transfected COS7 cells with vectors expressing GST-tagged full-length PKG Iβ and Myc-tagged wild type or mutant TFII-I or IRAG and found that full-length TFII-I containing the R526A/K529A mutations and full-length IRAG containing the R124A/R125A mutations no longer interacted with PKG Iβ in vivo (Fig. 8, A and B). We used site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro plus in vivo protein binding assays to identify molecular determinants of the isotype-specific PKG Iβ interaction with TFII-I and IRAG. Both TFII-I and IRAG bind a region of the PKG Iβ leucine zipper that is rich in acidic amino acids, whereas the PKG Iβ binding regions within TFII-I and IRAG contain basic amino acids residues and probably form α-helices. The primary sequences of the PKG Iβ interaction sites in TFII-I and IRAG otherwise show no similarities, but orientation of the basic amino acids on one face of a presumed α-helix may be important. Based on effects of specific mutations in both PKG Iβ and its interaction partners, combined with secondary structure predictions, we propose a model for PKG Iβ-specific anchoring, consisting of several positively charged amino acids arranged on one side of an α-helix, which interact with a cluster of negatively charged residues in the PKG Iβ leucine zipper. Specific mutations in the PKG Iβ leucine zipper (D26K/E31R) disrupted interaction with both TFII-I and IRAG. Since the D26K/E31R mutations change negatively charged residues in PKG Iβ to positively charged residues found in analogous positions in PKG Iα, these results may provide an explanation for PKG I isotype-specific binding. The binding affinity of PKG Iβ for its interaction partners is not known, but under our experimental conditions, detection of protein/protein interactions in pull-down assays using GST-tagged proteins requires a KD of ∼1 μm or less (e.g. the interaction between GST-tagged Raf-1 kinase and Rap1A is lost during multiple washes) (23.Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Janknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The effect of a single amino acid change on the binding affinity of two protein partners is difficult to predict, but a single charge change in the interface between two proteins that associate via electrostatic interactions can result in a >100-fold decrease in binding affinity (23.Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Block C. Janknecht R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Since the single amino acid change E29K in PKG Iβ was able to disrupt the interaction of PKG Iβ with both TFII-I and IRAG, this residue appears to be crucial for binding, and the charge change may result in repulsive instead of attractive forces between PKG Iβ and its partners. Although the anchoring of PKG Iβ to TFII-I and IRAG shared several common features, there were some noticeable differences. For example, the PKG Iβ E27K mutant completely prevented interaction with TFII-I, whereas the interaction with IRAG was not detectably affected. Thus, specific mutations in the PKG Iβ leucine zipper may disrupt interaction with a subset of PKG Iβ-interacting proteins. It may be possible to exploit this selective association of PKG Iβ with intracellular targets to dissect specific functions of the kinase. Our work concentrated on the two known PKG Iβ-specific interacting proteins, but preliminary data suggest that there are additional PKG Iβ-specific interacting proteins whose binding to the N-terminal region of PKG Iβ is prevented by the D26K/E31R mutation. We incubated cell lysates from [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled cells with immobilized GST-PKG Iβ-(1–110) wild type or mutant D26K/E31R or GST alone; we eluted the bound proteins with glutathione and analyzed them by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Several proteins between 25 and 80 kDa interacted specifically with wild type but not mutant PKG Iβ-(1–110) D26K/E31R or GST, suggesting that these proteins may share a common binding motif with TFII-I and IRAG.4 Work is in progress to identify these proteins. The leucine zipper domain of PKG Iα binds to a C-terminal leucine zipper domain in the MBS of myosin phosphatase, and mutations in the MBS leucine zipper that eliminate MBS homodimerization also disrupt interaction with PKG Iα; however, specific residues that mediate the interaction are not known (8.Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 24.Surks H.K. Mendelsohn M.E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Like MBS, the PKG interacting protein GKAP42 interacts specifically with PKG Iα, but not with PKG Iβ (9.Yuasa K. Omori K. Yanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4897-4905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several other PKG Iα-interacting proteins have been identified, but either binding of PKG Iβ was not tested (25.MacMillan-Crow L.A. Lincoln T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8035-8043Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26.Tang M. Wang G. Lu P. Karas R.H. Aronovitz M. Heximer S.P. Kaltenbronn K.M. Blumer K.J. Siderovski D.P. Zhu Y. Mendelsohn M.E. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1506-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) or the proteins bound to both PKG I isoforms without apparent specificity (18.Yuasa K. Michibata H. Omori K.

Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 275-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and we were unable to detect heterodimerization in experiments that were performed analogous to those described in Fig. 5.4 Binding of AKAPs to the N-terminal dimerization domain of the regulatory subunits of PKA has been extensively studied (3.Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Carr D.W. Westphal R. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In contrast to the proposed PKG Iα and Iβ leucine zipper domains mediating parallel homodimerization (5.Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 275-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), PKA regulatory subunits form an antiparallel dimer through an X-type four-helix bundle motif (28.Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Since the extreme N termini of PKAs and PKGs are so different, one cannot extrapolate from the structure of the PKA/AKAP interaction to the structure of the PKG I interaction motif. Presently, there are no published crystal structures for PKG I or any of its domains. However, similar to the Ht31 peptide that disrupts PKA anchoring (2.Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), inhibitory peptides that disrupt PKG Iα or Iβ anchoring can be devised to study the importance of kinase targeting for cGMP signaling. TFII-I and IRAG may function as scaffolding proteins in the center of multiprotein complexes and target PKG Iβ to phosphorylate not only TFII-I and IRAG but also other proteins in the complex (10.Casteel D.E.

However, whereas the physiological functions of TFII-I and IRAG have been studied in some detail, relatively little is known about the significance of the interaction between PKG Iβ and TFII-I or IRAG (10.Casteel D.E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32003-32014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and preliminary data suggest that the interaction between PKG Iβ and IRAG at the endoplasmic reticulum may be sufficient to prevent nuclear translocation of PKG Iβ and transcriptional regulation by the kinase. 5D. E. Casteel, T. Zhang, and R. B. Pilz, manuscript in preparation. In conclusion, our results begin to define the molecular mechanisms involved in PKG Iβ interaction with target proteins. Undoubtedly, the completion of structural studies that solve the solution or crystal structure of a PKG Iβ N-terminal fragment complexed with either an IRAG or TFII-I peptide will define the precise topology of the binding interface.

The TetR family is one of the major transcription factor families that regulate expression of genes involved in bacterial antimicrobial resistance systems. CGL2612 protein is a transcription factor newly identified by genomic DNA analysis on Corynebacterium glutamicum, which belongs to the mycolic acid-containing Actinomycetales, including the well known pathogens Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Crystal structure analysis showed that the CGL2612 protein exhibits significant structural similarity to the multidrug resistance (MDR)-related transcription factor QacR from Staphylococcus aureus, despite poor amino acid sequence similarity between these proteins. Binding DNA sequence analysis of CGL2612 protein using the systematic evolution of ligands by the exponential enrichment (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment, or SELEX) method revealed that this protein is a new member of the TetR family, which regulates expression of the immediately upstream gene, cgl2611, probably encoding a major facilitator superfamily permease. Subsequent functional analyses confirmed a function of the CGL2612 as a transcriptional repressor responsible for the antimicrobial resistance system in C. glutamicum. The strategy used in the present study is one of the most convenient and powerful methods to analyze functionally unknown transcription factors, and the results obtained here will contribute to our understanding of the drug resistance mechanism not only in C. glutamicum but also in the related bacteria, C. diphtheriae and M. tuberculosis.

Many kinds of antibiotics have been developed to control infectious diseases. However, bacteria have developed various ways to survive when faced with these agents. One such bacterial mechanism of antibiotic resistance involves membrane proteins that expel toxic compounds from the cells (1.Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 672-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Two types of efflux system are known: protein systems that transport a specific toxic compound or class of toxins out of the cell, such as tetracycline efflux pumps (2.Hillen W. Berens C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and those that transport numerous structurally dissimilar compounds. The latter type of transporter can actively export a wide range of compounds, and these are called multidrug transporters (1.Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 672-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Bacteria that acquire such transport systems can cancel the effects of many kinds of drugs (multidrug resistance (MDR) 3The abbreviations used are: MDR, multidrug resistance; SELEX, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment; MFS, major facilitator superfamily; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; RD, regulatory domain.; r.m.s., root mean square.). MDR has been shown to be widespread among both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (3.Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Roberts N.J. Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18665-18673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the emergence of such bacteria causes nosocomial infection and often has adverse effects on health. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the bacteria that often develop MDR and can cause serious clinical problems. The TetR family of transcriptional factors are known to regulate expression of genes involved in bacterial efflux systems against antimicrobial compounds or drugs (4.Aramaki H. Yagi N. Suzuki M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proteins that belong to this family are known to act as transcriptional repressors, and they bind constitutively to their regulatory sequence and repress expression of target genes that are related to drug detoxification or export. When the cellular level of toxic compounds increases, the repressor alters its DNA-binding ability and dissociates from the regulatory sequence, resulting in activation of antibiotic resistance of the bacterium. Corynebacterium glutamicum is widely used for industrial production of amino acids. The genome of the C. glutamicum wild-type strain ATCC13032 has been sequenced by Kyowa Hakko and is now available in the public domain. The well known pathogenic bacteria, Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are phylogenetically related to C. glutamicum. Analysis of C. glutamicum (3.3 Mbp), C. diphtheriae (2.5 Mbp), and M. tuberculosis (4.4 Mbp) genomes using the GTOP protein structure prediction data base (available on the World Wide Web at spock.genes.nig.ac.jp/~genome/gtop.html) (5.Kawabata T. Fukuchi S. Homma K. Ota M. Araki J. Ito T. Ichiyoshi N. Nishikawa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) indicated that these genomes encode 16, 12, and 43 proteins that possess the TetR-type DNA-binding domain, respectively, but most of their functions are still unknown. Structural and functional analyses of such novel TetR family proteins found by genomic analysis promote the elucidation of drug resistance mechanisms in these bacteria and contribute to reduction of the threat of MDR. Here, we report the crystal structure and biological function of CGL2612 protein (177 residues, 20.3 kDa) from C. glutamicum as a transcriptional repressor of a putative major facilitator superfamily (MFS) drug efflux pump responsible for increasing resistance to antibiotics in bacteria. The full-length (amino acids 1-177) cgl2612 gene was amplified by PCR using the C. glutamicum wild-type strain ATCC13032 genome as a template DNA and was inserted into the vector pET-26b (Novegen Inc., Madison, WI) into the NdeI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites. The 3′-end primer for cloning was designed for direct attachment of a His6 tag to the C-terminal end of CGL2612 protein via a two-amino acid linker, consisting of Leu and Glu (pET/CGL2612-His). The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-Star (DE3) host cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Protein expression and purification of both native and Se-Met-substituted proteins for crystallization experiments were performed using methods similar to those described previously (6.Itou H. Yao M. Watanabe N. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Crystallization experiments were performed using the same strategy as described previously (6.Itou H. Yao M. Watanabe N. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The best native crystal was obtained under the following conditions: 0.08 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.16 m MgCl2, 21% polyethylene glycol 400, and 20% glycerol. The dimensions of the crystal were 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.4 mm3, and this crystal belonged to the space group P212121 with cell dimensions of a = 56.9 Å, b = 67.0 Å, and c = 101.2 Å, and the asymmetric unit contained two molecules of CGL2612 protein. The crystal volume per protein mass (VM) (7.Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar) was 2.4 Å3 Da-1 with a solvent content of 48.3%. Se-Met-substituted crystals were also obtained under conditions similar to those used for the native crystals, and the best crystal was obtained under the following conditions: 0.08 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.16 m MgCl2, 23% polyethylene glycol 400, and 20% glycerol. The dimensions of the crystal were 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.4 mm3, and this crystal also belonged to the space group P212121 with cell dimensions of a = 58.2 Å, b = 67.9 Å, and c = 105.5 Å, and the asymmetric unit contained two molecules of CGL2612 protein.

Open table in a new tab Random SELEX Selection—To generate an initial random sequence DNA library, single-stranded 62-mer oligonucleotides (5′-CGGAATTCCGGTCGACCAGAAGN16TATGTGCGTCTACATGGATCCTCA-3′), containing a random core of 16 nucleotides, were constructed. Both ends (the first 22 nucleotides and the last 24 nucleotides) of the oligonucleotide were primer binding sites. A double-stranded oligonucleotide DNA pool was amplified by PCR using primers (primer PRS5′ and PRS3′) complementary to the 5′- and the 3′-primer binding sites, respectively. PCR amplification was performed with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan). The PCR products, a random sequence DNA library, were mixed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) preadsorbed with 50 μg of purified CGL2612 protein in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing of nonspecific binding sites with binding buffer, protein-DNA complexes were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole). DNA fragments were extracted from the eluted fraction by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Eluted fragments were amplified by PCR using the primers PRS5′ and PRS3′, and the PCR products were used as a DNA pool for the next cycle of selection. This process was repeated for a total of eight cycles. Selected DNA fragments after these cycles were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and the DNA sequences of their random core regions were analyzed. Genomic SELEX Selection—Chromosomal DNA of the C. glutamicum wild-type strain ATCC13032 was fragmented into short fragments (∼100-300 bp) by sonication (Astrason XL2020; Misonix Inc., Farmingdale, NY) on ice, and both ends of the fragments were blunted using DNA polymerase (DNA Blunting kit, Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan). The blunt-ended fragments were cloned into EcoRV-digested pBR322 (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) using T4 DNA ligase (Takara Bio), and transformed into E. coli XL-1 blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Forty-eight of the resulting clones were analyzed for the size and sequence of their insert fragments to verify randomness of the inserts required for use as a SELEX library template. Over 1.0 × 105 clones were collected for library preparation, and our library template had sufficient variety and length to cover the total genome of C. glutamicum. The DNA library for genomic SELEX experiments was generated by PCR from the template using primers PGS5′ (5′-CTTGGTTATGCCGGTACTGC-3′) and PGS3′ (5′-GCGATGCTGTCGGAATGGAC-3′), corresponding to sequences upstream and downstream of the EcoRV site in the pBR322 vector. PCR was performed using ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio). The experimental procedure for selection and sequencing steps were essentially the same as those of random SELEX experiments described above. The probes for DNase I footprinting experiments were prepared by PCR from C. glutamicum wild-type strain ATCC13032 genomic DNA using the specific primer pair PDF5′-PDF3′. These primers (PDF5′, 5′-AAGTGACCTCACAGAATCGC-3′; PDF3′, 5′-TGCGGTGTAGAGAATCGAGT-3′) were designed for 110 bp upstream and down-stream from positions -36 to -6 of the cgl2611 gene, respectively. Prior to PCR amplification, the 5′ termini of the primers of either the coding strand or the noncoding strand were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Bio). Aliquots of 120 ng of labeled probes, 10 μg of salmon testis DNA (Sigma), and 150 μg of purified CGL2612 protein were mixed in 20 μl of reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. After incubation, 0.25 units of DNase I (Takara Bio) in 0.5 μl of reaction buffer were added and mixed, and digestion was allowed to continue for 1 min at 37 °C. Digestion was terminated by the addition of phenol/chloroform, and reaction mixtures were extracted. DNA was precipitated with ethanol, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in 8 μl of loading dye. After heating at 90 °C for 1 min, aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis on an 8 m urea-containing 6% polyacrylamide gel. Sequence ladders were generated using a Thermo sequence cycle sequence kit (Amersham Biosciences) with the same primer as was end-labeled for probe preparation. For disruption of the cgl2612 gene, the C. glutamicum wild-type strain ATCC31831 was used. A 2.1-kb DNA fragment encompassing the cgl2612 gene was amplified by PCR using the primers, 5′-AGGAGCCACTTCTAGATCTGTCG-3′ and 5′-GGACATCACCTGCAGATGTCC-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with XbaI and PstI and then ligated with the vector plasmid pK18mobsacB (16.Schafer A. Tauch A. Jager W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Puhler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar) digested with XbaI-PstI. From the resulting plasmid, a 440-bp XhoI fragment encoding an internal part of cgl2612 was removed by XhoI digestion followed by self-ligation. The constructed plasmid, named pK18Δcgl2612, was introduced directly into ATCC31831 cells by electroporation, and kanamycin-resistant transformants were selected. As pK18Δcgl2612 did not have a replication origin functional in C. glutamicum cells, only cells in which homologous recombination occurred between the chromosomal DNA and plasmid DNA could grow on kanamycin-containing plates. The kanamycin-resistant transformants thus carried the intact cgl2612 gene and the deleted cgl2612 gene in addition to the vector plasmid sequence on their chromosome. One of the kanamycin-resistant transformants was grown in L liquid medium without kanamycin for 16 h, and the cells were then spread on sucrose-containing L agar plates (20% sucrose). As cells carrying the sacB gene encoded by the vector plasmid were killed in the presence of sucrose, only those cells in which the sacB gene was excised from the chromosome by the second homologous recombination between the intact and deleted cgl2612 could grow on sucrose-containing plates. The resultant sucrose-tolerant recombinants should have the wild-type or the deleted cgl2612 gene, depending on the recombination point. Among sucrose-tolerant recombinants, the desired deletion mutant strain was selected by PCR amplification with the primers used for cloning of the cgl2612 gene. Chromosomal deletion of cgl2612 was further confirmed by Southern hybridization (data not shown). The constructed deletion mutant strain was named D2612. The transcriptional initiation site of the cgl2611 gene was determined by primer extension analysis. Total cellular RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells of ATCC31831 or D2612 using an RNA isolation kit (RNeasy, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Aliquots of 40 μg of total RNA were used for primer extension with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and the biotinylated oligonucleotide (5′-AGAAAGAGACCACCGCTGATAACGC-3′), which was complementary to a region within cgl2611. The primer extension products were separated on an 8 m urea-containing gel together with the sequencing ladders obtained using the same primer. Separated products were detected by chemiluminescence using a Phototope-Star detection kit (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a standard 2-fold serial dilution format on L agar plates. Aliquots of 10 μl of stationary culture diluted in 0.85% NaCl to 106 cells/ml were spotted onto each plate. Following incubation at 30 °C for 24 h, the MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that resulted in >99.9% inhibition of colony formation. Overall Structure—A view of the overall structure of the CGL2612 dimer is shown in Fig. 1. Atomic models were successively built for each subunit (subunit A, Met1-Ser175; subunit B, Thr3-Pro174). The subunit was composed of nine helices (α1, Lys5-Glu19; α2, Tyr27-Thr34; α3 Lys38-His44; α4 Arg48-Ile70; α5, Pro77-Leu88; α6, Arg94-Ser105; α7, Pro107-Trp120; α8, Leu127-Tyr151; α9, Lys159-Glu171). In both native and Se-Met-substituted crystals, two subunits in the asymmetric unit were found to exist as a dimer. The N-terminal three helices of CGL2612 protein form a compact DNA-binding domain that contains the typical helix-turn-helix motif (α2-α3), in which the latter helix was assumed to be a DNA recognition helix. The C-terminal portion of this protein consists of six helices and was assumed to act as a regulatory domain (RD). CGL2612 subunits form stable dimers related by 2-fold symmetry with this domain. C-terminal helices α8 and α9 from each subunit form a helix bundle structure, and hydrophobic interactions among residues in this bundle mainly take part in stabilization of the dimer. The RD and N-terminal DNA-binding domain of CGL2612 are connected by the α4 helix, and these two domains are associated with each other through a common hydrophobic internal core. Residues located at the edge of the hydrophobic core formed in the DNA-binding domain (Ile9, Leu10, and Ala13 in the α1 helix and Leu22 and Leu25 in the α2 helix) also participate in hydrophobic interaction with hydrophobic residues from RD (α4 and α6 helices). In addition to these hydrophobic interactions, a salt bridge was also observed between these domains (Arg11 in α1 and Asp62 in α4 helix). Comparison with Other TetR Family Proteins—DALI structural similarity search (17.Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) revealed that the overall structure of CGL2612 protein was similar to those of the TetR family proteins. Structural homologs of CGL2612 were EthR (Protein Data Bank number 1t56: z-score = 11.7, root mean square differences = 3.6 Å for 162 Cα atoms; Protein Data Bank number 1u9n: z-score = 11.0, r.m.s. deviation = 4.0 Å for 160 Cα atoms) (18.Dover L.G.

Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This confirmed that the CGL2612 protein also belongs to the same family of proteins. The amino acid sequences of CGL2612 and its homologous proteins from the related bacteria, C. diphtheriae and M. tuberculosis, are aligned in Fig. 2 (16-30% identity). As shown in the figure, DNA-binding domains of these proteins are well conserved and exhibit 24-61% identities in their primary structures. In particular, the residues around α3, a putative DNA recognition helix, are highly conserved. These conserved residues have already been shown to participate in the interaction with DNA molecules in DNA-protein complex structures of the other TetR family proteins, QacR (Protein Data Bank number 1jt0) (20.Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1210-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and TetR (Protein Data Bank number 1qpi) (23.Orth P. Schnappinger D. Hillen W. Saenger W. Hinrichs W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, residues marked D), and residues that may be involved in DNA-protein interactions in CGL2612 and its homologues can also be predicted (Fig. 2, residues marked d). TetR family proteins are transcriptional repressors, and there are ligand molecules that induce dissociation of proteins from their conjugate DNA. Tertiary structures of related proteins showed that TetR family proteins commonly possess cavities in their RDs (18.Dover L.G. Corsino P.E. Daniels I.R. Cocklin S.L. Tatituri V. Besra G.S.

The present structure of CGL2612 protein indicated that there is also a deep cavity in its RD, and the cavity is assumed to act as an inducer-binding site in this protein. This tentative binding site has two openings to bulk solvent in subunit A; one opening is framed by the helices α4, α5, and α6, whereas the other is framed by helices α6 and α7 and the α8-α9 loop from another subunit (Fig. 3a). Around the latter opening, the α8-α9 loop covers the entrance of the cavity and narrows its opening. Main chain trajectories of subunits A and B are slightly different from each other (r.m.s. deviation for residues 3-174 is 1.000 Å). Especially, in subunit B, the main-chain trajectory of the α8-α9 loop and α9 helix is different from another subunit, and the latter opening is closed by the loop (Fig. 3b). This suggests that the corresponding region is rather flexible, and the former larger opening is likely to work as an inducer entrance of this cavity. The interior of the inducer-binding site of CGL2612 is surrounded by residues, Leu59, Trp63, and Glu66 in"
https://openalex.org/W2037291667,"In mammals, male sex determination is controlled by the SRY protein, which drives differentiation of the bipotential embryonic gonads into testes by activating the Sertoli cell differentiation program. The morphological effects of SRY are well documented; however, its molecular mechanism of action remains unknown. Moreover, SRY proteins display high sequence variability among mammalian species, which makes protein motifs difficult to delineate. We previously isolated SIP-1/NHERF2 as a human SRY-interacting protein. SIP-1/NHERF2, a PDZ protein, interacts with the C-terminal extremity of the human SRY protein. Here we showed that the interaction of SIP-1/NHERF2 and SRY via the SIP-1/NHERF2 PDZ1 domain is conserved in mice. However, the interaction occurs via a domain that is internal to the mouse SRY protein and involves a different recognition mechanism than human SRY. Furthermore, we show that mouse and human SRY induce nuclear accumulation of the SIP-1/NHERF2 protein in cultured cells. Finally, a transgenic mouse line expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the mouse Sry promoter allowed us to show that SRY and SIP-1/NHERF2 are co-expressed in the nucleus of pre-Sertoli cells during testis determination. Taken together, our results suggested that the function of SIP-1/NHERF2 as an SRY cofactor during testis determination is conserved between human and mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1965825929,"Alternative splicing of signaling proteins can contribute to the complexity of signaling networks. We find that expression of mouse RON, but not human RON, results in constitutive receptor autophosphorylation, ligand-independent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and association of the receptor with c-Src. Using chimeric receptors, we mapped the region for this difference in signaling capacity of mouse and human RON to the juxtamembrane domain. Expression of these receptors in primary erythroid progenitor cells also demonstrated a functional difference in the ability of mouse and human RON to support erythropoietin-independent colony formation that mapped to the juxtamembrane domain. Splicing of the mouse RON receptor tyrosine kinase transcript results in the constitutive deletion of an exon used by all other known RON orthologs that encodes part of the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor. Mutational analysis indicated that the two tyrosines present in this region in human RON, one of which has been previously shown to be a c-Cbl binding site, are not responsible for this difference. However, deletion of this region in the context of human RON enhanced receptor phosphorylation, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, and association of c-Src at levels comparable with those observed with mouse RON. These data provide direct evidence that the divergence of exon usage among different species can generate a protein with novel activity and subsequently add to the complexity of cellular signaling regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1971464225,"We examined the relative affinity of model promoter constructs for binding <i>Escherichia coli</i> RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme. Model promoter constructs were designed to mimic DNA structures characteristic for different steps of transcription initiation. DNA duplexes in which a chemical cross-link was introduced just downstream from –10 hexamer to prevent DNA melting upon RNAP binding were used to mimic RNAP-promoter contacts in a closed complex. Fork junction DNA molecules with double-stranded/single-stranded junction between –11 and –10 position were used to study interactions of RNA polymerase with DNA in open complex. The –35 and –10 promoter regions were found to be equally important for the initial RNAP binding. The recognition of –35 promoter region was independent of structural context of the model promoter fragment. In contrast, free energy of RNAP binding to –10 hexamer was highly dependent on DNA structure. The relative importance of –10 region for sequence-specific interaction with the polymerase was the lowest for constructs mimicking closed complex and the highest for the constructs mimicking open complex. The relative importance of region –10 was also dependent on the presence of –35 consensus element indicating a communication between different DNA binding determinants of polymerase during open complex formation. Short double-stranded promoter fragments comprising only –35 and –10 or only –10 consensus elements underwent melting in a complex with polymerase indicating that the core of promoter melting activity of the polymerase is localized to a very small subset of all promoter-polymerase contacts."
https://openalex.org/W1996795653,"Polytopic proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by ribosomes docked at the Sec61 translocation channel. It is generally assumed that, upon termination of translation, polypeptides are spontaneously released into the ER membrane where final stages of folding and assembly are completed. Here we investigate early interactions between the ribosome-translocon complex and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a multidomain ABC transporter, and demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using in vitro and Xenopus oocyte expression systems we show that, during and immediately following synthesis, nascent CFTR polypeptides associate with large, heterogeneous, and dynamic protein complexes. Partial-length precursors were quantitatively isolated in a non-covalent, puromycin-sensitive complex (>3,500 kDa) that contained the Sec61 ER translocation machinery and the cytosolic chaperone Hsc70. Following the completion of synthesis, CFTR was gradually released into a smaller (600-800 kDa) ATP-sensitive complex. Surprisingly, release of full-length CFTR from the ribosome and translocon was significantly delayed after translation was completed. Moreover, this step required both nucleotide triphosphates and cytosol. Release of control proteins varied depending on their size and domain complexity. These studies thus identify a novel energy-dependent step early in the CFTR maturation pathway that is required to disengage nascent CFTR from ER biosynthetic machinery. We propose that, contrary to current models, the final stage of membrane integration is a regulated process that can be influenced by the state of nascent chain folding, and we speculate that this step is influenced by the complex multidomain structure of CFTR."
https://openalex.org/W2072273888,"The rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin in pineal glands is controlled by the periodic release of norepinephrine from the superior cervical ganglion. Norepinephrine binds to the β-adrenergic receptor and stimulates an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, leading to the transcriptional activation of serotonin N-acetyltransferase, which in turn promotes melatonin production. In the present study, we report that bradykinin inhibits basal- and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, norepinephrine-induced cAMP generation, and N-acetyltransferase expression in a calcium-dependent manner. These effects were blocked by pretreatment with U73122 (a selective phospholipase C inhibitor), and 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (a Ca2+ chelator), but not pertussis toxin. The calcium ionophore, ionomycin, inhibited isoproterenol-mediated cAMP generation, similar to bradykinin. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of bradykinin was evident only during the daytime. At midday, bradykinin inhibited the cAMP level by ∼50% but markedly stimulated cAMP production (by ∼50%) at night. Northern blotting and immunoblotting data disclosed circadian expression of calcium-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase type 6.

Nature. 1993; 365: 299-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C additionally stabilizes the AANAT protein via phosphorylation (8.Choi B.H. Chae H.D. Park T.J. Oh J.S. Lim J.K. Kang S.S. Ha H.J. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that multiple receptors for amino acids, neuropeptides, and biogenic amines other than norepinephrine present on pinealocytes participate in the modulation of melatonin synthesis (9.Simonneaux V. Ribelayga C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 325-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, to date, no studies have established the presence of BK receptors on pinealocytes. BK, a nonapeptide hormone, is generated from the high molecular weight precursor, kininogen, by the proteolytic action of kallikrein and functions as a potent mediator of inflammation, pain, asthma, and hypertension (10.Steranka L.R. Manning D.C. DeHaas C.J. Ferkany J.W. Borosky S.A. Connor J.R. Vavrek R.J. Stewart J.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The kallikrein-kinin system has been identified in the mammalian nervous system (12.Perry D.C. Snyder S.H. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 1072-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13.Kizuki K. Suzuki T. Kudo M. Noguchi T. Brain Res. 1994; 634: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, kallikrein mRNA and enzyme activity are higher in the rat pineal gland than other brain regions (14.Chao J. Chao L. Swain C.C. Tsai J. Margolius H.S. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15.Fujieda H. Sato T. Wake K. Takaoka M. Morimoto S. J. Pineal. Res. 1993; 14: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, immunoelectron microscopy data by Kudo et al. (16.Kudo M. Yamazaki I. Suzuki T. Ebihara Y. Iwadate H. Kizuki K. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) disclosed that kallikrein is localized in perivascular spaces in the rat pineal gland. However, the functional role of the kallikrein-kinin system in rat pineal glands is currently unclear. A number of earlier investigations reported that BK inhibits β-adrenergic receptor-mediated cAMP accumulation in various cell types (17.DeBernardi M.A. Seki T. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18.Boyajian C.L. Garritsen A. Cooper D.M. J. Biol.

Moreover, Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase (AC) is involved in the BK-induced inhibition mechanism, because stimulation of the BK receptor leads to increased [Ca2+]i. To date, at least nine isoforms of AC have been cloned and characterized in mammals (20.Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Among these, types V and VI constitute a subfamily defined as Ca2+-inhibitable. Here, we report that the treatment of rat pinealocytes with BK results in [Ca2+]i increase and diurnal inhibition of pineal AC activity. Inhibition of β-adrenergic receptor-mediated cAMP generation and AANAT expression by BK is mediated by direct suppression of Ca2+-inhibitable AC type VI (AC6). Additionally, the expression patterns of AC6 mRNA and protein follow a diurnal rhythm.

Belgium). Anti-rat AANATp22–37 sera 2500 and 3352, anti-rat AANAT25–200 serum 3314, and purified rat AANAT protein were kindly supplied by Dr. David C. Klein (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Animals—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) were obtained from Hyochang Science (Seoul, Korea). Rats were maintained under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (LD12:12) with lights off at 7:00 pm for at least 1 week before the day of the experiment. Rat Pinealocyte Culture—Pinealocytes were isolated from the pineal glands of male Sprague-Dawley rats (150 g, Hyochang Science) at postnatal week 6. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were decapitated, and pineal glands were washed with ice-cold Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4). Glands were dissected into small sections and treated with 0.1% collagenase solution (2 mg/ml collagenase type V in Locke's solution, Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min with gentle shaking. This was followed by treatment with 0.025% trypsin solution (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 15 min, and centrifugation at 180 × g for 5 min. Dispersed pinealocytes were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) antibiotics comprising 5000 units/ml penicillin G (sodium) and 5000 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in 0.85% saline (Invitrogen), pH 7.4. Pinealocytes were placed in coverslips or culture dishes coated with poly-l-lysine, and maintained in the above medium in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Single-cell Ca2+ Imaging—Intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured by fluorescence ratio imaging of the Ca2+ indicator dye, Fura-2. Briefly, pinealocyte-attached coverslips were transferred to a 35-mm culture dish containing prewarmed medium. After 10 min, the medium was replaced with 1.5 ml of the same culture medium containing 3 μm Fura-2/AM dissolved in Me2SO, and incubated for 1 h. Coverslips were rinsed twice with 1 ml of medium, placed in a perfusion chamber, and perfused with imaging buffer (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 5.0 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Rat pinealocytes were imaged using the ImageMaster system (Photon Technology International). The average Ca2+ level in individual rat pinealocytes was determined from the ratio of fluorescence emissions obtained using two different excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm). Measurement of IP3—The IP3 concentration in cells was determined using a competition assay with [3H]IP3, as described previously (21.Lee H. Choi B.H. Suh B.C. Lee S.K. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In brief, pinealocytes were stimulated as indicated, and the reaction was terminated by aspirating medium off the cells, followed by the addition of 5% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing 4 mm EGTA. Samples were left on ice for 30 min to extract water-soluble inositol phosphates. Samples were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and trichloroacetic acid was removed by extraction with diethyl ether four times. The final preparation was neutralized with 200 mm Trizma base, and the pH was adjusted to ∼7.4. Assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm EGTA, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), [3H]IP3 (0.1 Ci/ml), and IP3-binding protein were added to cell extracts. The mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Scintillation mixture was added to the pellet to measure radioactivity. The IP3 concentration was determined using a standard curve. IP3-binding protein was prepared from bovine adrenal cortex according to the method of Challiss et al. (22.Challiss R.A. Chilvers E.R. Willcocks A.L. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Quantitation of cAMP—The cAMP concentration in rat pineal glands was determined using the [3H]cAMP competition assay for evaluating interactions with cAMP-binding protein (23.Hur E.M. Park Y.S. Huh Y.H. Yoo S.H. Woo K.C. Choi B.H. Kim K.T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Rats were decapitated at midday (12:00), and glands were placed directly into ice-cold DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. After the removal of extraneous tissue, glands were placed on nylon mesh that rested on DMEM medium, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 1 h before the experiment. Glands were stimulated with agonists for 3 min at 37 °C and transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 200 μl of absolute ethanol for termination of the reaction. This was followed by incubation for 2 h at –20 °C to extract cAMP. Glands in ethanol were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged with 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac (Savant instruments, Farmingdale, NY). Residues were dissolved in 0.2 ml of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 4 mm EDTA. Sample solution (50 μl) was employed in the cAMP assay. The assay is based on competition between [3H]cAMP and unlabeled cAMP in the sample for crude cAMP-binding protein prepared from bovine adrenal cortex according to the method of Brown et al. (24.Brown B.L. Albano J.D. Ekins R.P. Sgherzi A.M. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Free [3H]cAMP was adsorbed using charcoal and removed by centrifugation, and bound [3H]cAMP in the supernatant was measured by liquid scintillation. Each unknown sample was incubated with 50 μlof[3H]cAMP (5 μCi/ml) and 100 μl of binding protein for 2 h at 4°C. Separation of protein-bound cAMP from unbound cAMP was achieved by adsorption of free cAMP onto charcoal (100 μl), followed by centrifugation (12,000 × g)at4°C. Supernatant fractions (200 μl) were placed in Eppendorf tubes containing 1.2 ml of scintillation mixture to measure radioactivity. The cAMP concentrations in samples were determined using a standard curve and expressed as picomoles/gland. AANAT Activity Assay—AANAT activity was measured as described previously (25.Chae H.D. Park T.J. Lee T.G. Kim K.T. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 35: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were decapitated at midday (12:00), and pineal glands were placed directly into ice-cold DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. After the removal of extraneous tissue, pineal glands were placed on nylon mesh that rested on DMEM medium, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 1 h before the experiment. Following stimulation, rat pineal glands were individually disrupted by ultrasound in 100 μl of ice-cold phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.8). Debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and stored at –80 °C until use. An amount (8 μl or indicated volumes) of the supernatant was incubated in the presence of 5 μl of tryptamine-HCl (10 mm), 1 μl of acetyl CoA (0.5 mm), and 1 μlof[3H]acetyl CoA (3.6 Ci/mmol, 250 μCi/ml). Phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.8) was added to obtain a final volume of 20 μl. Incubation was performed at 37 °C for 30 min, and the was reaction terminated by dilution with an additional 180 μl of ice-cold phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.8). Econofluor was rapidly added to the whole diluted reaction mixture, and after incubation for 15 min, the amount of radiolabeled acetyltryptamine was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from rat pineal glands with the TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). First-strand cDNA was synthesized for 90 min at 42 °C in the presence of 1 mm of each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Invitrogen) and Superscript II (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified with 10 pmol of primers (Bioneer, Korea) specific for each AC isoform, using ExTaq polymerase (Takara, Japan). The primers of AC isoforms were selected from published cDNA sequences (26.Manolopoulos V.G. Liu J. Unsworth B.R. Lelkes P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27.Emala C.W. Kumasaka D. Hirshman C.A. Lindeman K.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), including AC type I, 5′-AGCACTTCCTAATGTCCAACCCT-3′ and 5′-AGCACTTCCTAATGTCCAACCCT-3′; AC type II, 5′-CGTGTCACTCTCCATATTC-3′ and 5′-CCTTGTTCACATCTGACTC-3′; AC type III, 5′-CATCGAGTGTCTACGCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGATGACCTGTGTCTCTTCT-3′; AC type IV, 5′-TTCTTCACACTCCTCGTCC-3′ and 5′-CGTCCTTGTTGTGTGTCCTG-3′; AC type V, 5′-ATCGAGCTCATCTACGTGC-3′ and 5′-AGCATGCAGATACAGAGCC-3′; AC type VI, 5′-CTGCTTGTGTTCATCTCTG-3′ and 5′-GACGCTAAGCACTAGATCA-3′; AC type VII, 5′-CCAGTTATTTAGAGAGAGACCTG-3′ and 5′-CTTGCTCATCAGGGCCATGCTAA-3′; AC type VIII, 5′-GGACAGCAGCTGGAGTACACAGC-3′ and 5′-CCTGATCCTTCAGGATGAGATAG-3′; AC type IX, 5′-AGCTTATCCTCACCTTCTTCTTCCTC-3′ and 5′-AGGACACGGTAGCACTCCTTGCC-3′. The reaction was performed for 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 48 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min with a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. The specificities of amplified cDNA fragments were confirmed by sequence analysis. Northern Blotting—Total RNA (15 μg) was resolved on 1% (w/v) agarose gels containing 0.66 m formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes (ICN, East Hills, NY). Blots were hybridized to rat AC type VI probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer extension method. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C in solution containing 10% polyethylene glycol, 7% SDS, 10 mm EGTA, 250 mm NaCl, 85 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.2), denatured salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml), and radiolabeled probe (5 × 105 cpm/ml). After hybridization, blots were briefly washed twice with 1× saline sodium citrate (SSC: 300 mm NaCl and 30 mm sodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature, three times with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and twice with 0.1× SSC at room temperature. Blots were reprobed with rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA as a control. Immunoblotting—Proteins from pineal glands prepared at indicated times were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 mm, Bio-Rad), as described previously (28.Wicht H. Maronde E. Olcese J. Korf H.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with the AC5/6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or AANAT antibody (serum 2500, 1:30,000 dilution, a kind gift from Dr. D. C. Klein, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Signals were detected with the ECL detection system. Statistical Analysis—All quantitative data are presented as means ± S.E. of a minimum of three experiments. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed via t test, and values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Following perfusion of pinealocytes with 100 nm BK, [Ca2+]i increased transiently in 90% of the cell population. Serial perfusion of 100 nm BK, 1 μm 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP), 1 μm phenylephrine, and 70 mm KCl (High K+), which are known [Ca2+]i-mobilizing agents in rat pinealocytes (29.Marin A. Urena J. Tabares L. J. Pineal. Res. 1996; 21: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30.Yamada H. Yamamoto A. Takahashi M. Michibata H. Kumon H. Moriyama Y. J. Pineal. Res. 1996; 21: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), led to transient elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1A). These responses correlate with the typical characteristics of rat pinealocytes. BK triggered an increase in [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The concentration dependence curve discloses maximal and half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values for BK of 1 μm and 50 nm, respectively. The B1 BK receptor-specific agonist, [des-Arg10]kallidin (DAK), had little effect on [Ca2+]i mobilization (Fig. 2A). To further define the subtype of BK receptor involved, cells were perfused with specific BK antagonists. Fig. 2B depicts the responses of BK-induced [Ca2+]i increase in the presence of [des-Arg10]HOE140 (dHOE140) and HOE140, B1 and B2 BK receptor specific antagonists, respectively. Pretreatment with HOE140 completely eliminated the BK-induced [Ca2+]i increase. In contrast, dHOE140 had little inhibitory effect on BK-induced [Ca2+]i mobilization. The antagonists themselves had no effects on [Ca2+]i increase.FIGURE 2Effects of BK and BK analogs on [Ca2+]i and IP3 production in rat pinealocytes. A, traces of the Fura-2/AM fluorescence ratio signifying the [Ca2+]i transients evoked by 100 nm BK and 100 nm DAK for the indicated times, represented by bars. B, inhibition of BK-induced [Ca2+]i transients by BK receptor antagonists from a single rat pinealocyte. Prior to the addition of 100 nm BK, HOE140 and dHOE140 (100 nm each, BK receptor antagonists) were preincubated with Fura-2/AM-loaded rat pinealocytes for the indicated times represented by bars. C, the left panel displays IP3 production, following treatment with BK and DAK (100 nm each) for 30 s. The right panel shows that BK-induced IP3 production was inhibited by pretreatment with the BK receptor antagonists, HOE140 and dHOE140. Rat pinealocytes were treated with the indicated BK receptor antagonists (100 nm each) for 10 min, and cells were stimulated with 100 nm BK for 1 min. The IP3 concentration was determined from cells. Data are presented as means ± S.E. (bars) values from three individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In view of the finding that IP3 induces Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores through specific receptors, we measured the IP3 generated as a result of BK treatment. Fig. 2C shows that BK treatment stimulated IP3 generation, whereas DAK, a B1 BK receptor-specific agonist, had little effect. Antagonists of BK receptors had similar effects on IP3 generation, as evident from [Ca2+]i mobilization data. HOE140, a B2 BK receptor-specific antagonist, blocked BK-induced IP3 generation. In contrast, dHOE140, a B1 BK receptor-specific antagonist, did not affect BK-induced IP3 generation. The results collectively indicate that phospholipase C (PLC)-linked BK receptors exist in rat pinealocytes, and the subtype of BK receptors expressed in rat pinealocytes is B2. To elucidate the physiological roles of BK, we focused on its effect on β-adrenergic receptor signaling, the major pathway of melatonin synthesis. Previous studies have shown that [Ca2+]i increase potentiates the effects of β-adrenergic stimulation in pineal glands (31.Sugden A.L. Sugden D. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11608-11612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Yu L. Schaad N.C. Klein D.C. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1436-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, BK-mediated modulation of β-adrenergic receptor signaling was distinct from the well established concept of Ca2+ signaling on melatonin synthesis. BK differentially modulates β-adrenergic signaling according to the circadian time. At ZT05, isoproterenol-induced cAMP generation was inhibited by about 30% by BK (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, at ZT17, isoproterenol-induced cAMP generation was increased 1.8-fold in the presence of BK (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, forskolin-induced AC activity was differentially regulated by BK, dependent on the time of day. At ZT05, co-treatment with BK resulted in about 50% inhibition of forskolin-stimulated AC activity (Fig. 3A), whereas at ZT17, BK enhanced forskolin-stimulated AC activity by about 1.5-fold (Fig. 3B). Additionally, differential regulation of basal pineal AC activity by BK was observed. At ZT05, BK inhibited basal AC activity about 80%, whereas at ZT17, enzyme activity was stimulated ∼20-fold (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that BK diurnally inhibits β-adrenergic receptor signaling through suppression of AC activity. Because Ca2+-mediated potentiation of β-adrenergic stimulation in pineal glands is a well known concept, we focused on the opposing inhibitory effect of BK on β-adrenergic signaling during the daytime. Co-treatment with BK resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition of isoproterenol-induced cAMP generation (Fig. 4A) and forskolin-stimulated AC activation (Fig. 4B) in rat pineal glands. Furthermore, concentration-dependent blockage of isoproterenol-induced AANAT activation (Fig. 4C) was also observed in rat pineal glands. All the above experiments were conducted with rat pineal glands excised at ZT05. The results indicate that BK acts as a negative regulator of melatonin synthesis at daytime through direct inhibition of AC. We further investigated the mechanism of BK signaling that inhibits β-adrenergic receptor-mediated cAMP generation (TABLE ONE). To confirm the hypothesis that BK-evoked inhibition of β-adrenergic signaling is mediated through a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein), such as Gi/o, rat pineal glands were preincubated with 300 ng/ml PTX, which uncouples the Gi/o protein from its receptor by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of the αi/o subunit, for 6 h. PTX had no effect on BK-specific inhibition of isoproterenol-mediated cAMP generation. Because the B2 BK receptor generally links to PLC through Gq protein (33.Hall J.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 56: 131-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), we additionally evaluated whether PLC-mediated [Ca2+]i rise contributes to the inhibitory effect of BK. U73122, a PLC inhibitor, completely reversed BK-induced suppression of isoproterenol-mediated cAMP generation. Next, we examined the possibility that BK-specific inhibition of cAMP production in rat pineal glands was due to the downstream event of PLC activation. Intact rat pineal glands were preincubated with 20 μm BAPTA/AM, a cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator, to block the [Ca2+]i increase. As shown in TABLE ONE, inhibition of cAMP generation by BK was completely reversed following pretreatment with BAPTA/AM. In addition, treatment of rat pineal glands with ionomycin (200 nm) led to blockage of isoproterenol-mediated cAMP generation. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of BK on isoproterenol-induced cAMP generation in rat pineal glands is due to the direct effect of [Ca2+]i increase on pineal AC.TABLE ONEInvolvement of the [Ca2+]i in BK-specific inhibition of β-adrenergic signaling in rat pineal glandsDrug treatedcAMP generation% of controlExperiment 1Control100.0 ± 6.3BK63.0 ± 1.8BK plus PTX57.2 ± 5.4BK plus U7312290.1 ± 4.6BK plus BAPTA94.9 ± 5.3Experiment 2Control100.0 ± 2.9BK58.7 ± 9.4Ionomycin52.2 ± 7.2 Open table in a new tab To explain the differential modulation of β-adrenergic signaling by BK, which are dependent on the time of day, we hypothesize that “Ca2+-inhibitable” AC proteins are present in the pineal gland with expression patterns following circadian rhythms. To verify this theory, the expression of AC isoforms in rat pineal glands was examined by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. PCR primer sets specific for known rat AC genes were selected from the reported cDNA sequences (26.Manolopoulos V.G. Liu J. Unsworth B.R. Lelkes P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Approximately 25% of circulating blood glucose and 20% of consumed oxygen is utilized by the brain, an organ that constitutes less than 2% of the human body mass (1.Wilson J.E. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1980; 16: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although four isozymes of hexokinase (ATP:d-hexose 6-phosphotransferase (2.7.1.1)) are present in mammals, brain tissue contains only a single isozyme, hexokinase I (HKI) 2The abbreviations used are: HKI, hexokinase type-I; Glu-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; AnGlu-6-P, 1,5-anhydroglucitol 6-phosphate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.2The abbreviations used are: HKI, hexokinase type-I; Glu-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; AnGlu-6-P, 1,5-anhydroglucitol 6-phosphate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.

HKI is arguably the “pacemaker of glycolysis” in the brain and red blood cell (5.Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 31-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, its mechanism of action and its molecular regulation is of overriding significance. Glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) is not only a potent inhibitor of HKI at physiological concentrations, but it can release HKI from brain mitochondria (6.Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1635-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HKI-release function of Glu-6-P may be the first step in an enzyme degradation pathway (6.Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1635-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and/or a process linked to apoptosis (7.Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N.

Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Structure. 1998; 6: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but an engineered mutant HKI crystallizes as a monomer, adopting a conformation similar to that of the subunit of the dimer (14.Aleshin A.E.

Hexokinase associated with the mitochondrial membrane may be a mixture of monomeric and tetrameric states (6.Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1635-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Xie G. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and possibly in one or both of these states, HKI could be associated with mitochondrial porin (16.Xie G. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The enzyme is strongly inhibited by one of its reaction products, Glu-6-P, and this inhibition can be reversed by physiological concentrations of inorganic orthophosphate (6.Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1635-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, HKI may be inhibited 95-98% in vivo (5.Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 31-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial association requires the first 15 amino acid residues at the N terminus of HKI. These residues are hydrophobic or without formal electrostatic charge, and could adopt a helical conformation (6.Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1635-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Lindén M. Gellerfors P. Nelson R.D. FEBS Lett. 1982; 141: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18.Fieck C.

Mitochondrial association gives HKI a competitive advantage relative to cytosolic transphosphorylases for mitochondrially synthesized ATP (13.Aleshin A.E. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is now known that HKI binds to the mitochondrion in proximity to porin and the translocator protein responsible for the ADP/ATP transport (6.Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1635-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Lindén M. Gellerfors P. Nelson R.D. FEBS Lett. 1982; 141: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18.Fieck C. Benz R. Roos N. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).The mechanism of Glu-6-P regulation of HKI has been a focal point of research from our laboratory since 1962 (20.Fromm H.J. Zewe V. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1661-1667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1951, Weil-Mahlerbe and Bone (21.Weil-Malherbe H. Bone A.D. Biochem. J. 1951; 49: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) reported Glu-6-P as a noncompetitive inhibitor of ATP (21.Weil-Malherbe H. Bone A.D. Biochem. J. 1951; 49: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the basis of fundamental differences in the HKI recognition of glucose and Glu-6-P analogs, Crane and Sols (22.Crane R.K. Sols A. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 210: 597-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded Glu-6-P acted as an allosteric inhibitor. In 1962, Fromm and Zewe (20.Fromm H.J. Zewe V. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1661-1667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that Glu-6-P is, in fact, a competitive inhibitor of ATP and linear noncompetitive inhibitor of glucose, a finding subsequently confirmed by a number of investigators (3.Grossbard L. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3546-3560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Bachelard H.S. Clark A.G. Thompson M.F. Biochem.

Easterby J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 566: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Glu-6-P, acting as an allosteric inhibitor, is not in conflict with kinetics. Indeed, competitive inhibition merely demands mutual exclusivity in the binding of inhibitor and substrate to HKI (28.Fromm H.J. Veneziale C.M. The Regulation of Carbohydrate Formation and Utilization in Mammals. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1981: 45-68Google Scholar).Problems in understanding the mechanism of Glu-6-P regulation of HKI have arisen over apparent contradictions regarding the number of Glu-6-P binding sites and their location. Equilibrium binding experiments from several groups show but one high affinity binding site for Glu-6-P on HKI, and yet all relevant crystal structures of HKI reveal bound molecules of Glu-6-P and glucose at the N- and C-terminal halves of the enzyme (12.Aleshin A.

Wilson J.E. Mulichak A. Garavito R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), a proponent of an inhibitory site for Glu-6-P at the N-terminal half, was among the first to show Glu-6-P inhibition of the truncated C-terminal half of HKI (34.White T.K. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 375-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Data from several groups are in agreement: the kinetics of Glu-6-P inhibition of the truncated enzyme (C-terminal half) are virtually identical to those of full-length HKI. Several mutations in the Glu-6-P binding site in the N-terminal half of HKI eliminated Pi relief of Glu-6-P inhibition, but had no effect on Glu-6-P inhibition (35.Fang T.Y. Alechina O. Alechin A.E. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19548-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mutations of the Glu-6-P binding site in the C-half of HKI, however, also had no effect on Glu-6-P inhibition; only mutations at both Glu-6-P-binding sites resulted in the loss of inhibition (36.Liu X. Kim C.S. Kurbanov F.T. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31155-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To reconcile these observations, Liu et al. (36.Liu X. Kim C.S. Kurbanov F.T. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31155-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) suggested a coupling mechanism between the N- and C-terminal halves of HKI that mediate antagonistic interactions between the two Glu-6-P binding sites. Different functional contexts for HKI (as a monomer in solution, and quite possibly both a monomer and an oligomer on the mitochondrion) may favor different inhibitory mechanisms.In addition to its role as a potent inhibitor of HKI, Glu-6-P is also capable of releasing mitochondrial-bound HKI (6.Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1635-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism responsible for the release of HKI by Glu-6-P is unknown; however, it may be related to the conformational state of HKI observed with bound Glu-6-P (37.Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 159: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In particular, we were interested in the extent to which each Glu-6-P binding site participates in the release of HKI from the mitochondrion. To address this issue, we prepared mutants of HKI in which the two Glu-6-P binding loci were modified to preclude Glu-6-P binding. The results here show unequivocally that Glu-6-P binding to the N-terminal half is responsible for the release of recombinant human HKI from the mitochondrion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—ATP, NADP, Glu-6-P, glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, deoxyribonuclease (DNase I), leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma. Kanamycin sulfate was purchased from Invitrogen. DEAE HPLC resin was a product of Tosohaas. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin and Rosetta (DE3) competent cells were from Novagen. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was from Anatrace. The HKI inhibitor, 1,5-anhydroglucitol 6-phosphate (AnGlu-6-P), was available from a previous study (36.Liu X. Kim C.S. Kurbanov F.T. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31155-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed at the Iowa State University DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility.Construction of Wild-type Hexokinase and Mutant Plasmids—Full-length human brain hexokinase had been cloned into pET-11a in a previous study (38.Zeng C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10509-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). From this construct, the gene was cloned into pET-24b, which contains a His6 tail at the C terminus of the insertion site between the NdeI site and the EcoRI site, to produce pET-24b-HKI. The plasmid was then modified to add four additional histidine residues to increase the expressed affinity of the protein toward nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. This modification was made through mutagenesis using PCR with the forward primer 5′-CAAGCTTGCGGCCGCACTCGAGCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACTGAGATCC-3′ and its reverse compliment. The forward primers for the directed mutations Thr232 → Ala and Thr536 → Ala were 5′-GAAGTCGGCCTGATCATCGGCGCTGGCACCAATGCTTGCTACAT-3′ and 5′-GCCCTGGATCTTGGAGGAGCCAATTTCCGTGTGCTGCTGGTGAAAATCC-3′, respectively (modified nucleotides underlined). A mutant, α+2 HKI, with an extended connecting helix between the N- and C-halves of the enzyme, was made through two rounds of PCR mutagenesis, adding seven amino acids, or approximately two turns of α-helix, after position 466 of HKI. The first round added four amino acid residues, using the forward primer 5′-GCCTACCGCTTGGCCGAGCAGCACATGAACCTGCACCGGCAGATAGAGGAGACCCTG-3′. The second primer inserted the remaining nine nucleotides with forward primer 5′-TGGCCGAGCAGCACATGAACCTGGCGGAACAGCACCGGCAGATAGAGGAGACCCTG-3′ (the inserted codons are underlined). The Thr232 → Ala/α+2 combination mutant employed the above Thr232 → Ala primers on the α+2 construct. The entire gene of each mutant as well as that of the wild-type enzyme was verified by sequencing.Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Hexokinases—Wild-type or mutant pET-24b-HKI plasmids were transformed into Rosetta (DE3) cells, which were then grown in LB media at 37 °C to an OD of 1.0. The temperature was then lowered to 16 °C and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Cells were harvested 16-20 h after induction and resuspended in a lysis buffer of 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm glucose, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. In addition to the lysis buffer, 50 μg/ml DNase I, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added to the suspension. The cells were then lysed using a French press and centrifuged. The supernatant fluid was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. The column was washed with 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm glucose, 40 mm imidazole, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and then eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was then dialyzed overnight in 25 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.5, 2 mm glucose, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was then applied to a preparative DEAE HPLC column as described previously (35.Fang T.Y. Alechina O. Alechin A.E. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19548-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Iowa State University Protein Facility performed N-terminal sequencing on purified HKI. Prior to N-terminal sequencing, the protein was bound to a ProSorb sample preparation cartridge (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) containing a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The N terminus was deblocked by soaking the HKI-coated membrane in 0.6 m HCl overnight (39.Tsunasawa S. Hirano H. Imahori K. Sakiyama F. Methods in Protein Sequence Analysis. Plenum Publishing, New York1993: 43-51Google Scholar).Pig Liver Mitochondria Purification—Pig livers were obtained from the Iowa State University Meats Laboratory shortly after slaughter. Mitochondria were purified by the procedure of Graham (40.Graham J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 19: 29-40PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were resuspended in the storage buffer with two modifications: no potassium phosphate was added, and the solution contained 5% Me2SO, which acts as a cryoprotectant (41.Dickenson D.B. Misch M.J. Drury R.E. Science. 1967; 156: 1738-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mitochondria were then flash frozen in dry ice-ethanol and stored at -80 °C.The HKI Activity Assay—Hexokinase activity was measured using the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled spectrophotometric assay at pH 8.0 (20.Fromm H.J. Zewe V. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1661-1667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hexokinase concentrations were determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard (42.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar). Initial rate data were analyzed using the computer program GraFit (43.Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 5. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK2001Google Scholar). For kinetic measurements of HKI on the mitochondrial membrane, whole mitochondria with bound hexokinase were added to the assay mixture and velocities were measured using the spectrophotometer. These data were fit by nonlinear least squares (using GraFit) to models described under “Results.”Circular Dichroism Spectra—Circular dichroism spectra were measured using a Jasco J710 circular dichroism spectrometer. The data were collected at room temperature between 200 and 260 nm. The concentration of HKI used in these measurements was 0.2 mg/ml in 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, with 0.2 mm glucose and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol.Mitochondrial Binding and Release—Prior to carrying out the binding experiments, HPLC-purified HKI was passed over a Sephadex G-50 column (Sigma) for desalting and to equilibrate the enzyme solution with the mitochondrial binding buffer, and then diluted to 2 mg/ml. The mitochondrial binding buffer contains 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Mitochondria were diluted into this buffer to a concentration of 3 mg/ml, wet weight. Purified HKI and mitochondria were mixed and allowed to stand for 90 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 8 min. Unbound HKI in the supernatant fluid was decanted. Pelleted mitochondria were resuspended in mitochondrial binding buffer, less the MgCl2, and re-centrifuged. This wash step was repeated, after which pelleted mitochondria were resuspended in the mitochondrial binding buffer (MgCl2 absent) and assayed for HKI activity (MgCl2 included with ATP).HKI release from the mitochondria was performed as follows. HKI was bound to mitochondria as above, and then resuspended in a release buffer containing 250 mm sucrose and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. 100-μl aliquots of this solution were distributed to plastic microcentrifuge tubes, to which Glu-6-P at various concentrations was added and allowed to sit for 30 min at room temperature. The mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation. HKI solubilized by Glu-6-P was removed by decanting the supernatant liquid. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and centrifuged again. After discarding the supernatant fluid, pelleted mitochondria were resuspended, and then assayed for hexokinase activity. For the mitochondrial release experiments, data for mutant HKI and wild-type HKI data were collected in parallel.RESULTSHKI Construction, Purification, and N-terminal Sequencing—Purified recombinant HKI used in crystallographic studies was a mixture of proteins beginning with either residue 10 or 12 of the translated DNA sequence (12.Aleshin A. Zeng C. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Structure. 1998; 6: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As the initial 10-12 residues are absolutely crucial for mitochondrial binding (44.Polakis P.G. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the purified recombinant system used in crystallography can provide no information regarding mitochondrial association and release phenomena. With the intent of recovering full-length HKI, a His-tagged HKI-pET-24b construct was prepared to facilitate rapid purification of recombinant enzyme. An initial construct with His6 at the C terminus of HKI bound poorly to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, but a 10-histidyl tag resulted in a construct with strong binding properties. After nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and DEAE chromatography, protein purity was at least 95% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein returned no signal above background, indicating an N terminus chemically blocked from participation in the Edman degradation reaction. Deblocking of the N-formyl group in 0.6 m HCl was successful as evidenced by a clean amino acid sequence (MIAAQ) from five cycles of Edman degradation.Rationale for the Selection of Mutants—As shown previously by Liu et al. (36.Liu X. Kim C.S. Kurbanov F.T. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31155-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the mutation Thr536 → Ala eliminates AnGlu-6-P inhibition of C-terminal half of HKI (TABLE ONE). The mutation of Thr232 → Ala eliminates Pi relief of AnGlu-6-P inhibition in the full-length HKI (35.Fang T.Y. Alechina O. Alechin A.E. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19548-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Either mutation alone has no effect on AnGlu-6-P inhibition of full-length HKI, but when combined, the resulting mutant enzyme is not sensitive to AnGlu-6-P (36.Liu X. Kim C.S. Kurbanov F.T. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31155-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hence, AnGlu-6-P can bind to the N-terminal and/or C-terminal halves of HKI, in each case causing potent inhibition of catalysis by kinetic mechanisms that are competitive with ATP and noncompetitive with glucose (36.Liu X. Kim C.S. Kurbanov F.T. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31155-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

Hence, the two Glu-6-P binding sites in the separate halves of HKI are coupled, allowing Glu-6-P to bind at only one of its two potential binding sites. The mutation at position 536 blocks Glu-6-P binding to the C-terminal half, whereas the mutation at position 232 blocks Glu-6-P binding to the N-terminal half.TABLE ONEKinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant HKI constructsEnzymekcatKmATPKmGlcKiAnGlu-6-Ps–1mmμmWild-type75 ± 41.5 ± 0.262 ± 317 ± 2Wild-type, His-tagged93 ± 31.3 ± 0.476 ± 538 ± 4Thr232 → AlaaFrom Ref. 1,bWithout His tag70 ± 20.81 ± 0.0442 ± 284 ± 5Thr536 → AlabWithout His tag,cFrom Ref. 369.7 ± 0.11.80 ± 0.0643 ± 125 ± 2Thr232 → Ala/Thr536 → AlabWithout His tag,cFrom Ref. 3617.3 ± 0.70.90 ± 0.0361 ± 5NDdNo inhibition by AnGlu-6-P at a concentration of at least 500 μmTruncated C-terminal halfbWithout His tag,cFrom Ref. 3645.6 ± 0.90.5 ± 0.152 ± 425 ± 2Truncated C-terminal half/Thr536 → AlabWithout His tag,cFrom Ref. 3611 ± 10.37 ± 0.0357 ± 3NDα+2bWithout His tag47 ± 11.9 ± 0.148 ± 328 ± 1α+2/Thr232 → AlabWithout His tag56 ± 11.77 ± 0.09180 ± 1021.7 ± 0.9α+2/Thr536 → AlabWithout His tag1.11 ± 0.021.13 ± 0.05180 ± 30NDa From Ref. 1.Wilson J.E.

The insertion is at the middle of the transition helix between the N- and C-terminal halves of HKI, and should add approximately two full turns to that α-helix. The insertion should separate the two halves of the α+2 enzyme by an additional 11 Å while maintaining the relative orientation of the two halves observed in wild-type HKI. The mutation disrupts the coupling between Glu-6-P binding sites of the N- and C-terminal halves, i.e. inhibition of the α+2 construct by AnGlu-6-P is competitive with ATP and noncompetitive with glucose, and as potent as AnGlu-6-P inhibition of the wild-type enzyme (TABLE ONE). Unlike the wild-type enzyme, however, the mutation of Thr536 to alanine in the α+2 construct abolishes AnGlu-6-P inhibition. Hence, the coupling mechanism between the N- and C-terminal halves observed in wild-type HKI no longer operates in the α+2 construct. Glu-6-P, by binding to the C-terminal half of HKI, could conceivably influence the conformation of the N-terminal half of the wild-type system by way of the N-half/C-half coupling mechanism, but that influence would be reduced severely or eliminated altogether in the α+2 construct.Kinetic Analysis of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes—Kinetic parameters of the His-tagge"
https://openalex.org/W2044526479,"The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase in Giardia intestinalis (GiUAP) is one of the five inducible enzymes to synthesize UDP-GalNAc, which is an important precursor for cyst wall synthesis. The recombinant UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (rGiUAP) and its mutants G108A and G210A were expressed and identified by SDS-PAGE, size-exclusion chromatography, Western hybridization, and MALDI mass spectrometry. Sequence comparison with other eukaryotic UAPs has identified three specific motifs. Within these motifs alanine substitution for Gly108 or Gly210 dramatically reduced the pyrophosphate synthesis, suggesting these amino acids are catalytic residues. Besides, the rGiUAP was found to have relaxed binding to other uridine-based nucleotides, suggesting the substrate binding pocket is specific to uridine rather than phosphate group(s). Moreover, thermal denaturation analysis showed a significant increase in Tm for the rGiUAP and G108A upon binding of the substrate Mg-UTP. In contrast, G210A showed a decreased Tm upon binding of Mg-UTP. These results showed that binding of Mg-UTP increases protein stability of the rGiUAP, and the catalytic residue Gly210 plays a significant role in stabilizing the protein structure. Such stabilization effect induced by substrate binding might be physiologically important as it favors the production of UDP-GlcNAc and hence the downstream GalNAc, which is crucial to survival of Giardia. These results help to define the essential amino acids for catalysis in the GiUAP and reveal the role of Mg-UTP binding in regulation of protein stability.

These results help to define the essential amino acids for catalysis in the GiUAP and reveal the role of Mg-UTP binding in regulation of protein stability. Giardia intestinalis has long been recognized as one of the most early branching eukaryotes (1Sogin M.L. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.J. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). It is also one of the most common causes of gastrointestinal infection in human and other mammals (2Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). When this parasite travels down the intestine in the host, the transformation from a vegetative trophozoite to an infectious cyst requires the synthesis of a rigid cyst wall to survive the adverse environmental conditions outside the host. As this transformation represents a basic adaptive response of a eukaryote to the environment for propagation, G. intestinalis provides a simple eukaryotic model for differentiation and, the biochemical mechanisms of encystation and the cyst wall synthesis have been the subject of intensive investigations in the past decade. Previous studies have shown that cyst wall contains both carbohydrate and protein components (3Jarroll E.L. Manning P. Lindmark D.G. Coggins J.R. Erlandsen S.L. Mol. Biochem.

One of the major components of the outer cyst wall has been identified as a [d-GalNAc(β1→3)-d-GalNAc]n homopolymer by chemical methods, mass spectrometry, and hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (10Gerwig G.J. van Kuik J.A. Leeflang B.R. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Karr C.D. Jarroll E.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This GalNAc in G. intestinalis is synthesized from endogenous Glc rather than salvaged from external source (5Macechko P.T. Steimle P.A. Lindmark D.G. Erlandsen S.L. Jarroll E.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The precursor of GalNAc, UDP-GalNAc, is synthesized by five inducible enzymes: glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase (EC 3.5.99.6); glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetylase (EC 2.3.1.4); phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (EC 5.4.2.3, AGM) 2The abbreviations used are:AGMphosphoacetylglucosamine mutaseUAPUDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.23)PphosphateGlcglucoseGlcN-6-Pglucosamine 6-phosphateMg-nucleotide[Mg2+]nucleotideCDcircular dichroism 2The abbreviations used are:AGMphosphoacetylglucosamine mutaseUAPUDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.23)PphosphateGlcglucoseGlcN-6-Pglucosamine 6-phosphateMg-nucleotide[Mg2+]nucleotideCDcircular dichroism; UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.23, UAP); and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.7). UAP is the fourth enzyme catalyzing the reaction: UTP plus GlcNAc-1-P → UDP-GlcNAc plus PPi. The activities of these enzymes have been shown to increase from 8- to 4000-fold during encystation of this parasite (5Macechko P.T. Steimle P.A. Lindmark D.G. Erlandsen S.L. Jarroll E.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To date UAP has been purified and characterized from bacteria (11Strominger J.L. Smith M.S. J. Biol.

However, only the UAP from G. intestinalis has been reported to be developmentally controlled, with 20-fold increase in activity during encystment (5Macechko P.T. Steimle P.A. Lindmark D.G. Erlandsen S.L. Jarroll E.L. Mol. Biochem.

Tay E. Sekyere E. Glenn W.K. Bagnara A.S. Edwards M.R. Gene. 2005; 357: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Analysis of the GiUAP amino acid sequence showed <30% of sequence identity to the other eukaryotic UAP sequences (17Mok M.T. Tay E. Sekyere E. Glenn W.K. Bagnara A.S. Edwards M.R. Gene. 2005; 357: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It has been identified that GiUAP have two developmentally regulated transcripts of ∼1.8 and ∼4.3 kb, which contain the same coding sequence but different unusually long 3′-untranslated regions, and these two transcripts were detectable in both vegetative and encysting trophozoites (17Mok M.T. Tay E. Sekyere E. Glenn W.K. Bagnara A.S. Edwards M.R. Gene. 2005; 357: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These results were significantly different from the smaller transcripts of ∼1.2, ∼1.4, and ∼1.6 kb reported for the GiUAP isolated from MR4 strain (18Lopez A.B. Sener K. Jarroll E.L. van Keulen H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), implying the GiUAP is under different transcription control in different strains of G. intestinalis. In the previous studies the native GiUAP purified from MR4 strain has been characterized kinetically (19Bulik D.A. Lindmark D.G. Jarroll E.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and reported to be allosterically activated by physiological levels of glucosamine 6-phosphate (20Bulik D.A. van Ophem P. Manning J.M. Shen Z. Newburg D.S. Jarroll E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14722-14728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the native GiUAP has never been verified except the enzyme was shown to process pyrophosphorylase activity. This concern is intensified as the latest molecular studies suggest that the purified native GiUAP does not correspond to the protein encoded by the GiUAP gene (17Mok M.T. Tay E. Sekyere E. Glenn W.K. Bagnara A.S. Edwards M.R. Gene. 2005; 357: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Lopez A.B. Sener K. Jarroll E.L. van Keulen H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the reported kinetic data of the GiUAP becomes questionable, there is a lack of structural insight about this enzyme and no catalytic or binding residue(s) have ever been identified. To further our understandings of this enzyme, the recombinant GiUAP (rGiUAP) and its mutants have been expressed and characterized in this study, with extensive kinetic and physical analysis performed to search for the essential catalytic residues and help to define the role of GiUAP in the inducible biosynthesis pathway of GalNAc. Parasite Culture—G. intestinalis trophozoites, Portland 1 strain ATCC30888, were cultured in TYI-S-33 medium as described previously (21Lloyd D. Harris J.C. Maroulis S. Wadley R. Ralphs J.R. Hann A.C. Turner M.P. Edwards M.R. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1349-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Amino Acid Sequence Analysis and Protein Structure Analysis—Protein similarity alignments were performed using the ClustalW, WWW Service at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Protein sequence motif search and identification were performed using EMOTIF (22Nevill-Manning C.G. Wu T.D. Brutlag D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5865-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 23Huang J.Y. Brutlag D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 202-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional protein structure was generated and manipulated using PyMol (pymol.sourceforge.net). Total RNA Extraction—Total RNA was prepared as described before (24Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar) from trophozoites. Reverse Transcription—The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 2 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligo(dT)-anchored primer dT-A 5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT AC(T)17-3′ (antisense) was used to prime the poly(A+) tail of the messenger RNA for the first strand synthesis. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The coding sequences of the two mutants G108A and G210A harboring an alanine substitution for Gly108 and Gly210 were generated by overlap extension (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). PCR was performed using TripleMaster PCR system (Eppendorf) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The two fragments with overlapping ends for each mutant were amplified from cDNA, using primers EP5 5′-cgg tta aag gat cca cgC CAG GCC TGG AGG AGT TTC-3′ (sense), 108R 5′-GTG CTG ATG GGA AGA TAC TAC-3′ (antisense), 108F 5′-GTG CTG ATG GGA AGA TAC TAC-3′ (sense) and EP3 5′-aca tat ggg tac cGT GCT CTA GAC GGC CTT CA-3′ (antisense) for G108A; EP5 (sense), 210R 5′-GTA CGC CAA CAT AAT GAA CCA TGT G-3′ (antisense), 210F 5′-GTA CGC CAA CAT AAT GAA CCA TGT G-3′ (sense) and EP3 (antisense) for G210A. The resulting PCR products were polished by Klenow (Promega) and gel-purified. The final fusion products were amplified using EP5 (sense) and EP3 (antisense) and cloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) to produce pT108 and pT210 for sequencing. Cloning and Expression of the Recombinant Protein—The coding sequences of GiUAP, G108A, and G210A with restriction sites BamHI and KpnI attached were amplified by PCR using primers EP5 (sense) and EP3 (antisense) from the cDNA, pT108, and pT210, respectively, using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen) to generate expression constructs pQUAP, pQ108, and pQ210, which were transformed into Escherichia coli M15 cells (Qiagen). Preparation of cell cultures was modified as described previously (26Minotto L. Tutticci E.A. Bagnara A.S. Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Purification and Quantitation of the Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant proteins with an N-terminal His6 tag were purified using a His-trap® chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). The purification was performed following the manufacturer's instructions, except that 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl was used for column equilibration. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with 20 column volume of 40 mm imidazole in Hepes buffer, prior to elution of the recombinant proteins using 10 column volume of 100 mm imidazole in Hepes buffer. The purified recombinant proteins were immediately desalted using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated by Centriprep YM-10 (Millipore) according to manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant proteins were quantified using the Bradford assay (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) and spectrophotometry at 280 nm (28Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Hybridization—The protein fractions collected along the purification procedures were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were visualized using Coomassie staining (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The presence of the His6 tag of the recombinant proteins was verified by Western hybridization using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid conjugates (Qiagen). The procedures were performed as described by the manufacturer except that a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Novex) was used instead of nitrocellulose membrane; 3% bovine serum albumin was replaced by 5% skim milk powder and an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for signal determination. MALDI Mass Spectrometry Analysis and Size-exclusion Chromatography—MALDI mass spectrometry was performed after tryptic digestion of the purified recombinant protein using sequencinggrade trypsin (Roche Applied Science) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (trypsin:protein mass ratio, 1:100). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 h, with subsequent desalting by ZipTip (Millipore). The resulting peptide fragments were analyzed on a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). The masses of the peptide fragments were analyzed using MOWSE peptide mass fingerprint search (30Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6661) Google Scholar). Size-exclusion chromatography was performed by applying proteins to a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl or phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm NaN3. The protein size standards used were IgG (bovine γ globulin, 158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12, 1350 Da). The column was calibrated with the protein size standards each time before a protein sample was applied. The corresponding absorbance was measured by the AKTA purifier fast-protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Enzyme Assay—The high flux assay has been modified and described in a previous report (31Mok M.T. Edwards M.R. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 343: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the forward direction to quantify the pyrophosphate, the incubation mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, GlcNAc-1-P, and UTP at 2 to 10 times greater than its Km values, 0.04 unit of pyrophosphatase, and various amounts of recombinant protein in a final volume of 100 μl. Mg2+ was used in excess in the assay to ensure all UTP was saturated to form the Mg-UTP complex. The assay was performed in a 96-well plate at 37 °C for 10 min, stopped by adding 100 μl of color reagent (0.03% (w/v) malachite green, 0.2% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 0.7 n HCl) followed by a 5-min incubation at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at 655 nm. Each enzyme assay was performed at least twice in at least two different experiments. The standard curve was constructed by including different concentrations of inorganic phosphate in the incubation mixture, except that GlcNAc-1-P, pyrophosphatase, and recombinant proteins were omitted. Other necessary controls were included as described (31Mok M.T. Edwards M.R. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 343: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Intrinsic Fluorescence Quenching Analysis—Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50-B luminescence spectrometer with the use of a 1-cm × 1-cm quartz cell. Titrations with ligands were performed at room temperature by sequentially adding aliquots (up to 100 μl) of the concentrated quencher stock solution to 2 ml of 2 μm recombinant protein in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaN3. The excitation wavelength was set at 300 nm, and the fluorescence emission spectra were scanned between 350 and 500 nm. All spectra were corrected for background fluorescence. The diminution effect and the inner filter effect of recombinant protein solution due to addition of ligand were corrected by using Equation 1 (32Stoitsova S.R. Boteva R.N. Doyle R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Fcor=(Fexp−B)×(Vo+ViVo)×10Λ(Aex+Aem2)(Eq. 1) where Fcor is corrected and Fexp the experimentally measured values of the fluorescence intensities, B is the background fluorescence of the buffer, Vo is the initial sample volume, Vi is the total volume of ligands added, and Aex and Aem are the additional absorbance values of the sample at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively, owing to the added ligand. The equilibrium constants, Kd, for the association of recombinant protein with various ligands were analyzed as described (33Wieczorek Z. Darzynkiewicz E. Lonnberg H. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1998; 43: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), by Equation 2, [L]totΔF=KdΔFmax−ΔF+[P]totΔFmax(Eq. 2) where [L]tot and [P]tot are the total concentration of the ligand and recombinant protein, respectively. The ΔF is defined by, ΔF=Fcor−F(Eq. 3) where Fcor and F refer to the corrected fluorescence intensities of the recombinant protein in the absence of the ligand and at a given total concentration of the ligand. The ΔFmax is estimated using the Equation 4 (34Chakrabarti A. Bhattacharya S. Ray S. Bhattacharyya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1189-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), 1ΔF=1ΔFmax+1([L]−[P]int)×K′×ΔFmax(Eq. 4) where ΔF is described as above, [L] is the concentration of ligand, [P]int is the initial concentration of the recombinant protein, and K′ is the apparent binding constant. The linear double reciprocal plot of 1/ΔF against 1/([L]-[P]int) is extrapolated to the ordinate to obtain the value of ΔFmax from the intercept. The equilibrium constant, Kd, of association is defined by Equation 5, Kd=[LP][L]×[P](Eq. 5) where [L], [P], and [LP] stand for the concentration of the free ligand, free recombinant protein, and the associate of the ligand and recombinant protein, respectively. The stoichiometry of binding was established from a linear version of the Hill equation (35Painter G.R. Wright L.L. Hopkins S. Furman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19362-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), log(ΔFΔFmax−ΔF)=n×log[L]−logK(Eq. 6) where ΔF, ΔFmax, and [L] are described as above, n is the hill coefficient representing the order of binding reaction with respect to ligand concentration, and K is the concentration of ligand that yields 50% of ΔFmax. Circular Dichroism Analysis—CD measurements of recombinant proteins were made using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. The recombinant proteins were freshly desalted into 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and filtered through a 0.22-μm sterile filter before the measurement. For the ligand binding studies, the desalted recombinant proteins were either preincubated with GlcNAc-1-P or Mg-UTP up to 1 mm. For the far-UV CD measurement, 0.4 ml of 0.1 mg/ml recombinant protein and a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell were used for scans between 190 and 260 nm at 20 °C; for the near-UV CD measurement, 3 ml of 1 mg/ml recombinant protein and a 1-cm path length quartz cell were used for scans between 240 and 350 nm at 20 °C; for the temperature melt CD measurement, the conditions were similar to far-UV CD measurement except that temperature was varied manually from 20 to 90 °C. The CD of the samples was monitored in two ways: the spectrum scan between 190 and 260 nm and the time course measurement at 208 nm for a time interval of 2 min. All spectra were corrected for background CD. Mean residue ellipticity [Φ]mrw,λ at a given wavelength λ in units of deg.cm2.dmol-1 was obtained by Equation 7, [Φ]mrw,λ=Φ×MRW10×d×c(Eq. 7) where MRW is obtained by dividing the molecular weight by N-1(N is the number of amino acids of the protein sample), Φ is the observed ellipticity (mdeg), d is the path length (cm), and c is the protein concentration (mg/ml) (36Kelly S.M.

Identification of UAP Motifs—An amino acid sequence motif of L(X)2GXGTXM(X)4PK, where X represents any amino acid was proposed for UAP by comparing the amino acid sequence of the bifunctional N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase from E. coli and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human, respectively (12Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although this motif has been successfully applied to search and identify the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP) from the yeast data base (12Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), it cannot be the representative of UAP family. Moreover, the amino acid sequences of prokaryotic UAPs were found to differ significantly from those of eukaryotic UAPs (data not shown). By comparing the identified eukaryotic UAP sequences to date, including GiUAP using the multiple sequences alignment, three highly conserved regions were identified (Fig. 1). These highly conserved amino acid fragments were analyzed by EMOTIF, and this resulted in the identification of three putative motifs from the amino acid sequence of GiUAP: 107GGQXTRLG(X)3PKG120, 208P(D/N)GN(G/A)G(X)3A217 and 382KXEXFXFDXF391. These motifs were found to surround the substrate binding site in the human UAPs: AGX1 and AGX2 (37Peneff C. Ferrari P. Charrier V. Taburet Y. Monnier C. Zamboni V. Winter J. Harnois M. Fassy F.

Searches in the Swiss-Prot data base using any of these three putative motifs resulted in exclusive identification of eukaryotic UAPs, indicating that the identified putative motifs are highly specific for UAP conserved sequences.FIGURE 1Sequence alignment of eukaryotic UAP.

The denatured molecular masses of rGiUAP, G108A, and G210A were estimated to be ∼50 kDa from SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3A), which were consistent with the predicted 49,624 Da for rGiUAP and 49,638 Da for the mutants from the gene sequences. The presence of a His6 tag in rGiUAP, G108A, and G210A was verified by Western hybridization (Fig. 3B). The identity of the expressed rGiUAP, G108A, and G210A was confirmed by peptide mass fingerprinting. The observed masses of the digested peptide fragments were measured by MALDI mass spectrometry and subsequently compared with the predicted masses of the digested peptide fragments obtained from the NCBI protein data base. The rGiUAP was shown as the only significant match with 20 peptide fragments identified and 64% of the amino acid sequence covered (data not shown). The G108A and G210A were also distinguished from the wild type rGiUAP by identifying the mass of the specific peptide containing the mutated amino acid (data not shown). All the recombinant proteins were eluted as single peaks in size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown), and their molecular masses estimated from the standard curve were ∼47 kDa, which is in good agreement with the 49 kDa predicted from the amino acid sequence. Enzyme Activity of the Recombinant Enzymes—For the rGiUAP, the crude, soluble and His-trap®-purified fractions were measured to monitor the enzyme activities during purification, as well as the desalted fraction (TABLE ONE). The final desalted fraction was used for the relative kinetics for different substrates (TABLE TWO). The related data reported for the native GiUAP (19Bulik D.A. Lindmark D.G. Jarroll E.L. Mol.

Whereas ALX is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm, ALX partially resides in the nucleus, and the nuclear pool is rapidly depleted in response to T cell receptor (TCR)/CD28 signaling. Here it is shown that this depletion occurs via nuclear export of ALX, which depends on a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in its carboxyl segment and on the CRM-1 transport protein. Nuclear import of ALX also depends on its carboxyl-terminal segment. Blocking nuclear export of ALX, either pharmacologically, by leptomycin B, or by site-directed mutation of the ALX NES, impairs CD28-mediated phosphorylation of ALX. Additionally, upon overexpression, the ALX NES mutant was found to be impaired in inhibiting TCR/CD28-induced transcriptional up-regulation of the RE/AP composite element from the IL-2 promoter, whereas a truncated form of ALX that is a potent inhibitor of RE/AP activation was found to reside entirely in the cytoplasm. Together, these results show that ALX exerts its effect on IL-2 up-regulation in the cytoplasm and suggest an intricate relationship between the nuclear localization/export, phosphorylation, and activity of ALX in response to TCR and CD28 signaling.

T cell activation, a critical step in the immune response, is triggered by two signals: activation of the T cell receptor (TCR) 2The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; IL-2, interleukin 2; TSAd, T cell-specific adaptor; SH2, Src homology 2; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; LMB, leptomycin B; NES, nuclear export signal. by a specific antigen and a costimulatory signal, generally provided by the cell surface receptor CD28 (reviewed in Ref. 1.Chambers C.A. Allison J.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a key event in T cell activation that results, at least partly, from the convergence of TCR and CD28 signaling pathways, leading to an increase in transcription of the IL-2 promoter through the RE/AP composite element (2.Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We recently identified an adaptor protein designated ALX (for adaptor from lymphocytes of unknown function (“X”), which has a hematopoietic specific expression pattern and may play a role in CD28 mediated up-regulation of the IL-2 promoter (3.Greene T.A. Powell P. Nzerem C. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45128-45134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression in Jurkat T cells, ALX inhibited up-regulation of an RE/AP luciferase reporter in response to TCR and CD28 activation, whereas activation of an AP-1 reporter, responsive to TCR signaling alone, was unaffected. Hence, ALX is believed to act predominantly in the signaling pathway triggered by CD28, which leads to RE/AP transcriptional up-regulation. ALX was also shown to be a downstream target of TCR/CD28 signaling, undergoing phosphorylation in response to TCR activation as well as CD28 costimulation (3.Greene T.A. Powell P. Nzerem C. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45128-45134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ALX is closely related to another hematopoietic adaptor protein, T cell-specific adaptor (TSAd), the murine homolog of which is known as RLK/ITK-binding protein (4.Rajogopal K. Sommers C.L. Decker D.C. Mitchell E.O. Kortbauer U. Sperling A.I. Kozak C.A. Love P.E. Bluestone J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5.Spurkland A. Brinchmann J.E.

Similar to ALX, overexpression of TSAd affects up-regulation of the IL-2 promoter in Jurkat T cells (6.Choi Y.B. Kim C.K. Yun Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5242-5249PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Sundvold V.

T cells from mice with a targeted deletion of TSAd display a defect in IL-2 production (4.Rajogopal K. Sommers C.L. Decker D.C. Mitchell E.O. Kortbauer U. Sperling A.I. Kozak C.A. Love P.E. Bluestone J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and these mice develop autoimmune disease as they age, including the development of antinuclear antibodies (8.Drappa J. Kamen L.A. Chan E. Georgiev M. Ashany D. Marti F. King P.D. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 809-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ALX contains a single Src homology 2 (SH2) domain followed by a longer carboxyl-terminal segment. The SH2 domain of ALX has been shown previously to be required for the inhibition of RE/AP and recognition of a tyrosine-phosphorylated binding partner (9.Shapiro M.J. Powell P. Ndubuizu A. Nzerem C. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40647-40652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here, it is shown that the carboxyl-terminal segment of ALX is critical for the trafficking of ALX between the cytoplasm and nucleus, containing both sequences required for import into the nucleus and for TCR signal dependent nuclear export. It is also shown that nuclear export is a CRM-1-dependent process. Further, we are able to conclude that the inhibition of RE/AP by ALX involves an effect exerted in the cytoplasm and that this inhibition is enhanced by the exit of ALX from the nucleus. Plasmids and Antibodies Used—Myc epitope-tagged ALX and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-ALX fusion proteins (wild type and truncations) were described previously (3.Greene T.A. Powell P. Nzerem C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40647-40652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The nuclear export signal in ALX was mutated by substituting alanines for the leucines at positions 203, 207, and 210 (numbers refer to human ALX amino acid sequence) by PCR mutagenesis, and the mutant was subcloned into the same vectors as wild type ALX for expression of Myc and YFP-tagged versions. The RE/AP luciferase reporter was described previously (2.Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to the Myc epitope (clone 9B11; Cell Signaling), YFP (clone 11E5; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), Nck (clone 108; BD Biosciences), MEF2D (clone 9; BD Biosciences), and CD28 (clone 15E8; Caltag) were purchased from the indicated suppliers. C305 is a monoclonal antibody specific to the clonotypic TCR of Jurkat T cells and was generously provided by Art Weiss (University of California, San Francisco, CA) (10.Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Jurkat transfections, stimulations, and luciferase assays were performed as previously described (2.Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11.Shapiro V.S. Mollenauer M.N. Greene W.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 × 106 Jurkat T cells were washed once and resuspended in 0.4 ml of serum-free RPMI. 20 μg of reporter with 1 μg of YFP expression plasmid (as described in the legend to Fig. 5) were added. Electroporation was performed using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 250 V, 950 microfarads. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI with 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The following day, live cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion (Bio-Whittaker), and 1 × 105 cells/sample were stimulated as denoted in the figures. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with antibodies to TCR (C305; 1:1000 final dilution) and antibodies to CD28 (1 μg/ml) for 7 h. Alternatively, they were incubated with 1 μg/ml staphylococcal enterotoxin D and 1 × 105 Raji B cells for 16 h. Luciferase assays were performed as previously described (11.Shapiro V.S. Mollenauer M.N. Greene W.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected using Fugene6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 1 μg of DNA and 3 μl of Fugene6 were diluted in 100 μl of serum-free medium. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, this mixture was added to one well in a 6-well dish containing a monolayer of cells in 1 ml of complete medium. The cells were incubated overnight, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and then harvested and subject to fractionation. Stimulations and Subcellular Fractionation—Jurkat cell lines stably expressing wild type and mutant ALX proteins were generated as described previously (3.Greene T.A. Powell P. Nzerem C. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45128-45134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For stimulations, Jurkat cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 10 million/ml. If indicated, leptomycin B (Calbiochem) was added at a concentration of 25 ng/ml, and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. At various times, antibodies to TCR and CD28 were added (see Ref. 9.Shapiro M.J. Powell P. Ndubuizu A. Nzerem C. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40647-40652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the cells were returned to 37 °C. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation was performed according to a published protocol (9.Shapiro M.J. Powell P. Ndubuizu A. Nzerem C. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40647-40652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schattner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in a hypotonic buffer and incubated on ice. Nonidet P-40 was then added, and the lysates were vortexed briefly and then subject to centrifugation, resulting in pelleting of the nuclei. Supernatants were then removed as the cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclear pellets were washed, lysed in hypertonic buffer, and subject to centrifugation. Supernatants were then removed as the nuclear fraction. Both fractions were combined with reducing sample buffer and boiled before loading on gels and analyzed by Western blotting. In previous work on the regulation of the IL-2 promoter in Jurkat T cells by the adaptor protein ALX, it was noted that a fraction of ALX is located in the nucleus and that this nuclear pool is rapidly depleted in response to TCR and CD28 signaling (9.Shapiro M.J. Powell P. Ndubuizu A. Nzerem C. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40647-40652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To further investigate the function of ALX, experiments were performed to characterize the mechanism responsible for the disappearance of ALX from the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 1, ALX was found in both cytoplasmic and nuclear pools as determined by anti-Myc immunoblotting of subcellular fractions of a Jurkat T cell line expressing Myc-tagged wild-type ALX. To allow for comparison of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein in the same exposure, 4 times more cell equivalents of nuclear extracts were loaded per lane relative to cytoplasmic extracts. Since similar levels of ALX protein were apparent when nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from unstimulated cells were analyzed, we can conclude that roughly 20% of ALX resides in the nucleus (Fig. 1; see Ref. 9.Shapiro M.J. Powell P. Ndubuizu A. Nzerem C. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40647-40652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A similar subcellular distribution was also observed in 293T cells (see below). Upon stimulation of the cells with antibodies to the TCR and CD28, significant depletion of ALX from the nuclear pool was observed within 5 min, and nearly all of the ALX protein was depleted by 15 min. Stimulation with antibodies to the TCR alone was sufficient to drive ALX nuclear depletion (data not shown). As a control for effective fractionation, the extracts were also blotted with antibodies to MEF2D and Nck; MEF2D was detected only in nuclear extracts, and Nck was predominantly cytoplasmic. Equivalent amounts of MEF2D and Nck were also observed in samples from each time of stimulation, demonstrating equal protein loading between lanes. The nuclear export of many molecules has been shown to be mediated by the protein CRM-1 (reviewed in Ref. 13.Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), a process that can be inhibited by the fatty acid leptomycin B (LMB). To determine whether the disappearance of ALX from the nucleus is due to CRM-1-mediated nuclear export, cells were treated with LMB for 2 h prior to stimulation with antibodies to the TCR and CD28. As shown in Fig. 1, this treatment did not alter the subcellular distribution of ALX in unstimulated cells. However, LMB treatment nearly eliminated TCR/CD28-mediated nuclear export of ALX. Nuclear export of proteins by CRM-1 has been found to depend on the presence of a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) within these proteins. The consensus NES consists of three leucine residues separated by two or three intervening residues, followed by a fourth leucine one residue carboxyl to the third (LX2,3LX2,3LXL). However, substitutions of different hydrophobic residues for the leucines seem to be tolerated (see NESbase 1.0 (14.la Cour T. Gupta, Rapacki K. Skriver K. Poulson F.M. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar)). NES sequences lacking the fourth leucine have also been reported, for instance in NFAT and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1 proteins (15.Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 16.Vischioni B. Giaccone G. Span S.W. Kruyt F.A.E. Rodriguez J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The sequence LXXXLXXL, similar to the consensus NES, was found in human ALX carboxyl to its SH2 domain (Fig. 2). To determine whether this sequence is conserved in ALX from different species, the sequence of human ALX was aligned with that of the previously identified mouse ALX (3.Greene T.A. Powell P. Nzerem C. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45128-45134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and of ALX orthologues from rat, horse, pig, cow, and dog, which were obtained by a Blast search using human ALX protein sequence against the translated EST data base through NCBI (rat/Rattus norvegicus Unigene Rn.126627, horse/Equus caballus GenBank™ accession CD466966, pig/Sus scrofa Unigene Ssc. 9327, cow/Bos taurus Unigene Bt. 26963, and dog/Canis familiaris GenBank™ accession XM541968). Strikingly, the leucines in the putative NES sequence in human ALX are completely conserved in the all orthologues. Additionally, the spacing as well as the residues separating the leucines are also highly conserved. These results suggest that this conserved area of ALX containing the putative NES serves an important role in ALX function. To determine whether the putative NES described above is required for the nuclear export of ALX, a mutated version of human ALX was generated in which the three critical leucines were replaced with alanines (this mutant is designated “ALX(NES),” and wild type ALX is termed “ALX(wt)”). A Jurkat T cell line in which Myc-tagged ALX(NES) is expressed was generated, and localization of ALX in this cell line was compared with that in a cell line expressing ALX(wt) at a similar level. As shown in Fig. 3, the distribution of ALX(NES) between cytoplasmic and nuclear pools in unstimulated cells was very similar to ALX(wt); however, nuclear export of ALX(NES) upon TCR/CD28 stimulation was abrogated. Similar results were also observed with several other cell lines expressing the same mutant ALX (data not shown). As in Fig. 1, blots were performed with antibodies to Nck and MEF2D to control for nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation as well as for loading. Previous work has shown that ALX in cytoplasmic extracts undergoes rapid phosphorylation in response to TCR and CD28 activation as well as a shift in gel mobility, presumably due to this phosphorylation (9.Shapiro M.J. Powell P. Ndubuizu A. Nzerem C. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40647-40652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The appearance of a higher molecular weight form of ALX after 15 min of stimulation was found to depend upon CD28 (3.Greene T.A. Powell P. Nzerem C. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45128-45134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is interesting that substantially less of this higher molecular weight form was observed in cells treated with LMB or in cells expressing ALX(NES) (see 15 and 45 min lanes of cytoplasmic extracts in Figs. 1 and 3). It is possible that indirect effects cause this deficit; LMB might influence upstream kinases, and the NES mutation might alter the structure of ALX, impairing its phosphorylation. However, given that two independent means of inhibiting nuclear export of ALX also impaired CD28-mediated phosphorylation, it seems more likely that nuclear export and CD28-induced phosphorylation are mechanistically linked. It should be noted that an ALX mutant that is resistant to CD28-mediated phosphorylation displays normal nuclear export (9.Shapiro M.J. Powell P. Ndubuizu A. Nzerem C. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40647-40652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hence, it cannot be concluded that CD28-mediated phosphorylation is necessary for nuclear export of ALX but only that nuclear export is in some way required for ALX to be a target of CD28 signaling. To begin to identify the region of ALX responsible for import into the nucleus, we examined the localization of a set of ALX truncation mutants fused to YFP. As shown in Fig. 4, 293T human embryonic kidney cells were transiently transfected with an expression construct for YFP or for various YFP-ALX fusion proteins. Immunoblotting of subcellular fractions with antibodies to YFP showed that unfused YFP was almost entirely cytoplasmic. A fusion protein containing full-length, wild type ALX (YFP-ALX(wt)) was found in both cytoplasmic and nuclear pools in proportions closely matching those observed in Jurkat cells (about 20% nuclear). A full-length fusion in which the putative NES was mutated (YFP-ALX(NES)) also was distributed in the same proportions in 293T cells as in Jurkat cells. ALX can be divided into three segments: a short amino-terminal segment followed by an SH2 domain and a larger carboxyl-terminal segment after the SH2 domain (9.Shapiro M.J. Powell P. Ndubuizu A. Nzerem C. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40647-40652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A fusion protein in which the amino-terminal segment of ALX was deleted localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, as did full-length ALX, whereas a fusion protein in which the carboxyl-terminal segment was deleted was found to be entirely cytoplasmic. Similarly, a fusion containing only the SH2 domain of ALX was entirely cytoplasmic. This analysis was also performed by transiently transfecting Jurkat cells with the same set of YFP-ALX constructs. Their distributions between the cytoplasm and nucleus, assessed with polyclonal antibodies to ALX, were found to be identical to the distributions observed in 293T cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal segment of ALX, but not the SH2 domain or amino-terminal segment, contains a sequence that can confer nuclear localization to a cytoplasmic protein (YFP) and presumably mediates the nuclear import of ALX. Because analysis of the sequence of ALX did not reveal an obvious nuclear localization signal (reviewed in Ref. 17.Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), it is possible that nuclear import of ALX depends on an interaction of its carboxyl-terminal segment with another protein. To determine how the nuclear export of ALX influences its ability to inhibit RE/AP up-regulation, Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with an RE/AP luciferase reporter (2.Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) along with expression constructs for either YFP, YFP-ALX(wt), or YFP-ALX(NES). Immunoblotting showed that the wild type and NES mutant YFP-ALX proteins were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). Cells were then stimulated using antibodies to TCR/CD28 or staphylococcal enterotoxin D presented by Raji B cells. As shown in Fig. 5 and as previously reported (3.Greene T.A. Powell P. Nzerem C. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45128-45134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), substantial up-regulation of the RE/AP luciferase reporter occurred upon stimulation of the cells that were transfected with YFP vector alone, whereas up-regulation of the RE/AP reporter was significantly inhibited when the cells were transfected with YFP-ALX(wt). However, YFP-ALX(NES) overexpression had a minimal inhibition on RE/AP activation, showing that the mutation impaired the ability of ALX to affect RE/AP. In summary, it has been shown that the nuclear export of ALX, triggered by TCR stimulation, is inhibited by LMB, an inhibitor of CRM-1 activity, and that this export depends on a leucine-rich NES sequence similar to the consensus sequence for CRM-1-mediated export. In addition to containing an NES sequence, the carboxyl-terminal segment of ALX has also been shown to contain a sequence necessary for its nuclear import. The results of Figs. 1 and 3 also yield insight into the mechanism of TCR-mediated nuclear export of ALX. This export can be explained by either a direct or indirect effect of signaling. First, ALX might cycle constitutively between the cytoplasm and nucleus, resulting in a steady state level in each pool. In this case, TCR signaling could indirectly trigger a depletion of the nuclear pool by causing ALX to be trapped in the cytoplasm by, for example, promoting the formation of a complex of ALX with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. This model would imply that blocking nuclear export, even in the absence of TCR stimulation, should result in the rapid accumulation of ALX in the nucleus due to constitutive import. However, neither the NES mutation nor the inhibitor LMB caused a substantial increase in the proportion of ALX in the nucleus in unstimulated cells. Hence, the data support a model in which TCR signaling directly results in the export of ALX from the nucleus. Perhaps the NES sequence in ALX is exposed to the nuclear export machinery after TCR signaling due to changes in the phosphorylation state of nuclear ALX or changes in protein-protein interactions. Another conclusion that can be drawn from the results presented here is that the inhibition of RE/AP by ALX depends on the activity of ALX residing in the cytoplasm. Importantly, an ALX mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal segment, as well as a mutant composed of the SH2 domain in isolation, was found to be entirely cytoplasmic. Both of these mutants were unimpaired in their ability to inhibit activation of RE/AP (9.Shapiro M.J. Powell P. Ndubuizu A. Nzerem C. Shapiro V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40647-40652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that ALX exerts its inhibitory effect in the cytoplasm by binding to a target protein involved in the signaling pathway leading to RE/AP up-regulation and IL-2 promoter activation. These findings might suggest that movement of ALX between the nucleus and cytoplasm directed by its carboxyl-terminal segment is dispensable for its function. However, it is unlikely that overexpression studies fully reveal the function and regulation of ALX. For instance, ALX may have some activity involving interactions with nuclear proteins that is entirely separable from the inhibition of RE/AP but that is influenced by TCR and CD28 signaling. Further, movement of ALX out of the nucleus triggered by TCR signaling may have a crucial influence on the amount of ALX available to act on proteins in the cytoplasm. The ALX(NES) mutant was found to be defective in the inhibition of RE/AP. One explanation for this phenotype is that the defect in TCR-mediated nuclear export reduces the amount of ALX in the cytoplasm available to act on the pathway upstream of RE/AP. In addition, the NES mutant also displayed a defect in CD28-mediated phosphorylation, which might be important for ALX to function downstream of CD28. In any case, it is interesting that impairing nuclear export of ALX affected both CD28-mediated phosphorylation and the function of ALX in inhibiting RE/AP. Hence, the data suggest some intricate connection between the subcellular localization, phosphorylation, and function of ALX downstream of TCR and CD28. Adaptor proteins, which propagate signals from cell surface receptors through protein-protein interactions, are generally thought to act in the cytoplasm. However, there are other proteins that, like ALX, have a signaling function in the cytoplasm but also have a nuclear pool. For example, the Fas-associated death domain and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1 proteins are both recruited by plasma membrane receptors that trigger cell death. However, each also localizes to the nucleus and has a leucine-rich NES necessary for export (16.Vischioni B. Giaccone G. Span S.W. Kruyt F.A.E. Rodriguez J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18.Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mutation of the NES in the Fas-associated death domain impairs its ability to promote cell death (18.Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Further, the neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein regulates actin nucleation at the cell periphery and also localizes to the nucleus (19.Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42515-42523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nuclear export of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein was found to be promoted by a tyrosine kinase. A phosphorylation site mutant of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein was found to accumulate in the nucleus and to block focus formation caused by overexpression of this kinase. The subcellular localization of TSAd, a lymphocyte-specific adaptor closely related to ALX, has been described in a number of reports. In one, TSAd was shown to be localized to the cytoplasm and to accumulate at immune synapses after T cell activation (20.Sun W. Wei X. Kesavan K. Garrington T.P. Fan R. Mei J. Anderson S.M. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2298-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, in another report, TSAd was shown to localize predominantly to the nucleus (21.Marti F. Post N.H. Chan F. King P.D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both the function of TSAd and its nuclear localization have been shown to depend on its SH2 domain (21.Marti F. Post N.H. Chan F. King P.D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is plausible that both ALX and TSAd have functions in the cytoplasm and also localize to the nucleus, which might serve as a means to regulate the concentration of cytoplasmic protein or to allow them to serve a separate function. In any case, it is clear that further investigation of the subcellular localization of these two related proteins and how TCR and CD28 signals influence this localization will be critical to understanding their role in T cell activation.

https://openalex.org/W2054757208,"Expression of α and β chains and their post-translational assembly into α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> tetramers is fundamental to the formation and function of most vertebrate hemoglobins. There is a strong evolutionary bias that favors expression of equal amounts of the two types of chains, because cooperativity, pH sensitivity, and anionic control of function occurs only for the α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> tetramers. Remarkably, an over-production of α chains, as in the pathological condition known as β thalassemia in humans, is adaptive rather than pathological in the bluefish hemoglobin system. The thalassemia of the bluefish is a novel means of providing for oxygen uptake and delivery when low pH conditions incapacitate the highly pH-sensitive Root effect hemoglobins of the fish. Although fish often have pH-insensitive along with highly pH-sensitive hemoglobins, having pH-insensitive α chain monomers in circulation is an unusual structural variation. The role of bluefish α chains in oxygen transport is enabled by their remarkably lower oxygen affinity relative to human α chains. This is the first reported case of a thalassemic condition that is maintained in a species as an adaptive advantage."
