https://openalex.org/W1496390586,"Quantum dots or rings are artificial nanometre-sized clusters that confine electrons in all three directions. They can be fabricated in a semiconductor system by embedding an island of low-bandgap material in a sea of material with a higher bandgap. Quantum dots are often referred to as artificial atoms because, when filled sequentially with electrons, the charging energies are pronounced for particular electron numbers1,2,3; this is analogous to Hund's rules in atomic physics. But semiconductors also have a valence band with strong optical transitions to the conduction band. These transitions are the basis for the application of quantum dots as laser emitters4, storage devices5,6,7 and fluorescence markers8. Here we report how the optical emission (photoluminescence) of a single quantum ring changes as electrons are added one-by-one. We find that the emission energy changes abruptly whenever an electron is added to the artificial atom, and that the sizes of the jumps reveal a shell structure."

We show that self-association of Nod1 mediates proximity of RICK and the interaction of RICK with the γ subunit of the IκB kinase (IKKγ). Similarly, the RICK-related kinase RIP associated via its intermediate region with IKKγ. A mutant form of IKKγ deficient in binding to IKKα and IKKβ inhibited NF-κB activation induced by RICK or RIP. Enforced oligomerization of RICK or RIP as well as of IKKγ, IKKα, or IKKβ was sufficient for induction of NF-κB activation. Thus, the proximity of RICK, RIP, and IKK complexes may play an important role for NF-κB activation during Nod1 oligomerization or trimerization of the tumor necrosis factor α receptor.

Functional analyses with truncation mutants of both Nod1 and RICK have suggested that Nod1 and RICK act in the same pathway of NF-κB activation (1Bertin J. Nir W.J. Fischer C.M. Tayber O.V.

The functional and structural similarities between Apaf-1 and Nod1 suggest that these proteins are members of a protein family that regulates downstream factors by a common molecular mechanism. WDR, the unique domain of Apaf-1, plays an essential role in allowing Apaf-1 to respond to cytochrome c released from mitochondria, a triggering signal for apoptosis (8Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X.

Proteins with LRR-containing domains linked with NBDs are also found in plants and are thought to be involved in a defensive response against specific pathogens such as bacteria and fungi (10Parniske M.

In animal cells, Toll-like receptor family members have extracellular LRRs and upon binding to microbial components activate a signaling pathway that includes NF-κB activation leading to a defensive reaction in the animal (11Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) also plays an important role in the inflammatory response against pathogenic stimuli and induces both apoptosis and NF-κB activation (12Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The mammalian cell has two TNF receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, but TNFR1 plays the major role in TNFα signaling (12Tracey K.J.

Apoptosis induced by TNFα is dependent on caspase-8, whereas RIP, a RICK-like adaptor molecule, plays a central role in TNFα-dependent NF-κB activation (15Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V.

Binding of trimeric TNFα to TNFR1 induces recruitment of procaspase-8 and RIP to the TNFR1 complex through FADD and TRADD, respectively (15Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar,18Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5025) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that zymogen forms of apical caspases, such as caspase-8 and caspase-9, are activated by oligomerization of their upstream factors, the TNFR1 complex and Apaf-1, respectively (for review, Ref. 19Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of these caspase activators is thought to bring their interacting procaspase molecules in close proximity, allowing these immature proteases to self-activate through their intrinsic low enzymatic activity (19Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mechanism of NF-κB activation induced by Nod1 and TNFR1 is still unclear although, in both cases, NF-κB activation is mediated by IκB kinases (IKKs) (for review, Ref. 20Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). IKK is a ≈700-kDa complex containing two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ (also called as IKK1 and IKK2, respectively), and the regulatory subunit IKKγ (also called as NEMO, FIP3, and IKKAP1) (20Karin M.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ phosphorylate IκB in a signal-dependent manner, an event leading to degradation of phosphorylated IκB, nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and transcriptional activation of κB site-containing target genes (20Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The structural and functional similarity between Nod1 and Apaf-1 as well as that of RICK and RIP suggest that NF-κB activation induced by Nod1 and the TNFR1 complex may also be mediated by the proximity of RICK and RIP, respectively, through oligomerization of upstream regulators. In this study, we demonstrate that oligomerization of Nod1 induces the proximity of RICK, an event that is sufficient for induction of NF-κB. Like RICK, the enforced oligomerization of RIP also induced NF-κB activation. Both RICK and RIP interacted with IKKγ and subsequent enforced oligomerization of IKK proteins induced NF-κB activation. Thus, we propose a general “induced proximity” model for the induction of NF-κB activation mediated by RIP and RICK which is similar to the mechanism previously suggested for activation of apical caspases during apoptosis. pcDNA3-Myc, pcDNA3-HA, pcDNA3-Fpk3- Myc, pcDNA3-FLAG-RICK, pcDNA3-FLAG-RICK K47M, pcDNA3- FLAG-RIP, RSVMad-3MSS-(IκBα-S32A/S36A), pRK7-FLAG-IKKα, pRK7-FLAG-IKKβ-K44A, pcDNA3-p35, pcDNA3-TRAF2-FLAG, pcDNA3-Caspase-9(C287S)-HA, pEF-BOS-β-gal, and the expression plasmids of tagged wild type (WT) and mutant Nod1, RICK, and RIP proteins have been described (2Inohara N.

Previous studies have shown that NF-κB activation induced by Nod1 can be blocked by dominant negative forms of IKKα, IKKβ, and IκBα (1Bertin J. Nir W.J. Fischer C.M. Tayber O.V. Errada P.R.

However, there is no direct evidence that RelA (p65) mediates κB-dependent transcription induced by Nod1 and RICK. Therefore, we tested if expression of Nod1 in MEFs lacking RelA induces κB site-dependent transcription. Wild type (WT) and RelA-deficient MEFs were co-transfected with expression plasmids producing RICK, Nod1, or Apaf-1-(1–559) as a control, and κB-dependent or control reporter constructs in the presence of baculoviral p35, a general caspase inhibitor. Expression of RICK or Nod1 induced NF-κB activation in WT MEFs but not in RelA-deficient MEFs (Fig. 1 A). This indicates that κB-dependent transcription induced by RICK and Nod1 requires RelA. To test if RICK induces nuclear translocation of NF-κB, including RelA, we assessed the level of nuclear κB site binding activity by the electromobility shift assay. Expression of RICK in 293T cells induced accumulation of κB site binding activity (Fig. 2 B). The DNA-protein complex was abolished in the presence of cold oligonucleotide containing WT but not mutant κB site, suggesting that the DNA-binding protein(s) are NF-κB. Furthermore, the induced DNA-protein complex was shifted by incubation of nuclear extracts with anti-RelA antibody, indicating that the accumulated NF-κB contains RelA. Together these results indicate that NF-κB activation induced by RICK is mediated by RelA. Previous studies showed that NF-κB activation induced by Nod1 could not be blocked by a catalytically inactive mutant of caspase-9 that blocks apoptosis, suggesting that the ability of Nod1 to activate NF-κB is not caused by activation of caspase-9 (2Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). To further assess the role of NF-κB activation in Nod1-mediated apoptosis, we tested whether Nod1 induces apoptosis in RelA-deficient MEFs. Expression of Nod1 and control FADD induced cell death in both WT- and RelA-deficient MEFs (Fig. 1 C). Expression of RICK in RelA-deficient MEFs caused no or little cell death, whereas NF-κB activation induced by RICK was dependent on RelA (Fig. 1 A). These results indicate that the proapoptotic activity of Nod1 is independent from NF-κB activation. Previous studies suggested that the NBD of Apaf-1 mediates its cytochrome c-dependent oligomerization leading to proximity of procaspase-9 molecules and caspase-9 self-activation, a process that is inhibited by the C-terminal WDR of Apaf-1 (6Srinivasula S.M.

Nod1 also self-associates and deletion of its C-terminal LRR region, a putative binding domain for an unknown trigger molecule, results in enhanced NF-κB activation (2Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L.

These observations suggest that Apaf-1 and Nod1 may share a common mechanism for activation of downstream effectors. To begin to test this model, we determined whether the NBD of Nod1 mediates its self-association by an immunoprecipitation assay. FLAG-tagged Nod1 lacking the C-terminal LRRs, Nod1-(1–648), was co-expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged WT and mutant Nod1 proteins. FLAG-Nod1 was co-immunoprecipitated with WT and mutant Nod1 proteins containing the NBD but lacking the CARD and/or LRRs (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, Nod1 containing only the NBD (residues 126–648) associated with Nod1-(1–648), whereas a point mutation in the P-loop of the NBD, K208R, showed reduced ability to associate with Nod1 when compared with WT protein (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the NBD mediates Nod1 oligomerization. Notably, Nod1-(1–648) exhibited greater ability to self-associate than WT Nod1, suggesting that the LRRs play a negative regulatory role in Nod1 self-association, as it was shown for the WDR of Apaf-1 (7Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33489-34494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that Nod1-(1–648) exhibits greater ability to induce NF-κB than WTNod1 (2Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). To determine if Nod1 self-association induces the proximity of RICK molecules, we tested whether Nod1 enhances the interaction between RICK proteins. FLAG-tagged RICK proteins was co-expressed and co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged RICK in the absence and presence of Nod1-(1–648) or Apaf-1-(1–559) as a control. The association between HA-RICK and FLAG-RICK was enhanced by co-expression of Nod1-(1–648) but not by Apaf-1-(1–559) (Fig. 2 C). This suggests that Nod1 induces the proximity of RICK. To determine if Nod1 self-association is sufficient to induce NF-κB activation, we tested whether enforced oligomerization of Nod1 could induce NF-κB activation. A point mutant of Nod1, K208R, which has reduced ability to induce NF-κB activation and self-associate (Ref.2Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, Fig. 2 A), was fused to three tandem repeated dimerization domains of Fpk (Fpk3), which can be oligomerized by the cell-permeable artificial ligand AP1510 (28MacCorkle R.A. Freeman K.W. Spencer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3655-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Expression of the resulting fusion protein, Nod1(K208R)-Fpk3-Myc, induced NF-κB activation in a ligand dependent manner, whereas control Nod1(K208R) did not (Fig.2 D). As expected, WT Nod1 induced NF-κB activation in the presence or absence of the oligomerizer (Fig. 2 D). These results cannot be explained by increased protein expression, as similar levels of Nod1 proteins were detected in the absence and presence of AP1510 (Fig. 2 D). These results suggest that self-association of Nod1 is necessary and sufficient to induce NF-κB activation. We next tested if the proximity of RICK molecules could activate NF-κB. Nod1 associates with RICK through a homophilic CARD interaction (2Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), suggesting that regions of RICK other than its CARD might mediate NF-κB activation. To test if oligomerization of RICK can induce NF-κB activation independently of its association with Nod1, we generated RICK mutant constructs to express its kinase domain and intermediate region but lacking its CARD (RICK-(1–425)), with or without Fpk3, and tested if the mutant RICK proteins could induce NF-κB activation. RICK-(1–425) and RICK-(1–425)-Fpk3-Myc, each lacking the CARD, failed to induce NF-κB activation (Fig.3 B). However, RICK-(1–425)-Fpk3-Myc induced NF-κB activation in the presence of AP1510 (Fig. 3 B), indicating that RICK oligomerization is sufficient for NF-κB activation independently of the Nod1 interaction. To further map the region of RICK that mediates NF-κB activation, we constructed RICK expression plasmids producing its kinase domain (residues 1–292) or the point mutation K47M, which eliminates its kinase activity (3Inohara N. del Peso L. Koseki T. Chen S. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12296-12300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), fused with Fpk3. In contrast to RICK-(1–425)-Fpk3-Myc, RICK-(1–292), and RICK-(1–292)-Fpk3-Myc failed to induce NF-κB activation in the presence of the oligomerizer (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the intermediate region of RICK (residues 293–425) is required for NF-κB activation. On the other hand, the kinase-deficient mutant RICK-(1–425)-Fpk3-Myc-K47M, induced a greatly reduced but significant level of NF-κB activation (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the kinase activity of RICK is important but not essential for NF-κB activation. TNFα is a trimer that induces TNFR1 trimerization and recruitment of RIP to the TNFR1 complex through a homophilic death domain (DD) interaction (18Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5025) Google Scholar). RIP, a RICK-like kinase, requires its intermediate region but not its kinase domain to induce NF-κB activation (Ref. 15Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholarand see below). Therefore, we tested whether oligomerization of RIP, like that of RICK, was sufficient for NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 3 C, a mutant form of RIP lacking the DD (RIP-(1–580)) induced NF-κB activation, but it was about 25-fold less active than WT RIP. Expression of the same RIP mutant fused to Fpk3 exhibited enhanced NF-κB activity in the presence of the oligomerizer (Fig.3 C). Significantly, a RIP mutant lacking the intermediate region and DD, RIP-(1–287), with and without Fpk3, did not induce NF-κB activation in the absence and presence of AP1510 (Fig.3 C). These findings, which are comparable to those shown for RICK, indicate that the enforced oligomerization of the intermediate region, but not the kinase domain is essential for NF-κB activation. To determine if the intermediate region of RIP is sufficient to induce NF-κB activation, expression plasmids of RIP containing the intermediate region alone (residues 288–580), with and without Fpk3 were constructed and their abilities to induce NF-κB activation were tested. The equivalent construct of RICK, residues 293–425, did not express detectable protein when expresssed in cells probably due to instability of the protein and could not be tested. 2I. Inohara and G. Núñez, unpublished results. Expression of RIP-(288–580)-Fpk3-Myc containing the intermediate region fused with Fpk3 induced NF-κB activation in an AP1510-dependent manner, whereas the intermediate region of RIP alone did not (Fig.3 D). Therefore, the intermediate region of RIP is necessary and sufficient to induce NF-κB activation in an oligomerization-dependent manner. Previous studies have shown that RIP binds to IKKγ, a regulatory subunit of the IKK complex which is essential for induction of NF-κB activation by TNFα and interleukin-1 (21Yamaoka S. Courtois G.

Here, we report the isolation and the characterization of a novel member of this family. This channel, called TREK2, is closely related to TREK1 (78% of homology). Its gene is located on chromosome 14q31. TREK2 is abundantly expressed in pancreas and kidney and to a lower level in brain, testis, colon, and small intestine. In the central nervous system, TREK2 has a widespread distribution with the highest levels of expression in cerebellum, occipital lobe, putamen, and thalamus. In transfected cells, TREK2 produces rapidly activating and non-inactivating outward rectifier K+ currents. The single-channel conductance is 100 picosiemens at +40 mV in 150 mm K+. The currents can be strongly stimulated by polyunsaturated fatty acid such as arachidonic, docosahexaenoic, and linoleic acids and by lysophosphatidylcholine. The channel is also activated by acidification of the intracellular medium. TREK2 is blocked by application of intracellular cAMP. As with TREK1, TREK2 is activated by the volatile general anesthetics chloroform, halothane, and isoflurane and by the neuroprotective agent riluzole. TREK2 can be positively or negatively regulated by a variety of neurotransmitter receptors. Stimulation of the Gs-coupled receptor 5HT4sR or the Gq-coupled receptor mGluR1 inhibits channel activity, whereas activation of the Gi-coupled receptor mGluR2 increases TREK2 currents. These multiple types of regulations suggest that TREK2 plays an important role as a target of neurotransmitter action.

They are active at all membrane potentials and display very rapid kinetics of activation and deactivation, and no inactivation. Their widespread tissue distribution suggests that one of their major physiological role is the setting of the resting membrane potential in many different cell types. However, background K+ channels with specific functional and regulatory properties, as well as unique tissue distribution, have now been cloned. These channels could be involved in more specific functions such as epithelial K+ transport and regulation of neuronal and muscular excitability (11Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Kurachi Y. Jan L.Y.

These channels, named TREK11 (TWIK-related K+ channel) and TRAAK (TWIK-related arachidonic acid-stimulated K+ channel), produce quasi-instantaneous currents that are outwardly rectifying in physiological K+gradient. These channels have a low basal activity compared with TASK background channels (3Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

However, they can be strongly activated by application of arachidonic acid. This effect is specific of unsaturated fatty acids. Oleate, linoleate, eicosapentaenoate, and docosahexaenoate all strongly activate TREK1 and TRAAK, whereas saturated fatty acids such as palmitate, stearate, and arachidate are ineffective (6Fink M.

Another efficient way for activating these channels is the application of a stretch to the cell membrane (17Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M.

They are mechano-sensitive K+ channels. Compared with TRAAK, TREK1 has additional features. TREK1 is inhibited by activators of protein kinases C (PKC) and A (PKA). The site for PKA phosphorylation has been localized in the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal part of the channel (17Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). TREK1 but not TRAAK is opened by internal acidification (19Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol.

Lowering pH i shifts the pressure-activation relationships toward positive values and leads to channel opening at atmospheric pressure. TREK1 but not TRAAK is activated by inhalational general anesthetics, halothane and isoflurane, at concentrations used in human general anesthesia (16Patel A.J. Honoré E. Lesage F. Fink M. Romey G.

Another efficient way for activating these channels is the application of a stretch to the cell membrane (17Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M.

They are mechano-sensitive K+ channels. Compared with TRAAK, TREK1 has additional features. TREK1 is inhibited by activators of protein kinases C (PKC) and A (PKA). The site for PKA phosphorylation has been localized in the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal part of the channel (17Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). TREK1 but not TRAAK is opened by internal acidification (19Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol.

Lowering pH i shifts the pressure-activation relationships toward positive values and leads to channel opening at atmospheric pressure. TREK1 but not TRAAK is activated by inhalational general anesthetics, halothane and isoflurane, at concentrations used in human general anesthesia (16Patel A.J. Honoré E. Lesage F. Fink M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Nature Neurosci. 1999; 2: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Finally, TREK1 and TRAAK have different tissue distributions, the expression of TRAAK being more restricted to neuronal cells than TREK1 (2Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C.

This article describes the cloning, the genomic organization, the localization, and the functional characterization of a novel human K+ channel with two pore domains. The molecular and functional properties of this channel indicates that it too belongs to the particular subclass of mechano-sensitive and unsaturated fatty acid-activated K+ channels. TREK2 is more related to TREK1 than to TRAAK, and like TREK1, it is activated by general anesthetics at clinical concentrations. TREK2 is modulated by different types of neurotransmitter receptors.

In particular, marine mammals that use sound to communicate, navigate, and detect predators and prey may try to avoid loud sound sources up to tens of kilometres away1. Here, in a study conducted in cooperation with the US Navy2, we show that the singing behaviour of male humpback whales was altered when they were exposed to LFA (low-frequency active) sonar. As the song of these whales is associated with reproduction3, widespread alteration of their singing behaviour might affect demographic parameters, or it could represent a strategy to compensate for interference from the sonar."

All the WS mutations that have been identified result in a nonsense mutation or frameshift, leading to a predicted truncated protein. Thus, it is thought that the truncated protein fails to enter the nucleus and is subsequently degraded. Immunocytochemical studies have localized the Werner syndrome protein (WRN) in the nucleoli of actively growing human cells, whereas serum deprivation causes a relocalization to the nucleus (14Marciniak R.A.

Genet. 1998; 19: 308-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis of WS, we searched for nuclear factors that associate with the WRN protein. Here we report that WRN interacts with the Ku70/80 heterodimer (Ku), a factor involved in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) (17Ramsden D.A. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 18Lieber M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1323-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Kanaar R.

Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). More importantly, our results show that the exonuclease activity of WRN on 3′-recessed DNA ends is strongly stimulated by Ku. Moreover, in the presence of Ku, WRN can efficiently process both blunt-ended DNA and the 3′-protruding strand of a partial duplex DNA. These results suggest that WRN, through direct physical interaction with the Ku70/80 heterodimer, may be involved in processing of DSBs, providing a link between DNA repair and aging. SF9 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding Flag-tagged WRN. The cells were harvested three days postinfection, and whole cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Flag-tagged WRN or Flag-tagged HCV polymerase were immobilized on anti-Flag beads and then incubated with nuclear extracts from HeLa cells at 4 °C for 1 h. Bound proteins were then eluted from the beads with BCO buffer (1 m KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). The eluted proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and then resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Bound proteins were visualized by silver staining. For protein sequencing, the preparation of the associated proteins was accomplished starting from approximately 10 mg of HeLa nuclear extracts. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. After extensive destaining, the protein bands were excised from the gel and sent to the Biopolymers Facilities (Dr. John Rush, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School) for peptide sequencing. Sixteen peptides derived from the 65-kDa polypeptide (DSLIFLVDASK, DLLAVVFYGTEK, NIYVLQELDNPGAK, ILELDQFK, IMLFTNEDNPHGNDSAK, DTGIFLDLMHLK, KPGGFDISLFYR, DIISIAEDEDLR, VHFEESSK, LEDLLR, TFNTSTGGLLLPSDTK, SQIYGSR, SDSFENPVLQQHFR, ELVYPPDYNPEGK, VEYSEEELK, KQELLEALTK) and ten peptides derived from the 90-kDa polypeptide (HIEIFTDLSSR, SQLDIIIHSLK, LGGHGPSFPLK, LTIGSNLSIR, YGSDIVPFSK, FFMGNQVLK, ANPQVGVAFPHIK, TDTLEDLFPTTK, TLFPLIEAK, AFREEAIK) were sequenced. Recombinant Flag-WRN proteins were expressed with a baculovirus system. Whole cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl). Flag-WRN protein was purified through the DEAE-cellulose column and further purified by affinity chromatography on anti-Flag resin. Recombinant Ku70 bearing an amino-terminal polyhistidine (His) epitope tag and Ku80 baculoviruses were used to co-infect SF9 cells, and 48 h after infection, cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer. Ku70/80 complex was purified by metal affinity (Talon,CLONTECH) and DNA cellulose chromatography. For the purification of Ku80, lysates from insect cells expressing recombinant Ku80 were incubated with immobilized Flag-WRN beads. After extensive washes, bound Ku80 was eluted with BCO buffer. Purified proteins were dialyzed in dialysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 80 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were prepared as described in Ref. 21Comai L. Tanese N. Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-WRN antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Immunoprecipitation products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-WRN and anti-Ku80 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). DNA exonuclease activity was measured with the following DNA substrates: 20-oligomer A1 (CGCTAGCAATATTCTGCAGC), 20-oligomer A2 (GCTGCAGAATATTGCTAGCG) complementary to A1, and 46-oligomer A3 (GCGCGGAAGCTTGGCTGCAGAATATTGCTAGCGGGAAATCGGCGCG) partially complementary to A1. Oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′ end with [32P]ATP. The appropriate oligonucleotides were annealed by boiling and slow cooling to room temperature. Reaction mixtures contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, DNA substrates (∼30 fmol, 100,000 cpm), and 5 ng of WRN protein, 5 ng of Ku70, 5 ng of Ku80, or 5 ng of Ku70/80 in a final volume of 10 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and then the reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 μl of a formamide-dye solution (95% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 0.5% xylene cyanol). After incubation at 95 °C for 3 min, DNA products were resolved by either 12 or 16% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. To identify nuclear proteins that interact with WRN, HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with Flag-tagged WRN protein immobilized on anti-Flag resin. In parallel, HeLa nuclear extracts were also incubated with Flag-tagged HCV polymerase and anti-Flag resin only. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and silver staining revealed that two polypeptides of approximately 65 and 90 kDa (Fig.1 A, lane 2) respectively, were eluted specifically from the Flag-WRN resin. Neither the 65- nor the 90-kDa protein was present in the eluates from the control resins (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and3). Therefore, they are likely to represent specific cellular partners of the WRN protein. To ensure that DNA did not mediate the interaction between WRN and the two polypeptides, the experiment was also carried out with nuclear extracts treated with DNase I, yielding identical results. To identify the two polypeptides, bands were excised from the gel and digested with protease, and the resulting peptides were subjected to electrospray ionization/ion trap mass spectrometry. The results of the peptide sequencing indicated that the 65- and the 90-kDa proteins were identical to human Ku70 and Ku80, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Ku70/80 is a heterodimer with high affinity for DNA ends, and it has been shown to be involved in DNA double strand break repair by non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) and V(D)J recombination (17Ramsden D.A. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 18Lieber M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1323-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J. Gent D. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 483-491Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To determine which subunit of the Ku heterodimer interacts with the WRN protein, we performed co-infection in SF9 cells using recombinant baculoviruses expressing Flag-tagged WRN and either Ku70, Ku80, Ku70/Ku80, or a wild-type baculovirus. After 48 h, cells were lysed and lysates were incubated with anti-Flag resin. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with BCO buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Ku70/80 heterodimer interacted with the WRN protein, as determined by the presence of the 70- and 80-kDa polypeptides in the eluate from the anti-Flag immunoprecipitation (Fig.2, lane 2). Moreover, Ku80 alone also co-immunoprecipitated with WRN (Fig. 2, lane 3). In contrast, Ku70 did not associate with WRN because it was absent in the immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag resin (Fig. 2, lane 4). Thus, Ku80 mediates the molecular interaction between WRN and the Ku heterodimer. To provide further evidence that the WRN protein interacts with Kuin vivo, we immunoprecipitated endogenous WRN from HeLa nuclear extracts using antibodies against the WRN protein. As a control, β-actin antibodies were also used in parallel experiments. Western blot analysis indicated that Ku80 is present in the immunoprecipitation reaction with anti-WRN antibodies but absent from the control immunoprecipitation with β-actin antibodies. This result indicates that Ku80 is associated with the WRN protein in vivo. To define the domain of the WRN protein that interacted with Ku80, recombinant Ku80 was incubated with a series of Flag-tagged WRN deletion mutants. After extensive washing, bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against Ku80. The results of this experiment indicated that a specific region of WRN encompassing the amino-terminal amino acid sequence (amino acid residues 1 to 388) was sufficient for binding to Ku80 (Fig.3). In addition, this region of WRN can efficiently interact with Ku heterodimer (data not shown). In a recent study the carboxyl-terminal region of WRN (amino acids 940 to 1432) was used to isolate Ku from HeLa nuclear extracts, leading to the interpretation that this region of WRN interacts directly with Ku (22Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar). Because WRN can form dimers or higher order multimers (19Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J. Gent D. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 483-491Scopus (458) Google Scholar), it is possible that the reported interaction between the carboxyl-terminal region of WRN and Ku may be mediated by full-length WRN or other uncharacterized cellular proteins. The WRN protein possesses 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity, and this activity has been shown to specifically hydrolyze 3′-recessed strands in a partial DNA duplex (8Huang S. Li B. Gray M. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 9Kamath-Loeb A. Shen J.C. Loeb L. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34145-34150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The finding that the WRN protein interacts with Ku70/80 prompted us to ask whether Ku70/80 affects WRN exonuclease activity. To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA exonuclease assays with recombinant WRN protein in the presence of Ku70, Ku80, or Ku70/80 heterodimer. As previously shown, WRN can weakly hydrolyze 3′-recessed DNA ends (Fig.4 A, lane 4). However, as also shown in a recent report (22Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar), in the presence of Ku70/80 heterodimer, the WRN exonuclease activity was strongly stimulated (Fig. 4 A, lane 7). This dramatic activation was strictly dependent on a functional Ku heterodimer, because in the presence of either Ku70 or Ku80 alone, the stimulation was abolished (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and6). We then examined whether the Ku70/80 heterodimer could also activate the WRN exonuclease activity on blunt-end and 3′-protruding DNA substrates. As reported by others, the WRN protein does not digest either 3′-protruding (Fig. 4 B, lane 4) or blunt-end DNA substrates (Fig. 4 C, lane 4). However, in the presence of a Ku70/80 heterodimer, WRN exonuclease activity was active on both 3′-protruding ends (Fig.4 B, lane 7) and blunt-end DNA molecules (Fig.4 C, lane 7). Therefore, these results indicate that direct interaction between the WRN protein and Ku70/80 strongly stimulates the 3′-exonuclease activity on 3′-recessed DNA substrates. In addition, the presence of Ku70/80 induces rapid processing of blunt end and 3′-protruding end DNA by the WRN exonuclease. The functional interaction between Ku70/80 and WRN protein provides a biochemical basis for the phenotypes of WRN−/− fibroblasts. WRN−/− cells exhibit large DNA deletions and chromosome rearrangements and are characterized by a shortened lifespan. Mouse cells deficient for Ku80 show elevated frequencies of chromosomal aberrations such as breakage, translocation, and aneuploidy (23DiFilippantonio M.J. Zhu J. Chen H.T. Meffre E. Nussenzweig M.C. Max E.E. Ried T. Nussenzweig A. Nature. 2000; 404: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 24Karanjawala Z. Grawunder U. Hsieh C.L. Lieber M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, Ku80 knock out mice display an early onset of age-specific changes that are reminiscent of Werner syndrome patients (25Vogel H. Lim D.S. Karsenty G. Finegold M. Hasty P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10770-10775Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Taken together, these genetic analyses and our biochemical studies strongly support the idea that there is a functional interaction between Ku70/80 and the WRN protein. The finding that WRN binds to Ku70/80 suggests potential cellular functions for this protein. One possible scenario is that WRN is involved in some aspects of DNA DSB repair. In eukaryotic cells, DSBs can be caused by a variety of exogenous and endogenous agents. DSBs pose a major threat to the integrity of the genome, and if left unrepaired, they can cause cell death or neoplasia. DSBs are repaired either by using an intact copy of the broken region as a template (homologous recombination (HR)) or by direct rejoining of the broken ends (NHEJ). Both mechanisms operate in eukaryotic cells; however, it is thought that NHEJ is the prevalent pathway in higher eukaryotes. Many of the proteins involved in HR have been identified. These include Rad50, an ATP-dependent DNA-binding protein, Mre11, a double-stranded DNA 3′-exonuclease and single-stranded endonuclease, and NBS1, a protein that is specifically mutated in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (19Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J. Gent D. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 483-491Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 20Critchlow S. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Mre11 is thought to function in the resection of DSB ends in HR, and the Rad50-Mre11-NBS1 complex has been proposed to serve a crucial function in the recognition of double strand DNA breaks (26Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In contrast to HR, NHEJ does not require homology with a second DNA duplex. Biochemical analyses have established that Ku binds to the ends of broken DNA and plays a direct role in NHEJ (18Lieber M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1323-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J. Gent D. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 483-491Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 20Critchlow S. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Upon binding of Ku to the DNA end, the DNA-dependent protein kinase is recruited to the DNA-Ku complex. DNA-dependent protein kinase can phosphorylate itself and Ku; however the functional significance of these modifications remains to be determined. Most double strand DNA breaks are not blunt ends but have single-stranded overhangs; therefore the DNA ends must be trimmed by exonucleases and/or endonucleases before they can be rejoined (20Critchlow S. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Mre11 has been proposed to play a role in NHEJ in yeast; however it remains to be demonstrated whether it also functions in NHEJ in higher eukaryotes. The WRN protein contains a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity and interacts with Ku in vivo and in vitro; therefore, WRN may be involved in nucleolytic processing of double strand DNA ends. An alternative hypothesis is derived from the observation that the yeast Ku 70/80 heterodimer (yKu) is found associated with the chromosome ends, and it has been proposed that yKu helps cap the telomeres and/or regulating 3′ end processing enzymes (27Tham W.-H. Zakian V.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 34-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). More recently, the Ku70/80 complex has also been proposed to be required for capping the ends of mammalian chromosome (28Hsu H., L. Gilley D. Blackburn E. Chen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12454-12458Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 29Bailey S.M. Meyne J. Chen D., J. Kurimasa A. Li G.C. Lehnert B.E. Goodwin E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the mechanism whereby IL-6 inhibits Dex-induced apoptosis is undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 mediates this protective effect. We show that IL-6 triggers selective activation of SHP2 and its association with RAFTK in Dex-treated MM cells. SHP2 interacts with RAFTK through a region other than its Src homology 2 domains. We demonstrate that RAFTK is a direct substrate of SHP2 both in vitro and in vivo, and that Tyr906in the C-terminal domain of RAFTK mediates its interaction with SHP2. Moreover, overexpression of dominant negative SHP2 blocked the protective effect of IL-6 against Dex-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that SHP2 mediates the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 and suggest SHP2 as a novel therapeutic target in MM.

Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of RAFTK has also been associated with induction of apoptosis (9Xiong W.C. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our recent study demonstrated that RAFTK mediates Dex-induced apoptosis in human multiple myeloma (MM) cells (10Chauhan D.

Importantly, interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibits both Dex-induced RAFTK activation and apoptosis in these cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which IL-6 inhibits Dex-induced apoptosis are undefined. Interleukin-6 binds to its receptor (IL-6R/gp80), which interacts with the signal transducer gp130. The cytoplasmic domain of gp130 contains phosphotyrosine motifs for recruitment of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2, also referred to as SHPTP2 (11Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 12Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). SHP2 is widely expressed and is required as a positive (i.e. signal enhancing) component of growth factor and cytokine signal transduction pathways (13Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin.

Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For example, our prior studies have demonstrated that IL-6 triggers proliferation of MM cells via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which includes SHP2 activation (16Ogata A. Chauhan D. Teoh G. Treon S.P. Urashima M. Schlossman R.L. Anderson K.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2212-2221PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, fibroblasts from SHP2 mutant mice exhibit impaired MAPK activation in response to fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and insulin growth factor (17Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M.

Although SHP2 may directly bind and dephosphorylate cytokine receptors or other cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases (14Streuli M. Curr. Opin.

Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), its role in regulating apoptotic signaling is at present undefined. The present study examined the role of SHP2 in mediating the inhibitory effects of IL-6 on Dex-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate that IL-6 activates SHP2 in MM cells and that treatment of MM cells with IL-6 and Dex induces binding of SHP2 with RAFTK, resulting in dephosphorylation of RAFTK. Importantly, we show that RAFTK is a substrate of SHP2, bothin vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of dominant negative (DN)-SHP2 abrogates the protective function of IL-6 against Dex-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that SHP2 mediates anti-apoptotic signaling and suggest SHP2 as a novel therapeutic target in MM. Human MM.1S (Dex-sensitive) cells (21Moalli P.A. Pillay S.

Total cell lysates were also subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-CPP32 (Transduction Labs) or anti-PKC-δ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). MM.1S cells were transiently transfected using Superfect™ (Quiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) with vector containing green fluorescence protein (GFP) alone or with wild-type-SHP2 (WT-SHP2), DN-SHP2 containing cysteine to serine (Cys → Ser) mutation in the catalytic domain of SHP2, DN-SHP1, or wild-type SHP1.

Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RAFTK, anti-Flag, or anti-SHP2. Additionally, MM.1S cells were cotransfected with Flag-RAFTK and c-Abl or SHP2. Transfected cells were treated with Dex and IL-6, and total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag. The protein precipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl, anti-SHP2, or anti-Flag. To determine whether RAFTK associate with SHP2 in vivo, MM.1S cells were cotransfected with Flag-RAFTK and HA-SHP2-PD (phosphatase-dead) or HA-SHP2-WT and then treated with Dex and IL-6. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr, anti-HA, or anti-Flag. MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with Flag-RAFTK and treated with 10 μM Dex for 12 h. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RAFTK, and immunoprecipitates were incubated with purified SHP2 or phosphatase-dead SHP2 (kindly provided by Dr. Haihua Gu and Benjamin G. Neel, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), SHP1, or PTP1B in an assay buffer containing cold ATP (22Gu H. Griffin J.D. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16421-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The reaction products were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. MM.1S cells were treated with 10 μm Dex and harvested at different time intervals. RAFTK immune complex kinase assays and anti-P-Tyr immunoblotting were performed as described previously (10Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Pandey P. Treon S.P. Teoh G. Rosen S. Krett N. Husson H. Avraham S.

GST fusion proteins (GST·SHP2 and GST·SHP2 (N+C)) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as previosly described (22Gu H. Griffin J.D. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16421-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and eluted by incubating with 20 mm glutathione in 150 mm Nacl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Protein blots on nitrocellulose filters were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-bufferred saline/Tween, incubated with GST·SHP2 and GST·SHP2 (N+C), probed with monoclonal anti-GST (1:1000) or anti-Flag, and developed using appropriate secondary antibodies and ECL. Dual flouresence staining with DNA-binding fluorochromes Hoechst 33342 (HO) and propidium iodide (PI) was used to quantitate the percentage of apoptotic (HO+PI−) cells using flow cytometry (“The Vantage,” Becton Dickinson), as described previously (23Hamel W. Dazin P. Israel M.A. Cytometry. 1996; 25: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Following transfections, genomic DNA was isolated from control and Dex-treated GFP-selected MM.1S cells. Briefly, 1–2 × 106 cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) at 37 °C for 18 h. DNA was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1) and precipitated at −70 °C for 2 h with 0.3 m sodium acetate and 2.5 volume of absolute ethanol. DNA pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml RNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA end labeling was performed as described previously (24Chauhan D. Pandey P. Ogata A. Teoh G. Krett N. Halgren R. Rosen S. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29995-29997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5–1.0 μg of DNA was treated with 5 units of Klenow polymerase with 0.5 uCi of [γ-32P]dCTP in reaction mixture (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2) for 10 min at room temperature and terminated by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by three consecutive precipitation cycles with ammonium acetate/isopropanol, and labeled DNA was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA. Labeled DNA probes were electrophoresed for 2–3 h at 90 V on 1.8% agarose gels, which were dried and exposed for autoradiography. Our recent studies have shown that RAFTK mediates Dex-induced apoptosis in MM cells; treatment of MM.1S cells with 10 μM of Dex induces maximal RAFTK activation as well as apoptosis in MM.1S cells (10Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Pandey P. Treon S.P. Teoh G. Rosen S. Krett N. Husson H. Avraham S. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6733-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because IL-6 can inhibit Dex-induced apoptosis (24Chauhan D. Pandey P. Ogata A. Teoh G. Krett N. Halgren R. Rosen S. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29995-29997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 25Xu F. Sharma S. Gardner S. Tu Y. Raitano A. Sawyers C. Lichtenstein A.

Blood. 1994; 84: 3063-3070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we first examined the effect of IL-6 on Dex-induced activation of RAFTK. MM.1S MM cells were treated with Dex (10 μM) in the presence or absence of IL-6 (100 ng/ml) and harvested at different time intervals. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RAFTK and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. Dex induces tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK in MM.1S cells, which is inhibited by IL-6 (Fig. 1 A, upper panel). Treatment of MM.1S cells with Dex and IL-6 does not alter the levels of RAFTK protein (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). These results, taken together with prior studies (10Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Pandey P.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), demonstrate that IL-6 blocks both Dex-induced RAFTK activation and apoptosis in MM.1S cells. The mechanism whereby IL-6 inhibits Dex-induced RAFTK activation and apoptosis is unknown. We and others have shown that IL-6 induces growth in MM cells via the MAPK pathway, which includes activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (16Ogata A. Chauhan D. Teoh G. Treon S.P. Urashima M. Schlossman R.L. Anderson K.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2212-2221PubMed Google Scholar, 28Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). To determine whether SHP2 may also mediate the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on Dex-induced activation of RAFTK, MM.1S cells were treated with IL-6 for 8, 12, or 24 h, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SHP2, anti-PTP1B, or anti-SHP1 and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. Low to undetectable levels of SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation were observed in cells cultured in media alone (Fig.1 B, upper panel). In contrast, treatment of MM.1S cells with IL-6-induced SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation as early as 8 h; densitometry showed that SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation levels peaked at 12 h (9.0 ± 0.5-fold increase) and declined thereafter (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). There were no associated changes in SHP2 protein levels (Fig. 1 B,lower panel). In contrast, IL-6 failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1B (Fig. 1 C, upper panel) or SHP1 (Fig. 1 D, upper panel). Moreover, IL-6 did not alter the protein levels of PTP1B or SHP1 (lower panels of Fig. 1, C and D, respectively). To determine whether different doses of IL-6 affect SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation, MM.1S cells were treated with various doses of IL-6. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SHP2 and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. Treatment of MM.1S cells with 100 ng/ml IL-6 is associated with maximal activation of SHP2 (data not shown). These findings are in concert with our prior studies, which showed that 100 ng/ml IL-6 induces maximal SHP2 activation (16Ogata A. Chauhan D. Teoh G. Treon S.P. Urashima M. Schlossman R.L. Anderson K.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2212-2221PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether IL-6 induces SHP2 enzymatic activity, SHP2 was immunoprecipitated from control and IL-6-treated MM.1S cells, and phosphatase activity was measured. A 2.1 ± 0.5-fold increase in phosphatase activity was observed in IL-6-treated MM.1S cells relative to untreated cells (p < 0.05, n = 3). Previous studies have demonstrated that SHP2 binds to and dephosphorylates cytokine receptors and other cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (14Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 19Marengere L.E.M. Waterhouse P. Duncan G.S. Mittrucker H.W. Feng G.S. Mak T.W. Science. 1996; 272: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 20Feng G.S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We therefore next determined whether IL-6 induces association of SHP2 and RAFTK. MM.1S cells were treated with Dex in the presence or absence of IL-6 for different time intervals, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SHP2 and immunoblotting with anti-RAFTK (Fig.2 A, upper panel) or immunoprecipitated with anti-RAFTK and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SHP2 (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). Treatment of cells with Dex and IL-6 induces an association between SHP2 and RAFTK, which was maximal at 12 h (Fig. 2, Aand B, upper panels and data not shown). In contrast, treatment of cells with Dex alone fails to induce binding of SHP2 with RAFTK. Equivalent protein loading was confirmed by reprobing the filters with anti-SHP2 or anti-RAFTK (Fig. 2, A andB, lower panels). To further demonstrate the interaction between RAFTK and SHP2, MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with Flag-RAFTK-WT. Following transfection, cells were treated with Dex and IL-6, subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SHP2. The results confirmed that Dex and IL-6 induce association of SHP2 with RAFTK (Fig. 3). Because tyrosine at 906 in the C-terminal domain of RAFTK forms the best consensus site essential for SHP2 binding, we next examined whether mutation of tyrosine 906 abrogates interaction between SHP2 and RAFTK triggered by Dex and IL-6. MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with constructs containing mutations at the tyrosine 906, 881, or 402 residues. Following transfection, cells were treated with Dex and IL-6 and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag. The protein precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SHP2. As can be seen in Fig. 3 A, overexpression of RAFTK-Y906F, but not of RAFTK-Y881F or RAFTK-Y402F, abrogates binding of SHP2 and RAFTK (Fig.3). Reprobing the filters with either anti-RAFTK or anti-Flag demonstrated equal protein levels (Fig. 3, middle andlower panels). Taken together, these findings confirm that treatment of MM.1S cells with Dex and IL-6 induces an association between SHP2 and RAFTK. Moreover, Tyr906 in the C-terminal domain of RAFTK is required for its interaction with SHP2. The interaction between RAFTK and SHP2 was further examined using GST·SHP2 fusion proteins by far Western blot analyses. MM.1S cells were transiently transfected with Flag-RAFTK, Flag-RAFTK-Y906F, or Flag-RAFTK-Y881F mutants and treated with Dex and IL-6. Following treatment, total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, and the filters were incubated with either GST·SHP2-WT fusion protein and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GST or anti-Flag. Incubation of WT-RAFTK was associated with binding to wild-type SHP2 (Fig.4 A, upper panel). Reprobing the filters with anti-Flag demonstrated equal RAFTK protein levels (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). We next determined whether association of SHP2 with RAFTK is SH2-dependent. A similar experiment, as described above, was performed, and the filter was incubated with GST·SHP2 (N+C), which contains both the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of SHP2. The results demonstrate that GST·SHP2 (N+C) fails to bind WT-RAFTK (Fig. 4 B, upper panel). Total cell lysates from Baf3-p210-transfromed cells served as a positive control demonstrating binding of GST·SHP2-(N+C) to 97-kilodalton protein, as previously shown (22Gu H. Griffin J.D. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16421-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Reprobing the filter with anti-Flag demonstrated equal RAFTK protein levels (Fig.4 B, lower panel). Probing similar blots with GST alone revealed no reactive bands. These data are consistent with recent findings (29Tang H. Zhao Z. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8389-8396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and further support that SH2 domains of SHP2 are not essential for the interaction of RAFTK with SHP2. To determine whether other SH2 domain-containing proteins associate with RAFTK, MM.1S cells were cotransfected with Flag-RAFTK, c-Abl, or SHP2. Transfected cells were treated with Dex and IL-6, and total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag. The protein precipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl, anti-SHP2, or anti-Flag. SHP2, but not c-Abl, associated with RAFTK (Fig. 4 C). To define the functional significance of SHP2 and RAFTK complex formation, we next asked whether SHP2 affects Dex-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. RAFTK was immunopurified from Dex-treated MM.1S cells transfected with WT-RAFTK and incubated with purified wild-type SHP2 protein (SHP2-WT) or SHP2-PD in the presence of ATP. RAFTK tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. As can be seen in Fig.5 A, upper panel, incubation of immunopurified RAFTK with SHP2-WT, but not SHP2-PD, inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. Immunoblotting with anti-Flag confirmed equivalent RAFTK protein levels (Fig.5 A, lower panel). Because purified SHP2 dephosphorylates RAFTK in vitro, we next asked whether dephosphorylation of RAFTK affects its kinase activity. To address this issue, we first incubated RAFTK immunoprecipitated from Dex-treated MM.1S cells with either SHP2-WT or SHP2-PD in the presence of ATP. After washing, RAFTK activity was measured in a kinase reaction containing [γ-32P]ATP, with GST·HEF as a substrate (10Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Pandey P. Treon S.P. Teoh G. Rosen S. Krett N. Husson H. Avraham S. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6733-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 C, SHP2-WT, but not SHP2-PD, inhibited RAFTK-mediated phosphorylation of GST·HEF. Taken together, these data indicate that 1) RAFTK is a substrate of SHP2 in vitro and 2) dephosphorylation of RAFTK by SHP2 inhibits its kinase activity. To determine whether SHP2-related proteins such as SHP1 and PTP1B also regulate RAFTK, we performed RAFTK in vitrodephosphorylation assays using purified SHP1 or PTP1B. Cells were transiently transfected with Flag-RAFTK and treated with Dex. Anti-Flag immunoprecipitates were resuspended in buffer containing ATP and purified SHP1, PTP1B, or SHP2. Both SHP1 and SHP2, but not PTP1B, dephosphorylate RAFTK in vitro (Fig. 5 B). These data are consistent with our prior study suggesting that RAFTK is also an in vitro substrate of SHP1 (30Kumar S. Avraham S. Bharti A. Goyal J. Pandey P. Kharbanda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30657-30663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate SHP2-mediated dephosphorylation of RAFTK in response to Dex and IL-6, MM.1S cells were cotransfected with Flag-RAFTK and HA-SHP2-WT or HA-SHP2-PD and then treated with Dex and IL-6. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr, anti-HA, or anti-Flag. Expression of SHP2-PD resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK, whereas expression of SHP2-WT significantly abrogates RAFTK tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5 D). The filters were stripped and reprobed with anti-HA or anti-Flag. No alteration in the protein levels of SHP2 or RAFTK were observed (Fig. 5 D, lower panel, and data not shown, respectively). These findings suggest that RAFTK is a substrate of SHP2 in vivo. We next directly assayed the functional significance of the interaction between SHP2 and RAFTK in mediating the protective effect of IL-6 against Dex-induced apoptosis. MM.1S cells were transiently cotransfected with GFP and either vector alone or DN-SHP2. GFP positive cells were selected, treated with Dex in the presence or absence of IL-6, and assayed for apoptosis by both DNA fragmentation and flow cytometric analysis. The genomic DNA was end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, and DNA fragmentation was assessed by autoradiography. Dex treatment of cells overexpressing vector alone induced DNA fragmentation, which was markedly reduced in the presence of IL-6 (Fig. 6 A, upper panel). In contrast, IL-6 failed to rescue Dex-induced apoptosis in cells overexpressing DN-SHP2. Similar results were obtained using PI and HO dual staining to determine the percentage for PI− and HO+ apoptotic cells (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). To further confirm the role of SHP2 in conferring resistance to Dex-induced apoptosis, we transiently transfected MM.1S cells with GFP and either vector alone or WT-SHP2, treated selected GFP positive cells with Dex, and assessed for apoptosis. Overexpression of WT-SHP2 significantly inhibits Dex-induced apoptosis, confirmed both by DNA fragmentation and percentage of PI− HO+ cells (Fig. 6 B,upper and lower panels). To confirm the selective inhibitory effect of SHP2, MM.1S cells were also transiently transfected with DN-SHP1 and similarly treated. As can be seen in Fig.6 B, upper and lower panels, IL-6 blocks Dex-induced apoptosis in cells overexpressing DN-SHP1 but not in cells overexpressing DN-SHP2. To determine whether SHP1-WT affect Dex-induced apoptosis, MM.1S cells were transiently cotransfected with vectors containing GFP and SHP2 or SHP1. GFP positive cells were selected and treated with Dex. Following treatment, cells were analyzed for apoptosis by DNA fragmentation and propidium iodide staining. Overexpression of SHP2, but not SHP1, blocks Dex-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6 B). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that SHP2 specifically regulate RAFTK-mediated apoptosis. To further confirm the role of SHP2 in mediating the protective effect of IL-6 against Dex-induced apoptosis, we determined the effect of SHP2 blockade on Dex-induced proteolytic cleavage of CPP32 and its substrate PKC-δ, additional hallmarks of apoptosis (31Liu X.

GFP positive cells were treated with Dex and IL-6, and total lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-CPP32 or anti-PKC-δ. IL-6 significantly inhibits Dex-induced cleavage of CPP32 and PKC-δ in cells overexpressing vector alone; however, IL-6 failed to block cleavage of CPP32 and PKC-δ in cells expressing DN-SHP2 (Fig.6 C). Our prior studies have established an obligatory role for RAFTK in Dex-induced apoptosis as well as the protective effect conferred by IL-6 (10Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Pandey P. Treon S.P. Teoh G.

By contrast, γ-irradiation, UV, or Fas is not associated with activation of RAFTK, and IL-6 fails to block apoptosis of MM cells triggered by γ-irradiation or UV (10Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Pandey P.

IL-6 uses Janus tyrosine kinase- signal transducers and activators of transcription and RAS-dependent MAPK signaling cascades to mediate biologic sequelae (33Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5238-5266Google Scholar, 34Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Anderson K. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 10-22PubMed Google Scholar). Prior studies have demonstrated that IL-6 activates Janus tyrosine kinases, signal transducers and activators of transcription-3, and SHP2 as well as MAPK in MM cells (16Ogata A. Chauhan D. Teoh G. Treon S.P. Urashima M. Schlossman R.L. Anderson K.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2212-2221PubMed Google Scholar, 35Anderson K. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 10-22PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study reported interaction between Janus tyrosine kinases and SHP2 (36Yin T. Shen R. Feng G.S. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The interplay between SHP2 and Janus tyrosine kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling molecules in response to IL-6 stimulation of MM cells remains to be defined. Moreover, it is not yet known which tyrosine residue(s) in SHP2 are phosphorylated upon IL-6 stimulation of MM cells. The identification of IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation sites in SHP2 will further elucidate the role of SHP2 in mediating its anti-apoptotic effects. In the present study, we show that IL-6 activates SHP2, which then associates with RAFTK in Dex-treated MM cells. SHP2 interacts with RAFTK through a region other than its SH2 domains. We demonstrate that RAFTK is a substrate of SHP2 and that Tyr906 in the C-terminal domain of RAFTK mediates its interaction with SHP2. Furthermore, overexpression of DN-SHP2 blocked the protective effect of IL-6 against Dex-induced apoptosis. Collectively, the present model suggests that the IL-6-activated SHP2 dephosphorylate RAFTK, thereby blocking Dex-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7). These studies provide the framework for novel treatment approaches targeting SHP2 in MM."

Stimulation with orexin-A led to pronounced Ca2+elevations with an EC50 around 1 nm. When the extracellular [Ca2+] was reduced to a submicromolar concentration, the EC50 was increased 100-fold. Similarly, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production in the presence of 1 mm external Ca2+ was about 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive to orexin-A stimulation than in low extracellular Ca2+. The shift in the potency was not caused by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ but by a requirement of extracellular Ca2+ for production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Fura-2 experiments with the “Mn2+-quench technique” indicated a direct activation of a cation influx pathway by OX1 receptor independent of Ca2+ release or pool depletion. Furthermore, depolarization of the cells to +60 mV, which almost nullifies the driving force for Ca2+ entry, abolished the Ca2+ response to low concentrations of orexin-A. The results thus suggest that OX1 receptor activation leads to two responses, (i) a Ca2+ influx and (ii) a direct stimulation of phospholipase C, and that these two responses converge at the level of phospholipase C where the former markedly enhances the potency of the latter.

Interestingly, the response in neurons is partially dependent on extracellular Ca2+, which may suggest that the receptors are connected to a Ca2+influx pathway in neurons (6van den Pol A.N. Gao X.B. Obrietan K. Kilduff T.S. Belousov A.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7962-7971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several different pathways for receptor-stimulated Ca2+ entry have been suggested based on functional studies with other G protein-coupled receptors. Suggested pathways include store-operated Ca2+ channels, second messenger-operated channels, as well as Ca2+-activated Ca2+ channels (reviewed in Refs. 8Tsunoda Y. J. Recept. Signal Transduct.

The aim of this study was to examine in detail the Ca2+mobilizing actions of orexins on recombinant OX1 receptors expressed in CHO1-K1 cells. The results reveal the presence of a novel amplification mechanism at the level of phospholipase C that is dependent on activation of Ca2+ influx pathway upstream of phospholipase C. To prepare the CHO-hOX1-C1 cells used in this study CHO-K1 cells were transfected with a bicistronic vector containing the coding sequence of human OX1 receptor as described previously for chemokine receptors (10Samson M.

Neomycin resistant clones were then isolated by limited dilution. They were grown in nutrient mixture (Ham's F-12) medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, United Kingdom) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G (Sigma), 80 units/ml streptomycin (Sigma), 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in an air ventilated humidified incubator in 260-ml plastic culture flasks (75-cm2 bottom area; Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark). For Ca2+, inositol phosphate and IP3 measurements in suspension, the cells were grown on circular plastic culture dishes (inner diameter, 94 mm; Nunc). For microfluorometry, the cells were grown on circular glass coverslips (inner diameter, 25 mm). EGTA and probenecid (p-[dipropylsulfamoyl]benzoic acid) were purchased from Sigma and thapsigargin from RBI (Natick, MA). Fura-2, fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester, and fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR) and human orexin-A and orexin-B from Peninsula Laboratories Europe Ltd.

The TES-buffered medium (TBM) consisted of 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 4.2 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, 1 mmprobenecid, and 20 mm TES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 was used to monitor changes in intracellular Ca2+ instead of fura-2 since it has a higherK d (11Kao J.P. Harootunian A.T. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8179-8184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which allows more accurate estimation of the very high Ca2+ elevations induced by OX1receptor stimulation. The cells were harvested using phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 g/liter EDTA, loaded with fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (4 μm, 20 min, 37 °C) in TBM, and stored on ice as pellets (medium removed). For the measurement of intracellular free calcium, one pellet was resuspended in TBM at 37 °C. The fluorescence was monitored in a stirred quartz microcuvette in the thermostated cell holder of either a Hitachi F-2000, F-4000, or PTI QuantaMaster fluorescence spectrophotometer at the wavelengths 480 nm (excitation) and 540 nm (emission). Experiments were calibrated by adding 60 μg/ml digitonin, which gives the maximum value of fluorescence, and 10 mm EGTA, which gives the minimum value of fluorescence. The leaked fluo-3 was measured in separate experiments by adding 10 mm EGTA, which chelates Ca2+ bound to extracellular fluo-3. The corrected fluorescence values and theK d = 400 nm (11Kao J.P. Harootunian A.T. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8179-8184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to calculate [Ca2+]i. In each batch of cells, all the experiments were performed at least in duplicate. For microfluorometric Ca2+ measurements, fura-2 was used instead of fluo-3 since it enables ratiometric Ca2+measurement. The coverslips with cells were loaded with 1 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (30 min, 37 °C) in a buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 3 mm glucose, 1 mm probenecid, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), rinsed with fura-2-free medium and used as the bottom of an open 0.4-ml chamber. The chamber was placed in a thermostat-controlled holder (32 °C) on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon) and perfused at a rate of 0.7 ml/min with the loading medium lacking fura-2. The cells were excited at 340/380 nm using a monochromator (TILL Photonics, Munich, Germany) that was controlled by EPC 9 fura extension software (HEKA Elektronik GmbH, Lambrecht, Germany). Fluorescence signals were detected by a photomultiplier mounted to a viewfinder (TILL Photonics) and saved by the X-chart version of the EPC 9 software (HEKA). A new reading (340/380) was achieved every 0.12 s by interpolation. Calibration constants for fura-2 were determined according to (12Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Orexin-A was applied with a puff-pipette placed 30–50 μm away from the recording cell. Patch-clamp experiments in the whole-cell configuration were performed using the same setup as above. Recordings were performed with 2–4-megohm pipettes (Kimax-51; Kimble, Vineland, NJ) and an EPC 9 patch-clamp amplifier together with Pulse software (HEKA). Cells were held at a holding potential of −50 mV. Capacitative transient and series resistance were continuously monitored and compensated for. The extracellular solution was as above. The internal pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm Mg-ATP, 0.1 mm fura-2, and 10 mmHepes adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. The osmolarity of all solutions utilized in the patch-clamp experiments was 295 ± 5 mosmol/liter. For Ca2+ imaging, fura-2 was used instead of fluo-3 since it enables simultaneous measurement of Ca2+-dependent fluorescence increase (at 340 nm) and Mn2+-dependent fluorescence quenching (at 360 nm). The coverslips with CHO-hOX1-C1 cells were loaded with fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (4 μm, 20 min, 37 °C) in TBM, rinsed with nominally Ca2+-free TBM, and used as the bottom of an open 1-ml chamber. The chamber was placed in a thermostat-controlled holder (37 °C) on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon). The additions in the chamber were made by perfusion or by removing 0.35 ml of the total volume of 1 ml (of nominally Ca2+-free TBM), mixing with the reagents to be added and re-adding into the chamber. The cells were excited by alternating 340 and 360 nm light with two monochromators, a chopper under the control of a PTI Image Master (version 1.4 for Windows), a dichroic mirror (DM400, Nikon), and the emission measured through the dichroic mirror and a 470-nm barrier filter with a PTI IC-200 CCD camera. A new ratioed (340/380) image was achieved every second by interpolation. Saved data was later analyzed with FeliX (version 1.4; PTI).

CHO-hOX1-C1 cells on culture dishes were loaded with 3 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol for 20 h in the culture medium. For the experiments, they were detached as for Ca2+measurement in suspension, washed and suspended in TBM supplemented with 10 mm LiCl. After a 10-min preincubation in this solution in 37 °C, the cells were stimulated with orexin-A, ionomycin, or thapsigargin. When relevant, EGTA was added 30 s before the stimulation. After 5 or 20 min of stimulation, the cells were rapidly spun down and the reactions were stopped by adding 200 μl of 0.1 m NaOH and vortexing. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the solutions were neutralized with 80 μl of 0.2m formic acid. The debris were removed, and the total inositol phosphate fraction was isolated with anion exchange chromatography (14Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). The radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. CHO-hOX1-C1 cells were cultured and detached as for Ca2+ measurements in suspension. They were spun down, washed once with TBM, and resuspended in TBM, and the cell number was adjusted to 107 cells/ml by counting in a Bürker chamber. The extraction of IP3was performed using the method of Palmer et al. (15Palmer S. Hawkins P.T. Michell R.H. Kirk C.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) essentially as described (16Kukkonen J.P. Näsman J. Ojala P. Oker-Blom C. Åkerman K.E.O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 593-601PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reactions (either basal level, orexin-A ± Ca2+ for 7 s, 1.5 mm EGTA for 1 min, or 1.5 mm EGTA for 1 min + orexin-A for 7 s) were terminated by adding ice-cold perchloric acid to a final concentration of 4% (v/v). The precipitate was sedimented by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were neutralized with 1.5 m KOH containing 60 mm Hepes, and 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.6) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 m (final pH ≈ 8.6). The resulting KClO4 sediment was removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The IP3 concentration of the samples was determined using [3H]IP3 radioreceptor assay kit (NEN Life Science Products). The assay was performed as described in Ref. 16Kukkonen J.P. Näsman J. Ojala P. Oker-Blom C. Åkerman K.E.O. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 593-601PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, the standards, blanks (0.4% (w/v) inositol hexakisphosphate, to determine nonspecific binding), and the samples were incubated with the receptor preparation and [3H]IP3 for 1 h on ice. The tubes were spun at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the resulting pellets dissolved in 50 μl of 0.15 m NaOH. The NaOH/protein solutions were transferred to scintillation vials together with 2 × 100 μl of water used to wash each tube, and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The extracellular free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]o) was calculated using the freeware Bound and Determined 3.0 (17Marks P.W. Maxfield F.R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and controlled by measurement with fura-2 (free acid form). Addition of 1.5 mm EGTA in TBM gave an approximate free [Ca2+] of 140 nm. Nominally Ca2+-free buffer (used in microfluorometric Ca2+ measurements) had a Ca2+concentration of approximately 1 μm. Addition of 1 mm EGTA resulted in subnanomolar free [Ca2+], which is approximated with 0 Ca2+ in the text and in the figure legend. Addition of 1 nm orexin-A to CHO-hOX1-C1 cells led to an immediate increase in intracellular free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) followed by a decay and a stable elevation of [Ca2+]i(Fig. 1 A). When [Ca2+]o was reduced to 140 nm from 1 mm by addition of 1.5 mmEGTA immediately prior to addition of orexin-A, the [Ca2+]i response was abolished but a robust [Ca2+]i elevation was seen when 1.5 mm Ca2+ was added to saturate the EGTA and restore the [Ca2+]o of 1 mm (Fig. 1 B). A higher concentration of orexin-A (100 nm) caused an increase in [Ca2+]i also when [Ca2+]o was reduced to 140 nm (Fig. 1 C). To test whether the inhibitory effect of EGTA on the orexin-A response was caused by Ca2+pool depletion by EGTA, 2 μm thapsigargin was added to the cells in the presence of 1 mm and 140 nmextracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1, D and E). No depletion was observed since a response of similar magnitude was obtained under both conditions. A concentration-response relation for the effect of orexin-A at normal and low [Ca2+]o is shown in Fig.2. In 1 mm[Ca2+]o, orexin-A dose-dependently increased [Ca2+]i with an EC50value of 1 nm. In 140 nm[Ca2+]o, the EC50value was around 80 nm. The concentration dependence of the spike response seen upon Ca2+ readdition showed a bell-shaped curve with a half-maximal rising phase at 3 nmand a half-maximal falling phase at about 50 nm orexin-A. Fig. 2 A also shows the response to 2 μmthapsigargin in the presence of 140 nm external Ca2+. When added after 1 nm orexin-A challenge in 1 mm Ca2+, the response to thapsigargin in 140 nm Ca2+ was the same as in control conditions, indicating that no change in the thapsigargin-releasable pool had occurred. When added after 100 nm orexin-A, the release by thapsigargin was almost completely abolished, indicating that the pool had been almost totally discharged. The concentration-response relation for orexin-A-induced accumulation (20 min) of total inositol phosphates in the presence of Li+ is shown in Fig. 2 B. In 1 mm Ca2+ a concentration-dependent increase in inositol phosphates was seen with an EC50 around 1.5 nm. However, when the accumulation was measured in the presence of 140 nmCa2+, no detectable accumulation could be seen. Ionomycin (1 μm) increased the total inositol phosphate accumulation in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ by 72.4 ± 4.7%, whereas thapsigargin (2 μm) did not (5.3 ± 0.6%; mean ± S.E., n = 3). In the presence of 140 nm Ca2+, neither of these compounds affected the accumulation of inositol phosphates (3.5 ± 0.3% and −9.5 ± 0.9%, respectively). The concentration-response relation for the rapid (7 s) orexin-A-induced IP3 accumulation in similar conditions is shown in Fig. 2 C. Reduction of [Ca2+]o to 140 nmcaused a considerable shift in the concentration-response relation. Whenever 1 mm [Ca2+]owas restored after orexin-A in conditions similar to those for the fluo-3 experiments in Figs. 1 B and 2 A, the concentration-response relation was almost identical to that in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ except that the maximum response might have been lower. Thus, the IP3 response has a similar extracellular Ca2+ dependence as the Ca2+ response except that the orexin-A has a 10-fold lower potency for the IP3 response as compared with the Ca2+ response. To investigate whether phospholipase C is involved in the external Ca2+-dependent response to 1 nm orexin-A, the effect of the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 was tested. This compound, however, caused a considerable rise in [Ca2+]i on its own at a concentration as low as 1 μm (data not shown). This nonspecific effect is in line with other studies (18Taylor C.W. Broad L.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 370-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and thus this inhibitor could not be used to probe a role of phospholipase C activation. A bell-shaped relation was observed when the stable phase of Ca2+ elevation seen in Fig. 1 A was plotted as a function of the orexin-A concentration (Fig.3 A). Thus, a more stable phase of the signal dominates at low concentrations of orexin-A as compared with high concentrations where this phase is virtually absent. A similar result was obtained with orexin-B although, as reported earlier for the OX1 receptor (1Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G.P. Wilson S. Arch J.R. Buckingham R.E. Haynes A.C. Carr S.A. Annan R.S. McNulty D.E. Liu W.S. Terrett J.A. Elshourbagy N.A. Bergsma D.J. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1998; 92: 573-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3140) Google Scholar), the potency of this ligand was 10 times lower than that of orexin-A (data not shown).Figure 1Representative fluorescence traces of Ca2+ elevations measured with fluo-3 in the suspensions of CHO-hOX1 cells.

Mean ± S.E. of responses in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ from determinations with three batches of cells performed as in Fig. 1 A are given.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to further characterize the Ca2+dependence of the response to orexin-A, the stimulation was performed with a puff-pipette in a close contact with the cell being monitored. Cells stimulated with 10 nm orexin-A in Ca2+-free conditions did, as expected (see Fig.2 A), not respond with an elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig.4 A). If the bath perfusion immediately after the challenge was changed to a solution containing 2 mm Ca2+, there was an immediate robust increase in [Ca2+]i even though orexin-A was no longer present in the extracellular solution (Fig.4 A). If 2 mm Ca2+ was present together with orexin-A in the puff-pipette, the cells perfused either in 0 or 2 mm extracellular Ca2+ responded to the orexin-A-Ca2+-challenge with an immediate robust increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.4 B). Stimulation with the vehicle instead of orexin-A in any of these cases did not cause any response (data not shown). This indicates that the absence of orexin-A response under Ca2+-free conditions is not caused by the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, but by the absence of the Ca2+ influx. Orexin-A response was also investigated in single cells under voltage-clamp conditions. When the normal holding potential of −50 mV was changed to +60 mV, which nearly nullifies the driving force for Ca2+ influx, the orexin-A response was abolished. A rapid change back to −50 mV in the presence of continued orexin-A application resulted in an immediate Ca2+ elevation. This indicates that, at this orexin-A concentration, the trigger for the Ca2+ response is a Ca2+ influx, most likely a channel. 2-APB has been reported to block IP3-mediated Ca2+ mobilization without affecting receptor-dependent IP3 production (19Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows that 2-APB did not affect the orexin-A-induced Ca2+ elevation in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. However, in the presence of 140 nm Ca2+, the Ca2+ response was almost completely abolished (Fig. 5 B). Xestospongin C has been shown to block some subtypes of the IP3 receptor. For blocking in intact cells, this compound requires preincubation for about 20 min (20Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 21Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Therefore, these experiments were performed in suspension. Cell suspensions were preincubated for 20 min with 20 μm xestospongin C before challenge with 3 or 100 nm orexin-A. In the presence of 1 mmextracellular Ca2+, xestospongin C did not affect Ca2+ at either concentration of orexin-A. However, with 140 nm extracellular Ca2+, the response to 100 nm orexin-A was almost totally blocked. Thus, both 2-APB and xestospongin C give the same result, e.g. have no effect in the presence of 1 mm extracellular Ca2+ but block the orexin-A response in the presence of 140 nm extracellular Ca2+. Many of the Ca2+ influx pathways activated by G protein-coupled receptors are also permeable to Mn2+, and quenching of the fluorescence of fura-2 by this cation can be used for monitoring the activation of such pathways (22Merritt J.E. Jacob R. Hallam T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1522-1527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were challenged with different concentrations of orexin-A in nominally Ca2+-free solutions to see whether orexin-A activates an influx pathway at concentrations that do not cause intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. The fura-2 response in individual cells was viewed by monitoring the fluorescence at 340 nm (to detect the fura-2-Ca2+ complex) and 360 nm (insensitive to changes in Ca2+ but sensitive to Mn2+ binding). 100 nm orexin-A caused a Ca2+ release as indicated by the fluorescence increase at 340 nm, whereas no response was seen at 360 nm (Fig. 6 A). A further addition of 100 μm Mn2+ quenched the fura-2 fluorescence at both wavelengths, indicating an influx through,e.g., store-operated Ca2+ channels. The addition of 100 μm Mn2+ before stimulation with 100 nm orexin-A did not result in any fluorescence response (Fig. 6 B). After the addition of orexin-A, however, a similar Ca2+ release and Mn2+ influx, as in Fig. 6 A, was seen. Simultaneous addition of 100 nm orexin-A and 100 μm Mn2+resulted in rapid fluorescence increase at 340 nm and a decrease at 360 nm (Fig. 6 C). Simultaneous addition of 100 μmMn2+ and 1 nm orexin-A resulted in a quenching of a the fluorescence at both wavelengths (Fig. 6 D). A further addition of 10 nm orexin-A led to a further quenching at both wavelengths. This indicates that 1 and 10 nm orexin-A, which do not activate Ca2+ release in these nominally Ca2+-free conditions, still activate a cation influx pathway seen as Mn2+ influx. Thapsigargin caused a transient and sustained Ca2+ elevation in the presence of 1 mmextracellular Ca2+ (Figs. 1 D and7 A), whereas the latter phase was absent in the presence of 140 nm extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1 E), indicating that the sustained phase is dependent on extracellular Ca2+. When added during the sustained phase of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ elevation, orexin-"

Activation of prophenol oxidase in arthropods is important in host defense. However, the prophenol oxidase-activating system remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we show that the coagulation cascade of the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus is linked to prophenol oxidase activation, with the oxygen carrier hemocyanin functioning as a substitute for prophenol oxidase. Tachypleus clotting enzyme functionally transforms hemocyanin to phenol oxidase, and the conversion reaches a plateau at 1:1 stoichiometry without proteolytic cleavage. The active site-masked clotting enzyme also has the same effect, suggesting that complex formation of the clotting enzyme with hemocyanin is critical for the conversion.

Invertebrates lack adaptive immunity and must rely completely on innate immune systems for host defense (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). Two such systems, the blood (hemolymph) coagulation system in the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus and the prophenol oxidase-activating system in insects and crustaceans, are sensitive nonself-recognizing cascades triggered by microbial cell wall constituents (2Iwanaga S.

In invertebrates, two kinds of protease cascades have been well characterized at the molecular level, the Tachypleus coagulation cascade (2Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem.

Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The structural similarity of their target proteins, a Tachypleus clottable protein coagulogen and a Drosophila Toll ligand Spätzle, as well as the sequence homology between the serine proteases of the two cascades, suggests that these two functionally different cascades may have a common origin (6Bergner A.

Factor C is a biosensor against lipopolysaccharides and is autocatalytically activated to factor C̄, which then activates factor B and, in turn, factorB̄ converts the proclotting enzyme to the clotting enzyme. Another biosensor, factor G, is activated in the presence of β-1,3-glucans to factor Ḡ, which directly activates the proclotting enzyme. In insects and crustaceans, the prophenol oxidase activation system is an important part of the host defense, where it functions to detect and kill invading pathogens, as well as to synthesize melanin for wound healing and encapsulation of pathogens (3Ratcliffe N.A.

Prophenol oxidase-activating enzymes recently cloned from insects have been shown to be homologous to Tachypleusclotting enzyme, factor B̄, or Drosophila Easter (9Muta T. Hashimoto R. Miyata T.

In the American horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemusthe induction of prophenol oxidase activity in the blood is evident by treatment with either detergents or lipids (14Nellaiappan K. Sugumaran M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 133B: 163-168Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but prophenol oxidase(s) from horseshoe crabs has not been identified at the molecular level. Here we show that the Tachypleuscoagulation cascade is linked to prophenol oxidase activation, and we propose that the two host defense systems of blood coagulation and prophenol oxidase activation have evolved from a common ancestral protease cascade.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTachypleus coagulation factors were tested to determine whether they could produce phenol oxidase activity in plasma free from hemocytes, using 4-methylcatechol as substrate (Fig.1 A). The clotting enzyme and factor B̄ efficiently produced phenol oxidase activity. However, factor C̄ and factor Ḡ, as well as trypsin, could not significantly produce phenol oxidase activity, indicating that the specific proteases are required for the production of phenol oxidase activity in Tachypleus plasma.The phenol oxidase activity in plasma disappeared with the removal of hemocyanin by ultracentrifugation, suggesting thatTachypleus hemocyanin is originally involved in the prophenol oxidase-activating system. Prophenol oxidases and hemocyanins display significant sequence similarity, and both contain two functional copper-binding sites capable of reversibly binding an oxygen molecule (21Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar). Tachypleus hemocyanin is composed of at least six subunits having the same molecular mass of 70 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but that are separable by an anion-exchanger column chromatography (15Takagi T. Nemoto T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1980; 87: 1785-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All the fractions, each containing different subunit(s), expressed phenol oxidase activity (Fig. 1 B). Fraction I containing the α-subunit was used for the subsequent experiments, since its primary sequence is already known (24Linzen B. Soeter N.M. Riggs A.F. Schneider H.-J. Schartau W. Moor M.D. Yokota E. Behrens P.Q. Nakashima H. Takagi T. Nemoto T. Vereijken J.M. Bak H.J. Beintema J.J. Volbeda A. Gaykema W.P.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1985; 229: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).Under the physiological conditions arthropod prophenol oxidases require a proteolytic cleavage for activation by a specific protease; the freshwater crayfish prophenol oxidase with a molecular mass of 76 kDa is converted into an active form with 62 kDa by the prophenol oxidase-activating enzyme (25Aspan A. Huang T.S. Cerenuis L. Söderhäll K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The tarantula Eurypelma californicum hemocyanin was recently found to express phenol oxidase activity after limited proteolysis with trypsin or chymotrypsin (26Decker H. Rimke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25889-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, the α-subunit treated with the clotting enzyme maintained the native molecular mass of 70 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis during incubation for 1 h (Fig.2 A), despite the fact that the aliquots showed significant phenol oxidase activity (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, amino-terminal sequence analysis of the α-subunit after the 1-h incubation showed that the first 10 residues (Thr-Ile-Lys-Glu-Lys-Gln-Ala-Ser-Ile-Leu-) were consistent with those of the native protein (24Linzen B. Soeter N.M. Riggs A.F. Schneider H.-J. Schartau W. Moor M.D. Yokota E. Behrens P.Q. Nakashima H. Takagi T. Nemoto T. Vereijken J.M. Bak H.J. Beintema J.J. Volbeda A. Gaykema W.P.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1985; 229: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), indicating that proteolytic cleavage was not required for the functional conversion of hemocyanin to phenol oxidase.Figure 2Non-proteolytic conversion of hemocyanin to phenol oxidase.

The background activity of the unactivated α-subunit is shown by adotted line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The stoichiometry of the non-proteolytic conversion was estimated by increasing the amounts of the clotting enzyme under a constant concentration of the α-subunit. The clotting enzyme transformed the α-subunit in a dose-dependent manner, and the resulting phenol oxidase activity reached a plateau at 1:1 molar ratio (Fig.2 C). The specific activity was 37 ± 8 nmol/min/mg, equivalent to that of the insect Holotrichia diomphaliaphenol oxidase, 47 nmol/min/mg, calculated from the published data (27Kwon T.H. Lee S.Y. Lee J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 7: 90-97Google Scholar). Typical inhibitors for arthropod phenol oxidases, such as phenylthiourea (12.5 mm) and EDTA (25 mm), completely inhibited the activity of the α-subunit induced by the clotting enzyme.The active site-masked clotting enzyme and factor B̄, treated with the peptidyl chloromethyl ketone, still functioned for activation (Fig.2 D). These results suggest that the α-subunit forms a complex with the clotting enzyme or factor B̄ to induce a conformational change of the α-subunit and concomitantly induce phenol oxidase activity. The reaction stoichiometry also suggests that the Tachypleus prophenol oxidase-activating system is equipped with a self-regulating mechanism to localize phenol oxidase activity at the site of injury and to prevent unnecessary diffusion of this activity through a proteolytic activation. Interestingly, the zymogen of the clotting enzyme (proclotting enzyme) also induced the phenol oxidase activity, and the stoichiometric interaction of the extrapolated line occurred at an [α-subunit]/[proclotting enzyme] ratio of about 1.0 (Fig. 2 C).A common structural feature of the clotting enzyme and factor B̄is the presence of an amino-terminal disulfide-knotted domain (termed the clip domain) consisting of three disulfide bridges (9Muta T.

Therefore, the clip domains of the clotting enzyme and factorB̄ may mediate the interaction of these proteases with hemocyanin to turn on the switch for functional conversion.Like other arthropod phenol oxidases, the functionally transformed α-subunit showed an o-diphenol oxidase activity. 4-Methylcatechol and catechol were readily oxidized, but tyrosine (monophenol) and hydroquinone (p-diphenol) were not significantly oxidized (Fig.3 A). Arthropod prophenol oxidases are known to be non-enzymatically activated by treatment with detergents, lipids, or organic solvents (30Ashida M. Yamazaki H. Ohnishi E. Ishizaki H. Molting and Metamorphosis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 239-265Google Scholar). Hemocyanins from the crabCarcinus maenas and the lobster Homarus americanus express significant phenol oxidase activity in the presence of perchlorate (31Zlateva T. Muro P.D. Salvato B. Beltramini M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Expectedly, SDS and phosphatidylethanolamine also induced the phenol oxidase activity of the α-subunit, and the specific activity of the SDS-activated α-subunit for 4-methylatechol was 35 ± 1 nmol/min/mg, approximately equal to that activated by the clotting enzyme (Fig.3 B). The substrate specificity of the SDS-activated α-subunit was also quite similar to that obtained with the α-subunit activated by the clotting enzyme (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Substrate specificity of the hemocyanin α-subunit.

Phenol oxidases in insects and crustaceans participate in wound healing and repair of the damaged exoskeleton, as well as hardening of the exoskeleton during molting (32Terwilliger N.B. Am. Zool. 1999; 39: 589-599Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although Tachypleus hemocyanin functions as an oxygen carrier under normal conditions, it may be converted to phenol oxidase at the site of injury to prevent microbial invasion and to promote wound repair. The Tachypleus coagulation cascade appears to be a very rational and sophisticated system by which the host defense can simultaneously trigger both blood coagulation and prophenol oxidase activation. In insects and crustaceans, an ancestral protease cascade corresponding to the bifunctional cascade found in horseshoe crabs may have evolved into an exclusive system of prophenol oxidase activation.Figure 4A link between the horseshoe crab clotting and prophenol oxidase-activating cascades, and a comparison between this linkage and those of the insect and crustacean prophenol oxidase-activating cascades.

Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). Two such systems, the blood (hemolymph) coagulation system in the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus and the prophenol oxidase-activating system in insects and crustaceans, are sensitive nonself-recognizing cascades triggered by microbial cell wall constituents (2Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 3Ratcliffe N.A. Leonard C. Rowley A.F.

In invertebrates, two kinds of protease cascades have been well characterized at the molecular level, the Tachypleus coagulation cascade (2Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and the morphogenetic cascade for determining embryonic dorsal-ventral polarity in the fly Drosophila melanogaster (5Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The structural similarity of their target proteins, a Tachypleus clottable protein coagulogen and a Drosophila Toll ligand Spätzle, as well as the sequence homology between the serine proteases of the two cascades, suggests that these two functionally different cascades may have a common origin (6Bergner A. Oganessyan V. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Typke D. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6789-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Smith C.L. DeLotto R.

The microbial polysaccharide-mediated coagulation cascade in Tachypleusinvolves four-serine protease zymogens (2Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Factor C is a biosensor against lipopolysaccharides and is autocatalytically activated to factor C̄, which then activates factor B and, in turn, factorB̄ converts the proclotting enzyme to the clotting enzyme. Another biosensor, factor G, is activated in the presence of β-1,3-glucans to factor Ḡ, which directly activates the proclotting enzyme. In insects and crustaceans, the prophenol oxidase activation system is an important part of the host defense, where it functions to detect and kill invading pathogens, as well as to synthesize melanin for wound healing and encapsulation of pathogens (3Ratcliffe N.A. Leonard C. Rowley A.F. Science. 1984; 226: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 4Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of the prophenol oxidase activation remains poorly understood. Prophenol oxidase-activating enzymes recently cloned from insects have been shown to be homologous to Tachypleusclotting enzyme, factor B̄, or Drosophila Easter (9Muta T. Hashimoto R. Miyata T. Nishimura H. Toh Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22426-22433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Muta T. Oda T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

In the American horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemusthe induction of prophenol oxidase activity in the blood is evident by treatment with either detergents or lipids (14Nellaiappan K. Sugumaran M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 133B: 163-168Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but prophenol oxidase(s) from horseshoe crabs has not been identified at the molecular level. Here we show that the Tachypleuscoagulation cascade is linked to prophenol oxidase activation, and we propose that the two host defense systems of blood coagulation and prophenol oxidase activation have evolved from a common ancestral protease cascade. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTachypleus coagulation factors were tested to determine whether they could produce phenol oxidase activity in plasma free from hemocytes, using 4-methylcatechol as substrate (Fig.1 A). The clotting enzyme and factor B̄ efficiently produced phenol oxidase activity. However, factor C̄ and factor Ḡ, as well as trypsin, could not significantly produce phenol oxidase activity, indicating that the specific proteases are required for the production of phenol oxidase activity in Tachypleus plasma.The phenol oxidase activity in plasma disappeared with the removal of hemocyanin by ultracentrifugation, suggesting thatTachypleus hemocyanin is originally involved in the prophenol oxidase-activating system. Prophenol oxidases and hemocyanins display significant sequence similarity, and both contain two functional copper-binding sites capable of reversibly binding an oxygen molecule (21Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar). Tachypleus hemocyanin is composed of at least six subunits having the same molecular mass of 70 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but that are separable by an anion-exchanger column chromatography (15Takagi T. Nemoto T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1980; 87: 1785-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All the fractions, each containing different subunit(s), expressed phenol oxidase activity (Fig. 1 B). Fraction I containing the α-subunit was used for the subsequent experiments, since its primary sequence is already known (24Linzen B. Soeter N.M. Riggs A.F. Schneider H.-J. Schartau W. Moor M.D. Yokota E. Behrens P.Q. Nakashima H. Takagi T. Nemoto T. Vereijken J.M. Bak H.J. Beintema J.J. Volbeda A. Gaykema W.P.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1985; 229: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).Under the physiological conditions arthropod prophenol oxidases require a proteolytic cleavage for activation by a specific protease; the freshwater crayfish prophenol oxidase with a molecular mass of 76 kDa is converted into an active form with 62 kDa by the prophenol oxidase-activating enzyme (25Aspan A. Huang T.S. Cerenuis L. Söderhäll K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The tarantula Eurypelma californicum hemocyanin was recently found to express phenol oxidase activity after limited proteolysis with trypsin or chymotrypsin (26Decker H. Rimke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25889-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, the α-subunit treated with the clotting enzyme maintained the native molecular mass of 70 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis during incubation for 1 h (Fig.2 A), despite the fact that the aliquots showed significant phenol oxidase activity (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, amino-terminal sequence analysis of the α-subunit after the 1-h incubation showed that the first 10 residues (Thr-Ile-Lys-Glu-Lys-Gln-Ala-Ser-Ile-Leu-) were consistent with those of the native protein (24Linzen B. Soeter N.M. Riggs A.F. Schneider H.-J. Schartau W. Moor M.D. Yokota E. Behrens P.Q. Nakashima H. Takagi T. Nemoto T. Vereijken J.M. Bak H.J. Beintema J.J. Volbeda A. Gaykema W.P.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1985; 229: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), indicating that proteolytic cleavage was not required for the functional conversion of hemocyanin to phenol oxidase.The stoichiometry of the non-proteolytic conversion was estimated by increasing the amounts of the clotting enzyme under a constant concentration of the α-subunit. The clotting enzyme transformed the α-subunit in a dose-dependent manner, and the resulting phenol oxidase activity reached a plateau at 1:1 molar ratio (Fig.2 C). The specific activity was 37 ± 8 nmol/min/mg, equivalent to that of the insect Holotrichia diomphaliaphenol oxidase, 47 nmol/min/mg, calculated from the published data (27Kwon T.H. Lee S.Y. Lee J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 7: 90-97Google Scholar). Typical inhibitors for arthropod phenol oxidases, such as phenylthiourea (12.5 mm) and EDTA (25 mm), completely inhibited the activity of the α-subunit induced by the clotting enzyme.The active site-masked clotting enzyme and factor B̄, treated with the peptidyl chloromethyl ketone, still functioned for activation (Fig.2 D). These results suggest that the α-subunit forms a complex with the clotting enzyme or factor B̄ to induce a conformational change of the α-subunit and concomitantly induce phenol oxidase activity. The reaction stoichiometry also suggests that the Tachypleus prophenol oxidase-activating system is equipped with a self-regulating mechanism to localize phenol oxidase activity at the site of injury and to prevent unnecessary diffusion of this activity through a proteolytic activation.

Therefore, the clip domains of the clotting enzyme and factorB̄ may mediate the interaction of these proteases with hemocyanin to turn on the switch for functional conversion. Like other arthropod phenol oxidases, the functionally transformed α-subunit showed an o-diphenol oxidase activity. 4-Methylcatechol and catechol were readily oxidized, but tyrosine (monophenol) and hydroquinone (p-diphenol) were not significantly oxidized (Fig.3 A). Arthropod prophenol oxidases are known to be non-enzymatically activated by treatment with detergents, lipids, or organic solvents (30Ashida M. Yamazaki H. Ohnishi E. Ishizaki H. Molting and Metamorphosis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 239-265Google Scholar). Hemocyanins from the crabCarcinus maenas and the lobster Homarus americanus express significant phenol oxidase activity in the presence of perchlorate (31Zlateva T. Muro P.D. Salvato B. Beltramini M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Expectedly, SDS and phosphatidylethanolamine also induced the phenol oxidase activity of the α-subunit, and the specific activity of the SDS-activated α-subunit for 4-methylatechol was 35 ± 1 nmol/min/mg, approximately equal to that activated by the clotting enzyme (Fig.3 B). The substrate specificity of the SDS-activated α-subunit was also quite similar to that obtained with the α-subunit activated by the clotting enzyme (Fig. 3 C). We clearly showed here that the Tachypleus coagulation cascade is linked to prophenol oxidase activation through the non-enzymatic interaction of the specific coagulation factors with hemocyanin, which leads to the functional conversion of hemocyanin to phenol oxidase (Fig. 4). Phenol oxidases in insects and crustaceans participate in wound healing and repair of the damaged exoskeleton, as well as hardening of the exoskeleton during molting (32Terwilliger N.B. Am. Zool. 1999; 39: 589-599Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although Tachypleus hemocyanin functions as an oxygen carrier under normal conditions, it may be converted to phenol oxidase at the site of injury to prevent microbial invasion and to promote wound repair. The Tachypleus coagulation cascade appears to be a very rational and sophisticated system by which the host defense can simultaneously trigger both blood coagulation and prophenol oxidase activation. In insects and crustaceans, an ancestral protease cascade corresponding to the bifunctional cascade found in horseshoe crabs may have evolved into an exclusive system of prophenol oxidase activation.

The genes coding for the BfiI restriction-modification (R-M) system were cloned/sequenced and biochemical characterization of BfiI restriction enzyme was performed. The BfiI R-M system contained three proteins: two N4-methylcytosine methyltransferases and a restriction enzyme.

The N-terminal part of the BfiI restriction enzyme amino acid sequence revealed intriguing similarities to an EDTA-resistant nuclease of Salmonella typhimurium. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that BfiI, like the nuclease of S. typhimurium, cleaves DNA in the absence of Mg2+ ions and hydrolyzes an artificial substrate bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate.

We propose that the DNA-binding specificity of BfiI stems from the C-terminal part of the protein.

Kim S.C. Hasan N. Podhajska A.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 100: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Currently, our knowledge of the structure and mechanisms of catalysis used by type IIs restriction enzymes is limited to the FokI restriction enzyme that recognizes asymmetric nucleotide sequence 5′-GGATG and cleaves both DNA strands 9/13 nucleotides away from the recognition sequence (2Sugisaki H. Kanazawa S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1981; 16: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). According to proteolytic cleavage and deletion analysis data (3Li L. Wu L.P. Chandrasegaran S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4Li L. Wu L.P. Clarke R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 133: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), further confirmed by structural studies (5Wah D.A. Hirsch J.A. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), FokI contains two functional domains, one responsible for DNA recognition (N-terminal domain) and the other for cleavage (C-terminal domain). Interestingly, the structural architecture of theFokI cleavage domain displays a striking similarity to the monomer of BamHI (6Newman M. Strzelecka T. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1994; 368: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), demonstrating that both enzymes share similar catalytic machinery despite the fact that they interact with nucleic acids differently. Protein sequence comparisons suggest that the StsI restriction enzyme, which recognizes the same nucleotide sequence as FokI but cleaves DNA 10/14 nucleotides away, possesses a similar modular organization (7Kita K. Kotani H. Ohta H. Yanase H. Kato N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 618Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 8Kita K. Suisha M. Kotani H. Yanase H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4167-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, we still lack evidence to indicate if other type IIs restriction enzymes share a similar structural architecture.The BfiI, isolated from Bacillus firmus S8120 strain, is a member of the type IIs restriction enzymes. The enzyme recognizes non-palindromic nucleotide sequence 5′-ACTGGG and cleaves complementary DNA strands 5 and 4 nucleotides beyond the recognition sequence (9Vitkute J. Maneliene Z. Petrusyte M. Janulaitis A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3348-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In order to gain an insight into the structural organization and mechanisms of DNA recognition and catalysis employed by the type IIs restriction enzymes, we focused on the structural, biochemical, and mechanistical characterization of the BfiI restriction enzyme. Here we report the cloning and sequence analysis ofBfiI R-M1 system and a biochemical characterization of the BfiI restriction endonuclease. We suggest that BfiI uses a novel catalytic domain to perform DNA cleavage that radically differs from the one employed by the archetypal FokI endonuclease and other type II restriction enzymes.DISCUSSIONThe restriction-modification system of the Bacillus firmus S8120 strain comprises two methyltransferases and a single restriction enzyme and is a typical type IIs system. Each methylase recognizes and methylates bases on the opposite strands of the recognition sequence making the modified DNA resistant to the restriction enzyme cleavage. Mg2+ ions are a necessary cofactor for DNA hydrolysis by type II and type IIs restriction enzymes (25Roberts R.J. Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments strikingly revealed that Mg2+ions are not required for the DNA cleavage by BfiI, raising the question of how catalysis is achieved.Based mostly on the structural and biochemical studies ofFokI endonuclease, the type IIs restriction enzymes are thought to comprise two modules connected by a flexible linker (3Li L. Wu L.P. Chandrasegaran S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4Li L. Wu L.P. Clarke R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 133: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Wah D.A. Hirsch J.A. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In the case of FokI, the N-terminal subdomain is responsible for the DNA binding and the C-terminal for the cleavage. Structural comparisons revealed that the cleavage domain of FokI is structurally very similar to the monomer of dimeric type II restriction enzyme BamHI, suggesting a similar mechanism of catalysis (5Wah D.A. Hirsch J.A. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the FokI restriction enzyme evolved through the fusion of the catalytic machinery of the type II restriction enzyme to the separate DNA-binding domain, and developed a sophisticated mechanism to couple catalysis to sequence recognition.Strikingly, protein sequence analysis of BfiI restriction enzyme revealed (Fig. 2) that the N-terminal part of the protein exhibits weak similarities to an EDTA-resistant nuclease Nuc ofS. typhimurium (26Pohlman R.F. Liu F. Wang L. More M.I. Winans S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4867-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Nuc nuclease, encoded by the gene located on the pKM101 plasmid of S. typhimurium, randomly cuts single-stranded and double-stranded DNA in the absence of metal ions (26Pohlman R.F. Liu F. Wang L. More M.I. Winans S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4867-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Winans S.C. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of the protein sequence of Nuc unexpectedly revealed identities with proteins belonging to the phospholipase D superfamily (28Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 242-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Ponting C.P. Kerr I.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Subsequent biochemical studies of Nuc demonstrated that the enzyme catalyzes cleavage of the phosphodiester bonds via a two step mechanism involving covalent phosphohistidine intermediate of His-94 (30Gottlin E.B. Rudolph A.E. Zhao Y. Matthews H.R. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9202-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of Nuc nuclease has been solved to 2.0-Å resolution, providing us with details of the active site organization (31Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues His-94, Lys-96, Ser-109, Asn-111, and Glu-122 were found in close of WO42− ion bound at the presumptive active site of Nuc. The position of the His-94 residue at the active site of Nuc is consistent with its predicted key role in catalysis.Sequence alignment between Nuc and BfiI indicates (Fig. 2) that all residues found at the active site of Nuc (including active site His) are conserved in BfiI restriction enzyme suggesting a similar organization of the active sites. It is interesting to note that secondary structure predictions for the N-terminal domain of BfiI were very similar to the secondary structure elements of Nuc, suggesting fold similarities (Fig. 2). Thus, it was tempting to suggest that N-terminal domain of BfiI is similar to Nuc. The similarities presented in Fig. 2, however, are below the statistically significant level and should be treated with caution. Therefore, we sought other evidence in support of the hypothesis that BfiI possess a Nuc-like catalytic domain.Unlike most nucleases, Nuc nuclease cleaves DNA in the absence of metal ions (23Zhao Y. Stuckey J.A. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2655-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Pohlman R.F. Liu F. Wang L. More M.I. Winans S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4867-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Winans S.C. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes studied to date absolutely require Mg2+ ions for phosphodiester bond cleavage. Preliminary observations using phage λ DNA and quantitative studies of pUC19 cleavage by BfiI (Fig. 3) indicate that metal ions are unnecessary for the phosphodiester bond cleavage by BfiI and suggest mechanistic similarity to Nuc nuclease. The single turnover experiments with pUC19 and BfiI yielded the first-order rate constant of 0.052 s−1 that presumably corresponds to the rate of the chemical step (phosphodiester bond cleavage) and is independent of the metal ion. The value of the rate constant is more than 10-fold lower than values of the rate constants of the chemical step reported for the Mg2+-dependent restriction enzymesEcoRI (32Wright D.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31896-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), EcoRV (33Vermote C.L.M. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6082-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and MunI (19Sasnauskas G. Jeltsch A. Pingoud A. Siksnys V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The experiments with pUC19 cleavage under multiple turnover conditions (Fig. 3) revealed, however, that a step other than the chemical step, limits the overall reaction rate of pUC19 cleavage by BfiI. Indeed, the k cat for the cleavage of the closed supercoiled pUC19 form by BfiI in the absence of the metal ion was approximately 400-fold lower than the rate constant of the chemical step. It is possible that, under multiple turnover conditions, dissociation of the enzyme-product complex limits the overall reaction rate. Interestingly, metal ions (Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+) at 5–10 mm concentrations increased thek cat value approximately 10-fold. A similar effect has been reported for vaccinia virus topoisomerase (34Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This enzyme did not require metal ions for the DNA cleavage; however, it exhibits metal dependence of product release rate.Moreover, like the Nuc enzyme, BfiI exhibited the ability to hydrolyze the artificial substrate bis-pNPP and metal ions were not required for catalysis. Control experiments revealed that typical type II restriction enzymes like MunI and Cfr10I or type IIs enzyme FokI did not catalyze hydrolysis of bis-pNPP either in the presence or absence of Mg ions. The reaction rate of the bis-pNPP cleavage by BfiI was much slower than the rate of DNA cleavage. The second order reaction rate constant (k cat/K m) for the bis-pNPP cleavage by BfiI was equal to the 4.2 ± 0.1m−1 s−1(pH 6.0, 25 °C). Noteworthy, the value (4.2m−1 s−1) of the second order rate constant for bis-pNPP cleavage byBfiI was close to thek cat/K m value (10m−1 s−1, 30 °C) reported for Nuc cleavage of bis-pNPP (23Zhao Y. Stuckey J.A. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2655-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).The highest rate of bis-pNPP hydrolysis both by the BfiI restriction enzyme and the Nuc nuclease was observed at pH 5.5–6.0. The alkaline limb of pH dependence of bis-pNPP hydrolysis byBfiI is consistent with the ionization of a base with an apparent pK a value of 6.4. This value is close to the pK a value of His residue and supports the assumption that such a residue is located at the active site ofBfiI. The pH dependence of bis-pNPP hydrolysis by Nuc has not been reported; however, the coincidence of the optimal pH values for bis-pNPP hydrolysis by BfiI and Nuc suggests similar pH dependence for artificial substrate hydrolysis by Nuc. In contrast to the artificial substrate, BfiI cleaved plasmid DNA both at pH 6.0 (data not shown) and pH 8.0 (Fig. 3 B). The ability to hydrolyze DNA at pH 7.5 has also been reported for the Nuc nuclease. The differences in the pH dependence values for hydrolysis of small artificial substrates and DNA by BfiI might be attributed to the perturbation of the pK a values of active site residues in the enzyme-DNA complex. If we assume that both protonated and unprotonated BfiI forms are able to bind bis-pNPP, the pK a value, determined from the pH dependence of thek cat/K m ratio corresponds to the ionization of catalytically important residue at the active site of the free enzyme (24Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999Google Scholar). The pK a value of the same residue in the enzyme-DNA complex may be shifted significantly. Indeed, such effects were reported for the barnase-catalyzed hydrolysis of RNA and dinucleotides (35Gordon-Beresford R.M. Van Belle D. Giraldo J. Wodak S.J. Proteins. 1996; 25: 180-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The optimum pH for RNA hydrolysis of barnase was 8.5 and exceeded that GpA transesterification by 3.5 units. Alternatively, the decrease of thek cat/K m ratio with the increase of pH in the case of bis-pNPP hydrolysis by BfiI might be explained by decreased binding (increasedK m) of the low molecular weight substrate while DNA binding might be less sensitive to the pH change.Collectively, our data indicate that BfiI exhibits most of the enzymatic properties characteristic for the Nuc nuclease. However, unlike the nonspecific Nuc nuclease, BfiI restriction enzyme cleaves phosphodiester bonds in DNA site-specifically (Fig. 3,B–D). Both the specific DNA cleavage and bis-pNPP hydrolysis proceeds at the same active site of BfiI. Oligonucleotide containing the recognition sequence of BfiI effectively inhibited hydrolysis of bis-pNPP (Fig. 6) at pH 7.0. In contrast, a nonspecific oligonucleotide lacking the recognition sequence of BfiI had only a marginal effect on the rate of bis-pNPP hydrolysis. These experiments indicate that, unlike Nuc,BfiI effectively discriminates between specific and nonspecific DNA. Since sequence comparisons reveal similarities of N-terminal part of BfiI protein to the Nuc nuclease, we propose that DNA-binding specificity of BfiI stems from the C-terminal part of the protein. It is possible that, as inFokI (5Wah D.A. Hirsch J.A. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), the nucleolytic domain of BfiI is sequestered by the DNA-binding domain. Only upon BfiI binding to its recognition sequence does the cleavage domain swing over to the DNA cleavage site and the enzyme become activated. The possible cross-talking interactions between the DNA binding and cleavage domains of BfiI obviously require further studies.CONCLUSIONSThe experimental evidence presented here indicates that, in contrast to other restriction enzymes that require metal ions for catalysis, BfiI cleaves DNA specifically in the absence of metal ions. We suggest that, like to other type IIs enzymes,BfiI is composed of two subdomains that perform separate cleavage and DNA-recognition functions. The catalytic N-terminal subdomain of BfiI is presumably similar to that of nonspecific nuclease Nuc that cleaves DNA in the absence of metal ions. The C-terminal part of the BfiI presumably performs the DNA-binding function. It is tempting to speculate that BfiI evolved by fusion of the catalytic Nuc-like domain to the DNA-binding domain. The archetypal type IIs restriction enzyme FokI, in contrast to BfiI requires Mg2+ ions for DNA cleavage, its cleavage domain is located at the C-terminal part of the protein and is similar to the monomer of BamHI. Therefore, we suggest that BfiI represents a novel subclass of type IIs restriction enzymes that differ from the archetypal FokI by the fold of the cleavage domain and by the location of the active site and reaction mechanism. Thus, type IIs restriction enzymes probably form a structurally and mechanistically diverse class. The existence of several different evolutionary lineages of type II restriction enzymes is probable. It will be interesting to see if the Nuc-like fold has been adopted by other restriction enzymes. Type IIs restriction enzymes recognize short non-palindromic DNA sequences and, in the presence of Mg2+ ions, cleave both DNA strands a short distance outside the recognition sequence (1Szybalski W. Kim S.C. Hasan N. Podhajska A.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 100: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Currently, our knowledge of the structure and mechanisms of catalysis used by type IIs restriction enzymes is limited to the FokI restriction enzyme that recognizes asymmetric nucleotide sequence 5′-GGATG and cleaves both DNA strands 9/13 nucleotides away from the recognition sequence (2Sugisaki H.

However, we still lack evidence to indicate if other type IIs restriction enzymes share a similar structural architecture. The BfiI, isolated from Bacillus firmus S8120 strain, is a member of the type IIs restriction enzymes. The enzyme recognizes non-palindromic nucleotide sequence 5′-ACTGGG and cleaves complementary DNA strands 5 and 4 nucleotides beyond the recognition sequence (9Vitkute J. Maneliene Z. Petrusyte M.

We suggest that BfiI uses a novel catalytic domain to perform DNA cleavage that radically differs from the one employed by the archetypal FokI endonuclease and other type II restriction enzymes. DISCUSSIONThe restriction-modification system of the Bacillus firmus S8120 strain comprises two methyltransferases and a single restriction enzyme and is a typical type IIs system. Each methylase recognizes and methylates bases on the opposite strands of the recognition sequence making the modified DNA resistant to the restriction enzyme cleavage. Mg2+ ions are a necessary cofactor for DNA hydrolysis by type II and type IIs restriction enzymes (25Roberts R.J. Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases.

Subsequent biochemical studies of Nuc demonstrated that the enzyme catalyzes cleavage of the phosphodiester bonds via a two step mechanism involving covalent phosphohistidine intermediate of His-94 (30Gottlin E.B. Rudolph A.E. Zhao Y. Matthews H.R. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9202-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of Nuc nuclease has been solved to 2.0-Å resolution, providing us with details of the active site organization (31Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues His-94, Lys-96, Ser-109, Asn-111, and Glu-122 were found in close of WO42− ion bound at the presumptive active site of Nuc. The position of the His-94 residue at the active site of Nuc is consistent with its predicted key role in catalysis.Sequence alignment between Nuc and BfiI indicates (Fig. 2) that all residues found at the active site of Nuc (including active site His) are conserved in BfiI restriction enzyme suggesting a similar organization of the active sites. It is interesting to note that secondary structure predictions for the N-terminal domain of BfiI were very similar to the secondary structure elements of Nuc, suggesting fold similarities (Fig. 2). Thus, it was tempting to suggest that N-terminal domain of BfiI is similar to Nuc. The similarities presented in Fig. 2, however, are below the statistically significant level and should be treated with caution. Therefore, we sought other evidence in support of the hypothesis that BfiI possess a Nuc-like catalytic domain.Unlike most nucleases, Nuc nuclease cleaves DNA in the absence of metal ions (23Zhao Y. Stuckey J.A. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2655-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Pohlman R.F. Liu F. Wang L. More M.I. Winans S.C.

Restriction enzymes studied to date absolutely require Mg2+ ions for phosphodiester bond cleavage. Preliminary observations using phage λ DNA and quantitative studies of pUC19 cleavage by BfiI (Fig. 3) indicate that metal ions are unnecessary for the phosphodiester bond cleavage by BfiI and suggest mechanistic similarity to Nuc nuclease. The single turnover experiments with pUC19 and BfiI yielded the first-order rate constant of 0.052 s−1 that presumably corresponds to the rate of the chemical step (phosphodiester bond cleavage) and is independent of the metal ion. The value of the rate constant is more than 10-fold lower than values of the rate constants of the chemical step reported for the Mg2+-dependent restriction enzymesEcoRI (32Wright D.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31896-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), EcoRV (33Vermote C.L.M. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6082-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and MunI (19Sasnauskas G. Jeltsch A. Pingoud A. Siksnys V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The experiments with pUC19 cleavage under multiple turnover conditions (Fig. 3) revealed, however, that a step other than the chemical step, limits the overall reaction rate of pUC19 cleavage by BfiI. Indeed, the k cat for the cleavage of the closed supercoiled pUC19 form by BfiI in the absence of the metal ion was approximately 400-fold lower than the rate constant of the chemical step. It is possible that, under multiple turnover conditions, dissociation of the enzyme-product complex limits the overall reaction rate. Interestingly, metal ions (Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+) at 5–10 mm concentrations increased thek cat value approximately 10-fold. A similar effect has been reported for vaccinia virus topoisomerase (34Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This enzyme did not require metal ions for the DNA cleavage; however, it exhibits metal dependence of product release rate.Moreover, like the Nuc enzyme, BfiI exhibited the ability to hydrolyze the artificial substrate bis-pNPP and metal ions were not required for catalysis. Control experiments revealed that typical type II restriction enzymes like MunI and Cfr10I or type IIs enzyme FokI did not catalyze hydrolysis of bis-pNPP either in the presence or absence of Mg ions. The reaction rate of the bis-pNPP cleavage by BfiI was much slower than the rate of DNA cleavage. The second order reaction rate constant (k cat/K m) for the bis-pNPP cleavage by BfiI was equal to the 4.2 ± 0.1m−1 s−1(pH 6.0, 25 °C). Noteworthy, the value (4.2m−1 s−1) of the second order rate constant for bis-pNPP cleavage byBfiI was close to thek cat/K m value (10m−1 s−1, 30 °C) reported for Nuc cleavage of bis-pNPP (23Zhao Y. Stuckey J.A. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2655-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).The highest rate of bis-pNPP hydrolysis both by the BfiI restriction enzyme and the Nuc nuclease was observed at pH 5.5–6.0. The alkaline limb of pH dependence of bis-pNPP hydrolysis byBfiI is consistent with the ionization of a base with an apparent pK a value of 6.4. This value is close to the pK a value of His residue and supports the assumption that such a residue is located at the active site ofBfiI. The pH dependence of bis-pNPP hydrolysis by Nuc has not been reported; however, the coincidence of the optimal pH values for bis-pNPP hydrolysis by BfiI and Nuc suggests similar pH dependence for artificial substrate hydrolysis by Nuc. In contrast to the artificial substrate, BfiI cleaved plasmid DNA both at pH 6.0 (data not shown) and pH 8.0 (Fig. 3 B). The ability to hydrolyze DNA at pH 7.5 has also been reported for the Nuc nuclease. The differences in the pH dependence values for hydrolysis of small artificial substrates and DNA by BfiI might be attributed to the perturbation of the pK a values of active site residues in the enzyme-DNA complex. If we assume that both protonated and unprotonated BfiI forms are able to bind bis-pNPP, the pK a value, determined from the pH dependence of thek cat/K m ratio corresponds to the ionization of catalytically important residue at the active site of the free enzyme (24Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999Google Scholar). The pK a value of the same residue in the enzyme-DNA complex may be shifted significantly. Indeed, such effects were reported for the barnase-catalyzed hydrolysis of RNA and dinucleotides (35Gordon-Beresford R.M. Van Belle D. Giraldo J. Wodak S.J. Proteins. 1996; 25: 180-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The optimum pH for RNA hydrolysis of barnase was 8.5 and exceeded that GpA transesterification by 3.5 units. Alternatively, the decrease of thek cat/K m ratio with the increase of pH in the case of bis-pNPP hydrolysis by BfiI might be explained by decreased binding (increasedK m) of the low molecular weight substrate while DNA binding might be less sensitive to the pH change.Collectively, our data indicate that BfiI exhibits most of the enzymatic properties characteristic for the Nuc nuclease. However, unlike the nonspecific Nuc nuclease, BfiI restriction enzyme cleaves phosphodiester bonds in DNA site-specifically (Fig. 3,B–D). Both the specific DNA cleavage and bis-pNPP hydrolysis proceeds at the same active site of BfiI. Oligonucleotide containing the recognition sequence of BfiI effectively inhibited hydrolysis of bis-pNPP (Fig. 6) at pH 7.0. In contrast, a nonspecific oligonucleotide lacking the recognition sequence of BfiI had only a marginal effect on the rate of bis-pNPP hydrolysis. These experiments indicate that, unlike Nuc,BfiI effectively discriminates between specific and nonspecific DNA. Since sequence comparisons reveal similarities of N-terminal part of BfiI protein to the Nuc nuclease, we propose that DNA-binding specificity of BfiI stems from the C-terminal part of the protein. It is possible that, as inFokI (5Wah D.A. Hirsch J.A. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), the nucleolytic domain of BfiI is sequestered by the DNA-binding domain. Only upon BfiI binding to its recognition sequence does the cleavage domain swing over to the DNA cleavage site and the enzyme become activated. The possible cross-talking interactions between the DNA binding and cleavage domains of BfiI obviously require further studies. The restriction-modification system of the Bacillus firmus S8120 strain comprises two methyltransferases and a single restriction enzyme and is a typical type IIs system. Each methylase recognizes and methylates bases on the opposite strands of the recognition sequence making the modified DNA resistant to the restriction enzyme cleavage. Mg2+ ions are a necessary cofactor for DNA hydrolysis by type II and type IIs restriction enzymes (25Roberts R.J. Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments strikingly revealed that Mg2+ions are not required for the DNA cleavage by BfiI, raising the question of how catalysis is achieved. Based mostly on the structural and biochemical studies ofFokI endonuclease, the type IIs restriction enzymes are thought to comprise two modules connected by a flexible linker (3Li L. Wu L.P. Chandrasegaran S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4Li L. Wu L.P. Clarke R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 133: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Wah D.A. Hirsch J.A. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In the case of FokI, the N-terminal subdomain is responsible for the DNA binding and the C-terminal for the cleavage. Structural comparisons revealed that the cleavage domain of FokI is structurally very similar to the monomer of dimeric type II restriction enzyme BamHI, suggesting a similar mechanism of catalysis (5Wah D.A. Hirsch J.A. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1997; 388: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the FokI restriction enzyme evolved through the fusion of the catalytic machinery of the type II restriction enzyme to the separate DNA-binding domain, and developed a sophisticated mechanism to couple catalysis to sequence recognition. Strikingly, protein sequence analysis of BfiI restriction enzyme revealed (Fig. 2) that the N-terminal part of the protein exhibits weak similarities to an EDTA-resistant nuclease Nuc ofS. typhimurium (26Pohlman R.F. Liu F. Wang L. More M.I. Winans S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4867-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Nuc nuclease, encoded by the gene located on the pKM101 plasmid of S. typhimurium, randomly cuts single-stranded and double-stranded DNA in the absence of metal ions (26Pohlman R.F. Liu F. Wang L. More M.I. Winans S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4867-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Winans S.C. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of the protein sequence of Nuc unexpectedly revealed identities with proteins belonging to the phospholipase D superfamily (28Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 242-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Ponting C.P. Kerr I.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar).

Conjugation to a specific residue conveys the advantage of a homogeneous structure. The site may be selected to be spatially removed from areas known to affect antigen-binding properties. For example, additions to the CH3 domain of the heavy chain may avoid compromising antigen-binding properties (variable region) and effector and complement functions (CH2 domain). Examples of site-directed conjugation procedures include conjugation to the carbohydrate portion of antibodies (14Rodwell J.D. Alvarez V.L. Lee C. Lopes A.D. Goers J.W.F. King J.H.D. Posner H.J.

Conjugation to intrinsic cysteines requires reduction of S–S bonds that risks protein fragmentation (20Morrison R.T. Lyster D.M. Alcorn L. Rhodes B.A. Breslow K. Burchiel S.W. Int. J. Nucl. Med. Biol. 1984; 11: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Weber R.W. Boutin R.H. Nedelman M.A. Lister-James J. Dean R.T. Bioconjugate Chem. 1990; 1: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Antibodies naturally contain no free sulfhydryl groups and 16 or more highly conserved cysteine residues whose thiols form disulfide bridges. It is hypothetically attractive to engineer an antibody to possess a cysteine whose thiol is not oxidized. However, when applied at Cys-444 in CH3, dimerization and structural aberrations were common (22Shopes B. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2918-2922PubMed Google Scholar, 23Caron P.C. Laird W. Co M.S. Avdalovic N.M. Queen C. Scheinberg D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1191-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In another example, a Ser → Cys variant in CH1 of the heavy chain generated dimers and an interchain structural variant or “tethered” antibody (24Shopes B. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Where molecular modeling was employed in CH1, a free thiol was observed when the cysteine was introduced into a molecular pocket but not on the solvent-accessible surface (25Lyons A. King D.J. Owens R.J. Yarranton G.T. Millican A. Whittle N.R. Adair J.R. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Bodmer, M. W., Adair, J. R., Whittle, N. R., Lyons, A. H., and Owens, R. J. (June 15, 1993) U. S. Patent 5,219,996Google Scholar). Solvent-accessible cysteines were reversibly blocked. However, the authors were not able to generate reactive thiol without reduction of hinge disulfides, and these variants were not pursued further. We describe monoclonal antibodies that contain an engineered cysteine at position 442 in heavy chain CH3. Cells expressing the novel variants produced a majority of monomeric IgG and minimal aggregate forms. Monomeric IgG was readily purified by conventional means and was stable upon long term storage. We demonstrate that the engineered Cys-442 was reduced under controlled conditions and conjugated with a bifunctional chelator. We show that the antigen-binding properties were indistinguishable from the parent antibody. Finally, we show that the conjugation was in fact site-specific by peptide mapping of a radiolabeled conjugate. Metal-free plasticware (polypropylene) or plasticware that had been soaked in 3 mHCl overnight and rinsed thoroughly with Milli-Q (18 MΩ) water was used throughout this work to reduce metal contamination (27Thiers R.E. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1957; 5: 273-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All buffers and reagents were dissolved in Ultrex water (J. T. Baker Inc.). The reagents were of analytical grade or better. All prepared buffers were treated with Chelex-100 resin (Na+ form, 100–200 mesh, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturers instructions and passed through a 0.22 μm filter (Nalgene) prior to use. Bromoacetyl-TMT1 (28Toner, J. L. (August 22, 1989) Terpyridine Chelating Agents, U. S. Patent 4,859,777Google Scholar) was prepared in the Wellcome Research Laboratories according to literature protocols with minor modifications. Reverse-phase HPLC was performed on an LDC Analytical system (now Thermoquest) consisting of a model CM3100 pump and a model SM400 spectrometer. Lutetium-177 was obtained from University of Missouri Research Reactor using the protocol previously described (29Stimmel J.B. Kull Jr., F.C. Nucl. Med. Biol. 1998; 25: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Antibodies were humanized, and isotypes were generated by grafting the indicated specificities and constant regions. The G4 constant region that had been altered to limit Fc interaction (2Hutchins J.T. Kull Jr., F.C. Bynum J. Knick V.C. Thurmond L.M. Ray P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11980-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was further modified for site-directed conjugation. A Ser to Cys change was engineered at amino acid position 442 (EU/OU) in pUC18 (GW3811W94). Plasmid DNA was digested at the COOH-terminal NsiI and EcoRI sites releasing a 65-base pair fragment that was agarose (0.8%) gel-purified. Positive and negative strand oligonucleotides were synthesized (Oligos Etc.; Watsonville, OR) with the Ser to Cys change at 442 (EU/OU). The synthetic oligomers were annealed and ligated into the NsiI site (5′) and the EcoRI site (3′) of the construct. The Cys at position 442 (EU/OU) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. This G4 variant served as the scaffold to which various specificities were grafted. GW3811W94 is the humanized G4 variant of an anti-Ep-CAM monoclonal antibody (30Edwards D.P. Grzyb K.T. Dressler L.G. Mansel R.E. Zava D.T. Sledge Jr., G.W. McGuire W.L. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1306-1317PubMed Google Scholar, 31Litvinov S.V. Velders M.P. Bakker H.A.M. Fleuren G.J. Warnaar S.O. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). GW3811W94 conjugated with TMT was designated GW3811W94-TMT or GW1209W95. GW2838W94 is the G4 variant of Campath-1H (2Hutchins J.T. Kull Jr., F.C. Bynum J. Knick V.C. Thurmond L.M. Ray P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11980-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Native G4 Campath-1H served as a control. G4 variant anti-digoxin was also produced. The cDNA constructs were subcloned into mammalian expression vectors, transfected, and selected for stable expression in NSO mouse myeloma cell lines; the respective recombinant monoclonal antibody products were purified from conditioned cell culture supernatant as described previously (2Hutchins J.T. Kull Jr., F.C. Bynum J. Knick V.C. Thurmond L.M. Ray P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11980-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). If necessary, the protein was purified further by semi-prep gel filtration HPLC using a Diol 200 size exclusion column (YMC, Inc.). Purified protein was treated with 100 mm sodium DTPA prior to concentration by ultrafiltration (Amicon). For random conjugation and site-specific conjugation with Reduce-ImmTM reduction, the proteins were concentrated in 0.1 m TMAP, pH 8.2, 25 μm DTPA. For site-specific conjugation with MEA reduction, the proteins were concentrated into 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 5 mm DTPA. The final concentration of purified protein was typically between 400 and 600 μm. MEA (Pierce) was dissolved in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 5 mm DTPA at a concentration of 50 mm. MEA was added to the solution in a 10-fold excess over the protein concentration (300 μm). The reduction proceeded at room temperature for 60 min. Following reduction, the protein solution was passed through Bio-Spin 30 columns that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1 m TMAP, pH 8.2, 25 μm DTPA for 2 min at 150 × g. The protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm prior to conjugation. Antibody solutions (100 μm; degassed 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8) consisting of GW2838W94 and native G4 Campath-1H control were mixed with a fixed volume containing either buffer or increasing amounts of Reduce-ImmTM gel. (Reduce-ImmTM is a solid-phase reductant. The reductant capacity was assumed from the manufacturer to be 30 μmol/ml packed gel.) The mixture was shaken for 1 h at room temperature and centrifuged. The solution was subjected to free thiol determination by conventional means using Ellman's reagent. During the reduction, a 10 mm stock solution of the bifunctional chelator, bromoacetyl-TMT, was prepared in 0.1 m TMAP, pH 8.5, with no DTPA, and a small amount of this stock solution was trace-labeled with lutetium-177 for a minimum of 20 min at room temperature. Following reduction, two protein conjugation reactions were prepared as follows: a small scale analytical conjugation that used the trace-labeled chelator and a large scale conjugation that used unlabeled chelator. The small scale conjugation was used to monitor the extent of the conjugation reaction (32Meares C.P. McCall M.J. Reardan D.T. Goodwin D.A. Diamanti C.I. McTigue M. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In both conjugations the antibody (200 μm) was incubated with a 10-fold excess of bromoacetyl-TMT for 24 h at room temperature. The analytical reaction was evaluated by thin layer chromatography to monitor the extent of protein conjugation (see below). Unreacted reagents in the large scale conjugation were removed by centrifugation using Bio-Spin 30 columns that had been pre-equilibrated with 0.1 mammonium acetate, pH 6.5, for 2 min at 150 × g. The centrifugation was repeated until all small molecular weight materials were removed. This was typically accomplished after 2–3 centrifugations. GW1209W95 was evaluated for binding affinity and ability to accept metal (post-conjugation efficiency). The efficiency of the conjugation reaction was evaluated by thin layer chromatography on the analytical scale conjugation. Trace labeling of bromoacetyl-TMT was evaluated by adding an aliquot to 10 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. An aliquot (5 μl) of the small scale conjugation reaction was added to 10 μl 0.1 m ammonium citrate, pH 6.5. An aliquot (5 μl) of this solution was challenged for 5 min with 2 μl of 100 mm sodium DTPA, pH 6.5. An aliquot (5 μl) of each sample was spotted at the origin on a thin layer chromatography plate (Whatman 4865 821) and allowed to air-dry. The plate was eluted with 10% ammonium acetate:methanol (1:1). A radioanalytical image of the plate was obtained using an A-MK2 scanner (AMBIS, Inc.) Samples treated with phosphate resulted in free metal remaining at the origin and chelated metal migrating to the solvent front. In the case of the samples treated with citrate, chelated metal remained at the origin and free metal migrated to the solvent front. The protein concentration of the conjugates was determined prior to performing this assay (typically 150–200 μm) using a BCA assay (Pierce), because TMT absorbs at 280 nm. With the knowledge of the protein concentration and the number of chelators/antibody, the concentration of the chelator in solution can be calculated. This will be used to determine the final concentration of metal in the assay that was 2-fold greater than the chelator concentration. To a metal-free vial were added equivolumes of conjugate solution and metal solution that had been trace-labeled. The vial was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then 20 μl of 0.1 m ammonium citrate, pH 6.5, was added. An aliquot (5 μl) was challenged with 2 μl of 100 mm NaDTPA, pH 6.5. The vials were incubated for a minimum of 5 min. Five μl were spotted on instant thin layer chromatography SG plates and developed with 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.0. The percent radioactivity chelated by the conjugate was determined by radioanalytical imaging. The number of chelators that accept metal or efficiency can be calculated. 1209W95 was evaluated for quantitative binding to its antigen, Ep-CAM, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The protein concentration was determined by nephelometry (33Ackerman E. Rosevear J.W. Med. Progr. Technol. 1979; 6: 81-90PubMed Google Scholar). Ideal values should be 0.7–1.3 Klett units/mg indicating that the binding affinity of the antibody had not been affected (34Boyd P.N. Lines A.C. Patel A.K. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The principles of lutetium labeling have been recently described (29Stimmel J.B. Kull Jr., F.C. Nucl. Med. Biol. 1998; 25: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, non-radioactive lutetium-176 (1 mm) stock was prepared in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 6.7, and added to 1209W95 (24.13 mg/ml, 1 mg) to give a final concentration of 100 μm lutetium. The chelation reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 min at room temperature. Simultaneously, 1209W95 (400 μg) was trace-labeled with radioactive lutetium-177 using the same conditions. To remove unchelated lutetium, ammonium DTPA (50 mm) was added to the chelation solutions to give a final DTPA concentration of 1 mm, and each solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. During the chelation incubation, Bio-Spin 30 columns were pre-equilibrated with 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.6, 5 mm EDTA. Then, Lu-1209W95 was purified by passing each solution through a Bio-Spin 30 column for 2 min at 150 × g. The spin column purification was repeated to give a total of two spins. The protein concentration of Lu-1209W95 was determined by BCA analysis, and the purity of the labeled protein was determined by TLC analysis. Protein reduction and alkylation was accomplished using dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide (Aldrich) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 5 mm EDTA, 0.01% SDS. Dithiothreitol was added to Lu-1209W95 at a final concentration that was 50-fold greater than the thiol concentration of 1209W95 (16-SH/mol of protein). The reduction was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, exchanged into bicarbonate buffer containing 0.1% SDS, and concentrated using a Microcon ultrafiltration device. Aliquots of the radiolabeled and nonradioactive antibody were combined for digestion. Pooled antibody was digested with a 1:25 w/w ratio of either Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease (Glu-C, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or Achromobacter Lys-C (Wako) for 16 h at 37 °C. Following initial HPLC as described in the figure legends, radioactive fractions were mixed with 1/5 volume of 8m urea and 4/5 volume of 20 mm potassium phosphate prior to rechromatography. Our selection of potential mutation sites focused on the CH3 domain because the CH2 domain was glycosylated, and residues in this domain were involved in effector function. Consideration of residue types for substitution was limited to serines, which provided the most reasonable sites for mutation to cysteine on the basis of side chain similarity. Individual serine residues were evaluated for solvent accessibility and molecular environment using the three-dimensional structure of IgG1 (35Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) as a model of IgG4. Serine 442 was selected on the basis of solvent accessibility and its position in a stable portion of the immunoglobulin fold, as part of a β-pleated sheet. The subsequently determined structure of IgG4 (36Corper A.L. Sohi M.K. Bonagura V.R. Steinitz M. Jefferis R. Feinstein A. Beale D. Taussig M.J. Sutton B.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) was consistent with that analysis. The position of serine 442 in the IgG4 structure is illustrated in Fig. 1. When the novel Cys-442-containing constructs were expressed in NS0 mouse myeloma cells, only a small percentage of the antibody was in an aggregated form. Monomeric IgG was readily purified by conventional chromatography and was stable upon long term storage. The monomeric IgG was found to possess no free thiol (TablesI and II). The engineered thiols were blocked with cysteine and glutathione (not shown).Table IOptimal conditions for MEA reductionMEAFree –SH/mol protein1 h2 h3 h00.20.30.310 ×2.02.32.530 ×2.43.03.050 ×3.03.64.470 ×3.53.84.9100 ×4.34.35.1MEA (Pierce) was dissolved in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, and 5 mm DTPA at a concentration of 50 mm.

Free thiol content is expressed relative to moles of antibody. It is assumed that 2 mol of thiol were reduced per antibody thiol. The S.E. for triplicate measurements was ±0.1 SH/antibody. Open table in a new tab MEA (Pierce) was dissolved in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, and 5 mm DTPA at a concentration of 50 mm. MEA was added to the solution in excess over the protein concentration (300 μm) as indicated in the table. The reduction proceeded at room temperature for 60 min. Following reduction, the protein solution was passed through Bio-Spin 30 columns that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1 m TMAP, pH 8.2, 25 μmDTPA for 2 min at 150 × g.

Free thiol content is expressed relative to moles of antibody. It is assumed that 2 mol of thiol were reduced per antibody thiol. The S.E. for triplicate measurements was ±0.1 SH/antibody. Purified IgG did not contain free thiol. We found that the engineered thiols could be selectively reduced under controlled conditions with a mild reducing agent, MEA, or the solid-phase reductant, Reduce-ImmTM, without reducing natural disulfide bonds as indicated in Tables I and II. By using MEA to prepare chelator conjugates (Table I), selective reduction was achieved with a 10-fold excess of reagent over the protein concentration for 1 h at room temperature. The specific example shown in Table I employs a humanized anti-digoxin antibody that contains the same constant region as 1209W95. The results from this experiment are consistent with results from similar experiments performed on antibodies with different specificities and isotypes containing the engineered cysteine. A common pattern emerged from reductions under different conditions; the reduction reached a maximum value at 1 h and did not significantly increase over the course of the experiment. There was evidence that conditions that produced greater than 5.0 mol of SH/mol of antibody produced free heavy chain and free light chain together with a proportional decrease in the concentration of intact IgG (data not shown). Thus, we were confident that the conditions that produced 2.0 mol of SH/mol of antibody did not affect disulfide linkages. The same conditions utilized for the reduction with MEA on an analytical scale were used successfully to produce 1 g of protein conjugate. Table II summarizes the results obtained with solid-phase reductant and GW2838W94, a Cys-442 G4 variant of Campath-1H, and its native G4 control. Since the mutant thiols were blocked with cysteine or glutathione, 2 mol of free thiol per antibody thiol were liberated and detected upon reduction. The results show that a 30-fold molar excess of reductant selectively liberated 2–3 mol of free thiol (1–1.5 mol of antibody thiol) per mutant antibody molecule. In contrast, the intrinsic disulfides of the native G4 control were not reduced. Antibody reduced for conjugation was stable upon long term storage, for example it did not form aggregate at concentrations as high as 75 μm and remained capable of conjugation over months of storage. The cysteine-reactive reagents, bromoacetyl-TMT, iodoacetyl-TMT, and maleimide-TMT, were each evaluated in conjugation reactions with the cysteine-mutated antibody (data not shown). These reagents were evaluated for selectivity of reaction with cysteine 442 by monitoring incorporation of labeled reagent into both antibody heavy and light chain polypeptides over time at room temperature and 37 °C. Bromoacetyl-TMT provided the best selectivity with essentially no incorporation into antibody light chain polypeptides after 24 h at room temperature and was used in conjugation protocols with engineered cysteines as the reagent of choice. The optimized conditions for antibody reduction and conjugation detailed under “Experimental Procedures” have been used for greater than 50 conjugation reactions involving small scale (<20 mg) and large scale (>20 mg) amounts of antibodies having different constant regions (IgG4 and IgG2) and binding specificities containing the engineered cysteine. Following reduction and using bromoacetyl-TMT as the bifunctional chelator of choice, the typical incorporation of chelator into monoclonal antibody was between 1.0 and 2.0. The metal-free conditions of the conjugation reaction produced protein-TMT conjugates that accepted metal post-conjugation. Most importantly, the binding affinity of the antibody was not affected by the conjugation conditions or incorporation of TMT into the introduced cysteine in the heavy chain. 1209W95 is a humanized version of mouse parent 323A/3 that contains a mutated G4 constant region with the engineered cysteine at position 442 conjugated to TMT. This antibody conjugate was used to prove that conjugation was in fact site-specific. 1209W95 was radiolabeled with lutetium-177, and TLC analysis indicated that 100% of the radiolabel was associated with the antibody (data not shown). Prior to peptide mapping, the trace-labeled protein conjugate was reduced and alkylated according to standard protocols, and a sample was analyzed by non-reducing gel electrophoresis (Fig.2). As expected, a majority of the radioactivity was associated with the heavy chain polypeptides following reduction and alkylation. Importantly, there is no radioactivity associated with the light chain polypeptides. However, a minimal amount of radioactivity was associated with bands of unknown identity. The radioactivity profile of the Glu-C digest was complex, consisting of three major and two minor peaks. These peaks are labeled A–E in Fig. 3. Very little radioactivity was found in the flow-through fractions, indicating that the radiolabel was stable under the conditions used for reduction, alkylation, digestion, and separation. The UV absorbance profile at 214 nm was extremely complex, indicating that digestion of the antibody had proceeded well. Chromatographic analysis of radioactive fractions from peaks A–E in general yielded one or two major peaks of radioactivity (data not shown). These radioactive fractions were subjected to sequence analysis.Figure 3Radioactivity profile of a Glu-C digest of 1209W95. Proteolytic digestion was performed according to protocols under “Experimental Procedures.” Peptides were eluted from a YMC analytical C-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a 90-min linear gradient"

This exodomain binds hormone with high affinity and specificity and contains eight to nine putative Leu-rich repeat (LRR) sequences. LRRs are known to assume the horseshoe structure in ribonuclease inhibitors, and the inner lining of the horseshoe consists of the β-stranded Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motif. In the case of ribonuclease inhibitors, these β strands interact with ribonuclease. However, it is unclear whether the putative LRRs of LHR and FSHR play any role in the structure and function. In this work, the β-stranded Leu/Ile residues in all LRRs of the human LHR and FSHR were Ala-scanned and characterized. In addition, the 23 residues around LRR2 of LHR were Ala-scanned. The results show that β-stranded Leu and Ile residues in all LRRs are important but not equally. These Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motifs appear to form the hydrophobic core of the LRR loop, crucial for the LRR structure. Interestingly, the hot spots are primarily in the upstream and downstream LRRs of the LHR exodomain, whereas important LRRs spread throughout the FSHR exodomain.

Human reproduction is a major concern as we have been trying to both control and promote human fertility. For example, humans are experiencing a dramatic population increase, yet ∼16% of families suffer from infertility problems. FSHR is present in granulosa cells of the ovary (1Hsueh A.J. Jones P.B. Adashi E.Y. Wang C. Zhuang L.Z. Welsh Jr., T.H. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1983; 69: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Sertoli cells of the testis (2Griswold M.D. Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cells. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993: 496-508Google Scholar). In contrast, LHR is present in luteal and granulosa cells in the ovary and thecal cells in the testis. In the ovary, the expression of FSHR and LHR is dependent on the developmental stage of primordial, primary, secondary (preantral), small antral, large antral, and preovulatory follicles during the ovulation cycle (3Adashi E.Y. Adashi E.Y. Rock J.A. Rosenwaks Z. Reproductive Endocrinology, Surgery, and Technology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 17-40Google Scholar). Therefore, the appearance, action, and disappearance of these receptors are crucially related with the granulosa cell differentiation, follicular development, and ovulation. LHR and FSHR belong to the structurally unique glycoprotein hormone receptor subfamily of the G protein-coupled receptor family (4Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol.

Unlike other receptor subfamilies, they comprise two equal halves, an extracellular N-terminal half (exodomain) and a membrane associated C-terminal half (endodomain) (5McFarland K. Sprengel R.

Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which is structurally equivalent to the entire molecule of many other G protein-coupled receptors such as rhodopsin and adrenergic receptors (4Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Growing evidence suggests that glycoprotein hormones initially bind to the exodomain (4Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) and that the resulting hormone-exodomain complex undergoes a conformational change (20Ji I. Pan Y.-N. Lee Y.-M. Phang T. Ji T.H. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and interacts with the endodomain. This secondary interaction is thought to generate signal in the endodomain (4Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 19Ji T.H. Murdoch W.J. Ji I.

Interestingly, the high affinity hormone binding at the exodomain is modulated by the endodomain (22Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Ryu K. Gilchrist R.L. Tung C. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

This suggests that the exodomain, in particular the hormone contact points, and endodomain are intimately related to each other during the initial and secondary interactions. To understand the underlying mechanism, it is essential to identify the exact hormone contact points in the exodomain. Sequence comparison (Fig. 1, A and B) and modeling suggest that the exodomain contains imperfect Leu/Ile-rich repeats (LRRs) (5McFarland K. Sprengel R. Phillips H. Kohler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1147-1159PubMed Google Scholar), which are flanked by short N- and C-terminal regions. LRRs are a structural motif in a few crystal structures of proteins, namely ribonuclease inhibitors (29Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). However, the imperfect LRR motif is present in a large family of proteins and therefore could be a common structural motif. LRRs comprise divergent 22–29 amino acids with a short β strand consisting of two Leu and/or Ile residues in the alternate sequence (Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile), which is linked by linkers to α helices in parallel to the β strand. In addition, there are four hydrophobic residues at imperfectly matching positions. Therefore, the primary homology among LRRs is the Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motif in β strands. The LRRs found in the crystal structure of ribonuclease inhibitors assume the three-quarter donut structure with the inner lining of β strands and the outer surface of α helices (29Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 30Papageorgiou A.C. Shapiro R. Acharya K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5162-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The inner lining of ribonuclease inhibitor interacts with ribonuclease at multiple contact points (31Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 30Papageorgiou A.C. Shapiro R. Acharya K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5162-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Based on the structure of ribonuclease inhibitors, the possibility has been raised that the inner lining of LRRs in LHR and FSHR may contact LH/CG and FSH (26Jiang X. Dreno M. Buckler D. Cheng S.

Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, there is no experimental evidence for the existence of the LRR structure in LHR and FSHR and the LRRs' interaction with hormone. Mutational and photoaffinity analyses of LHR show that a number of regions and amino acids in the exodomain, particularly in the N-terminal half of the exodomain, either interact with hormone (34Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Phang T. Kundu G. Hong S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30023-30028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Thomas D. Rozell T. Liu X. Segaloff D. Mol.

Narayan P. Puett D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4558-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some of these hormone contact sites are outside of the LRRs (34Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Phang T. Kundu G. Hong S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13841-13847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas certain regions and ionic residues in the LRR region are directly or indirectly important for hormone binding (37Thomas D. Rozell T. Liu X. Segaloff D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 760-768PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bhowmick N. Narayan P. Puett D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4558-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of Leu versus Ile in the eight Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motifs is conserved except one residue between LHR and FSHR. This underscores the potential importance of LRRs in these receptors. These results, however, do not address whether putative LRRs and β strand Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motifs are indeed involved in hormone binding. It is also enigmatic how the two receptors produce totally distinct specificities with the 94% homologous Leu//Ile-X-Leu/Ile motifs. In this study, we examined the conserved β strand Leu/Ile residues of LRRs in the human LHR and FSHR. The results show that β strand Leu and Ile residues in all LRRs are important, suggesting multiple contact sites and crucial roles of LRRs in the receptors. Furthermore, some LRRs are more crucial than others and the crucial LRRs are primarily present in the upstream half LRRs in the LHR exodomain, in contrast to their presence in the C-terminal half LRRs of the FSHR exodomain. This suggests the distinct hormone binding specificity of the two receptors resides at spatially separate sites. In addition, the Ala scan of the sequence around LRR2 in the LHR shows that not only the Ile-X-Ile sequence in the β strand but also other conserved hydrophobic residues are indispensable for hormone binding. These results are compatible with the LRR model structure proposed by Bhowmick et al. (28Bhowmick N. Huang J. Puett D. Isaacs N.W. Lapthorn A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1147-1159PubMed Google Scholar) and show for the first time that LRRs in the gonadotropin receptors, particularly the β Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motifs, play a crucial role. Each mutant human LHR and FSHR cDNA was prepared in a pSELECT vector using the non-polymerase chain reaction-based Altered Sites Mutagenesis System (Promega), sequenced, and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (40Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15970-15973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After subcloning pcDNA3, the mutant cDNAs were sequenced again. Plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method. Stable cell lines were established in minimum essential medium containing 10% horse serum and 500 μg/ml G-418 and then used for hormone binding and cAMP assays. In addition to stable cell lines expressing receptors, some receptors were transiently expressed using varying amounts of plasmid to express different concentrations of mutant receptors. All assays were carried out in duplicate and repeated four to six times. Means and standard variations were calculated. hCG and human FSH were provided by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program and radioiodinated as described previously (41Ji I. Ji T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells were assayed for125I-hormone binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonradioactive hormone. Scatchard plots determined the K d values. For intracellular cAMP assay, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in the medium containing isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 mg/ml) for 15 min. Increasing concentrations of hCG were then added, and the incubation was continued for 45 min at 37 °C. After removing the medium, the cells were rinsed once with fresh medium without isobutylmethylxanthine, lysed in 70% ethanol, freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen, and scraped. After pelleting cell debris at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 10 μl of the cAMP assay buffer that was provided by the manufacturer. cAMP concentrations were determined with an 125I-cAMP assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instruction and validated for use in our laboratory. FLAG-LHR was prepared by inserting the FLAG epitope (42Prikett K. Amberg D. Hopp T. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar), Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (5′-GAC TAC AAG GAC GAT GAC GAT AAG-3′), between the C terminus (Ser26) of the signal sequence and the N terminus (Arg27) of mature receptors. We have shown that the FLAG tag did not significantly impair the activity of wild type and mutant LH/CG-Rs (34Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Also, the FLAG epitope (43Hopp T. Prikett K. Price V. Libby R. March C. Cerretti P. Urdal D. Conlon P. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar) has successfully been used as a marker to identify, trace, and purify recombinant proteins carrying the tag without significantly impairing their biological activities of other molecules (44Guan Z.-M. Kobilka T. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Chiang C. Roeder R. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 62-64PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) was iodinated with125I (41Ji I. Ji T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and 125I-anti-FLAG antibodies were purified on a Sephadex G-150 column. Binding of125I-anti-FLAG to HEK 293 cells expressing FLAG-LH receptors was carried out as described previously (34Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The eight LRRs of LHR and FSHR contain the Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motif, which constitutes the core of the putative β strands present in all LRRs of the glycoprotein hormone receptors and other LRR proteins (29Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). In fact, the presence of Leuversus Ile in the eight Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motifs is conserved except one residue between LHR and FSHR. The exception is that the LRR1 motif is Leu-X-Leu in LHR and Leu-X-Phe in FSHR (Fig. 1,A and B). This 94% homology is striking, particularly in light of the less than 50% homology in the exodomain sequences (46Ji T. Ji I. Kim S. Adashi E. Rock J. Rosenwaks Z. Gonadotropin Receptors. Reproductive Endocrinology, Surgery, and Technology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 21-26Google Scholar) and the distinct hormone binding specificities of LHR and FSHR. In addition to the eight LRRs, there is putative LRR9 in the LHR (28Bhowmick N. Huang J. Puett D. Isaacs N.W. Lapthorn A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1147-1159PubMed Google Scholar), but it lacks the Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motif and the Ala-Phe sequence. Therefore, we focused on LRRs 1–8 in this study. To examine the importance of the Leu and Ile residues in the putative β strands of LHR, they were individually substituted with Ala. Each of the Ala substitution mutants was stably expressed in HEK 293 cells and assayed for 125I-hCG binding on intact cells or after solubilization in Triton X-100 and for hCG-dependent cAMP induction. For example, the cells transfected with the vector carrying the Leu29 → Ala mutant cDNA were incubated with a constant amount of 125I-hCG in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled hCG. The resulting displacement data (Fig. 2 A) did not show hCG binding (Fig. 2 B). To test whether the Leu29→ Ala mutant was capable of binding hCG but trapped in cells, the cells transfected with the Leu29 → Ala mutant vector were solubilized in Triton X-100 and assayed for 125I-hCG binding (Fig. 2, C and D). Again,125I-hCG binding was not observed. Since the cAMP assay is significantly more sensitive than the 125I binding assay, we tested if the cells produce cAMP in response to hCG. cAMP production was insignificant up to 10 nm hCG treatment (Fig.2 E). Although the cells produced cAMP, 2–5% of the maximum cAMP level of the wild type receptor, when treated with 100 nm, we considered it insignificant. This result, however, suggests the surface expression of the mutant receptor. We and others (28Bhowmick N. Huang J. Puett D. Isaacs N.W. Lapthorn A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1147-1159PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 47Abell A. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4518-4527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have shown that mutant receptors that do not bind125I-hCG on intact cells and in solution are more likely to be defective in hormone binding than unexpressed. Therefore, mutant receptors that do not bind hCG on intact cells and in solution are generally considered to be incapable of binding hormone. However, to demonstrate their expression on the cell surface, antibodies were utilized. Because most of anti-LHR antibodies lack high affinity and specificity, the FLAG tag (42Prikett K. Amberg D. Hopp T. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar) was attached to the mutant receptor. The FLAG tag can be detected by monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody band, and it does not interfere with the expression and activity of receptors (34Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 48Hong S. Ryu K.-S. Oh M.-O. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4166-4171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The FLAG-Leu29 → Ala mutant was expressed and assayed for binding monoclonal 125I-anti-FLAG antibody (34Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The antibody bound to the intact cells expressing the FLAG-Leu29 → Ala mutant as well as the FLAG-wild type receptor, indicating the surface expression of the FLAG-Leu29 → Ala mutant (TableI). On the other hand, the antibody did not bind to the cells expressing the wild type LH/CG-R lacking the FLAG tag nor the FLAG-Asp17 → Ala that is known to be trapped in cells but not expressed on the cell surface (34Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results show that the Leu29 → Ala mutant was expressed on the surface but was defective in binding hCG. The fact that anti-FLAG antibody recognized the mutant indicates that the mutant was folded to a conformation similar to that of the wild type FLAG receptor, at least in the FLAG region.Table IAnti-FLAG antibody binding to intact cells125I-Anti-FLAG binding%Wild type LHR5 ± 3Wild type FLAG-LHR100 ± 12FLAG-Leu29 → Ala82 ± 17FLAG-Ile53 → Ala61 ± 15FLAG-Ile55 → Ala59 ± 8FLAG-Ile80 → Ala77 ± 14FLAG-Ile103 → Ala102 ± 23FLAG-Ile105 → Ala68 ± 12FLAG-Asp17→ Ala9 ± 5Mutant LHRs with Ala substitution transiently were expressed on intact cells and assayed for increasing concentrations of125I-anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody binding as previously described (34Hong S.

Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Next, the Leu31 → Ala mutant was examined.125I-hCG bound to intact cells expressing the Leu31 → Ala mutant with a K d value of 690 pm as compared with the wild type value of 600 pm (Fig. 2, A and B). The mutant solubilized in Triton X-100 was also capable of binding the hormone with the affinity similar to the wild type affinity. It also produced cAMP in response to hCG, although the affinity and maximum cAMP level were significantly lower than the wild type receptor. These results show that these two Leu residues of LRR1 responded dissimilarly to Ala substitution. In contrast to the dissimilar sensitivity to Ala substitution for the two Leu residues of LRR1, Ala substitution for the two Ile residues in LRR2 abolished hCG binding on intact cells and in solution as well as cAMP induction, although the two mutants were detected on the cell surface by anti-FLAG antibody (Table I). In LRR3, the Leu/Ile pair comprises Ile78 and Ile80. The Ile78 → Ala mutant was capable of binding 125I-hCG and inducing cAMP (Fig. 2,F–J), but the affinities were lower than the wild type affinities. On the other hand, the Ile80 → Ala mutant was incapable of hormone binding and cAMP induction, despite its expression on the cell surface (Table I). In LRR4, both of the Leu103→ Ala and Ile105 → Ala mutants lost the receptor activities as did the Ile53 → Ala and Ile55→ Ala mutants of LRR2. In LRR5 and LRR6, individual Ala substitutions for Leu128, Ile130, Leu154, and Leu156partially impaired, but did not abolish, the hormone binding and cAMP induction (Fig. 3, A–E). Interestingly, the affinities of hormone binding to intact cells of these mutants were similar, approximately 2-fold lower than the wild type affinity. This result indicates similar impacts of the Ala substitutions. In addition, the binding affinity does not appear to be dependent on the receptor concentration on the cell surface. To test the relationship between the receptor concentration and the binding affinity, cells were transfected with varying concentrations of plasmids carrying the wild type receptor and Leu128 → Ala mutant. Cells expressing varying surface concentrations of the receptors showed similar K d values (TableII). Ala substitutions for the LRR7 and LRR8 residues showed split results (Fig. 3). In LRR7, Leu177 → Ala partially impaired hormone binding and cAMP induction, whereas Leu179 → Ala entirely abolished them. The Leu202 → Ala mutant of LRR8 completely lost the ability to bind the hormone and induce cAMP, but the effect was only partial for the Ile204 → Ala substitution.Table IIReceptor concentration and binding affinityReceptor/cellK dpmWild type16,930 ± 840710 ± 50Wild type31,850 ± 790600 ± 20Wild type79,100 ± 4,500630 ± 40Leu128 → Ala8,560 ± 7401,360 ± 130Leu128 → Ala23,190 ± 3801,470 ± 210Leu128 → Ala31,870 ± 1,0701,430 ± 170To determine the effect of receptor concentrations on the binding affinity, varying concentrations of receptors were transiently expressed on intact cells and assayed for hormone binding. Open table in a new tab To determine the effect of receptor concentrations on the binding affinity, varying concentrations of receptors were transiently expressed on intact cells and assayed for hormone binding. Overall, the results show three distinct LRR groups. In LRR2 and LRR4, both residues of the Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motif are sensitive to Ala substitution; only one residue is sensitive in LRR1, LRR3, LRR7, and LRR8; and neither is sensitive in LRR5 and LRR6. To readily compare various binding affinities of the mutant receptors, the wild typeK d value was divided by each mutant'sK d value (Fig. 4). The lower theK dwt/K dmutratio implies the lower hormone binding affinity of the mutant. All of the mutants have a K d ratio less than the unity, consistent with their lower binding affinities than the wild type affinity. Most of the K d ratios are in the range of 0.2–0.5 except those incapable of hormone binding. This clearly indicates the significant impact of Ala substitution for the conserved Leu/Ile-X-Leu/Ile motif of the putative β strand of LRRs in LHR. It also suggests the importance of the motif in most of LRRs, in par"

Although α subunits of G proteins (Gα) were the first recognized mediators of receptor-effector coupling, Gβγ regulation of effectors is now well known. Five Gβ and 12 Gγ subunit genes have been identified, suggesting through their diversity that specific subunits couple selectively to effectors. The molecular determinants of Gβγ-effector coupling, however, are not well understood, and most studies of G protein-effector coupling do not support selectivity of Gβγ action. To explore this issue further, we have introduced recombinant Gβγ complexes into avian sensory neurons and measured the inhibition of Ca2+ currents mediated by an endogenous phospholipase Cβ- (PLCβ) and protein kinase C-dependent pathway. Activities of Gβγ in the native cells were compared with enzyme assays performed in vitro. We report a surprising selective activation of the PLCβ pathway by Gβγ complexes containing β1 subunits, whereas β2-containing complexes produced no activation. In contrast, when assayed in vitro, PLCβ and type II adenylyl cyclase did not discriminate among these same Gβγ complexes, suggesting the possibility that additional cellular determinants confer specificity in vivo.

Heterotrimeric G proteins are ubiquitous signaling intermediaries, transferring information from a large family of transmitter and hormone receptors in plasma membranes to a variety of cellular effectors, including both enzymes and ion channels (1Hamm H. Gilchrist A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). As in other tissues, G proteins play central roles in nervous system signaling. Many forms of interneuronal communication rely on G protein-coupled receptors, and many G protein-coupled pathways in nervous tissue target ion channels. Mechanisms underlying G protein-induced changes in ion channel function are varied; some involve a direct interaction between G protein subunits and channel subunits (2Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), whereas others require the activation of intervening second messenger pathways (3Dunlap K. Ikeda S.R. Semin. Neurosci. 1998; 9: 198-208Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These diverse mechanisms coexist in some cells, such as embryonic chick sensory neurons, providing the opportunity to explore the similarities and differences among them at the single-cell level. In chick sensory neurons, for example, previous work has demonstrated that α2-adrenergic receptors couple to both Go and Gi (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As for mammalian Ca2+ channels (2Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), Go-induced inhibition of chick N channel function appears to result from a physical interaction between the Ca2+channel α1 subunit and the βγ released from Go (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5Lü Q. Dunlap K. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 265AGoogle Scholar); Gi-induced inhibition, by contrast, acts via a second messenger pathway triggered by βγ released from Gi and its downstream activation of phospholipase C (PLC)1 (6Harish O.E. Role L.W. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1992; 10: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and, subsequently, protein kinase C (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Rane S.R. Walsh M.P. McDonald J.R. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1989; 3: 239-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The fact that Go is unable to activate the kinase-dependent pathway suggests either that PLC activation in these cells is preferentially sensitive to Gβγi or that Go is spatially segregated from PLC. Recent in vitro reconstitution studies of purified or recombinant proteins suggest, however, that the specificity of interaction between Gβγ and PLC is quite limited. For example, purified turkey erythrocyte PLCβ (8Boyer J.L. Graber S.G. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2814-2819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat brain PLCβ3 (9Ueda N. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can be activated by a variety of recombinant Gβγ protein complexes, and no significant differences in potency are observed among the Gβγ pairs tested (whether β1or β2 is combined with γ2, γ3, or γ5). This apparent lack of specificity has also been reported for Gβγ interactions with several other effectors, including adenylyl cyclase types I and II, neuronal Ca2+ channels, and cardiac K+ channels (9Ueda N. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ikeda S.R.

Given that all such studies have employed either reconstitution in cell-free systems or protein overexpression in heterologous cells, it is possible that the failure to observe specific coupling between Gβγ and effectors is due in part to the absence (or insufficiency) of critical factors that would normally be provided at adequate levels by a differentiated host cell. We have, thus, tested for specific coupling between low concentrations of exogenously applied, recombinant Gβγ and a native pathway mediated by PLCβ and PKC. Our assay measured the evoked inhibition of Ca2+ channels via the PLCβ-PKC pathway in these cells. Results demonstrate clear selectivity among different Gβγ complexes, with selectivity residing in Gβ (not Gγ). We then show that these same Gβγ complexes fail to exhibit selectivity in cell-free reconstitution assays of PLCβ and type II adenylyl cyclase (ACII) performed in parallel. These results imply that primary cells exhibit a level of specificity between Gβγ and the PLCβ pathway that is not observed for purified molecules in vitro or when the ratios of the signaling molecules are altered by overexpression. Sensory neurons were dissociated from dorsal root ganglia dissected from 10–12-day-old chick embryos and grown in 35-mm tissue culture dishes according to previously published methods (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Neurons were viewed on the stage of an inverted, compound microscope and used for electrophysiological experiments between 1 and 3 days in culture. Standard tight seal, whole cell voltage clamp methods were used to record current from sensory neurons. Ca2+ currents were activated under voltage-clamp by delivering 25-ms rectangular step depolarizations from the holding potential (−80 mV) to 0 mV and were isolated pharmacologically by blocking voltage-dependent currents through Na+ and K+ channels with 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride and 0.3 μmtetrodotoxin, respectively. The external saline also contained 133 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 12.5 mm NaOH, and 5 mm glucose (pH 7.3). The pipette internal solution contained 150 mm CsCl, 10 mmHEPES, 5 mm Mg ATP, and 5 mmbis(o-aminophenoxy)ethanetetraacetic acid. Pipettes were prepared from VWR microhematocrit capillary tubes; resistances prior to forming tight seals ranged from 1 to 2 megaohms. Ca2+ currents were monitored using a List EPC-7 amplifier and studied as a function of time during extracellular application of transmitters (delivered by gravity flow from a 150-μm diameter “sewer pipe”) or intracellular application of recombinant Gβγ protein (introduced by diffusion via the patch pipette). Antiserum raised against turkey erythrocyte PLCβ (Ab858, kindly provided by G. Waldo and T. K. Harden, Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) was diluted 1:1000 into internal recording solution and introduced into the cells via a patch pipette 10 min prior to testing with transmitter. For experiments involving both antiserum and Gβγ, the antiserum-delivery pipette was carefully retrieved from the cell 10 min after gaining whole cell access, giving the antibody time to diffuse into the cytosol. The antibody-loaded cell was then voltage-clamped with a second patch pipette containing Gβγ. Preimmune serum (at the same dilution) was used as a control. Data were filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz with an ITC-16 interface (Instrutech Corp.), and analyzed using Pulse software (HEKA) on a Macintosh computer. Within the first day in vitro, calcium currents are 90–100% N-type, as defined by their sensitivity to ω-conotoxin GVIA; by day 3 in culture, N current comprises ∼85% of the total, with the remainder being l-type (defined by a sensitivity to 1,4-dihydropyridines) (13Cox D.H. Dunlap K. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 906-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses were prepared for Gα, Gβ, and Gγ. The protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells; Gαi2 and the Gβγ complexes were purified from cell homogenates using methods described in detail elsewhere (14Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Neurosci. 1996; 29: 207-226Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Purified Gβγ stock solutions (10–1000 ng/μl) were stored at −80 °C in buffer containing 20 mmNaHEPES (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 50 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 30 μmAlCl3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.6% CHAPS. Recombinant Gαi2 (5 mg/ml) was activated with GTPγS according to methods of Gilman and co-workers (16Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the day of use, samples were diluted (>1:1000) to desired concentrations in intracellular recording solution and added to a low resistance patch pipette for intracellular application via diffusion from the pipette into the cell. Dilution of vehicle buffer was used as a negative control. Purified Gβγ complexes were assayed for activity against recombinant avian PLCβ and mammalian ACII using established methods. For PLCβ (17Myung C.-S. Yasuda H. Liu W.W. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16595-16603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), CHAPS-solubilized Gβγ complexes (10–100 ng) were equilibrated at 4 °C with a mixture of 1 mm phosphatidyl ethanolamine (bovine heart) and 250 μmphosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (with [inositol-2-3H]inositol bisphosphate) in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 3 mmEGTA, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (total volume 200 μl). Enzyme reactions were initiated with the addition of recombinant avian PLCβ (expressed in and purified from Sf9 cells; Ref. 18Waldo G.L. Paterson A. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and CaCl2 (30 °C, 15 min) and stopped with the addition of 200 μl 10% trichloroacetic acid (4 °C). Following centrifugation of precipitated protein and inositol bisphosphate, [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate released into the supernatant was quantified using liquid scintillation spectrometry. To measure Gβγ-induced activation of ACII (19Fletcher J.E. Lindorfer M.A. DeFilippo J.M. Yasuda H. Guilmard M. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 636-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), membranes from Sf9 cells expressing recombinant rat ACII were reconstituted with 10 nm recombinant Gαs (pre-activated with GTPγS) and varying concentrations of Gβγ in a reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mmphosphocreatine, 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.4 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After 7 min at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1n HCl, and cyclic AMP was measured by radioimmunoassay (20Brooker G. Terasaki W.L. Price M.G. Science. 1976; 194: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Membranes and cytosol were prepared from dorsal root ganglia and brain tissue dissected from 11–12-day-old chick embryos by homogenizing in 200 μl of cold buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μl of Sigma protease inhibitor mixture, 0.1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride) followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 2 min in a microcentrifuge (4 °C) to remove cellular debris, then at high speed to pellet membranes. Supernatant (cytosol) was removed and membranes resuspended in 100 μl of buffer noted above. Samples (30–100 μg of protein) were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Protein was electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol, and 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate (200 mA, 2.5–3 h) and processed for chemiluminescent detection (ECL kit, Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary antibody, Ab858 (21Waldo G.L. Morris A.J. Klapper D.G. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 480-489PubMed Google Scholar), was used at a 1:1000 dilution; preimmune serum was tested in parallel (on a separate blot) at the same dilution. We have shown previously that norepinephrine (NE), via α2-adrenergic receptors, inhibits N-type (ω-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive) Ca2+ channels in sensory neurons through two pathways: one mediated by Go and the other by Gi (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our previous results using function-blocking G protein antibodies and Gβγ purified from turkey erythrocytes demonstrate that the Gi pathway (the focus of the current investigation) involves Gβγ and PKC (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and suggest that PLC links the two (6Harish O.E. Role L.W. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1992; 10: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As Gβγ is known to activate the β isoforms of PLC in other systems (18Waldo G.L. Paterson A. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), we employed a function-blocking antiserum raised against turkey erythrocyte PLCβ (Ab858) to test whether the antibody would interfere with NE- and Gβγ-induced inhibition of Ca2+ channels, as expected if PLCβ is a necessary target for Gβγ action. On a Western blot, Ab858 binds to a protein from chick dorsal root ganglia whose mobility is very similar to that of recombinant turkey erythrocyte PLCβ (Fig. 1 A). An additional band at >220 kDa in DRG membranes labeled by Ab858 was also present in control blots exposed to preimmune serum (data not shown) and was, therefore, considered nonspecific. The fact that Ab858 recognized PLCβ in the chick DRG neurons suggested that it would likely prove useful in experiments testing the involvement of PLCβ in G protein-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ channels. In electrophysiological assays, Ab858 was introduced at 1:1000 dilution into sensory neurons via the patch pipette; after 10 min exposure to the antiserum, cells were tested for their responsiveness to 100 μm NE and compared with control cells exposed for the same amount of time to standard internal solution or internal solution containing a 1:1000 dilution of preimmune serum. The cells used for this experiment were from platings in which only the Gi/PKC-dependent form of inhibition was present (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). NE reduced Ca2+ current by 30 ± 6% in control cells, and its effect was eliminated by intracellular application of Ab858 (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, preimmune serum did not alter NE-mediated inhibition, indicating a specific effect of Ab858. Intracellular application of Gβγ bypasses the NE receptor and activates the Gi/PKC pathway directly (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To test for an effect of Ab858 on direct Gβγ-mediated inhibition, we first introduced the antiserum via a patch pipette, which was withdrawn from the cell 10 min after achieving whole cell access; a second pipette containing 20 nm recombinant Gβ1γ2 was then used to introduce Gβγ and voltage-clamp the cell. In the absence of Ab858, Gβ1γ2 produced an average 46 ± 4% inhibition of Ca2+ current, similar to results observed previously using purified turkey erythrocyte Gβγ (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The inhibition by Gβ1γ2 was reduced by 81% in cells exposed to Ab858 (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that a form of PLCβ is an essential component in the modulatory pathway activated by NE and Gβγ. To further investigate the specificity of Ab858, we tested the cells for responsiveness to 100 μm γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), another transmitter that inhibits sensory neuron Ca2+ channels but that does not couple to the Gi/PLCβ/PKC pathway (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23Diversé-Pierluissi M. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1993; 10: 753-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast to results with NE and Gβγ, GABA-mediated inhibition (32 ± 5% in control cells) was unaltered in antibody-treated cells (Fig. 1 B), further indicating that Ab858 acts selectively on the Gi/PLCβ/PKC pathway. Thus, the modulation of sensory neuron Ca2+ current can be used as a sensitive single-cell assay for interactions between Gβγ and PLCβ. To evaluate the degree of selectivity with which Gβγ complexes interact with chick sensory neuron PLCβ pathway, recombinant Gβγs composed of either β1 or β2 and one of four γ subunits (γ1, γ2, γ3, or γ5) were screened. Each of the complexes was tested initially at 20 nm, a concentration established as saturating in previous experiments with turkey erythrocyte Gβγ (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Full concentration-response relationships were pursued for the complexes found to be effective at 20 nm, and ineffective complexes were tested at 100 nm as well. The relationship between Gβγ concentration and the rate of inhibition was first established in order to ensure that responses were measured near equilibrium for all concentrations tested. The active complexes produced a time-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ current that could be discerned within 80 s of achieving pipette access to the cell interior and was maximal in ∼5 min (Fig. 2 A). Lower concentrations of Gβγ produced smaller responses (see below), which proceeded along a slower time course (data not shown), indicative that the rate of channel inhibition parallels the rate at which Gβγ equilibrates with the intracellular compartment. Measurements were routinely taken over a 10-min period after achieving whole cell access. During this time, a small diminution in current amplitude was observed in cells exposed to control internal solutions; such “run-down” was less than 1%/min; in each experiment, the average run-down was calculated from 5 control cells from the same plating and used to correct the measurements made in Gβγ-treated cells. On average, 20 nm Gβ1γ2produced a maximum 56 ± 6% (n = 6) inhibition of peak Ca2+ current, and raising the concentration to 100 nm produced no greater inhibition (57 ± 6%,n = 3). As described previously for the endogenous Gi-dependent modulatory pathway (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the inhibition of Ca2+ current produced by the recombinant protein was characterized by a lack of voltage dependence (Fig.2 B) and no change in current activation rate. Such effects of Gβγ have been shown to be attenuated by a pseudosubstrate domain inhibitor of PKC (7Rane S.R. Walsh M.P. McDonald J.R. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1989; 3: 239-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), consistent with the involvement of PKC. Only certain Gβγ complexes tested were able to inhibit Ca2+ current. With the exception of Gβ1γ1 (transducin Gβγ), all complexes containing Gβ1 were effective against Ca2+current (see below). By contrast, all complexes containing Gβ2 were inactive at 20 nm (see, for example, Fig. 2 A). Two of these β2-containing dimers (β2γ3 and β2γ5) were tested at 100 nm as well and found inactive. To test for variability in activities among different preparations of Gβγ, we compared two separate preparations of Gβ1γ2 and Gβ2γ2. Both samples of Gβ1γ2 were equally effective, with 20 nm inhibiting Ca2+ current by 56 ± 6 (n = 6) and 52 ± 6 (n = 7). Likewise, the two samples of Gβ2γ2 were equally ineffective against N current when tested at 20 nm. Gαi2-GTPγS was also inactive against Ca2+current when applied at 20 nm (Fig. 2 A); furthermore, Gαi2-GDP blocked the inhibition produced by β1γ2 when the two subunits were applied to the cells in equimolar concentrations (Fig.3 A). The magnitude of blockade was a function of the relative concentrations of Gβ1γ2 and Gαi2-GDP; addition of 60 pm Gαi2-GDP produced a significant rightward shift in the concentration-response relationship for Gβ1γ2 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, Gα is not the active subunit mediating the Ca2+ current inhibition. Taken together, these results provide strong support for specific coupling between Gβγ complexes and the PLCβ-PKC pathway targeting Ca2+ channels in native cells. Although Gβ2-containing complexes did not inhibit N current, they were found to be active in a number of independent assays. For example, Gβ2γ3 was an effective potentiator of a second type of Ca2+ current (l-type) in these cells. Previous results from our laboratory demonstrated that L channels (defined by a sensitivity to 1,4-dihydropyridine antagonists) are responsible for approximately 15% of the total Ca2+ current in cells 3 days in vitro (13Cox D.H. Dunlap K. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 906-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and L current can be studied in isolation by eliminating N current with ω-conotoxin GVIA. Interestingly, 20 nm Gβ2γ3 (which, as shown above, produces no effect on N current) potentiates l-type current (Fig. 4), indicating that the G protein complex is biologically active. Given that Gβ1-containing complexes are inactive against L channels (data not shown), these results make a strong argument for specific coupling between Gβγ complexes and pathways that modulate Ca2+ channel function, with Gβ1γ x coupling to pathways that target N channels and Gβ2γ x coupling to pathways that target L channels. To further address the general issue of relative activities among the recombinant Gβγs, the proteins were also tested for their abilities to activate recombinant PLCβ and ACII in vitro. As illustrated in Fig.5, the Gβγ complexes effectively activated these two enzymes at concentrations similar to those used in the electrophysiological assays. In contrast to the latter experiments, however, Gβ1-containing and Gβ2-containing complexes do not exhibit significantly different potencies in the biochemical assays. Gβ1γ2 and Gβ2γ2 activated PLCβ with apparent potencies of 2.6 and 3.5 nm, respectively, whereas their apparent potencies against ACII were 8.8 and 13.7, respectively (Fig.5). These results suggest that variations in intrinsic activity among the recombinant Gβγ proteins cannot explain the inability of Gβ2-containing complexes to modulate the N-type Ca2+ current, reinforcing the conclusion that Gβγ-PLCβ coupling in these neurons is selective and dictated by the Gβ subunit. We investigated the concentration-response relationships for the Gβ1γ complexes found to be active at 20 nm in the initial screen in order to determine whether chick sensory neuron PLCβ prefers certain Gβ1γ complexes over others. Concentrations between 20 pm and 100 nm were tested as before by adding the protein to the pipette solutions and measurements were made as described above. The relationships for Gβ1γ2, Gβ1γ3, Gβ1γ5, and purified rat brain Gβγ (a mixture of multiple complexes) are plotted in Fig.6. No significant differences in potency, efficacy, or time course between the different recombinant complexes were observed. In contrast, Gβγ purified from rat brain was significantly less potent than the recombinant proteins (EC50 value >300 pm). This is likely due to the fact that the purified protein is a mixture of Gβγ complexes present in rat brain tissue, including those complexes containing Gβ2 that are inactive against N current. It was not possible to determine whether the efficacy of the purified protein was also reduced relative to recombinant complexes, as saturation was not reached at the highest concentrations of rat brain Gβγ tested. When tested with the particular Gβγ subunits used here, therefore, the activity of the PLCβ pathway appears independent of the Gγ subunit. This is perhaps not surprising since the Gγ subunits tested are similar to one another both in structure and prenyl modification. Some Gγ-mediated specificity was demonstrated in a previous study, however, that compared the activities of Gβ1γ2 (naturally modified with a geranylgeranyl group) with Gβ1γ11(naturally modified with a farnesyl group). Gβ1γ2 was found to be more effective than Gβ1γ11 in activating PLCβ in vitro; switching the prenyl groups reduced activity of Gβ1γ2 and increased activity of Gβ1γ11 (17Myung C.-S. Yasuda H. Liu W.W.

In addition to prenyl modification, the primary structure of the Gγ N termini was also important for Gβγ-induced activation of ACIIin vitro (17Myung C.-S. Yasuda H. Liu W.W. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C.

That Gβ subunits control Gβγ interactions with other proteins is strongly supported by structural studies. Crystal structures of heterotrimers demonstrate that Gα interacts directly with Gβ, but not with Gγ (reviewed in Ref. 24Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 175-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis combined with yeast two-hybrid assays of binding activity have identified the N terminus of Gβ as the functionally important Gα interaction domain and also demonstrated that Gγ does not interact with Gα (25Yan K. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2056-2059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The fact that Gα-GDP attenuates Gβγ-mediated signaling in our studies further suggests that the domain(s) responsible for Gα-Gβγ coupling very likely overlap with those for Gβγ-effector coupling. Mutations in the Gα interacting domain on Gβ that prevent its binding to Gα also abrogate Gβ interactions with ACII, GIRK1 K+ channels, and PLCβ2 (25Yan K. Gautam N. J. Biol.

Taken together, our in vivo results demonstrate a level of specificity between Gβγ and PLCβ that has generally not been observed in previous in vitro studies in which a variety of Gβ1-, Gβ2-, and Gβ5-containing complexes were tested in enzymatic assays against purified turkey erythrocyte, bovine brain, or rat brain isoforms of PLCβ (8Boyer J.L.

The recombinant complexes have been reported to lack selectivity in interactions with other effector proteins as well, including neuronal Ca2+ channels, and GIRK1 K+ channels in heart (9Ueda N.

It is unclear why our results show greater selectivity in Gβγ-effector interactions than those previously reported. Several interesting possibilities may be considered, however. 1) The apparent affinities of Gβ1γ x s in our single cell experiments are approximately 30-fold higher than those measured in most cell-free enzymatic assays (including our own, see Fig. 5); it is, thus, possible that specificity is masked when higher Gβγ concentrations are employed for activation. This cannot be the entire explanation, however, since concentrations of Gβ2γ x complexes well above those demonstrated to activate PLCβ in vitro (e.g.100 nm) are still insufficient to produce detectable inhibition of the N-type Ca2+ currents recorded here. Furthermore, in vitro reconstitution assays of Gβγ-mediated activation of PLCβ that utilize a preparation of column-purified unilamellar vesicles (in which all Gβγ is lipid-associated) demonstrate potencies of Gβγ similar to those of the single-cell assays reported here, but no significant differences among the tested Gβγ complexes were observed (30Myung C.-S Paterson A. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). 2) Intact cells may contain interacting proteins (absent in in vitro reconstitution systems) that restrict or promote access between specific Gβγ complexes and α subunits or effector proteins. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that the three Gαo subunits (the alternatively spliced Gαo1 and Gαo2 forms; Ref. 31Hsu W.H. Rudolph U. Sanford J. Bertrand P. Olate J. Nelson C. Moss L.G. Boyd A.E. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11220-11226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the deamidated form (Gαo3; Ref. 32McIntire W.E. Schey K.L. Knapp D.R. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14651-14658Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) display preferential association with the known Gβ and Gγ isoforms. For example, Gαo3 purifies with Gβγ complexes containing mainly Gγ2 or Gγ3 rather than with Gγ7, which is found in abundance with the other isoforms (33Wilcox M.D. Dingus J. Balcueva E.A. McIntire W.E. Mehta N.D. Schey K.L. Robishaw J.D. Hildebrandt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4189-4192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Gαo1 and Gαo3 isoforms purify with Gβγ complexes containing the Gβ1 subunit, and the Gαo2 isoform prefers Gβγ complexes containing the Gβ2 subunit (34Exner T. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Kleuss C. Nurnberg B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given that G proteins exist in oligomeric signaling complexes with receptors and effectors (35Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar), if Gαo were to associate preferentially with Gβ2γ x complexes in chick DRG cells, the specific interaction could explain the inability of Go-coupled receptors (such as GABAB receptors) to inhibit Ca2+ channels through the endogenous PLCβ-PKC pathway. Considerable precedent suggests that such forms of spatial organization can greatly enhance the downstream efficacy of intracellular signaling complexes (36Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 37Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D.M. Davignon I., Yu, K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3549-3556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Pathways that target Ca2+ channels are no exception in this regard. Recent studies, for example, demonstrate that syntaxin 1A binds to both voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel α1 subunits and Gβγ complexes and, in so doing, promotes the inhibition of N current by a mechanism that remains to be determined (38Jarvis S.E. Magga J.M. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E.A. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). One possibility is that syntaxin 1A increases the local concentration of Gβγ near its binding sites on the N channel α1 subunit, but whether syntaxin 1A also provides enhanced selectivity among Gβγs has not been tested. Thus, the selective targeting of particular Gβγs to PLCβ as a means of bringing about selective inhibition of Ca2+ channels remains to be tested. 3) Alternatively, intact cells may contain modulating factors (missing in the reconstitution assays) that selectively enhanceinteractions between effectors and particular Gβγ complexes. This notion is consistent with the 30-fold enhancement of apparent Gβγ affinity observed in our single cell experiments. In the studies cited above, syntaxin 1A overexpression shifts the potency of Gβγ applied to the bulk internal solution (38Jarvis S.E. Magga J.M. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E.A. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although such changes in apparent affinity might result from a localized increase in Gβγ concentration near its binding site on the N channel α1subunit, syntaxin 1A might also increase N channel sensitivity to Gβγ through some modulatory action of its own, conferred by its binding to the channel. One in vivo study of pancreatic acinar cells demonstrates that selective interactions between G protein-coupled receptors and regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins determines the signaling specificity between Gαqand PLCβ (37Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D.M. Davignon I., Yu, K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3549-3556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); although there is, as yet, no evidence of a similar action of receptor complexes on Gβγ-mediated signaling, it remains a possibility that should be explored. One additional in vivo study describes specificity of coupling between effectors and specific Gβγ complexes, and provides the interesting additional observation that the degree of selectivity among Gβγ complexes is likely to vary for different effectors: these studies, using transfected COS-7 cells, demonstrate that Gβ1γ2 (but not Gβ5γ2) stimulates mitogen activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, whereas both complexes stimulate PLCβ2 equally well (28Zhang S. Coso O.A. Lee C. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33575-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Comparison of such results with those reported here reinforces the notion that Gβγ-effector interactions are a sensitive function of local environment. As a result, it seems likely that interactions between particular Gβγs and their target effectors will vary among cells due to variations in expression levels of accessory molecules with power to modulate Gβγ-effector interactions. Future work must focus on confirming this idea, and, if it proves correct, identifying the additional cellular factors that mediate the selectivity of Gβγ action. We thank Ravi Iyengar and T. Kendall Harden for comments on the manuscript."

This enhancer is contained within a 115-nucleotide FspI-PvuII (FP) fragment located in the middle of the last exon (exon 5). Previous work showed that the splicing factor SF2/ASF binds to this FP region and stimulates splicing of intron D in vitro. However, the precise sequences recognized by SF2/ASF within the FP region had not been determined. Here we used multiple strategies to map the SF2/ASF binding sites and determine their importance for ESE function. Taking advantage of the fact that SF2/ASF ultraviolet (UV) cross-links specifically to RNA containing the FP sequence, we first mapped a major SF2/ASF binding site by UV cross-linking and reverse transcription. This strategy identified a 29-nucleotide SF2/ASF binding region in the middle of the FP sequence containing the 7-nucleotide purine-rich motif described previously. Interestingly, this binding region is neither sufficient, nor absolutely required for SF2/ASF-mediated splicing, suggesting that additional SF2/ASF binding sites are present. The location of these additional sites was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of various subfragments of the FP sequence. Antisense 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides complementary to selected SF2/ASF binding sites block bovine growth hormone intron D splicing.

Members of this family are characterized by one or two RNA-recognition motifs and a C-terminal domain with extensive arginine/serine repeats (RS domain). They include the proteins SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp20, SRp30c, 9G8, SRp40, SRp55, SRp75, and p54. These proteins are thought to be essential for splicing, given that splicing of synthetic pre-mRNA substrates does not occur in cytosolic S100 extracts, which contain only trace amounts of SR proteins, until at least one SR protein is added (4Krainer A.R.

In at least some pre-mRNAs, SR proteins may actually recognize and bind to the 5′-splice site prior to the binding of U1 snRNP (11Zuo P. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At high concentrations, SR proteins can compensate for the removal or inactivation of U1 snRNP (12Tarn W.-Y. Steitz J.A.

However, it is clear that the role of SR proteins is more complex than just stimulating U1 snRNP binding to the 5′-splice site. Exon sequences that are generally purine-rich were discovered as global splicing enhancer signals, and thus, became known as ExonicSplicing Enhancers (ESE) (14Watakabe A. Tanaka K. Shimura Y.

However, in some cases it appears that binding of SR proteins to the splicing enhancer sequences is indirect, resulting from recruitment by other splicing factors to the enhancer complex (20Tian M.

SR proteins appear to be key players in enhancing splicing, perhaps using their RS domains to recruit factors such as U2AF to the 3′-splice site (18Wu J.Y. Maniatis T.

Splicing of the last intron (intron D) of the bovine growth hormone (bGH) pre-mRNA requires the presence of a downstream splicing enhancer in the last exon (17Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Hampson R.K. LaFollette L. Rottman F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This ESE is contained within a 115-nucleotide FspI-PvuII (FP) fragment in the middle of exon 5 (42Hampson R.K. LaFollette L. Rottman F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The SR protein SF2/ASF binds specifically to the FP region and, presumably as a result of this binding, it enhances splicing of the bGH intron D in vitro (19Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence that a purine-rich sequence in the middle of the FP sequence is part of the bGH ESE sequence (17Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was not clear whether SF2/ASF binds to this purine-rich sequence and/or to adjacent regions. In this study, we take advantage of the fact that SF2/ASF binds to the FP sequence in the absence of other proteins and utilize this simplified recognition event to study one of the earliest steps in splicing, ESE recognition. Mapping of SF2/ASF cross-links to the FP sequence and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that there are multiple SF2/ASF binding sites within the FP sequence, including a site that is centered around the previously described purine motif (17Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of these SF2/ASF binding sites was established by specific inhibition of bGH intron D splicing by antisense 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides complementary to selected binding sites. Thus, multiple SF2/ASF binding sites within the FP element are required for maximal enhancer activity. The plasmids pbGH-4D5 (43Sun Q. Hampson R.K. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15659-15666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pE5/FP (19Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and pSP64-HβΔ6 (44Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) have been described. pSP64-HβΔ6 was subcloned into the pBS M13+ vector (Stratagene) to drive expression of β-globin from the T3 promoter. Plasmid pΔUV-XL was constructed by creating a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-derived fragment of bGH using oligonucleotide BS-44 (5′-GCCTGTAGGGGAGGGTGGAA-3′) and oligonucleotide ΔUV-XL (5′-ACGTCTCCGTGCAGACCGTAG-3′) as upstream and downstream primers, respectively. This fragment was then subcloned into theApaI and RsaI sites of pbGH/4D5. Plasmid pUV-XL was constructed by creating a PCR-derived fragment of bGH using oligonucleotide T3 (5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-3′) and oligonucleotide UV-XL (5′-CTTATGCAGGTCCTTCCGGAAGCAGGAGAGCATGTTTGTG-3′) as upstream and downstream primers, respectively. This fragment was then subcloned into the PstI and PvuII sites of pbGH/4D5. Plasmids pE5/ΔFP/UV-XL and pE5/FP/ΔUV-XL were constructed by removing the HindIII-SmaI fragments from plasmids pUV-XL and pΔUV-XL, respectively. pE5/ΔFP plasmids containing the various FP subfragments inserted in place of the FP sequence were constructed by creating full-length PCR-derived plasmids containing the individual inserts using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In each case, the same upstream primer (5′-CTGTGCCTTCTAGTTGCCAGC-3′) was used, whereas the downstream primer varied according to the FP subfragment inserted: FP subfragment 1 (5′-CGCGTCGTCACTGCGCATGTTTGTG-3′); FP subfragment 2 (5′-TAGTTCTTGAGCAGGCATGTTTGTG-3′); FP subfragment 3 (5′-CAGGAGAGCAGACCGGCATGTTTGTG-3′); FP subfragment 4 (5′-CAGGTCCTTCCGGAAGGCATGTTTGTG-3′); FP subfragment 5 (5′-TACGTCTCCGTCTTATGGCATGTTTGTG-3′); FP subfragment 6 (5′-CATGACCCTCAGGTGCATGTTTGTG-3′); FP subfragment 7 (5′-AGCGGCGGCACTTCGCATGTTTGTG-3′); FP subfragment 8 (5′-CTGGCCTCCCCGAAGCATGTTTGTG-3′); and FP subfragment 9 (5′-CCCTCAGGTACGTCTCCGCATGTTTGTG-3′). Oligonucleotides T3 primer (5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-3′) and FP-17mer (5′-CTGGCCTCCCCGAAGCG-3′) were purchased from National Biosciences (NBI). 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides B1 (5′-GmCmGmCmGmUmCmGmUmCmAmCmUmGm-3′), B2 (5′-GmUmUmCmUmUmGmAmGmCmAmGmCmGm-3′), B3 (5′-CmCmGmGmAmAmGmCmAmGmGmAmGmAm-3′), B4 (5′-CmUmUmAmUmGmCmAmGmGmUmCmCmUm-3′), B5 (5′-AmCmUmUmCmAmUmGmAmCmCmCmUmCm-3′), B6 (5′-CmAmGmCmUmGmGmCmCmUmCmCmCmCm-3′), B7 (5′-CmAmAmAmCmAmAmCmAmGmAmUmGmGm-3′), B8 (5′-CmGmGmGmGmGmAmGmGmGmGmCmAmAm-3′), were purchased from Oligos, Etc (lowercase m denotes each 2′-O-methyl group). Human SF2/ASF (0.113 mg/ml) was purified from HeLa cell nuclear extract as described (45Mayeda A. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2993-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). 6-Histidine-tagged recombinant human SF2/ASF (46Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Kozak D. Binns G. Cell. 1991; 66: 383-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) (0.25 mg/ml) was expressed in Sf21 cells using the BacPAK baculovirus expression system (CLONTECH) and purified using a Ni-agarose affinity resin (Life Technologies) according to instructions of the manufacturer. Human recombinant hnRNP A1 (0.2 mg/ml) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (47Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The anti-SF2/ASF monoclonal antibody (mAb96) is specific and does not cross-react with other SR proteins (48Hanamura A. Cáceres J.F. Mayeda A. Franza Jr., B.R. Krainer A.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 430-444PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-hnRNP A1 mAb 4B10 was a generous gift from Drs. G. Dreyfuss and S. Piñol-Roma. [α-32P]GTP-labeled E5/FP RNA (16–18 ng/0.4 pmol) was incubated under standard splicing conditions (43Sun Q. Hampson R.K. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15659-15666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with either 266 ng of SF2/ASF purified to apparent homogeneity from HeLa cells or 400 ng of purified recombinant hnRNP A1 in 25-μl reactions at 30 °C for 25 min. The reaction mixtures were then transferred to a microtiter plate and exposed to UV light (254 nm) at a distance of 4 cm for 15 min on ice using a UV lamp (15 watts; G15T8, General Electric). Anti-SF2/ASF monoclonal antibody mAb96 (100-μl culture supernatant) and anti-hnRNP A1 mAb 4B10 (2.5-μl ascites fluid) were each prebound to 50 μl of protein A-agarose (50%) in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h and washed three times with 1 ml of IP buffer for 15 min at 4 °C. The monoclonal antibody/protein A-agarose complexes were resuspended in 500 μl of IP buffer, and the bound, cross-linked SF2/ASF-E5/FP RNA and hnRNP A1-E5/FP RNA reactions were added. The suspensions were mixed at 4 °C for 2 h. After three washes with 1 ml of IP buffer for 15 min at 4 °C, the cross-linked E5/FP RNAs were recovered by incubating the beads in 400 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 μg/μl proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C with intermittent mixing, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purified RNAs were then reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Life Technologies) under the following conditions. Equal counts of untreated, cross-linked and/or immunoprecipitated E5/FP RNAs were mixed with 10 pmol of either oligonucleotide FP-17mer or T3 primer in a volume of 6 μl of double distilled H2O and were denatured for 3 min at 90 °C. After brief cooling on ice, each reaction was brought up to a final volume of 20 μl with reagents, including buffers provided by the manufacturer, i.e. 20–40 units of RNase inhibitor (RNasin, Promega), 200 units of Superscript II, 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 0.5 μl of 100 μm dCTP, and 4.5 μl of a 2 mm mix of the remaining three dNTPs. Reverse transcription was done at 45 °C for 1 h. RNAs were degraded by addition of 20 μl of 0.4 m NaOH and incubation at 65 °C for 30 min, and cDNAs were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels along with appropriate controls. Capped RNAs were synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase for the bGH and β-globin pre-mRNAs and for the UV-XL and ΔUV-XL RNAs (produced from plasmids pE5/ΔFP/UV-XL and pE5/FP/ΔUV-XL linearized withEcoRI and PvuII, respectively) and T7 RNA polymerase for the E5/FP RNA (produced from pE5/FP (19Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) linearized with either BamHI or PvuII) with conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene) using [α-32P]GTP to label the RNA. In vitrosplicing reactions (12.5 μl) were performed with HeLa cell nuclear extract at 30 °C for 75 min, as described (43Sun Q. Hampson R.K. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15659-15666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotide inhibition experiments, the oligoribonucleotides were preincubated with the pre-mRNAs at 0 °C for 15–30 min before addition of the nuclear extract. Uncapped, [α-32P]GTP-labeled E5/FP, E5/ΔFP (±FP subfragment inserts), E5/FP/ΔUV-XL, and E5/ΔFP/UV-XL RNAs were synthesized for these assays. Each reaction (25 μl) contained 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 unit/μl RNasin, 0.08 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of yeast tRNA, 10% glycerol, 125 ng of recombinant baculovirus SF2/ASF, and approximately 3 fmol of the indicated RNA. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and resolved on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 50 mm Tris, 50 mmglycine. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 14 V/cm for 2 h. Our earlier work showed that SF2/ASF binds specifically to the 115-nucleotide FP/ESE sequence in exon 5, but not to the remaining regions of this exon (19Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear whether this binding occurred at a purine-rich sequence centered around a 10-base pair palindrome in the middle of the ESE, which can serve as a moderate splicing enhancer (17Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Hampson R.K. LaFollette L. Rottman F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) was shown to counteract the SF2/ASF-mediated enhancement of intron D splicing, although it binds to the FP element with lower specificity than SF2/ASF (19Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To determine more precisely where SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 bind within the FP element, we took advantage of the fact that both SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 can be cross-linked to the E5/FP RNA sequence in the absence of additional protein factors. In separate reactions, purified SF2/ASF and recombinant hnRNP A1 were UV-cross-linked to the E5/FP RNA under splicing conditions, as previously reported (19Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The UV-cross-linked complexes were immunoprecipitated with the corresponding antibodies, and the purified RNAs were then analyzed by primer extension after digestion of the protein with proteinase K. The data obtained with SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 are shown in Fig. 1, A andB, respectively. The precise location of the cross-links was determined by comparison to a dideoxy sequencing ladder of untreated E5/FP RNA (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 1–4), taking into account that reverse transcriptase terminates DNA synthesis at the nucleotide that immediately precedes a cross-link site (49Burgin A.B. Pace N.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4111-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To identify bands due to secondary structure-mediated strong stops, untreated RNA was analyzed (lane 5). To assign bands due to RNA-RNA cross-links or other photodamage, E5/FP RNA was UV-cross-linked in the absence of protein and reverse-transcribed (lane 6). To rule out bands resulting from nicking of the RNA during the experiment, RNA was incubated in the presence of protein and immunoprecipitated but not UV-irradiated (lane 7). Finally, to identify specific protein-RNA cross-links, RNA was incubated in the presence of protein and then either reverse-transcribed directly (lane 8) or immunoprecipitated and then reverse-transcribed (lane 9). It was expected that specific cross-links would appear in lane 8 and be enriched in lane 9. Cross-links judged to be specific for SF2/ASF or hnRNP A1 were compiled and are shown in Fig.2. The relative size of thevertical bar over or under a specific nucleotide in Fig. 2reflects the degree to which a particular cross-link can be distinguished from background bands in the control lanes. The SF2/ASF cross-links are centered around the purine-rich sequence described previously (underlined in Fig. 2; see Ref. 17Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the hnRNP A1 cross-links are spread throughout the 3′-half of the FP sequence. The partial overlap of the SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 cross-links provided a potential explanation for how hnRNP A1 counteracts the SF2/ASF-mediated stimulation of intron D splicing. However, attempts to determine if this overlap is important for the antagonistic effects of SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, the fact that different bands are observed with SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 further supports the conclusion that these bands are a result of specific cross-links to these proteins and not an artifact of the procedure.Figure 2Location of specific SF2/ASF and hnRNP A1 cross-links within the FP region. Specific cross-links identified in Fig. 1 are shown superimposed on the FP sequence. SF2/ASF cross-links are shown above, and hnRNP A1 cross-links below, the FP sequence. The sizes of the vertical bars over specific ribonucleotides reflect the degree to which a particular cross-link can be distinguished from background bands in the control lanes. UV cross-links near the 3′-end of the FP sequence were identified by performing the experiment with E5/FP RNA synthesized from plasmid E5/FP linearized at a PvuII site in the vector and reverse-transcribed with an oligonucleotide complementary to the T3 promoter (T3 primer). The underlined nucleotides represent the purine motif previously shown to be part of the bGH ESE (17Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lines above the sequence indicate the nucleotides that are included in constructs UV-XL and ΔUV-XL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine if the cross-links identified above are indeed from a functional SF2/ASF binding site, a 29-nucleotide sequence containing the nucleotides that cross-link to SF2/ASF was either deleted from the bGH RNA substrate (ΔUV-XL, Fig. 2) or inserted in place of the entire 115-nucleotide FP element (UV-XL, Fig. 2). If SF2/ASF functional binding is confined to this region, it might be expected that ΔUV-XL would behave like the FP deletion (ΔFP), i.e. it would not splice in vitro, even with the addition of SF2/ASF (19Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 43Sun Q. Hampson R.K. Rottman F.M. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 51-54PubMed Google Scholar). Since broad spectrum neuropeptide antagonists could provide a novel approach to the treatment of SCLC and other solid cancers, an understanding of their mechanism of action will be critical for their further development.Several models have been proposed to explain the molecular mechanism(s) by which agonists promote GPCR activation (see Ref. 42Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar for review). The widely used conformational selection model envisages that GPCRs cycle spontaneously (i.e. in the absence of ligand) between different conformational states: the inactive (R) and the active (R*) state (42Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Agonists are thought to stabilize the active conformation of the receptor thereby increasing the probability for receptor-mediated activation of G protein (42Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Receptors capable of activating two different G proteins (e.g. the bombesin/GRP receptor that interacts with Gq and G12) have been proposed to exist in three conformational states as follows: an inactive state that is favored energetically in the absence of agonist (R), a state that activates G12 (R* 1) and a state that activates Gq (R* 2). In this context, Jarpe and collaborators (43Jarpe M.B. Knall C. Mitchell F.M. Buhl A.M. Duzic E. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3097-3104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) proposed recently that SP analogues act in a novel manner, stabilizing the active conformation of the bombesin/GRP receptor that interacts with G12 and proportionally reducing the receptor population that interacts with Gq. In the framework of this model, SP analogues would act as agonists for G12-mediated events and as antagonists for Gq-mediated events. It was further suggested that the inhibitory effect of broad spectrum SP antagonists on neuropeptide-stimulated cell proliferation could result, at least in part, from the disruption of the coordinated signaling that normally emanates from GPCRs. In support of this model, Jarpe et al.(43Jarpe M.B. Knall C. Mitchell F.M. Buhl A.M. Duzic E. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3097-3104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) demonstrated that [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]SP, a less potent analogue of [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP induced actin reorganization and assembly of focal adhesions. Our previous results, however, lead us to conclude that [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP coordinately inhibits signal transduction pathways activated by bombesin and other neuropeptides, but focal adhesion assembly and actin remodeling were not evaluated (20Seckl M.J.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 51-54PubMed Google Scholar).The experiments presented here were designed to examine the mechanism of action of [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP as an inhibitor of neuropeptide-mediated signal transduction and cellular DNA synthesis. Specifically, we examined whether this synthetic peptide antagonist, at concentrations that selectively inhibit neuropeptide-induced DNA synthesis and ERK activation, acts as an agonist of G12-mediated events including assembly of focal adhesions, formation of stress fibers, and tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion proteins FAK, p130Cas, and paxillin. On the basis of the results presented here, we conclude that [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP acts as a mitogenic antagonist of neuropeptide GPCRs blocking signal transduction via both Gq and G12.DISCUSSIONSP analogues including [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]SP and [Arg6,d-Trp7,9,MePhe8]SP (6Hellmich M.R.

These synthetic peptides also inhibit the proliferation of human cancer cells both in vitro and in nude mice and have entered in phase I clinical trials. Consequently, the mechanism of action of these agents is attracting considerable interest.Jarpe and collaborators (43Jarpe M.B. Knall C. Mitchell F.M. Buhl A.M. Duzic E. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Specifically, we examined whether [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP, used at a concentration that inhibits neuropeptide-induced DNA synthesis, ERK activation, and PKC-dependent PKD activation, acts as a selective agonist of G12-mediated events.It is well established that GPCR-induced increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin, and p130Cas are downstream of Rho activation, stress fiber formation, and focal adhesion assembly (64Seufferlein T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activated Gα12 and Gα13 stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin, and p130Cas via Rho (16Needham L.K. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14626-14632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate the existence of a signal transduction pathway whereby agonist occupation of GPCRs activates Gα12 and/or Gα13 leading to Rho-dependent formation of actin stress fibers and assembly of focal adhesions resulting in the recruitment of FAK to focal adhesions and in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin, and p130Cas. In order to elucidate whether [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP promotes the selective activation of this pathway, we examined in the present study the effects of [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP on the assembly of focal adhesions, the formation of actin stress fibers, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin, and p130Cas.Our results demonstrate that pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with 10 μm[d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP, a concentration that markedly inhibited neuropeptide-mediated Gq signaling and DNA synthesis, did not induce a significant increase in the formation of either focal adhesions or stress fibers. In contrast, pretreatment with [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP strikingly prevented the assembly of focal adhesions and the increase in actin stress fibers induced by bombesin. Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that treatment with [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP neither induced a significant increase in the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK nor induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397, the major autophosphorylation site in this enzyme. Accordingly, exposure to [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP did not promote Src·FAK complex formation. Similarly, [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin or p130Cas. A salient feature of the results presented here is that treatment with [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP dramatically inhibited the increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of these focal adhesion proteins induced by bombesin. Thus, [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP, at a concentration that inhibits Gq signaling and mitogenesis by neuropeptides, also prevents G12-mediated events including focal adhesion assembly, stress fiber formation, and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins.Jarpe et al. (43Jarpe M.B. Knall C. Mitchell F.M. Buhl A.M. Duzic E. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3097-3104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) demonstrated that [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]SP, a less potent analogue of [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP, induced actin reorganization and focal adhesion assembly at concentrations higher than that used in the present study. A possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between our results obtained with [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP and those with [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]SP is that a single amino acid change at position 5 fromd-Phe5 tod-Trp5 is responsible for the drastic change in the properties of these antagonists. However, Jarpe et al.(43Jarpe M.B. Knall C. Mitchell F.M. Buhl A.M. Duzic E. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3097-3104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) did not examine the possibility that [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]SP, at a lower concentration, could also inhibit G12-mediated events, as shown here with [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP. In the present study, we show that [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]SP (at 20 μm) markedly inhibited bombesin-induced assembly of focal adhesions and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin. Furthermore, we could also demonstrate that exposure of Swiss 3T3 cells to 50 μm[d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP promoted cytoskeletal rearrangements, formation of some focal adhesions, and a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion-associated proteins. These effects were much less prominent than those induced by bombesin in parallel cultures, and even at these concentrations, the SP analogue markedly reduced the assembly of focal adhesions and the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins induced by bombesin.[d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP, at high concentrations, may act as a low affinity partial agonist of an as yet unidentified GPCR expressed in Swiss 3T3 cells stabilizing an intermediate receptor conformation as suggested by the sequential binding model proposed by Gether and Kobilka (42Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). This sequential binding model takes into account structural and kinetic studies that are not readily accommodated by the conformational selection model. Alternatively, [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP could induce cellular effects via non-receptor pathways since SP analogues are known to insert into lipid membranes (71Seckl M.J. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Rozengurt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and these charged and lypophilic peptides can directly modulate G protein activity (72MacKinnon A.C. Armstrong R.A. Waters C.M. Cummings J. Smyth J.F. Haslett C. Sethi T. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1026-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).In conclusion, [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP acts as a broad spectrum mitogenic antagonist of neuropeptide GPCRs blocking signal transduction via both Gq and G12. However, at higher concentrations, this synthetic peptide induces additional effects that lead to a low level of focal adhesions and a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion-associated proteins. These findings are not compatible with the hypothesis that [d-Arg1,d-Trp5,7,9,Leu11]SP stabilizes a bombesin receptor conformation that interacts selectively with G12 but indicate that this SP analogue inhibits bombesin signaling mediated by both Gq and G12. Neuropeptides stimulate DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in cultured cells and are implicated as growth factors in a variety of fundamental processes including development, inflammation, tissue regeneration, and neoplastic transformation (1Rozengurt E.

https://openalex.org/W2080297181,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) binds to the extracellular N-terminal domain, exodomain, of its receptor, and the resulting hCG-exodomain complex is thought to modulate the membrane associated domain, endodomain, of the receptor to generate hormone signal. The bulk of the exodomain is speculated to assume a crescent structure consisting of eight to nine Leu-rich repeats (LRRs), which may provide the hormone contact sites. Unfortunately, little experimental evidence is available for the precise hormone contact points in the exodomain and the endodomain. The two preceding articles (Song, Y., Ji, I., Beauchamp, J., Isaacs, N., and Ji, T. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3426–3435; Song, Y., Ji, I., Beauchamp, J., Isaacs, N., and Ji, T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3436–3442) show that putative LRR2 and LRR4 are crucial for hormone binding. In particular, the N-terminal region of LRR4 assumes the hydrophobic core of the LRR4 loop, whereas the C-terminal region is crucial for signal generation. However, it is unclear whether LRR4 interacts hCG and the endodomain and how it might be involved in signal generation. In this article, our affinity labeling results present the first evidence that the N-terminal region of LRR4 interacts with hCG, preferentially the hCGα subunit and that the hCG/LRR4 complex interacts with exoloop 2 of the endodomain. This interaction offers a mechanism to generate hormone signal. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) binds to the extracellular N-terminal domain, exodomain, of its receptor, and the resulting hCG-exodomain complex is thought to modulate the membrane associated domain, endodomain, of the receptor to generate hormone signal. The bulk of the exodomain is speculated to assume a crescent structure consisting of eight to nine Leu-rich repeats (LRRs), which may provide the hormone contact sites. Unfortunately, little experimental evidence is available for the precise hormone contact points in the exodomain and the endodomain. The two preceding articles (Song, Y., Ji, I., Beauchamp, J., Isaacs, N., and Ji, T. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3426–3435; Song, Y., Ji, I., Beauchamp, J., Isaacs, N., and Ji, T. (2001) J. Biol.

These Leu/Ile-rich repeats (LRRs) represent a common structural motif found in a large family of proteins, which includes glycoprotein hormone receptors (11Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of ribonuclease inhibitors, the LRRs assume the horseshoe structure in which individual LRRs form a loop consisting of a β strand connected to parallel α helices. The β strands in ribonuclease inhibitors are involved in the interaction with ribonuclease. However, it is unclear whether the putative LRR sequences of LHR and other glycoprotein hormone receptors are indeed LRRs and function as such. In the preceding articles (12Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3436-3442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we have shown that some, but not all, LRRs of LHR and the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor are crucial for hormone binding. In particular, LRR2 and LRR4 of LHR are most crucial, but it is unclear whether these LRRs make direct contacts with the hormone. In this article, the evidence is presented for the interaction of the residues around the Leu-Ser-Ile motif, the putative β strand, in LRR4 with hCG, in particular with the hCGα subunit. In addition, our data suggest the interaction of the LRR4-hCG complex with the endodomain, in particular exoloop 2, which is likely to modulate signal generation. The N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester of 4-azidobenzoic acid (AB) was synthesized as described previously (14Ji I. Ji T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7167-7170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide esters of ethylene glycolbis(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate) (SES) were purchased from Pierce. The hCG CR 127 and hCG subunits were supplied by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. Denatured hCG was prepared by boiling hCG in 8 m urea for 30 min. Receptor peptides were synthesized and N-acetylated and C-amidated by Biosynthesis (Lewisville, TX). They were purified on a Vydac C18 high performance liquid chromatography column using a solvent gradient from 100% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 20% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 80% 1-propanol. The peptide mimics include the wild type receptor peptide corresponding to the LHR sequence of Asn96–Asp115 (LHR96–115), a mutant LHR96–115 with Leu103Ala and Ile105Ala mutations (LHR96–115(L103A/I105A), a mutant LHR96–115 with the Lys101 → Ala mutation (LHR96–115(K101A)), a mutant LHR96–115 with the Lys112 → Ala mutation (LHR96–115(K112A)), a wild type peptide encompassing the sequence upstream of LHR96–115 (LHR85–104), and a wild type peptide covering the sequence downstream of LHR96–115 (LHR113–132). NHS-AB was freshly dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a concentration of 50 mm in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) to a concentration of 20 mm. This reagent solution was immediately used to derivatize receptor peptides. In the dark, 10 μl of NHS-AB was added to 30 μg of LHR96–115 in 40 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). The mixture was incubated for 30 min for NHS-AB or 60 min for NHS-AB at 25 °C. The following were added to the derivatization mixture: 1 mCi of Na125I in 10 μl of 0.1 m NaOH and 7 μl of chloramine T (1 mg/ml) in 10 mm Na2HPO4 and 0.9% NaCl (pH 7.4) (PBS). After 20 s, 7 μl of sodium metabisulfite (2.5 mg/ml) in PBS was introduced to terminate radioiodination. Derivatized and radioiodinated AB-125I-LHR96–115 solution was mixed with 60 μl of 16% sucrose solution in PBS and fractionated on Sephadex Superfine G-10 column (0.6 × 15 cm) using PBS. Disposable glass tubes were siliconized under dimethyldichlorosilane vapor overnight and autoclaved. In each siliconized tube, 20 μl of PBS, hCG (70 ng in 10 μl PBS), and125I-LHR96–115 (100 ng in 10 μl of PBS) were mixed and incubated in 37 °C for 90 min. After incubation, 3 μl of 0.1 mm of SES in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each tube and further incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by adding 3 μl of 5 mm Gly in PBS. The samples were boiled for 2 min in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 8 m urea. The solubilized samples were electrophoresed on 8–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Gels were dried on filter paper, which was exposed to a molecular imaging screen (Bio-Rad) overnight. The imaging screen was scanned on a model GS-525 Molecular Imager System Scanner (Bio-Rad), and radioactive band intensity was analyzed using Image Analysis Systems, Version 2.1 (Bio-Rad). Gels were exposed to X-Omat x-ray film at −75 °C for ∼4 days. The following solutions were sequentially introduced to siliconized glass tubes: 20 μl of PBS, 10 μl of hCG (10 ng/μl) in PBS, and 10 μl of AB-125I-LHR96–115 (10 ng/μl) in PBS. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min in the dark, irradiated with a Mineralight R-52 UV lamp for 3 min as described previously (14Ji I. Ji T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7167-7170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and solubilized in 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 8m urea. The samples were electrophoresed on 8–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Gels were dried on filter paper and processed as described above. Competitive inhibition experiments were carried out as described for the affinity cross-linking and photoaffinity labeling experiments, except that 10 μl instead of 20 μl of PBS was introduced to each tube, and the mixture was incubated with 10 μl of increasing concentrations of nonradioactive wild type or mutant LHR96–115. A human embryonic kidney 293 cell line stably expressing human LHR was incubated with 100,000 cpm of 125I-hCG in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonradioactive wild type or mutant LHR96–115 peptides as described previously (15Ryu K.-S. Gilchrist R.L. Ji I. Kim S.-J. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7301-7304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After several times washing the cells, the radioactivity associated with the cells was counted, and percent bound 125I-hCG was plotted against the nonradioactive receptor peptides. The results were converted to Scatchard plot by plotting bound/free peptideversus bound peptide. The plot was used to calculate theK d value following the Scatchard equation (16Levitzki A. Receptors: Quantitative Approach. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Menlo Park, CA1984: 19-26Google Scholar). In the preceding articles (12Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3436-3442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we showed the crucial roles of LRRs of LHR in hormone binding, particularly LRR4. This raises the question as to whether the LRRs directly interact with the hormone or indirectly influence the hormone/receptor interaction by impacting the global structure of the receptor exodomain. To examine these possibilities a peptide mimic corresponding to the receptor sequence encompassing the β-stranded Leu103–Ile105, LHR96–115, was synthesized and tested for its ability to bind and affinity label hCG. For affinity labeling, we employed two complementary affinity labeling methods. In the first approach,125I-LHR96–115 incubated with hCG, and the resulting 125I-LHR96–115-hCG complexes were cross-linked using SES, a homobifunctional reagent that is capable of cross-linking two amino groups up to 13 Å apart (17Ji T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 91: 580-609Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the second approach, 125I-LHR96–115 was derivatized with AB, an UV-activable reagent, to produce AB-125I-LHR96–115 and incubated with hCG. The resulting 125I-LHR96–115-hCG complex was irradiated with UV to photoaffinity label hCG with AB-125I-LHR96–115. The advantages and disadvantages of both methods will be discussed later. To determine whether AB-125I-LHR96–115 and125I-LHR96–115 would bind and label hCG, they were incubated with hCG and treated with UV or SES, respectively. The samples were solubilized in SDS under the reducing condition and electrophoresed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The autoradiographic phosphoimage of the gel shows that both AB-125I-LHR96–115 and125I-LHR96–115 labeled both the α and β subunits in hCG (Fig. 1). In addition, the hCG αβ dimer was cross-linked and labeled with125I-LHR96–115 when the125I-LHR96–115-hCG complex was treated with SES. The positions of hCGα, hCGβ, and the hCGαβ dimer were determined by comparing the respective positions of125I-hCGα, 125I-hCGβ, and the cross-linked125I-hCG αβ dimer on the autoradiograph (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 5). As a first step to determine the specificity of affinity labeling, 125I-LHR96–115 was incubated with hCG and treated with increasing concentrations of SES. Electrophoresis of the treated hCG/125I-LHR96–115 mixture (Fig. 2 A) shows that125I-LHR96–115 was cross-linked to hCGα, hCGβ, and the hCGαβ dimer. The extent of cross-linking was dependent on the SES concentration, reaching the maximum level at 0.3–1 mm SES. Under this condition, ∼20% of125I-LHR96–115 was cross-linked to hCGα and ∼10% to hCGβ. At higher SES concentrations, for example 10 mm, the extent of cross-linking decreased. This decrease was due to noncross-linking, monofunctional reactions (only one of the two NHS groups reacting with a target amino group while the other NHS group undergoing hydrolysis) of excess SES with125I-LHR96–115, hCG, and its subunits (18Ji T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 39-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results indicate that125I-LHR96–115 was covalently cross-linked to hCGα and hCGβ. Furthermore, either or both amino groups of Lys101 and Lys112 of125I-LHR96–115, the only amino groups of the peptide, were cross-linked to an amino group(s) of either hCGα or hCGβ. The distance between the pair of two cross-linked amino groups is expected to be <13 Å. To determine whether the cross-links are specific between the receptor peptide and hCG, cross-linking was performed under increasing concentrations of 125I-LHR96–115while maintaining hCG at a constant concentration (Fig. 2 B). Conversely, 125I-LHR96–115 and hCG were cross-linked at increasing concentrations of hCG and a constant concentration of 125I-LHR96–115 (Fig.2 C). If cross-links are specific, they should reach saturation under both conditions. The results indeed show plateaus under both conditions, an indication of saturable and specific cross-linking. This specific cross-linking is not expected to occur with peptides that do not recognize hCG. Despite the indication for saturable and specific cross-links between the receptor peptide and hCG, there were a series of minor cross-linked complexes larger than the complex of 125I-LHR96–115 and the hCG dimer. They suggest that a minor population of the125I-LHR96–115-hCG dimer complex may be further cross-linked to another hCG subunit or hCG dimer. Although this is not entirely unexpected, as random collisional cross-links are possible (18Ji T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 39-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), it raises a concern on the specificity of homobifunctional cross-links between125I-LHR96–115 and hCG. A simple way to reduce or eliminate such random collisional cross-links is photoaffinity labeling (18Ji T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 39-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To photoaffinity label hCG with125I-LHR96–115, the receptor peptide was derivatized with AB to produce AB-125I-LHR96–115. When the derivatized peptide binds to hCG and is irradiated with UV, the cross-link will be restricted between 125I-LHR96–115 and hCGα or between 125I-LHR96–115 and hCGβ. The reagent, however, will not be able to cross-link an hCG subunit to another. AB can reach and label target molecules up to 7 Å (19Ji I. Ji T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The distance is considerably shorter than the maximum cross-linkable 13 Å of SES and therefore, the labeling reaction by AB is more restricted than the cross-linking reaction by SES. On the other hand, cross-linking with SES can be useful when AB attached at the contact point might interfere with the interaction. As shown in Fig. 2, D–F, AB-125I-LHR96–115 was capable of photoaffinity labeling either hCGα or hCGβ but not both subunits at the same time. The labeling is generally confined to hCGα with the labeling of hCGβ being faint. This result is consistent with the SES cross-linking results. One possible explanation is that the peptide is bound closer to α than β. The labeling required UV irradiation and was dependent on the irradiation time, reaching the maximum labeling after 30∼60-s irradiation. This UV dependence clearly indicates photoaffinity labeling. In addition, the preferential labeling of hCGα without simultaneously labeling of both subunits suggests a labeling specificity. To further examine the specificity of photoaffinity labeling, the concentration of either hCG or the peptide derivatives was changed. When a constant concentration of AB-125I-LHR96–115 was incubated with increasing concentrations of hCG, the intensity of labeled hCGα and β bands gradually increased and plateaued (Fig. 2 E). A similar result was obtained in a converse experiment when a constant amount of hCG was incubated with increasing concentrations of AB-125I-LHR96–115 (Fig. 2 F). These results indicate that the photoaffinity labeling is dependent on both the derivatized peptides and hCG as they are limiting factors. In both cases, the derivatized peptides labeled hCGα more than hCGβ, an indication of a labeling specificity. Specific labeling should be displaced by wild type peptide but not by a peptide that could not bind hCG. We have shown in the previous reports (12Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), (13Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3436-3442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that the Leu103→ Ala or Ile105 → Ala substitution in LHR abrogated hormone binding. Therefore, Leu103 and Ile105were substituted with Ala in LHR96–115 to produce a mutant peptide, LHR96–115(L103A/I105A). To test whether the wild type and mutant LHR peptides could inhibit affinity labeling, hCG was incubated with AB-125I-LHR96–115 in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonderivatized wild type peptide (Fig.3 A) and nonderivatized mutant peptide (Fig. 3 C). Increasing concentrations of LHR96–115 inhibited photoaffinity labeling in a dose-dependent manner and eventually, completely blocked it. These results indicate the specificity of LHR96–115for the photoaffinity labeling. In contrast, the inhibition by mutant LHR96–115(L103A/I105A) was significantly less effective (Fig. 3 C). Similar results were obtained with affinity cross-linking of 125I-LHR96–115 to hCG (Fig.3, B, D, and F). Although these results indicate the labeling specificity of AB-125I-LHR96–115 and125I-LHR96–115, the futile inhibition could be interpreted as the mutant peptide binding to a site in hCG different from the AB-125I-LHR96–115binding site. To test this hypothesis and test whether the mutant peptide could label hCG, LHR96–115(L103A/I105A) was radioiodinated or derivatized and then radioiodinated to prepare125I-LHR96–115(L103A/I105A) or AB-125I-LHR96–115(L103A/I105A), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, AB-125I-LHR96–115(L103A/I105A) and125I-LHR96–115(L103A/I105A) labeled the hCG subunits significantly less. Only trace amounts of labeling were detected, indicating the labeling affinities were significantly low. These results are consistent with the observation that the highest concentrations of nonderivatized LHR96–115(L103A/I105A)slightly attenuated the labeling by AB-125I-LHR96–115 and125I-LHR96–115.Figure 4Futile affinity labeling of hCG by mutant LHR 96–115. hCG was incubated with mutant AB-125I-LHR96–115(L103A/I105A) (lanes 3 and 4) or125I-LHR96–115(L103A/I105A) (lanes 7 and 8) and treated with UV for 1 min (lane 4) or 0.3 mm SES (lane 8), respectively. These samples were processed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The autoradiograph shows no affinity labeling of hCG as compared with successful labeling of hCG by wild type LHR96–115(lanes 2 and 6). Lanes 1 and5 show the control hCG samples that were incubated with the wild type peptide but without UV or SES treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the affinity labeling is specific, our data do not show the biological significance of the affinity labeling. To test this concern, two different experiments were performed. In the first test, denatured hCG was tested for affinity labeling, and in the second the peptides were examined whether they could inhibit 125I-hCG binding to the receptor on intact cells. For the first test, denatured hCG was incubated with increasing concentrations of AB-125I-LHR96–115or125I-LHR96–115 and treated with UV or SES, respectively (Fig. 5). Denatured hCG was not labeled at all by either of the LHR peptide derivatives, despite high concentrations of the peptide probes. The results suggest the specificity of the affinity labeling for biologically active hCG. Since SES failed to cross-link 125I-LHR96–115 to denatured hCG, 125I-LHR96–115appears to have a difficulty to recognize denatured hCG. To test this possibility, 125I-hCG was incubated with intact cells expressing LHR in the presence of increasing concentrations of the wild type or mutant peptide, LHR96–115 or LHR96–115(L103A/I105A) (Fig.6). The wild type LHR96–115inhibited 125I-hCG binding to the receptor with aK d value of 43.4 μm, suggesting its binding to the receptor with a reasonable affinity for a peptide (20Phang T. Kundu G. Hong S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13841-13847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,21Roche P.C. Ryan R.J. McCormick D.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, the K d value of mutant LHR96–115(L103A/I105A) was 5 mm, which is insignificant. This result, taken together with the futile labeling of denatured hCG (Fig. 5), shows the biological specificity of the binding and labeling of LHR96–115 to hCG. Furthermore, the results show that the interaction between hCG and LHR96–115simulates the interaction between hCG and the receptor.Figure 6Inhibition of 125I-hCG binding to the receptor by LHR peptides. 125I-hCG was incubated with intact 293 cells expressing LHR in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled wild type and mutant LHR96–115peptides. After washing cells several times to remove unbound125I-hCG, cells were counted for the bound125I-hCG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results were plotted against the concentrations of unlabeled peptides (left panel) and converted to Scatchard plots (right panel). The K d values of individual peptides in the table were determined with standard deviations based on the bound/free and bound peptide values as described previously (16Levitzki A. Receptors: Quantitative Approach. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Menlo Park, CA1984: 19-26Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LHR96–115 has two Lys residues, Lys101 and Lys112, which are derivatized with AB or reacted with SES. Since these two Lys are 11 amino acids apart and located in the opposite side of the LRR4 (Fig.7), it is important to know whether both or only one of them is involved in the affinity labeling. The information will be crucial for defining the orientation and hormone interacting phase of LRR4. To determine the labeling activity of the two Lys residues, one of them was substituted with Ala in LHR96–115 to produce LHR96–115(K101A) and LHR96–115(K112A). These two peptides were capable of inhibiting 125I-hCG binding to the receptor on intact cells, but their K d values were 12–15-fold higher than the corresponding K d value of the wild type LHR96–115 (Fig. 6). The result is consistent with the effect of Ala substitution for Lys101 or Lys112in intact receptor on hCG binding. The K d value for hCG binding of LHR increased by 2.6–3.4-fold when Lys101or Lys112 was substituted with Ala (13Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3436-3442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since they were capable of binding hCG, we examined whether the two mutant peptides were also capable of inhibiting photoaffinity labeling of hCG by AB-125I-LHR96–115 and affinity cross-linking of 125I-LHR96–115 to hCG (Fig.8). The results show their ability to inhibit the labeling, but the potency was noticeably less than the inhibition potency of the wild type peptide. Again, this result is consistent with the lower affinity of the two mutant peptides to hCG as compared with the affinity of the wild type peptide to hCG. All of these results show their specific interaction with hCG. Finally, we attempted to photoaffinity label hCG with AB-125I-LHR96–115(K101A) and AB-125I-LHR96–115(K112A) (Fig.9). AB-125I-LHR96–115(K112A) photoaffinity labeled hCG similar to the photoaffinity labeling of hCG by AB-125I-LHR96–115, whereas the labeling of hCG with AB-125I-LHR96–115(K101A) was less (Fig. 9 A). This result indicates that the photoaffinity labeling is significantly more effective when AB is attached to Lys101 than to Lys112.Figure 8Inhibition of affinity labeling by Lys to Ala mutant peptides. hCG was affinity-labeled with AB-125I-LHR96–115 and125I-LHR96–115 in the presence of increasing concentrations of LHR96–115(K101A) or LHR96–115(K112A) as described in the legend to Fig. 3. After processing the samples, the phosphoimage of the gel was analyzed to determine the percent labeling the hCG subunits. The results were plotted against the concentration of peptides for the inhibition of photoaffinity labeling hCGα (A) and hCGβ (B) and affinity cross-linking to hCGα (C) and hCGβ (D). In addition, the inhibition of unlabeled wild type LHR96–115 was presented for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Affinity labeling of hCG with Lys to Ala mutant peptides. A, hCG was photoaffinity-labeled with AB-125I-LHR96–115, AB-125I-LHR96–115(K101A), or AB-125I-LHR96–115(K101A) as described in the legend to Fig. 3. B, likewise, hCG was affinity-cross-linked to 125I-LHR96–115,125I-LHR96–115(K101A), or215I-LHR96–115(K101A) as described in the legend to Fig. 3. “+” and “−” indicate the treatment with or without UV or SES.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If this is true, one would expect the same trend with affinity cross-linking using the two peptides. Indeed,125ILHR96–115(K112A) was cross-linked to hCG with SES significantly better than125I-LHR96–115(K101A) (Fig. 9 B). However, neither of the derivatized peptides labeled denatured hCG, indicating a specificity of affinity labeling of hCG by AB-125I-LHR96–115(K112A) and125I-LHR96–115(K112A) (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that Lys101 is more suitable for affinity labeling hCG than Lys112 is. They also suggest that Lys101 is at or near the hCG contact point as suggested by the computer model that the short β strand is a ligand contact site, and the Lys101 is projected toward ligand (Fig. 7). In contrast, Lys112 is located near the α helix as part of the outer lining of the donut structure, at the opposite side from the ligand binding site. Since Lys101 is in the N-terminal area of LHR96–115, whereas Lys112 is in the C-terminal region, one way to verify the conclusion is to use peptide mimics covering the sequences upstream and downstream of LHR96–115. To this end, we synthesized two peptide mimics, LHR84–104 and LHR113–132, and tested them for their ability to inhibit photoaffinity labeling of hCG by AB-125I-LHR96–115 and affinity cross-linking of 125I-LHR96–115 to hCG (Fig.10). LHR84–104 and LHR113–132 inhibited the affinity labeling of hCG, but their potency was less than that of LHR96–115. LHR84–104 was more effective in inhibiting hCGα than LHR113–132 was. On the other hand, LHR85–104 was similar to LHR113–132 in inhibiting the labeling of hCGβ. In the preceding article (13Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3436-3442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we pointed out the absolute homology in the 8 residues (boldface) in theLeu 98-Pro-Gly-Leu-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Ser-Ile-Cys-Asn-Thr-Gly 109sequence among cloned LHR, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor of various species. Furthermore, we showed that the tandem three conserved residues,Asn 107-Thr-Gly 109, were more important for cAMP induction than hormone binding. This is unique because the exodomain is responsible of high affinity hormone binding and mutations in the exodomain impact hormone binding, which in turn affected cAMP induction, not the other way around. Therefore, we have raised the possibility that this region may be involved in the interaction with the endodomain and, thus, in signal generation. This is a crucial issue, because the exodomain and endodomain are known to interact (22Ji T.H. Murdoch W.J. Ji I. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Ji T.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28953-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and this interaction regulates the generation of hormone signals (22Ji T.H. Murdoch W.J. Ji I. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), (23Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). However, the exact contact points in the exodomain and endodomain are unknown. Since the three exoloops in the endodomain are a logical candidate for the exodomain/endodomain interaction, we have synthesized peptide mimics for the exoloops 1, 2, and 3 of LHR (LHRexo1, LHRexo2, and LHRexo3) and tested whether they could inhibit the photoaffinity labeling of hCG by AB-125I-LHR96–115 (Fig.11). LHRexo2 effectively inhibited the photoaffinity labeling, whereas the inhibition by LHRexo1 was less. In contrast, LHRexo3 did not inhibit the labeling. These differential effects suggest the specificity of the inhibition. Our results show that AB-125I-LHR96–115photoaffinity labels hCG. Ample evidence is presented to support the specificity of the photoaffinity labeling under rigorous conditions. The labeling is saturable and dependent on the hCG concentration, derivatized 125I-LHR96–115 concentration, and UV activation. AB-125I-LHR96–115 photoaffinity labels bioactive hCG but not denatured hCG. This labeling is blocked by nonderivatized wild type LHR96–115 but not by nonderivatized mutant LHR96–115(L103A/I105A). The same Ala mutations in LHR abolish the hCG binding activity of LHR. Furthermore, AB-125I-LHR96–115(L103A/I105A)does not photoaffinity label bioactive hCG and denatured hCG. LHR96–115 inhibits 125IhCG binding to the receptor expressed on intact cells but LHR96–115(L103A/I105A) is not capable of inhibiting125I-hCG binding to the receptor. To avoid the potential interference of the photoactivable group on binding of AB-125I-LHR96–115 to the receptor and the subsequent labeling, 125I-LHR96–115 was affinity-cross-linked to hCG with SES. This affinity labeling is equally successful with similar specificity. Both subunits of hCG are labeled, indicating that the UV-activable group coupled to AB-125I-LHR96–115 can reach them. This is consistent with other studies (26Morbeck D.E. Roche P.C. Keutmann H.T. McCormick D.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 97: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Liu C. Roth K.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3309-3314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and not surprising, since the two subunits are closely intertwined in the crystal structure (29Lapthorn J.P. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 30Wu H. Lustbader J.W. Liu Y. Canfield R.E. Hendrickson W.A. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hCGα was preferentially labeled. Obviously, the reagent more readily reaches and labels the α subunit than the β subunit. Since the maximum labeling distances of AB is 7 Å (19Ji I. Ji T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), hCGα is likely to contact AB-125I-LHR96–115. Our results are inconsistent with the unlikely possibility that the peptide associates with hCG at sites other than the receptor contact site, impacts the global structure of hCG, and interferes with the hormone/receptor interaction. Since LHR96–115 inhibits hCG binding to the receptor, AB-125I-LHR96–115 interacts with hCG at or near a contact site of hCG and the LH/CG receptor. It is significant that only one of the hCGαβ subunits, but not both, is labeled, although two AB could be attached to the two Lys residues of LHR96–115. This suggests that only one of the Lys residues is close to hCG. Indeed, photoaffinity labeling using mutant peptides lacking one of the Lys residues shows that the AB coupled to Lys101 is capable of labeling hCG, whereas the AB attached to Lys112 is less effective. This is strong evidence to support the orientation of Lys101 and Lys112 in the LRR4 loop model (Fig. 7) and implicates the N-terminal region of LHR96–113, including the putative β strand of LRR4, in the interaction with hCG. The crystallization of Leu-rich repeats (11Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 31Kobe B. Deisenhofer J.

They comprise the bulk of the exodomain at its center and are computer-modeled to show a crescent structure. The inner surface of the crescent consists of β sheets of the repeats and is thought to be the ligand contact site (8Jiang X. Dreno M. Buckler D. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W. Tayar N.

However, little experimental evidence has been available to support these popular views. Our results of this and the preceding articles (12Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Song Y. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N. Ji T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3436-3442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) are the first experimental evidence supporting the LRR structure of LHR and the direct interaction of the LRR4 β strand with hCG. Our studies have laid the ground work to determine the contact residues of the receptor and the hormone. It has been known that LHR interacts hCG initially at the exodomain, and the exodomain-hCG complex impacts the endodomain. This secondary contact is thought to generate the hormone signals (22Ji T.H. Murdoch W.J. Ji I. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the exodomain and endodomain are intimately associated before and after hormone binding (24Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Ryu K. Gilchrist R.L. Tung C. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28953-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This association is crucial because it affects the hormone binding affinity and provides a mechanism for the signal generation (24Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Ryu K. Gilchrist R.L. Tung C. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

Unfortunately, there are few clues to the site of the interaction between the exodomain and endodomain except the recent reports implicating exoloops 2 and 3 (24Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3436-3442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) show the involvement of LRR4 in the signal generation, implicating exoloop 2 and, perhaps, exoloop 1 as contact points of the exodomain/hCG complex. In fact, our computer modeling shows that the exoloop 2 projects straight up from the connecting the transmembranes 4 and 5, like a hairpin, toward the exodomain. It will be interesting to see whether the hairpin structure of exoloop 2 interacts with the crescent LRR structure of the exodomain, in particular LRR4. Such an exodomain/endodomain interaction could provide a mechanism for the mutual modulation of the two distinct domains (24Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J.
