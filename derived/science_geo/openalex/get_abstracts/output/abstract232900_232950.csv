https://openalex.org/W2157980636,"Previous estimates of land-atmosphere interaction (the impact of soil moisture on precipitation) have been limited by a lack of observational data and by the model dependence of computational estimates. To counter the second limitation, a dozen climate-modeling groups have recently performed the same highly controlled numerical experiment as part of a coordinated comparison project. This allows a multimodel estimation of the regions on Earth where precipitation is affected by soil moisture anomalies during Northern Hemisphere summer. Potential benefits of this estimation may include improved seasonal rainfall forecasts."

Decamethyldizincocene, Zn 2 (η 5 -C 5 Me 5 ) 2 , an organometallic compound of Zn(I) formally derived from the dimetallic [Zn–Zn] 2+ unit, has been isolated from the low-temperature (–10°C) reaction of Zn(C 5 Me 5 ) 2 and Zn(C 2 H 5 ) 2 in diethyl ether. X-ray studies show that it contains two eclipsed Zn(η 5 -C 5 Me 5 ) fragments with a Zn–Zn distance (± standard deviation) of 2.305(±3) angstroms, indicative of a metal-metal bonding interaction."

Although an accepted hallmark of this response is eventual down-regulation of DC endocytic capacity, we show that TLR ligands first acutely stimulate antigen macropinocytosis, leading to enhanced presentation on class I and class II major histocompatibility complex molecules. Simultaneously, actin-rich podosomes disappear, which suggests a coordinated redeployment of actin to fuel endocytosis. These reciprocal changes are transient and require p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Thus, the DC actin cytoskeleton can be rapidly mobilized in response to innate immune stimuli to enhance antigen capture and presentation."

The resistance alleles carried by these migrants are now spreading across Africa at an alarming rate, signaling the end of affordable malaria treatment and presenting sub-Saharan Africa with a public health crisis."
https://openalex.org/W2089111937,"Primordial ovarian follicles in mice form when somatic cells surround individual oocytes. We show that lack of Nobox , an oocyte-specific homeobox gene, accelerates postnatal oocyte loss and abolishes the transition from primordial to growing follicles in mice. Follicles are replaced by fibrous tissue in female mice lacking Nobox in a manner similar to nonsyndromic ovarian failure in women. Genes preferentially expressed in oocytes, including Oct4 and Gdf9 , are down-regulated in Nobox –/– mice, whereas ubiquitous genes such as Bmp4, Kit , and Bax remain unaffected. Therefore, Nobox is critical for specifying an oocyte-restricted gene expression pattern essential for postnatal follicle development."
https://openalex.org/W2046467293,"We demonstrate that the cell wall of living Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) exhibits local temperature-dependent nanomechanical motion at characteristic frequencies. The periodic motions in the range of 0.8 to 1.6 kHz with amplitudes of ∼3 nm were measured using the cantilever of an atomic force microscope (AFM). Exposure of the cells to a metabolic inhibitor causes the periodic motion to cease. From the strong frequency dependence on temperature, we derive an activation energy of 58 kJ/mol, which is consistent with the cell's metabolism involving molecular motors such as kinesin, dynein, and myosin. The magnitude of the forces observed (∼10 nN) suggests concerted nanomechanical activity is operative in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1974237962,"Intracellular acidification of skeletal muscles is commonly thought to contribute to muscle fatigue. However, intracellular acidosis also acts to preserve muscle excitability when muscles become depolarized, which occurs with working muscles. Here, we show that this process may be mediated by decreased chloride permeability, which enables action potentials to still be propagated along the internal network of tubules in a muscle fiber (the T system) despite muscle depolarization. These results implicate chloride ion channels in muscle function and emphasize that intracellular acidosis of muscle has protective effects during muscle fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W2022001982,"Stainless steels undergo a sharp rise in pitting corrosion rate as the potential, solution concentration, or temperature is changed only slightly. We report experiments using real-time microscopic in situ visualizations that resolve the nucleation and evolution of individual pits during the transition. They suggest that the sudden onset of corrosion is explained by an explosive autocatalytic growth in the number of metastable pits and that stabilization of individual pits takes place only later. This finding agrees with a theoretical approach treating the onset of pitting corrosion as a cooperative critical phenomenon resulting from interactions among metastable pits, and it extends perspectives on the control and prevention of corrosion onset."
https://openalex.org/W2157066013,"The eukaryotic copper,zinc superoxide dismutases are remarkably stable dimeric proteins that maintain an intrasubunit disulfide bond in the reducing environment of the cytosol and are active under a variety of stringent denaturing conditions. The structural interplay of conserved disulfide bond and metal-site occupancy in human copper,zinc superoxide dismutase (hSOD1) is of increasing interest as these post-translational modifications are known to dramatically alter the catalytic chemistry, the subcellular localization, and the susceptibility of the protein to aggregation. Using biophysical methods, we find no significant change in the gross secondary or tertiary structure of the demetallated form upon reduction of the disulfide. Interestingly, reduction does lead to a dramatic change in the quaternary structure, decreasing the monomer-to-dimer equilibrium constant by at least four orders of magnitude. This reduced form of hSOD1 is monomeric, even at concentrations well above the physiological range. Either the addition of Zn(II) or the formation of the disulfide leads to a shift in equilibrium that favors the dimeric species, even at low protein concentrations (i.e. micromolar range). We conclude that only the most immature form of hSOD1, i.e. one without any post-translational modifications, favors the monomeric state under physiological conditions. This finding provides a basis for understanding the selectivity of mitochondrial SOD1 import and may be relevant to the toxic properties of mutant forms of hSOD1 that can cause the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SOD1 is one of the most thermally stable enzymes known in mesophilic organisms. Dismutase activity declines at 80 °C with a corresponding melting temperature, Tm, above 90 °C (2Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D.M. Valentine J.S. Marky L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The protein is stable in the presence of strong denaturants, and the activity is observed in 4% SDS or 10 m urea (3Forman H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structural properties of SOD1 that contribute to this extreme thermochemical stability are thought to include an eight-stranded β-barrel motif, hydrophobic interactions associated with dimerization, coordinate covalent bonds, and an intrasubunit disulfide bond between highly conserved pair of cysteines, namely Cys57 and Cys146 in the human form. Whereas the dimerization can contribute to the structural stability through the reduction of its mobility (4Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Rosato A. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9108-9118Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the roles of the disulfide bond in the SOD1 function and/or structure are only now beginning to emerge. Inspection of the SOD1 structure reveals that the loop containing Cys57 can influence the conformation of the catalytically important residue, Arg143, through a hydrogen-bonding network (5Fisher C.L. Cabelli D.E. Tainer J.A. Hallewell R.A. Getzoff E.D. Proteins. 1994; 19: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Portions of this loop contribute to the dimer interface (6Bertini I. Mangani S. Viezzoli M.S. Sykes A.G. Advanced Inorganic Chemistry. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 127-250Google Scholar), leading to the possibility that the disulfide bond influences the protein dimerization and thereby the SOD1 quaternary structure. To attain the correctly folded quaternary structure and become enzymatically active, several post-translational modifications need to occur in SOD1 such as the acquisition of copper and zinc ions, formation of the disulfide bond, and dimerization. Whereas the mechanism by which SOD1 acquires Zn(II) is not fully understood, several aspects of the copper insertion by the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS) are well established (7O'Halloran T.V.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More recently, Furukawa et al. (13Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) have shown that the intrasubunit disulfide bond is correctly introduced in yeast SOD1 by the copper-bound form of yeast CCS. However, given that the cytosol is a strongly reducing environment due to the high GSH/GSSG ratio (100:1–1000:1) (14Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar), the disulfide formation is an unfavorable process. Those results suggest that the immature disulfide-reduced hSOD1 is a more important species in the cytosolic environment than previously thought. Field et al. (15Field L.S. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28052-28059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) have also recently shown that uptake of the SOD1 molecule into the intermembrane space of the mitochondria is dependent on the status of the disulfide bond. The reduced form of SOD1 is imported through the mitochondrial outer membrane, but the disulfide-bonded apo-SOD1, the Zn(II)-loaded SOD1, and the holo-form or fully mature form of SOD1 are not readily transferred from the cytosol into the intermembrane space of the mitochondria. The effects of disulfide reduction on the SOD1 structure are therefore relevant to our understanding of the intracellular localization and stability of the SOD1 molecule. In this study we show that, even after removal of both copper and zinc ions from the active and mature form of hSOD1, the dimeric state still persists; however, upon reduction of the disulfide bond, the protein can readily dissociate to the monomer form. Zn(II) addition to the reduced apo-hSOD1 restores the dimeric state, indicating that only the most immature form of hSOD1 before any post-translational modifications favors the monomeric state. These results provide a molecular basis for understanding factors that control the SOD1 monomer-dimer equilibrum in the cytosol and have direct relevance to models for the toxic gain of function mutations in SOD1 that are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). Sample Preparation—hSOD1 was expressed in the Escherichia coli TOPP1 (Stratagene) or BL21(DE3) strain. The mutations were performed using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The 15N-labeled protein in which the non-conserved cysteine residues, Cys6 and Cys111, were mutated to Ser was obtained by growing the cells in the M9 minimal medium with N15-NH4Cl following a reported procedure (16Banci L. Benedetto M. Bertini I. Del Conte R. Piccioli M. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11780-11791Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas LB medium was used for the non-labeled protein. The cells were grown at 37 °C until A600 = 0.6 and induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h. The protein was isolated and purified according to previously published protocols (16Banci L. Benedetto M. Bertini I. Del Conte R. Piccioli M. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11780-11791Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fully reduced and demetallated hSOD1 (E,E-hSOD1SH) was prepared by treating the isolated protein with dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 1 h in an anaerobic chamber to reduce the disulfide bond (13Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The protein solution was then acidified using 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid, and organic solvents (15% CH3CN, 10% CH3OH) were included to remove the metal ions. The protein solution was purified using reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography through a 300-Å C18 Jupiter column (Phenomenex) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The fractions containing hSOD1 were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN and lyophilized. The metal content of E,E-hSOD1 was checked by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry using a Thermo Jarrell Ash Atomscan Model 25 Sequential inductively coupled spectrometer, and zinc and copper ions were <10 nm in the 2 μm protein sample. Zinc reconstitution was obtained as previously described (17Beem K.M. Rich W.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein reduction and metallation were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere in an anaerobic chamber. Thiol-Disulfide Reduction Assay—The thiol-disulfide status of purified hSOD1 was determined by chemical modification with the thiolspecific reagent 4-acetamide-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) (Molecular Probes, Inc.) (13Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). AMS conjugation results in a ∼1 kDa increase in the molecular mass of hSOD1 as visualized by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. 3 μg of the SOD1 protein that is dissolved in 10 μl of the buffer was mixed with 2.5 μl of 100 mm AMS and 2.5 μl of 10% SDS. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for an hour in an anaerobic chamber, and then the Laemmli buffer without any reducing agent was added. After boiling at 95 °C for 2 min, the sample was loaded on SDS-PAGE gel. CD Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD spectra (185–260 nm) of hSOD1 were recorded on JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. A cell with a path length of 1 mm was used for the measurement, and the parameters were set as follows: bandwidth, 2 nm; step resolution, 0.1 nm; scan speed, 50 nm/min; and response time: 2 s. Each spectrum was obtained as the average of five scans. The protein concentration was typically around 20 μm. Prior to the calculation of the mean residue molar ellipticity, all of the spectra were corrected by subtracting the contributions from the buffer. Spectra were then smoothed using adjacent averaging or Fast Fourier transform filter. Quantitative estimations of the secondary structure contents were made using the DICROPROT software package (18Deleage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—Data were collected on Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer, operating at a proton nominal frequency of 500.13 MHz. A triple resonance Cryoprobe equipped with pulsed field gradients along the z-axis was used. The two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra and relaxation experiments were acquired on 0.5 mm samples of 15N-labeled E,E- and E,Zn-hSOD1SH in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The 15N backbone longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates, R1 and R2, were measured as previously described (19Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9543-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The value of reorientational correlation time τm was estimated from the R2/R1 ratio with the program Quadric_diffusion (20Bruschweiler R. Liao X. Wright P.E. Science. 1995; 268: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). All of the spectra were collected at 298 K, processed using the standard Bruker software (XWINNMR). All of the NMR samples were prepared under nitrogen atmosphere in a glove box where they were loaded into 5-mm quartz NMR tubes capped with latex serum caps. Gel Filtration Chromatography—200 μlof30 μm hSOD1 protein was loaded on Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The column was preequilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. To prevent the possible air-oxidation of the thiol groups, 1 mm dithiothreitol was added in the above buffer for the gel filtration analysis of E,E- and E,Zn-hSOD1SH. For the experiments using E,E-hSOD1SH/SS, 0.1 mm EDTA was included in the buffer. The chromatogram was obtained by monitoring the absorbance at 215 nm. The calibration of the column for the estimation of molecular weight was performed using 200 μl of 0.25 g/liter immunoglobulin G, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, horse heart skeletal myoglobin, E. coli thioredoxin, and aprotinin as protein standards. Chemical reduction of the disulfide in hSOD1 with dithiothreitol followed by acidification to remove bound metal ions yields the fully reduced and demetallated E,E-hSOD1SH sample as confirmed by AMS modification and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry analysis. In the NMR and CD studies, two of the four Cys residues in hSOD1 have been mutated to Ser (i.e. C6S/C111S) to avoid the possible oxidation of the free thiol groups and it has been reported that these Cys residues, Cys6 and Cys111, which are not involved in disulfide formation, have little effects on the SOD1 activity and structure (21Parge H.E. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6109-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). When the disulfide bond is intact, previous studies have shown that SOD1 is mainly comprised of β sheets and has little α-helical structure (19Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9543-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To examine the possible structural changes upon disulfide reduction, CD spectroscopy was used to probe the secondary structure. Disulfide Reduction Has a Little Effect on the SOD1 Secondary Structure—As seen in Fig. 1, the CD spectrum of the most immature form, E,E-hSOD1SH, exhibits a negative peak at 207 nm, indicating that E,E-hSOD1SH is predominantly comprised of the β sheets (22Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3310) Google Scholar). The absence of a strong band at 222 nm in the spectrum indicates low α-helical content (22Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3310) Google Scholar). We attempted to see whether any major changes in the secondary structure upon the disulfide formation could be detected by using E,E-form of the monomeric hSOD1 mutant, E,E-Q133M2SOD1SS. However, both E,E-hSOD1SH and E,E-Q133M2SOD1SS give CD signals similar to that of the matured form of the enzyme, Cu,Zn-hSOD1SS (Fig. 1). The fitting of CD data (18Deleage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar) suggests that these forms of hSOD1 have similar secondary structure content as reported in Table I. Disulfide reduction does not significantly alter the secondary structure, suggesting that several features of the β barrel-folding pattern are acquired before any post-translational modifications. We also examined the effects of the disulfide reduction on the tertiary and quaternary structure of hSOD1 by NMR spectroscopy.Table ISecondary structure content of various forms of hSOD1 obtained from the fitting of far-UV CD spectra by the DICROPROT software package (18Deleage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar) using the least square method of Chen et al. (23Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H.

Although several signals are present in a spectral region typical of unfolded polypeptides (between 8 and 8.5 ppm in the 1H dimension), this spectrum is remarkably similar to that of E,E-Q133M2SOD1SS (Fig. 2B) for which the NMR signals have been assigned (19Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9543-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the tertiary structure of E,E-hSOD1SH also is similar to that of E,E-Q133M2SOD1SS, i.e. the β barrel structure is maintained, and loops IV (residues 45–85) and VII (residues 121–142) are severely disordered (19Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9543-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because loop IV contains three His ligands involved in Zn(II) binding and also involves a disulfide-bond residue, namely Cys57, it is likely that zinc removal and disulfide reduction can destabilize and increase the structural mobility of loop IV. Likewise, it has been reported that loop VII, which produces an optimal electrostatic field for uptake of the superoxide substrate, becomes well organized upon the zinc binding (19Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9543-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. D'Onofrio M. Viezzoli M.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2479-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, even after demetallation and reduction of the disulfide bond, most of the protein tertiary structure is retained with the exception of the disorder of some loop regions. However, when zinc ion is added to the E,E-hSOD1SH sample, a dramatic change in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum is observed (Fig. 2A, blue contours). Compared with the E,E state, E,Zn-hSOD1SH shows a larger signal dispersion in the spectrum, which resembles that of the matured protein, Cu,Zn-hSOD1SS (Fig. 2C). Monomeric E,Zn-Q133M2SOD1SS shows the intermediate features in the HSQC spectrum between monomeric E,E-hSOD1SH and dimeric Cu,Zn-hSOD1SS (see Supplemental Fig. S1). The 1H and 15N chemical shift differences between the three zinc-bound forms of the protein are shown in Fig. 3 as the weighted average chemical shift differences, Δavg(HN) (i.e.{[(ΔH)2 + (ΔN/5)2]/2}½, where ΔH and ΔN are chemical shift differences for 1H and 15N, respectively). Differences between E,Zn-hSOD1SH and E,Zn-Q133M2SOD1SS (Fig. 3A) are due to disulfide reduction and/or dimerization, differences between E,Zn-hSOD1SH and Cu,Zn-hSOD1SS (Fig. 3B) are due to disulfide reduction and/or copper binding, and differences between E,Zn-Q133M2SOD1SS and Cu,Zn-hSOD1SS (Fig. 3C) are due to dimerization and/or copper binding. In all of the cases, significant chemical shift differences are present in loops IV and VII, whereas those for the residues at the N- and C-terminal regions are relatively small. The disulfide formation/copper binding in the zinc-bound proteins affects loops IV and VII more significantly than the N- and C-terminal regions, which are at the dimer interface. Cross-peaks of some of these residues at the dimer interface, which are outside the crowded regions and well resolved in 1H-15N HSQC spectra, are indicated with arrows in Fig. 2, A–D. The overall correlation time for molecular reorientation (τm) provides insights into the hSOD1 quaternary structure. The τm values were estimated from the averaged values of 15N R1 and R2, which are obtained for 69 and 72 backbone NH resonances of E,E- and E,Zn-hSOD1SH, respectively (Table II). The overall correlation time is highly sensitive to the protein size (25Einstein A. Investigations on the Theory of the Brownian Movement. Dover, New York1956Google Scholar), and the dimerization is expected to increase τm. Estimated from the R2/R1 ratios, τm is significantly larger in E,Zn-hSOD1SH (20.6 ± 0.9 ns) than in E,E-hSOD1SH (10.3 ± 0.4 ns). In particular, the τm value of E,E-hSOD1SH is very similar to that of monomeric E,E-Q133M2SOD1SS (10.1 ns) (19Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9543-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and E,Zn-Q133M2SOD1SS (8.4 ± 0.3 ns) (24Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. D'Onofrio M. Viezzoli M.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2479-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas E,Zn-hSOD1SH exhibits a τm value similar to that found for dimeric Cu,Zn-hSOD1SS (25.3 ns) (4Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Rosato A. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9108-9118Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results suggest that E,E-hSOD1SH is monomeric and that Zn(II) addition to the reduced protein can lead to the dimerization. This result is quite surprising, because previous studies have shown that SOD1 dimer is very stable, even after complete demetallation (26Hartz J.W. Deutsch H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7043-7050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To directly examine the effects of the disulfide reduction on the monomer-dimer equilibrium at physiological concentrations of protein, we employed gel filtration chromatography.Table IIAverage 15N R1 and R2 values and the overall correlation time, τmAverage R1Average R2τms-1nsE,E-hSOD1SH1.79 ± 0.17aMeasured at 500 MHz.13.8 ± 2.0aMeasured at 500 MHz.10.3 ± 0.4E,Zn-hSOD1SH1.01 ± 0.10aMeasured at 500 MHz.29.2 ± 3.4aMeasured at 500 MHz.20.6 ± 0.9E,E-Q133M2SOD1SS1.24 ± 0.09bMeasured at 600 MHz.12.6 ± 2.7bMeasured at 600 MHz.10.1 ± 0.3cRef. 19.E,Zn-Q133M2SOD1SS1.36 ± 0.29bMeasured at 600 MHz.13.4 ± 0.9bMeasured at 600 MHz.8.4 ± 0.3dRef. 24.Cu,Zn-hSOD1SS0.60 ± 0.11bMeasured at 600 MHz.33.9 ± 4.1bMeasured at 600 MHz.25.3 ± 1.3eRef. 4.a Measured at 500 MHz.b Measured at 600 MHz.c Ref. 19Banci L.

Open table in a new tab Monomer-Dimer Equilibrium of E,E- and E,Zn-hSOD1SH/SS—Fig. 4A compares the gel filtration chromatograms between the wild-type E,E- and E,Zn-hSOD1SH proteins. The E,E-form of reduced hSOD1(WT) favors the monomeric state at the concentration of ∼30 μm (broken curve in Fig. 4A). The physiological concentration of SOD1 in the cell has been estimated to be ∼10 μm in yeast by quantitative Western blot (8Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) and ∼100 μm in the cytosol of cultured hepatocytes by quantitative immunocytochemistry (27Chang L.Y. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Crapo J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). After E,E-hSOD1SH(WT) is anaerobically incubated with an equimolar amount of zinc ion for an hour at 37 °C, the resultant protein, E,Zn-hSOD1SH(WT), strongly favors the dimeric state (solid curve in Fig. 4A). The preference for the monomeric state in E,E-hSOD1SH(WT) can be also confirmed by using a hSOD1 mutant in which all of the Cys residues are changed to Ser, C6S/C57S/C111S/C146S (i.e. the C4S form). The protein conformation of reduced hSOD1 can be modeled by this quadruple mutant, which cannot undergo any type of thiol oxidation. Consistent with the WT data, the E,E-form of this C4S mutant favors the monomeric state and turns to the dimeric state upon the addition of the zinc ion (Fig. 4B). To investigate the effects of the conserved disulfide bond (Cys57-Cys146) on monomer-dimer equilibrium, the non-conserved cysteine residues, Cys6 and Cys111, were mutated to Ser. As seen in the WT protein, the E,E-form of the C6S/C111S mutant favors the monomeric state when the disulfide bond is reduced and the addition of Zn ion can dimerize the protein (Fig. 4C). These results show that the monomer-dimer equilibrium is not affected by the non-conserved cysteine residues. In contrast, when the conserved Cys residues are oxidized to form the intramolecular disulfide bond, the E,E-hSOD1SS(C6S/C111S) form elutes at the peak position corresponding to the dimeric state (broken curve in Fig. 4D). This result suggests that, in the absence of any metal ions, the SOD1 monomerization is promoted by reduction of the canonical disulfide. The addition of Zn(II) ion to E,E-hSOD1SS(C6S/C111S) does not further change the elution profile, and E,Zn-hSOD1SS(C6S/C111S) still favors the dimeric state (solid curve in Fig. 4D). Therefore, Zn(II) removal alone cannot monomerize the hSOD1 protein unless the disulfide is reduced. We conclude that the nascent or folded form of the hSOD1 polypeptide favors the monomer state until it undergoes the first of several post-translational modifications in the cell. The subunits of copper,zinc superoxide dismutase are not linked by covalent bonds but are nonetheless unusually resistant to dissociation. Strong interaction is observed under extreme denaturing conditions such as 8–10 m urea, 7 m guanidine HCl, or SDS (3Forman H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is surprising that the E,E-hSOD1SH protein is monomeric, even without any detergents present. In fact, we find that the E,E-hSOD1SH form is dominantly monomeric even at the high concentrations (500 μm) used in the NMR experiments. When we assume that ∼10% total 500 μm E,E-hSOD1SH is in the dimeric state, the upper limit for the association constant is estimated as Ka < 2 × 102m–1. At the other extreme, E,E-hSOD1SS still favors the dimeric state, even at the low concentrations used (30 μm) in the gel filtration experiments. Based on a conservative estimate of the absorbance in the gel filtration, <10% of the total E,E-hSOD1SS exists as the monomer in this condition, leading to an estimate of the lower limit of Ka > 3 × 106m–1. Thus, although disulfide formation does not significantly change the secondary structure of hSOD1 (Fig. 1), it clearly favors dimerization by at least four orders of magnitude. The observations here show that the disulfide bond plays a quite significant but not clearly exclusive role in determining the quaternary structure of the human form of SOD1. Zinc acquisition by the E,E-hSOD1SH state seems to have as profound effect on the monomer-dimer equilibrium as disulfide formation, i.e. both E,E-hSOD1SS and E,Zn-hSOD1SH favor the dimeric state, even when protein concentration is as low as 10 μm. Zinc binding has been shown to reduce the mobility of the loop IV (residues 48–85, colored with purple in Fig. 5) (19Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9543-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. D'Onofrio M. Viezzoli M.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2479-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which contains the important amino acid residues for zinc ligation, i.e. His63, His71, and His80 (colored with green in Fig. 5). Because loop IV in SOD1 is adjacent to the interface between the subunits, such a structurization of loop IV upon the binding of the Zn ion is also implicated to play important roles in the SOD1 dimerization (19Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9543-9553Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. D'Onofrio M. Viezzoli M.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2479-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The results here show that, even when the disulfide is reduced, Zn(II) binding alone is enough to stabilize a conformation of the protein that favors dimer formation. Likewise, it is interesting to note that loop IV is linked to the β sheet unit via the disulfide formation between Cys57 and Cys146. Whereas a structural determination of several SOD1 microstates is currently in progress, reduction of the disulfide bond would release and disorder loop IV, resulting in the increase of its conformational flexibility. Such a disordered structure of loop IV may obstruct the interaction between the subunits. Therefore, both disulfide formation and Zn(II) binding can add structure to the protein conformation around loop IV, which would promote the interaction between the subunits. Important roles of the disulfide bond in the monomer-dimer equilibrium have also been reported in the yeast SOD1 (ySOD1) and are in accordance with this study on human SOD1. However, Furukawa et al. (13Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) have found that reduction of the disulfide in E,Zn-ySOD1SS (dimer) leads to conformation changes that favor the monomeric state under the same conditions. Thus, there is an interesting difference in the behavior of the yeast and human proteins. The E,Zn-form of reduced human protein favors the dimeric state, whereas the same state of the yeast protein favors the monomer state. Although the structural characterization of E,Zn-ySOD1SH and E,Zn-hSOD1SH is necessary, we speculate that this difference may be attributed to two proline residues, Pro142 and Pro144, near the intrasubunit disulfide bond that are present in the yeast but not in the human protein. Culotta and co-workers (28Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5964-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have recently shown that these residues play a key role in the CCS-independent activation pathways, which differ for the yeast and human enzyme. The trans-configuration of these proline residues would limit the ySOD1 conformation, especially around the disulfide bond and loop IV to reduce the interaction between the subunits. Given that the cytosol can provide the strongly reducing conditions (100–1000:1 of the GSH/GSSG ratio), the monomeric form of this disulfide-reduced SOD1 protein appears to be more physiologically relevant than has been appreciated to date. In the yeast system, the most immature form, i.e. E,E-ySOD1SH, is the only one that is efficiently taken up from the cytosol into the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Mitochondrial retention of SOD1 is dependent upon its activation by yeast CCS inside the intermembrane space of mitochondria (15Field L.S. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28052-28059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); however, once the Zn(II) ion is incorporated or the disulfide bond is introduced in E,E-ySOD1SH, mitochondrial import of the SOD1 protein is significantly inhibited (15Field L.S. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28052-28059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This selectivity for SOD1 mitochondrial import could be explained by our current results. The completely demetallated and disulfide-reduced form has a smaller size than any other forms. Furthermore, it is expected to be easier to unfold and thread its way through machinery in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Dimerization that accompanies metallation and disulfide formation may prevent the SOD1 dimer from crossing the mitochondrial membrane. Perturbation of the SOD1 quaternary structure by disulfide reduction may be relevant to the etiology of fALS, which has been associated with a number of mitochondrial pathologies in fALS patients (29Julien J.P. Cell. 2001; 104: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the human SOD1 can cause 20% of total fALS, which is a fatal and late-onset neurodegenerative disorder (30Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A. Iqbal Z. Cayabyab A. Hung W.Y.

The fALS-associated mutants do not necessarily lose the SOD1 activity but gain some new activities to cause the disease, such as peroxidase activity or adventitious protein aggregation (29Julien J.P. Cell. 2001; 104: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the apoform of the fALS mutant exhibits decreased stability, which has some correlations with disease duration (32Lindberg M.J. Tibell L. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16607-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that protein monomerization plays a role in formation of misfolded intermediates, leading to protein aggregation (33Rakhit R. Crow J.P. Lepock J.R. Kondejewski L.H. Cashman N.R. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15499-15504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Because the conserved disulfide bond in SOD1 is adjacent to the dimer interface (Fig. 4) (34Bordo D. Djinovic K. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 366-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we suspect that SOD1 monomerization can increase the exposure of these Cys residues. A thiol group in the Cys residue is in general susceptible to the oxidative modification, which plays an important role in the protein aggregation in some neurodegenerative disease (35Lee S. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that exposed Cys residues in the SOD1 monomer can be modified by oxidative stress, leading to disulfide-linked multimerization of SOD1 (13Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These SOD1 multimers could be involved in protein aggregation and the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Interestingly, increased susceptibility to disulfide reduction has been observed in some fALS mutants (36Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5984-5992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); therefore, protein monomerization caused by the disulfide reduction and demetallation might be an important process in causing the fALS diseases.

Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, is critical in the control of Na+ transport.

Recent work suggests that Nedd4-2 is negatively regulated by serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK), a Ser/Thr kinase. SGK binds to Nedd4-2 and phosphorylates it at three sites (see Fig. 3C), which reduces Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC (15Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol.

Peptides (15 amino acids) corresponding to Ser-221 (biotin-EPSSRLRSCSVTDAV), Thr-246 (biotin-APAGRARSSTVTGGE), and Ser-327 (biotin-PQIRRPRSLSSPTVT) were synthesized (Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Keck Facility, Yale University) as well as equivalent peptides in which Ser-221, Thr-246, and Ser-327 were mutated to alanine. Electrophysiology—Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells were cultured and transfected as previously described (15Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with or without cAMP agonists (200 μm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP sodium (Sigma), 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), and 10 μm forskolin (Sigma)) and LY294002 (50 μm, Promega) for 2 h before the study, as indicated in the figure legends. Na+ transport was measured using modified Ussing chambers (Warner Instrument Corp.). The apical and basolateral surfaces were bathed in 135 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm K2HPO4, 0.6 mm KH2PO4, 10mm HEPES (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Amiloride-sensitive short circuit current was determined as the difference in current with and without amiloride (100 μm) in the apical bathing solution. Nedd4-2 Phosphorylation—COS-7 cells were electroporated with Nedd4-2 cDNA, lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). Nedd4-2 was immunoprecipitated (from 500 μg of total protein) with anti-WW domain 1 antibody (1:50) (15Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and protein A beads (Pierce), then incubated with [32P]ATP (10 μCi) in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, 5 mm ATP, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) with or without 1 μg of PKA (Promega) at 32 °C for 20 min. After separation by SDS-PAGE, phosphorylated Nedd4-2 was detected by autoradiography. For back-phosphorylation, COS-7 cells were treated with cAMP agonists (200 μm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP sodium (Sigma), 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), and 10 μm forskolin (Sigma)) or 1 μm KT5720 (Calbiochem) for 2 h before lysis. Nedd4-2-HA was used for back-phosphorylation and Western blot. To detect phosphorylation of specific Nedd4-2 residues, wild-type and mutant peptides (10 μg) were immobilized on streptavidin-coated plates (Pierce) and incubated with [32P]ATP (20 μCi) in kinase buffer with or without 1.25 μg of PKA. Unincorporated 32P was removed by extensive washing, and incorporated 32P was detected by scintillation counting. Protein Interactions—Nedd4-2 was expressed in COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitated, and phosphorylated or not phosphorylated with PKA as described above (1 mm cold ATP was substituted for [32P]ATP), then incubated for 16 h with αENaC, βENaC, or γENaC (20 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro transcription/translation reaction (TNT, Promega)). The pellet was washed 4 times with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, separated by SDS-PAGE, and imaged by autoradiography. cAMP Inhibits Nedd4-2—We hypothesized that cAMP regulates epithelial Na+ transport in part by modulating the activity of Nedd4-2. To begin to test this hypothesis we asked if cAMP alters Nedd4-2 function. We cotransfected FRT epithelial cells with ENaC and Nedd4-2, then measured the resulting transepithelial Na+ current that was sensitive to amiloride, an ENaC blocker. Nedd4-2 reduced ENaC current in a dose-dependent manner; increasing amounts of Nedd4-2 cDNA resulted in progressively smaller ENaC currents (Fig. 1, A and B), consistent with our previous work (15Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with cAMP agonists produced a large shift to the right in the Nedd4-2 dose-response relationship, greatly reducing Nedd4-2 inhibition of ENaC (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, cAMP inhibits Nedd4-2. Nedd4-2 Contributes to ENaC Regulation by cAMP—As a further test of this hypothesis we asked if Nedd4-2 is required for cAMP to regulate ENaC. FRT epithelia express endogenous Nedd4-2 (17Snyder P.M. Steines J.C. Olson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5042-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and reconstitute cAMP regulation of ENaC (20Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our strategy was to decrease Nedd4-2 expression using RNA interference; in previous work, we generated siRNAs that selectively silence Nedd4-2 or Nedd4 (a related E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase) (17Snyder P.M. Steines J.C. Olson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5042-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Transfection of FRT epithelia with ENaC generated amiloride-sensitive Na+ current that was stimulated by cAMP agonists (Fig. 2A, top panel, and B) (20Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cotransfection with Nedd4-2 siRNA abolished ENaC stimulation by cAMP, but Nedd4 siRNA or GFP siRNA (Control) did not (Fig. 2, A and B). As a second strategy, we generated a dominant negative Nedd4-2 construct corresponding to the four WW domains; this construct prevented wild-type Nedd4-2 from inhibiting ENaC (Fig. 2C) because it retains the ability to bind to ENaC (via its WW domains) but lacks the catalytic ubiquitin ligase domain. Overexpression of the dominant negative Nedd4-2 in FRT epithelia abolished ENaC stimulation by cAMP (Fig. 2, A and B), similar to Nedd4-2 siRNA. Together, the data suggest that Nedd4-2 contributes to cAMP regulation of ENaC. PKA Phosphorylates Nedd4-2—We tested the hypothesis that cAMP inhibits Nedd4-2 via PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Nedd4-2. To determine whether it is a substrate for PKA, we incubated immunopurified Nedd4-2 in vitro with [32P]ATP. In the presence of PKA (but not in the absence), 32P was incorporated into Nedd4-2 (Fig. 3A), indicating that PKA phosphorylates Nedd4-2 in vitro. PKA has the potential to phosphorylate proteins in vitro that it does not phosphorylate in vivo. We, therefore, asked if PKA phosphorylates Nedd4-2 in cells. In COS-7 cells expressing Nedd4-2, we either activated PKA with cAMP agonists or inhibited PKA with KT5720. After immunoprecipitation, we then assayed the phosphorylation state of Nedd4-2 in the cell by back-phosphorylation in vitro with PKA and [32P]ATP. In this assay increased Nedd4-2 phosphorylation in the cell results in decreased sites available to incorporate [32P] in vitro. We found that activation of PKA increased Nedd4-2 phosphorylation in cells (compared with untreated cells), as reflected by decreased in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Conversely, inhibition of PKA decreased Nedd4-2 phosphorylation in cells (increased in vitro phosphorylation) (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that Nedd4-2 is phosphorylated by PKA in cells. Moreover, under basal conditions Nedd4-2 appears to be partially phosphorylated. To identify the residues phosphorylated by PKA, we initially focused on three residues that are substrates for SGK (Ser-221, Thr-246, and Ser-327) (15Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 16Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the consensus sequence phosphorylated by SGK (RXRXX(S/T)) overlaps with a PKA consensus (RXX(S/T)), suggesting that these residues might be phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 3C). To test this hypothesis we generated 15 amino acid peptides for each as well as corresponding peptides in which the candidate Ser or Thr was mutated to Ala. We found that each wild-type peptide was phosphorylated by PKA, although Ser-327 was phosphorylated to the greatest extent (Fig. 3D). Mutation of the Ser or Thr blunted phosphorylation of each peptide (Fig. 3D). Thus, Ser-221, Thr-246, and Ser-327 are substrates for phosphorylation by PKA, and Ser-327 is the strongest substrate. Interestingly, each mutant peptide contains 1–2 additional serines that fit potential consensus sites for PKA phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). However, the relative lack of phosphorylation of the mutant peptides (Fig. 3D) suggests that these residues are poor substrates for PKA. Nedd4-2 contains several additional Ser/Thr residues that fit potential PKA motifs. Simultaneous mutation of Ser-221, Thr-246, and Ser-327 did not abolish Nedd4-2 phosphorylation (and did not alter Nedd4-2 protein levels) (Fig. 3A), suggesting that one or more additional sites is a substrate for PKA. Phosphorylation Is Required for cAMP Inhibition of Nedd4-2—We tested if phosphorylation of Ser-221, Thr-246, and Ser-327 is required for cAMP to inhibit Nedd4-2. Simultaneous mutation of the three residues to alanine (S221A/T246A/S327A) nearly abolished the response to cAMP (but did not prevent Nedd4-2 from inhibiting ENaC); cAMP produced only a slight shift in the dose-response relationship (Fig. 3E). Thus, although our biochemical data suggest that they are not the only Nedd4-2 residues phosphorylated by PKA, Ser-221, Thr-246, and Ser-327 are principally responsible for the inhibition of Nedd4-2 by cAMP. However, the small residual effect of cAMP on S221A/T246A/S327A suggests that phosphorylation of one or more additional sites might play a relatively minor role. To determine the relative contribution of the three sites, we mutated them individually. When Ser-221 was mutated to alanine (S221A), cAMP produced a smaller shift in the Nedd4-2 dose-response relationship than wild-type Nedd4-2 (Fig. 3E). This suggests a role for Ser-221 in Nedd4-2 regulation by cAMP. In contrast, mutation of Thr-246 (T246A) did not alter the response to cAMP; the dose-response relationship was similar to wild-type Nedd4-2 (Fig. 3E). Mutation of Ser-327 produced the most dramatic effect; similar to S221A/T246A/S327A, S327A nearly abolished the response to cAMP (Fig. 3E). Thus, Ser-327 is required for cAMP to inhibit Nedd4-2. However, phosphorylation of Ser-327 alone was not sufficient; simultaneous mutation of Ser-221 and Thr-246 (leaving Ser-327 intact) greatly blunted the effect of cAMP on the Nedd4-2 dose-response relationship (Fig. 3E). As predicted, simultaneous mutation of Thr-246 and Ser-327 (leaving Ser-221 intact) or Ser-221 and Ser-327 (leaving Thr-246 intact) nearly abolished the effect of cAMP, similar to S327A and S221A/T246A/S327A (Fig. 3E). Together the data suggest that phosphorylation of both Ser-327 and Ser-221 contribute to Nedd4-2 regulation by cAMP, whereas Thr-246 plays only a minor role. As a comparison, we tested the relative contribution of the three phosphorylation sites for Nedd4-2 regulation by SGK. When coexpressed in FRT epithelia, SGK inhibited Nedd4-2, shifting the Nedd4-2 dose-response relationship to the right (Fig. 3F), as we reported previously (15Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Simultaneous mutation of Ser-221, Thr-246, and Ser-327 (17Snyder P.M. Steines J.C. Olson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5042-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or mutation of Ser-327 individually abolished SGK-inhibition of Nedd4-2 (Fig. 3F). Thus, Ser-327 is required for both SGK and cAMP to inhibit Nedd4-2. However, the relative contribution of the other two sites differed for SGK and cAMP. Mutation of Thr-246 reduced the response to SGK (Fig. 3F) but not to cAMP (Fig. 3E). Conversely, mutation of Ser-221 did not alter the response to SGK (Fig. 3F) but decreased the response to cAMP (Fig. 3E). PKA Decreases Nedd4-2 Binding to ENaC—In order for Nedd4-2 to inhibit ENaC, its WW domains must bind to ENaC PY motifs. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that PKA decreases Nedd4-2 function by reducing its binding to ENaC. Immunoprecipitated Nedd4-2 was phosphorylated with PKA or not phosphorylated and then incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled α-, β-, or γENaC. In the absence of PKA Nedd4-2 bound to each ENaC subunit (Fig. 4). PKA decreased binding to each subunit, suggesting that phosphorylation inhibits Nedd4-2 at least in part by decreasing its binding to ENaC. Convergent Kinase Regulation of ENaC—PKA and SGK phosphorylate Nedd4-2 at a common set of residues, suggesting a model in which these kinases (and their upstream signaling molecules) regulate Na+ transport in part through pathways that converge at Nedd4-2 (Fig. 5A). If correct, this model predicts that manipulating the activity of one pathway will alter the ability of the other pathway to regulate ENaC. To test this hypothesis, we increased SGK activity by overexpressing it with ENaC in FRT epithelia and then measured the increase in ENaC current in response to cAMP agonists. In cells transfected with SGK, cAMP produced a smaller increase in Na+ current than in cells transfected with GFP (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the response to cAMP was nearly abolished in cells transfected with an SGK construct containing an activating mutation (Δ60) (Fig 5B); deletion of the N-terminal 60 residues increases SGK protein levels by reducing its degradation (26Brickley D.R. Mikosz C.A. Hagan C.R. Conzen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43064-43070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As a negative control an inactive SGK mutant (K127M) did not alter ENaC stimulation by cAMP (Fig. 5B). Conversely, we decreased SGK activity by blocking its activation through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (27Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In cells treated with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002), cAMP increased ENaC current to a greater extent than in cells not treated with the inhibitor (Fig. 5B). Thus, changes in SGK activity produced opposite changes in ENaC regulation by cAMP. As a reciprocal strategy, we asked whether increased cAMP would alter ENaC stimulation by SGK. In cells treated with cAMP agonists, SGK increased ENaC current less than in cells not treated with cAMP agonists (Fig. 5C). Together, the data are consistent with a model in which cAMP/PKA and SGK regulate ENaC in part through convergent phosphorylation of Nedd4-2. Nedd4-2 plays a critical role in Na+ homeostasis; by targeting ENaC for endocytosis and degradation, it reduces ENaC surface expression, which decreases epithelial Na+ absorption. In response to conditions of Na+ depletion, two hormonal pathways are activated to maximize Na+ conservation; both vasopressin (via cAMP and PKA) and steroid hormones (aldosterone and glucocorticoids) increase Na+ transport by increasing ENaC expression at the cell surface. Our data together with previous work (15Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 16Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O.

Chem. 2004; 279: 5042-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) suggests that Nedd4-2 is a central convergence point by which these pathways regulate epithelial Na+ transport. We found that Nedd4-2 is a substrate for phosphorylation by PKA both in vitro and in cells. Although multiple residues were phosphorylated, Ser-327 was critical; mutation of this residue nearly abolished Nedd4-2 inhibition by cAMP. Ser-327 is also phosphorylated by SGK, a steroid hormone-induced kinase (15Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 16Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), and this residue is required for SGK inhibition of Nedd4-2. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser-327 is a molecular convergence point for PKA and SGK. However, these kinases also have mechanistic differences; Ser-221 contributed to Nedd4-2 regulation by cAMP (but not SGK), whereas Thr-246 contributed to regulation by SGK (but not cAMP). The relative functional importance of the three residues was Ser-327 > Ser-221 > Thr-246 for PKA and Ser-327 > Thr-246 > Ser-221 for SGK. Nedd4-2 must bind ENaC to catalyze its degradation. Liddle's syndrome illustrates this principle; mutation of one of the ENaC PY motifs increases ENaC surface expression by disrupting binding to Nedd4-2 (17Snyder P.M. Steines J.C. Olson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5042-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Our data and previous work suggest that modulation of Nedd4-2 binding is a general mechanism for ENaC regulation. We found that Nedd4-2 phosphorylation by PKA or SGK (15Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 16Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) decreased its binding to ENaC. Thus, in some respects phosphorylation mechanistically mimics Liddle's syndrome. It seems likely that other kinases also phosphorylate Nedd4-2 and modulate this interaction. The mechanism by which phosphorylation decreases ENaC binding is not yet known. Although our current data do not address this question, we speculate that phosphorylation induces a conformational change that decreases accessibility of the Nedd4-2 WW domains to bind to ENaC PY motifs. ENaC phosphorylation might also influence binding; previous work reported that extracellular-regulated kinase phosphorylates the C termini of βENaC and γENaC, which increased their binding to Nedd4 (29Shi H. Asher C. Chigaev A. Yung Y. Reuveny E. Seger R. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Additional mechanisms might also contribute to ENaC regulation by the vasopressin/cAMP/PKA pathway. Previous work indicates that cAMP increases ENaC exocytosis (20Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Butterworth M.B. Helman S.I. Els W.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: 752-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PKA alters ENaC gating (30Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14037-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, the vasopressin and steroid hormone pathways may intersect at multiple levels in addition to Nedd4-2 phosphorylation. For example, vasopressin and PKA increase mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated transcription (31Massaad C. Houard N. Lombes M. Barouki R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and potentiate mineralocorticoid selectivity by stimulating 11β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (32Alfaidy N. Blot-Chabaud M. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2437-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, cAMP increases the activity of SGK (33Perrotti N. He R.A. Phillips S.A. Renfrew Haft C. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9406-9412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of these mechanisms could vary between tissues or in response to additional signaling pathways. This complexity might explain the observations that the vasopressin and steroid hormone pathways have antagonistic (34Alvarez de la Rosa D. Canessa C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C404-C414Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or synergistic (35Bindels R.J. Schafer J.A. Reif M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 972: 320-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Schafer J.A. Hawk C.T. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 255-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) effects on Na+ transport in different systems. The relative timing of signaling events could also influence the functional interactions between these pathways. Vasopressin produces a rapid increase in Na+ transport (5–15 min), but steroid hormones increase Na+ transport more slowly over a biphasic time course; previous work suggests that SGK contributes to the “early” steroid phase (1–6 h) (18Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Verrey F. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2514-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 19Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Canessa C. Cleaveland E.S. Aldrich G. Fejes-Toth G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16973-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), whereas increased ENaC transcription is important in the “late” phase (>6 h) (37Stokes J.B. Sigmund R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1699-C1707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Masilamani S. Kim G.H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Vasopressin/PKA might acutely phosphorylate Nedd4-2, and then SGK may maintain Nedd4-2 in the phosphorylated state over several hours. Thus, although vasopressin and steroid hormones might work in concert during this early phase to regulate Nedd4-2, they would not be expected to function synergistically. However, during longer steroid exposures, vasopressin might have a synergistic effect by blocking Nedd4-2 regulation of newly synthesized channels. Although our work focused on acute regulation by cAMP, it is worth noting that chronic exposure to vasopressin can also increase ENaC transcription (39Ecelbarger C.A. Kim G.H. Terris J. Masilamani S. Mitchell C. Reyes I. Verbalis J.G. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F46-F53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over a prolonged time course such a mechanism could contribute to synergistic interactions with steroid hormones. Previous work suggests that cAMP increases SGK activity by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of SGK (Thr-369) (33Perrotti N. He R.A. Phillips S.A. Renfrew Haft C. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9406-9412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, we considered the possibility that in addition to phosphorylation of Nedd4-2, PKA might alter Nedd4-2 function indirectly by phosphorylation of SGK. However, three findings argue against a predominant role for such a mechanism. First, inhibition of SGK (with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) increased ENaC stimulation by cAMP. If cAMP regulated Nedd4-2 via SGK, this intervention should have blunted or abolished the response to cAMP. Second, as described above we found that cAMP did not potentiate, but antagonized ENaC regulation by SGK. Third, the relative functional importance of the three Nedd4-2 phosphorylation sites differed for cAMP and SGK. A defect in ENaC regulation by Nedd4-2 is responsible for an inherited form of hypertension (Liddle's syndrome). Although Liddle's syndrome is caused by mutations in ENaC, one might predict that Nedd4-2 mutations would produce a similar phenotype. For example, mutations in the WW domains might decrease Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC, and mutations in the ubiquitin ligase domain might disrupt ENaC ubiquitination. Thus, it is interesting to speculate that Nedd4-2 mutations might contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Fouladkou et al. (40Fouladkou F. Koopaei R.A. Vogt B. Flores S.Y. Malbert-Colas L. Lecomte M.C. Loffing J. Frey F.J. Frey B.M. Staub O. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F550-F561Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) recently identified a Nedd4-2 polymorphism (P355L) that altered Nedd4-2 phosphorylation and produced a small change in Nedd4-2 function. Although this polymorphism appears to be very rare, it raises the possibility that sequence variations in Nedd4-2 or in upstream signaling molecules could alter Nedd4-2 phosphorylation. Increased phosphorylation could cause or predispose to hypertension, whereas decreased phosphorylation might have a protective effect. Thus, it seems possible that Nedd4-2 phosphorylation might play a central role in blood pressure control and in the pathogenesis of hypertension.

Cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts are the predominant component of stroma associated with colon cancer and its functions remain unclear. Fibroblast cell cultures were established from metastatic colon cancer in liver, liver away from the metastatic lesions, and skin from three patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. We generated expression profiles of cancer-associated fibroblasts using oligochip arrays and compared them to those of uninvolved fibroblasts. The conditioned media from the cancer-associated fibroblast cultures enhanced proliferation of colon cancer cell line HCT116 to a greater extent than cultures from uninvolved fibroblasts. In microarray expression analysis, cancer-associated fibroblasts clustered tightly into one group and skin fibroblasts into another. Approximately 170 of 22,000 genes were up-regulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts (fold change > 2, P < 0.05) as compared to skin fibroblasts, including many genes encoding cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, and COX2. By immunohistochemistry in-vivo, we confirmed COX2 and TGFB2 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts in metastatic colon cancer. The distinct molecular expression profiles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in colon cancer metastasis support the notion that these fibroblasts form a favorable microenvironment for cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1969299292,"The observed radioresistance of human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) poses a major challenge, which, if overcome, may lead to significant advances in the management of this patient population. There is accumulating evidence from correlative studies that Survivin expression is associated with increased malignant potential of human gliomas. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Survivin plays a direct role in mediating radiation resistance in primary human glioma cell lines, and, if so, investigating the underlying mechanisms. Our panel of GBM cell lines included two that were relatively radiation resistant (GM20 and GM21) and two that were more radiation sensitive (GM22 and GM23), which demonstrated differential levels of Survivin expression between the two groups. Through the use of adenoviral vectors containing either dominant-negative (pAd-S(T34A)) or wild-type Suvrivin (pAd-S(WT)), we were able to inactivate or overexpress Survivin, respectively. Our findings suggest that Survivin plays a critical role in mediating radiation resistance in primary GBM cells, in part through suppression of apoptotic cell death via a caspase-independent manner. We have identified novel mechanisms by which Survivin may enhance tumor cell survival upon radiation exposure such as regulation of double-strand DNA break repair and tumor cell metabolism, which were most evident in the radiation-resistant cell lines. These differences in Survivin function both in radiation-resistant vs radiation-sensitive cell lines and in the presence vs absence of radiation exposure warrant further investigation and highlight potentially important mechanisms of radiation resistance in these tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2010896383,"Galectin-3, a multifunctional lectin, is involved during cancer progression. Previous observations showed that both cytosolic expression and nuclear exclusion of galectin-3 in human prostate cancer cells were associated to progression of the disease. In this study, we examined the biological roles of galectin-3 when expressed either in the nucleus or in the cytosol. LNCaP, a galectin-3-negative human prostate cancer cell line, was used to generate transfectants expressing galectin-3 either in the nucleus or in the cytosol. No changes in cell morphology, proliferation, attachment to laminin-1 or androgen dependency were observed. Cytoplasmic galectin-3 induced significantly increased Matrigel invasion, anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumor growth and angiogenesis, and decreased inducible apoptosis. Surprisingly, nuclear galectin-3 affected these parameters in an opposite fashion with an overall antitumoral activity. Thus, our study demonstrates that galectin-3 exerts opposite biological activities according to its cellular localization: nuclear galectin-3 plays antitumor functions and cytoplasmic galectin-3 promotes tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2155186551,"Most GISTs require oncogenic activation of the KIT or PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinase proteins, and the genomic mechanisms of oncogene activation are heterogeneous. Notably, the kinase mutation type correlates with both tumor biology and imatinib response. For example, GISTs with KIT exon 11 mutations are typically gastric and have excellent imatinib response, whereas those with KIT exon 9 mutations generally arise in the small bowel and are less responsive to imatinib. To identify genes that might contribute to these biological differences, we carried out gene expression profiling of 26 GISTs with known KIT and PDGFRA mutational status. Expression differences were then evaluated further by RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering grouped tumors with similar mutations together, but the distinction between the different groups was not absolute. Differentially expressed genes included ezrin, p70S6K, and PKCs, which are known to have key roles in KIT or PDGFRA signaling, and which might therefore contribute to the distinctive clinicopathological features in GISTs with different mutation types. These gene products could serve as highly selective therapeutic targets in GISTs containing the KIT or PDGFRA mutational types with which they are associated."
https://openalex.org/W1978402183,"The cyclotides are the largest family of naturally occurring circular proteins. The mechanism by which the termini of these gene-encoded proteins are linked seamlessly with a peptide bond to form a circular backbone is unknown. Here we report cyclotide-encoding cDNA sequences from the plant Viola odorata and compare them with those from an evolutionarily distinct species, Oldenlandia affinis. Individual members of this multigene family encode one to three mature cyclotide domains. These domains are preceded by N-terminal repeat regions (NTRs) that are conserved within a plant species but not between species. We have structurally characterized peptides corresponding to these NTRs and show that, despite them having no sequence homology, they form a structurally conserved α-helical motif. This structural conservation suggests a vital role for the NTR in the in vivo folding, processing, or detoxification of cyclotide domains from the precursor protein.

This structural conservation suggests a vital role for the NTR in the in vivo folding, processing, or detoxification of cyclotide domains from the precursor protein. The discovery of naturally occurring circular proteins has in recent years introduced a new topological paradigm into the field of protein structure. The cyclotides, backbone cyclic proteins of 28–35 amino acid residues isolated from plants, are the largest family of naturally occurring circular proteins (1Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 2Trabi M. Craik D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) (see Table I). Interest in these molecules has been driven by their topological novelty and associated resistance to thermal and enzymatic degradation. They were initially discovered as active components in a tea used in parts of Africa to accelerate childbirth. The uterotonic activity of the prototypic cyclotide kalata B1 was maintained after boiling of the plant Oldenlandia affinis to make the medicinal tea (3Gran L. Acta Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1973; 33: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The remarkable stability of these proteins has been attributed to their novel structure, the cyclic cystine knot motif (4Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 5Craik D.J. Anderson M.A. Barry D.G. Clark R.J. Daly N.L. Jennings C.V. Mulvenna J. Lett. Peptide Sci. 2002; 8: 119-128Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), in which two disulfide bonds and the surrounding peptide sequence form an embedded ring through which a third disulfide bond is threaded. Although the cystine knot motif is found in a wide range of other peptides from sources as diverse as fungi, insects, plants, and animals (6Craik D.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1809-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is only in the cyclotides that this motif is coupled with a cyclic backbone to form the cyclic cystine knot.Table IThe cyclotide family1 Both varv A and varv E were also isolated from other plant species and their sequences published under the names of kalata S and cycloviolacin O12.

The number of cyclotide sequences has grown to over 50 in recent years (7Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Mulvenna J. Plan M.R. Trabi M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2004; 5: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is thought that their natural function is in plant defense (8Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), but there is still relatively little known about the process by which these peptides are synthesized in plants. Our previous isolation of cDNA clones encoding cyclotides from O. affinis, from the Rubiaceae family, has shown that in contrast to well known microbially derived cyclic peptides, which typically contain fewer than 12 residues and are non-ribosomally synthesized by enzyme complexes, the cyclotides are directly encoded by genes (8Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Four clones, named Oak1 through Oak4 (O. affinis kalata-encoding clones 1–4), were isolated in that study, which until now was the only study to report nucleic acid sequences of cyclotides. The precursor proteins predicted from the Oak cDNA clones feature a signal peptide sequence and one to three cyclotide repeats corresponding to mature cyclotide domains. The predicted precursors also exhibit a highly conserved sequence near the N terminus of each of the cyclotide sequences that has been termed the N-terminal repeat (NTR). 1The abbreviations used are: NTR, N-terminal repeat; OaNTR, Oldenlandia affinis NTR; VoNTR, Viola odorata NTR; TFE, trifluoroethanol; NOE, nuclear Overhauser Effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; DQF-COSY, double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy; ECOSY, exclusive correlation spectroscopy. Until now all that was known about the genes that encode cyclotides came from a single Rubiaceae family species, and all of these clones encoded cyclotides from the so-called Moebius sub-class. The cyclotides have been classified into two sub-classes depending on whether they have a proline residue in the fifth loop as shown in Fig. 1. Moebius cyclotides have a cis proline that induces a local backbone twist, whereas bracelet cyclotides do not. In the current study we have isolated cyclotide-encoding cDNA clones from the other major plant family known to express cyclotides, the Violaceae. In particular, we have isolated four cDNA clones from Viola odorata and have found that the precursor proteins predicted from these clones feature the same general arrangement, having an endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide, an N-terminal prodomain, and one to three cyclotide domains each preceded by a conserved sequence of 25 residues at their N termini. As well as reporting the first cDNA sequences encoding cyclotides from the Violaceae family, and isolation of the first cDNA clones encoding bracelet cyclotides, this report examines the structure and function of conserved elements of sequence in the processing of mature cyclotides from their precursor proteins. Many peptides and proteins are produced through processing of larger precursor molecules. Sequences within the precursor that are not part of the mature protein may modulate protein folding and/or structure (9Braun P. Tommassen J. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 6-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Shinde U. Inouye M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Indeed, a diverse range of actions has been found for such propeptides, including modulation of protein folding or protein function, detoxification, and targeting. A recent study of a family of conotoxins, which are disulfide-rich proteins similar in size to the cyclotides, suggests that propeptides may play a role in the protein disulfide isomerase-catalyzed folding of precursor proteins (11Buczek O. Olivera B.M. Bulaj G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this report, the sequences of the precursor proteins predicted from cDNA clones have been determined and are used to identify residues that may be important for cyclotide processing. The solution structures of synthetic peptides based on the NTRs from O. affinis and V. odorata are presented, and the significance of the NTR structure to cyclotide processing is discussed. RNA Isolation and Production of Partial Clones—Total RNA was isolated from V. odorata leaves using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). The partial clones were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total RNA and the Gene Amp® Gold RNA PCR kit from PE Biosystems. The Vok1 cDNA was amplified with Kal2 and oligo(dT) primers as described by Jennings et al. (8Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) (Kal2: GGGGATCCGTITGYGGIGARACITG (BamHI-VCGET)) for amplification of Moebius cyclotide sequences from O. affinis RNA. The Voc1, Voc 2, and Voc3 partial cDNAs were amplified using oligo(dT) with a degenerate forward primer, cyc1, which is complementary to a conserved sequence in the bracelet family of cyclotides (cyc1: TGTGTTTGGATACCTTGC (CVWIPC)). The PCR conditions comprised 30 cycles with the following regime: 94 °C, 1 min; 47 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min. The PCR fragments were gel-purified and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Preparation of the V. odorata cDNA Library and Isolation of Clones— Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA (1 mg) using the PolyATract® mRNA isolation system (Promega). The mRNA (5 μg) was used to construct a cDNA library with the Lambda ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit and packaging extracts from Stratagene. Full-length cDNAs were obtained by screening the library with the [α-32P]dCTP-labeled PCR fragments. Secondary structure of the predicted precursor proteins was predicted in MacVector (12Olson S.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 195-201PubMed Google Scholar) using Chou-Fasman and Robson-Garnier algorithms. Peptide Synthesis—Boc-l-amino acids were obtained from Novabiochem (Laufelfingen, Switzerland) or the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan); t-Boc-Pro-OCH2-PAM resin was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Brisbane, Australia). 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate was obtained from Richelieu Biotechnologies (Quebec, Canada). The following reagents were of peptide synthesis grade and obtained from Auspep (Melbourne, Australia): trifluoroacetic acid, N,N-diisopropylethylene, and N,N-dimethylformamide. Acetonitrile (high-performance liquid chromatography grade) was purchased from BDH (Poole, England). A peptide based on the NTR from the O. affinis clones and another based on the NTR of the V. odorata clones were assembled manually by stepwise solid-phase peptide synthesis using the in situ neutralization protocol of Boc chemistry (13Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) starting from t-Boc-Pro-OCH2-PAM resin on a 0.25-mmol scale. The following side-chain protected amino acids were used: Leu-OH·H2O, Gly-OH, Lys(Clz)-OH, Gln(Xan-OH, Met-OH, Glu-(OcHex)-OH, Phe-OH, Thr(Bzl)-OH, Ser(Bzl)-OH, and Val-OH. The crude peptides were purified by preparative reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (Vydac C18) on a Waters high-performance liquid chromatography system using a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 80 min. Mass spectrometry data were obtained using an atmospheric pressure ionization electrospray mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, PE-Sciex, Canada). NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for various 1H NMR measurements contained 0.2–3.5 mm peptide in 90% 1H2O/10% 2H2O at pH 3.6–5.3. A sample of the VoNTR peptide was also prepared in 20% deuterated trifluoroethanol (TFE)/70% 1H2O/10% 2H2O. For structure determination samples at 3.5 mm and pH 3.6 were used. Spectra were acquired on Bruker ARX 500- and 750-MHz spectrometers, mainly at 298 K, but for clarification of some assignments additional spectra were acquired at 280 K and 310 K. NOESY spectra were acquired with mixing times of 250 and 300 ms for OaNTR and 200, 150, and 100 ms for VoNTR. Solvent suppression in DQF-COSY and ECOSY experiments was achieved using selective low power irradiation of the water resonance during a relaxation delay of 1.8 s. In NOESY and TOCSY experiments, a modified WATERGATE sequence was used to achieve solvent suppression. Chemical shifts were internally referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulponate. Slow exchange experiments were performed following dissolution of the protonated peptides in 2H2O or in 20% deuterated TFE/80% 2H2O. TOCSY and one-dimensional experiments were conducted to monitor the exchange of the amide protons with the solvent. Amide proton signals that still appeared 60 min after dissolution in 2H2O were regarded as slow exchanging. Spectra were processed using XWINNMR software (Bruker) on an SGI Octane2 workstation. Distance restraints were derived from the intensities of cross-peaks in NOESY spectra recorded with mixing times of 100–250 ms. Inter-proton distance restraints and pseudo-atom corrections were applied where necessary, and empirical corrections were added to intensities associated with methyl protons (14Clore G.M. Brunger A.T. Karplus M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 523-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Dihedral angle assignments were made from a combination of coupling constants and NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) intensities: ϕ angle restraints were assigned based on 3JHN-Hα couplings measured from one-dimensional and DQF-COSY spectra, whereas χ1 angles were assigned based on 3JHα-Hβ couplings measured from ECOSY spectra and observed NOE intensities. Preliminary three-dimensional structures of the peptides were determined using X-PLOR version 3.851 (15Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1 A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University, New Haven1992Google Scholar). Starting from a template structure with randomized ϕ and ψ angles and extended side chains, the program generated an ensemble of 50 structures using an ab initio simulated annealing protocol. These structures were subjected to high temperature dynamics (1000 K), with low initial weighting on the force constant and NOE restraints, prior to cooling to 100 K. Each structure was energy-minimized for 1000 cycles using the Powell algorithm and a refined CHARMM force-field. Final structures were calculated in CNS (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) with energy minimization in a water shell (17Rosengren K.J. Clark R.J. Daly N.L. Goransson U. Jones A. Craik D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 12464-12474Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The structures were displayed using Insight II (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA) or MolMol (18Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29–32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and analyzed using PROMOTIF (19Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Previously we reported the isolation of four cDNA clones encoding cyclotide precursors from O. affinis, from the Rubiaceae, and prior to the current report these were the only known cyclotide-encoding clones. The O. affinis clones only encode cyclotides from the Moebius sub-class. In the current study it was of interest to isolate cDNAs from a plant species that is evolutionarily distant from O. affinis and also to isolate cDNAs encoding cyclotides from the other sub-class, namely bracelet cyclotides. V. odorata was screened, because it is both evolutionarily distant from O. affinis and a rich source of bracelet cyclotides (1Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 21Svangard E. Goransson U. Smith D. Verma C. Backlund A. Bohlin L. Claeson P. Phytochemistry. 2003; 64: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Isolation of V. odorata cDNA Clones and Comparison with the Oak Clones—Forward primers based on cyclotide sequences were used with oligo(dT) in reverse transcription-PCR to amplify cDNA-encoding cyclotides from V. odorata total leaf RNA. The partial cDNA clones were sequenced and used individually to screen a leaf cDNA library for full-length clones. Using the same forward primer that was used to isolate the Oak clones from O. affinis, which is based on loop 1 of the Moebius cyclotide kalata B1 (Fig. 1 and Table I; VCGET), we cloned a Moebius sub-class member from V. odorata. Conservation of the general structure of the genes, discussed in more detail below and shown in Fig. 2, indicates that they have evolved from an ancestral gene present in flowering plants before diversification of the asterid and rosid lineages in the eudicots. To isolate clones encoding members of the bracelet class of cyclotides, we designed a new primer complementary to a sequence that is conserved in loop 2 (Fig. 1), CVWIPC (Table I), of the bracelet cyclotides. This approach led to the identification of three cDNAs encoding bracelet cyclotides. In total, four full-length cDNA clones were isolated. The predicted protein sequences are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2. For comparison, the earlier clones from O. affinis are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2. Nomenclature for the V. odorata clones follows that used for the O. affinis clones, where kalata-encoding cDNA clones were named OaKx, with x related to the order of discovery. The Moebius clone encodes a precursor with a single copy of kalata B1 and two copies of kalata S and was therefore named Vok1 (V. odorata kalata encoding clone 1). The Vok1 precursor is remarkably similar in structure to the Oak4 precursor, shown in Fig. 2, with three cyclotide repeats separated by conserved NTRs, an N-terminal signal sequence, and a small C-terminal tail. The bracelet cyclotide clones, Voc1, Voc2, and Voc3 (V. odorata cycloviolacin encoding clones), encode cycloviolacin O8, cycloviolacin O11, and cycloviolacin O13, a cycloviolacin/circulin-like peptide that has not been reported previously (numbering is based on the reported peptide sequences in Table I). These clones all resemble Oak1, encoding precursors with just one cyclotide repeat, with an endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence, an N-terminal pro-domain, NTR, and small C-terminal tail. The amino acid identities of the cyclotide and NTR domains of the O. affinis and V. odorata clones relative to Oak1 and Voc1 are summarized in Table II. Cyclotide domains in the Moebius group share greater than 79% identity at the amino acid level irrespective of whether they are sequences from the Rubiaceae or Violaceae. When the Moebius and bracelet mature cyclotide domains are compared they share only 40% identity. Interestingly, the NTR sequences are not as tightly conserved, and the sequences cluster according to the plant of origin rather than the Moebius or bracelet groupings. Conservation of the N-terminal signal sequences and NTRs between Vok1 and the Voc clones is not as great as in the Oak clones, but then this is to be expected, because the Oak clones all encode kalata variants, whereas the V. odorata clones encode cyclotides from different sub-classes, i.e. kalata and cycloviolacin variants.Table IIPercentage amino acid identity of cyclotide and NTR domains with the cyclotide and NTR domains of the Oak1 and Voc1 precursorsCyclotideNTR (25Kliemannel M.

Surprisingly, however, the NTRs are not conserved in sequence between species, so it was of interest to investigate possible structural conservation. Structure prediction suggested that the NTRs are helical. To experimentally verify this, two peptides were synthesized; one based on the NTR from the O. affinis clones and another based on the NTR of the V. odorata clones (named OaNTR and VoNTR, respectively). Both peptides were designed from the NTR sequences preceding a C-terminal cyclotide repeat domain and were synthesized using solid phase peptide chemistry. The sequences of these peptides are in Fig. 2. The OaNTR peptide was designed based on the conserved 19 amino acids just upstream of the cyclotide repeat in Oak2. The NTR sequence from Oak2 was used, because it has a higher homology with the other repeat fragments than the NTR of Oak1. The first three amino acids of the mature cyclotide domain, Gly-Leu-Pro, were also included in the peptide. The VoNTR peptide incorporated all of the sequence between the second and third cyclotide domains in Vok1, that is, the conserved 19 residues and the 6 remaining N-terminal residues. As with the OaNTR peptide, the first 3 residues of the adjacent cyclotide domain (Gly, Leu, and Pro) were included. NMR spectra were recorded, and the amino acid spin systems of the OaNTR and VoNTR peptides were identified using a combination of TOCSY and DQF-COSY spectra at 298 K. Sequential assignments were completed using TOCSY and NOESY spectra. Ambiguities due to overlap were resolved from additional spectra acquired at 280 K or 310 K. Secondary αH shifts, that is, the differences between observed αH shifts in the peptide of interest and those for the corresponding residues in random coil peptides, are indicative of secondary structure. In aqueous solution the C-terminal half of OaNTR exhibits negative secondary shifts typical of helix, as may be seen in Fig. 3. The sample conditions of 298 K, 3.5 mm, and pH 3.6 were chosen, respectively, to provide good dispersion, good sensitivity, and to minimize exchange broadening of amide signals. A series of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra recorded with concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 mm and pH from 3.6 to 5.3 showed no substantial changes in αH chemical shifts, suggesting that the helical tendency is not critically dependent on solution concentration or pH over these ranges. The secondary shifts of the VoNTR peptide in water are also indicative of nascent helix in the conserved region highlighted in Fig. 3. To evaluate this helical tendency, TFE, a solvent that is known to stabilize helices in peptides that have an intrinsic propensity for helicity (22Buck M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 297-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), was added to the solution. Comparison of the secondary shifts of the V. odorata repeat fragment dissolved in water and 20% TFE, shown in Fig. 3, reveals that the addition of TFE clearly increases the helicity of the peptide. The secondary structures of the OaNTR molecule were further inferred from a qualitative analysis of sequential and medium-range NOE intensities, amide proton slow exchange information and coupling constants, which are summarized in Fig. 4. Many strong to medium strength dNN(i, i+1) and medium strength dαN(i, i+1) and some medium range NOEs were present between residues in the region of Ser-5 to Leu-21. Slow exchanging amide protons were detected from a series of one-dimensional spectra recorded up to 60 min after dissolution in 2H2O. These slow exchange protons correspond to residues Phe-12, Leu-13, and Glu-15 to Leu-21. All amide protons had exchanged by 60 min, and although this is faster than what is commonly seen for larger well structured proteins, the existence of an extensive set of observable amide protons in 2H2O indicates a high degree of structural ordering in this small peptide. Indeed the NOE pattern and slowly exchanging amide protons are strongly indicative of a helix in the region Phe-12 to Leu-21. Similarly, slow exchange and NOE data confirmed that the VoNTR peptide forms a helix over residues His-9 to Lys-20. Dissolution of the fully protonated VoNTR peptide in 2H2O identified four slow exchanging amide protons. Slow exchange experiments in the presence of 20% deuterated TFE identified the amide protons of residues Leu-10, Leu-11, and Glu-13 to Lys-21 as slow exchanging. This is consistent with the VoNTR peptide featuring a nascent helical structure in water that is stabilized by the addition of 20% TFE. The structures of the OaNTR peptide were generated using 172 inter-proton distances derived from 110 sequential, 59 medium range, and four long range NOEs, and 12 backbone (ϕ) and two side-chain (χ1) dihedral angle restraints. The residues Leu-9 to Leu-13, Met-16, Leu-18, Lys-19, and Leu-21 were assigned ϕ angles of –65 ± 30° and ϕ restraints of –100 ± 80° were applied for Ser-4, Glu-6, and Thr-7 based on additional coupling and NOE data. Stereospecific assignments of methylene protons and χ1 dihedral angle restraints (60 ± 30°) were derived for Ser-4 and Ser-5. Two NOEs were observed for Hαi-1-Hδi for Leu-21 and Pro-22, indicating that Pro-22 was in the trans conformation. The structures of the VoNTR peptide were calculated using 143 inter-proton distances, including 82 sequential and 61 medium range NOEs derived from NOESY spectra acquired with the peptide dissolved in 20% TFE/80% 2H2O. Although the COSY couplings measured for the VoNTR were inconclusive due to large linewidths, some ϕ angles could be inferred due to the distinct differences in cross-peak intensities observed in the spectrum. In particular the cross-peaks for residues His-9 to Lys-20 were weak relative to those for all other residues so the ϕ angles for these residues could confidently be assigned as –65 ± 15°. The β-methylene protons of residue Glu-3 were stereospecifically assigned, and the corresponding χ1 angle was restrained to –60 ± 30°. Sequential NOEs were observed for Hαi-1-Hδi for Lys-6 and Pro-7 and for Leu-27 and Pro-28, indicating that Pro-7 and Pro-28 were both in the trans conformation. The restraints used to calculate both structures are summarized in Fig. 4, from which it is apparent that there are a greater number of NOEs that are typical of helices found in OaNTR than in VoNTR. However, in the VoNTR spectra there is some overlap of Hα shifts, and as a result potential dα-N(i, i+4) and dα-N(i, i+3) NOEs were overlapped with sequential NOEs. The final set of OaNTR structures, generated from energy minimization in a water shell, was analyzed, and the 20 structures with the lowest overall energies were selected. The ensemble of structures is shown in Fig. 5, superimposed over the backbone atoms of residues Thr-7 to Gly-20. A ribbon depiction of a representative structure is also included in Fig. 5 and shows that the C-terminal part of the peptide, between residues Thr-7 to Gly-20 adopts an α-helical conformation. The N-terminal region is less ordered. The view down the helical axis in Fig. 5 shows that the OaNTR peptide forms an amphipathic helix, with hydrophobic residues clustered on the opposite side of the helix to the charged residues. The geometric and energetic statistics that define the family of low energy OaNTR structures are given in Table III. No significant deviations from idealized covalent geometry were observed. The superimposition of the ensemble of structures is excellent over residues Thr-7 to Gly-20, with a pairwise backbone r.m.s.d. of 0.49 ± 0.16 Å. There is slight fraying at the C-terminal and a degree of disorder near the N-terminal, with an overall pairwise backbone r.m.s.d. of 1.75 ± 0.64 Å. This reflects the general structure of the molecule, where the C-terminal half adopts a well defined α-helix and the N-terminal region is relatively disordered. Hydrogen bond restraints were not included in the structure calculations but were identified to be Phe-12 HN–Thr-8 O, Leu-13 HN–Leu-9 O, Glu-15 HN–Met-11 O"
https://openalex.org/W2165301262,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades are multifunctional signaling networks that influence cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and cellular responses to stress. Since the activation/propagation of MAPK signaling requires the sequential phosphorylation of many downstream proteins, the phosphatases that dephosphorylate MAPKs represent critical elements in the control of MAPK-signaling networks. Here we show that hypoxia induces a transient increase in the activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1), a MAPKKK that responds to oxidative stress by triggering cascades leading to the phosphorylation/activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38-MAPK. Hypoxia-induced ASK-1/MKK-4/JNK signaling is suppressed by serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 5 (PP5), which acts to turn off ASK-1/MKK-4/JNK signaling via two mechanisms. First, in a rapid response hypoxia facilitates the association of endogenous PP5 with ASK-1. PP5 binds to the C-terminal domain of ASK-1, and studies with siRNA targeting PP5 indicate that PP5 acts to suppress the phosphorylation of MKK4 (Thr-261), JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), and c-Jun (Ser-63) without affecting the activating phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182), p44/p42-MAPK/ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), or c-Jun protein levels. If hypoxia is prolonged, the expression of PP5 is increased due to the activation of a transcriptional activator, which was identified as hypoxia-inducible factor-1. Together, these studies indicate that PP5 plays an important role in the survival of cells in a low oxygen environment by suppressing a hypoxia-induced ASK-1/MKK4/JNK signaling cascade that promotes an apoptotic response.

Studies designed to illuminate the molecular mechanisms of MAPK signaling indicate that the propagation and amplification of signals results from a series of phosphorylation-dependent reactions, in which the activation of an upstream kinase leads to the sequential phosphorylation and activation of a series of downstream kinases. In mammals, the major MAP signaling cascades consists of a three-tier network of protein kinases: the MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs), the MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs, also referred to as MEKs) and the MAP-kinases (MAPKs). MAPKKKs are Ser/Thr kinases that receive signals from activated receptors on the cell surface or through interactions with other proteins (e.g. GTP-binding proteins, thioredoxin-1). MAPKKKs act by phosphorylating downstream substrate proteins, principally MAPKKs. Once phosphorylated, MAPKKs act as “dual specificity” kinases that phosphorylate Ser/Thr and Tyr residues of MAPKs, thereby stimulating the kinase activity of MAPKs. In humans, there are four major families of MAPKs, the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK1/2/3), the p38 family of kinases (p38α/β/γ/δ), and ERK5 (1Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). The ERKs are generally responsive to growth factors and contribute to proliferation, development, differentiation, and cell survival. Both the JNKs and the p38s are activated in response to cytokines and stress, with the activation of JNKs contributing to apoptosis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. The activation of p38s affects cell motility, apoptosis, chromatin remodeling, and osmoregulation (1Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). In addition to the direct activation of designated downstream kinases, there is considerable cross-talk among the various MAP kinase signaling cascades. Since the MAPKs, MAPKKs, and MAPKKKs are activated by phosphorylation, the protein phosphatases that act to dephosphorylate these kinases represent critical elements in the control of MAPK-signaling networks. Surprisingly, little is known about the phosphatases involved, especially at the level of the MAPKKs and MAPKKKs. Ser/Thr phosphatase 5 (PP5) is an okadaic acid/microcystin/calyculin A-sensitive phosphatase (2Chinkers M. Trends Endocrinol.

Like the other PPP-phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B/calcineurin, PP4, PP6, and PP7), PP5 is highly conserved among species, and PP5 is expressed in most, if not all, mammalian cells. In vitro PP5 can dephosphorylate many phosphoproteins associated with the propagation of cellular responses to stress (i.e. p53 (5Urban G. Golden T. Aragon I.V. Cowsert L. Cooper S.R. Dean N.M.

However, recent structural studies indicate that the catalytic site of PP5 is located in a shallow pocket on the surface that could easily accommodate nonphysiological substrates in vitro (10Swingle M.R.

Thus, the ability to dephosphorylate a protein in vitro may not accurately reflect a specific role for PP5 in vivo. Nonetheless, PP5 associates with many proteins that affect cellular signaling networks, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-heat shock protein 90 (Hsp-90) heterocomplex (11Chen M.S.

These associations suggest that PP5 may play an underappreciated role in the regulation of signal transduction cascades that regulate cellular responses to stress. In a MCF-7 mouse xenograph tumor model, the overexpression of PP5 is associated with a marked increase in the rate of tumor growth, with a statistical difference in tumor size noted in <14 days (19Golden T.A. Aragon I.V. Zhou G. Cooper S.R. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. Cancer Lett. 2004; 215: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggested that the overexpression of PP5 aids xenograph tumor growth. Since the vascular system in mouse xenograph tumors is usually aberrant and provides poor blood flow to the developing tumor, regions within the tumors become hypoxic. Here, we show that hypoxia induces a transient increase in ASK-1/MKK4/JNK activity and that PP5 acts to turn off ASK-1/MKK-4/JNK signaling. Together, the studies presented suggest that the growth advantage of MCF-7 xenograph tumors in which PP5 expression is constitutively elevated (19Golden T.A. Aragon I.V. Zhou G. Cooper S.R. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. Cancer Lett. 2004; 215: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) may be derived from PP5 acting as a negative regulator of an ASK-1/MKK4/JNK signaling cascade that facilitates an apoptotic response in hypoxic cells.

Cell Culture—Human A549 lung carcinoma cells, Hep3B hepatoma, HEK 293, and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection. MCF-7 and A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (0.1 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). Hep3B cells were cultured in minimal essential medium with l-glutamine and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, pyruvate (1 mm), and nonessential amino acids (0.1 mm). All cell cultures were routinely passed when 85–90% confluent unless indicated otherwise. MCF-7-PP5h1 cells were developed and cultured as described previously (20Urban G. Golden T. Aragon I.V.

Western Blotting—Cells grown in 60-mm plates were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by scraping in 250 μl of lysis buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 1 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and an aliquot of the supernatant was removed for protein determination. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad Dc protein assay, using bovine serum albumin for standards. The remaining supernatant was added to an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). Typically, 25–50 μg of protein was then separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.) and placed in blocking buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% nonfat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. Immunoblotting was performed with the indicated primary antibody using either goat anti-mouse (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) or goat anti-rabbit secondary (Promega, Madison, WI) antibodies. Antibody association was detected employing ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or Super Signal West Dura (Pierce) Western blotting detection reagents following the protocols of the manufacturer. Quantification of the signal was achieved using a Fuji-LAS-1000 imaging system. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts for electrophoretic mobility shift assay assays were prepared essentially as described previously (21Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, Hep3B or A549 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes (three dishes per group) and treated with the indicated agents. At the times indicated, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in 0.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 2000 × g. The pellet was washed with five packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm activated Na3VO4) and resuspended in 4 packed cell volumes of buffer A. After sitting on ice for 10 min, the nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear fraction was washed twice, and the nuclei were resuspended in 3 packed nuclear volumes of buffer C (0.42 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). The suspension was rotated for 30 min at 4 °C and then subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Double-stranded DNA probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assay were generated by radiolabeling synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the HRE contained in the promoter of PP5 or erythropoietin (EPO) (sequences provided in Fig. 2) using a DECA-Prime® labeling kit (Ambion). Binding reactions were performed under stringent conditions by incubating 5.0 μg of nuclear extract with ∼1.0 ng of 32P-labeled probe (104 cpm) in buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.2 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.6; final volume 19 μl) for 5 min at room temperature and then for 15 min on ice. For competition experiments, unlabeled probes (in 20-fold excess) were added to the mixture. For shift analysis, after the addition of probe, 0.25 μg of HIF-1α antibody was added to the mixture, and binding was conducted on ice for 20 min. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The sequence of the sense strand for each probe is listed: RH309, CCTGCGCAGGCGCGT-GAAGGGC, PP5 wild type; RH325, GCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA, EPO HIF-1α response element; RH335, CCAGCGCAGGCGAAAGAAGGGC, RH309 with the consensus HIF-1 binding site altered in three positions; RH337, CGGCGATGGCCTGCGAGCGGAC, PP5 scramble control (random order of nucleotides contained in RH309). Construction of Luciferase Reporter and HA-tagged Expression Plasmids—pLuc-Link constructs containing the indicated regions of the 5′-flanking region of human PP5 were made using conventional cloning techniques. Briefly, to obtain the 5′-flanking region of human PP5, sense oligonucleotides corresponding to the indicated 5′-flanking region at –643, –184, –129, and –110 (Fig. 2A) were employed in combination with an antisense oligonucleotide RH252 (5′-CCCAAGCTTCAAA-GCGACCCCTACCCTGGCAACGGC-3′). The sense primers employed were as follows: RH253 (–643), 5′-TGGGATCCGAAAGGAGATGGTG-CAACACACTTCTAAGC-3′; RH254 (–184), 5′-CGGGATCCTGGTCAC-CTTGTCCTCCGCGCGCTCTGTG-3′; RH356 (–129), 5′-CGGGATCC-AAGGGCGCCTTCAGGG-3′; and RH250 (–110), 5′-CGGGATCCAGC-GCTTTACGACACTTGTGCGGCAG-3′. To facilitate cloning, BamHI and HindIII restriction sites were engineered at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The PCR products were then subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector, pLucLinkV.2 (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Day, University of Virginia). The HIF-1 consensus sequence was altered using a Site-Direct mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using primer RH357 (5′-GGACCTGCGCAGGCGAAAGAAGGGCACCTTC-3′) and primer RH358, which is antisense to RH357. The fidelity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing.

Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assay—Cell transfections and Luciferase assays were conducted as described previously (20Urban G. Golden T. Aragon I.V. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27638-27646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, A549 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/60-mm tissue culture dish and incubated overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After ∼24 h, the cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described previously (20Urban G. Golden T. Aragon I.V. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27638-27646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After 4 h, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh media, and the cells were incubated for another 20 h prior to treatment with the agents indicated. Hypoxic conditions were achieved by incubating cell cultures in an anaerobic pouch (GasPack Pouch; Becton Dickinson). At the times indicated, luciferase activity was measured using the enhanced luciferase assay kit (PharMingen) with a Monolight 2010 luminometer. The ratio of luciferase activity to total protein (as measured with a Bio-Rad Dc assay) was calculated. Measurement of ASK-1 Activity—ASK-1 activity was measured using myelin basic protein (MBP; Sigma) as a substrate as described previously (22Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysate, 500 μg of protein, was mixed with 5 μgof anti-ASK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C with gentile rocking for ∼16 h. ASK-1 was collected by centrifugation (3000 × g for 1 min). The pellet was washed three times with IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm activated sodium orthovanadate, 2 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture, 5 μm cantharidin, 5 mm NaF, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) and then one time with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2). Myelin basic protein (3 μg) was then added, and the kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP (50 μm) containing 1–5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was then terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating. Unincorporated 32P was separated by electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 12% gels. Radioactivity incorporated into MBP was quantified using a Fuji FLA-5000 phosphor-imaging system. ASK-1 activity is reported as the ratio of the amount of phosphate incorporated into MBP divided by the amount of ASK-1 protein in the assay. Microcystin-Sepharose Pull-down Assays—Microcystin pull-down assays were conducted essentially as described previously (23Kloeker S. Reed R. McConnell J.L. Chang D. Tran K. Westphal R.S. Law B.K. Colbran R.J. Kamoun M. Campbell K.S. Wadzinski B.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 300,000 cells/dish in 60-mm dishes and allowed to grow for ∼48 h. The dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from the dish in 400 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 6.3 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). The cells were then lysed on ice with a Kontes tissue grinder (30 strokes in a 2-ml tube). The lysates were subjected to centrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min), the supernatant was collected, and protein concentration in the crude lysate was determined using a Bio-Rad Dc protein assay. Aliquots of lysate containing 1 mg of protein were then mixed with 30 μl of 50% Sepharose 4B slurry and mixed at 4 °C for 1 h to remove nonspecific binding. The Sepharose 4B was collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was mixed with 30 μl of microcystin-Sepharose (equilibrated with extraction buffer) by circular end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for ∼16 h. The microcystin-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), and the pellet was washed six times with 600 μl of washing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 6.3 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml pepstatin A). Proteins were eluted from the pellets with 2× SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels. Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzoL (Invitrogen). First strand cDNAs were synthesized using 0.6 μg RNA as template, random hexamer primers (2.5 μm), and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase at 42 °C using GeneAmp (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the procedures provided by the manufacturer. Primers for the amplification of PP5 and β-actin are as follows: PP5, 5′-atggggaacaaagcctcctaca-3′ and 5′-cgtcacctcacatcattc-ctagc-3′; β-actin, 5′-tgtgcccatctacgaggggtatgc-3′ and 5′-ggtacatggtggt-gccgccagaca-3′. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed (95 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 45 s) using an iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) with SYBR green. Suppression of PP5 Expression with Double-stranded RNA (siRNA)—siRNA-mediated suppression of PP5 was achieved as described previously (24Golden T.A. Honkanen R.E. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 366: 372-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, polyribonucleotides (21 bases in length) were synthesized in both the sense and antisense orientation, with 19 bases homologous to the target mRNA and two 2′-deoxythymidine nucleotides at 3′-ends that produce 3′-overhangs upon annealing. The oligonucleotides were annealed to produce siRNA by placing the complementary ribonucleotides (20 μm) in RNase-free annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate) for 1 min at 90 °C and then at 37 °C for 1 h. The sense strand of the siRNA that effectively suppressed PP5 (PP5TG2) is 5′-GAG GGU GAG GUG AAG GCC ATT-3′. For a control, the order of the bases was scrambled. The sense strand for the mismatched control (PP5 TG2MM) is 5′-GGU AGG ACG AGA GGU AGG CTT-3′. For treatment, A549 cells were plated at 200,000–300,000 cells/60-mm dish. Twenty-four hours later, the annealed double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were transfected using Lipofectin® (Invitrogen), employing the same methods used for the addition of antisense oligonucleotides (6Zuo Z.

Briefly, the day after plating, the cells were washed with DMEM and incubated with 1 ml of DMEM containing 15 μl/ml Lipofectin and 2.5 μg of siRNA that was mixed in a Falcon tube via shaking by hand for 1 min just prior to the addition. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the DMEM was removed and replaced with fresh media supplemented as described above (see “Cell Culture”). Hypoxia Induces the Expression of PP5—To characterize the relationship between PP5 and hypoxia, time course studies were conducted in A549 and Hep3B cells measuring PP5 protein levels by Western analysis. As seen in Fig. 1, when placed in hypoxic conditions, there is a temporal increase in PP5 protein levels in both cell lines, with a statistical difference from controls evident by 5 h. Northern analysis revealed a 1.89 ± 0.2-fold (mean ± S.D., n = 4) increase in PP5 mRNA levels 8 h after the onset of hypoxia, and reverse transcription-PCR revealed a similar 2.04 ± 0.12-fold (p < 0.01) increase in PP5 mRNA levels in hypoxic cells, suggesting that the increased levels of protein result from an increase in PP5 transcription. Characterization of the Human PP5 Promoter—Analysis of a 1.9-megabase region of human chromosome 19 q13.3 identified the PP5 gene (PPP5) and 43.5 kilobases 5′ of PP5 exon 1. 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis of human cDNA identified ∼758 base pairs 5′ of the coding region, and a deletion series of PP5-pLucLink V.2 luciferase reporter plasmids was constructed and tested in transient transfection assays (20Urban G.

The region between –184 and –110 was identified as an important regulatory domain in the PP5 promoter (i.e. PP5-Luc-184 demonstrated comparable luciferase activity to the “full-length” promoter, whereas PP5-Luc-110 had levels similar to the control Luc link vector (20Urban G.

https://openalex.org/W2027325857,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for the DNA cleavage step in immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR). AID is proposed to deaminate cytosine to generate uracil (U) in either mRNA or DNA. In the second instance, DNA cleavage depends on uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) for removal of U. Using phosphorylated histone γ-H2AX focus formation as a marker of DNA cleavage, we found that the UNG inhibitor Ugi did not inhibit DNA cleavage in immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus during CSR, even though Ugi blocked UNG binding to DNA and strongly inhibited CSR. Strikingly, UNG mutants that had lost the capability of removing U rescued CSR in UNG –/– B cells. These results indicate that UNG is involved in the repair step of CSRyet by an unknown mechanism. The dispensability of U removal in the DNA cleavage step of CSR requires a reconsideration of the model of DNA deamination by AID."

Here, we report the purification and characterization of a novel VEGF-like protein from Trimeresurus flavoviridis Habu snake venom. The Habu snake has a venom-specific VEGF-like molecule, T. flavoviridis snake venom VEGF (TfsvVEGF), in addition to VEGF-A. TfsvVEGF has almost 10-fold less mitotic activity than VEGF165, a predominant isoform of human VEGF-A, but a similar effect on vascular permeability. TfsvVEGF bound VEGFR-1 and induced its autophosphorylation to almost the same extent as VEGF165, but bound VEGFR-2 weakly and induced its autophosphorylation almost 10-fold less effectively than VEGF165. This unique binding affinity for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 leads to the vascular permeability-dominant activity of TfsvVEGF. These results suggest that Habu snakes have acquired a highly purposive molecule for a toxin, which enhances the toxicity in envenomation without inducing effective angiogenesis and the following regeneration of damaged tissues, taking advantage of the difference in signaling properties involving VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 between vascular permeability and angiogenesis.

Human VEGF-A has at least six subtypes due to the alternative splicing of a single gene, VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF183, VEGF189, and VEGF206 (1Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat.

Among them, VEGF165 has the most potent biological activity and is the most abundant subtype in vivo with a few exceptions such as in placenta. VEGF-A binds to and activates two tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1 in mice) (1Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat.

In addition, VEGF165 also binds another membrane protein, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) (9Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M.

Homologs of VEGF have also been identified in the genome of the Parapoxvirus Orf virus and shown to have VEGF-like activities. VEGF-E is the collective term for a group of these proteins, and all VEGF-E variants studied bind VEGFR-2, but not VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-3 (14Ogawa S. Oku A. Sawano A. Yamaguchi S. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. J.

Homozygous loss of the VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 gene results in embryonic lethality between days 8.5 and 9.5, indicating that these VEGFRs play important roles in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (17Fong G.H.

Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). VEGFR-2- homozygous mice die due to a lack of endothelial cell growth and blood vessel formation as well as extremely poor hematopoiesis. On the other hand, VEGFR-1- homozygous mice die due to an overgrowth of endothelial cells and disorganization of blood vessels. The different phenotypes of these VEGFR- homozygous mice suggest that VEGFR-2 is the major positive signal transducer, whereas VEGFR-1 has a negative regulatory role in angiogenesis early in embryogenesis. A VEGFR-2-selective VEGF mutant or VEGF-E (a VEGFR-2-specific ligand) is able to induce vascular permeability to an extent indistinguishable from that of wild-type VEGF165, whereas a VEGFR-1-selective VEGF mutant or PlGF (a VEGFR-1-specific ligand) has little or no direct permeability-enhancing activity (10Park J.E.

Therefore, not only physiological angiogenesis but also the enhancement of vascular permeability have been considered to be mediated through VEGFR-2 (but not VEGFR-1) activation. In contrast to the negative regulatory role of VEGFR-1 in physiological angiogenesis, recent studies have shown that VEGFR-1 signaling is important for angiogenesis and plasma extravasation under pathological conditions (20Carmeliet P.

Recently, several VEGF-like proteins have been isolated from snake venoms (22Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi K. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11796-11803Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Junqueira de Azevedo I.L. Farsky S.H. Oliveira M.L. Ho P.L. J. Biol.

However, several fundamental questions remain unanswered. First, is the VEGF-like protein of snake venom a splicing variant of VEGF-A or not? Snakes should have VEGF-A for their own physiological angiogenesis because the VEGF-VEGFR system is well conserved among vertebrates. However, the relation between snake venom VEGF and VEGF-A is still unclear. Second, if the VEGF-like protein of snake venom is distinct from VEGF-A, what is the difference in biological activity and molecular mechanism between them? Assuming that snakes have two different VEGF-like molecules, there should be some advantage to the host or some reason why the snake utilizes these apparently similar molecules for different purposes, one as a toxin and another for physiological angiogenesis. In this study, we carried out the purification and characterization of a novel VEGF-like protein from Trimeresurus flavoviridis (or Protobothrops flavoviridis) Habu snake venom. The Habu snake is a deadly poisonous snake found in Southeast Asia, whose envenomation causes severe hemorrhage. We demonstrate that T. flavoviridis snake venom VEGF (TfsvVEGF) is distinct from T. flavoviridis VEGF (TfVEGF)-A and that the dominant activation of VEGFR-1 and the less extensive activation of VEGFR-2 by TfsvVEGF result in marked vascular hyperpermeability and weak endothelial cell mitotic activity. Understanding the signaling mechanism utilized by TfsvVEGF enables one to recognize the importance of VEGFR-1 signaling in physiological vascular permeability. Snake Venom and Cell Cultures—Venom was collected from T. flavoviridis Habu snakes inhabiting the Amami Oshima Islands in Japan and kept in a lyophilized state. Sf9 cells were cultured in EX-CELL 400 medium (JRH Biosciences). NIH3T3-NRP-1 cells were established as described previously (11Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar) using the pCAG-NRP-1 plasmid. NIH3T3-VEGFR-1 cells (25Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar), NIH3T3-VEGFR-2 cells (26Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and NIH3T3-NRP-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical) supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 40 μg/ml kanamycin, and 200 μg/ml G418. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Kurabo Industries) were maintained in HuMedia-EG2 medium (Kurabo Industries) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sinusoidal endothelial (SE) cells were isolated from rat liver as described (27Yamane A. Seetharam L. Yamaguchi S. Gotoh N. Takahashi T. Neufeld G. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2683-2690PubMed Google Scholar) and grown in HuMedia-EG2 medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml recombinant human VEGF165 (R&D Systems). Antibodies—Polyclonal antisera against TfsvVEGF were raised in rabbits using a C-terminal 19-amino acid sequence (residues 104–122) or a 20-amino acid sequence in strands β4 and β5 and loop 3 (residues 56–75) as antigen. Rabbit polyclonal antisera to TfVEGF-A were generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N terminus of TfVEGF-A (residues 1–26). The antisera to these peptides specifically recognized TfsvVEGF and TfVEGF-A, respectively, in Western blot analysis. Rabbit polyclonal antisera generated against a synthetic peptide of the kinase insert region of human VEGFR-2 (residues 947–966) (28Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) were used for Western blot analysis, and mouse anti-Flk-1 monoclonal antibody (A-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for immunoprecipitation. Rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against the C-terminal domain of human VEGFR-1 (residues 1123–1338) (25Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar) were used for immunoprecipitation, and rabbit anti-Flt-1 polyclonal antibody (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for Western blot analysis. Rat anti-phospho-Tyr1175 monoclonal antibody was generated against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated phosphopeptide DGKDY-(PO3)IVLPI (amino acids 1171–1180 of human VEGFR-2), which was chemically synthesized (Peptide Institute). Mouse anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (C-1), goat anti-human VEGF-C polyclonal antibody, and a monoclonal antibody specific for phosphotyrosine (PY-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, R&D Systems, and BD Biosciences, respectively. Protein Purification of TfsvVEGF—Crude T. flavoviridis venom was applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and eluted at 0.5 ml/min using a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (Amersham Biosciences). Fraction A was loaded onto a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol, and the flow-through fractions were further applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 20 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The flow-through fractions were subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography with the chimeric protein VEGFR-1/Fc (R&D Systems) previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.005% Brij 35, and 0.1% CHAPS. Bound proteins were eluted from the affinity column with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.8) and immediately neutralized with 0.25 volume of 200 mm Tris (pH 9.0) and 50% glycerol. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford dye assay using protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine γ-globulin as a standard. Identification and Determination of TfsvVEGF and TfVEGF-A Se quences—A FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen) was used to extract poly(A)+ RNA from T. flavoviridis venom glands, livers, and kidneys according to the manufacturer's directions. cDNA was synthesized by primer extension using a SMART cDNA library construction kit (BD Biosciences). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers (5′-AAGTGATGCCCTTTATRRAHGTSTA-3′, 5′-TGCTGATCGAGGYCTGCATKCACA-3′, 5′-AGGCTTTCGTCGGYRCAGCADCC-3′, and 5′-ATCTTTCTTTGGYCTGCAKTCACA-3′, wherein R is A or G; H is A, T, or C; S is C or G; Y is C or T; K is T or G; and D is A, T, or G) were designed based on sequences of VEGF genes highly conserved among various species to amplify the cDNA for TfsvVEGF or TfVEGF-A. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends of the 5′-or3′-end was performed with these degenerate primers and anchor primers corresponding to the anchor sequence combined with the 3′-end of the oligo(dT) primer or the sequence involved in the 5′-end of the SMART IV oligonucleotide. The nucleotide sequences were determined using a BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI310 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Expression and Purification of Recombinant TfVEGF-A—A DNA fragment encoding TfVEGF-A was amplified by PCR using cDNA from T. flavoviridis livers and the primer set 5′-CGAATTCCGAGCAAAGAAGAGAAGGCTTAAGAG-3′ and 5′-GTGAAAAACCGAGGCGGCATCATCACCATCACCATTGAGCGGCCGCGAGCAGCCTT-3′, containing an EcoRI restriction site in the forward primer and six histidines as well as a NotI restriction site in the reverse primer. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA containing the TfVEGF166-His insert was digested with EcoRI and NotI enzymes. The excised insert was subcloned in the same site on the multicloning region of pVL1393 (Invitrogen), resulting in the pVL1393-TfVEGF166-His construct. Correct cloning was confirmed by sequencing. This transfer vector DNA was used for cotransfection into Sf9 cells along with the linearized baculovirus DNA BaculoGold (BD Biosciences) by calcium phosphate transfection. Amplification of the recombinant viruses and protein expression were carried out as described previously (29Kiba A. Yabana N. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13453-13461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The supernatant (150 ml) of cells infected with the TfVEGF166-His recombinant virus was collected, concentrated, and applied to a HisTrap HP column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole (pH 7.4). Bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole (pH 7.4); further concentrated; and buffer-exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline and 10% glycerol. The protein concentration was determined as described above. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectral analysis of the purified protein was performed as described previously (30Kobayashi M. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara-Kanda A. Ihara S. Fukui Y. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Proteins were identified by comparing the molecular masses determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry with theoretical peptide masses from the deduced amino acid sequence determined previously. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Poly(A)+ RNA from various T. flavoviridis organs was extracted with a FastTrack 2.0 kit and reverse-transcribed using a modified oligo(dT) primer and PowerScript reverse transcriptase (BD Biosciences). PCR was performed using the primer set for the TfsvVEGF gene (5′-TGGCAGTTGCCATCCTCTTCTGCATC-3′ and 5′-ACAAAGGGGAACCTGGCTCTCGG-3′) or the TfVEGF-A gene (5′-ATGAACTTTCTGCTCACTTGGATCC-3′ and 5′-TCACCGCCTCGGTTTTTCACATCT-3′). RNA levels were standardized to the T. flavoviridis β-actin gene. Endothelial Cell Growth Assay—The human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation assay was carried out as described previously (14Ogawa S. Oku A. Sawano A. Yamaguchi S. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31273-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Cell numbers were determined using a CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) according to the manufactur er's directions. Rat liver SE cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well on 24-well collagen-coated plates. About six hours later, the medium was replaced with HuMedia-EG2 medium supplemented with aliquots of each fraction separated by FPLC or with VEGF165 or TfsvVEGF, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Cell numbers were determined as described above. Vascular Permeability Assay—The Miles assay in guinea pigs was performed as described previously (14Ogawa S. Oku A. Sawano A. Yamaguchi S. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31273-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The Miles assay in mice was performed as follows. Twelve-week-old female BALB/c mice (wild-type or VEGFR-1 tyrosine kinase-deficient homozygous (VEGFR-1TK-/-)) were shaved, and 100 μl of 1% Evans blue solution was injected in the tail vein. After 30 min, 100 ng of growth factor in 40 μl of phosphate-buffered saline was given by intradermal injection into the mid-dorsum. Thirty minutes later, the skin was removed, cleaned of connective tissues, and photographed. The amount of dye extracted from the skin with formamide was quantitated by spectrophotometry at 620 nm. Ligand Binding and Competition Assay—For soluble receptor binding, TfsvVEGF, TfVEGF166, human VEGF165, or VEGF-C was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with receptor/Fc chimeric proteins (R&D Systems) previously conjugated to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitated proteins were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was incubated with specific antibodies, and visualization was achieved with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The cell-surface receptor competition assay was performed as described previously (14Ogawa S. Oku A. Sawano A. Yamaguchi S. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31273-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Heparin Affinity Chromatography—TfsvVEGF was applied to a HisTrap Heparin HP column previously equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) and 150 mm NaCl. The column was washed with the same buffer, and the bound material was eluted by applying a linear NaCl gradient from 0.15 to 1.15 m at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using an FPLC system. Fractions (1 ml each) were collected and analyzed for the presence of TfsvVEGF by Western blotting with anti-TfsvVEGF antibody. Immunodetection of VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 Phosphorylation—For in vivo phosphorylation, cells were starved overnight in 0.1% serum-containing medium and stimulated at 37 °C with various concentrations of TfsvVEGF or VEGF165 for 5 min. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and clarified by centrifugation as described previously (26Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were mixed gently with the primary antibody conjugated to protein A or G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. The precipitated proteins were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies as described above. Protein Purification and Determination of the Entire cDNA Sequence of TfsvVEGF—To clarify the molecular basis of the bleeding caused by T. flavoviridis envenomation, we investigated the effect of T. flavoviridis venom on angiogenesis and vascular permeability. During an investigation of the biological activity of T. flavoviridis venom for blood vessel structures, we found a protein that induced vascular hyperpermeability and the proliferation of primary SE cells. We purified this protein by FPLC using Superdex 200, Mono S, and Mono Q columns and the VEGFR-1 ligand-binding domain (Fig. 1, A–D) because we found that it was able to induce tyrosine autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and to bind soluble VEGFR-1 (data not shown). The purified protein was obtained with a yield of ∼0.01% from total venom and migrated as three bands upon SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1E). After determining the entire sequence of the TfsvVEGF gene using the degenerate PCR method and venom gland cDNA (Fig. 2A), we analyzed each purified protein corresponding to the three bands by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and found that all three purified proteins were identical and that they were really encoded by the TfsvVEGF gene. We further confirmed that the protein was TfsvVEGF using anti-TfsvVEGF antibody (Fig. 1E). TfsvVEGF was found to be a dimer composed of two subunits of ∼12–14 kDa (Fig. 1E) with no basic domain and showed 52% identity to human VEGF-A (Fig. 3A). All eight cysteine residues of the central cysteine knot motif characteristic of the VEGF family proteins were completely conserved in TfsvVEGF (Fig. 3A). The N-linked glycosylation site present in both human VEGF-A and TfVEGF-A (Fig. 3A) was absent in TfsvVEGF. Moreover, we could not obtain any evidence for O-glycosylation of TfsvVEGF (data not shown).Fig. 2Complete nucleotide sequences of TfsvVEGF (A) and TfVEGF-A (VEGF166) (B) cDNAs and their deduced proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Comparison of TfsvVEGF and TfVEGF-A.A, alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of TfsvVEGF, TfVEGF-A, and human VEGF-A.

Among the six splice variants of human VEGF-A, VEGF121, VEGF165, and VEGF189 are considered to be the major isoforms. Here, we identified three major isoforms of TfVEGF-A, TfVEGF122, TfVEGF166, and TfVEGF190, and revealed that they are conserved even in the T. flavoviridis Habu snake. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis using RNA from various T. flavoviridis tissues demonstrated that the TfVEGF-A gene was expressed in most of the tissues, but the TfsvVEGF gene was restricted to the venom gland (Fig. 3B). A phylogenetic tree of representative VEGF cDNA sequences revealed that the svVEGF gene is distinct from the VEGF-A gene (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the T. flavoviridis Habu snake utilizes at least two different VEGF-like molecules (TfsvVEGF and TfVEGF-A) for different purposes, one as a toxin and the other for normal angiogenesis. T. flavoviridis Venom Contains TfsvVEGF in Much More Abundant Amounts than TfVEGF-A—Since the expression of the TfVEGF-A gene was relatively higher in the venom gland than in other organs (Fig. 3B), we examined whether TfVEGF-A, in addition to TfsvVEGF, is present i"
https://openalex.org/W2019645182,"Acetyl:succinate CoA-transferase (ASCT) is an acetate-producing enzyme shared by hydrogenosomes, mitochondria of trypanosomatids, and anaerobically functioning mitochondria. The gene encoding ASCT in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei was identified as a new member of the CoA transferase family. Its assignment to ASCT activity was confirmed by 1) a quantitative correlation of protein expression and activity upon RNA interference-mediated repression, 2) the absence of activity in homozygous Δasct/Δasct knock out cells, 3) mitochondrial colocalization of protein and activity, 4) increased activity and acetate excretion upon transgenic overexpression, and 5) depletion of ASCT activity from lysates upon immunoprecipitation. Genetic ablation of ASCT produced a severe growth phenotype, increased glucose consumption, and excretion of β-hydroxybutyrate and pyruvate, indicating accumulation of acetyl-CoA. Analysis of the excreted end products of 13C-enriched and 14C-labeled glucose metabolism showed that acetate excretion was only slightly reduced. Adaptation to ASCT deficiency, however, was an infrequent event at the population level, indicating the importance of this enzyme. These studies show that ASCT is indeed involved in acetate production, but is not essential, as apparently it is not the only enzyme that produces acetate in T. brucei.

These studies show that ASCT is indeed involved in acetate production, but is not essential, as apparently it is not the only enzyme that produces acetate in T. brucei. Acetyl:succinate CoA-transferase (ASCT) 1The abbreviations used are: ASCT, acetyl:succinate CoA-transferase; BSD, blasticidin; BLE, phleomycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi, RNA interference; wt, wild type. is an enzyme that transfers the CoA moiety of acetyl-CoA to succinate, yielding acetate and succinyl-CoA. ASCT was earlier characterized as an acetate-producing activity in Trypanosomatidae (1Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Trypanosomatidae are the earliest branching eukaryotes that retained mitochondria. They belong to the order Kinetoplastida, characterized by the kinetoplast, a highly concatenated form of the genome of the single mitochondrion. These unicellular eukaryotes contain unique organelles, such as glycosomes, which harbor part of the glycolytic pathway (2Opperdoes F.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 3Hannaert V. Bringaud F. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Kinetoplastid. Biol. Dis. 2003; 2: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The energy metabolism of Trypanosomatidae is characterized by excretion of mainly partially oxidized end products like pyruvate, succinate, and acetate. All of the Trypanosomatidae investigated produce acetate to a certain extent during their life cycle (4Cazzulo J.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 5Blum J.J. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 9: 118-122Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Opperdoes F.R. Marr J.M. London A. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites.

Parasitology. 1997; 114: 351-360Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but the amount of acetate produced differs widely depending on the species and the stage of development. Trypanosoma brucei, one of the causative agents of African trypanosomiasis, alternates during its life cycle between the bloodstream of its mammalian host and the blood-feeding tsetse insect vector Glossina spp. In the mammalian bloodstream long slender-form parasites proliferate. At the peak of parasitemia, nonproliferative short stumpy cells develop that are prepared to differentiate to procyclic insect stage parasites. The long slender stage depends entirely on glycolysis for energy generation and excretes pyruvate as the main end product of carbohydrate metabolism (8Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 9Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 10Clayton C. Michels P.A. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 465-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The procyclic stage, on the other hand, can also use amino acids for its energy generation, and its glucose metabolism is completely reorganized, with succinate and acetate as main end products. Recently it was shown that inside the glycosome succinate is produced by a soluble fumarate reductase (11Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the procyclic stage the mitochondrion is directly involved in the degradation of substrates, in contrast to the situation in the long slender bloodstream stage. Pyruvate enters the mitochondrion and is converted by pyruvate dehydrogenase into acetyl-CoA. This acetyl-CoA is not degraded to carbon dioxide via the Krebs cycle but is converted into acetate by ASCT (1Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Van Weelden S.W. Fast B. Vogt A. Van Der Meer P. Saas J. Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The ASCT reaction concomitantly produces succinyl-CoA, which is recycled to succinate by succinyl-CoA synthetase, an enzyme that also forms part of the Krebs cycle and produces ATP. ASCT activity is also known to occur in the anaerobically functioning mitochondria of metazoa that produce acetate, such as parasitic helminths like Fasciola hepatica and Ascarissuum (13Saz H.J. deBruyn B. de Mata Z. J. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 694-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14McLaughlin G.L. Saz H.J. deBruyn B.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1986; 83: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ASCT is also a key enzyme in the metabolism of a wide spectrum of anaerobic protists, including ciliates such as Nyctotherus ovalis, chytridiomycete fungi such as Neocallimastix, and parabasalids such as Trichomonas vaginalis (15Steinbuchel A. Muller M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Marvin-Sikkema F.D. Pedro Gomes T.M. Grivet J.P. Gottschal J.C. Prins R.A. Arch.

Evol. 2000; 17: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In these protists ASCT is located inside their hydrogenosomes, anaerobic energy-generating organelles. Hydrogenosomes are H2-producing, membrane-enclosed organelles related to mitochondria, and they evolved independently in the various protists (18Embley T.M. Finlay B.J. Dyal P.L. Hirt R.P. Wilkinson M. Williams A.G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1995; 262: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Cavalier-Smith T. Chao E.E. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of several organelle-specific heat shock proteins or chaperonins and the presence of targeting signals at the N terminus of hydrogenosomal enzymes that resemble mitochondrial import signals showed that hydrogenosomes and mitochondria are evolutionary related (20Bui E.T. Bradley P.J. Johnson P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9651-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21Germot A. Philippe H. Le Guyader H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 14618-14622Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). They probably originated from the same prokaryotic endosymbiont of the α group of proteobacteria, and it is suggested that hydrogenosomes have evolved by adaptation to anaerobic conditions (24Martin W. Muller M. Nature. 1998; 392: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The exact evolutionary relation between mitochondria and the various types of hydrogenosomes is, however, still debated. Although the main function in energy generation of both mitochondria and hydrogenosomes is the oxidation of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, the two types of organelles do not share many similarities. The ASCT/succinyl-CoA synthetase cycle is the only metabolic pathway common to mitochondria and hydrogenosomes (1Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For that reason, phylogenetic analysis of ASCTs from different sources could provide a valuable tool to unravel the evolutionary history of the respective energy-generating organelles, the various types of hydrogenosomes, and (an)aerobically functioning mitochondria. Unfortunately, the sequence of not a single ASCT gene is known yet. Here we have identified the gene encoding ASCT of T. brucei. Several reverse genetic strategies and subcellular localization studies were used to establish the link between ASCT gene sequence and mitochondrial ASCT enzyme activity. Furthermore, two independent methods of metabolic analysis using 13C-enriched and 14C-labeled glucose were applied to wild type and transgenic mutant clones of T. brucei. The combined biochemical and genetic approach resulted in the gene identification of T. brucei ASCT and also demonstrated that this enzyme is indeed involved in acetate production. However, ASCT is not an essential gene as ASCT is not the only enzyme producing acetate in T. brucei. Plasmid Constructs—The sheared DNA clone 7D10 from The Institute for Genomic Research (GenBank™ accessions AQ652285 and AQ652287) was obtained from Dr. Najib M. A. El-Sayed. The complete sequence of that part of chromosome 11 is now available from the TrypDB genome data base (Tb11.02.0290); it is identical with results of sequencing of clone 7D10. A MluI (blunted)/MscI fragment of the insert of 7D10 was excised and replaced in the reading frame orientation by a blasticidin S resistance BSD (25Kimura M. Takatsuki A. Yamaguchi I. Biochim.

Before transfection, the targeting vectors were linearized with BsrGI plus BsmI. To produce double-stranded RNA using head-to-head promoters, the N-terminal fragment of the T. brucei ASCT (nucleotides position 35 to position 665) was PCR-amplified from 7D10 and inserted into p2T7 (27LaCount D.J.

For overexpression in T. brucei, the complete ASCT-coding region was assembled from a N-terminal PCR product amplified from T. brucei 927/4 genomic DNA with the primers 5′-ggcagaattcCAGCTCCACATCACCTTCCAGG (EcoRI site) and 5′actgaagcttATGCTCCGCCGAACAAATTTT (HindIII site) and from a C-terminal fragment excised from plasmid 7D10 digested with EcoRI and BamHI.

Parasitol. 1996; 82: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The EATRO1125-T7T and the stock 427 derived 29-13 clone 6 procyclic cells expressing the T7 RNA polymerase gene and the tetracycline repressor under control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter are described in Bringaud et al. (28Bringaud F. Robinson D.R. Barradeau S. Biteau N. Baltz D. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and in Wirtz et al. (26Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), respectively. Trypanosome transfection and selection of drug-resistant clones were performed as previously reported (33McCulloch R. Vassella E. Burton P. Boshart M. Barry J.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 262: 53-86PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications; for washing and electroporation, cytomix was used at 4 °C, and 1 × 107 cells were electroporated. After electroporation, procyclic cells were directly cloned in 30–50% conditioned SDM79 supplemented with 5–10 μg·ml–1 phleomycin (Cayla), 10 μg·ml–1 hygromycin S (Calbiochem), or 15 μg·ml–1 hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science). For generation of clonal lines, the cells were diluted (1:100 and 1:10) in 30% conditioned SDM79 after 24 h and selected in microtiter plates. Production of Anti-ASCT Antibodies—A recombinant fragment corresponding to the first 414 amino acids of ASCT followed by a C-terminal histidine tag was expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 using the pET16b expression vector (Novagen). After 2 h of induction at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and proteins were purified by nickel chelate affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Antisera were raised in rabbits by 3 injections at 15-day intervals of 200 μg of recombinant purified protein, electro-eluted after separation on SDS-PAGE, and emulsified with complete (first injection) or incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The antiserum was affinity-purified on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane-bound recombinant protein (amino acids 12–493 fused to an N-terminal His tag in vector pQE32 (Qiagen)). Elution with 0.2 m glycine, 1 mm EGTA, pH 2.2, for 10 min was followed by immediate neutralization, stabilization in 200 μg·ml–1 bovine serum albumin, and dialysis against PBS containing 0.02% NaNO3. One specific 53-kDa band was detected on the Western blot. Western Blot and Immunofluorescence Analyses—For the Western blot analysis total protein lysates of procyclic form T. brucei (1.75 × 105 cells) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and blotted on Immobilon-P filters (Millipore) (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with PBS, 5% milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 with 1% milk powder: rabbit anti T. brucei phosphoglycerate kinase C 1:5,000; rabbit anti-T. brucei ASCT 1:500; mouse anti-T. brucei heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) 1:10,000; IRD800 goat anti-mouse IgG (Biomol) 1:5,000; Alexa 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) 1:5,000. Antibody incubations were for 1 h at room temperature. For detection, the membrane was dried and scanned with the Odyssey™ dual wavelength infrared fluorescence scanner (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). For immunofluorescence, log phase cells were fixed with formaldehyde as previously described (35Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Slides were incubated with 1:100 diluted affinity-purified rabbit anti-ASCT, and the undiluted H95 monoclonal mouse anti-hsp60 (36Bringaud F. Peyruchaud S. Baltz D. Giroud C. Simpson L. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted 1:100 (Bio-Rad) and ALEXA Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1:100 (Molecular Probes). Cells were observed with a Zeiss UV microscope, and images were captured by a MicroMax-1300Y/HS camera (Princeton Instruments) and MetaView software (Universal Imaging Corp.) and assembled in Adobe Photoshop. Digitonin Fractionations—Digitonin fractionations were done as described in Saas et al. (37Saas J. Ziegelbauer K. von Haeseler A. Fast B. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2745-2755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Proteinase K digestion was adapted from Sveshnikova et al. (38Sveshnikova N. Grimm R. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The pellet and concentrated supernatant were suspended in 500 μl of trypanosome homogenization buffer without leupeptin (37Saas J. Ziegelbauer K. von Haeseler A. Fast B. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2745-2755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and 8 μl of proteinase K (10 mg·ml–1) were added on ice. After 3 min at 37 °C the reaction was stopped by adding 6 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 mm diluted in isopropanol) on ice. For thermolysin digestion, the pellet and concentrated supernatant were suspended in 90 and 40 μl, respectively, of 0.1 m Hepes-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 μg·ml–1 leupeptin, 0.6 m saccharose, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The pellet and supernatant were incubated with 10 and 5 μl, respectively, of thermolysin (1 mg·ml–1) for 30 min at 45 °C. The digestion was stopped by adding EDTA on ice. ASCT Activity Assay—Homogenates of procyclic T. brucei were prepared from 5 × 107 cells in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 using a Teflon glass homogenizer. Subsequently, cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g, 4 °C. The activity of ASCT was determined by a radioactive assay as described previously (1Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In brief, the assay mix contained 50 mm succinate, pH 7.4, 1 mm [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (0.2 Mbq, Amersham Biosciences), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. The assay was started by the addition of the homogenate (50–100 μg protein), incubated at 20 °C for 10 min, and terminated by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v, final concentration). Reaction products were then separated by anion-exchange chromatography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Immunoprecipitation—Procyclic cells (1 × 108 cells) were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The cells were washed twice and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1% Triton X-100. Antiserum was added to the cell lysate (20% v/v) and incubated on ice for 2 h. Subsequently, protein A-conjugated acrylic beads (Sigma, 150 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, were added to the lysate and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The antigen-bead preparation was pelleted by centrifugation (500 × g for 10 s). The supernatant was collected, and the pelleted beads were washed once with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, and then resuspended in the same buffer. Both the supernatant and the resuspended beads were assayed for ASCT activity. Cell lysates treated with protein-A acrylic beads only were used as the control. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Experiments—4 × 109T. brucei procyclic cells grown in the SDM79 medium (up to 1 × 107 cells·ml–1) were incubated in 10 ml of incubation buffer (PBS buffer supplemented with 24 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.3) containing 110 μmole d-[1-13C]glucose (11 mm) for 90–180 min at 27 °C as described before (11Besteiro S.

The cell viability and motility, checked every 30 min, were not affected during the incubation time. d-Glucose concentration in the medium was determined at the beginning and the end of the incubation with the d-glucose Trinder kit (Sigma). The supernatant was lyophilized and re-dissolved in 500 μl of D2O, and 15 μl of pure dioxane was added as an external reference. 13C NMR spectra were collected as described before (11Besteiro S.

The relaxation delay was 8 s for a nearly complete longitudinal relaxation. The specific 13C enrichment of lactate (carbon C3), acetate (carbon C2), and succinate (carbons C2 and C3) was determined from 1H-observed/13C-edited NMR (1H/13C NMR) spectra acquired under 13C decoupling (40Freeman R. Mareci T.H. Morris G.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 42: 341-345Google Scholar, 41Rothman D.L. Behar K.L. Hetherington H.P. den Hollander J.A. Bendall M.R. Petroff O.A. Shulman R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49625-49635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The reproducibility and accuracy of the method were assessed using pure solutions of succinate, acetate, lactate, malate, pyruvate, or β-hydroxybutyrate; the relative errors on the 13C enrichment determinations were <5%. 2M. Biran and P. Canioni, unpublished data. The amount of 13C-enriched molecules (including d-glucose) was calculated on the basis of the dioxane peak. For each experiment, the amount of remaining d-glucose calculated from the NMR spectra corresponded ±5–25% to the concentration measured with the d-glucose Trinder kit. Metabolic Incubations—Proliferating T. brucei cells (starting at 5 × 106 ml–1) were incubated for 18–24 h at 27 °C in sealed 25-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 5 ml of SDM79 incubation medium. Before sealing, the flasks were flushed for 1 min with a gas phase of air and CO2 (95/5%). The incubations were performed after the addition of 5 μCi of d-[6-14C]glucose. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 40 μl of 6 m HCL to lower the pH to 3.5. Preceding acidification, 0.1 ml 1 m NaHCO3 was added through the rubber stopper, and the flasks were placed on ice. Immediately after acidification, the incubation flasks were flushed with nitrogen for 90 min at 0 °C. In this way all carbon dioxide was removed, whereas acetate remained in the incubation medium. The carbon dioxide was trapped in a series of four scintillation vials, each filled with 1 ml of 0.3 m NaOH and 15 ml of Tritisol scintillation fluid modified according to the method described by Pande (42Pande S.V. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 43Horemans A.M. Tielens A.G. van den Bergh S.G. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After removal of carbon dioxide, the acidified supernatant was separated from the cells by centrifugation (4 °C, 10 min at 500 × g) and neutralized by the addition of 40 μlof6 m NaOH. Analysis of the labeled end products occurred by anion-exchange chromatography on a Dowex 1X8, 100–200 mesh column (Serva), 60 × 1.1 cm in chloride form (44Tielens A.G. van der Meer P. van den Bergh S.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1981; 3: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The column was eluted successively with 200 ml of 5 mm HCl, 130 ml of 0.2 m NaCl, and 130 ml of 0.5 m NaCl. The fractions were collected and counted with 2 ml of Lumac LCS in a scintillation counter. All values were corrected for blank incubations. Labeled end products were identified by their RF values. Glucose concentrations were determined enzymatically using a standard procedure (45Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Schmidt F. Stork H. Bergmeyer H.U. Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1970: 1163-1165Google Scholar). Protein was determined with a Lowry method using defatted and dialyzed bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science) as the standard (46Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Identification of an ASCT Candidate Gene—The transfer of the coenzyme A (CoA) group is catalyzed by a large family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic CoA transferases (47Heider J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that share conserved protein domains (CoA_trans in protein families data base, accession PF01144) and have a broad range of substrate specificities. Acetoacetate, a preferred substrate of mammalian succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase, is structurally comparable with acetate, the substrate of ASCT. Therefore, we first searched for succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase-related gene sequences in the available T. brucei genome databases using BLAST. Only a single high scoring segment pair was identified, and the target shares up to 55% amino acid identity over its full length with succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase from several vertebrate species. A single copy (see Fig. 3 and data not shown) of this gene maps to chromosome 11 of the T. brucei genome reference strain TREU 927/4 (see TrypDB, release 2.1, systematic name Tb1102.0290). The gene encodes a 53-kDa protein (493 amino acids) with two CoA transferase domains in tandem, the hallmark of eukaryotic CoA transferases (48Bateman K.S. Brownie E.R. Wolodko W.T. Fraser M.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14455-14462Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All nine amino acids found in immediate proximity of the catalytic center in the crystal structure of porcine succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase (48Bateman K.S. Brownie E.R. Wolodko W.T.

https://openalex.org/W2100653816,"The light reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis are mediated by multisubunit pigment-protein complexes situated within the specialized thylakoid membrane system. The biogenesis of these complexes is regulated by transacting factors that affect the expression of the respective subunit genes and/or the assembly of their products. Here we report on the analysis of the PratA gene from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that encodes a periplasmic tetratricopeptide repeat protein of formerly unknown function. Targeted inactivation of PratA resulted in drastically reduced photosystem II (PSII) content. Protein pulse labeling experiments of PSII subunits indicated that the C-terminal processing of the precursor of the reaction center protein D1 is compromised in the pratA mutant. Moreover, a direct interaction of PratA and precursor D1 was demonstrated by applying yeast two-hybrid analyses. This suggests that PratA represents a factor facilitating D1 maturation via the endoprotease CtpA.

The light-driven reactions of photosynthesis take place at a specialized membrane system, the thylakoids, that contains the essential protein complexes mediating photosynthetic electron transport, which include photosystem II (PSII), 1The abbreviations used are: PSII, photosystem II; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; ORF, open reading frame; PratA, processing-associated tetratricopeptide repeat protein; BN, blue native; RC, reaction center; pD1, precursor D1.1The abbreviations used are: PSII, photosystem II; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; ORF, open reading frame; PratA, processing-associated tetratricopeptide repeat protein; BN, blue native; RC, reaction center; pD1, precursor D1. the cytb6f complex, PSI, and the ATPase. Although the structural and functional features of these complexes have been analyzed in great detail, to date relatively little is known about their regulated biogenesis during cell development. Recent work on vascular plants, eukaryotic algae, and cyanobacteria revealed that numerous regulatory factors exist that are involved in the expression of genes encoding subunits of the photosynthetic membrane complexes and/or their assembly (1Barkan A. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 2Nickelsen J. Prog. Bot. 2003; 64: 53-73Crossref Google Scholar). These factors apparently constitute an intracellular communication system that mediates the controlled biogenesis of thylakoids. Among these, one subgroup is represented by so-called tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins, which share a degenerate protein-protein interaction motif consisting of multiple repeats of 34 amino acids (3Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 4Blatch G.L. Lassle M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). For instance, TPR motifs have been found in factors that are involved in the stabilization of chloroplast mRNAs (5Boudreau E. Takahashi Y. Lemieux C. Turmel M. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 6Vaistij F.E. Boudreau E. Lemaire S.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2127-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), whereas the chloroplast TPR protein Ycf3 is involved in the assembly of PSI (8Boudreau E. Nickelsen J. Lemaire S.D. Ossenbuhl F. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3366-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Ruf S. Kossel H. Bock R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria, the structurally related Ycf37 protein was also shown to affect PSI levels (10Wilde A. Lunser K. Ossenbuhl F. Nickelsen J. Borner T. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the open reading frame (ORF) sll0886 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis 6803) encodes a TPR protein that is required for light-activated heterotrophic growth (11Kong R. Xu X. Hu Z. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 219: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the TPR motif might play an important role in the organization/function of regulatory units in both cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells. In addition to the structure and function of this regulatory machinery, the localization of the different biogenesis steps remains an intriguing, still unresolved matter. Current evidence supports a model of an intraorganellar vesicle transport system for chloroplasts (12Kroll D. Meierhoff K. Bechtold N. Kinoshita M. Westphal S. Vothknecht U.C. Soll J. Westhoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4238-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13Zerges W. Rochaix J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The idea of a specialized region where the biogenesis of photosynthetic membrane complexes takes place and that is spatially separated from the thylakoid membrane was further strongly supported by the recent observation that significant amounts of some PSII and PSI subunits are detectable in the plasma membrane of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 where they form chlorophyll-containing precomplexes (14Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These data led to the hypothesis that the initial steps of cyanobacterial photosystem assembly may occur at the plasma membrane and not at the thylakoids (14Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). One of these complexes, namely PSII, contains more than 25 subunits, which assemble in a highly coordinated fashion. The initial steps of this assembly include the formation of a dimer of the reaction center proteins D2 and D1 and the subsequent binding of Cytb559, PsbI, CP47, and CP43 (15Baena-Gonzalez E. Aro E.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Much attention has been focused on the D1 protein (16Zhang L. Aro E.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which is synthesized as a precursor (pD1) with an extension of 8–16 amino acids at its C terminus. The removal of this extension by a specific endoprotease called CtpA (C-terminal processing protease) represents an essential step of PSII biogenesis (17Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8082-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In ctpA mutants, the unprocessed pD1 precursor, though it is incorporated into a PSII complex, impairs the assembly of the manganese cluster of the oxygen-evolving complex of PSII (18Bowyer J.R.

Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), leading to a photosynthesis-deficient phenotype. Because site-directed mutants of the corresponding psbA gene lacking the C-terminal extension were shown to grow at wild-type rates (20Lers A. Heifetz P.B. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Osmond C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17494-17497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the precise function of the C-terminal extension still remains elusive. However, long-term growth of mutant and wild-type strains of Synechocystis 6803 in mixed culture conditions indicated that the C-terminal extension might provide a selective advantage on cells, possibly by protecting D1 during integration into the membrane or PSII (21Ivleva N.B. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that ORF slr2048 from Synechocystis 6803 encodes a periplasmic TPR protein named PratA (processing associated TPR protein) that is involved in the C-terminal processing of the pD1 protein. The finding that PratA directly interacts with pD1 supports the recently proposed model of a plasma membrane-localized biogenesis of cyanobacterial photosystems (14Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Strains and Growth Conditions—Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 wild-type and mutant strains were grown on solid or in liquid BG 11 medium (22Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdmann M. Stanier R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) at 30 °C at a continuous photon irradiance of 100 μE m–2 s–1. Plasmid Constructions, Transformations, and Complementation— The PratA gene was cloned after its PCR amplification with oligonucleotides 2048–5, CCATGGCAAGCCGTCCCTTGG, and 2048–3, CTAGAGATTATCCAGCTT, and insertion of the resulting fragment into the Bluescript pKS vector (Stratagene). A XbaI fragment from plasmid pBSL86 (23Alexeyev M.F. BioTechniques. 1995; 18 (54, 56): 52PubMed Google Scholar) containing a kanamycin resistance cartridge was inserted into the single NheI site within PratA. This construct was transformed into Synechocystis 6803 as described (10Wilde A. Lunser K. Ossenbuhl F. Nickelsen J. Borner T. Biochem.

For complementation of the pratA mutant, the PratA gene including its own promoter was PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides 2048a, CTCGAGTGGAAGCCTACGAACGTTCCG, and 2048b, GCCAGACCAATGCTTGCTGACTCGAG, and cloned into the single XhoI site of the vector pVZ321 that is capable of autonomous replication in Synechocystis 6803 (24Zinchenko V.V. Piven I.P. Melnik V.A. Shestakov S.V. Russ. J. Genet. 1999; 35: 228-232Google Scholar). Conjugal transfer of this construct into pratA was performed as described (24Zinchenko V.V. Piven I.P. Melnik V.A. Shestakov S.V. Russ. J. Genet. 1999; 35: 228-232Google Scholar). Southern, Northern, and Western Blot Analysis—Total cyanobacterial DNA was isolated from 50-ml cultures by using the Qiagen DNeasy plant kit. Southern blot analysis was carried out using standard protocols. Isolation of total RNA, electrophoresis, and gel blotting was performed as described (10Wilde A. Lunser K. Ossenbuhl F. Nickelsen J. Borner T. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The PratA gene was inserted into the expression vector pCAL-n. Recombinant PratA protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified following the instructions of the affinity protein expression and purification system from Stratagene. The αPratA antiserum was raised in rabbits (Biogenes). Protein preparation from Synechocystis 6803 and Western analysis was performed as previously reported (10Wilde A. Lunser K. Ossenbuhl F. Nickelsen J. Borner T. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Isolation of periplasmic proteins was performed as described (25Fulda S. Mikkat S. Schroder W. Hagemann M. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Measurements of Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Oxygen Evolution— The ratio of maximum and minimum chlorophyll fluorescence (FM/F0) was assayed as described (26Berry S. Schneider D. Vermaas W.F. Rogner M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3422-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K were measured with a SLM-Aminco Series 2 luminescence spectrometer (excitation at 435 nm, slid width 4 nm for excitation and detection). Cell suspensions in BG11 medium were mixed with 30% (v/v) glycerol. Pigment content was determined with a Beckmann DU 7400 spectrometer. Measurements of oxygen evolution during illumination with saturating white light were done with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Bachofer) at 30 °C. Cells were suspended at an OD750 = 1 in 2 ml of BG11 medium, supplemented with 10 mm NaHCO3. Pulse-Chase Labeling of Cyanobacterial Cells, Preparation of Total Membranes, and Gel Electrophoresis—Cells grown at 100 μE m–2 s–1 for 15 h in the late exponential growth phase (2–4 μg of chlorophyll/ml) were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in fresh BG11 to a concentration of 0.3 μg/μl; chlorophyll [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was added (final activity 750 μCiml–1). The cell suspension was incubated at 60 μE m–2 s–1 for 20 min at 30 °C. Thereafter, harvested cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were thawed on ice, washed twice in TMK buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl) and resuspended in 250 μl of TMK buffer. 0.3 g of glass beads were added, and cells were broken by vortexing two times for 1 min with an intermediate cooling on ice for at least 2 min. Unbroken cells were removed by differential centrifugation. Sedimented total membranes were resuspended in ACA buffer (750 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm Bistris, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA). Total membranes corresponding to 10 μg of chlorophyll in ACA buffer were solubilized by adding β-dodecylmaltoside to a final concentration of 1.0% for 10 min on ice. Non-solubilized material was removed by centrifugation, and 5 μl of loading buffer (750 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250) was added to the supernatant prior to loading the blue native (BN) 6–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels. BN gel electrophoresis was performed at 12 mA constant current as described (27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). For the second dimension (so called two-dimensional-BN/SDS gels), a single lane of the BN gel was solubilized in solubilization buffer (66 mm Na2CO3, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) and loaded on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 4 M urea. The two-dimensional BN/SDS gels were run overnight at 16 mA constant current and 15 °C. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R, dried, and exposed to phosphorimaging plates (Fuji Photo Film GmbH). The imaging plates were read out with a FLA3000 image reader and quantified with the supplied AIDA software (raytest Isotopenmessgeräte GmbH). For the measurement of chlorophyll concentrations, cells were sedimented by centrifugation and extracted with 100% methanol. The concentration of chlorophyll was calculated from the absorbance values of the extract at 666 and 720 nm (28Wellburn A.R. Lichtenthaler H.K. Sybesma C. Advances in Photosynthesis Research. II. Martinus Nijhoff/Dr. W. Junk Publishers, The Hague, Lancaster, Boston1984: 9-12Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—For the two-hybrid analysis, the system MATCHMARKER LexA (Clontech), with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 (MATα, ura3, trp1, his3, lexAop(x6)-LEU2) transformed with the plasmid pSH18–34 (29Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), and the plasmids pEG202 and pJG4–5 (30Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar) were used. The PratA gene fragment was amplified by the oligonucleotides TH2048a2, GAATTCATGAATTTACGCTACCTCTG, and TH2048b, CTCGAGCTAGAGATTATCCAGCTTTTCTTG, and cloned into the yeast shuttle vector pJG4–5 via the oligonucleotide-derived restriction sites EcoRI and XhoI. This construct did not contain the signal peptide sequence for localization in the periplasm. The pD1 C terminus was amplified with the oligonucleotides ThpsbAa, GAATTCATGGCGTTCAACCTGAACGG, and ThpsbAb, CTCGAGTTAACCGTTGACAGCAGGAG, and cloned into pEG202 via the oligonucleotide-derived restriction sites EcoRI and XhoI. The pD1 C terminus comprises 68 amino acids, including its 16-amino acid extension. Generation and Characterization of a pratA Mutant—Computer-assisted similarity searches revealed that the genome of Synechocystis 6803 harbors a total of 22 ORFs encoding putative TPR proteins. During the course of a systematic mutagenesis study of these ORFs, we analyzed slr2048, which encodes a protein of 398 amino acids that is capable of forming nine TPR repeats. Based on this study, the gene was named PratA (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, a transit sequence was predicted at the N terminus of the derived protein that would allow secretion of the protein via the Sec system (Fig. 1A). Indeed, PratA was identified within the periplasm of Synechocystis 6803 by Fulda et al. (31Fulda S. Huang F. Nilsson F. Hagemann M. Norling B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5900-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) during a proteomic analysis. We disrupted the cloned PratA gene by inserting a kanamycin resistance cassette into the single NheI site 379 bp down-stream of its translation start codon (Fig. 1B). After subsequent transformation of wild-type cells with this construct, resulting transformants were tested for complete segregation of the mutation by applying Southern blot hybridizations (Fig. 1C) and PCR analyses (data not shown). Northern analysis confirmed that no PratA mRNA was present in the segregated pratA mutant strain (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the detection of only one single signal at 1,300 nucleotides indicated a monocistronic transcription of the gene, because cotranscription with either of the adjacent reading frames, slr2047 or slr2049, would have resulted in transcripts with a minimum size of 2,400 or 1,900 nucleotides, respectively. Thus, it is likely that disruption of the PratA gene has no polar effects on the expression of these genes. The absence of the PratA protein in the mutant was confirmed by Western analysis using an αPratA antiserum raised against the recombinant protein expressed in E. coli (Fig. 2B). Finally, the periplasmic localization of PratA was verified after analyzing cellular subfractions of Synechocystis 6803. As shown in Fig. 2B, a signal at the expected size of 35 kDa (31Fulda S. Huang F. Nilsson F. Hagemann M. Norling B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5900-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) was detected in proteins from total cells and in the periplasmic subfraction (Fig. 2B, T and P). No signal was obtained in the protein fraction from cells that had been separated from their periplasm (Fig. 2B, –P). In contrast, the cytoplasmic ribosomal protein S1 was found in the –P but not in the P fraction, indicating that the periplasmic proteins are free of substantial cytoplasmic contaminants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the vast majority of PratA is located in the periplasm. The photoautotrophic growth rate of pratA was reduced by more than 4-fold when compared with the wild-type, whereas the chlorophyll content was found to be similar in both strains after comparative analysis of absorption spectra (data not shown). When fluorescence emission spectra at low temperature (77 K) from both wild-type and pratA were measured, a drastic decrease of chlorophyll emission peaks from PSII at 685 and 695 nm was observed in the mutant, suggesting a lower relative PSII content (Fig. 3). This reduced PSII amount was confirmed by the finding that the ratio of maximum and minimum chlorophyll fluorescence (FM/F0) was significantly reduced in pratA compared with the wild-type (data not shown). Moreover, photosynthetic oxygen production in pratA was reduced to 25% of that of the wild-type rate, again suggesting a considerable effect on PSII content/activity. To calculate the PSII amount in pratA, Western analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 4A, the steady state levels of the PSII subunits PsbB, D1, and PsbO in pratA were reduced to ∼45, 15, and 10% of that of the wild-type amount, respectively. This suggests a more direct effect of PratA on D1 and PsbO accumulation. In contrast, both the level of the PSI subunit PsaD and the Rubisco enzyme were not or were only slightly affected, indicating that only the amount of PSII is affected in the mutant. In chloroplasts of eukaryotic algae and vascular plants, TPR proteins have been shown to be required for gene-specific RNA stabilization processes. Thus, we tested whether the RNA levels of various genes encoding PSII subunits are compromised in pratA (Fig. 4B). Obviously, this was not the case for either psbA and psbO mRNAs or for psbB, psbC, and psbD transcripts. These data allow the conclusion that PratA functions in the synthesis and/or the stability of PSII subunits. PratA Is Involved in D1 Maturation—To distinguish between these two possibilities of PratA function, protein pulse-labeling experiments with radioactive [35S] methionine were carried out. Radiolabeled proteins were first separated by BN-PAGE to resolve native protein complexes and then, in a second dimension, by SDS-PAGE to elucidate their subunit composition (Fig. 5A). The identity of different proteins was determined through comparison of two-dimensional-BN/SDS-PAGE analyses of pulse-labeling experiments using deletion mutants of the PSII subunits D1, D2, CP43, and CP47. 2J. Komenda, V. Reisinger, B. C. Müller, M. Dobáková, and L. A. Eichacker, submitted for publication. During pulse labeling of Synechocystis 6803 proteins, PSII subunits and especially the reaction center protein D1 were predominantly labeled independent of the growth conditions used (33Herranen M. Battchikova N. Zhang P. Graf A. Sirpio S. Paakkarinen V. Aro E.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This reflects the active synthesis of PSII and highlights in particular the D1 protein, which is subject to extensive photo damage and, thus, must be constantly repaired via the PSII repair cycle. In wild-type cells, several different intermediates of the PSII assembly process could be visualized. Both the precursor and the mature D1 protein were detected in the early PSII intermediates RCa, RCb, and RC47 (Fig. 5A), whereas the PSII monomer RCC (1) and bigger complexes contained the C-terminal-processed, mature D1 form alone. In the mutant pratA, the synthesis rates of the PSII components were the same as those of the wild-type, indicating that the mutation affects the stability and not the synthesis of the PSII complex. Furthermore, in pratA PSII appears to be assembled because most intermediate PSII complexes were detectable except for the early precomplexes RCa and RCb (Fig. 5A). However, the main difference between wild-type and pratA was the almost complete absence of mature D1 protein in the mutant. This was verified by performing one-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse-labeled proteins (Fig. 5B). As a control, the strain repratA was generated in which, via conjugation, the wild-type PratA gene including its promoter was reintroduced into the mutant on an autonomously replicating plasmid (24Zinchenko V.V. Piven I.P. Melnik V.A. Shestakov S.V. Russ. J. Genet. 1999; 35: 228-232Google Scholar). The resulting revertant displayed a rescued phenotype with a photoautotrophic growth rate nearly at the wild-type level. In addition, 77-K fluorescence emission spectra indicated a significantly higher PSII/PSI ratio in repratA compared with the mutant (Fig. 3). The incomplete restoration of the wild-type phenotype is probably a result of the extrachromosomal expression of PratA in the revertant. Consistent with the restored phenotype, efficient C-terminal D1 processing occurred in repratA (Fig. 5B). The ratio of D1 maturation, though, appeared to be slightly reduced. In contrast to the wild-type, in the intermediate PSII monomer most D1 was still present in the precursor form, which was processed only during later PSII assembly steps (Fig. 5A). Taken together, the pulse-labeling data indicate that the PratA protein is involved in the C-terminal processing of the D1 protein. As a consequence, the water-splitting apparatus would not be able to correctly dock to PSII, thereby explaining the observed phenotype of the pratA mutant. PratA Interacts with the C Terminus of D1—To this end, the obtained results direct us to the question whether PratA interacts directly with the D1 protein and/or the D1 C-terminal protease CtpA. To test this, we applied a yeast two-hybrid analysis that is based on the LexA system. PCR fragments containing the PratA and CtpA genes as well as a fragment encoding the C-terminal 68 amino acids of pD1 were cloned into shuttle vectors pEG202 or pJG4–5. This resulted in translational fusions of the proteins with the LexA-DNA binding domain or the B42 activation domain, respectively. It is important to note that the cloned pD1 C terminus did not harbor any hydrophobic transmembrane regions that could have possibly disturbed the two-hybrid assay by affecting nuclear import of the fusion protein in the yeast system. As shown in Fig. 6, indeed, an interaction between PratA fused to the activation domain and the pD1 C terminus fused to the DNA binding domain was detected by analyzing the expression of the lacZ and LEU2 reporter genes. No reporter gene activity was observed in a negative control experiment in which the constructs were assayed alone (Fig. 6). This indicated that both PratA and pD1 are required for complex formation. A putative interaction of PratA with the protease CtpA could not be analyzed in this system, because CtpA expressed in yeast was shown to impair the import of fusion proteins into the nucleus of yeast cells where reporter gene activity is regulated (data not shown). This might be because CtpA, though its nature appears hydrophilic, might be membrane-associated. Indeed, it has been reported to be tightly associated with the plasma membrane in Synechocystis 6803 (14Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Hence, future work will focus on the establishment of alternative two-hybrid systems that should allow the analysis of membrane proteins (34Thaminy S. Miller J. Stagljar I. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 297-312PubMed Google Scholar) to answer the question whether or not PratA also recognizes CtpA. Nevertheless, the sensitive two-hybrid LexA system enabled us to identify a direct interaction of the TPR protein PratA with the C terminus of the PSII reaction center protein pD1. In this study, we report on the characterization of the ORF slr2048 from Synechocystis 6803, which encodes the periplasmic TPR protein PratA. The insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette into the PratA gene resulted in a significant reduction of the PSII content in the mutant and an apparent absence of the C-terminal processing of the pD1 protein. This phenotype resembles the one of a CtpA deletion mutant (ΔctpA), which contains no C-terminal processing D1 protease CtpA (17Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8082-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to ΔctpA, pratA was still able to grow photoautotrophically though with a 4-fold reduced rate. This might explain why no significant accumulation of pD1 was detectable in pratA in Western analysis, but only in pulse-labeling experiments (Fig. 4A). Because N-terminal parts of the PratA gene providing partial activity might still be expressed in the mutant, we recently constructed a site-directed, completely segregated mutant in which the complete ORF slr2048 is deleted. In this mutant, the photoautotrophic growth rate incurred even a 10-fold reduction when compared with the wild-type, but residual photosynthetic activity was still observed. This suggests that PratA is involved, but not mandatory, for D1 maturation. Most likely, it facilitates the CtpA-mediated processing event. Interestingly, such an assisting, additional component for pD1 processing has recently been proposed for spinach chloroplasts, based on the finding that CtpA exhibits a relatively weak affinity to its substrate in vitro (35Yamamoto Y. Inagaki N. Satoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7518-7525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate whether PratA might represent an assisting factor in Synechocystis 6803. Computer-assisted BLASTP homology searches revealed several ORFs with similarity to PratA in various cyanobacteria. Among these, ORF tlr2360 encoding a hypothetical TPR protein from Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 and a hypothetical ORF from Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS 101 (ZP 00072573) showed the highest alignment scores of 138 and 137, respectively. In Arabidopsis thaliana, PratA shares the highest similarity (alignment score of 92) with an O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) At3g04240. However, the homologous region is restricted to the N-terminal TPR domain of the enzyme and not to its C-terminal transferase domain (36Hartweck L.M. Scott C.L. Olszewski N.E. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1279-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus indicating that PratA is not an OGT. The absence of an obvious PratA homologue in higher plants might reflect the difference in the molecular details of the processing reaction between these organisms: In Synechocystis 6803, the removal of the C-terminal extension of 16 amino acids has been shown to be a sequential two-step proteolytic process with a transient accumulation of a processing intermediate (37Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 9 amino acids comprising the C-terminal extension of pD1 from higher plants is excised by a single proteolytic step. However, because the TPR motif is highly degenerate (4Blatch G.L. Lassle M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), further reliable conclusions concerning PratA homologues in other organisms can only be drawn from functional analysis. The two-hybrid data strongly suggest that PratA directly interacts with the C terminus of pD1, most likely through its TPR domain. Repeated attempts to detect this complex formation in vitro by applying Far Western or pulldown experiments with recombinant PratA and pD1 proteins were not conclusive. Most probably this reflects the short-lived character of the PratA-pD1 interaction, a feature that one would expect when the rapid C-terminal processing of pD1 in the wild-type is taken into account. However, even a transient interaction indicates that the periplasm-located PratA (31Fulda S. Huang F. Nilsson F. Hagemann M. Norling B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5900-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) directly contacts pD1, implying that PratA must be present in close spatial vicinity to pD1 within the cell. Interestingly, it has been recently hypothesized that the initial steps of photosystem biogenesis take place at the plasma membrane of Synechocystis 6803 (14Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the finding that, by immunological means, the D1 protease CtpA has been detected exclusively in the plasma membrane and not in the thylakoids (14Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These data would favor a scenario in which newly synthesized pD1 is inserted into the plasma membrane where it assembles into precomplexes. The C terminus of pD1 would be oriented to the periplasm and processed by CtpA with the assistance of the periplasmic PratA. The preformed PSII complexes would then migrate to the thylakoids by lateral membrane fusion or membrane vesicle transport (32Westphal S. Heins L. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4243-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this model, a still unresolved matter concerns the maturation of D1 protein that is inserted into pre-existing PSII complexes during the PSII repair cycle. Analogous to the situation in chloroplasts from eukaryotes, one would expect that this process takes place at the cyanobacterial thylakoid membrane and not the plasma membrane. Hence, a D1 maturation pathway at the thylakoids might exist that operates independently from the periplasmic PratA factor. The existence of an additional, spatially separated D1 processing machinery might explain why the inactivation of PratA still allows residual photosynthetic activity and, thus, D1 maturation. Of course, the proposed model requires further confirmation. Nevertheless, we succeeded in providing the first genetic evidence that a periplasmic factor is involved in PSII biogenesis. Furthermore, our data identify the TPR protein, PratA, that is involved in the C-terminal processing of the D1 reaction center protein of PSII. Future work will be focused on the elucidation of the precise working mode of PratA and, concurrently, on the spatial organization of thylakoid membrane biogenesis. We thank R. Houmany and U.

https://openalex.org/W1988141692,"Sphingolipids are essential membrane components of eukaryotic cells. Their synthesis is initiated with the condensation of l-serine with palmitoyl-CoA, producing 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS), followed by a reduction to dihydrosphingosine by KDS reductase.

Moreover, the topology studies provide insight into the spatial organization of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Sphingolipids are essential lipid components of the eukaryotic membrane. Recent studies have demonstrated that sphingolipids, together with cholesterol, form lipid microdomains or rafts that play important roles in membrane traffic and cell signaling (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Moreover, some sphingolipid metabolites such as ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate function as bioactive lipid molecules that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell migration (2Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids consist of a hydrophobic ceramide backbone and a hydrophilic polar head group. Mammalian sphingolipids include sphingomyelin, with phosphocholine as its head group, and hundreds of glycosphingolipids with carbohydrate head groups. Biosynthesis of these sphingolipids begins with the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and l-serine by serine palmitoyltransferase, producing 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS) 1The abbreviations used are: KDS, 3-ketodihydrosphingosine; DHS, dihydrosphingosine; PHS, phytosphingosine; FVT, follicular lymphoma variant translocation; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HEK, human embryonic kidney; mFVT-1, mouse FVT-1; hFVT-1, human FVT-1; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TLC, thin layer chromatography; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25843-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 4Sims K.J. Spassieva S.D. Voit E.O. Obeid L.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This biosynthetic pathway is well conserved, even in lower eukaryotes like the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with the exception of the final step (4Sims K.J. Spassieva S.D. Voit E.O. Obeid L.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the yeast, dihydroceramide desaturase does not exist; hence sphingosine-type ceramide is not produced. Instead, dihydroceramide or phytoceramide serves as the hydrophobic backbone of the sphingolipids, with phytosphingosine (PHS) being generated by hydroxylation at the C-4 position of DHS by C-4 hydroxylase (6Haak D.

Most of the enzymes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis have been identified in recent years, and the contribution of yeast genetic approaches in these studies has been quite significant. LCB1 and LCB2 were identified as genes required for the serine palmitoyltransferase activity in yeast (8Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J.

Subsequent studies demonstrated that Lcb1p and Lcb2p are subunits of serine palmitoyltransferase (11Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similarly, Lag1p and Lac1p share homology and have overlapping functions in dihydroceramide/phytoceramide synthesis in yeast (15Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C.

Their homologs, UOG1, TRH1, and TRH4, recently were demonstrated to be involved in dihydroceramide/ceramide synthesis in mammals (17Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C.

Interestingly, Sur2p, a C-4 hydroxylase found in yeast, shares the same desaturase/hydroxylase superfamily as DES1, which is a mammalian dihydroceramide desaturase (6Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T.

The yeast gene TSC10 was identified in a screening for temperature-sensitive suppressors of the Ca2+-sensitive Δcsg2 mutant (5Beeler T. Bacikova D. Gable K. Hopkins L. Johnson C. Slife H. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30688-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This mutant exhibits a defect in the synthesis of mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide, one of three myo-inositol-containing sphingolipids in yeast (21Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The temperature-sensitive tsc10 mutants accumulated KDS and lacked KDS reductase activity (5Beeler T. Bacikova D. Gable K. Hopkins L. Johnson C. Slife H. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30688-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Moreover, purified recombinant Tsc10p catalyzed the conversion of KDS to DHS in an NADPH-dependent manner, indicating that Tsc10p is a KDS reductase (5Beeler T. Bacikova D. Gable K. Hopkins L. Johnson C. Slife H. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30688-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although Tsc10p was identified in 1998 (5Beeler T. Bacikova D. Gable K. Hopkins L. Johnson C. Slife H. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30688-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), experimental evidence identifying its mammalian homolog has remained lacking thus far. In the present study, we demonstrate that the KDS reductase in mammals is encoded by the follicular lymphoma variant translocation-1 (FVT-1) gene, a gene identified previously in follicular lymphoma as being juxtaposed to an immunoglobulin Jκ segment by chromosome translocation (22Rimokh R. Gadoux M. Bertheas M.F. Berger F. Garoscio M. Deleage G. Germain D. Magaud J.P. Blood. 1993; 81: 136-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the identity of this mammalian gene and its product in hand, we are now at last able to establish the characteristics for this mammalian KDS reductase and examine its role in sphingolipid synthesis. Northern blotting demonstrated that FVT-1 is expressed throughout the body in all tissues examined, although its expression varied among tissues, suggesting that FVT-1 is a ubiquitous KDS reductase. Although FVT-1 had been predicted to be a secreted protein (22Rimokh R. Gadoux M. Bertheas M.F. Berger F. Garoscio M. Deleage G. Germain D. Magaud J.P. Blood. 1993; 81: 136-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our immunofluorescence microscopic analysis showed that FVT-1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, we also reveal that the domain encompassing its active site is exposed to the cytosol, indicating that sphingolipid synthesis proceeds on the cytosolic leaflet of the ER membrane, at least up to the production of DHS. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium D6429 or D6046, respectively (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK293T cells were grown on collagen-coated dishes. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus™ Reagent (Invitrogen). Construction of Δtsc10 Yeast Strains—The TSC10 gene was amplified by PCR using yeast genomic DNA and primers TSC10-F (5′-ACTAGTACTGGCAGCAGCTGCAGAC-3′) and TSC10-R (5′-CCTGCGTTCCCTGAGCACGGTCCTG-3′) and then cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) to generate pAK568. The Δtsc10::LEU2 construct was generated by replacement of the 0.7-kb BclI-EcoRV region in the TSC10 gene with the LEU2 marker and was used to transform the S. cerevisiae diploid cells KA31 (MATa/α ura3/ura3 leu2/leu2 his3/his3 trp1/trp1) (23Irie K. Takase M. Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Araki H. Matsumoto K. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3076-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic complete (SC; 0.67% yeast nitrogen base and 2% glucose) plates lacking leucine. One of the clones obtained, designated KHY623, exhibited a TSC10+/Δtsc10::LEU2 genotype. The KHY623 cells were sporulated, and the resulting tetrads were dissected onto YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) plates containing 5 μm PHS and 0.0015% Nonidet P-40 as a dispersant. The haploid spores were then allowed to form colonies at 30 °C. One of the clones, KHY625 (MATa ura3 Δtsc10::LEU2 his3 trp1), was used for further studies. Plasmids—The pAK80 plasmid is a yeast cloning vector for TDH3 promoter-dependent expression (24Kihara A. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30048-30054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The pAK157 plasmid, a derivative of pAK80, was constructed to produce an N-terminally FLAG-tagged fusion protein. For construction of the pAK287 plasmid (FLAG-TSC10), the TSC10 gene was amplified using yeast genomic DNA and primers 5′-GGATCCATGAAGTTTACGTTAGAAGACC-3′ and 5′-TGAGAGTGGATGTGCTCTCAGTTGG-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy to generate pAK270. The pAK287 plasmid was produced by cloning the 1.0-kb BamHI-NotI fragment of pAK270 into the BamHI-NotI site of pAK157. The mouse FVT-1 (mFVT-1) cDNA was amplified by PCR using total cDNA prepared from the mouse teratocarcinoma cell line F9 and primers mFVT1-F1 (5′-TCGGCAGAGATGTTGCTGTTGGCCG-3′) and mFVT1-R1 (5′-GGGGCAAGGTTTAGGCAGTTTTGTC-3′). The amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy to create pAK565. The obtained nucleotide sequence has been deposited with GenBank™ with accession number AY634684. For expression in yeast, pAK572 was constructed by cloning the 1.1-kb NotI-NotI fragment of pAK565 into the NotI site of pAK80. The human FVT-1 (hFVT-1) cDNA was amplified from a cDNA mixture, prepared from adult male human liver (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using primers hFVT1-F1 (5′-GGAGCGATGCTGCTGCTGGCTGCCGCC-3′) and hFVT1-R1 (5′-AAGAAGATTAGGCAGTTTTGTCTGC-3′). The amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy to generate pAK588. To express the hFVT-1 gene in yeast, the 1.1-kb NotI-NotI fragment of pAK588 was cloned into pAK80 to produce pAK574. The pAK600 (FLAG-hFVT-1) and pAK602 (FLAG-ΔN-hFVT-1) plasmids were constructed as follows. First, full-length hFVT-1 and N-terminally truncated hFVT-1 (ΔN-hFVT-1) cDNAs were amplified from the pAK588 using a common primer (5′-TTTCTAGAAGATTAGGCAGTTTTGTCTGC-3′) and respective primers (for pAK600, 5′-GGATCCATGCTGCTGCTGGCTGCCGCC-3′, and for pAK602, 5′-GGATCCAAGCCCCTCGCCCTGCCCG-3′). These were cloned into pGEM-T Easy to generate pAK591 and pAK592 plasmids, respectively. The pAK600 and pAK602 plasmids were then constructed by cloning the BamHI-XbaI fragment of pAK591 or pAK592 into the BamHI-XbaI site of pAK157. The pCE-puro hFVT-1 plasmid, designed to express hFVT-1 in mammalian cells, was constructed by cloning the hFVT-1 cDNA from pAK588 into the pCE-puro plasmid (25Kihara A. Ikeda M. Kariya Y. Lee E.Y. Lee Y.M. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14578-14585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Finally, the pAK603 plasmid (MBP-ΔN-hFVT-1) was constructed by cloning the 0.9-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment of pAK592 into the BamHI-XbaI site of pMAL-c2E (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA), an Escherichia coli expression vector constructed to produce a fusion protein with an N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) domain. Preparation of Soluble and Membrane Fractions—HEK293T cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Diagnostics), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)), and sonicated. After centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was used as a total fraction. For preparing soluble and membrane fractions, the total fraction was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Purification of MBP-ΔN-hFVT-1 Protein—The E. coli cells Rosetta (Novagen (EMD Biosciences, Inc.), La Jolla, CA) bearing the pAK603 plasmid were grown at 37 °C in LB (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl (pH 7.2)) medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol to early log phase. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mm) was added to the culture to induce expression of MBP-ΔN-hFVT-1. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, cells were chilled on ice and collected by centrifugation. Cells were suspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1mm PMSF) and incubated on ice for 30 min with 1/10 volume of 1 mg/ml lysozyme, suspended in 0.1 m EDTA (pH 8.0). Cells were lysed by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the membrane fraction (pellet) was suspended in buffer B. After incubation with Triton X-100 (final concentration, 1%) at 4 °C for 30 min, solubilized proteins were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto an amylose resin (New England Biolabs, Inc.), washed with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100), and eluted with buffer C containing 10 mm maltose. In Vitro KDS Reductase Assay—The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm PMSF, 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 μm NADPH, 50 μm KDS, and purified MBP-ΔN-hFVT-1 protein. When total membrane fractions were used instead of the purified protein, 1 mm NADPH and 100 μm KDS were included. All reactions were performed by incubating the samples at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding 1 m NH4OH, and the oxidation of NADPH was monitored by measuring the decreased absorbance at 340 nm. Alternatively, for lipid extractions the reactions were terminated by 3.75 volumes of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), followed by 1.25 volumes of chloroform and 1.25 volumes of 1% KCl. Phases were separated by centrifugation, and the organic phase was recovered, dried, and suspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The lipids were resolved by TLC on Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC plates (Merck) with chloroform, methanol, 2 n NH4OH (40:10:1, v/v). KDS and DHS were visualized by spraying the plates with 0.3% ninhydrin in 1-butanol/acetic acid (100:3, v/v) and heating at 180 °C for 1 min. KDS and DHS were purchased from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA) and Sigma, respectively. Northern Blotting—Poly(A)+ RNA blots containing 1 μg of RNA from human tissues (Clontech, BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) and total RNA blots containing 20 μg of RNA from mouse tissues (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) were used. The hFVT-1 fragments were amplified using the pAK567 plasmid and primers hFVT1-F1 and hFVT1-R1, whereas the mFVT-1 fragments were amplified using pAK565 and primers mFVT1-F1 and mFVT1-R1. These fragments were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming using the random primer DNA labeling kit, version 2 (TAKARA Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), to generate their probes. Hybridization was carried out in ExpressHyb buffer (Clontech, BD Biosciences) for 2 h at 68 °C. Immunoblotting and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Rabbit polyclonal anti-hFVT-1 antiserum was raised against the middle region of the hFVT-1 protein (amino acid residues 26–292) following expression of the MBP-fused protein. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (25Kihara A. Ikeda M. Kariya Y. Lee E.Y. Lee Y.M. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14578-14585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Anti-hFVT-1 antiserum (1:1000 dilution), anti-calnexin (H-10) antibody (0.2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (1:7500 dilution) were used. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis was done as described previously (26Ogawa C. Kihara A. Gokoh M. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1268-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Anti-hFVT-1 antiserum (1:100 dilution), anti-KDEL antibody (1 μg/ml; Stressgen Biotechnologies, Inc., San Diego, CA), Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (5 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (5 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc.) were used. Proteinase K Digestion Assay—HEK293T cells transfected with pCE-puro hFVT-1 were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, suspended in buffer D (20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm PMSF), and lysed using an electric Potter homogenizer for 10 strokes. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in buffer D (without the protease inhibitor mixture or PMSF) and treated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100. After termination of the digestion with 1 mm PMSF, total proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 20 min. Protein precipitates were washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and with acetone and then suspended in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue) containing 1 mm PMSF, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting. Identification of FVT-1—To identify a mammalian KDS reductase, the GenBank™ data base was searched using the BLAST program for sequences similar to yeast Tsc10p. Although no apparent homologs could be found, various members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, to which Tsc10p belongs, exhibited moderate sequence similarities (∼20% identity). These included FVT-1, 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3, some short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 10 isoforms, 17-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, and sepiapterin reductase. Of these, we chose human FVT-1 (23.5% identity and 40.7% similarity with Tsc10p) as a candidate for being a mammalian KDS reductase because its amino acid length (332 amino acids) is similar to that of Tsc10p (320 amino acids) and because its function was unknown. Additionally, we found a putative mouse homolog of hFVT-1. The mFVT-1 sequence indicated 92.8% identity and 97.3% similarity to hFVT-1 and 20.8% identity and 39.5% similarity to Tsc10p (Fig. 1). Both FVT-1 proteins contain a 25-amino acid extension at the N terminus, which is absent in Tsc10p. This N-terminal stretch is considerably hydrophobic and is predicted to function as a transmembrane segment (Fig. 1). In addition, two putative transmembrane segments are present in hFVT-1 and mFVT-1 at their C termini (Fig. 1). The large hydrophilic domain located between the putative first and second transmembrane segments of FVT-1 contains a region (corresponding to amino acid residues 35–269 of hFVT-1) that exhibits similarity to SDR family members. In the SDR family only a single Tyr residue is strictly conserved, and site-directed mutagenesis and x-ray crystallography have demonstrated that this Tyr residue is crucial to enzyme activity (27Ghosh D. Weeks C.M. Grochulski P. Duax W.L. Erman M. Rimsay R.L. Orr J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10064-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Ensor C.M. Tai H.H. Biochem.

Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Atrian S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A Lys residue four positions downstream is also conserved in most SDR members (32Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), so a catalytic mechanism based on the Tyr-X-X-X-Lys motif has been proposed (33McKinley-McKee J.S. Winberg J.O. Pettersson G. Biochem. Int. 1991; 25: 879-885PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Tyr-186 and Lys-190 in hFVT-1 correspond to this motif. The same motif is found in mFVT-1 and Tsc10p (Fig. 1, dotted residues). SDR members require NAD(H) or NADP(H) as a coenzyme for their enzyme activity. A Gly-X-X-X-Gly-X-Gly segment, generally characteristic of the coenzyme-binding fold in dehydrogenases (32Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D.

Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar), is also present in FVT-1 and Tsc10p proteins (Fig. 1, dashed line). A single Lys residue is observed at the -3 position in the C termini of both hFVT-1 and mFVT-1. Lys is known to be important for ER membrane proteins to be retained at the ER, although typically ER retention signals are KKXX and KXKXX sequences (34Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Tsc10p contains a KKXX type sequence at its C terminus (Fig. 1). FVT-1 Is a KDS Reductase—First we examined whether ectopic expression of hFVT-1 or mFVT-1 in the TSC10-null yeast cells complemented the growth phenotype. Because sphingolipids are essential for cell viability, Δtsc10 cells cannot grow normally, unless the addition of DHS or PHS to the medium bypasses the requirement of de novo sphingolipid synthesis (5Beeler T. Bacikova D. Gable K. Hopkins L. Johnson C. Slife H. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30688-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). KHY625 (Δtsc10) cells bearing a vector plasmid could not grow on SC plates lacking uracil (SC - URA plates) in the absence of PHS but grew once it was added to the medium (Fig. 2A). The introduction of pAK287, encoding N-terminally FLAG-tagged TSC10, allowed KHY625 cells to grow in the absence of PHS (Fig. 2A). Moreover, both pAK572 and pAK574 plasmids, encoding the mFVT-1 and hFVT-1 genes, respectively, enabled the growth of KHY625 cells (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that hFVT-1 and mFVT-1 are functional homologs of Tsc10p. We next investigated the KDS reductase activity of hFVT-1 in vitro. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with a pCE-puro hFVT-1 plasmid or a control vector plasmid. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-hFVT-1 antibody. The hFVT-1 protein was detected in the lysates from pCE-puro hFVT-1 plasmid-transfected cells as a 36-kDa band, consistent with its predicted molecular mass of 36.2 kDa, whereas it was absent in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3A).

https://openalex.org/W2116654405,"ped/pea-15 is a ubiquitously expressed 15-kDa protein featuring a broad anti-apoptotic function. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, the pro-apoptotic Omi/HtrA2 mitochondrial serine protease was identified as a specific interactor of the ped/pea-15 death effector domain. Omi/HtrA2 also bound recombinant ped/pea-15 in vitro and co-precipitated with ped/pea-15 in 293 and HeLa cell extracts. In these cells, the binding of Omi/HtrA2 to ped/pea-15 was induced by UVC exposure and followed the mitochondrial release of Omi/HtrA2 into the cytoplasm. Upon UVC exposure, cellular ped/pea-15 protein expression levels decreased. This effect was prevented by the ucf-101 specific inhibitor of the Omi/HtrA2 proteolytic activity, in a dose-dependent fashion. In vitro incubation of ped/pea-15 with Omi/HtrA2 resulted in ped/pea-15 degradation. In intact cells, the inhibitory action of ped/pea-15 on UVC-induced apoptosis progressively declined at increasing Omi/HtrA2 expression. This further effect of Omi/HtrA2 was also inhibited by ucf-101. In addition, ped/pea-15 expression blocked Omi/HtrA2 co-precipitation with the caspase inhibitor protein XIAP and caspase 3 activation. Thus, in part, apoptosis following Omi/HtrA2 mitochondrial release is mediated by reduction in ped/pea-15 cellular levels. The ability of Omi/HtrA2 to relieve XIAP inhibition on caspases is modulated by the relative levels of Omi/HtrA2 and ped/pea-15. ped/pea-15 is a ubiquitously expressed 15-kDa protein featuring a broad anti-apoptotic function.

The ability of Omi/HtrA2 to relieve XIAP inhibition on caspases is modulated by the relative levels of Omi/HtrA2 and ped/pea-15. Apoptosis is mediated by proteolytic activation of caspases. Activated caspases catalytically degrade important intracellular substrates and induce cell death (1Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6181) Google Scholar). The initial proteolytic cleavage of caspases may be induced by the extrinsic cell-surface pathway through the activation of the tumor necrosis family of receptors, and/or by the intrinsic route through the release of different apoptotic proteins from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm (3Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar, 4Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because of its destructive nature, caspase activity must be tightly regulated inside the cells. However, the identity of the molecules involved in restraining apoptosis and their mechanism of action have been only partially elucidated. ped/pea-15 is a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic protein exerting a broad anti-apoptotic action (5Danziger N.

First, by virtue of its death effector domain (DED), 1The abbreviations used are: DED, death effector domain; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins; GST, glutathione S-transferase. ped/pea-15 binds other DED-containing proteins, preventing formation of the death-inducing signaling complex and inhibiting activation of the caspase cascade (8Condorelli G.

Second, ped/pea-15 inhibits p38 and JNK activation by stress-inducing agents at a very upstream step in the stress-activated protein kinase activation cascade (9Condorelli G. Trencia A. Vigliotta G. Perfetti A. Goglia U. Cassese A. Musti A.M. Miele C. Santopietro S. Formisano P. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11013-11018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus ped/pea-15 exerts its anti-apoptotic function by acting at multiple steps in the processes leading to caspase activation. Whether ped/pea-15 also affects apoptotic mechanisms triggered upon release of mitochondrial proteins is unknown at the present. The Omi/HtrA2 serine protease is an antagonist of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) identified in mammals (11Gray C.W. Ward R.V. Karran E. Turconi S. Rowles A. Viglienghi D. Southan C. Barton A. Fantom K.G. West A. Savopoulos J. Hassan N.J. Clinkenbeard H. Hanning C. Amegadzie B. Davis J.B. Dingwall C. Livi G.P. Creasy C.L. Eur. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2581-2588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Omi/HtrA2 is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein. Cellular stresses, such as UV exposure, induces cleavage of the Omi/HtrA2 mitochondrial localization sequence thereby generating a mature active molecule featuring a new apoptogenic NH2 terminus, termed the IAP-binding motif (13Yang Q.H. Church-Hajduk R. Ren J. Newton M.L. Du C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 487-496Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This motif consists of a short stretch of hydrophobic amino acids. Hence, Omi/HtrA2 is released into the cytosol and competitively binds to the BIR domain of IAPs through the IAP-binding motif (14Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 15Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.W. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y.

Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). This event leads to the release and reactivation of the BIR-bound caspases. Thus, Omi/HtrA2 binding displaces IAPs from caspases releasing the suppressive effect on caspase activity. Furthermore, Omi/HtrA2 can also trigger apoptosis in a caspase-independent pathway, which entirely depends on its serine protease function (17Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.W. Zhang Z.

However, neither the mechanism nor the significance of this function is clearly understood. In this article, we show that, upon release into the cytoplasm of 293 cells, Omi/HtrA2 binds to and degrades ped/pea-15, thereby removing its anti-apoptotic action and triggering apoptosis. Thus, in addition to controlling the extrinsic pathway, ped/pea-15 is also embedded into the intrinsic pathway inducing caspase activation. We show that the relative levels of ped/pea-15 and Omi/HtrA2 play an important role in committing the cells to undergo apoptosis or survival. Materials—Media, sera, and antibiotics for cell culture and the LipofectAMINE reagent were from Invitrogen. PED polyclonal antibodies have been previously described (6Condorelli G. Vigliotta G.

The yeast strain AH109, the human HeLa cDNA library in the pGADT7 vector, and the Matchmaker Gal4 two-hybrid system 3 were from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Generation of pGBKT7 yeast expression plasmids encoding the ped/pea-15 FL or DED cDNAs or the ped/pea-15-(80–130) COOH terminus cDNA were obtained by amplifying ped/pea-15, respectively, with the following sets of primers. ped/pea-15 5′ NdeI (5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGTTGAGTACGGG-3′) and 3′ped/pea-15 BamHI (5′CGCGGATCCTCAGGCCTTCTTCGCTGG GGGACC-3′); ped/pea-15 5′ NdeI (5′GGGAATTCCATATGGTTGAGTAC GGG-3′) and ped/pea-15 3′ EcoRI (5′CCGGAATTCTCAAACCACCATAGTGAGTAGGTC-3′); ped/pea-15 5′ EcoRI (5′CCGGAATTCGACTACAGAA CCCGTGTGCTG-3′) and ped/pea-15 3′ BamHI (5′CGCGGATCCTCAGGCCTTCTTCGCTGGGGGACC-3′).

The 293 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin, and 2% l-glutamine in a humidified CO2 incubator. Transient transfection experiments with Omi/HtrA2 and ped/pea-15 cDNAs were performed using the LipofectAMINE method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, the cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes up to 80% confluence and incubated for 24 h with the indicated amounts of cDNA and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. An equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum was added for 5 h. The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum and the cells were further incubated for 24 h before the assay. For detecting apoptosis, the cells were exposed to UVC (100 J/m2), as indicated in the description of the individual experiments. Apoptosis was then estimated using the Apoptosis ELISA Plus kit (Roche Diagnostics), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For caspase 3 cleavage, subconfluent cells were exposed to UVC as above. The cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants were subjected to Western blotting with caspase 3 antibodies. Transformation of Yeast Strains and β-Galactosidase Assay—Plasmid DNA transformations were performed using an high efficiency lithium acetate procedure (22Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Cotransformants were propagated on Trp–, Leu– plates, and potential interacting clones selected in Trp–, Leu–, His–, Ade– media. After 4 days of incubation at 30 °C, positive clones were further tested for β-galactosidase activity by liquid culture assays using the substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as described by Miller et al. (23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Clones of interest were analyzed by DNA sequencing and BLAST analysis. Cell Subfractionation and Western Blot Analysis—Subcellular fractions were obtained as described in Refs. 24Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol.

Lysed cells were centrifuged at 200 × g to pellet nuclei. Supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet the heavy membrane fraction containing mitochondria, and the resulting liquid phase was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g to pellet plasma membranes. The last supernatant represented the cytosolic fraction (24Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol.

Mitochondria were further purified by resuspending heavy membrane pellets in 250 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and layering on 30% Percoll, 225 mm mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation at 95,000 × g, mitochondria were recovered from the lower phase (26Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were then centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and used in the experiments described below. Purity of the mitochondrial fraction was assessed by assaying succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase activities (27Gateau O. Morelis R. Louisot P. Eur. J.

Results showed that >99% activity of these enzymes associated with the mitochondrial fractions and <1% of the total activities with the other fractions. For Western blot assays, the cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4PO7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min and solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred on 0.45-μm Immobilion-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Upon incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Interaction of Omi/HtrA2 and ped/pea-15 and Protease Assay—To analyze ped/pea-15 interaction with Omi/HtrA2, a ped/pea-15-glutatione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was generated as described in Ref. 29Trencia A. Perfetti A. Cassese A. Vigliotta G. Miele C. Oriente F. Santopietro S. Giacco F. Condorelli G. Formisano P. Beguinot F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar. Cell lysates (500 μg of protein) were incubated in the presence of Sepharose-bound GST-ped/pea-15 (2 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with TnT buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then resuspended in Laemmli buffer followed by boiling for 4 min and centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 3 min. Supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting with Omi/HtrA2 antibodies. Omi/HtrA2 protease activity was assayed by incubating 2 μg of recombinant his-Omi/HtrA2-(134–458) protein with 10 μg of recombinant ped/pea-15 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped with SDS-sample buffer and samples were boiled for 5 min. The reaction products were analyzed be SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using ped/pea-15 antibodies. Alternatively, the reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Isolation and Identification of Omi/HtrA2 as a Novel ped/pea-15 Interacting Protein—To search for proteins that specifically interact with ped/pea-15, a yeast two-hybrid system was established using the full-length (FL) ped/pea-15 gene (pG-BKT7-ped/pea-15) as bait to screen a human HeLa library (Clontech). Upon HIS3 selection, 45 β-galactosidase positive cDNA clones were detected. Based upon sequence analysis and BLAST searching, 6 of these clones were shown to match the Omi/HtrA2 serine protease (11Gray C.W. Ward R.V. Karran E. Turconi S. Rowles A. Viglienghi D. Southan C.

We also sought to define the region responsible for the interaction of Omi/HtrA2 with ped/pea-15. We generated two further pGBKT7 plasmids encoding either the DED (amino acids 1–80), or the COOH terminus region of ped/pea-15 (amino acids 80–130). We then compared the ability of the pGADT7-Omi/HtrA2 to interact with the full-length, DED, and the COOH terminus regions of ped/pea-15 in the yeast system. Measurement of β-galactosidase activity revealed that Omi/HtrA2 interacted with both the FL and ped/pea-15 DED fusion proteins (Fig. 1). However, no Omi/HtrA2 interaction was detected when the ped/pea-15 COOH terminus was used as bait. No interaction was also detected when the DEDs of the FADD or FLICE proteins were used, suggesting that Omi/HtrA2 specifically interacts with the ped/pea-15 death effector domain. Omi/HtrA2 Interacts with ped/pea-15 in Vitro as Well as in Mammalian Cells—Upon cell exposure to UV and other stressinducing agents, Omi/HtrA2 is released from mitochondria (18Suzuki Y. Imai Y.

To verify the interaction of Omi/HtrA2 with ped/pea-15 in mammalian cells, we used HeLa cells expressing endogenous ped/pea-15 and 293 cells stably transfected with ped/pea-15 cDNA (293PED). As shown in Fig. 2A, precipitation of lysates from the two cell types with ped/pea-15 antibodies followed by blotting with Omi/HtrA2 antibodies revealed little ped/pea-15 co-precipitation with Omi/HtrA2. UV exposure of the cells, however, induced a >20-fold increase in the co-precipitation, suggesting that UV-induced cleavage of Omi/HtrA2 is necessary to enable interaction with ped/pea-15 as well as with IAPs. Indeed, in control experiments, UV treatment caused the appearance of the 37,000 mature Omi/HtrA2 in the total cell lysates and simultaneous disappearance of the 49,000 precursor (data not shown). Whether in the absence or presence of UV irradiation no co-precipitation occurred in untransfected 293 cells, as these cells do not express detectable levels of endogenous ped/pea-15 (Fig. 2A). Based on pull-down assays, GST-fused recombinant ped/pea-15 bound to the endogenous Omi/HtrA2 in 293 cell extracts (Fig. 2B). Omi/HtrA2 interaction with ped/pea-15 was >2-fold more evident in lysates from 293 cells that have been transiently transfected with the Omi/HtrA2 cDNA and overexpress Omi/HtrA2 by 2.5-fold. No pull-down was detectable using GST alone. No pull-down was detectable blotting with JNK rather than with Omi/HtrA2 antibodies either, indicating that Omi/HtrA2 specifically binds ped/pea-15 in vitro as well as in intact mammalian cells. Omi/HtrA2 Mitochondrial Release Is Accompanied by Reduced ped/pea-15 Cellular Levels—To further investigate the biological significance of Omi/HtrA2 interaction with ped/pea-15, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments in UV-exposed and unexposed cells. In the absence of UV treatment, Omi/HtrA2 was mainly mitochondrial both in the 293PED and the ped/pea-15 untransfected cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In both cell types, UV exposure led to an almost complete disappearance of mitochondrial Omi/HtrA2 and a parallel appearance of Omi/HtrA2 in the cytoplasmic fraction. At variance, ped/pea-15 was only detected in the cytoplasm of the 293PED cells, whether UV-treated or not. Indeed, co-precipitation of Omi/HtrA2 with ped/pea-15 only occurred in the cytoplasmic fraction of the 293PED cells and only upon UV-induced mitochondrial release (Fig. 3C). Importantly, upon UV exposure, ped/pea-15 cellular levels declined in parallel with the release of Omi/HtrA2 into the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B), raising the possibility that Omi/HtrA2 may reduce stability of ped/pea-15. To test this hypothesis, we transiently overexpressed Omi/HtrA2 in 293PED as well as in HeLa cells (expressing only endogenous ped/pea-15). Then, upon UV light exposure, we compared ped/pea-15 levels in the transfected versus the untransfected cells. In both the 293PED and HeLa cells, overexpression of Omi/HtrA2 (20-fold above the endogenous levels) caused only a slight 10% reduction in ped/pea-15 levels (Fig. 4A; p < 0.01). However, upon UV irradiation and Omi/HtrA2 release into the cytoplasm, the cells overexpressing Omi/HtrA2 exhibited a 2-fold larger reduction in ped/pea-15 levels compared with those expressing only the endogenous Omi/HtrA2. Importantly, this decrease in ped/pea-15 levels was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by the specific Omi/HtrA2 protease inhibitor ucf-101 (Fig. 4B) (32Cilenti L. Lee Y. Hess S. Srinivasula S. Park K.M. Junqueira D. Davis H. Bonventre J.V. Alnemri E.S. Zervos A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1489-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (109) Google Scholar), indicating that the UV effect is largely dependent on Omi/HtrA2 protease activity. We have therefore tested the hypothesis that ped/pea-15 may serve as a direct Omi/HtrA2 substrate. We incubated recombinant ped/pea-15 (rped/pea-15) with active recombinant Omi/HtrA2-(134–458). After a 2-h incubation, we compared the amount of intact ped/pea-15 remaining in the absence or presence of Omi/HtrA2. Based on Western blot analysis and Coomassie Blue staining (A), ped/pea-15 protein level was decreased by 60% in the presence of Omi/HtrA2 (Fig. 5). GST was not affected by Omi/HtrA2, however (B). As shown in panel A, Omi/HtrA2-induced disappearance of ped/pea-15 was prevented by ucf-101, indicating specific cleavage of ped/pea-15 by the Omi/HtrA2 protease in vitro. Omi/HtrA2 Reduces ped/pea-15 Anti-apoptotic Function— We also sought to examine the functional consequences of Omi/HtrA2 mitochondrial release on ped/pea-15 function. To this end, we analyzed UV-induced apoptosis in 293PED cells upon transient transfection of increasing amounts of Omi/HtrA2 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 6, the expression of ped/pea-15 in 293 cells was accompanied by a 90% reduction in UV apoptosis. However, the anti-apoptotic function of ped/pea-15 was reduced by Omi/HtrA2 transfection. This reduction paralleled the increase in the Omi/HtrA2 expression level in the cells and was prevented by ucf-101 treatment, suggesting that, in part, apoptosis following Omi/HtrA2 mitochondrial release is mediated by reduction in ped/pea-15 cellular levels. Indeed, in HeLa cells, increased levels of transfected Omi/HtrA2 caused increased degradation of endogenous ped/pea-15, which was inhibited by ucf-101 (Fig. 7A, top). As in the 293PED cells, Omi/HtrA2 transfection in HeLa cells was accompanied by augmented UV-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7A, bottom), as a function of the expression level of Omi/HtrA2 achieved (Fig. 7B).Fig. 7Modulation of the anti-apoptotic function of endogenous ped/pea-15 by Omi/HtrA2 in HeLa cells. A, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the indicated amounts of Omi/HtrA2 cDNA and further incubated with 20 μm ucf-101 for 60 min, as indicated. The cells were then exposed to UVC (100 J/m2) and apoptosis was quantitated by the ELISA Plus detection kit as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of the samples were solubilized, blotted with ped/pea-15 antibodies (top panel) or, for control, with Omi/HtrA2 antibodies (B) and revealed by ECL and autoradiography (top panel).

To test this hypothesis, we focused on UV-triggered apoptosis in 293 cells expressing increasing amounts of ped/pea-15. In these cells, apoptosis progressively declined with increasing ped/pea-15 expression levels (Fig. 8). Simultaneously, in 293PED as well as in HeLa cells, ped/pea-15 overexpression inhibited Omi/HtrA2 co-precipitation with the caspase inhibitor protein XIAP (Fig. 9, A and B). In HeLa cells, the effect of ped/pea-15 was accompanied by an almost complete inhibition of UV-induced activation of caspase 3 (Fig. 9C). Caspase 3 cleavage was well evident in cells expressing only the endogenous ped/pea-15, however. Similar results were obtained in 293 cells (data not shown). Thus, in the cell, the ability of Omi/HtrA2 to release the XIAP brake on caspase activation may be modulated by the relative concentrations of Omi/HtrA2 and ped/pea-15.Fig. 9Effect of ped/pea-15 on Omi/HtrA2 co-precipitation with XIAP and caspase 3 activation. A, 293 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated amounts of ped/pea-15 cDNA and then exposed to UVC (100 J/m2). The cells were solubilized and precipitated with XIAP antibodies, followed by blotting with Omi/HtrA2 antibodies. For control, aliquots of the cell lysates were also blotted with ped/pea-15 or XIAP antibodies, as indicated. B and C, HeLa cells were transfected with ped/pea-15 cDNA or with a control plasmid. Aliquots of the lysates obtained from unexposed or UVC-exposed cells were either precipitated with XIAP antibodies, followed by blotting with Omi/HtrA2 antibodies (B, top panel) or directly blotted with ped/pea-15 (B, middle panel), XIAP (B, bottom panel), and caspase 3 antibodies (C). Blots were revealed by ECL and autoradiography. The autoradiographs shown are representative of three independent experiments.

It has been shown that, once in the cytoplasm, Omi/HtrA2 promotes caspase activation and apoptosis by binding to the BIR3 domain of the mammalian caspase inhibitor XIAP (13Yang Q.H. Church-Hajduk R.

There is also evidence that interaction with IAPs is not the only mechanism involved in Omi/HtrA2-induced cell death, as the serine protease activity of Omi/HtrA2, when localized in the cytosol, is sufficient to cause caspase-independent cell death (17Li W.

This evidence led to the concept that protease activity plays an important role in regulation of apoptosis by Omi/HtrA2 (32Cilenti L. Lee Y. Hess S. Srinivasula S. Park K.M. Junqueira D. Davis H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 31469-31472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) have shown that IAPs are substrates for Omi/HtrA2 and their degradation may contribute to caspase activation by Omi/HtrA2. However, whether other substrates also play a role in Omi/HtrA2-induced cell death is unknown. In the present work, we have identified the serine protease Omi/HtrA2 as a novel ped/pea-15 interactor, by yeast two-hybrid screening. Furthermore, we show that the anti-apoptotic protein ped/pea-15 co-precipitates with Omi/HtrA2 in mammalian cell extracts and specifically binds Omi/HtrA2 in pull-down assays. Thus, Omi/HtrA2 may also bind ped/pea-15 in mammalian cells. At variance with ERK, another ped/pea-15-binding protein (35Formstecher E. Ramos J.W. Fauquet M. Calderwood D.A. Hsieh J.C. Canton B.

Cell. 2001; 1: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), Omi/HtrA2 interaction requires the DED of ped/pea-15. Indeed, a truncated protein, lacking the entire DED, does not interact with Omi/HtrA2 in yeast. Furthermore, the DED of ped/pea-15 but not that of other DED-containing proteins, is sufficient for the interaction to occur, indicating specificity of Omi/HtrA2 for the DED of ped/pea-15. Interestingly, the mitochondrial release of Omi/HtrA2 in response to UV exposure was accompanied by a significant decrease in cellular ped/pea-15 levels. This effect was amplified upon overexpression of Omi/HtrA2 cDNA and might have been produced either by Omi/HtrA2 decreasing ped/pea-15 synthesis and/or by increasing its degradation. The latter appeared a more likely possibility based upon the information that Omi/HtrA2 features serine-protease activity (11Gray C.W. Ward R.V. Karran E. Turconi S. Rowles A. Viglienghi D.

Consistently, we have shown that, (i) ped/pea-15 is a substrate of Omi/HtrA2 serine protease in vitro; and (ii) the reduction in ped/pea-15 levels accompanying UV-induced release of Omi/HtrA2 from mitochondria is blocked by a specific inhibitor of its serine protease activity. Thus, the evidence indicates that, upon being released into the cytoplasm, Omi/HtrA2 binds to and degrades ped/pea-15. Degradation of ped/pea-15 by Omi/HtrA2 was accompanied by reduction of the ped/pea-15 apoptosis-inhibiting function. Indeed, the protection from UV-induced apoptosis accomplished by ped/pea-15 in both HeLa and 293 cells was progressively abolished by increasing the expression levels of Omi/HtrA2 in the cell, and this effect was blocked by inhibition of the Omi/HtrA2 serine protease. We suggest therefore that, in part, the caspase-independent cell death induced by cytoplasmic release of Omi/HtrA2 is mediated by ped/pea-15 degradation. The relevance of ped/pea-15 to Omi/HtrA2 apoptosis was further underlined by the finding that, in 293 cells, the ability of Omi/HtrA2 to bind XIAP and induce cleavage and activation of caspase 3 progressively declined in close parallel with increasing ped/pea-15 cellular levels and with increasing protection from UV-induced apoptosis. Thus, the relative concentrations of Omi/HtrA2 and ped/pea-15 in the 293 cell cytoplasm play an important role in committing the cells to apoptosis. Compartmentalization appears to be a major mechanism through which control of this balance is accomplished in the 293 cells. Indeed, in the present work, we show that Omi/HtrA2 interaction with ped/pea-15 only occurs in the cytoplasm and upon UV-induced release of Omi/HtrA2 from the mitochondria. Apoptotic signals alter Omi/HtrA2 compartmentalization enabling its protease activity toward different cytoplasmic substrates whose cleavage fosters activation of the apoptotic machinery of the cell.

Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1165-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On release from the GNB, LPS interacts with the host plasma LPS-binding proteins. This interaction stimulates host monocytes and macrophages to secrete a wide array of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (2Yazawa N. Fujimoto M. Sato S. Miyake K. Asano N.

These peptides are believed to induce complete lysis of the microorganism by perturbation or rupture of the membrane, which leads to leakage of bacterial cell components as well as dissipation of the electrical potential of the membrane (7Nizet V.

Such LPS-binding peptides are potentially active against microorganisms, despite being generally nontoxic to mammalian cells. The molecular basis for this selectivity and the underlying mechanism of permeation of GNB membranes remain ill defined but are believed to be related to the less negatively charged mammalian cell membranes (8Gidalevita D.

To date, two hypotheses have been proposed for membrane perturbation, namely the “barrel-stave” and “carpet” mechanisms (10Oren Z. Hong J. Shai Y. J. Biol.

Diverse living organisms harbor arrays of innate immune molecules that contribute to the first line of defense against opportunistic pathogens (11Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6575) Google Scholar). The horseshoe crab is dubbed a “living fossil,” having survived virtually unchanged for ∼400 million years of evolution. This is probably because of its strong innate immune system, which makes the organism highly resilient to threats from invading pathogens. LPS triggers a coagulation cascade in the horseshoe crab, which represents an important innate immune defense mechanism against the invading pathogen. Being the initiator of the coagulation cascade, Factor C functions as a biosensor (12Ding J.L. Navas M.A. II I Ho B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Ding J.L. Navas M.A. II I Ho B. Mol. Mar. Biol.

Thus, it is conceivable that Factor C harbors an LPS binding motif(s) that exhibits exceptionally high affinity for LPS. The LPS binding domains of Factor C have been characterized (13Ding J.L.

Ding J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36363-36372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), there are several repeating units of Sushi domains of ∼60 amino acids each. Sushi 1 and Sushi 3 contain LPS binding motifs. The core LPS binding region of Sushi 3 resides in a 34-mer peptide, henceforth referred to as S3. Like most antimicrobial peptides, the mechanism of action of S3 is thought to be influenced by LPS (16Tan N.S. Ng M.L. Yau Y.H. Chong P.K. Ho B. Ding J.L. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1801-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). S3 has been demonstrated to bind and kill GNB (18Yau Y.H. Ho B. Tan N.S. Ng M.L. Ding J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2820-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because S3 peptide contains a single cysteine, it is conceivable that in solution, S3 exists in two forms, the monomeric peptide without a disulfide bond and the dimeric peptide linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond. It has been reported for some antimicrobial peptides that multimers are more active than their corresponding monomers (19Lai J.R. Huck B.R. Weisblum B. Gellman S.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12835-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Situ H. Wei G. Smith C.J. Mashhoon S. Bobek L.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 175-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wu Z.

Thus, cysteine can affect the LPS binding ability of S3 peptides. To gain a global perspective on the tolerance of cysteine residues in S3 to amino acid substitutions, a mutant peptide named S3-C27S (where cysteine 27 was changed to serine, C27S) has been synthesized (Fig. 1A), and the structure-activity relationship was analyzed. The effects of the S–S bridged S3 and the conformationally altered mutant, S3-C27S, as well as their biological activities were investigated. Materials—Lipid A from Escherichia coli strain F583, LPS from E. coli strain 0111:B4, and fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC)-LPS from E. coli strain 0111:B4 were purchased from Sigma. Tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) and FITC were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). PyroGene, a recombinant Factor C-based endotoxin detection kit, was acquired from Cambrex Inc. (East Rutherford, NJ). Pyrogen-free water for making buffers was from Baxter (Morton Grove, IL). Peptides—Peptides used in this study were synthesized and purified by Genemed Synthesis Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The native S3 peptide, N-HAEHKVKIGVEQKYGQFPQGTEVTYTCSGNYFLM-C, with a molecular weight of 3,892, corresponds to residues 268–301 of the Factor C Sushi 3 domain (GenBank™/EBI accession number S77063). One mutation was made to substitute cysteine 27 for a serine residue, resulting in S3-C27S. S3-TMR is S3 peptide labeled with a fluorescent probe, TMR. All peptides, collectively referred to as Sushi peptides, were purified to >95% purity by high performance liquid chromatography. Unless otherwise stated, the peptide concentration in this assay refers to the monomeric form. Molecular Weight Determination by Tris-Tricine Gel Electrophoresis—Peptides in reducing (with DTT) and non-reducing (without DTT) buffers were electrophoresed in 15% Tris-Tricine gel and detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Detection of Secondary Structure by Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded in phosphate buffer, pH 7. CD experiments were carried out using a Jasco J-810 CD spectropolarimeter. Spectra were recorded in quartz cell cuvettes of 10-mm path length. The parameters used were bandwidth = 2 nm, step resolution = 0.5 nm, response = 1 s, scan speed = 10 nm/min, and scan width = 190–260 nm. The temperature within the sample chamber was maintained at 25 °C with a continuous flow of nitrogen. Calibration was carried out with d-camphor sulfonic acid. ELISA-based LPS Binding Assay—The polysorp 96-well plate (Maxi-Sorp™, Nunc) was first coated with 100 μl/well of 10 μg/ml (∼1 μm) LPS from E. coli 0111:B4 in pyrogen-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The plate was sealed and incubated overnight at room temperature. The wells were aspirated, washed four times with 300 μl of wash solution (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), and blocked with wash solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 3 h. After washing twice, increasing concentrations of peptides were allowed to interact with bound LPS at room temperature for 3 h. Bound peptides were detected by incubation with rabbit anti-S3 antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Roche Applied Science). Each antibody was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. In the final step, 100 μl of peroxide ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate was added. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm with a reference wavelength of 490 nm. The values were correlated to the amount of LPS bound and peptide present. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis of Real Time Interaction between S3 and Lipid A—The real time interaction between different concentrations of peptides and lipid A was performed according to Tan et al. (15Tan N.S. Ho B. Ding J.L. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 859-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using biointeraction analysis (BIAcore 2000, Amersham Biosciences). The SPR was recorded on an HPA chip coated with E. coli F583 lipid A. The parameters used were flow rate of 20 μl/min, injection volume of 50 μl, and dissociation time of 180 s. The HPA chip was regenerated by a pulse of 0.1 n NaOH until the SPR reached the base line. The temperature within the sample chamber was maintained at 25 °C. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)—The FCS instrument is a self-built system that is centered around a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and uses an excitation source and argon-krypton laser (Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA), which has a 488-nm line for fluorescein excitation and a 530-nm line for TMR excitation. The dichroic and emission filters (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) were 570DRLP and 595AF60 for TMR and 505DRLP and 535DF35 for FITC. Further details on the FCS setup and theory are described in Wohland et al. (22Wohland T. Friedrich K. Hovius R. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8671-8681Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and Krichevsky et al. (23Krichevsky O. Bonnet G. Rep. Prog. Phys. 2002; 65: 251-297Crossref Scopus (645) Google Scholar), respectively. FCS provides three different parameters for our investigation. (i) One parameter is the diffusion coefficient of the different fluorescent species in the sample. The diffusion time, τ, is a measure of the average time a particle needs to traverse the confocal volume. The diffusion time is proportional to the cubic root of the mass. To distinguish two particles in solution, their diffusion times have to differ by a factor 1.6–2, meaning a 4–8-fold difference in mass (24Wohland T. Rigler R. Vogel H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2987-2999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 25Meseth U. Wohland T. Rigler R. Vogel H. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1619-1631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). (ii) A second parameter is the average total number of fluorescent particles, NF, in the confocal volume, which is directly proportional to the concentration. (iii) Another parameter is the mole fraction of different particles comprising NF when more than one type of particle is present. At any one time, not more than two different particles are present, and all measurements could be fitted with models assuming one or two particles in solution (22Wohland T. Friedrich K. Hovius R. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8671-8681Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26, Wohland, T., Friedrich, K., and Pick, H. (2001) in Nobel Conference Lectures (Rigler, R., Orrit, M., and Basché, T., eds) pp. 195–210, Springer-Verlag, BerlinGoogle Scholar). We therefore adopt the following convention. τDS is the diffusion time of the smaller particle. τDL is the diffusion time of the larger particle (τDL > τDS), and RL is the mole fraction of the large particles in solution. The fraction of the smaller particles is therefore 1 – RL. In Situ Monitoring of S3 Interaction with LPS Micelles by FCS—FCS was used to analyze the binding interaction between S3-TMR (Mr ∼4,000) and LPS from E. coli 0111:B4 (Mr ∼10,000; Ref. 27Aurell C.A. Wistrom A.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because of the closeness between the relative molecular weights of the two interacting components, the potential complexes of S3-TMR·LPS with a ratio ∼1:2.5 cannot be detected by FCS. However, complexes of S3-TMR and large LPS micelles, which exist in solution (28Neumann L. Wohland T. Whelan R.J. Zare R.N. Kobilka B.K. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), are detectable. Measurements were conducted at a constant concentration of 50 nm S3-TMR and different concentrations of LPS (0–1 μm). The sample solutions were prepared at least 2 h before the measurements to ensure that binding equilibrium had been reached. A 50-μl droplet of the corresponding sample was then placed on a coverslip just before the measurement. The background signal in water and in the corresponding buffers was less than 0.2 kHz. All measurements were precalibrated with TMR and S3-TMR to ensure proper performance of the instrument. For each sample, at least 10 independent measurements were recorded. To determine the effect of S3 on the LPS micelles, measurements were performed with unlabeled S3 on FITC-labeled LPS (FITC-LPS). Recordings were taken at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and calibrations were performed with FITC and FITC-LPS. In this case, the FITC-LPS concentration was fixed at 500 nm while different peptides were added, and the concentration of each peptide in solution was 10 μm. For sample preparation, the protocol described above was used. As control experiments, 0.2% Triton X-100, an LPS-active detergent known to be able to disrupt LPS (29Petsch D. Anspach F.B. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 76: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), was added to the solution of FITC-LPS, and the interaction was monitored by FCS. Endotoxin Neutralization Test—The recombinant Factor C (rFC) in the PyroGene kit is activated by LPS to catalyze the hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate to release a fluorescent product that is quantifiable at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 440 nm, respectively. In this assay, Sushi peptides, which bind to LPS to inhibit its endotoxic activity, were incubated at different concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C with or without an equal volume of LPS in disposable, endotoxin-free borosilicate tubes. Fifty μl of each mixture was then dispensed into wells of a sterile microtiter plate (Nunclon™ surface, Nunc), followed by the addition of 50 μl of freshly reconstituted recombinant Factor C reagent. After 30 min, the fluorescence of each well was monitored at 440 nm, and the concentration of peptides corresponding to 50% inhibition of recombinant Factor C activity was designated ENC50. Thus, the lower the ENC50 of the Sushi peptide, the greater is its ability to inhibit LPS. The Native S3 Peptide Forms Dimers via Intermolecular Disulfide Bonds—Separation of peptides less than 10 kDa is not possible in the traditional discontinuous PAGE system. This is because of the co-migration of SDS and smaller proteins, which obscures the resolution. However, the Tris-Tricine method that employs modified buffer conditions separates the peptides, thereby improving resolution. Fig. 1B shows that the molecular weights of the native S3 and mutant S3-C27S peptides in non-reducing buffer are about 8,000 and 4,000, respectively. In contrast, the molecular weights of the native S3 and mutant S3-C27S peptides in reducing buffer were about 4,000. This suggests that under physiological conditions, the native S3 peptides exist as dimers linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Furthermore, FCS measurements show that the number of fluorescent particles, NF, was doubled (Fig. 1C) when DTT was added to a solution of 50 nm S3-TMR. This shows that the S–S bond between two S3 peptides was broken by DTT, which is responsible for the increase in the number of free fluorescent S3-TMR molecules in solution. Disulfide Bond Stabilizes S3—Upon addition of DTT, the CD spectrum of S3 changes significantly with the loss of negative peaks at 205 and 215 nm (Fig. 2). These two peaks most likely represent stable secondary structures such as α-helices and β-sheets. Moreover, the minimum ellipticity is above 200 nm. This increase in the absolute values of mean residue ellipticity may be because of fewer monomeric conformers in solution and the stabilization of the dimer. The calculated content of secondary structure elements suggests distinctive dimers of S3 with predominant antiparallel β-sheet conformation (36.8% β-sheet, 22.8% α-helix). In contrast, the S3-C27S mutant peptide adopts a random coil conformation in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with the single minimum ellipticity observed at 195–200 nm, which is close to the spectrum of the native S3 monomer (in DTT). S3 Dimer Exhibits Higher Affinity for LPS Molecule—Anti-S3 antibody recognizes both S3 and S3-C27S peptides (Fig. 3A). The ELISA-based LPS binding assay revealed different binding capabilities between S3 and S3-C27S for LPS (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, at 2 μm, the S3 peptide reached saturation of binding to LPS, whereas the S3-C27S peptide continued linearly. Under these conditions, the native S3 is dimeric, whereas S3-C27S remains monomeric. This suggests that the S3 dimer has a higher affinity for LPS than the S3-C27S monomer. The real time binding analysis shows that the interaction between S3 and lipid A reached equilibrium during the injection of the sample. To compare the affinity of several Sushi peptides for E. coli lipid A, different kinds of peptides at the same concentration in buffer were injected across a lipid A-coated HPA chip. The sensorgrams revealed that the SPR signal intensity increased as a function of the concentration of the peptide bound to the immobilized lipid A (Fig. 3C). This indicates that the amount of peptide bound to lipid A is related to the affinity of the peptide for lipid A on the chip. At the same concentration, S3 dimer achieved 2-fold higher response units than the S3-C27S or S3 monomer, viz, S3 treated with DTT (Fig. 3C). The affinity of S3 dimer to negatively charged lipid A is higher than S3 monomer, similar to what has been obtained by ELISA. To exclude the possibility of the direct effect of DTT on the SPR signals, the binding interaction between S3-C27S in DTT and lipid A was performed. No significant change in affinity was observed between S3-C27S alone and S3-C27S in DTT. This indicates that intermolecular disulfide bonding plays a key role in the formation of the S3 dimer, which contributes to its elevated affinity for endotoxin. FCS Shows That the Native S3 Dimer Binds Avidly to and Disrupts LPS Micelles in Solution—Molecular interactions between two different molecules (LPS and S3 peptide) can be monitored by the diffusion time (τDL), the concentration of fluorescent particles (NF), and the fraction of bound complexes (RL). In both FCS experiments, one of two interacting components was labeled by a fluorescent dye, viz, either S3-TMR (Fig. 4A) or FITC-LPS (Fig. 4B). Upon binding of a small labeled peptide like S3-TMR to a large LPS micelle, the change in diffusion time is readily detected. In the absence of LPS micelles, only one diffusion time is detected (τ = 90 μs), representing the value of unbound freely diffusing S3-TMR. In the presence of LPS, the S3-TMR binds LPS micelles showing an increase in the average diffusion time of the sample (Fig. 4A). Proper fits are obtained only when assuming at least two different particles in solution, unbound S3-TMR (or small S3-TMR·LPS oligomeric complexes that are not sufficiently different in mass to be detected) and S3-TMR·LPS micellar complexes. The change in the LPS micelles during the interaction between FITC-LPS and S3 dimer is reflected by a decrease in τDL with a concomitant increase in the particle number, NF (Fig. 4B), during which the S3 peptide binds to FITC-LPS micelles to disrupt their micellar structure. Fig. 5 compares the binding relationship between S3-TMR and LPS, showing that S3-TMR dimer has stronger affinity for LPS than S3-TMR monomer. This result is consistent with those obtained from ELISA and SPR analyses. Thus, at the initial low concentrations of S3-TMR, the free form of S3-TMR is the predominant fluorescent species. During the course of the interaction, the percentage of the complex continuously increases as the ligand concentration is increased, as demonstrated by the increase in RL. A concomitant increase of τDL shows that with increasing LPS concentrations, larger LPS micelles are formed. This propensity of LPS to form larger micelles at higher concentrations was reported in literature (27Aurell C.A. Wistrom A.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To investigate the change in LPS micelles in the presence of S3, FITC-LPS was used in FCS experiments. A two-component fitting model was employed. The small component is free FITC-LPS (including FITC-LPS·S3 complexes), whereas the large component represents FITC-LPS micelles (including FITC-LPS micelle·S3 complexes). In the absence of S3, large fluorescent FITC-LPS micelles were present. During the interaction, the τDS is kept constant at 9.8 × 10–5 s, whereas the τDL and RL progressively decrease as the concentration of S3 peptide is increased; this indicates that the S3 dimer interacts with and perturbs the large LPS micelles while NF increases. S3 dimers rather than S3 monomers resulted in fewer LPS micelles (Fig. 6). In comparison with S3, high concentrations of magainin decreased τDL and RL and increased the particle number NF, which suggests that magainin can also disrupt LPS micelles. On the other hand, S3-C27S and S3 monomer did not cause significant change in RL or τDL, and NF remained constant (Fig. 6, A–C), suggesting that the S3 monomer is incapable of disrupting the LPS micelles even at high concentrations. As a system control for FCS measurements, it was shown that Triton X-100 interactions with LPS micelles differ from those of the S3 monomer (Fig. 6). Like the S3 dimer, 0.2% Triton X-100 interacts with FITC-LPS to decrease τDL and RL and to increase NF. The disruption of LPS micelles by Triton X-100 demonstrates the bona fide observation of disruption of LPS micelles seen under FCS, thus authenticating the ability of S3 dimer to disrupt LPS micelles. The Native S3 Dimer Inhibits LPS-induced Recombinant Factor C Activity—To examine the biological functionality of S3 peptides, a sensitive and precise fluorometric assay was used to assess the ability of native S3 and S3-C27S peptides to bind 50 enzyme units (EU)/ml endotoxin. Compared with the mutant S3-C27S peptide, which exists as a monomer, the native dimeric S3 peptide causes 10-fold greater inhibition of the LPS-induced recombinant Factor C activity (Fig. 7). A low ENC50 is indicative of the high potency of the peptide to neutralize LPS, with concomitant inhibition of the LPS-induced Factor C activity. The ENC50 values of the two peptides were determined to be 1 μm for S3 and >10 μm for S3-C27S. The Dimeric Rather than the Monomeric Form of S3 Displays Strong LPS-binding and -neutralizing Activity—As shown by Tricine PAGE and FCS, the native S3 peptides have a propensity to dimerize via an intermolecular disulfide bond (Fig. 1, B and C), which is responsible for its high affinity for LPS. The disulfide bond stabilizes the secondary structure of the S3 dimer (Fig. 2), in agreement with the report of Tam et al. (30Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Yang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50450-50456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Presumably, this structure is important for the interaction between S3 dimer and LPS, during which the S3 dimer forms a β-sheet structure to provide better shielding of the hydrophobic acyl chains of LPS (31Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). This may explain why the S3 dimer displays a stronger LPS-neutralizing capability than its monomeric counterpart. This possibility is clearly demonstrated and corroborated by the S3-C27S mutant, which as a monomer exhibits a complete structural changeover with a marked decrease in binding and a lack of suppression of LPS-induced toxicity. The strong affinity of S3 dimer for LPS is confirmed by a panel of experiments including SPR, ELISA, and FCS. SPR and ELISA are surface-based techniques, which may not represent the absolute interactive behavior of two molecular components in solution. However, it is consistently evident from all three experimental approaches that the S3 dimer, stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonding, exhibits a higher affinity for LPS (Fig. 3, B and C). Using FCS, we compared the activity of the peptides in solution. During titrations of S3-TMR with LPS, the dimer consistently showed stronger binding than the monomer as indicated by the larger fraction of RL and longer diffusion time (τDL) of peptides bound to LPS micelles at all concentrations. Furthermore, the FITC-LPS system revealed a decrease in τDL with an accompanying increase in the particle number NF, indicating that S3 dimers rather than their monomeric counterparts had disrupted the LPS micelles (Fig. 4). S3 Dimer Disrupts LPS Micelles via a “Detergent-like” Mechanism—By FCS analysis, S3 dimer and Triton X-100 apparently exhibited the same specific activities for LPS micelles (Fig. 6). S3 peptide was shown to attain a detergent-like activity after reaching a threshold concentration. This is consistent with the report by Bechinger (32Bechinger B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 can be employed in two-phase LPS extraction. Above the critical micellar concentration of Triton X-100, LPS micelles are disrupted by non-polar interactions between the alkyl chains of LPS and Triton X-100 and are consequently separated from the water phase (33Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar manner, it is possible that at high concentrations S3 dimer binds the acyl chains of LPS, thereby disrupting the critical force that maintains the stability of the LPS micelles. Besides hydrophobic interactions, it is important to consider the electrostatic forces between the peptide and LPS in aqueous solutions (34Frecer V. Ho B. Ding J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1466: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35Frecer V. Ho B. Ding J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 837-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Ding J.L. Zhu Y. Ho B. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2001; 759: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Near the N terminus of S3 there are several positively charged amino acids such as lysine residues, whereas the C terminus of S3 is more hydrophobic. The diphosphoryl head groups on the LPS confer a net negative charge, whereas its acyl chains are hydrophobic. S3 binds LPS through a preliminary interaction between the cationic amino acids at the N terminus of S3 and the diphosphoryl head groups of LPS, followed by stabilization of the resulting molecular complex through a hydrophobic interaction via the C terminus of S3 and fatty acyl chains of LPS (Fig. 8). This is in agreement with our previous observation that mutations of the N terminus to introduce two extra lysine residues into S3 resulted in an increase in LPS-neutralizing activity (16Tan N.S. Ng M.L. Yau Y.H. Chong P.K. Ho B. Ding J.L. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1801-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Considering the recent report that the aggregated form of LPS is biologically more active than the free LPS molecules (37Mueller M. Lindner B. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Schromm A.B. Seydel U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26307-26313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), disruption of the LPS micelles by S3 dimer peptides may be related to LPS neutralization. A Hypothetical Model for Peptide-LPS Interaction—Fig. 8 illustrates our proposed hypothetical model, which indicates that the dimeric form of S3 interacts preferentially with LPS molecules. This model may be summarized as follows. 1) Dimerization of S3 peptide occurs through an intermolecular disulfide bond. 2) At the initial low ratio of S3:LPS, binding of the S3 dimer to LPS micelle occurs via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. 3) As more S3 dimer accumulates at the local environment of the LPS micelle, the insertion of the peptide into the LPS layer initiates its disruption. When a threshold concentration of S3 dimer peptide is reached, perturbation of the LPS micelle is maximal, culminating in pore formation and complete disruption of the LPS layer. In contrast to the random S3 monomer peptide, which has weaker activity against LPS (Fig. 6), the S3 dimer is a symmetrically structured peptide. Therefore, we propose that in the interaction process, one S3 dimer binds two LPS molecules to form a complex constituting a trio of LPS·S3 dimer·LPS (Fig. 8, inset). In conclusion, we have documented the use of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy as a novel solution-based approach to monitor the molecular interaction between the S3 dimer peptide and LPS. In consideration with several other surface-based biochemical approaches, we demonstrate the critical role of the intermolecular disulfide bond in the dimeric S3 peptide, which displays detergent-like properties to bind avidly to LPS, equipping the S3 dimer to preferentially disrupt the LPS micelles. This activity is related to the β-sheet secondary structure, which confers stability to the S3 dimer for its prolonged and persistent interaction with and disruption of LPS micelles. The significance of the intermolecular disulfide bond to the activity of an antiendotoxin peptide suggests new ways to improve the future design of LPS-neutralizing peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2047784304,"Peroxisomes are responsible for several pathways in primary metabolism, including β-oxidation and lipid biosynthesis. PEX1 and PEX6 are hexameric AAA-type ATPases, both of which are indispensable in targeting over 50 peroxisomal resident proteins from the cytosol to the peroxisomes. Although the tandem AAA-ATPase domains in the central region of PEX1 and PEX6 are highly similar, the N-terminal sequences are unique.

The peroxisome is a single membrane organelle present in nearly all eukaryotic cells.

The initial step in peroxisome biogenesis involves the formation of the peroxisomal membrane, followed by transport of over 50 peroxisomal resident proteins, which are translated by free ribosomes in the cytosol. Biogenesis and maintenance of the peroxisome involves a protein transport system comprising more than 30 proteins, known as PEX gene products or peroxins (3Kunau W.H. Curr. Opin.

Ameritunga R. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The mutations in the PEX1 and PEX6 genes are found in different complementary groups of peroxisome biogenesis disorder patients, CG1 and CG4, respectively. PEX1 and PEX6 have been shown to associate with one another both in vitro and in vivo (16Faber K.N. Heyman J.A. Subramani S. Mol. Cell.

Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). AAA-ATPases, associated with various cellular activities, are hexameric ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes found in all three kingdoms of life (21Lupas A.N. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 22Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes play an important role in protein unfoldase activity, including the dissociation of protein complexes. AAA-ATPases are characterized by the presence of one or two copies of a well conserved catalytic ATPase domain comprising 220–250 amino acids. Most AAA family proteins are classified into two representative classes, type I and type II, which contain one and two copies of the AAA-cassette, respectively. In addition, an alternative classification of AAA-ATPases is possible in terms of the presence or absence of membrane integrated domains in their primary structures. Most of AAA-ATPases are cytosolic, whereas certain subfamilies contain N-terminal transmembrane helices (i.e. SF 6 based on Beyer's classification) (23Beyer A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2043-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The members belonging to the cytosolic type II AAA-ATPases, NSF and VCP (p97), have been extensively studied in terms of both function and structure. These enzymes form a hexameric ring and can act as a molecular chaperone. They reside on organelle membranes, where they play an important role in maintaining organelle function (24Rabouille C.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). NSF and its yeast ortholog, Sec18, is responsible for heterotypic membrane fusion mainly in exocytic pathways (26Whiteheart S.W. Kubalek E.W.

VCP and yeast CDC48 are involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (29Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Frohlich K.U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) as well as remodeling of the Golgi and nuclear membrane (24Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.M. Warren G.

Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Although the specific target of VCP unfoldase activity is not yet known, there are three specific adaptor molecules, p47 (30Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), Ufd1/Npl4 (31Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G.

Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), which differentiate the various cellular functions of VCP. In contrast, whereas the SNARE complex is known to be the specific target molecules for NSF, α-, β-, and γ-SNAPs were identified as the most important adaptor molecule for this function (34Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar, 35Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The two AAA-domains (D1 and D2) of PEX1 and PEX6 display a sequence identity of 19–28 and 29–52%, respectively (Fig. 1a). In contrast, the N-terminal sequences of PEX1 and PEX6 are quite different. We hypothesized that the N-terminal region may act to discriminate the characteristic functions of the two AAA-ATPases. We based our hypothesis on the following two observations. First, distinct functions of PEX1 and PEX6 are suggested by the different genetic complementation groups of cells from patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (13Tamura S. Okumoto K. Toyama R. Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Osumi T. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Reuber B.E. Germain-Lee E.

Braverman N. Suzuki Y. Shimozawa N. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 46: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Second, PEX15 and PEX26, both peroxisomal membrane-integrated proteins, have been identified as specific adaptor molecules for PEX6 (37Birschmann I. Stroobants A.K. van den Berg M. Schafer A. Rosenkranz K. Kunau W.H. Tabak H.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2226-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 38Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), but no specific adapter or putative substrate protein has been identified for PEX1 (39Eckert J.H. Johnsson N. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3623-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 40Fransen M. Brees C. Ghys K. Amery L. Mannaerts G.P. Ladant D. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mol.

Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R23.1-R23.3Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the function of PEX1, we focused on the unique amino acid sequence at the N terminus. The sequence has been subjected to extensive bioinformatics analyses coupled with biochemical experiments. The N terminus of PEX1 (residues 1–180) was found to be possess some similarity to the N terminus of VCP and NSF (<10% amino acid identity). Subsequently, the PEX1 N-terminal domain (NTD) was shown to independently fold as a globular domain. Finally, the crystal structure of PEX1 NTD, at 2.05-Å resolution, revealed a striking similarity to that of the “N-domains” of VCP and NSF. This kind of domain architecture is known as a “supradomain,” as found in many examples where two or three domains (in our case, NTD, D1, and D2) are evolutionally conserved in terms of their sequential order and biological context (42Vogel C. Berzuini C. Bashton M. Gough J. Teichmann S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Based on our “reversed” structural proteomics approach, a physiological function of PEX1 in peroxisome biogenesis is proposed. PSI-BLAST Analysis, FORTE Analysis, FUGUE Analysis, and Multiple Sequence Alignments of Proteins—The domain analysis of PEX1 and PEX6 orthologs was initially performed using SMART (43Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar) and PFAM (44Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). These servers failed to detect any domain at the N-terminal region of these proteins. To elucidate the relationship between the N-terminal region of PEX1 and homologous proteins at the primary amino acid sequence level, we performed extensive PSI-BLAST searches (45Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60210) Google Scholar) using our in-house Linux-based PC server against the nonredundant protein sequence data base. Specifically, we performed a PSI-BLAST search on the N-terminal segment of human PEX1 (residues 1–250), using a BLOSUM62 matrix and an expect value threshold of 0.003. Sequences containing a CDC48-2 domain (i.e. mouse VCP and hamster NSF, by SMART definition) were retrieved. We also performed a reverse PSI-blast search using these sequences. Based on the fact that the CDC48–2 domain associated with the CDC48-N domain, we subjected the N-terminal 192 residues of hamster VCP to a PSI-Blast, which successfully recovered the PEX1 sequence. A multiple alignment of sequences containing the entire N-terminal domain of PEX1 was constructed by collecting the “highest scoring pairs of sequence segments” using PSI-BLAST. These were manually realigned using ClustalW and ClustalX (46Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35617) Google Scholar). Based on this alignment, the C-terminal boundary of PEX1 NTD was judged to be around residue 180, in terms of the ratio of conserved amino acids within the PEX1 orthologs. This putative domain boundary was also predicted by the DomCut server (47Suyama M. Ohara O. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In order to confirm the distant relationships of PEX1 NTD to other known domain structures, we performed FORTE searches (48Tomii K. Akiyama Y. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 594-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). FORTE is a method that implements profile-profile comparisons to predict the structure of a query sequence. The existence of a domain at the N terminus of PEX1 with similarity to the N-domain of VCP was also confirmed by FUGUE search (49de Bakker P.I. Bateman A. Burke D.F. Miguel R.N. Mizuguchi K. Shi J. Shirai H. Blundell T.L. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 748-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 50Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). All protein sequences were extracted from ENTREZ. Construction of Expression Vectors and Domain Boundary Determination—GST fusion expression constructs containing the mouse PEX1 gene (encoding residues 3–180 or 3–131) and human PEX1 gene (encoding residues 3–180) were engineered according to the PRESAT vector methodology using an in-house pGEX-4T3-PRESAT vector (51Goda N. Tenno T. Takasu H. Hiroaki H. Shirakawa M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The GST fusion expression vectors containing the mouse PEX1 gene (encoding residues 3–263 and 3–310) were constructed according to a standard methodology. In brief, PCR-amplified cDNAs encoding the relevant regions of the PEX1 gene were first subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) according to the standard T/A-cloning protocol. The DNA was subsequently subcloned into pGEX-4T3 between the BamHI-EcoRI sites. Solubility of the GST-fused PEX1 N-terminal fragments was examined at the 10-ml culture scale. The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cultured in LBG medium at 30 °C. Protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were harvested 3 h after induction. The cells were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of sonication buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Expression and Purification of PEX1 NTD—Mouse PEX1 NTD, encoding residues 3–180, was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in LBG medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). The cells were grown to an A600 of 0.3, and heterologous gene expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were collected after 12–16 h of isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, pelleted, washed, and disrupted by sonication. Recombinant protein was purified by a single chromatography step using glutathione-Sepharose. The fusion protein GST-PEX1(3–180) was further purified for the structural studies. The GST tag was removed by treatment with thrombin. The protein solution was passed through a benzamidine-Sepharose 4B column and then purified by gel filtration using HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Biosciences). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of PEX1 NTD were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using a solution of ammonium sulfate and polyethylene glycol 4000 as described elsewhere (64Shiozawa K. Maita N. Tomii K. Seto A. Goda N. Akiyama Y. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Hiroaki H. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. 2004; 60: 2098-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group P32 with unit cell parameters of a = b = 63.5 Å and c = 33.5 Å. A summary of data collection statistics is given in Table I. Diffraction data of PEX1 NTD for native crystals were collected using an FR-D rotating anode x-ray generator with an R-AXIS IV++ Imaging Plate (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). The mercury-soaked data were collected at Photon Factory BL-6A with a Quantum R4 CCD detector (ADSC). The wavelength was set to 1.0080 Å with a crystal-to-detector distance of 180 mm and an exposure time of 9 s per degree of oscillation. All of the diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM (52Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

This was attributed mainly to a rather low sequence homology with both of these models as well as to structural differences. The structure was eventually solved by single isomorphous replacement using the anomalous scattering (SIRAS) method. The heavy atom data were merged with Native-2 data, followed by scaling with SCALEIT (53Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The heavy atom sites were searched using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion with SOLVE (56Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), followed by a SIR phase calculation with MLPHARE (53Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The initial phases (mean figure of merit of 0.57) were improved by a density modification procedure with RESOLVE (57Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar), resulting in a mean figure of merit of 0.83. The initial model output from RESOLVE was transferred to high resolution (2.05 Å) data (Native-1) by molecular replacement calculated with MOLREP (53Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). Further model building was done with O (58Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and the structure was refined with CNS (59Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse R.W.K. Jiang J.S.

The Ramachandran plot of the final model, containing 146 amino acid residues from 13–67 to 71–179 plus one sulfate ion and 51 water molecules, shows that all of the amino acid residues are in the most favored (91.1%) position and an additional allowed (8.9%) region defined by the program PROCHECK (60Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The structural determination and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Accessible surface areas were calculated using the Protein-Protein Interaction server (61Jones S. Thornton J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The figures are displayed by GRASP (62Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar), MolMol (63Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), and PyMol (64Shiozawa K. Maita N. Tomii K. Seto A. Goda N. Akiyama Y. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Hiroaki H. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. 2004; 60: 2098-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Structure comparison of PEX1 NTD against already defined structures was done using the DALI server (65Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar). Computational Sequence Analyses—Residues 1–600 of the N-terminal sequence of human PEX1, representing the preceding sequence to the D1 AAA-ATPase domain, was truncated into several pieces (∼250 amino acids) with various starting residues. Using these segments as query sequences, we scanned the protein nonredundant data base by PSI-Blast (45Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60210) Google Scholar). When residues 1–250 of human PEX1 were used as a query and the threshold was set to 0.003, we recovered the N-terminal part of mouse VCP and yeast CDC48 (∼140 residues) at the second iteration, with E values of 1 × 10–22 and 1 × 10–18, respectively. Further iterations recovered the N-terminal part of VAT, an archaeal homolog of VCP. All of these proteins belong to the type II AAA-ATPase family of enzymes. Since subsequent SMART analysis showed that the corresponding N-terminal sequences of VCP, CDC48, and VAT display similarity to the CDC48-2 domain, we assumed that PEX1 possesses a similar domain at the N terminus. The CDC48–2 domain is always found to accompany the CDC48-N domain and form a single domain of ∼180 amino acids at the N terminus of VCP, NSF, CDC-48, and VAT. This is referred to as the “N-domain.” Thus, the sequence containing the entire N-domain was subjected to a reverse PSI-BLAST search. Using N-terminal mouse VCP (residues 1–192), we recovered human and Arabidopsis PEX1 proteins (e.g. ID = 4505725, E = 4 × 10–4; ID = 30682405, E = 2 × 10–3, respectively) at the third iteration. Thus, on a statistical basis, we connected part of PEX1 NTD to the distant N-domain of type II AAA-ATPases. To find the boundary of this domain, the corresponding N-terminal sequences of ∼200 amino acids from PEX1 orthologs from other organisms were aligned using ClustalX (46Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35617) Google Scholar). The putative boundary of PEX1 NTD was defined at the position 180 ± 5. The putative PEX1 NTD sequences (residues 1–180) were subjected to analysis using the program FORTE (48Tomii K. Akiyama Y.

An oxygen-tolerant strain of HeLa cells, which proliferates even under 80% O2, termed “HeLa-80,” was derived from wild-type HeLa cells (“HeLa-20”) by selection for resistance to stepwise increases of oxygen partial pressure. Surprisingly, antioxidant defenses and susceptibility to oxidant-mediated killing do not differ between these two strains of HeLa cells. However, under both 20 and 80% O2, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is significantly (∼2-fold) less in HeLa-80 cells. In both cell lines the source of ROS is evidently mitochondrial. Although HeLa-80 cells consume oxygen at the same rate as HeLa-20 cells, they consume less glucose and produce less lactic acid. Most importantly, the oxygen-tolerant HeLa-80 cells have significantly higher cytochrome c oxidase activity (∼2-fold), which may act to deplete upstream electron-rich intermediates responsible for ROS generation. Indeed, preferential inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase by treatment with n-methyl protoporphyrin (which selectively diminishes synthesis of heme a in cytochrome c oxidase) enhances ROS production and abrogates the oxygen tolerance of the HeLa-80 cells. Thus, it appears that the remarkable oxygen tolerance of these cells derives from tighter coupling of the electron transport chain.

Damage to cells and tissues caused by hyperoxia is clinically important. For example, both lung damage and retrolental fibroplasia occur in premature infants given oxygen as therapy for pulmonary insufficiency. The risk of these complications is further amplified by the immaturity of cellular antioxidant defenses in premature infants (1Northway Jr., W.H. Rosan R.C. Radiology. 1968; 91: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similar pulmonary damage is also observed in adults who, on prolonged exposure to high partial pressures of inhaled O2, exhibit cough, shortness of breath, decreased vital capacity, and increased alveolar-capillary permeability (2Castro L. Freeman B.A. Nutrition. 2001; 17: 163-165Google Scholar, 3Mantell L.L. Lee P.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4Mao C. Wong D.T. Slutsky A.S. Kavanagh B.P. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 27: 2806-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Despite decades of work, it is still not known precisely how hyperoxia causes damage to cells and tissues. Nonetheless, it is commonly believed that free radicals play a key role in the pathophysiology of oxygen toxicity and cellular damage is probably mediated by increased production of ROS (5Gerschman R. Gilbert D. Nye S.W. Dwyer P. Fenn W.O. Nutrition. 2001; 17: 162PubMed Google Scholar). This excessive production of ROS likely derives from the mitochondria that, under conditions of high oxygen, exhibit increased electron leak from the electron transport chain (5Gerschman R. Gilbert D. Nye S.W. Dwyer P. Fenn W.O. Nutrition. 2001; 17: 162PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar, 7Li J. Gao X. Qian M. Eaton J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1460-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have approached the question of the nature of hyperoxic cell damage using a special line of HeLa cells selected for resistance to stepwise increases in the partial pressure of O2. These oxygen-tolerant HeLa cells are able to survive and grow under 80% O2, a partial pressure of oxygen under which normal HeLa cells and most other mammalian cells not only stop growing but die (8Joenje H. Gille J.J. Oostra A.B. Van der Valk P. Lab. Investig. 1985; 52: 420-428PubMed Google Scholar). If enhanced ROS production is, in fact, at the root of oxygen toxicity, then there are at least two ways in which cells might avoid oxygen toxicity: hypertrophied antioxidant defenses or lesser production of ROS. However, important antioxidant defenses, which include glutathione and related enzymes (glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase, and peroxiredoxins), ascorbic acid, vitamin E, catalase, superoxide dismutases (both the cytoplasmic Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase and the mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase) in the oxygen-tolerant HeLa cells are nearly identical to those in the wild-type HeLa-20 cells (8Joenje H. Gille J.J. Oostra A.B. Van der Valk P. Lab. Investig. 1985; 52: 420-428PubMed Google Scholar). This has two major implications. First, it indicates that the tolerance of these cells to high oxygen is probably not because of enhanced defenses against ROS. Second, many of these antioxidant enzymes are known to be induced by ROS. The fact that these enzymes display normal activities even in the tolerant HeLa cells exposed to high oxygen suggests that these cells somehow manage to avoid exaggerated ROS production even when exposed to high partial pressures of oxygen. Even under normoxic conditions, as much as 2–4% of the reducing equivalents escape the respiratory chain, initially as superoxide (O2.¯) and, hence, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (6Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar) (although other estimates of the extent of this electron leak are lower (9Alvarez S. Valdez L.B. Zaobornyj T. Boveris A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Genova M.L. Ventura B. Giuliano G. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Castelli G.P. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 11Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 857-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar)). Under hyperoxic conditions, mitochondrial ROS generation increases as a linear function of the oxygen tension (12Turrens J.F. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (3657) Google Scholar) and this has been implicated in cell dysfunction and death associated with hyperoxia (13Guidot D.M. McCord J.M. Wright R.M. Repine J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26699-26703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in attempting to understand the basis of oxygen tolerance in HeLa-80 cells, we focused our attention on ROS production. We find that the oxygen-tolerant HeLa cells produce less ROS under both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. In both wild-type and oxygen-tolerant HeLa cells, the protonophoric uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (a lipid soluble weak acid that carries protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane, thereby dissipating the proton gradient) almost completely blocks ROS production. This is probably because the consequent acceleration of electron transport leads to depletion of electron-rich intermediates (i.e. ubisemiquinone) at complexes III and I. This suggested to us that something similar might have somehow occurred in the oxygen-tolerant HeLa-80 cells. Indeed, although the activities of complexes I–III are very similar in HeLa-20 versus HeLa-80 cells, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is ∼2-fold higher in the oxygen-tolerant HeLa-80 cells. Furthermore, preferential blockade of this terminal complex of the mitchondrial electron transport chain, by treatment with n-methyl protoporphyrin (which selectively diminishes synthesis of heme a in cytochrome c oxidase), restores oxygen sensitivity of the HeLa-80 cells. These observations indicate that the oxygen tolerance of HeLa-80 cells arises from tighter “coupling” of the electron transport chain, thereby explaining both the decreased ROS production and increased oxygen tolerance of these unusual cells. Cells and Reagents—A wild-type strain of HeLa cells (HeLa-20 cells) and an oxygen-tolerant strain that grows normally under 80% oxygen were employed (8Joenje H. Gille J.J. Oostra A.B. Van der Valk P. Lab. Investig. 1985; 52: 420-428PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Ham's F-10 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Opti-MEM, phosphate-buffered saline, trypsin-EDTA, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA), dihydroethidium, and Amplex® Red were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Conditions of Cell Culture—HeLa cells were routinely cultured in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 1 mm glutamine and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum under 20% O2 (normoxia) or 80% O2 (hyperoxia) with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For routine passage, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lifted with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. Stock cultures were grown in polystyrene T-75 culture flasks in a Forma Scientific incubator under an atmosphere of 20% O2, 5% CO2. Exposure to hyperoxia was performed with cells grown in 10-cm dishes under an atmosphere of 80% O2, 15% N2 and 5% CO2 contained in a specially designed gas-tight modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc., Del Mar, CA). Because susceptibility to hyperoxia may vary with cell density (14Jyonouchi H. Sun S.N. Abiru T. Chareancholvanich S. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the initial cell number was routinely adjusted to ∼1 × 105 in F-10 medium. The sealed chamber was placed in a standard tissue culture incubator and the gas was replenished every 48 h. The survival and growth of cells were assessed over a period of 10 days by counting cell numbers in marked sectors of the culture dishes using light microscopy. It is important to note that the oxygen tolerance of HeLa-80 is a stable characteristic. Even after these cells have been continuously passed in normoxic culture for more than two months, they retain resistance to 80% O2. To avoid artifacts that might be introduced by the tendency of cell cultures to “drift,” cultures of both cell types were replenished from liquid nitrogen stabilates every 30 days and the oxygen tolerance of each new culture was checked. Peroxide-mediated Cytotoxicity—To determine whether oxygen tolerance might be associated with differences in oxidant sensitivity, the cytotoxic effects of both H2O2 and t-butyl hydroperoxide were measured. For these experiments, wild-type HeLa-20 and oxygen-tolerant HeLa-80 cells were grown in 48-well plates (initial density ∼2 × 104 cells per well in 0.5 ml of complete medium) for 3 days. When cells were >90% confluent, the medium was replaced by 1.0 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) and the cells were exposed to H2O2 or t-butyl hydroperoxide for 2 h at 37 °C without CO2. The HBSS was then replaced with complete medium. Following a 10-h culture under normal conditions (20% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C), Alamar Blue was added and, after a 4-h incubation, fluorescence of the reduced dye was measured at excitation of 530 nm and emission of 590 nm (15Nikolaychik V.V. Samet M.M. Lelkes P.I. J. Biomate. Sci. Polym. Ed. 1996; 7: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Nociari M.M. Shalev A. Benias P. Russo C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 213: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 17Page B. Page M. Noel C. Int. J. Oncol. 1993; 3: 473-476PubMed Google Scholar) using a spectrofluorometric plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Cell viability was calculated as the ratio of surviving cells to the original cell population. Estimation of ROS Production—ROS production was assessed by the oxidation of DCFDA, dihydroethidium, and Amplex® Red to ensure that the same proportionate differences were evident regardless of the probe employed. To estimate ROS production with DCFDA, cells were plated onto 48-well plates at an initial density of 2 × 104 cells per well and grown for 3 days. After cells were >90% confluent, they were washed 3 times with HBSS and, in some cases, treated with various inhibitors of respiration in 0.5 ml of HBSS for 5 min. Following the addition of 10 μm DCFDA (final concentration), the appearance of DCF fluorescence was followed continuously using a thermostated plate reading spectrofluorometer, typically for 1 h, at excitation of 486 nm and emission of 530 nm. Cell protein in each well was measured using the bicinchoninic acid reaction (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) (Pierce) and the DCF fluorescence was corrected for variations in total protein between wells. Generation of ROS was also evaluated under both 20 and 80% O2 using the oxidation of dihydroethidium (19Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated and grown as for experiments with DCFDA (above). When the cells were >90% confluent, fresh medium was added containing 100 μm dihydroethidium with or without 10 μm of the protonophoric uncoupler, CCCP. Dihydroethidium oxidation permits estimates of ROS formation over longer periods of time in complete culture medium and the product, ethidium, is held within the cell via intercalation into nucleic acids. After incubation with dihydroethidium for 4 h, cells were washed 3 times with HBSS and ethidium fluorescence was detected at excitation of 520 nm and emission of 610 nm. Again, the relative fluorescence was corrected for variations in cell protein between individual wells. A recent report suggests that the ethidium fluorescence specifically representing superoxide is best measured with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 567 nm (20Zhao H.T. Kalivendi S. Zhang H. Joseph J. Nithipatikom K. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). To ensure that the results obtained at our chosen wavelengths with excitation of 520 nm and emission of 610 nm were accurate, we directly compared the two conditions. We found a linear relationship between the fluorescence readings of these two pairs of wavelengths (excitation of 480 nm and emission of 567 nm versus excitation of 520 nm and emission of 610 nm, r = 0.99; n = 4). A third fluorescent dye, Amplex® Red, was also used to estimate cellular ROS generation. In the presence of horseradish peroxidase and H2O2, Amplex® Red is oxidized to the highly fluorescent product, resorufin (21Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). For these experiments, cells were incubated with assay medium (phenol-free Opti-MEM containing 4% fetal bovine serum) in the presence of 50 μm Amplex® Red and 0.1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase under 20 or 80% O2 for 3 h. Fluorescence was detected at excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. A background fluorescence measured in the absence of cells was subtracted from experimental values and the relative fluorescence was corrected for measured cell protein as above. Lactate Production—Cells cultured as above were incubated for periods of up to 24 h, and lactate accumulation in the medium was determined. These assays were carried out using lactate dehydrogenase-mediated conversion of lactate to pyruvate and hydrazine as a trap for the product (22Gloster J.A. Harris P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1962; 7: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured spectrophotometrically and results were expressed as nanomole of lactate formed per milligram of cell protein per unit time. Glucose Consumption—The consumption of glucose by the same cultures was measured using hexokinase-mediated formation of glucose 6-phosphate followed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-dependent reduction of NADP to NADPH. The change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured spectrophotometrically and results were expressed as nanomole of glucose consumed per milligram of cell protein per unit time (23Trinder P. J. Clin. Pathol. 1969; 22: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Glutamine Consumption—The consumption of glutamine was measured as described by Passonneau and Lowry (24Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press, c1993, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar) in a two-step enzymatic reaction. The first reaction was carried out by glutaminase-mediated formation of glutamate at pH 4.9. The second reaction was followed by glutamate dehydrogenase-dependent reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured spectrophotometrically and results were expressed as nanomole of glutamine consumed per milligram of cell protein per unit time (25Reitzer L.J. Wice B.M. Kennell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2669-2676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen Consumption—HeLa cell cultures in T-75 flasks (>90% confluent) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, detached with trypsin/EDTA, and washed (1,000 × g x 10 min) in complete culture medium. Oxygen consumption was measured using a Gilson Oxygraph with a Clark electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments Co., Yellow Springs, OH). Respiration rates were measured using 3–5 × 106 cells suspended in a total volume of 3.0 ml of Ham's F-10 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 17 mm glutamate at 37 °C. A starting O2 concentration of 240 μm was assumed based on O2 solubility at sea level at 37 °C (26Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Estimation of Mitochondrial Protein Carbonyls—Mitochondria were prepared by differential centrifugation using a modification of the procedure described by Fuller et al. (27Fuller K.M. Duffy C.F. Arriaga E.A. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on 10-cm dishes were washed twice with cold mitochondrial isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The cells were diluted in this isolation buffer to 8 × 106 cells/ml and disrupted by nitrogen cavitation at 4 °C using an ice-cooled cell disruption bomb (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL). Following removal of large debris by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain crude mitochondrial pellets. The total carbonyl content of mitochondrial proteins was determined by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine using a slight modification of the method of Levine et al. (28Levine R.L. Garland D. Oliver C.N. Amici A. Climent I. Lenz A.G. Ahn B.W. Shaltiel S. Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial pellets containing ∼300 μg of protein were incubated with 500 μl of 10 mm 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 2 m HCl at room temperature for 1 h with intermittent mixing. Following addition of 500 μl of 20% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, the samples were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets were washed 3 times with 1 ml of ethanol:ethyl acetate (1:1) to remove unreacted 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. The protein pellet was redissolved in 0.6 ml of 6 m guanidine with 20 mm K2HPO4 (pH adjusted to 2.3 with 20% trichloroacetic acid) at 37 °C and any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 3 min. The carbonyl content in the supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically at 375 nm. Results were calculated using ϵ = 22,000 m–1 cm–1 and normalized for protein concentration. Aconitase Assay—Cells (∼5 × 106) were detached with trypsin/EDTA and washed with HBSS (1,000 × g for 10 min). The cells were suspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.6 mm MnCl2 and disrupted by 10 1-s bursts from a microtip sonic oscillator (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The lysate was transferred to a chilled 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. MnCl2 was included in the lysis buffer to limit the inactivation of aconitase by O2.¯ during extract preparation (29Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 2,000 × g, and the supernatants were promptly assayed for total aconitase activity, following the linear absorbance change at 340 nm at 25 °C in a 1.0-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm sodium citrate, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm NADP, 2 units of isocitrate dehydrogenase, and 50 μg of extract protein. One milliunit of aconitase activity was defined as the amount catalyzing the formation of 1 nmol of isocitrate per min. An initial lag in NADPH formation was seen in samples with low aconitase activity, which presumably reflects the delayed accumulation of cis-aconitate (30Gardner P.R. Nguyen D.D. White C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12248-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In these cases, the linear rates during the latter half of a 60-min assay were used for the determinations of aconitase activity. Results were corrected for measured protein concentrations. COX Assay—Lysates of fresh cells (directly counted and adjusted to 6 × 106 cells/ml) were prepared by suspension in 0.25 m sucrose, 40 mm potassium chloride, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and disruption by 10 1-s bursts from a microtip sonic oscillator (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The lysate was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant was used for COX assay (31Jarreta D. Orus J. Barrientos A. Miro O. Roig E. Heras M. Moraes C.T. Cardellach F. Casademont J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Assays contained ∼50 μg of protein and were performed at 37 °C in 1-ml reaction volumes. The assay involved the addition of 60 μm ferrocytochrome c in an isosmotic medium (10 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.5, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.3 m sucrose) containing 2.5 mmn-dodecylmaltoside to permeabilize mitochondrial membranes (31Jarreta D. Orus J. Barrientos A. Miro O. Roig E. Heras M. Moraes C.T. Cardellach F. Casademont J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The activity was calculated from the rate of decrease in absorbance of ferrocytochrome c at 550 nm (ϵ = 19.1 mm–1cm–1) (32Kruidering M. Van De Water B. De Heer E. Mulder G.J. Nagelkerke J.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 638-649PubMed Google Scholar) and results were normalized for protein. In addition, because accurate estimations of COX activity could be compromised by variations in mitochondrial yield and integrity, results were also normalized using an invariant marker of mitochondrial enzyme activity, citrate synthase (see below). Citrate Synthase Assay—This assay was performed as described by Williams et al. (33Williams A.J. Coakley J. Christodoulou J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. It is based on the reaction of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to produce coenzyme A (CoASH), the latter being detected by dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), which reacts with sulfhydryls in CoASH producing free thionitrobenzoate. Eight hundred μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (K2HPO4 and KH2PO4, pH 7.4) was warmed to 37 °C and then 10 μl of crude mitochondrial extract was added along with dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) and acetyl-CoA in final concentrations of 100 μm each. The reaction was started by addition of 100 μm oxaloacetate. The change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored for 30 min (reflecting the formation of thionitrobenzoate) and results were expressed as nanomole/min/mg of protein. The citrate synthase activity was calculated from the change in absorbance using ϵ = 13.6 mm–1 cm–1 (34Bejma J. Ji L.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1999; 87: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Cell Culture in the Presence of n-Methyl Protoporphyrin (NMP)— NMP, an inhibitor of ferrochelatase, preferentially decreases the synthesis of heme a and, therefore, the activity of cytochrome c oxidase (35Atamna H. Liu J. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48410-48416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 36Gamble J.T. Dailey H.A. Marks G.S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 373-375PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells (initial density ∼5 × 104 per 10-cm dish) were treated with 5 μm NMP for 9 days under both normoxia and hyperoxia. Medium was changed every 4 days. A previous study showed that the enzymatic activity of COX can be decreased by as much as 85% in cells grown in the presence of NMP (37Tangeras A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 882: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Twelve h after initial plating, cells were treated with 5 μm NMP in complete medium under normal conditions (20% O2) for 24 h, prior to exposure to 80% O2. Control cultures were carried out under 20% O2 to detect possible drug effects on cell growth. HeLa-80 Cells Are Tolerant to Hyperoxia—We began by affirming the previously reported oxygen tolerance of the HeLa-80 cells (8Joenje H. Gille J.J. Oostra A.B. Van der Valk P. Lab. Investig. 1985; 52: 420-428PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (and previously reported (8Joenje H. Gille J.J. Oostra A.B. Van der Valk P. Lab. Investig. 1985; 52: 420-428PubMed Google Scholar)), when cultured under 80% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C, wild-type HeLa-20 cells ceased growing after 5–6 days and then underwent extensive cell death. In contrast, the HeLa-80 cells grew normally throughout 10 days of exposure to 80% O2. As also shown in Fig. 1, both HeLa-20 and HeLa-80 cells exhibited normal replication under normoxic conditions. HeLa-20 and HeLa-80 Cells Are Equally Susceptible to Oxidant-mediated Killing—We reaffirmed earlier reports (8Joenje H. Gille J.J. Oostra A.B. Van der Valk P. Lab.

In view of earlier reports that elevated heme oxygenase-1 might protect against hyperoxia-induced lung damage (39Lee P.J. Alam J. Wiegand G.W. Choi A.M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As a more direct test of the overall oxidant defenses of these two cell lines, we tested cell killing by increasing amounts of both H2O2 and t-butyl-hydroperoxide. As shown in Fig. 2, these two cell lines show nearly identical killing by both of these oxidants. For H2O2, LD50 is 140 ± 21 and 125 ± 28 μm, n = 4; for t-butylhydroperoxide, LD50 is 470 ± 35 and 410 ± 62 μm, n = 4; for HeLa-20 and HeLa-80, respectively. Oxygen-tolerant HeLa-80 Cells Exhibit Decreased ROS Production in Both Normoxia and Hyperoxia—The lack of significant differences in antioxidant defenses between these two cell lines directed our attention to possible changes in the production of ROS by HeLa-20 versus HeLa-80 cells. This was first estimated using the fluorescent probe DCFDA. This cell-permeable non-fluorescent probe enters cells by passive diffusion whereupon the two acetate groups are esterolytically cleaved. Within the cell, the probe can be oxidized in a reaction that requires H2O2 and a peroxidase or pseudoperoxidase (such as cytochrome c or redox-active iron) yielding highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein. The results (Fig. 3A) indicate that the steady-state production of ROS by th"

However, the mechanism by which TNFalpha acts at the cellular level is not totally understood. Although apoptotic cell killing appears to be the most common cellular effect of TNFalpha, other studies suggest that this cytokine may elicit other cellular responses such as prolonged growth inhibition. In this context, we have investigated whether TNFalpha may induce senescence in hematopoietic cells, which display intrinsic defect in the apoptotic machinery. The present study described that, in the leukemic KG1 cells, TNFalpha induced no apoptosis but a senescence state characterized by prolonged growth arrest, increased beta-galactosidase activity, p21WAF-1 induction, decreased telomerase activity, telomeric disturbances (shortening, losses, fusions), and additional chromosomal aberrations. Telomerase inhibition correlated with reduced levels of hTERT transcripts. GM-CSF prevented TNFalpha effects and allowed leukemic cells to recover growth capacity. Finally, our study shows for the first time that, at least in some hematopoietic cells, TNFalpha may induce senescence with important functional consequences, including sustained growth inhibition and genetic instability, and that this cellular response is efficiently regulated by hematopoietic growth factors."

Looking at Ubiquitin Chain Assembly♦Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 279Issue 45PreviewUbiquitin-conjugating enzymes help to activate ubiquitin for labeling damaged or misfolded proteins for degradation. The most basic (class I) ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes consist of a 150-residue catalytic domain responsible for forming a thiol ester ubiquitin intermediate. The more complex class II proteins have C-terminal extensions on their catalytic domains and are involved in creating polyubiquitin chains. Although three-dimensional structures have been solved for numerous ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, these structures all consist solely of the catalytic core domain. Full-Text PDF Open Access Labeling of proteins with the molecule ubiquitin is an important cellular function that is required for protein degradation, cell cycle control, stress response, DNA repair, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and vesicular traffic (1Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar, 3Hicke L.

In this process, the number and topology of the ubiquitin molecule chains underscores the fate of the substrate and determines the biochemical pathway followed. For example, labeling the substrate with a single ubiquitin (monoubiqutination) is important for cellular regulation (5Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 6Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Hofmann K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). On the other hand ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, the process responsible for the turnover of damaged or misfolded proteins in the cell, involves labeling the substrate protein with a polyubiquitin chain that is subsequently recognized by the 26 S proteasome facilitating substrate degradation. The most common polyubiquitin chains are formed via isopeptide bond linkages between the C-terminal (Gly76) of one ubiquitin molecule and the side chain ϵ-NH2 from Lys48 of another. However, other configurations are possible including the Lys63 linkage, which are important in the postreplicative DNA repair pathway (7Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination degradation pathway is described as a cascade of events in which ubiquitin is passed through three enzymes until it reaches a protein selected for degradation. The first step involves an ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin by an ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. forming a high energy E1-ubiquitin thiol ester complex. The activated ubiquitin is then passed from the E1 to an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) forming a second thiol ester intermediate between the E2 and ubiquitin. Labeling the target protein with ubiquitin is catalyzed by an E3 ligase protein, either by direct transfer of the ubiquitin to the substrate from the E2 (RING E3) or by thiol ester formation between ubiquitin to an E3 (HECT E3) and subsequent transfer to the substrate (4Passmore L.A. Barford D. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Some details of this ubiquitin-mediated cascade have been garnered from the structures of several E2 enzymes showing a core 150-residue catalytic α/β fold that is maintained upon complexation with either a HECT (8Huang L.

While these structures show the interactions between the E2, E3, and ubiquitin proteins, details how the transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate occurs and how the polyubiquitin chain is constructed are more uncertain. More recently, three-dimensional structures of the heterodimeric complex between the canonical E2 protein Ubc13 in complex with an E2 variant protein Mms2 have shown how these proteins function together to assemble Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains (12VanDemark A.P.

Similar structural details for construction of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains are not available, although it has been suggested that dimeric forms of other E2 proteins might also be required (15Ptak C.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6296-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The E2 conjugating proteins are considered key enzymes in the ubiquitination pathway. All E2 proteins have a 150-residue catalytic domain that is structurally conserved through many species. For example, 11 E2 proteins have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and at least 25 are known in mammals. E2 proteins are divided into three classes in which class I enzymes are the simplest and are comprised exclusively of the core catalytic domain that contains the active site cysteine residue required for thiol ester formation with ubiquitin. Several E2 proteins are more complex than the class I members and have either N- or C-terminal extensions. Class II E2 proteins have a C-terminal extension or a “tail,” whereas class III E2 proteins have an additional N-terminal sequence (17Jentsch S. Seufert W. Sommer T. Reins H.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 195-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). One of the key functions of the class II E2 conjugating enzymes is the creation of the polyubiquitin chain required for protein labeling and subsequent degradation. For example the mammalian E2 protein E2-25K is able to synthesize free Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains in the absence of an E3 enzyme (18Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E2 proteins Ubc1 and Ubc3 (Cdc34) from S. cerevisiae are able to assemble polyubiquitin chains in conjunction with an auto-ubiquitination activity (16Gwozd C.S. Arnason T.G. Cook W.J. Chau V. Ellison M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6296-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Hodgins R. Gwozd C. Arnason R. Cummings M. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28766-28771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A variety of other mechanistically distinct functions have been identified for the C-terminal extensions in class II E2 enzymes including dimerization (20Leggett D.S. Candido E.P.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), substrate recognition (21Gosink M.M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9117-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and anchoring of specific E2 enzymes to the cystolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (22Sommer T. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 365: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Despite the diverse range of functions, and the integral nature of class II E2 conjugating proteins in the ubiquitination pathway, a three-dimensional structure of one of these proteins has not been reported. In this work we present the solution structure of the 215-residue protein Ubc1, a class II E2 conjugating enzyme from S. cerevisiae shown to be important for degradation of short-lived proteins especially during the G0-G1 transition accompanying spore germination (23Seufert W. McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We show that Ubc1 is a unique two-domain E2 enzyme containing a canonical catalytic domain and a C-terminal UBA domain separated by a flexible tether. Furthermore, we have used NMR chemical shift analysis to determine that ubiquitin binds to the Ubc1 UBA domain with little or no perturbation of the catalytic domain. Our structural results and sequence analysis indicate several other class II E2 proteins, including mammalian E2-25K, likely have this two domain architecture. We have used this information to provide insights into Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chain formation by these class II E2 enzymes. Protein Expression and Purification—Uniformly 15N- and 15N,13C-labeled Ubc1(R48K) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain and purified as described previously (24Merkley N. Shaw G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Uniformly 2H,15N,13C-labeled and Val, Leu, Ile (δ1) methyl-protonated 15N,13C,2H-labeled Ubc1 were expressed in 1 liter of M9 minimal media containing 1.0g/L 99% of 15NH4Cl, 2.0 g/liter of 99% [13C6; 1,2,3,4,5,6,6-2H7]glucose in 100% D2O (25Gardner K.H.

For the Val, Leu, Ile (δ1) methyl-protonated 15N,13C,2H-labeled protein, [13C5;3-2H]α-ketoisovaleric acid, sodium salt (85 mg/liter) and [13C4;3,3-2H2]α-ketobutyric acid, sodium salt (50 mg/liter) were added 1 h before induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and induced for a maximum of 4 h (26Goto N.K. Gardner K.H. Mueller G.A. Willis R.C. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Fractionally 13C-labeled Ubc1 was prepared by growing the cells in minimal M9 media with a 1:10 mixture of 99% [13C6]glucose and unlabeled glucose (27Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Pure protein fractions from gel filtration chromatography were pooled and concentrated. NMR samples were prepared at pH 7.5 in 90% H2O/10% D2O (v/v) with a final concentration of 0.48 mm. Samples in 100% D2O were prepared by exchanging buffer with 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 150 mm NaCl in 100% D2O using an ultrafiltration cartridge (Mr cutoff 10,000). NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Determination—NMR experiments were acquired at 35 °C on Varian 500-, 600-, or 800-MHz spectrometers with pulse field gradient triple resonance probes. Sequential assignments for the backbone residues were made from HNCA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, 15N-edited TOCSY, and 1H-15N HSQC experiments (28Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn.

Resonance assignments for the 1H, 13C, and 15N atoms have been deposited in the BioMagResBank under the accession number BMRB-6202 (www.bmrb.wisc.edu). Stereospecific assignment of the prochiral methyl groups from valine and leucine was achieved from analysis of a constant time 1H-13C HSQC experiment using a fractionally 13C-labeled Ubc1 sample. Interproton distances were measured from 15N-NOESY (mixing time 150 ms) (31Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol.

Amide-amide interproton distances were measured from an 15N-NOESY with a mixing time of 300 ms, collected on a Varian INOVA 600-MHz spectrometer using an uniformly 2H,13C,15N-labeled Ubc1 sample. Assignment of the leucine, valine methyl and isoleucine (Cδ1, Hδ1) protons, and 13C resonances were facilitated using a sample of Val, Leu, Ile (δ1) methyl-protonated 15N,13C,2H-labeled Ubc1 in which the C(CO)NH and HC(CO)NH afforded correlations exclusively with these methyls. Methyl-methyl interproton distances were measured from a methyl-methyl NOE experiment (mixing time: 100 ms) (33Zwahlen C. Gardner K.H. Sarma S.P. horita D.A. Byrd R.A. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7617-7625Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and 13C-NOESY (13C carrier set to 19.6 ppm; 13C spectral window: 3200 Hz; mixing time: 100 ms) using the selective methyl-protonated sample of Ubc1. Heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOEs were measured using the methods of Farrow et al. (34Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E.

Experiments were done in triplicate and averaged. 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings were measured using IPAP-HSQC experiments (35Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) using a 0.4 mm sample of 15N-labeled Ubc1 in 12 mg/ml pf1 phage. NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (36Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11566) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Pipp and Stapp (37Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar) or NMRView (38Johnson B.A. Belvins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar) software using a Sun Ultra 10 workstation. Structures of Ubc1 were calculated using the simulated annealing protocol in the program CNS (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

The structures of Ubc1 were generated from 1864 NOEs, including 858 intraresidue, 363 sequential, 357 short range and 286 long range and 63 hydrogen bond distance restraints, 194 dihedral angle restraints, and included 29 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings for residues 170–215. Interproton distances were calibrated for all proton pairs using maximum and minimum nOe intensities for known possible dNHα distances. Dihedral restraints were determined from the program TALOS (torsion angle likelihood obtained from shifts and sequence similarity) (40Cornilescu G. Delagio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) based on the Cα, Cβ, C′, Hα, and N chemical shift information for Ubc1 where 9 out of 10 predictions fell in the same region of the Ramachandran plot. The resulting φ and Ψ angles were restricted to two times the error from the TALOS output for the structure calculations. Hydrogen bonds were identified from the slowly exchanging NH residues after 2-h incubation after solvent exchange. For each hydrogen bond, two distance restraints were used, NH–O (1.8–2.3 Å) and N–O (2.3–3.3 Å). 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings were included in the structure calculations with a precision equal to the digital resolution of the HSQC spectra (±0.75 Hz). Values for Da and R were estimated from the program DYNAMO using a preliminary fold from CNS trials and measured 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings. Final and initial force constants were 0.01 and 1.0 kcal/mol, respectively. Structural similarity searches were performed using the DALI web server (41Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar), and sequences were aligned using T-Coffee (42Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5476) Google Scholar). Ubc1-Ubiquitin Titrations—The equilibrium dissociation constant for the Ubc1-ubiquitin complex was measured by NMR spectroscopy using 1H-15N HSQC experiments. 15N,13C-labeled Ubc1 was titrated with increasing amounts of unlabeled ubiquitin up to 4 equivalents. Protein samples were made up in 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.5 in 10% D2O/90% H2O (v/v), and protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis, ubiquitin (14.9 mm) and Ubc1 (0.48 mm). 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded after each ubiquitin addition. Chemical shift deviations were calculated for each isolated residue that underwent a significant change. Non-linear regression analysis assumed a single binding site (43Marsden B.J. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4198-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and were fitted using the software Prism 4. Five NMR samples of 100 μm15N-labeled ubiquitin in 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.5 (10% D2O/90% H2O) with increasing concentrations of unlabeled Ubc1 (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 equivalents) were used to measure the chemical shift perturbation of ubiquitin upon binding the C-terminal tail. 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded for each sample and chemical shifts changes were quantified using the equation ΣΔδ = 0.5(|Δδ(1H)| + 0.125*|Δδ(15N)|). Coordinate Deposition—The atomic coordinates for the structures of Ubc1 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 1TTE. The Class II E2 Enzyme Ubc1 Is a Flexible Two-domain Protein—The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc1 from S. cerevisiae is a typical class II E2 enzyme possessing a 150-residue catalytic domain and a 65-residue C-terminal tail region. The length of the C terminus is intermediate of those found for Ubc2 (23 residues) (44Morrison A. Miller E.J. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and Ubc3 (125 residues) (15Ptak C. Prendergast J.A. Hodgins R. Kay C.M. Chau V. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26539-26545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of Ubc1 was determined by NMR spectroscopy using standard triple resonance and 15N-edited, 13C-edited, and methyl-specific NOE experiments. A family of 21 structures was chosen (Fig. 1) based on their low energy and the absence of distance violations (Table I). The structure of Ubc1 contains two individually well defined domains tethered by a 22-residue linker. The first 150 residues of Ubc1 (Fig. 1, B and C) comprise the catalytic domain of the enzyme defined by four α-helices (α1, Lys5–Ala13; α2, Leu102–Leu113; α3, Ala124–Leu131; α4, Arg134–Leu147) and four β-strands (β1, Ile22–Phe26; β2, His34–Leu40; β3, Lys51–Val58; β4, Lys68–Gln70). This domain is well defined having a backbone r.m.s.d. of 0.78 ± 0.12 Å. The α/β fold of Ubc1 is similar to that observed in crystal structures of class I E2 proteins including Ubc2 (45Worthylake D.K. Prakash S. Prakash L. Hill C.P. J. Biol.

For example, the r.m.s.d. for the backbone atoms (N, Cα, C′) in Ubc1 to those for the x-ray crystal structure of a truncated mutant of Ubc1 (residues 1–150) (11Hamilton K.S. Ellison M.J. Barber K.R.

The catalytic cysteine in Ubc1, Cys88, is located below helix α2, in a position common to all E2 conjugating enzyme structures to date.Table IStructural statistics for the 21 lowest energy structures of Ubc1Restraints for structure calculationsaAll statistics were calculated from a family of 21 structuresIntraresidue NOEs858Sequential NOEs363Short range NOEs357Long range NOEs286Hydrogen bonds63Dihedral angles194NH residual dipolar couplings29b15N-1H residual dipolar couplings were included for α5, α6, and α7 of the tail domain of Ubc1Energies (kcal mol-1)ENOE17.9 ± 1.8Ecdih0.76 ± 0.23Erepel58.26 ± 9.35EL-JcLennard-Jones van der Waals energy was calculated using CHARMM empirical energy and was not included in the structure calculation-560.1 ± 29.3Esani20.6 ± 2.7r.m.s.d. from experimental restraintsDihedral angles (°)0.25 ± 0.04Distances (Å)0.011 ± 0.006r.m.s.d. from idealized geometryBond (Å)0.0014 ± 0.00008Bond angles (°)0.309 ± 0.007Improper torsions (°)0.168 ± 0.010Residual dipolar couplingsr.m.s.d.

Helix α5, which starts immediately after the tether region, runs roughly in the same direction as α7 (Ω5,7 = 54 ± 5°). These two helices are separated by helix α6, which lies across both helices α5 and α7 (Ω5,6 = 128 ± 3°, Ω6,7 = 130 ± 3°). The core of the three-helix bundle in Ubc1 is composed of Ile173 and Phe176 (α5) that pack against residues Ile186 and Leu190 (α6) and Ile209, Ile210, and Leu213 (α7). A 12-residue segment located between helices α6 and α7 forms an extended loop. This region is largely solvent exposed consistent with its high proportion of polar residues. The exceptions are Leu193, Val195, and Leu198 that cluster with Thr205 (α7) and Leu172 (α5) and Lys196 that interacts with Ile168 prior to helix α5. Together these contacts force the loop between helices α6 and α7 to lean toward the N terminus of helix α5. A 22-residue flexible tether links the catalytic domain of Ubc1 to its C-terminal domain. During the structure calculations it became apparent this connecting region contained little regular structure due to the absence of long range NOE contacts to either the catalytic or C-terminal domains and the observation of very few sequential and short range NOEs. Furthermore, no long range NOEs between the catalytic domain and C-terminal domain were observed, indicating that they must be isolated from each other. Previous chemical shift perturbation studies indicated that the C-terminal domain might interact with the catalytic domain, proximal to the start of the tether region (Ser150). The structure of Ubc1 (Fig. 1A) shows that the C-terminal domain adopts many orientations with respect to the catalytic domain, most which envelope the β1, β2, and α4 regions, the sites of the largest chemical shift changes observed previously. Since NOEs were not observed between the two domains it would appear that the chemical shift changes are largely a result of transient interactions or the proximity of the C-terminal domain (in sequence) to the catalytic domain junction. To establish the relationship between the domains, 15N{1H} heteronuclear NOE experiments were performed to determine whether the two domains had similar relaxation properties that would indicate a more globular structure or different properties that would indicate a more elongated structure with two independent domains. Analysis of the 15N{1H} heteronuclear NOE measurements indicated there was a clear difference between the average NOE from the catalytic and the C-terminal domains (Fig. 2). The catalytic domain had an average NOE of about 0.72, consistent with a τm of about 4.4 ns. This average NOE was very similar to that obtained for UBC9 (0.74), a 15-kDa ubiquitin-like conjugating enzyme that lacks a C-terminal domain (49Liu Q. Yuan Y.-C. Shen B. Chen D.J. Chen Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). UBC9 displays a similar α/β tertiary fold when compared with the catalytic domain of Ubc1 and also exhibits a more oblate shape, typical of the structures of other E2 catalytic domains. In contrast the C-terminal domain of Ubc1 had an average NOE of about 0.56, indicating that it has a smaller volume than the catalytic domain and is not associated with it. The average NOE for the C-terminal domain translates to a τm of about 2.6 ns. From this value, an approximate molecular mass of 5 kDa is estimated, in excellent agreement with that expected for residues His170–Lys215 (4.9 kDa). Furthermore, the heteronuclear NOE experiments showed that residues Asn154, Gly155, Gln156, and Lys157 had negative NOE values indicative of a region with high mobility on the nanosecond time scale. These observations are similar to those found for other bilobate proteins such as calmodulin (50Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A.

During the past decades, β-lactamase production (EC 3.5.2.6) has become a significant problem in bacterial strain resistance to widely used clinical antibiotics. Among these enzymes, the prevalent type has always been the Class A active site serine hydrolase β-lactamases, which have become model enzymes extensively studied by protein engineering with respect to site-directed or combinatorial mutagenesis (1Orencia M.C.

Over the years Escherichia coli TEM-1 β-lactamase has become an impressive example of the rapid evolution rate of proteins occurring within natural bacterial isolates subjected to selective pressure. Ever since the clinical introduction of β-lactam compounds and the discovery of TEM-1 β-lactamase, both in the 1940s (14Abraham E.P. Chain E. Nature. 1940; 146: 837Crossref Scopus (558) Google Scholar), natural mutations have generated a large number of single and multiple mutants of this enzyme (for an extensive list see www.lahey.org/Studies/temtable.asp). The high rate of occurrence of mutated enzymes capable of hydrolyzing higher generation cephalosporins has stimulated research of β-lactamase adaptation to these new substrates in order to understand the molecular basis of this evolutionary chain of events. Consequently, a number of studies have successfully predicted the in vitro appearance of new mutations conferring resistance before their appearance in natural isolates (for an overall view, see Ref 1Orencia M.C. Yoon J.S. Ness J.E. Stemmer W.P. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To provide more information regarding these mutations in enzyme catalysis and/or substrate stabilization, multiple mutagenesis replacements have been undertaken in Class A β-lactamases to residues in close proximity to the active site cavity that are most likely to be in direct contact with the substrate, allowing for modified catalytic parameters (2Matagne A. Fre're J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Matagne A. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Fre're J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 581-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 4Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In conjunction with the SDN loop (3Matagne A. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Fre're J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 581-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), the Class A conserved residue Tyr-105 delineates one of the edges of the active site cavity of TEM-1 as a result of the position of its side chain near the thiazolidine ring of penicillin substrates and the dihydrothiazine ring of cephalosporin substrates. To date, two independent mutagenesis studies were performed to modify Tyr-105 to Phe and Cys on the Class A β-lactamases of Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus cereus, respectively (15Escobar W.A. Miller J. Fink A.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Di Gleria K. Halliwell C.M. Jacob C. Hill H.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The B. licheniformis Y105F mutant displayed a 52% catalytic efficiency toward benzylpenicillin compared with its corresponding wild-type enzyme. Based on these results, the Y105F mutation rules out a critical role of the hydroxyl group of the wild-type Tyr residue toward enzyme activity or stability. Moreover, the B. cereus Y105C mutant displayed native-like catalytic activity under standard nitrocefin assay conditions, demonstrating that the aromatic moiety at this position is not essential for enzyme activity or stability. On the other hand, the location and the strong conservation of aromatic character of this residue among Class A β-lactamases suggest that residue 105 may play a role in substrate recognition and/or stabilization. This hypothesis is based on crystallographic data of many Class A enzymes showing that the Tyr-105 side chain is significantly displaced upon binding of substrates or mechanism-based inhibitors as a result of a flipping motion (7Chen C.C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8434-8444Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggestive of its active participation in substrate and inhibitor positioning at the active site. As a result of this characteristic, residue 105 has been considered a determinant of susceptibility to mechanism-based inhibitors (23Page M.G.F. Drug Resist. Updat. 2000; 3: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, apart from the Y105F and Y105C mutations (15Escobar W.A. Miller J. Fink A.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Di Gleria K. Halliwell C.M. Jacob C. Hill H.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), no further site-directed mutagenesis studies have been undertaken specifically at this critical active site position. Huang et al. (24Huang W.Z. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) previously reported a three-codon-based combinatorial mutagenesis for the entire gene of TEM-1 but conducted no detailed analysis of residue 105 with respect to substrate recognition. Nevertheless, their results suggest that only the Y105H mutant is able to confer wild-type activity for ampicillin upon selecting for survival in the presence of 1 mg/ml antibiotic. However, these Y105X mutations were performed only with other simultaneous mutations at positions 103 and 104. Although the high activities observed with the Y105F and Y105C mutants suggest that hydrophobicity may be a determining factor at this active-site position, the effects of variables such as side-chain volume, polarity, and flexibility at this position have not been specifically addressed. Thus, the importance of sequence conservation at position 105 is unclear, and the role of residue 105 has yet to be elucidated in detail with respect to enzyme stability and substrate stabilization and discrimination for Class A β-lactamases. Consequently, to clarify the importance of residue 105 in TEM-1 β-lactamase as well as its potential role in other Class A β-lactamases, we performed saturation mutagenesis at position 105 on TEM-1. In vivo antibiotic susceptibility tests and in vitro kinetic studies were carried out using penicillin as well as first- and third-generation cephalosporin substrates to assess the impact of the mutations on substrate recognition and enzyme catalysis. Finally, molecular modeling studies of mutants of interest were undertaken to evaluate the structural importance of residue 105 in substrate stabilization. Our results identify residue 105 as a weak substrate determinant of TEM-1 β-lactamase. Reagents—Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas (Burlington, ON) and New England Biolabs, Ltd. (Mississauga, ON). Ampicillin was obtained from BioShop Canada, Inc. (Burlington, ON), and benzylpenicillin, cephalothin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, and Fast-Flow DEAE-Sepharose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Nitrocefin was purchased from Calbiochem. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli XL1-Blue (supE44, hsdR17, recA1, endA1, gyrA46, thi, relA1, lac F′ [proAB+, lacIq, lacZΔM15, Tn10(tetr)]) was used for the propagation and expression of all plasmids. Plasmid pQE32Chl in which the blaTEM-1 gene of pQE32 (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) was replaced by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was a generous gift from François-Xavier Campbell-Valois and Stephen W. Michnick (Département de Biochimie, Université de Montréal, QC) and was used for protein expression. It was maintained using 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Chl). 1The abbreviations used are: Chl, chloramphenicol; AMP, ampicillin; BZ, benzylpenicillin; CF, cephalothin; CZ, cefazolin; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration. Plasmid pBR322, which contains the wild-type blaTEM-1 gene (without the V84I and A184V mutations) was kindly provided by Luis A. Rokeach (Département de Biochimie, Université de Montréal, QC). Oligonucleotides and Saturation Mutagenesis—Oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis were synthesized by Alpha DNA (Montréal, QC) and Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Oligonucleotide primers used for DNA sequencing were synthesized by Li-Cor Biotechnology (Lincoln, NB). The Y105X mutants of TEM-1 were constructed using the site overlap extension mutagenesis method (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The 861-bp blaTEM-1 gene was PCR-amplified from plasmid pBR322 using the terminal oligonucleotides BamHITEMF (5′-CACACAGGATCCACATGAGTATTCAACATTTCCGT-3′) and TEMHindIIIR (5′-ACACACAAGCTTTTACCAATGCTTAATCAGTGA-3′) containing the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The 19-amino acid possibilities at codon 105 were introduced by a set of three complementary pairs of degenerate oligonucleotides (only the coding strands are shown): TEM105NTSF (5′-ATGACTTGGTTGAGNTSTCACCAGTCACAG-3′), TEM105NGSF (5′-ATGACTTGGTTGAGNGSTCACCAGTCACAG-3′), and VMS105F (5′-ATGACTTGGTTGAGVMSTCACCAGTCACAG-3′). The use of three separate degenerate oligonucleotides encoding the possibilities NTS, NGS, and VMS instead of a single NNS codon was justified by the elimination of the wild-type tyrosine residue as well as the three stop codons. The recombinant TEM genes were digested with BamHI/HindIII and cloned into BamHI/HindIII-digested and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-treated pQE32Chl before electroporation into E. coli XL1-Blue cells. Colonies were individually picked after selection on a Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 12.5 μg/ml Chl, and the sequence of each mutant was confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method with the Thermo Sequenase Cycle Sequencing kit (Upstate Biotechnology Corp., Cleveland, OH) using a dye-labeled primer and a Li-Cor automated sequencer (Lincoln, NB). Expression and Purification of Mutant β-Lactamases—An overnight culture of each XL1-Blue/pQE32Chl-TEM(Y105X) clone was used to inoculate 50 ml of LB that was grown with agitation at 37 °C until A600 nm = 0.6. After the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cultures were propagated for an additional 3 h. After induction, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (30 min, 3000 × g, 4 °C), resuspended in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.0, and separated in 1-ml aliquots. A gentle lysis of the outer membrane of E. coli was performed by 3–4 1.5-min freeze-thaw cycles using a dryice/ethanol and a 37 °C water bath followed by a centrifugation (15 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C) to collect the supernatant. Purification of TEM(Y105X) mutants of interest was performed according to the following single-step anion-exchange chromatography procedure. All steps were undertaken at 4 °C with a flow rate of 1 ml/min on a System Gold high performance liquid chromatography apparatus (Beckman Coulter Canada, Inc., Mississauga, ON). Supernatant (10 ml) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (2 × 25 cm) followed by a wash of 2.5 column volumes with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, buffer. Mutant enzymes were eluted with a linear gradient of 10–150 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, buffer (1.5 column volume), and a subsequent wash with the same buffer was finally performed (2.5 column volumes). Fractions containing β-lactamase activity were identified by a qualitative nitrocefin hydrolysis test and pooled for subsequent analysis. Aliquots of each clone were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel, and the purity was estimated in all cases to be between 80 and 90% using the public domain image analysis software Scion Image (National Institutes of Health, rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). The column was regenerated by applying 5 volumes of 8 m urea followed by 5 volumes of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, buffer between each purification. No significant β-lactamase activity carryover was detected by nitrocefin assay upon running a mock purification (cells expressing no TEM-1 β-lactamase) following a purification of the native TEM-1. Antibiotic Susceptibility—Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilutions according to Cantu et al. (26Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22538-22545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The ranges of antibiotic concentrations tested were as follows (by stepwise 2-fold increases): 125–4000 μg/ml for benzylpenicillin and ampicillin, 4–500 μg/ml for cephalothin, 1–125 μg/ml for cefazolin, and 4–500 ng/ml for cefotaxime. Each MIC determination was performed at least in triplicate in independent experiments. Enzyme Kinetics—The kinetic constants Km and kcat for benzylpenicillin and cephalothin were determined at room temperature in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for the mutants presented in Table III. The following extinction coefficients (27Bouthors A.T. Dagoneau-Blanchard N. Naas T. Nordmann P. Jarlier V. Sougakoff W. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and concentration ranges were used: Δϵ232 nm = 1100 m-1 cm-1 for benzylpenicillin (50–200 μm) and Δϵ262 nm = 7960 m-1 cm-1 for cephalothin (30–300 μm). Substrate hydrolysis was monitored according to initial steady-state velocities for a minimum of six substrate concentrations generally flanking the Km values (when the molar extinction coefficients and the Km value allowed it) using a Cary 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian Canada, Inc., Montréal, QC). For each assay the concentration of enzyme was kept at least 500 times lower than substrate for benzylpenicillin (BZ) and was generally 50 times lower for cephalothin (CF). The kinetic parameters were determined from the rates of hydrolysis calculated from the initial linear portion of the curve and fitted to a Lineweaver-Burk (1/[S] versus 1/[V]) and a Hanes ([S] versus [S]/V) plot. In most cases initial rates were also analyzed with the software Graphpad Prism (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) by a non-linear regression curve corresponding to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The kcat parameter was determined using the equation kcat = Vmax/[E], where the concentration of enzyme was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) taking into account its purity, estimated as described above.Table IIIKinetic parameters for wild-type TEM-1 β-lactamase and Y105X mutant derivativesSubstrateTEM-1 variantkcatkcat relative to wild typeKmKm relative to wild typekcat/Kmkcat/Km relative to wild types-1μmm-1 s-1BZWild type1240 ± 1251.0043 ± 91.002.9 × 1071.00Y105D255 ± 200.21369 ± 238.586.9 × 1050.02Y105G1203 ± 3500.97152 ± 613.537.9 × 1060.27Y105N1616 ± 3391.30276 ± 846.425.9 × 1060.20Y105R525 ± 700.42156 ± 383.623.4 × 1060.12Y105W900 ± 780.7323 ± 90.533.9 × 1071.34CFWild type105 ± 111.00177 ± 271.005.9 × 1051.00Y105D51 ± 110.492860 ± 54016.21.8 × 1040.03Y105G45 ± 180.431630 ± 7509.212.8 × 1040.05Y105N61 ± 170.58303 ± 971.712.0 × 1050.34Y105R90 ± 280.86546 ± 343.081.6 × 1050.27Y105W65 ± 80.6274 ± 220.428.8 × 1051.49 Open table in a new tab Computer Modeling—All computations were performed with the InsightII package, version 2000 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The BIOPOLYMER module was used to modify molecular structures, and all energy minimizations and molecular dynamics calculations were performed with the DISCOVER module using the consistent valence force field. The dynamic trajectories were analyzed using the DECIPHER module. We performed the simulations with the coordinates of an acyl-enzyme intermediate of TEM-1 complexed with benzylpenicillin (BZ), and we created an acyl-enzyme model of TEM-1 complexed with CF to compare the behavior of this substrate with that observed for BZ over the course of a 200-ps dynamics. We also conducted molecular dynamics studies using the coordinates of an apoenzyme structure of TEM-1 with residue 105 mutated, to assess conformation before substrate binding. Comparison of these systems (BZ acyl-enzyme, CF acylenzyme, and apoenzyme) allowed for the evaluation of the conformation of residue 105 before and after substrate recognition. The 1.8-Å crystallographic structure of the E. coli TEM-1 β-lactamase (Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory, code 1BTL) (28Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.M. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) was used for the starting coordinates for apoenzyme calculations, and the 1.7-Å crystallographic structure of a E166N deacylation-defective mutant of the same enzyme (PDB code 1FQG) (8Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) was used for the starting coordinates for calculations involving benzylpenicillin-bound enzyme. The crystallographic water molecules of both enzymes were conserved. The active site SO4 molecule was deleted from 1BTL, and the E166N mutation of 1FQG was reverted to wild type. Hydrogen atoms were added at the normal ionization state of the amino acids at pH 7.0. For 1FQG, the atomic potentials of the BZ substrate were fixed according to the consistent valence force field atom types recommended by the manufacturer. These coordinates served as the starting points for all the subsequent calculations in presence (1FQG) or absence (1BTL) of BZ. The Y105G, Y105L, Y105N, Y105Q, Y105R, and Y105W mutations were introduced. Before minimization, the tryptophan side chain was repositioned according to the crystal structure of the structurally homologous Class A PER-1 β-lactamase (PDB code 1E25) (9Tranier S. Bouthors A.T. Maveyraud L. Guillet V. Sougakoff W. Samama J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28075-28082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Residues contained in a simulation area within 15 Å from any atom of BZ (1FQG) or residue 105 (1BTL) were allowed to move as well as the loop encompassing residues 96–116, with the remainder of the protein being fixed. A layer of 5 Å of explicit water was added to the surface of this assembly, and a nonbonded cutoff of 20 Å was fixed to reduce the time of calculation. Each structure was energy-minimized by applying 100 steps of steepest descents followed by a conjugate gradient minimization until convergence of 0.001 kcal mol-1 Å-1. A short molecular dynamics simulation was performed starting from the energy-minimized structures. Accordingly, the molecular system was allowed to equilibrate at 310 K for 100 fs followed by the actual simulation to explore conformational space for 200 ps at the same temperature (time step = 1 fs). Snapshots were taken each picosecond, generating 201 different conformers. At this point the trajectories obtained for each mutant were analyzed. To create the acyl-enzyme intermediate models of TEM-1 with cephalothin (TEM-CF and Y105G-CF), the atomic coordinates of CF were taken from the crystal structure of an acyl-enzyme intermediate of TOHO-1 β-lactamase (PDB code 1IYP) (10Shimamura T. Ibuka A. Fushinobu S. Wakagi T. Ishiguro M. Ishii Y. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46601-46608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and fitted to the 1.8-Å crystallographic structure of the E. coli TEM-1 β-lactamase (PDB code 1BTL). The active site SO4 molecule was deleted from 1BTL, and the CF substrate was positioned according to BZ in 1FQG by applying torsions to the Cβ-Oγ bond of Ser-70. Hydrogen atoms were adjusted to pH 7, and the atomic potentials of CF were adjusted as described herein. An energy minimization was performed on this structure by applying 100 steps of steepest descents followed by a conjugate gradient minimization until convergence of 0.001 kcal mol-1Å-1. This structure served as the starting coordinate for all subsequent steps of minimization and dynamics studies, which were performed as described above. Antibiotic Susceptibility—We mutated position 105 (Tyr) of TEM-1 β-lactamase to the 19 other possibilities and confirmed through DNA sequencing of the entire gene that no secondary mutations had occurred. To assess the effect of the Y105X replacements on the capacity of TEM-1 to hydrolyze penicillin-type and cephalosporin antibiotics, MICs were calculated for E. coli XL1-Blue cells alone or expressing TEM-1 mutants. The antibiotics used are presented in Fig. 1. Table I presents MIC values determined for all mutants toward two classical penicillin-type substrates, BZ and ampicillin (AMP) as well as two typical first-generation cephalosporins, cephalothin (CF) and cefazolin (CZ). Thus, in vivo cell survival at higher antibiotic concentrations reflects a higher rate of hydrolysis by the enzyme. Because they are performed in vivo, MIC values serve as points of comparison rather than precise values and do not directly correlate with the Km or kcat parameters of each mutant enzyme. They nevertheless offer a rapid, qualitative assessment of the efficiency of mutants and allow for the identification of mutants deemed to be the most interesting with respect to detailed kinetic analysis.Table IMICs of E. coli XL1-Blue cells expressing TEM-1 β-lactamase with Tyr-105 replacements Open table in a new tab As seen in Table I, the range of resistance is higher for the penicillin substrates (500–4000 μg/ml for BZ and 500–7500 μg/ml for AMP) than for the cephalosporin substrates (16–125 μg/ml for CF and 4–250 μg/ml for CZ). This result was expected since Class A β-lactamases hydrolyze penicillins much more efficiently than cephalosporins, the latter having been historically developed to counteract the appearance of natural resistance to penicillins (29Bush K. Mobashery S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 456: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Page M.I. Adv. Phys. Org. Chem. 1987; 23: 165-270Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the 20 mutants allow for a comparable breadth of resistance with respect to these four substrates. Thus, the ratio between the least and the most active mutants for BZ hydrolysis is approximately one order of magnitude (500 μg/ml relative to 4000 μg/ml), similar to that observed for CF hydrolysis (16 μg/ml relative to 125 μg/ml). AMP and CZ allow for slightly broader ranges but remain in the same range of resistance as BZ and CF, respectively. This breadth of resistance illustrates that position 105 replacements can alter enzyme efficiency up to a factor of 10-fold. Nonetheless, this relatively weak effect confirms previous observations suggesting that position 105 cannot be considered essential for enzyme catalysis in Class A β-lactamases (15Escobar W.A. Miller J. Fink A.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 31Wolozin B.L. Myerowitz R. Pratt R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 701: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To understand the source of the effect, we examined the following hypotheses; (a) disparity in enzyme solubility conferred by the Y105X replacements, (b) changes in periplasmic localization efficiency of some Y105X mutants, (c) an active site cavity disruption modifying substrate recognition or catalytic turnover. We verified that the mutations at position 105 have little effe"

This locus is syntenic to a region of human chromosome 4q13.3 containing the human orthologues of four of the mouse DESC1-like genes. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that all seven DESC1-like genes encode functional proteases. Direct cDNA cloning showed that mouse DESC1 encodes a multidomain serine protease with an N-terminal signal anchor, a SEA (sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, and agrin) domain, and a C-terminal serine protease domain. The mouse DESC1 mRNA was present in epidermal, oral, and male reproductive tissues and directed the translation of a membrane-associated 60-kDa N-glycosylated protein with type II topology. Mouse DESC1 was synthesized in insect cells as a zymogen that could be activated by exposure to trypsin. The purified activated DESC1 hydrolyzed synthetic peptide substrates, showing a preference for Arg in the P1 position. DESC1 proteolytic activity was abolished by generic inhibitors of serine proteases but not by other classes of protease inhibitors. Most interestingly, DESC1 formed stable inhibitory complexes with both plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and protein C inhibitor that are expressed in the same tissues with DESC1, suggesting that type II transmembrane serine proteases may be novel targets for serpin inhibition. Together, these data show that mouse DESC1 encodes a functional cell surface serine protease that may have important functions in the epidermis, oral, and reproductive epithelium.

Pericellular proteolysis is essential to all aspects of vertebrate life, including development, tissue homeostasis, tissue remodeling, tissue repair, and reproduction, and dysregulated pericellular proteolysis is causally related to a large number of diseases in humans. Within the past century, the most extensive studies of pericellular proteolysis in health and disease focused on defining the contribution of a relatively limited number of proteases belonging to the families of plasminogen activators, matrix metalloproteinases, and cathepsins (1Werb Z.

This rapidly expanding family of serine proteases is defined by the presence of an N-terminal signal anchor and a C-terminal serine protease domain, separated by a stem region containing an array of protein domains that varies widely between individual TTSPs (24Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 857-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The exploration of the physiological function of most members of the TTSP family is in its infancy. An exception is enteropeptidase, whose function as an initiator of a zymogen cascade leading to digestive enzyme activation is well established (25Rutgeerts L. Eggermont E. Tijdschr.

Collectively, these studies have provided strong evidence that the TTSP family contributes to both human health and human disease. To facilitate the functional analysis of the TTSP complement of genes in mice, we have identified and characterized the murine orthologue of human DESC1, a putative TTSP gene that was previously identified as an mRNA transcript expressed in certain normal human tissues but not in their corresponding malignancies (19Lang J.C. Schuller D.E. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We show that mouse DESC1 encodes a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, which displays both caseinolytic and gelatinolytic activities, and is a functional serine protease with an Arg-subsite preference. Most interestingly, DESC1 forms inhibitory complexes with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and protein C inhibitor (PCI or PAI-3), indicating that the TTSP family of proteases may be targets for serine protease inhibitor (serpin) inhibition, and suggesting that the two serpins interact with DESC1 to regulate the function of the protease in tissues such as epidermis, salivary gland, and epididymis. Furthermore, we show that the DESC1 gene is located in a cluster containing seven highly homologous genes within a short 0.5-Mb region of mouse chromosome 5E1 with a corresponding cluster of five human DESC1-like genes on human chromosome 4q13.3. All 12 candidate genes are predicted to encode functional serine proteases, thus further expanding the repertoire of functional TTSPs in the mouse. Bioinformatic Analysis of the Mouse Chromosome 5E1 TTSP Cluster—BLAST analysis with the published human DESC1 cDNA sequence was performed by using the NCBI and Celera Discovery System mouse genome data bases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; www.celera.com; and www.genome.ecsc.edu) and the NCBI mouse EST data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/Blast.cgi) for the mouse orthologue/homologues of DESC1 using the published human DESC1 cDNA sequence (19Lang J.C. Schuller D.E. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The rat orthologue of mouse DESC1 was identified by screening the NCBI EST data base with the mouse cDNA sequence. Additional mouse DESC1 homologues were identified by using the predicted mouse DESC1 cDNA as in silico probe to scan the mouse chromosome 5E1 region using the Celera Discovery System data base. The exon-intron boundaries of DESC1-like candidate genes were identified using FuzzyFinder (www.genome.nci.nih.gov/tools). Signal anchor predictions were done using SignalP version 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk); potential protein coding regions were identified with SMART (www.smart.ox.ac.uk), and potential post-translational modifications were determined using NetPhos2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk) and NetNGlyc1.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk). Alignment of multiple predicted DESC1-like protein sequences was done by using ClustalW. cDNA Cloning of Mouse DESC1—A mouse skin cDNA library was constructed using the SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit from Clontech. Gene-specific primers containing SalI linkers were designed to the 5′ end (5′-AGTCGTCGACATGAACACACTCAGTCACGGACC-3′) and the 3′ end (5′-ATCAGTCGACGATACCAGTGTTGGAAGCAATCCAGTG-3′) of the predicted mouse DESC1 cDNA. PCR amplification was performed with Platinum High Fidelity Supermix (Invitrogen) using a GeneAmp 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using 32 cycles of denaturing (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s), and extension (69 °C, 45 s), followed by a 3-min final extension at 69 °C. The amplified product was cloned into pBSII-SK- (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the identity and sequence integrity of the DESC1 cDNA were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using multiple overlapping internal primers. Analysis of DESC1 mRNA Expression in the Mouse—Primary mouse keratinocytes and fibroblasts were isolated from the epidermis of 1-day-old mice exactly as described (45Netzel-Arnett S. Mitola D.J. Yamada S.S. Chrysovergis K. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Bugge T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45154-45161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Total RNA from keratinocytes cultured for 3 days, fibroblasts, and 1-day-old mouse skin were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation. Total RNA from mouse liver, brain, thymus, heart, lung, spleen, testicles, ovaries, and kidneys was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). First strand synthesis was carried out with 1 μg of total RNA using RETROscript (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed as described above using 30 cycles of denaturing (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s), and extension (69 °C, 30 s), followed by a 3-min final extension cycle at 69 °C. Specific primers (5′-CCCAATGTTGATCCTGAGTCAG-3′ and 5′-AGCAGCAGTCACAAGCCATGTG-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 511–532 and 729–750 of the mouse DESC1 cDNA sequence, or the mouse GAPDH-specific primers (5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′) followed the same PCR parameters except the number of cycles was reduced to 25. PCR amplification products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide for UV visualization. For cDNA array screening, the full-length mouse DESC1 cDNAs or a mouse ubiquitin control cDNA probe was labeled with 32P using Ready-to-Go random prime DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). A mouse RNA master blot from Clontech was prehybridized for 1 h with ExpressHyb (Clontech) containing 150 μg/ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA. After prehybridization, 1.5 × 106 cpm of labeled probe was added, and the blot was hybridized overnight at 65 °C. The blot was washed extensively with 2× SSC containing 0.5% SDS and then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences) for visualization. Quantitation of the hybridization signal was performed with a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of Full-length Recombinant Mouse DESC1 and Western Blot Analysis—The mouse DESC1 cDNA was truncated just prior to the predicted TAA stop codon by PCR amplification as described above. The amplification product was verified by sequencing and was subcloned into the PmlI site of the mammalian expression vector pMH (Roche Applied Science) to extend the C terminus of the mouse DESC1 protein with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. Human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing sodium pyruvate and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine and were cultured in a 5% CO2-buffered tissue culture incubator. Prior to transfection, the cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated 10-cm2 tissue culture dishes and were transfected with the mouse DESC-HA expression plasmid using Polyfect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by scraping with a cell scraper in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.01% SDS, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), followed by a 10-min incubation on ice. The cell lysate was then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting protein lysate was boiled for 10 min in Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Forty μg of protein lysate was separated on pre-cast 4–12% BisTris SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), and the separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS/Tween 20 with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Primary anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Covance Laboratories, Richmond, CA) was added overnight at 4 °C at a dilution of 1:1000 in TBS/Tween 20 with 5% (w/v) dry milk, and the membrane was washed extensively with TBS/Tween 20 and incubated with a secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody. Bound antibodies were visualized by using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate tablets (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Deglycosylation of Mouse DESC1—Protein lysate (30 mg) was denatured in 1× glycoprotein-denaturing buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) containing 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol by heating to 100 °C for 10 min. Sodium citrate (pH 5.5) was then added to a final concentration of 50 mm. Endoglycosidase H (2000 units/reaction) was added, and the deglycosylation reaction was performed at 37 °C for 1.5 h prior to separation by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described above. Confocal Analysis of Mouse DESC1 Membrane Localization and Topology—HeLa cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and transfected with mDESC-HA and/or GFP expression plasmids as described above. The transfected cells were washed in PBS 36 h later, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed three times with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After washing, the slides were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance Laboratories) in PBS with 3% BSA for 1 h and washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 3% BSA. The coverslips were then incubated with AlexaFluor-546-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in PBS with 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, washed with ice-cold PBS containing 3% BSA, mounted, and analyzed by confocal microscopy with a Leica SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Bannockburn, IL). Expression of Mouse DESC1 Serine Protease Domain and Full-length Soluble Mouse DESC1—Sf9 insect cells were maintained in 420 SFM medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KA) and cultured at 27 °C. The serine protease domain (nucleotides 586–1329) of mouse DESC1 was amplified by PCR using the forward primer, 5′-CTTGCATGCGAAGTTGTGGGACACGACGGAACAAATC-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-CCTCTAGAAATACCAGTGTTGGAAGCAATCC-3′. Full-length soluble mouse DESC1 (nucleotides 184–1329) was amplified by PCR using the forward primer, 5′-ACGCGCATGCACAGATACAATCACAGGAGAACCTACAATTAC-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-CCTCTAGAAATACCAGTGTTGGAAGCAATCC-3′. The amplification products were verified by DNA sequence analysis and were inserted in-frame between the SphI and XbaI sites of the insect cell expression vector pMIB/V5-His (Invitrogen). The resulting expression plasmids were transfected into Sf9 insect cells using Cellfectin (Invitrogen), and several polyclonal cell lines were isolated by selection with blasticidin S as recommended by the manufacturer. Conditioned medium was collected from pools of stably transfected Sf9 cells for subsequent analysis. For purification of the DESC1 serine protease domain, phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and NaCl were added to the conditioned medium to a final concentration of 20 mm and 0.5 m, respectively. The solution was applied to a cobalt-charged HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) using the AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system. Chelated proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 20–200 mm imidazole in 20 mm phosphate buffer, 0.5 m NaCl, and the purified mouse DESC1 serine protease domain was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C until use. Zymographic Analysis of the Mouse DESC1 Serine Protease Domain—Gelatin and casein zymography was performed on 11% Tris/glycine gels containing either 0.5% gelatin or 0.1% β-casein (Sigma) as described previously (45Netzel-Arnett S. Mitola D.J. Yamada S.S. Chrysovergis K. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Bugge T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45154-45161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The gels were developed overnight in 0.1 m glycine, pH 8.0, at 37 °C, stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue, and destained in a 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid solution to visualize the zones of substrate lysis. Proteolytic Activation of the Mouse DESC1 Zymogen—Purified mouse DESC1 serine protease domain or Sf9-conditioned medium containing either the mouse DESC1 serine protease domain or full-length soluble mouse DESC1 was incubated with trypsin-agarose beads (Sigma T-1763) for 10 min at 25 °C. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the activated DESC1 was re-purified by cobalt-charged HiTrap chelating chromatography as above. Chromogenic Peptide Hydrolysis Assay—The peptides Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Lys-pNA, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Arg-pNA, Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA, and benzyloxycarbonyl fluoride-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA were purchased from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). AEBSF, aprotinin, leupeptin, E64, egg white trypsin inhibitor (ovomucoid), and l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant DESC1 (10 nm) or trypsin (1 nm) were incubated with 100 μm chromogenic peptide substrate in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.01% BSA, and 0.02% NaN3 buffer at 35 °C over a 20-min period. Changes in absorbance at 405 nm were monitored over time on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences HTS 7000 BioAssay Reader. As indicated, AEBSF was added to 0.5 mm final concentration, aprotinin to 2 μm, leupeptin to 50 μm, E64 to 35 μm, egg white trypsin inhibitor to 50 nm, and EDTA to 2.5 mm. Assays were performed in triplicate. Initial rates were measured for each enzyme and normalized to that obtained for Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Arg-pNA. Mouse DESC1-Inhibitor Complex Formation—Partially purified mouse DESC1 serine protease domain (20 nm) or conditioned medium containing mouse DESC1 serine protease domain or full-length soluble mouse DESC1 was incubated for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 buffer at room temperature with 150 nm purified human α2-macroglogulin or 100 nm recombinant purified serpins. Where indicated, some experiments included 20 μg/ml heparin (Sigma). Purified serpins are as follows: PAI-1 (Molecular Innovations, Southfield, MI); PCI (human wild type recombinant PCI was expressed in Escherichia coli, strain BL21(DE3)pLysS, using the Qiagen pET15b expression vector (with an N-terminal polyhistidine sequence), and purified to homogeneity by Ni2+-chelate chromatography); 2S.

Identification of the Mouse DESC1 Gene within a Gene Cluster That Encodes Seven DESC1-like TTSPs—We searched for a mouse orthologue and homologues of the human DESC1 gene using the Celera and NCBI genome data bases, and we identified a candidate orthologue that was located in a syntenic region of mouse chromosome 5E1 (hereafter, mouse DESC1) and several homologues (see below). Inspection of the predicted mRNA sequence of mouse DESC1 revealed a 1329-base long open reading frame that contained an in-frame initiation codon and termination codon (Fig. 1A). A con"
https://openalex.org/W2034758456,"β-Catenin is a potent oncogenic protein whose cytoplasmic accumulation is a frequent event in cancer cells. The level of β-catenin is regulated by two mechanisms: the adenomatous polyposis coli/Axin/glycogen synthase kinase 3β-dependent degradation pathway and the Siah-1/Siah interacting protein/Ebi-mediated degradation pathway. In this study, we have investigated the functional significance of p53-inducible human Siah-family protein expression in the regulation of β-catenin activity. We show here by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction that two mRNA transcripts, designated human Siah-1 and Siah-1L, are generated from the human Siah-1 locus. Interestingly, the expression of Siah-1L was upregulated by p53, whereas human Siah-1 expression was constant. Furthermore, introduction of exogenous Siah-1L protein downregulated β-catenin protein and promoted apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs in cancer cells that lack endogenous p53. Thus, Siah-1L represents a new member of the human Siah family that is induced in response to p53 and plays an important role in the regulation of β-catenin activity in tumor cells. These findings also suggest new strategies for restoring tumor suppressive pathways lost in cancer cells that have suffered p53 inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2112707750,"The E2F family of transcription factors regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, DNA synthesis, repair, and recombination, and a variety of other cellular processes. Although E2F proteins are often redundant in function, specificity of binding and activity can occur. For example, E2F1, but not other E2F family members, was shown previously to bind the murine carboxylesterase promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation studies (Wells, J., Graveel, C. R., Bartley, S. M., Madore, S. J., and Farnham, P. J. (2002) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.</i> 99, 3890–3895). This promoter region lacks a consensus E2F binding site, suggesting that E2F1 may be recruited to the DNA in a unique fashion. To further investigate this E2F1-specific binding, we have employed a ""transient chromatin immunoprecipitation"" approach. Using various deletions and mutations of the promoter region, we localized the E2F1-specific binding site and demonstrated that it was required for E2F1-mediated transcription of the carboxylesterase promoter. The identified site was similar to the 8-bp consensus E2F site but differed from the consensus at a crucial position. To address whether E2F1 directly bound to this non-consensus site, we demonstrated that the DNA binding domain of E2F1 is necessary for E2F1-mediated activation of the carboxylesterase promoter. Interestingly, a ""UP"" mutation of the site, making it more similar to the consensus element, did not improve the ability of E2F1 to bind the promoter. Rather, E2F1 could no longer bind to the carboxylesterase promoter that contained the consensus E2F site. We propose a model in which E2F1-specific regulation of the carboxylesterase promoter requires both E2F1/DNA interactions and protein-protein interaction between E2F1 and a factor that binds adjacent to the non-consensus site."
https://openalex.org/W2018110741,"Cyclin D3 plays a critical role in maturation of precursor T cells and their levels are tightly regulated during this process. Alteration of cyclin D3 levels has been proposed to be important in the development of different human cancers, including malignancies of the lymphoid system. Thus, we have analysed the mechanisms involved in the regulation of cyclin D3 levels. Our results indicate that cyclin D3 is degraded via proteasome and that Thr-283 is essential for its degradation. Wild-type cyclin D3 but not the Thr-283A mutant accumulated ubiquitylated forms after treatment with proteasome inhibitors. We also observed that different type of stresses promote the Thr-283-dependent in vivo degradation of cyclin D3. The analysis of the kinases involved in Thr-283 phosphorylation indicates that all the members of the p38SAPK family of serine–threonine kinases are able to phosphorylate cyclin D3 at this specific site. Moreover, we found that the overexpression of p38αSAPK2 induce the decrease of cyclin D3 in vivo. These results indicate that p38SAPK might be involved in the regulation of cyclin D3 levels and suggest that this mechanism is involved in the maturation of precursor T-cells. Alterations of this mechanism might be important for oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2064335424,"Treatment of various types of cells with the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channel opener, diazoxide, preconditions cells to subsequent injuries and inhibits apoptosis. The mechanism of such preconditioning is not well understood. We have studied the effect of diazoxide pretreatment on mitochondrial morphology and function in HL60 cells and on susceptibility of these cells to apoptosis. We have found that diazoxide pretreatment inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Diazoxide induced moderate mitochondrial swelling and increase in the cytosolic fraction of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins including cytochrome c without any significant effect on the oxidative phosphorylation function or membrane potential. Possibly as an adaptive response, total protein and mRNA levels of cytochrome c and of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-xl, increased. These effects coincided with activation of the transcription factors cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and NFκB. The gene encoding cytochrome c carries the cAMP-response element (CRE), and the gene encoding Bcl-xl carries both the CRE and NFκB response elements. The inability of etoposide to trigger apoptosis in preconditioned cells was most likely because of prosurvival signaling by CREB and NFκB, which included up-regulation of cytochrome c and Bcl-xl. All described effects were reversed by a specific mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channel inhibitor, 5-hydroxydecanoate, proving the specificity of the action of diazoxide. Preconditioning was also reversed by a specific NFκB inhibitor, SN50, proving the importance of this transcription factor for the phenomenon of preconditioning. CREB and NFκB were activated most likely in response to an observed elevation in cytosolic calcium following diazoxide treatment. We, therefore, conclude that diazoxide-mediated preconditioning against apoptosis involves activation of the pro-survival transcription factors CREB and NFκB.

MitoK-ATP channels can be selectively opened using low (less than 100 μm) doses of diazoxide (3Liu D. Lu C. Wan R. Auyeung W.W. Mattson M.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although the effect of diazoxide on isolated mitochondria has been thoroughly studied (8Kowaltowski A. Seetharaman S. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H649-H657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an understanding of how diazoxide treatment leads to preconditioning in living cells is still lacking. Therefore, the goal of our study was to explore the morphological and biochemical changes induced by diazoxide in living cells and find out how such changes might lead to enhanced pro-survival signaling during preconditioning. To pursue this goal, we used a model system, which included diazoxide pretreatment in HL60 cells and subsequent induction of apoptosis with the cytotoxic drug etoposide. We have found that diazoxide pretreatment inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis and apoptosis-related mitochondrial dysfunction. Diazoxide treatment induced changes in mitochondrial morphology (such as moderate swelling) and biochemistry (such as increased cytosolic fractions of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins including cytochrome c followed by overexpression of cytochrome c and of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-xl).

Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 95: 1132-1136Crossref Scopus (4289) Google Scholar, 14Eliseev R.A. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Mitochondrion. 2002; 1: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to trigger apoptosis in preconditioned cells was likely because of pro-survival signaling by CREB and NFκB, which included up-regulation of Bcl-xl, replenishment of the mitochondrial pool of cytochrome c, and possibly other phenomena. All of the described effects were reversed by the specific mitoK-ATP channel inhibitor, 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) (3Liu D. Lu C. Wan R. Auyeung W.W. Mattson M.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), proving the specificity of the action of diazoxide. Preconditioning was also reversed by the specific NFκB inhibitor peptide, SN50 (15Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), implicating the importance of this transcription factor for the phenomenon of preconditioning. CREB and NFκB were likely activated in response to an elevation in cytosolic calcium (16Hongpaisan J. Winters C.A. Andrews S.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Pahl H.L. Sester M. Burgert H.G. Baeuerle P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) observed following diazoxide treatment. We, therefore, conclude that diazoxide treatment induces mitochondrial-nuclear communication and stimulates cell defenses against apoptosis via activation of the pro-survival transcription factors CREB and NFκB. Reagents—Most chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Cell Culture and Treatment—HL60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with a 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin mixture (all media components were from Invitrogen) to the density of 1 × 106/ml. Cells were treated with either 30 μm diazoxide (Dz) in the absence or presence of 600 μm 5-hydroxydecanoate or with Me2SO as a vehicle control. After 1 h, some aliquots of cells were washed with PBS and then treated with 50 μm etoposide. Some cells were treated with diazoxide in the presence of 50 μm SN50 or 10 μm H89 (both from Calbiochem). To chelate cytosolic calcium, some cells were loaded with 10 μm BAPTA-AM (TefLabs) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed in PBS, and then treated with Dz. Cell Fractions and Whole Cell Lysates—Nuclear fractions were prepared using the NE-PER nuclear extraction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cytosolic fractions were prepared without the cell homogenization step to avoid possible homogenization-related release of mitochondrial proteins because of membrane fragility. Instead cells were incubated in permeabilization buffer (195 mm mannitol, 65 mm sucrose, 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.05 mm EGTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% digitonin) for 5 min on ice and spun down (Hermle microtube rotor, 13,000 rpm, 5 min, +4 °C). The low ionic strength of the permeabilization buffer prevented any additional release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins as was tested experimentally. 2R. A. Eliseev and T. E. Gunter, unpublished data. Cell lysates were prepared by washing cells in PBS at room temperature, resuspending them in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) at 10 × 106 cells/ml on ice for 15 min, and sonicating them for 30 s on ice. Cell fractions and lysates were stored at –20 °C until needed. Detection of Apoptosis—Apoptotic cells were detected by staining nuclei with 1 μm Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Stained nuclei were visualized using a fluorescence microscope. The number of condensed, i.e. apoptotic nuclei versus uniformly stained, i.e. normal nuclei was counted. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured in digitonin-permeabilized cells (18Eliseev R.A. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using the TPP+ uptake method as described in detail in Ref. 19Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar. Oxygen Consumption—Oxygen consumption was assayed using a Clark-type oxygen sensor (20Jensen B.D. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in a sealed thermostated chamber as described previously (21Eliseev R.A. Salter J.D. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml were loaded into the chamber at +37 °C. After equilibration, the chamber was sealed, and a reading was taken for 10 min, after which 1% dithionite was added to calibrate the oxygen sensor. Electron Microscopy—Ten million cells per sample were washed in PBS, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in Pi buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4) overnight at +4 °C, washed in Pi buffer, and stained with 1% OsO4 in Pi buffer for 30 min. After three washes in Pi buffer, cells were resuspended in 4% melted agarose and spun down (bucket centrifuge, 3500 rpm, 1 min). Agarose-trapped cell pellets were solidified for 1 h at +4 °C, cut into 1-mm3 pieces, dehydrated sequentially with 25, 50, 75, 90, and 100% ethanol (20 min each), and embedded in Spurr's resin. Cryothin slices were then prepared and visualized using a Hitachi H-7100 transmission electron microscope. Adenylate Kinase Activity—Adenylate kinase in cytosolic fractions was determined enzymatically as described previously (22O'Gorman E. Beutner G. Willimann T. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To measure adenylate kinase, 0.1 ml of the cytosolic fraction was added to 0.9 ml of a reaction mixture containing 150 mm KCl, 100 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 16 mm MgSO4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADH, 1.2 mm ATP, 0.39 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 7 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 20 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. After the signal stabilized, 1.4 mm AMP was added. The enzyme-dependent rate of NADH oxidation (VNADH) in a coupled reaction was measured using a Hitachi spectrofluorimeter. Excitation was at 340 nm, and emission was measured at 450 nm. The enzyme concentration was then calculated using standard VNADHversus [adenylate kinase] calibration curve. Western Blotting—Protein samples (30 μg of total protein) were electrophoresed against protein ladder standards and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h, membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted 1:2000. Antibodies used were anti-cytochrome c (Pharmingen), anti-holocytochrome c (Trevigen), anti-Bcl-xl (Oncogene), anti-p65/RelA (Santa Cruz), and anti-pCREB (Upstate Biotechnology). Membranes were then washed and incubated for 1 h with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:50,000. After washing, membranes were developed using chemiluminescent substrate West-Pico (Pierce), photographed, scanned, and analyzed using Adobe PhotoShop software. To verify equal loading, membranes were either reversibly stained with Ponceau S before blocking or stripped after the development and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody (ICN). Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR—At the indicated times, 2 × 106 cells of each experimental group were taken, and total cellular RNA was prepared using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of prepared RNA was assayed by UV absorption at 260 nm. Fifty ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. One μl of the cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR using the following sets of primers: cytochrome c (5′-GGG TGA TGT TGA GAA AGG CAA GAA G-3′ and 5′-CAA AGA TCA TTT TTG TTC CAG GGA TGT AC-3′), Bcl-xl (5′-GAG ACC CCC AGT GCC ATC AAT G-3′ and 5′-CCG GAA GAG TTC ATT CAC TAC CTG TTC-3′), and actin (5′-GGA CGA CGC CCC TGG AAC CAT GTT TCC CTC C-3′ and 5′-GCT TGT TGT AGG GTG TGG TGC CAG ATC TTC TCC ATG CC-3′). Real-time PCR was performed as described previously (23Wittwer C.T. Herrmann M.G. Moss A.A. Rasmussen R.P. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 134-138Google Scholar) using the RotorGene real-time DNA amplification system (Corbett Research) and the double strand-specific fluorescent dye SYBR Green to monitor DNA synthesis. PCR products were subjected to a melting curve analysis, and the data were analyzed and quantified with the RotorGene analysis software. The mRNA levels of cytochrome c or Bcl-xl were normalized to mRNA levels of actin. CREB and NFκB Transcriptional Activities—Transcriptional activities of CREB and NFκB were determined using a heterologous promoter-reporter luciferase assay. To assay CREB, cells were co-transfected with the CREB firefly luciferase reporter vector pCREB-Luc (Invitrogen) and pRL-SV40. To assay NFκB, cells were co-transfected with the NFκB firefly luciferase reporter vector pNFκB-Luc (Invitrogen) and the Renilla luciferase reporter vector pRL-SV40 (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (24Andela V.B. Sheu T.J. Puzas E.J. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Rosier R.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Calcium Measurements—Free cytosolic calcium was measured in living cells with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent probe Fura-2 AM as described previously (25Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Maines M. Costa L.G. Reed D.J. Sassa S. Sipes I.G. Current Protocols in Toxicology. Wiley, NY1999: 2.5.1-2.5.53Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with 3 μm Fura-2 AM for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, and resuspended in regular media at 1 × 106/ml. After 1 h of treatment with Me2SO (Ct), Dz, or Dz + 5-HD, the cell suspension was loaded into a round, stirred 37 °C-thermostated cuvette in a Hitachi spectrofluorimeter, and Fura-2 fluorescence was measured at 505 nm (excitation was at 340 and 380 nm). The Fura-2 340/380 excitation ratio was used as a measure of a free cytosolic calcium. Pretreatment with Diazoxide Protects Cells against Apoptosis—As discussed above, earlier studies have shown that pretreatment with diazoxide often protects cells and inhibits apoptosis induced by various stimuli. To determine whether pretreatment with diazoxide preconditions cells against apoptotic stimulus in our model system, we incubated HL60 cells with 30 μm diazoxide for 1 h, washed cells, and then added the potent apoptosis inducer, etoposide, to a final concentration of 50 μm. Then, 1.5 and 3 h later, the percentage of apoptotic cells was measured by Hoechst 33342 staining. A subset of cells was co-incubated with a specific mitoK-ATP channel inhibitor, 5-HD. Fig. 1A shows that apoptosis was greatly inhibited by pretreatment with diazoxide, the effect being partially reversed by co-incubation with 5-HD. During apoptosis in the described system, mitochondrial function is progressively impaired (18Eliseev R.A. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To assess mitochondrial function in cells pretreated with diazoxide and then induced with etoposide, we measured mitochondrial membrane potential using the TPP+ uptake method (19Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) and the rate of respiration, VO2, using the oxygen electrode (20Jensen B.D. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) at the indicated time points. As shown in Fig. 1B, pretreatment with diazoxide prevented the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration and, therefore, protected mitochondrial function against subsequent apoptotic injury. This effect was again partially reversed by 5-HD. We, therefore, confirmed that treatment of HL60 cells with Dz protects them against apoptosis-related injury. Effect of Diazoxide on Mitochondrial Morphology and Function—To understand how diazoxide preconditions cells, we investigated its effect on mitochondrial morphology and function. We incubated HL60 cells with diazoxide for 1 h and prepared samples for electron microscopy as described previously (18Eliseev R.A. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2A, diazoxide treatment led to the appearance of moderately swollen mitochondria with ballooning cristae. Statistical analysis of electron micrographs (Fig. 2B) revealed that in the control almost 100% of all mitochondria have a normal conformation, whereas after 1 h of treatment with diazoxide, 40% of the mitochondria change conformation from normal to swollen. This was reversible by co-incubation of cells with 5-HD. To find out whether mitochondrial function was affected after treatment with diazoxide, we measured oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential. Diazoxide treatment led to slight stimulation of respiration but had no effect on mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 2C). This was expected because earlier studies had revealed similar results in isolated mitochondria (8Kowaltowski A. Seetharaman S. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H649-H657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, although the diazoxide treatment led to 5-HD-sensitive moderate swelling and remodeling of mitochondria, their oxidative function and membrane potential were not impaired. Treatment with Diazoxide Results in Increased Cytosolic Fractions of Mitochondrial Intermembrane Proteins—Even moderate swelling and remodeling of mitochondria may lead to rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane and release of intermembrane proteins. We, therefore, analyzed cytosolic fractions of cells treated with diazoxide for 1 h for the presence of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins cytochrome c and adenylate kinase. Cytosolic and total cytochrome c were assayed by Western blotting of either cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3A) or total lysates using antibody specific to holocytochrome c. Quantitative analysis of Western blots (Fig. 3B) revealed that on average 5% of total cytochrome c was present in the cytosol after treatment with diazoxide. This represents a very limited release, compared with the one observed during apoptosis, when at least 30% of total cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria (21Eliseev R.A. Salter J.D. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Using antibody specific to holocytochrome c prevented detection of apocytochrome c on its way to being imported into mitochondria. Cytosolic adenylate kinase, measured enzymatically as described previously (22O'Gorman E. Beutner G. Willimann T. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), also increased (Fig. 3C), showing nonspecific permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane because of moderate swelling after treatment with diazoxide. It should be noted that the observed moderate increase in cytosolic cytochrome c did not result in the induction of apoptosis for up to 6 h (data not shown). Overexpression of Mitochondrial Proteins—While analyzing cytosolic and total cytochrome c following treatment with diazoxide, we noticed a consistent increase in total cellular cytochrome c (Fig. 4, A and B). To confirm whether such an increase reflected enhanced expression, we performed a real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis (24Andela V.B. Sheu T.J. Puzas E.J. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Rosier R.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C) in addition to Western blotting and found that the expression of cytochrome c was indeed up-regulated at an mRNA level. Earlier data showed that the opening of mitoK-ATP channels might lead to altered expression of the Bcl-2 protein (3Liu D. Lu C. Wan R. Auyeung W.W. Mattson M.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We, therefore, decided to test whether the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-xl was up-regulated. We measured Bcl-xl protein level by Western blotting (Fig. 4, A and B) and Bcl-xl mRNA level by real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis (Fig. 4C), and we found that both Bcl-xl protein and Bcl-xl mRNA levels were elevated after treatment with diazoxide. These data indicate that the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-xl is up-regulated in concert with cytochrome c. Observed overexpression of cytochrome c and Bcl-xl after treatment with diazoxide was reversed by the addition of 5-HD (Fig. 4). All of these measured mitochondrial proteins are nuclear coded. Thus, diazoxide treatment induces mitochondrialnuclear and nuclear-mitochondrial communication resulting in up-regulation of expression of mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c and Bcl-xl. Activation of CREB and NFκB—The question remained what transcription factor(s) could be responsible for up-regulation of such diverse targets as a component of a mitochondrial respiratory chain, cytochrome c, and a Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-xl. It had been shown in previous studies that CREB protein could be such a factor; CREB can transcriptionally regulate proteins of the mitochondrial respiratory chain as well as Bcl-2 family proteins (9Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar) and other targets. CREB often works in concert with another transcription factor, NFκB (11Mori N. Fujii M. Cheng G. Ikeda S. Yamasaki Y. Yamada Y. Tomonaga M. Yamamoto N. Virus Genes. 2001; 22: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). NFκB itself has been shown previously to regulate the expression of Bcl-xl (12Chen F. Demers L.M. Vallyathan V. Lu Y. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35591-35595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We, therefore, decided to test whether these systems were activated after treatment with diazoxide. Fig. 5A shows that in diazoxide-treated cells, there was an increased fraction of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) as well as an increased nuclear fraction of the p65/RelA regulatory subunit of NFκB. Quantitative analysis of Western blots is shown in Fig. 5B. Increased phosphorylation of CREB and an increased nuclear presence of the p65/RelA subunit of NFκB mark the activation of these factors. It should be noted that in HL60 cells, as in many other cancer cell lines and in contrast to normal non-malignant cell lines, pCREB and nuclear p65/RelA are present even in control cells (26Zhao L. Brinton R.D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4228-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). To further prove that the described transcription factors were indeed activated after diazoxide treatment, we performed heterologous luciferase promoter-reporter assays using either pCREB-luc or pNFκB-luc constructs as described previously (24Andela V.B. Sheu T.J. Puzas E.J. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Rosier R.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The assay confirmed activation of both CREB and NFκB (Fig. 5C). The activation of CREB and NFκB factors after diazoxide treatment was sensitive to 5-HD. Thus, we observed activation of CREB and NFκB transcription factors after treatment with diazoxide. Their activation was marked by increased phosphorylation and by an increased nuclear fraction of the p65/RelA subunit, respectively. The heterologous luciferase promoter-reporter assay also showed an increase in CREB and NFκB activities. Activation of NFκB Could Be Caused by Increased Cytosolic Calcium and Is Required for Preconditioning—The unanswered question was: what triggered activation of both CREB and NFκB after treatment with diazoxide? Both of these factors can be activated by elevated cytosolic calcium (16Hongpaisan J. Winters C.A. Andrews S.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Pahl H.L. Sester M. Burgert H.G. Baeuerle P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It has been suggested (28Holmuhamedov E.L. Jovanovic S. Dzeja P.P. Jovanovic A. Terzic A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1567-H1576PubMed Google Scholar) that diazoxide treatment may result in inhibition of mitochondrial calcium uptake and reduced mitochondrial calcium buffering capacity. As a result, cytosolic calcium may become elevated (29Herrington J. Park Y.B. Babcock D.F. Hille B. Neuron. 1996; 16: 219-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To test this, we loaded cells with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent probe Fura-2 AM and measured Fura-2 fluorescence in response to diazoxide treatment as described previously (25Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Maines M. Costa L.G. Reed D.J. Sassa S. Sipes I.G. Current Protocols in Toxicology. Wiley, NY1999: 2.5.1-2.5.53Google Scholar). The assay showed that cells treated with diazoxide for 1 h exhibit increased cytosolic calcium compared with the control (Fig. 6A). The elevation in cytosolic calcium was reversed by co-treatment with 5-HD. Chelation of cytosolic calcium with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA inhibited both CREB and NFκB (Fig. 6B, bar 4 in each panel) and prevented CREB and NFκB activation after diazoxide treatment (Fig. 6B, bar 5 in each panel). We could not check whether BAPTA-mediated inhibition of CREB and NFκB affected sensitivity of Dz-pretreated cells to etoposide because BAPTA itself has a protective effect during apoptosis in the described system (30Grabowski D.R. Dubyak G.R. Rybicki L. Hidaka H. Ganapathi R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).2 To investigate the importance of each transcription factor for the phenomenon of preconditioning, we incubated cells with diazoxide in the presence of either the CREB inhibitor H89 (31Hirayama T. Noda M. Ito H. Takeda Y. Microb. Pathog. 1990; 8: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) or the NFκB inhibitor SN50 (15Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) and then induced apoptosis. Although H89 effectively inhibited CREB (Fig. 6B, top panel, bar 2) and prevented CREB activation after diazoxide treatment (Fig. 6B, top panel, bar 3), it did not reverse preconditioning (data not shown). On the other hand, SN50 not only inhibited NFκB (Fig. 6B, bottom panel, bar 2) and prevented NFκB activation after diazoxide treatment (Fig. 6B, bottom panel, bar 3) but also abolished the effect of preconditioning and restored sensitivity to etoposide as shown in Fig. 6C. Therefore, NFκB appears to be a major factor responsible for the preconditioning because inhibition of NFκB restored sensitivity to etoposide. Both CREB and NFκB became activated possibly in response to elevation in cytosolic calcium caused directly or indirectly by diazoxide-mediated opening of mitoK-ATP channels. We have studied the effect of diazoxide on preconditioning. The results of our study are summarized in a diagram in Fig. 7. We have found that treatment with diazoxide caused moderate swelling and remodeling in about 40% of all analyzed mitochondria and increases in cytosolic fractions of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins, including cytochrome c. Observed remodeling of mitochondrial cristae could make cytochrome c available for release possibly through a small number of Bax/Bak oligomers constitutively present in the outer mitochondrial membrane. All of this led directly or indirectly to increases in cytosolic calcium, possibly because of disruption of mitochondrial calcium uptake. Such an effect of diazoxidemediated opening of the mitoK-ATP channels on mitochondrial calcium uptake has been observed in other studies (28Holmuhamedov E.L. Jovanovic S. Dzeja P.P. Jovanovic A. Terzic A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1567-H1576PubMed Google Scholar). Increased cytosolic calcium could activate the transcription factors CREB and NFκB. Activated CREB and NFκB induced the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xl and the respiratory chain protein cytochrome c. Increased expression of Bcl-xl shifted the ratio of anti- to pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in favor of anti-apoptotic. Overexpression of cytochrome c resulted in replenishment of a pool of this vitally important mitochondrial protein, which is otherwise lost during apoptosis. All of this led to protection of mitochondrial function and overall resistance to subsequent apoptotic stimuli. Recent literature suggests that there are effects of diazoxide and 5-HD not related to mitoK-ATP channels but related rather to metabolic stress. Such data are very important; however they are often applicable to higher concentrations of diazoxide (more than 100 μm) and to models using isolated mitochondria or submitochondrial particles. For instance, Holmuhamedov et al. (32Holmuhamedov E.L. Jahangir A. Oberlin A. Komarov A. Colombini M. Terzic A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) found that diazoxide at a concentration of 100 μm has protonophoretic properties in planar phospholipid membranes and in isolated mitochondria. However, as shown by Kowaltowski et al. (8Kowaltowski A. Seetharaman S. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H649-H657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), protonophoretic properties of diazoxide at concentrations less than 50 μm are insignificant. Hanley et al. (33Hanley P.J. Mickel M. Loffler M. Brandt U. Daut J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 542: 735-741Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar) found that diazoxide dose-dependently inhibits oxidation of succinate in submitochondrial particles. These authors argued that diazoxide may exert its preconditioning effect via inhibition of succinate-dependent respiration and a subsequent moderate increase in reactive oxygen species production and may result in PKC activation. In contrast to Hanley's hypothesis, Ferranti et al. (34Ferranti R. da Silva M.M. Kowaltowski A.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported that diazoxide actually reduced reactive oxygen species production by isolated mitochondria. Moreover, in our model system we saw not inhibition but stimulation of respiration by diazoxide (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it is unlikely that the effect was associated with inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase under our conditions. Kopustinskiene et al. (35Kopustinskiene D.M. Jovaisiene J. Liobikas J. Toleikis A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported that the diazoxide-stimulated respiration was not K+-dependent but was dependent on the mitochondrial ADP/ATP translocase; however, they used twice as much diazoxide (58 μm) and isolated mitochondria. Also, the molecular composition of the mitoK-ATP channel is still unknown, and it has been suggested that the ADP/ATP translocase may be a part of it (36Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 37Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, although there may be K+-independent effects of high concentrations of diazoxide on mitochondria, in our model system we did not see any inhibition of mitochondrial function. On the contrary, our data indicate stimulation of respiration in the absence of depolarization. The significance of our finding is that it identifies transcription factors CREB and NFκB as important mechanistic components during preconditioning. Activation of these transcription factors links the event specific to mitochondria, i.e. opening of the mitoK-ATP channels, to cytosolic events, i.e. elevation in cytosolic calcium and activation of the transcription factors CREB and NFκB, followed by nuclear response, i.e. increased expression of nuclear coded proteins, and as a result, to overall cellular response, i.e. enhanced resistance to an apoptotic signal.

https://openalex.org/W2015578861,"Photosystem I of higher plants is characterized by red-shifted spectral forms deriving from chlorophyll chromophores. Each of the four Lhca1 to -4 subunits exhibits a specific fluorescence emission spectrum, peaking at 688, 701, 725, and 733 nm, respectively. Recent analysis revealed the role of chlorophyll-chlorophyll interactions of the red forms in Lhca3 and Lhca4, whereas the basis for the fluorescence emission at 701 nm in Lhca2 is not yet clear. We report a detailed characterization of the Lhca2 subunit using molecular biology, biochemistry, and spectroscopy and show that the 701-nm emission form originates from a broad absorption band at 690 nm. Spectroscopy on recombinant mutant proteins assesses that this band represents the low energy form of an excitonic interaction involving two chlorophyll a molecules bound to sites A5 and B5, the same protein domains previously identified for Lhca3 and Lhca4. The resulting emission is, however, substantially shifted to higher energies. These results are discussed on the basis of the structural information that recently became available from x-ray crystallography (Ben Shem, A., Frolow, F., and Nelson, N. (2003) Nature 426, 630–635). We suggest that, within the Lhca subfamily, spectroscopic properties of chromophores are modulated by the strength of the excitonic coupling between the chromophores A5 and B5, thus yielding fluorescence emission spanning a large wavelength interval. It is concluded that the interchromophore distance rather than the transition energy of the individual chromophores or the orientation of transition vectors represents the critical factor in determining the excitonic coupling in Lhca pigment-protein complexes.

Photosystems I and II have a common general organization including a core complex moiety, binding Chl 1The abbreviations used are: Chl, chlorophyll; FWHM, full-width half-maximum; LD, linear dichroism; LHCI and LHCII, light-harvesting complex I and II, respectively; PSI and PSII, photosystem I and II, respectively; WT, wild type.a and β-carotene, and an outer antenna moiety, binding Chl a, Chl b, and xanthophylls. Nonetheless, their spectroscopic properties are substantially different. Both compartments of the PSI supercomplex are enriched in red-shifted chlorophyll absorption forms, whereas those of PSII are not. This property of PSI results in a preferential light harvesting in the near infrared spectral region (>700 nm) and causes the so-called “Emerson effect” that opened the way to the discovery of the two photosystems (1Evans J.R. Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1986; 10: 135-147Google Scholar). In green plants, LHCI, the outer antenna of PSI, is the most red form-enriched compartment and is composed of four different complexes, the products of the genes lhca1 to -4 (2Haworth P. Watson J.L. Arntzen C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 724: 151-158Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These complexes are located on one side of the core complex (3Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N.

Acta. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The Lhca proteins belong to the Lhc multigenic family, and they share high sequence homology with the antenna complexes of PSII (6Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Despite these strong similarities, the spectroscopic properties of Lhca and Lhcb complexes are very different. In particular, the emission spectrum of LHCI peaks at 733 nm, more than 50 nm red-shifted as compared with the emission spectra of the antenna system of PSII (LHCII) (7Ihalainen J.A. Gobets B. Sznee K. Brazzoli M. Croce R. Bassi R. van Grondelle R. Korppi-Tommola J.E.I. Dekker J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8625-8631Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In vitro reconstitution has shown that the red-shifted Chls are a common characteristic of Lhca complexes, although their energies differ strongly in different subunits. Emission forms at 701–702 nm have been found associated with Lhca1 and Lhca2, whereas 725- and 733-nm emissions were reported for Lhca3 and Lhca4, respectively (5Croce R. Morosinotto T.

It has been shown that the red emission of Lhca3 and Lhca4 originates from the low energy absorption band of an excitonic interaction involving Chl a in sites A5 and, probably, B5 (12Morosinotto T. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49223-49229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas the difference in energy is associated with the nature of the Chl A5 ligand, since the substitution of Asn in Lhca3 and Lhca4 by His, the usual ligand for Chl A5 in Lhc complexes, leads to the loss of the red spectral forms (12Morosinotto T. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49223-49229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the present work, we analyze in detail Lhca2 with the aim of understanding the origin of the 701-nm emission that dominates the fluorescence spectrum at low temperature. It should be noticed that Lhca bears His as a ligand for Chl A5, yet its fluorescence emission is red-shifted by 20 nm with respect to the highly homologous subunit Lhcb6 (CP24) and other Lhcb proteins, thus opening the question of whether a different mechanism of modulation for the physico-chemical properties of chromophores is at work in Lhca2. By performing a detailed analysis by biochemical and spectroscopic methods on WT and mutant Lhca recombinant proteins, we conclude that the fluorescence emission band at 701 nm derives from excitonic coupling between chromophores A5 and B5, despite the presence of a His ligand for Chl A5. These results are discussed on the basis of the structural information that recently became available from x-ray crystallography (1Evans J.R. Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1986; 10: 135-147Google Scholar, 13Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). We suggest that in green plant LHCI, differences in interchromophore distances rather than in transition energies of the individual chromophores of the interacting pair or in the orientation of their transition vectors represent the critical factor in determining excitonic coupling. DNA Constructions and Isolation of Overexpressed Lhca Apoproteins from Bacteria—cDNAs of Lhca2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (11Castelletti S. Morosinotto T. Robert B. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Croce R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4226-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were mutated with the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit, by Stratagene. WT and mutant apoproteins were isolated from the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli transformed with these constructs following a protocol previously described (14Nagai K. Thøgersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 15Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kuhlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Reconstitution and Purification of Protein-Pigment Complexes—Reconstitution and purification were performed as described in Ref. 16Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar with the following modifications. The reconstitution mixture contained 420 μg of apoprotein, 240 μg of chlorophylls, and 60 μg of carotenoids in a total of 1.1 ml. The Chl a/b ratio of the pigment mixture was 4.0. The pigments used were purified from spinach thylakoids. Protein and Pigment Concentration—High pressure liquid chromatography analysis was as in Ref. 17Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar. The chlorophyll to carotenoid ratio and Chl a/b ratios were independently measured by fitting the spectrum of acetone extracts with the spectra of individual purified pigments in 80% acetone (18Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7343Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy—The absorption spectra at room temperature and 77 K were recorded using an SLM-Aminco DK2000 spectrophotometer, in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol (60% at low temperature) and 0.06% β-dodecylglucomaltoside. Wavelength sampling step was 0.4 nm, scan rate was 100 nm/min, and optical path length was 1 cm. The absorption spectra at 4 K were measured using a home-built spectrophotometer at OD 0.5 in the same buffer as described above, but with 67% glycerol. Fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K were measured using a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorimeter and corrected for the instrumental response. The samples were excited at 440, 475, and 500 nm. The spectral bandwidth was 5 nm (excitation) and 3 nm (emission). The chlorophyll concentration was about 0.02 μg/ml in 60% glycerol and 0.03% β-dodecylglucomaltoside. The spectra between 130 and 4 K of the WT were measured with a 0.5-m imaging spectrograph (Chromex 500IS) and a CCD camera (Chromex Chromcam I). For broad band excitation, a tungsten halogen lamp (Oriel) was used with band pass filters transmitting at 420, 475, and 506 nm. For narrow band excitation, a dye laser (Coherent CR599) was used, which was pumped by an argon ion laser (Coherent Inova 310). The optical bandwidth of the laser was 0.6 nm, and the power was kept at 0.15 milliwatts/cm2. The spectra were corrected for the wavelength dependence of the detection system. CD spectra were measured at 10 °C on a Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter. The wavelength sampling step was 0.5 nm, the scan rate 100 nm/min, and spectra were recorded with eight accumulations. The OD of the samples was 1 at the maximum in the Qy transition for all complexes, and the samples were in the same solution as described for the absorption measurements. All spectra presented were normalized to the polypeptide concentration based on the Chl binding stoichiometry. LD spectra were measured as described in Ref. 19Haworth P. Tapie P. Arntzen C.J. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 152-159Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar using samples oriented by the polyacrylamide gel squeezing technique. Analysis of Lhca2-WT Complex—Lhca2 WT was obtained by overexpression of the apoprotein in E. coli and reconstitution in vitro with pigments. The complex was purified from excess pigment and unfolded apoprotein by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, anion exchange chromatography, and glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation and was obtained in monomeric form, as previously described (11Castelletti S. Morosinotto T. Robert B. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Croce R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4226-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Absorption—The absorption spectrum of Lhca2 at 4 K shows its maximum in the Chl Qy region at 679.5 nm, whereas in the Chl b region two local maxima can be detected at 644 and 652 nm (Fig. 1). The second derivative analysis allows resolution of several absorption forms: three Chl b at 643, 651, and 653 nm and four Chl a at 661, 672, 680.5, and 688.5 nm. In the blue region, the minimum at 497 nm is associated to the redmost peak (S0 > S2,0 transition) of the carotenoids, whereas those at 480 and 471 nm may represent the Soret bands of two Chl b spectral forms. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra of Lhca2 were measured at different temperatures upon excitation in the blue spectral region (Fig. 2). Two emission forms at 688 and 701 nm can be detected. The latter dominates the spectrum at 4 K, but the 688-nm form is still present, indicating that the energy transfer between these two forms is not complete, thus suggesting some kind of heterogeneity in the sample. In order to obtain information on the origin of the two fluorescence emissions, fluorescence emission spectra upon selective excitation in the Qy band of the complex were measured. A selection of spectra is presented in Fig. 3A. The relative contribution of the 688- and 701-nm forms changed as a function of the excitation wavelength. In particular, the 688-nm emission reached its maximum for excitations in the 680–683-nm range, indicating that it originates from the red part of the bulk absorption. For excitation above 685 nm, the amplitude of the 688-nm emission band drops considerably, and the spectrum is dominated by the low energy emission form. In Fig. 3B, the excitation wavelength is plotted versus the maximum of the emission (squares). By increasing the excitation wavelength from 680 to 685 nm, a blue shift of the emission maximum of the redmost form to 697 nm (excitation at 685 nm) is observed. This blue shift is due to the contribution to the emission of a larger fraction of “red” pigments absorbing in the blue wing of the inhomogeneous distribution, which are selectively excited at this wavelength (20Gobets B. Van Amerongen H. Monshouwer R. Kruip J. Rögner M. van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 75-85Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21den Hartog F.T.H. Dekker J.P. van Grondelle R. Völker S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 11007-11016Crossref Google Scholar). Above 685 nm, the emission maximum undergoes a red shift, exhibiting a linear relation with the excitation wavelength, thus reaching a value of 701 nm for excitation at 690 nm. By exciting in the redmost part of the absorption spectrum, a further red shift of the emission maximum was observed. For excitations within the red tail of the absorption spectrum (around 710 nm), the emission maximum is still broad (340 cm–1), indicating large homogeneous broadening. Moreover, for excitation above 700 nm, site selection does not have a strong influence on the shape and the width of the emission, thus suggesting that the spectrum is dominated by inhomogeneous broadening. The site-selected fluorescence data allow also determining the peak wavelength of the absorption form responsible for the 701-nm emission. This value corresponds to the excitation wavelength at which the emission peak coincides with that in spectra obtained from nonselective excitation (see Ref. 20Gobets B. Van Amerongen H. Monshouwer R. Kruip J. Rögner M. van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 75-85Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar for more details). By following this procedure, the absorption maximum of the red band is calculated to be approximately at 690 nm, in agreement with the second derivative analysis of the absorption spectrum, which showed the redmost absorption form at 688.5 nm (see Fig. 1). Additional information on the characteristics of the red absorption tail can be obtained by fluorescence anisotropy measurements, which gives an indication of the orientation of the absorbing and emitting dipoles. In Fig. 3B (circles), the values of the fluorescence anisotropy detected at 701 nm are reported as a function of the excitation wavelength. It is clear that the values of the anisotropy also depend on the excitation wavelength. Upon excitation around 680 nm, the anisotropy value is low, and it rises to a maximum of 0.32 for excitation wavelength above 697 nm, a value very similar to that obtained in the analysis of the 702-nm emission form in a native LHCI preparation (7Ihalainen J.A. Gobets B. Sznee K. Brazzoli M. Croce R. Bassi R. van Grondelle R. Korppi-Tommola J.E.I. Dekker J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8625-8631Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This result indicates that above this wavelength, no depolarization due to energy transfer takes place, thus suggesting that the same band is responsible for the absorption and the emission. The alternative hypothesis of energy transfer between pigments having the same dipole transition orientation is extremely unlikely. LD Spectra—The LD spectrum of Lhca2 shows strong positive contribution in the Chl a Qy absorption region, with a maximum at 679.5 nm and a shoulder around 690 nm (Fig. 4). The signal becomes slightly negative at 667 nm. In the Chl b absorption region, a positive contribution is observed at 653 nm. The reduced LD spectrum (LD/3A) shows the largest value around 690 nm, indicating that the Chl(s) responsible for this absorption forms is oriented with the largest angle with respect to the normal to the membrane plane. A second positive LD value corresponds to the maximum of the absorption spectrum (679.4 nm), whereas a local minimum is present at 683 nm. Localization of the Low Energy Absorbing Form(s) into the Lhca2 Structure—The above measurements strongly indicate that the red-shifted fluorescence signal at 701 nm is associated with an absorption form peaking at 690 nm. In order to identify which chromophore is responsible for this absorption, mutation analysis at selected Chl-binding residues was performed. Based on previous analysis with Lhca3 and Lhca4 (12Morosinotto T. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49223-49229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), residues coordinating Chl A5, B5, and B6, involved in the low energy absorption forms, were mutated to nonbinding residues (i.e. which cannot coordinate the central magnesium of the Chls) (see Table I for details). The apoprotein was expressed in E. coli, and the complex was reconstituted in vitro with pigments. In all cases, stable monomeric complexes were obtained. The pigment content of the complexes is shown in Table I.Table IPigment composition of the complexesSampleMutationChl a/bChl/CaroteonidChl totalLuteinViolaxanthinRLhca2-WT2.15.0101.680.32RLhca2-A5H52F2.24.581.410.35RLhca2-B5E108V/R111L4.7471.440.3RLhca2-B6E100V3.14.491.570.25 Open table in a new tab The decreased Chl/Car ratio observed in all mutants indicates loss of Chls in the Chl binding site mutants, and the higher Chl a/b ratio as compared with the WT complex implies that Chl b molecules are preferentially lost. Normalization to the carotenoid content would indicate loss of one Chl in the A5 mutant, two Chls in B5, and one Chl in B6. However, this stoichiometry may not be correct in the case of mutants A5 and B5, since the corresponding mutants in all other Lhca complexes showed a loss of carotenoid molecules. Moreover, loss of one Chl in A5 would indicate that this site has mixed occupancy, which is very unlikely, because the A5 site has been found to accommodate one Chl a molecule in all complexes analyzed so far (22Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 23Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We thus suggest that the A5 mutant loses two Chls molecules, one Chl a and one Chl b, as was the case in Lhca1, whereas a small loss of carotenoids accounts for the change in Chl/Car ratio. The B5 mutant loses most probably three Chl molecules, two Chls b and one Chl a. The loss of Chl a is consistent with the analysis of the absorption spectrum (see below), which is strongly affected in the Chl a Qy absorption region. To check the influence of the mutation on the 701-nm emission form of the complex, fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K were measured (Fig. 5). Mutant A5 and B5 showed emission maximum at 686 nm, thus shifted by 15 nm to the blue as compared with the WT peak, indicating that both mutations affect the low energy emission form. The fluorescence emission of the B6 mutant was, instead, very similar to that of the WT, showing that mutation at this Chl binding site does not influence the chromophore(s) responsible for the 701-nm emission. The absorption spectra of the three mutants and the WT at 77 K are presented in Fig. 6A and the second derivative of the spectra are shown in Fig. 6B. Mutant A5 was mainly affected in the Chl a region, where the absorption form at 690 nm disappeared. A decrease in the amplitude of the spectrum in the Chl b region could also be observed, in agreement with the Chl b loss (see Table I). Mutant B5 showed dramatic changes in the absorption spectrum as compared with the WT; not only two Chl b forms (at 642 any 651 nm) were lost, but also a 688-nm absorbing Chl a form. Absorption at 680 nm was also decreased and was partially compensated by the increased signal at 670 nm, possibly due to the presence of unconnected Chls. Mutant B6 was affected mainly in the Chl b region, where the absorption at 642 nm disappeared, an indication that the Chl b accommodated in the B6 site absorbs at this wavelength. Minor changes could also be detected in the Chl a absorption region. Interestingly, the effect of the mutation at site B6 on the red-shifted absorption forms is different in Lhca2 as compared with Lhca1 (24Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and Lhca4. 2T. Morosinotto, R. Bassi, and R. Croce unpublished results. In these homologous proteins, loss of Chl B6 significantly affected the red-shifted emission forms. This difference may be related to the observation that the B6 mutants of Lhca1 and Lhca4 lose xanthophylls, whereas Lhca2 did not. The loss of red forms in Lhca1 and Lhca4 upon mutation at site B6 was interpreted as an indirect effect mediated by the carotenoid molecule (24Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The different results obtained for the B6 mutant in Lhca2 seem to indicate that the carotenoid organization in the Lhca complexes is different with respect to others Lhca subunits. The CD spectra at room temperature of WT and mutants are reported in Fig. 7. Mutant A5 is identical in the Chl b region to the WT but shows strong differences in the Chl a region. Comparison with the WT spectrum indicates that this mutant loses a negative CD signal at 687 nm and a positive one at 672 nm, thus suggesting loss of an excitonic interaction. A strong decrease in the intensity of the CD signal in the Chl b region is observed for both B6 and B5 mutants, thus implying that the Chl b molecules lost in the B5 and B6 mutants participate in pigment-pigment interactions. In particular, the comparison of the spectra of the WT with the one of mutant B6 shows that, in the latter, the loss of the negative signal in the Chl b region is connected with the loss of a positive contribution in the Chl a region (around 670 nm), thus suggesting the presence of a Chl b-Chl a interaction. The current results show that Lhca2 takes a unique position within the LHCI proteins. Unlike Lhca3 and Lhca4, it does not show strong absorption above 700 nm, but nevertheless its emission is still 22-nm red-shifted as compared with the emission maxima of all Lhcb complexes. In the case of Lhca3 and Lhca4, it was shown that the red absorption is associated with the presence of an Asn as ligand for Chl A5 (12Morosinotto T. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49223-49229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This is not the case of Lhca2, which has a His in this position, a feature shared with all Lhcb proteins that do not show red-shifted Chl forms. We thus proceeded with the analysis of the chromophore organization in Lhca2 and identified the absorption band responsible for the 701-nm emission band, with the aim of understanding the mechanism that allows modulation of the physicochemical properties of chlorophyll ligands. Lhca2 has been shown to have the emission maximum at 701 nm (at 4 K). A second emission form was also detected at 688 nm in the 4 K spectrum, thus suggesting heterogeneity in the sample. Several sources of spectroscopic heterogeneity have been reported for Lhc proteins, including phosphorylation-induced spectral changes in CP29 (25Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11142-11148Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the presence of multiple gene products in the LHCII preparations with different spectral features (26Caffarri S. Croce R. Cattivelli L. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9467-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and conformational changes induced by zeaxanthin binding to site L2 (27Moya I. Silvestri M. Vallon O. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 28Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present work, a recombinant Lhca2 preparation was analyzed, which was the product of a single gene, did not contain zeaxanthin, was monomeric as detected by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and was not phosphorylated. We conclude that the persistence of the two fluorescence emission bands is the product of a previously unrecognized source of molecular heterogeneity, which is reflected in the establishment or not of the molecular feature responsible for the 701-nm emission. Two hypotheses can be proposed for explanation of these data; either the Lhca2 protein is present into two conformations in which the two interacting chromophores are set at different distances and/or different orientations with respect to each other, or one of the two sites can be occupied by either Chl a or Chl b. The difference in transition energies between Chl a and Chl b and the difference in the orientation of the transition vectors (29Van Amerongen H. van Grondelle R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 604-617Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar) would make the observable spectral shift of a Chl a/Chl b interaction much smaller with respect to that of a Chl a/Chl a interaction. The likelihood of these hypotheses will be discussed below. Site-selected fluorescence measurements indicate that the 689-nm emission originates from bulk Chls absorbing around 682 nm, whereas the 701-nm emission form is associated with a Chl absorption form at 690 nm. This result is confirmed by the mutation analysis, which showed that both mutants losing the 701-nm emission also lack the 690-nm absorption form. Spectral Characteristics of the 690-nm Absorption Form—In order to get more details on the 690-nm absorption form of Lhca2, the absorption spectrum of the WT complex was described in terms of Gaussian forms, using the values obtained by second derivative analysis as starting parameters (Fig. 8). Three Chl b bands were needed to describe the region between 640 and 660 nm, namely at 642, 649, and 655 nm. The red part of the Qy Chl a absorption region was described with two Gaussians at 686 and 690 nm, with the latter showing a broadened spectrum. An oscillation strength corresponding to the absorption of 0.85 Chl a molecules is associated with this band. This description is in good agreement with the fluorescence data; the redmost band, which is responsible for the 701-nm emission, absorbs at 690 nm, as suggested by the site-selected fluorescence measurements, and a sec"
https://openalex.org/W2041559240,"The proto-oncogene, bcl-2, has various functions besides its role in protecting cells from apoptosis. One of the functions is to regulate expression of other genes. Previous studies have demonstrated that Bcl-2 regulates activities of several important transcription factors including NF-κB and p53, and also their downstream genes. In our recent studies, we reported that Bcl-2 substantially downregulates expression of the endogenous αB-crystallin gene through modulating the transcriptional activity of lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF). In the present communication, we report that human Bcl-2 can positively regulate expression of the proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos. Moreover, it enhances the DNA binding activity and transactivity of the activating protein-1 (AP-1). Furthermore, we present evidence to show that Bcl-2 can also activate both ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases. Inhibition of the activities of these kinases or the upstream activating kinases by pharmacological inhibitors or dominant-negative mutants abolishes the Bcl-2-mediated regulation of AP-1, LEDGF and their downstream genes. Together, our results demonstrate that through activation of the ERK kinase signaling pathway, Bcl-2 regulates the transcriptional activities of multiple transcription factors, and hence modulates the expression of their downstream genes. Thus, our results provide a mechanism to explain how Bcl-2 may regulate expression of other genes."
https://openalex.org/W1974234869,"We have investigated the mechanism responsible for mitochondria permeabilization occurring during cell apoptosis. We have developed an in vivo model of apoptotic rat liver. Mitochondria appeared as an homogenous population in control liver. On the contrary, mitochondria varied in size, morphology, and the matrical density in apoptotic liver. Mitochondria were purified from control and apoptotic livers. In control conditions, a single mitochondrial population was identified; whereas three populations of mitochondria were purified from apoptotic liver. Our data show that these apoptotic populations correspond to early, intermediate, and late apoptotic mitochondria, which are characterized by an increasing extent of permeabilization of their outer membrane and a gradual enrichment in oligomerized Bax protein. Remarkably, a new ionic channel was observed in apoptotic but not in control mitochondria. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of this channel are in good agreement with those reported for a previously described mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC) (Pavlov, E.

However, MAC activity was only observed in the late apoptotic mitochondrial population.

However, MAC activity was only observed in the late apoptotic mitochondrial population. Thus, our study establishes that MAC activity is related to the overall apoptotic process but corresponds to a late event. Cell apoptosis is of primary importance in the control of organ and tissue development, as well as in cell organization and homeostasis (reviewed in Ref. 1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Defaults in the execution or regulation of the apoptotic program have been involved in proliferative as well as degenerative pathologies (reviewed in Ref. 2Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar). Apoptosis results from highly coordinated biochemical events (reviewed in Ref. 3Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar), among which the recruitment of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bax or Bak at the mitochondria constitutes a major checkpoint conditioning the engagement of cell degradation (4Borner C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 71-72Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is now well admitted that mitochondria undergo general permeabilization upon their interaction with Bax or Bak proteins (5Degli-Esposti M. Dive C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Following this, apoptogenic proteins of the mitochondrial intermembrane space are released into the cytosol, thus triggering the activation of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent degradation of the cell compounds. Interestingly, the release of proapoptotic mitochondrial factors occurs with different kinetics (6Arnoult D. Parone P. Martinou J.C. Antonsson B. Estaquier J. Ameisen J.C. J.

Despite the wealth of in vitro and in vivo investigations, the molecular mechanism responsible for Bax-dependent MOM permeabilization is still controversial and several, although non-exclusive, hypothetical models have been considered (8Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R71-R73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In an early model, Bax has been described as an efficient activator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) (9Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L.

Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14681-14686Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Bax-induced PTP activation leads to an outer membrane rupture through mitochondrial swelling. Supporting this, modulators of PTP activity modulate Bax-induced mitochondrial permeabilization (reviewed in Ref. 11Brenner C. Le Bras M. Kroemer G. J. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 23: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bax can promote new channel activity in artificial membrane bearing adenine nucleotide translocators (12Brenner C. Cadiou H. Vieira H.L. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Xie Z. Leber B. Andrews D. Duclohier H. Reed J.C. Kroemer G.

Cohen I. Prevost M.C. Larquet E. Pariselli F. Petit P.X. Kahn A. Rizzuto R. Brenner C. Kroemer G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 541-546PubMed Google Scholar). However, in several cases of Bax-mediated cell apoptosis, mitochondrial swelling is not observed and has been reported to be independent of a PTP activation (14Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A.

An alternative model has been developed in which Bax inserts MOM and forms a pore facilitating intermembrane space protein diffusion through MOM.

Rostovtseva T. Montessuit S. Martinou J.C. Antonsson B. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In another hypothesis, Bax modifies resident MOM channels. Strengthening this, an increase in VDAC conduction properties has been reported upon its interaction with Bax (20Shimizu S. Ide T. Yanagida T. Tsujimoto Y. J. Biol.

Recently, patch clamp investigations of MOM electrophysiological properties revealed a new channel (the so-called MAC for mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel) in mitochondria purified from an apoptotic cell line and bax-expressing yeast were investigated (26Pavlov E.V. Priault M. Pietkiewicz D. Cheng E.H. Antonsson B. Manon S. Korsmeyer S.J. Mannella C.A. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). MAC corresponded to a large conductance, and cytochrome c interacting channel (26Pavlov E.V. Priault M. Pietkiewicz D. Cheng E.H. Antonsson B. Manon S. Korsmeyer S.J. Mannella C.A. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 27Guo L. Pietkiewicz D. Pavlov E.V. Grigoriev S.M. Kasianowicz J.J. Dejean L.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Antonsson B. Kinnally K.W. Am.

Accordingly, MAC has been postulated to correspond to the channel responsible for cytochrome c efflux through MOM during cell apoptosis. In the present work, we have investigated the relevance of MAC in a more physiological model of apoptosis induced in rat liver. Our results show that in vivo MAC is a functional component of the envelope of apoptotic mitochondria, the biophysical and pharmacological properties of which are established here for the first time. However, because MAC is specifically observed in late apoptotic mitochondria, we propose that MAC does not correspond to the structure responsible for the early mitochondrial permeabilization observed in cell apoptosis. Animals and Chemicals—Escherichia coli LPS serotype 0127:B8, d-galN, apo-cytochrome c, cytochrome c, lysozyme, cyclosporin A, and atractyloside were from Sigma. All salts and buffers used here were analytical grade. In Vivo Liver Apoptosis—200–250 g of BD IX rats received an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (50 mg kg–1 body weight) and d-galN (1 g· kg–1 body weight) solubilized in sterile NaCl (treated rats) or an injection of sterile NaCl (0.9%, w/v) only (sham-treated rats). 5 h and 30 min after the beginning of the treatment, sham-treated and treated rats were euthanized by a lethal injection of ketamine (10 mg/ml) and xylazine (0.8% w/v). Animals were starved from diet but provided with fresh water within the 6 h preceding their euthanasia. Biochemistry—Purification of liver mitochondria was performed at 4 °C as described earlier (29Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, liver was harvested immediately after animal euthanasia and was homogenized with 5 volumes of an extraction buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes-K, pH 7.0, in an Elvehjem motor driven Teflon pestle (20 strokes, 1,000 rpm). Liver homogenate was cleared from cell debris and nuclei by a 1,200 × g centrifugation (20 min) and the crude mitochondrial fraction was pelleted by a 8,700 × g centrifugation (15 min). After two washes by 300 mm mannitol, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), crude mitochondrial fraction was layered onto the top of a discontinuous Percoll™ gradient prepared in 300 mm mannitol, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) and consisting of 2 ml of Percoll™ 70%, 3 ml Percoll™ 30%, 2 ml of Percoll™ 18%, and 2 ml of Percoll™ 10%. Gradients were centrifuged (9,000 × g, 45 min), and the different mitochondrial fractions were collected at the different Percoll™ interfaces. Mitochondria were washed twice with 300 mm mannitol, 10 MOPS (pH 7.0) and were kept at –80 °C after their freezing in liquid N2. The liver cytosolic fraction was obtained from liver homogenate cleared from intracellular membranes by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 90 min). Proteins into the different samples were determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard. DEVDase activity was measured on liver cytosolic fractions originating from sham-treated and treated rats, using the fluorogenic caspase-3-specific substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC, Promega), added in the presence of Triton X-100 (0.01%, v/v) (29Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The assay consisted in a quintuplet measurement of DEVDase activity performed for 3 sham-treated and 3 treated rats. The data corresponded to the mean ± S.E. of the results and were expressed in arbitrary units. For Western blots experiments, cytosolic or mitochondrial proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide running gel. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA) were used for protein transfer (15 V, 15–30 min). Antibodies directed against Bax (isotype Δ21, 1/200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, San Diego, CA), Bid (1/1000, BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), F1-ATPase β-subunit (1/1000, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), cytochrome c (1/1000, RD Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and Smac/Diablo (1/500, ProSci. Inc., Poway, CA) were used for immunoblot analysis. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1/2000) and the ECL-revelation kit (Amersham Biosciences) were used for protein detection. Signal was quantified using IP Lab gel software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). Cross-linking experiments were realized using the homo-bifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate according the manufacturer's procedure (Pierce). Briefly, mitochondria (50 μg of protein) were incubated (2 h, 4 °C) in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (pH 7.5) in the presence of disuccinimidyl suberate (1 mm). The reaction was blocked by the addition of 1 m Tris (pH 7.5) (10 mm final concentration), and proteins (50 μg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide running gel) and immunoblotting using anti-Bax Δ21 antibody (1/200). Microscopy—Fresh livers were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C. They were then fixed in phosphate-buffered saline + paraformaldehyde (4% w/v, 4 °C, overnight) and further incubated during 24 h at room temperature. After embedding in paraffin, tissue was cut in 5-μm sections. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-phloxin and observed with a conventional visible light microscope (Olympus BH2). For electronic microscopy, liver samples from control and treated rats were fixed in sodium cacodylate (100 mm, pH 7.2) containing 3% (w/v) OsO4, rinsed by 300 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2) and 64.5 mm NaCl, then dehydrated with ethanol at increasing grades. Samples were washed by propylene oxide before their inclusion in Epon 812. Ultrathin slices were stained by uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Observations were performed onto a TEM JEM 1010 (Philips). Electrophysiology—Mitochondrial membranes were harvested (100,000 × g, 30 min) from mitochondria submitted to an osmotic down-shock in 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0). Giant proteoliposomes were formed as described earlier (30Guihard G. Proteau S. Payet M.D. Escande D. Rousseau E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) by mixing 10–50 μg of mitochondrial membrane proteins with 1 mg of azolectine (soybean type IV, Sigma). The mixture was frozen (liquid N2) and thawed (room temperature) 3 times and 10-μl aliquots were spotted onto a 96-well plate. Samples were dehydrated under vacuum at room temperature (3 h) and rehydrated overnight (4 °C) in the presence of 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-K (pH 7.0). The proteoliposomes formed in these conditions were layered onto a 35-mm Petri dish containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes-K (pH 7.0). Single channel experiments were conducted using 20–25 MΩ patch clamp pipettes filled with 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes-K (pH 7.0). After sealing, the proteoliposome membrane was excised and rapidly air/water interfaced to prevent further membrane vesicularization. The membrane patch was superfused using an homemade local perfusion system containing different media. Single channel currents were monitored using the voltage-clamp configuration of the patch clamp technique. Applied voltage (Vm) corresponded to (Vpip – Vbath) with Vbath virtually grounded to 0 mV. Currents were amplified using an Axopatch 200B apparatus (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and digitized using a Labmaster A/D converter (Scientific Solution). Current traces were stored on a digital audio tape DTR 1202 (Bio-Logic, Pont de Claix, France), then played back with a low-pass filter frequency between 1.2 and 2.5 kHz (Burr-Stroud EF5–20 filter). Sampling frequency adjustment (between 4 and 7.5 kHz) and current analysis were performed by using pClamp 9.0 software (Axon Instruments). Single channel conductance (γ) was calculated from the current-voltage (I/V) relationship. Theoretical diameter of the pore (Ø) was deduced from the following equation,∅(in nm)=2(γ·ρ·1/Π)0.5(Eq. 1) where γ is the channel conductance (in S), ρ is the resistivity of the solution (∼0.8 Ω.m), and l is the minimal length of the pore (7 × 10–9 m), which corresponds to the membrane width. Ion channel selectivity was deduced from the current reverse potential value (Erev) introduced into the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. Channel open probability (Po) was measured on current traces lasting at least 1 min. Data Analysis—Images were generated from scanned pictures using an Epson 2120 photo deluxe scanner (1200 dpi resolution) and Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe) software. Numerical and statistical data were analyzed using Sigma-Plot and Sigma-Stat (Jandel Scientific) software. In Vivo LPS and d-galN Treatment Induces Liver Apoptosis That Is Related to the Mitochondrial Pathway—In mouse, the intraperitoneal injection of LPS and d-galN has been shown to promote fulminant hepatitis through the recruitment of the tumor necrosis factor-α/tumor necrosis factor receptor pathway, Bid protein proteolytic activation, Bax protein targeting to mitochondria, and the subsequent release of cytochrome c (31Nowak M. Gaines G.C. Rosenberg J. Minter R. Bahjat F.R. Rectenwald J. MacKay S.L. Edwards 3rd, C.K. Moldawer L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: R1202-R1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zhao Y. Li S.

In the present study, we have verified that rat liver developed a massive apoptosis upon LPS + d-galN treatment. Liver parenchymal organization exhibited strong histological alterations with large foci of inflammation (Fig. 1, A and B) upon the treatment by LPS + d-galN. Vacuolized cells as well as cells with fragmented nuclei could be identified and numerous apoptotic bodies were also observed in these conditions (Fig. 1, A and B). The cleavage of the pro-apoptotic protein Bid was clearly observed in liver cytosol originating from treated rats (Fig. 1C). The Bid/t-Bid ratio decreased in treated rats (1.56 ± 0.26, n = 3) when compared with that of sham-treated rats (4.5 ± 0.52, n = 3). Finally, a ∼3 times enhancement of caspase-3 activity was observed in the cytosolic fraction of treated rats when compared with that of sham-treated ones (Fig. 1D). Taken as a whole, our data show that rat liver underwent a general mitochondrial apoptosis upon LPS + d-galN treatment, thus, establishing for the first time a rat model of liver cell apoptosis. Different Mitochondrial Populations Are Produced during in Vivo Liver Apoptosis—The ultrastructure of control and apoptotic livers was examined (Fig. 2, A and B). Control hepatocytes contained homogenous mitochondria regarding their size, morphology, and matricial electronic density (Fig. 2A). On the contrary, a large mitochondrial pleomorphism could be seen in apoptotic hepatocytes (Fig. 2B). We identified a co-existence of normally sized mitochondria with undamaged envelope and numerous inner membrane crests with swollen mitochondria exhibiting no inner membrane crest and an empty matrix (Fig. 2B). Mitochondria were purified through density gradient. Control mitochondria resulted in a single population (the so-called HCM for heavy control mitochondria), at the 1.051/1.096 g/ml density interface (Table I). It represented 83.2 ± 4.8% of the crude fraction, the remaining material being dispersed into the gradient. Apoptotic mitochondria were separated in three populations, namely HAM for heavy apoptotic mitochondria, LAM1 for light apoptotic mitochondria fraction 1, and LAM2 for light apoptotic mitochondria fraction 2 (Table I). HAM density corresponded to that of the HCM fraction, whereas LAM1 and LAM2 fractions exhibited lower densities (Table I). HAM, LAM1, and LAM2 fractions accounted for 66.5 ± 5.0, 16.3 ± 3.4, and 10.2 ± 4.6% of the crude apoptotic mitochondrial fraction, respectively (Table I). The purification procedure did not generate a physical alteration of HCM and HAM fractions, because their re-loading onto the density gradient resulted in the recovery of a single population located at the 1.051/1.096 g/ml density interface (data not shown).Table IProperties of the mitochondrial populationsCrude fractionApparent densityMean diameter%g ml-1μm ± S.E.HCM83.2 ± 4.8 (n = 7)1.051 < d < 1.0960.91 ± 0.18 (n = 450)HAM66.5 ± 5.0 (n = 7)1.051 < d < 1.0960.92 ± 0.26 (n = 450)LAM116.3 ± 3.4 (n = 7)1.037 < d < 1.051NDaND, not determined.LAM210.2 ± 4.6 (n = 7)1.028 < d < 1.0371.50 ± 0.24 (n = 450)a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab HCM, HAM, LAM1, and LAM2 corresponded to the entire mitochondria delimited by a double membrane envelope (Fig. 2, C–F). HCM and HAM exhibited conventional crest-forming inner membranes and a dense matrix (Figs. 2, C and D). These mitochondria did not differ in size because of similar mean diameter values (Table I). LAM1 were complex with different sizes, with different outer and inner membranes patterns, and with different matrix electronic densities (Fig. 2E). LAM2 corresponded to a swollen population (Fig. 2F). The mean diameter of LAM2 was 1.5 ± 0.24 μm (Table I). We observed a drastic reduction of the LAM2 matricial content (Fig. 2D) when compared with those of HCM and HAM (Fig. 2, C and D). Ruptures of the outer membrane were detected in the majority of LAM2 mitochondria (Fig. 2F). A biochemical characterization of the different mitochondrial populations was realized (Fig. 3). In agreement with previous data (33Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), we have observed a weak but significant association of Bax with control mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Bax was also present in apoptotic mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Using the F1-ATPase β subunit as an internal standard (Fig. 3A) (33Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), the amount of Bax was quantified (Fig. 3B). Our results show an enrichment of Bax protein in apoptotic mitochondria when compared with that observed in control mitochondria (Fig. 3B). Because Bax oligomerization has been shown to be involved in Bax-induced mitochondrial permeabilization (33Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 34Manon S. Chaudhuri B. Guerin M.

Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar), cross-linking experiments were realized on the different populations of mitochondria purified from control and apoptotic livers. Our results show that Bax was mainly present as a monomer in the HAM population (Fig. 3C), whereas most of Bax protein associated with LAM2 was recovered in a ∼80-kDa oligomer (Fig. 3C). The oligomerization state of Bax associated with LAM1A was complex, we detected Bax in two oligomers of ∼40 and ∼80 kDa. Bax insertion and oligomerization were paralleled with MOM permeabilization, because apoptotic mitochondria exhibited cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo contents lower than those found in control (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, we observed a progressive reduction in the cytochrome c content of the different apoptotic populations. Indeed, cytochrome c in HAM, LAM1, and LAM2 corresponded to ∼48, ∼25, and ∼10% of that found in the HCM population. Thus, our data established a direct correlation between the amount and the oligomerization state of mitochondrial Bax and the extent of mitochondrial permeabilization in our conditions. Taken as a whole, these data strongly indicate that HAM, LAM1, and LAM2 populations represent different chronological steps of Bax-related MOM permeabilization that was generated in vivo. Electrophysiological Analysis of Mitochondrial Populations—We have investigated the electrophysiological properties of the different populations of apoptotic mitochondria and compared them to those of control mitochondria. Because the LAM1 population composition appeared heterogenous on electron micrographs, we focused our study on HCM, HAM, and LAM2. A voltage-dependent anionic channel (VDAC) was observed in 28.6, 29.9, and 28.1% of the cases for HCM, HAM, and LAM2, respectively (Table II). These values were not statistically different. VDAC biophysical properties are given in Fig. 4. VDACs of HCM, HAM, and LAM2 displayed similar longlasting transitions from open state to low conductance substrates (Fig. 4A). The number of subconducting states increased as the membrane became more polarized (Fig. 4A). This was observed at both positive and negative membrane potentials (Fig. 4A). From I/Vm curves established in symmetrical (150/150 mm KCl) and asymmetrical (150/50 mm KCl) conditions (Fig. 4B), we calculated γsym = 702 ± 18 pS (n = 16) and γasym = 663 ± 41 pS (n = 28), γsym = 694 ± 23 pS (n = 18) and γasym = 638 ± 27 pS (n = 26), γsym = 678 ± 35 pS (n = 25) and γasym = 648 ± 38 pS (n = 29), for HCM, HAM, and LAM2, respectively. Furthermore, we determined PCl/PK = 1.97, PCl/PK = 2.02, and PCl/PK = 2.31 for HCM, HAM, and LAM2, respectively (Fig. 4B). Po/Vm curves displayed typical bell-shaped relationships (Fig. 4C) and the parameters of the voltage dependence are given in Table III. VDAC gating charges were found to be similar for control and apoptotic mitochondrial populations in both positive and negative potential ranges. Calculation of V0.5 show no differences between control and apoptotic populations (Table III), although we observed a +10 mV right-shift for LAM2 VDAC in the positive potential range when compared with VDAC found in HCM and HAM populations. Finally, VDAC activation energy values were found to be similar when control and apoptotic mitochondria were considered (Table III).Table IIMitochondrial ion channelsNumber of observationsHCM (n = 98)HAM (n = 87)LAM2 (n = 103)VDAC282629PTPaPTP was observed after adding 2 mm CaCl2 in the superfusion medium.332MAC0018a PTP was observed after adding 2 mm CaCl2 in the superfusion medium.

https://openalex.org/W2162362760,"slug gene expression is associated with the specification and migration of neural crest cells in the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. We provide evidence that the protein Ying-Yang 1 (YY1) regulates the slug gene expression both indirectly and directly, via a YY1 cis-element in the slug promoter, during Xenopus development. The ability of the YY1 to bind this YY1 cis-element was confirmed by electromobility shift assays and reporter assays. YY1 was detected in the nuclei of ectodermal cells contemporaneously with the process of neural crest specification. The injection of anti-YY1 morpholino, which targeted both YY1α and YY1β gene products, depleted YY1 expression below 20% and was lethal at gastrulation. Sublethal depletion of YY1 reduced the length of the anterior-posterior axis and severely inhibited the expression of the neural marker Nrp1 and of the slug gene. Overexpression of YY1 or mutation of the YY1 cis-element reduced the restricted spatial expression of the slug reporter gene in the neural ectoderm border and provoked its expression in the nonneural ectoderm. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that endogenous YY1 interacts directly with the YY1 cis-element of the endogenous slug gene and with the slug gene reporter sequence injected into embryos. The results suggest that YY1 is essential for Xenopus development; is necessary for neural ectoderm differentiation, a prerequisite for neural crest specification; and restricts which cells can form neural crest mesenchyme through directly blocking slug gene activity."
https://openalex.org/W2081593330,"The basic motif-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor NRL controls the expression of rhodopsin and other phototransduction genes and is a key mediator of photoreceptor differentiation. To delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional initiation of rod-specific genes, we characterized different regions of the NRL protein using yeast-based autoactivation assays. We identified 35 amino acid residues in the proline- and serine-rich N-terminal region (called minimal transactivation domain, MTD), which, when combined with LexA or Gal4 DNA binding domains, exhibited activation of target promoters. Because this domain is conserved in all proteins of the large Maf family, we hypothesized that NRL-MTD played an important role in assembling the transcription initiation complex. Our studies showed that the NRL protein, including the MTD, interacted with full-length or the C-terminal domain of TATA-binding protein (TBP) in vitro. NRL and TBP could be co-immunoprecipitated from bovine retinal nuclear extract. TBP was also part of c-Maf and MafA (two other large Maf proteins)-containing complex(es) in vivo. Our data suggest that the function of NRL-MTD is to activate transcription by recruiting or stabilizing TBP (and consequently other components of the general transcription complex) at the promoter of target genes, and a similar function may be attributed to other bZIP proteins of the large Maf family.

Initiation of transcription is a major target for genetic regulation of diverse biological processes, such as development and homeostasis (1Roeder R.G. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation is mediated by interactions among a plethora of proteins, which include chromatin-modifying proteins, activators, repressors, TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; CRX, cone-rod homeobox; DBD, DNA binding domain; MTD, minimal transactivation domain; NRL, neural retina leucine zipper; RNE, retinal nuclear extract; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside; WT, wild type; CT, C-terminal; NT, N-terminal; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.-associated factors, and basal transcription factors (2Lee T.I. Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 77-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Chromatin-modifying proteins and transcriptional activators bind to the promoter and form a DNA·protein complex, termed “enhanceosome” (3Merika M. Thanos D. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Basal transcription factors, either pre-assembled with RNA polymerase II or in a stepwise manner, bind to the enhanceosome to produce the pre-initiation complex (5Cosma M.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The basal transcription factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH) generally include a complex of proteins; of these, TFIID contains the TATA box-binding protein, TBP (6Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Once a stable pre-initiation complex is formed, the gene transcription is initiated. Tissue- or cell-type-specific expression of genes is regulated, to a large extent, by transcription factors that can act either as activators or repressors (7Latchman D.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 211-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Transcription factors are modular proteins and typically contain a DNA binding domain (DBD) and at least one transactivation domain (8Latchman D.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). At least twelve different DBDs and three types of activation domains have been described in mammalian systems (9He X.

Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The bZIP family of transcription factors contains a motif rich in basic amino acid residues that bind to DNA and a leucine zipper domain that is involved in homo- or heterodimerization (11Busch S.J. Sassone-Corsi P. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 36-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The Maf proteins constitute a subfamily within bZIP proteins and are important mediators of gene regulation in diverse cell types (12Blank V. Andrews N.C. Trends Biochem.

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 294: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The small Maf proteins (MafF, MafG, and MafK) lack a transactivation domain and can form heterodimers with cap ‘n’ collar (CNC) or Bach family proteins. In contrast, large Maf proteins (c-Maf, MafB, MafA or L-Maf, and NRL) have a larger N-terminal region that acts as a transactivation domain; c-Maf and MafB are widely expressed, whereas MafA and NRL exhibit restricted expression in different parts of the eye (12Blank V.

Although the function of DBDs has been investigated in great depth, the transactivation domains of transcription factors are less well characterized. To better understand the biochemical mechanism(s) underlying rod-specific gene regulation, we are interested in dissecting the role of distinct domains of NRL and evaluate their interactions with other proteins of the transcriptional machinery. To date, the transactivation domain of NRL has been broadly defined as a proline- and serine-rich region upstream of the C-terminal bZIP domain (20Rehemtulla A. Warwar R. Kumar R. Ji X. Zack D.J. Swaroop A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Here, we report that a proline- and serine-rich 35-amino acid domain in the N-terminal region of NRL is sufficient for transactivation of target promoters. We show that the region, including this minimal transactivation domain (MTD), can interact with TBP in vitro and that NRL and TBP are part of the same protein complex in vivo. We demonstrate that TBP is also part of multiprotein complexes containing two other large Maf proteins, c-Maf and MafA, in vivo. Our results suggest that NRL-MTD recruits or stabilizes the basal transcription factors to rod-specific promoters. NRL Constructs—Primers with EcoRI or NotI restriction sites were designed to amplify and generate NRL deletions D1–D11 and internal NRL fragments (Table I) using the human NRL cDNA template. PCR was performed with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with the addition of 1.7 m betaine and 4.8% Me2SO. The products were size-separated on agarose gels, purified using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and ligated into the pcDNA4c vector (Invitrogen). All cloned DNA fragments were completely sequence-verified. NRL inserts were subsequently purified and ligated into predigested (EcoRI/NotI) pHybLexZeo vector (Invitrogen). Inserts from the pHybLexZeo constructs containing wild type (WT) NRL, DD10, region 30–93, and region 40–74 were purified after digestion with EcoRI/SalI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and ligated to the pGBKT7 vector (BD Biosciences). NRL-Δ30–74 was generated from pcDNA4c WT-NRL using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and was sequence-verified.

Yeast transformations were performed as described (31Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr.

Individual colonies were then examined for autoactivation. Autoactivation/β-Galactosidase Tests—Colonies were patched onto an appropriate selection plate (-His, +20 μg/ml Zeocin, +50 mm 3-aminotriazole for pHybLexZeo constructs and -Trp plates for the pGBKT7 constructs) with and without 250 μl of 50 mg/ml X-gal, previously spread over the plate. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–7 days. Yeast patches on plates containing X-gal were analyzed for color change to blue, thereby showing autoactivation of the lacZ reporter. Patches on plates without X-gal were examined using a β-galactosidase filter lift assay, as described in the Hybrid Hunter Manual (Invitrogen). β-Galactosidase liquid assays were performed as described (32Montano M.M. MacDonald P.N. Methods in Molecular Biology, Two-Hybrid Systems: Methods and Protocols. 177. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 99-106Google Scholar). Briefly, one yeast colony from each construct was grown in 10 ml of YPDA culture overnight. Triplicate dilutions of cultures were made at an A600 of 0.25 in 2 ml of YPDA plus Zeocin (except L40 control, where only YPDA was used), prior to growth to log phase. A600 of aliquots of each culture were measured after 3 h growth at 30 °C. Cells were quickly centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the cell pellets were each resuspended in 500 μl of Z-buffer (32Montano M.M. MacDonald P.N. Methods in Molecular Biology, Two-Hybrid Systems: Methods and Protocols. 177. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 99-106Google Scholar). Each sample was subsequently treated to three freeze thaw cycles and then incubated at 30 °C after the addition of O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside-Z buffer until faint yellow or until 3–4 h had elapsed. The reactions were stopped using 1 m Na2CO3, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. A420 and A550 of each supernatant was then measured, and β-galactosidase units were determined as previously described (32Montano M.M. MacDonald P.N. Methods in Molecular Biology, Two-Hybrid Systems: Methods and Protocols. 177. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 99-106Google Scholar). At least three yeast colonies in triplicate, a total of nine samples, were examined per transformed construct. In Vitro Transcription/Translation and Co-immunoprecipitation— The protein was generated from various constructs using the Quick Coupled TnT-T7 rabbit reticulocyte translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) with non-radioactive or 35S-labeled methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Protein extracts (as indicated for a specific experiment) were co-incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of phosphate-buffered saline and protease inhibitors using protein A- or G-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography (22Mitton K.P. Swain P.K. Chen S. Xu S. Zack D.J. Swaroop A. J.

At the end of incubation, protein-A- or protein-G-agarose beads were added to precipitate the complex. The beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. The protein was suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using the appropriate antibodies (24Mitton K.P. Swain P.K. Khanna H. Dowd M. Apel I.J. Swaroop A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Homology Modeling of NRL-TBP Interaction—The crystal structure of the transcription factor IIIB core interface complex consisting of TBP, TFIIB-related factor (Brf1), and DNA (RCSB PDB 1NGM) was used as the template for the NRL-TBP interaction model (33Juo Z.S. Kassavetis G.A. Wang J. Geiduschek E.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Brf1 served as the template for the transactivation domain of NRL. The homology models were calculated using Modeller (34Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar). The input sequence alignment was manually adjusted to optimize the sequence similarity and overlap with the transactivation domain. Identification of NRL Domains Capable of Transactivation, Using Yeast Autoactivation Assays—NRL bait constructs that include LexA or Gal4 DNA binding domains would be capable of binding to the promoter of an auxotrophic and/or LacZ marker in an appropriate yeast strain. If a protein fragment contained a transactivation domain, it would be expected to autoactivate and turn on the appropriate reporter genes in yeast, as illustrated earlier (35Warnmark A. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15014-15018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Bouche N. Scharlat A. Snedden W. Bouchez D. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21851-21861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We had previously shown that full-length NRL activated rhodopsin promoter, whereas DD10, a naturally occurring variant of NRL that lacked most of the proline- and serine-rich region, did not (20Rehemtulla A. Warwar R. Kumar R. Ji X. Zack D.J. Swaroop A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Initially, bait constructs with different regions of NRL were generated with LexA DBD and examined by yeast autoactivation assay using WT and DD10 as positive and negative controls, respectively (Fig. 1). L40 yeast patches on a plate with X-gal showed autoactivation with construct D1 (amino acids 30–237). The removal of N-terminal 74 amino acids (construct D2) dramatically reduced the reporter gene activity. Filter lift assays, a more sensitive test of β-galactosidase activity, demonstrated that the D2 construct (residues 75–237) did reveal β-galactosidase activity. The reduction in transactivation was confirmed by yeast liquid assays (Fig. 1). N-terminal deletions beyond amino acids 75 (D3, D4, and D5) resulted in the elimination of autoactivation capability, as determined by the three β-galactosidase assays. NRL-D6, encoding only residues 1–57, completely lacked transactivation activity, whereas internal fragments containing amino acids 30–93 (D7, D8, and D9) were able to activate the reporter genes. Notably, D7 (amino acids 1–123) and D9 (amino acids 30–93) constructs had substantially higher levels of autoactivation than wild type NRL. On the contrary, D8 (amino acids 30–143) with 50 additional amino acids compared with D9, showed greatly reduced levels of autoactivation. These results suggest that the residues from 75 to 143 may have additional domains that can affect the degree of NRL transactivation. Constructs D10 (amino acids 88–143) and D11 (amino acids 122–181) did not show autoactivation. Hence, the transactivation ability of NRL was primarily contained within the residues 30–93. To define the minimal transactivation domain (MTD), we examined additional constructs. NRL regions 30–74 and 40–74 showed transactivation activity close to the wild type NRL levels (Fig. 2A). The constructs with NRL region 30–64 and with the region 58–74 did not exhibit any activation of reporter genes in yeast assays. In addition, we made constructs with NRL regions 75–93 and 75–102 to map the residual activity observed in D2 (amino acids 75–237); however, neither showed autoactivation. These data suggest that the domain responsible for the residual activity was either after amino acid 102 or was included in 75–102 but was disrupted and non-functional. To establish that the primary region responsible for transactivation was contained within amino acids 30–74, we generated an in-frame deletion variant of NRL removing amino acids 30–74. This construct, NRL-Δ30–74, gave filter lift and liquid assay results similar to D2, confirming that the domain from residues 30–74 includes the major domain involved in the transactivation function of NRL. NRL-MTD Can Function with the Gal4 DNA Binding Do main—Because the NRL region from residues 40–74 (hereafter called NRL-MTD) was sufficient for transactivation with LexA DBD, we examined whether it can function with another DNA binding domain. We transferred several NRL inserts into the pGBKT7 vector, which contains the Gal4 DNA binding domain, and examined their activity in Y187 yeast. The β-galactosidase activity of these constructs could not be observed on X-gal-containing -Trp plates (data not shown), suggesting that the level of transactivation of the LacZ reporter in Y187 yeast is not as strong as in L40 yeast. Nevertheless, the filter lift assay showed autoactivation by full-length NRL, NRL 30–93, and NRL 40–74, whereas weaker activity was detected with NRL-Δ30–74 (Fig. 3). NRL-MTD Is Conserved in Other Large Maf Proteins—To examine whether NRL-MTD exhibits similarity to the putative transactivation domains in other Maf proteins, we performed homology searches. A ClustalW alignment of NRL-MTD with c-MAF, MAFA, and MAFB (three large Maf proteins) showed a high degree of similarity, particularly for the conservation of serine and proline residues (Fig. 4). NRL and TBP Can Interact in Vitro—The high degree of sequence conservation suggested that the MTD of NRL (and of other large Maf proteins) must have an important fundamental function. We therefore examined whether NRL-MTD can interact with components of the basal transcriptional machinery. In the rhodopsin promoter, the NRL-response element (NRE) is close to the TATA-box (22Mitton K.P. Swain P.K. Chen S. Xu S. Zack D.J. Swaroop A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29794-29799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Assays involving in vitro transcription/translation followed by immunoprecipitation were first performed to test the interaction of different NRL regions with TBP (Fig. 5). Full-length TBP could be co-immunoprecipitated with full-length NRL or with NRL amino acids 30–93 using anti-Xpress tag antibody (Fig. 5A). The NRL regions from 30–74 or 40–74 were not tested, because a sufficient amount of protein could not be produced for the assay (data not shown). We examined the N-terminal (amino acids 1–161, containing the polyglutamine domain; TBP-NT) and the C-terminal (amino acids 162–339, TBP-CT) regions of TBP for their interaction with NRL (Fig. 5B). Our results show that TBP-CT could be co-immunoprecipitated with NRL by the anti-NRL antibody, whereas TBP-NT was not. As expected, anti-Xpress tag antibody and anti-TBP antibody did not immunoprecipitate TBP and NRL, respectively (Fig. 5A). NRL and TBP Can Interact in Vivo—To validate the in vivo significance of NRL-TBP interaction, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using the bovine RNE with anti-NRL or anti-TBP antibodies. Immunoblot analysis of the RNE immunoprecipitate obtained with the anti-NRL antibody showed a band of expected size with anti-TBP antibody (Fig. 6A). In the reverse experiment, the RNE immunoprecipitate with anti-TBP antibody revealed the expected NRL bands (29–35 kDa) upon immunoblotting. These results clearly show that NRL and TBP are present in the same complex in retinal nuclear extracts. TBP Interacts with Other Large Maf Proteins in Vivo—Because the MTD of NRL has a high degree of homology with other large Maf proteins, we wanted to determine if they could also interact with TBP in vivo. Hence, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using bovine kidney and mouse pancreatic protein extracts with anti-c-maf and anti-MafA antibodies, respectively. Immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitates using anti-TBP antibody showed a band of the expected size (Fig. 6, C and D). TBP was not immunoprecipitated in the absence of primary antibody. The large Maf protein MafB could not be tested for its interaction with TBP, because a sufficient amount of MafB protein was not detected in tissues that were examined. NRL May Interact with TBP in an Extended Conformation—A manual sequence alignment based upon the Brf1-TBP x-ray structure (33Juo Z.S. Kassavetis G.A. Wang J. Geiduschek E.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was performed, and a homology model was calculated (Fig. 7). The model yields a structurally sensible homology model and displays plausible chemical interactions. Due to the low sequence similarity (12.5% identity) and the extended conformation of the Brf1 template structure, the relative positioning of the NRL-Brf1 sequence alignment may differ in detail from the model in vivo. However, we believe the functional implications of this model are strongly supported by the Brf1-TBP x-ray structure, the functional data with NRL, and the sequence similarity between Brf1 and NRL. The homology model is consistent with the predicted electrostatic interactions between TBP and NRL, similar to TBP-Brf1 interactions seen in the experimental structure (33Juo Z.S. Kassavetis G.A. Wang J. Geiduschek E.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Positively charged residues Arg-107, Lys-133, Arg-137, Lys-138, Arg-141, and Lys-151 are presumed to interact with a subset of predicted phosphoserine residues Ser-38, Ser-46, Ser-50, and Ser-54 (Fig. 7). In the model, Ser-50 and Ser-54 are located in the positively c"
https://openalex.org/W2071994689,"Prostate cancer is a very common disease in industrialized countries and it is known to be androgen-dependent. The human SRD5A2 gene encodes the prostatic (or type II) steroid 5α-reductase, which catalyses the irreversible conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most active androgen in the prostate. We have sequenced the entire protein-coding region of this locus in 30 microdissected prostate adenocarcinomas. We identified a total of 17 de novo amino-acid substitutions in 13 of these tumors. We also identified six additional silent substitutions. In total, 18 out of 30 (60%) of the tumors examined had de novo somatic substitutions in the prostatic steroid 5α-reductase-coding region. We also characterized all of the SRD5A2 missense substitutions biochemically and pharmacologically, using three 5α-reductase inhibitors, including finasteride. The biochemical parameters of the distinct 5α-reductase missense substitutions varied substantially. We note that two out of the three recurrent SRD5A2 missense substitutions increased 5α-reductase in vitro activity, while the third one is essentially neutral. These findings are consistent with a role for increased DHT levels in the prostate through increased activity of the SRD5A2 locus in prostate cancer progression, in a subset of patients. Our pharmacologic studies also reveal substantial variability for each 5α-reductase inhibitor. These data, therefore, should be taken into account in both prevention as well as therapeutic trials of prostate cancer utilizing 5α-reductase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2009157867,"Thyroid cancers, like hematological malignancies, are commonly associated with chromosomal translocations leading to the formation of fusion proteins. Through altered signaling by fusion proteins, cell death and survival pathways are disrupted and the physiological balance of cell-cell communication may be lost. A consequence of this disruption is the release of factors by stressed cells that alert the host. One type of host response is leukocytic infiltration that may develop into chronic inflammation or autoimmune disease. Although inflammation can be associated with neoplastic tissue, the mechanism driving this process is largely unknown. Therefore, to address the mechanism of cancer inflammation we investigated the effects of an oncogene in a murine model system. A comprehensive genetic analysis revealed several soluble factors that were induced by RET/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)3 gene expression including several proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and immunologically relevant costimulatory molecules. Following a large genetic screen using RP3-expressing thyroid cells, we identified a highly abundant transcript and later identified it as interleukin 24 (Il24), a cytokine with diverse tumor suppressor and inflammatory activities. We show that RET/PTC3 induces Il24 expression in rat thyrocytes and that this expression is dependent on the signaling properties of its tyrosine kinase. Likewise, RET/PTC3 induces large amounts of Il24 following expression in murine thyrocytes, but its expression is dramatically reduced in poorly differentiated carcinomas, a finding that parallels the loss of RET/PTC3 expression. Consistent with its behavior as a tumor suppressor, the loss of Il24 coincided with the loss of RET/PTC3 in poorly differentiated mouse tumors. A functional role of Il24 in the autocrine growth/survival of RET/PTC3-expressing thyroid cells was identified helping to support its role in cellular transformation. These data suggest that the induction of Il24 by oncogenes may support tumor growth at the early stages of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1967603160,"The receptor tyrosine kinase RET is alternatively spliced to yield two main isoforms, RET9 and RET51, which differ in their carboxyl terminal. Activated RET induces different biological responses such as morphological transformation, neurite outgrowth, proliferation, cell migration and branching. The two isoforms have been suggested to have separate intracellular signaling pathways and different roles in mouse development. Here we show that both isoforms are able to induce cell scattering of SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cell line and branching tubule formation in MDCK cell line. However, the Y1062F mutation, which abrogates the transforming activity of both activated RET isoforms in NIH3T3 cells, does not abolish scattering and branching morphogenesis of RET51, whereas impairs these biological effects of RET9. The GDNF-induced biological effects of RET51 are inhibited by the simultaneous abrogation of both Tyr1062 and Tyr1096 docking sites. Thus, Tyr1096 may substitute the functions of Tyr1062. GRB2 is the only known adaptor protein binding to Tyr1096. Dominant-negative GRB2 expressed in MDCK cells together with RET9 or RET51 significantly reduces branching. Therefore, GRB2 is necessary for RET-mediated branching of MDCK cells."
https://openalex.org/W1995662781,"Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory cytokine synthesized as a 24 kDa inactive precursor (pro-IL-18) by several cell types, and is processed to a bioactive molecule of 18 kDa by the proteinases caspase-1 or caspase-4. All ovarian carcinoma cell lines express pro-IL-18, only in some instances coexpress caspase-1, and always express caspase-4; in any case, they display a defective processing of IL-18. We analysed whether pro-IL-18, present in two ovarian carcinoma cell lysates, could be processed ‘in vitro’ by recombinant active caspase-1. While most of pro-IL-18 could be cleaved by caspase-1, a residual of pro-IL-18 appeared to be resistant. Cloning and sequence analysis of the whole pro-IL-18 open reading frame demonstrated the existence of an alternatively spliced mRNA variant, which lacked exon-3 (Δ3pro-IL-18). The 12 bp exon-3 encodes for the AEDD amino-acid sequence, which is N-terminal with respect to the cleavage site of caspase-1. Both pro-IL-18 and Δ3pro-IL-18 mRNA isoforms were detected in all ovarian cancer cell lines analysed, while Δ3pro-IL-18 mRNA was undetectable in normal ovarian epithelial cells. The Δ3pro-IL-18 cDNA induced synthesis of an alternative Δ3pro-IL-18 protein upon transfection into a murine cell line. The Δ3pro-IL-18 protein was resistant to proteolytic activation by caspase-1 and -4, although it was capable to bind caspase-1. Aternative splicing of pro-IL-18 exon-3 may represent a novel mechanism of regulation of bioactive IL-18 production in human ovarian tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2040182517,"Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) is a ubiquitous enzyme with an essential role in antioxidant defense. To better understand structural factors at the origin of the highly efficient superoxide dismutation mechanism, we analyzed the consequence of copper reduction on the electronic properties of the backbone and individual amino acids by using electrochemistry coupled to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Comparison of data recorded with bovine erythrocyte and recombinant chloroplastic Cu,Zn-SOD from Lycopersicon esculentum, expressed as a functional tetramer in Escherichia coli and 14N- or fully 15N-labeled, demonstrated that the infrared changes were dominated by reorganizations of peptide bonds and histidine copper ligands. Two main infrared modes of histidine side chain, markers of metal coordination, were identified by using Cu- and Zn-methylimidazole models: the ν(C4C5)at 1605-1594 cm-1 or ≈1586 cm-1 for Nτ or Nπ coordination, and the ν(C5Nτ) at ≈1113-1088 cm-1. These modes, also identified in Cu,Zn-SOD by using 15N labeling, showed that the electronic properties of the histidine Nτ ligands of copper are mostly affected upon copper reduction. A striking conclusion of this work is that peptide groups from loops and β-sheet largely participate in charge redistribution upon copper reduction, and in contrast, electronic properties of polar and charged amino acids of the superoxide access channel remain unaffected. This is notably shown for the strictly conserved Arg-143 by site-directed mutagenesis on chloroplastic Cu,Zn-SOD. Charge compensation by the peptide backbone and preserved electronic properties of the superoxide access channel and docking site upon copper reduction may be the determinant factors for the high reaction kinetics of superoxide with both reduced and oxidized Cu,Zn-SOD.

Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), in agreement with other spectroscopic data. This rupture of the Cu-His-61 bond upon copper reduction was the basis of the generally accepted reaction mechanism of Tainer et al. (35Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nature. 1983; 306: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), in which His-61 provides one of the protons necessary for superoxide reduction into hydrogen peroxide at Cu(I). Indeed, NMR data paralleled the loss of Cu,Zn-SOD activity at high pH with His-61 deprotonation (36Banci L. Bertini I. Luchinat C. Viezzoli M.S. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 1403-1406Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Also, coordination of His-61 to zinc would determine the large pH independence of Cu,Zn-SOD activity (37Ellerby L.M. Cabelli D.E. Graden J.A. Valentine J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6556-6561Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Binding of superoxide as a ligand of Cu(II) and Cu(I) is under debate, as are the inner or outer sphere electron transfer mechanism for the reduction (oxidation) of superoxide (35Tainer J.A.

Experimental data thus demonstrated a crucial role for Arg-141 and for charged and polar residues building an electrostatic field in the superoxide access channel for the efficient function of Cu,Zn-SOD (18Beyer Jr., W.F.

Because this electrostatic field was predicted from calculations to be contributed to not only by charged side chains but also by the copper and polypeptide backbone (42Marino M. Galvano M. Cambria A. Polticelli F. Desiredi A. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we decided to monitor directly the changes in electronic properties of highly conserved amino acids and of peptide bonds upon copper reduction using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A former study comparing second derivatives of infrared absorption spectra of oxidized or reduced Cu,Zn-SOD concluded that conformational changes occur at the level of loop and β-sheet structures upon copper reduction (43Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this work, we used electrochemically induced FTIR difference spectroscopy (for reviews on the technique, see Refs. 44Mäntele W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 197-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar and 45Zscherp C. Barth A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) to detect on the same sample minute perturbations of the electronic properties or hydrogen bonding interactions of both amino acid side chains and of the polypeptide backbone. We analyzed the redox-induced infrared changes detected on dimeric bovine erythrocyte (BeSOD) and tetrameric chloroplastic (ChSOD) Cu,Zn-SOD of Lycopersicon esculentum, which differ at the level of charged and polar residues of the superoxide access channel (3Bertini I.

Biol. 1988; 11: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recombinant ChSOD was expressed in Escherichia coli and 15N-labeled to assign with confidence the vibrational modes from histidine copper ligands, peptide groups, or conserved amino acid side chains. Site-directed mutations at the strictly conserved Arg-143 and Thr-137 (plant numbering), located in the superoxide access channel, were performed to define their contributions to the electrostatic field reorganization upon copper reduction in ChSOD. Samples Preparation—BeSOD was purchased from Sigma. Gel electrophoresis on different batches of samples showed that the commercial preparation was sufficiently pure and could be used directly for the FTIR spectroscopic studies (supplemental Fig. 1A). The BeSOD concentration was estimated by absorbance at 680 nm using ϵ680 = 300 m-1 cm-1, and the specific activity was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the inhibition by BeSOD of cytochrome c reduction by xanthine oxidase as described previously (47McCord J.M. Maines M.D. Current Protocols in Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 7.3.1.-77.3.9Google Scholar). The BeSOD samples had specific activities of ≈3000 units/mg. Samples were concentrated to 2 mm either in 50 mm Tris/HBr, pH 7.6, or in 50 mm Ches, pH 9.3. Except as otherwise mentioned, all electrochemical experiments were performed in the presence of 100 mm KBr as supporting electrolyte. For 1H2O/2H2O exchange, the buffers in H2O were dried using a speed vacuum system and dissolved in 2H2O two times subsequently. The concentrated protein solution in 1H2O (10 μl) was diluted in 400 μl of deuterated buffer, maintained for 2 h at room temperature and concentrated to ≈10 μl using a Microcon 10 (Millipore) system. This sample was diluted again in 400 μl of deuterated buffer, incubated for 2 weeks at 10 °C for extensive 1H/2H exchange, and washed again by concentration/dilution steps in 2H2O buffer before analysis by FTIR spectroscopy. Expression of Chloroplastic Cu,Zn-SOD—The cDNA gene of ChSOD from L. esculentum was kindly provided by Dr. Perl-Treves (46Perl-Treves R. Nacmias B. Aviv D. Zeelon E.P. Galun E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) on the pGEM2 plasmid (Promega). A pair of restriction enzyme sites (NdeI at the 5′ end and BamHI at the 3′ end, boldface letters) were incorporated flanking the cDNA gene of ChSOD by PCR amplification using the oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GTCCAGTTCATATGGCTACTAAGAAAGCTGTTG-3′ and 5′-ATCTGGATCCTCA-TATTGGAGTCAAACCAACCACA-3′. The 480-bp PCR-amplified fragment was purified, digested by NdeI and BamHI, and cloned into the NdeI/BamHI-digested pet11-a expression plasmid from Stratagene (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by using the E. coli strain DH5α. The resulting plasmid pChSOD-1 was used to transform E. coli BL21 pLys DE3 strain, allowing IPTG-induced expression of the recombinant ChSOD. All digestions, ligations, transformations, and other manipulations were performed by using standard protocols (48Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA sequence was verified by sequencing. The pChSOD-1 transformed E. coli BL21 pLys DE3 cells were grown in minimal M9 medium in the presence of thiamin, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol at 10, 100, and 25 μg/ml, respectively. Induction was triggered by the addition of IPTG at 1 mm/liter when the cultures reached an absorbance (A600) of 0.5. The cells were harvested 4 h after induction. For the production of uniformly 15N-labeled ChSOD, the same supplemented M9 medium was used except that 15N-labeled ammonium chloride (1 g/liter) was used as an exclusive nitrogen source. Both overnight culture and cultures in a 50-ml Erlenmeyer flask used to inoculate the 1-liter flasks were performed with the fully 15N-labeled M9 medium. The extent of 15N labeling of the ChSOD was controlled by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectroscopy. Simultaneous injection of 14N- and 15N-labeled ChSOD showed a mass difference of 200 Da between the 14N- and 15N-labeled ChSOD, which agreed with a fully 15N-labeled protein (supplemental Fig. 2). Site-directed Mutagenesis of ChSOD—The site-directed mutants were obtained by two steps of PCR using the oligonucleotides 1 and 2 described previously and the following oligonucleotides 3 and 4 including the mutation (boldface letters) 5′-ATGCTGGTGGACAATTGGCATGC-3′ and 5′-GCATGCCAATTGTCCACCAGCAT-3′ for the Arg-143 → Gln mutant and 5′-CAGTCTTACCCAAGGCAATGCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGCATTGCCTTGGGTAAGACTG-3′ for the Thr-137 → Gln mutant. For each mutant, in a first step, two PCR were performed with oligonucleotides 1 and 4 and with oligonucleotides 2 and 3. The PCR products from this first step were purified, mixed at a 1 to 1 ratio, and used to perform the second PCR step to amplify the whole gene using the initial oligonucleotides 1 and 2. ChSOD Purification—Typically, the cells from 8 liters of culture were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 7,000 × g. The cells suspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mm KCl were passed twice through a French press (at 14 MPa). The suspension of soluble proteins was obtained after centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to discard unbroken cells and membranes. This cell-free extract was loaded onto a DEAE column (80 ml) equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mm KCl. The column was developed using a rapid KCl gradient from 8 to 200 mm. The ChSOD-containing fractions were selected by using a rapid liquid test, based on the SOD inhibition of light-induced riboflavin reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium in the presence of the electron donor methionine. The ChSOD fractions were pooled and applied in six independent runs to a Resource column (6 ml) (Amersham Biosciences). The active enzyme was eluted with (14-16 volumes of column) 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mm KCl. The specific activity of this fraction was determined at 3300 units/mg, using the xanthine oxidase/xanthine/cytochrome c method described previously (47McCord J.M. Maines M.D. Current Protocols in Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 7.3.1.-77.3.9Google Scholar). Protein gel electrophoresis in denaturing conditions showed that the ChSOD fractions obtained after the two-step purification procedure contained only modest contributions from contaminant proteins at 40 and 28 kDa (Supplemental Fig. 1B). The gel electrophoresis performed in nondenaturing conditions showed the main band at ≈60 kDa indicating that the tetrameric form of ChSOD could be preserved throughout the purification procedure. By using this purification procedure and expression in minimal medium, 1.75 mg of tetrameric ChSOD was obtained per culture liter. Spectra of Model Compounds—FTIR spectra were recorded with solutions of methylimidazole (MeIm) and CuCl2 with MeIm to copper ratios ranging from 1 to 20. Upon increasing concentration of CuCl2, the IR modes of MeIm in solution were substituted by IR modes characteristic of MeIm bound to copper. These signals were maximized with a copper to MeIm ratio of 1 to 4. Thus, the FTIR spectra of Cu(II) and Zn(II)-MeIm complexes were recorded in solution at pH 8 with methylimidazole to CuCl2 or ZnCl2 at metal to MeIm ratio of 1 to 4. Sample Preparation for FTIR Spectroscopy—For spectro-electrochemistry, the Cu,Zn-SOD concentration was between 0.8 and 2 mm. Electrochemistry was performed in the optical transparent thin layer electrochemical cell developed by Moss et al. (49Moss D. Nabedryk E. Breton J. Mäntele W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), using a 4-μm-thick gold mesh as working electrode (Buckbee Mears). The working electrode was surface-modified by dipping it for 5 min in a 5 mm pyridine-3-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (PATS-3, purchased from Lancaster Synthesis) solution heated to 80-90 °C. Excess PATS-3 was thoroughly removed with 18 megohms Millipore water, and the gold grid was dried on a CaF2 window. PATS-3 binds irreversibly to the gold surface through the sulfur atom and interacts with the proteins in solution through the pyridine and amine groups (50Hill H.A.O. Page D.J. Walton N.J. Whitford D. Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry. 1985; 187: 315-324Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The reference electrode consisted in an Ag/AgCl/KCl (3 m) system (Em = 208 mV/NHE). Thereafter, all redox potentials are given versus normal hydrogen electrode. A platinum counter electrode at the periphery of the cell was used to compensate for the potential drop caused by current. Electrochemistry was performed at 4 °C (6 °C in 2H2O) in the presence of the electrochemical mediators ferricyanide (Em = 430 mV), 1,4-p-benzoquinone (Em = 280 mV), 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (Em = 217 mV), methylviologen (Em = -440 mV), each at 100-300 μm final concentration. Several of the usually used redox mediators are not efficient for Cu,Zn-SOD reduction (oxidation) because the copper site is deeply buried in the protein. We selected only mediators that were shown to accelerate Cu,Zn-SOD reduction (oxidation) (51Lawrence G.D. Sawyer D.T. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3045-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The potential was applied to the electrochemical cell using an EG&G (model 362) potentiostat, triggered by the FTIR spectrometer. The redox titration of the Cu,Zn-SOD copper center was performed by monitoring the potential-dependent UV-visible absorption spectra, using the same electrochemical cell and conditions as for FTIR. UV-visible spectra were recorded with a Varian Cary 5"

In cell-attached and excised apical membrane patches, we found an inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir). The permeability ratio was PNa/PK = 0.058. In 30 patches with both cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and Kir present, we observed 79 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and 58 Kir channels. The average chord conductance was 24.4 ± 0.5 pS (n = 11), between 0 and –200 mV, and was 9.6 ± 0.7 pS (n = 8), between 0 and 50 mV; these magnitudes and their ratio of ∼2.5 are most similar to values for rectifying K+ channels of the Kir4.x subfamilies. We attempted to amplify transcripts for Kir4.1, Kir4.2, and Kir5.1; of these only Kir4.2 was present in Calu-3 lysates. The channel was only weakly activated by ATP and was relatively insensitive to internal pH. External Cs+ and Ba2+ blocked the channel with Kd values in the millimolar range. Quantitative modeling of Cl– secreting epithelia suggests that secretion rates will be highest and luminal K+ will rise to 16–28 mm if 11–25% of the total cellular K+ conductance is placed in the apical membrane (Cook, D. I., and Young, J. A. (1989) J. Membr. Biol. 110, 139–146). Thus, we hypothesize that the K+ channel described here optimizes the rate of secretion and is involved in K+ recycling for the recently proposed apical H+-K+-ATPase in Calu-3 cells.

Finkbeiner W.E. Wine J.J. Mrsny R.J. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L493-L501PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to expressing many typical serous cell markers (7Finkbeiner W.E. Carrier S.D. Teresi C.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), Calu-3 cells are of special interest because they produce two kinds of anion secretion depending upon the mode of stimulation. When activated via agents that elevate [cAMP]i, Calu-3 cells secrete a HCO–3-rich fluid, whereas if activated by agents that elevate [Ca2+]i they secrete a Cl–-rich fluid (5Devor D.C. Singh A.K.

It has now been shown directly that anion secretion from Calu-3 cells drives the robust secretion of fluid at rates up to 10 μl/cm2/h (10Irokawa T. Krouse M.E. Joo N.S. Wu J.V. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2004; 287: L784-L793Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Recently, it was shown that apically secreted HCO–3 is partially neutralized by proton secretion under some conditions (8Krouse M.E. Talbott J.F. Lee M.M. Joo N.S. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287 (in press)Google Scholar). The source of the protons appears to be an H+-K+-ATPase because it is ouabain-sensitive and requires apical K+ (8Krouse M.E. Talbott J.F. Lee M.M. Joo N.S. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287 (in press)Google Scholar). This raises the issue of the source of the apical K+. An apical K+ channel in Calu-3 cells is suggested by results of Cowley and Linsdell (6Cowley E.A. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), who showed that 16% of the Isc under basal conditions could be blocked with apical Ba2+, but nothing else is known about the properties of the putative apical K+ channels.In the present experiments, patch clamp methods and RT-PCR were used to characterize apical K+ channels in the apical membranes of polarized Calu-3 cells. In excised apical membrane patches, we found abundant copies of a single type of inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir). The Kir family of channels (reviewed in Ref. 11Bichet D. Haass F.A. Jan L.Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) are homo- or heterotetramers. Each subunit has two transmembrane domains, a pore loop, and cytoplasmic N and C termini. At least 16 genes (KCNJ1–16) have been identified, giving rise to channels grouped into 7 subfamilies that differ in their channel signatures, distribution, and mode of activation. Kir channels differ from the previously identified basolateral K+ channels of Calu-3 cells, which are 6 transmembrane domain channels activated by elevations of [Ca2+]i and [cAMP]i, respectively. Transcripts for Kir4.2 were amplified in Calu-3 lysates, but the signature of the Calu-3 apical K+ channel did not exactly match previous descriptions of Kir4.2 channels, leaving its identity undetermined.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Cell Culture—Experiments were conducted using Calu-3 cells grown as previously described by Shen et al. (1Shen B.Q. Finkbeiner W.E. Wine J.J. Mrsny R.J. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L493-L501PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the Calu-3 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). After thawing, cells were grown at 37 °C in T25 tissue culture flasks (Costar, Pleasanton, CA) containing a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12, plus 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% O2. Cells were passaged at 1:8 dilution and plated at 5 × 105 cells/cm2 onto a 35-mm Petri dish coated with human placental collagen. Cells were grown to partially confluent islands and used after 1–7 days in culture. To ensure that recordings were made from apical membranes, we only include recordings from cells that were surrounded by other cells within the islands; cells located at edges of the islands were ignored.Patch Clamp Recording and Solutions—Cell attached and inside-out single channel patch clamp recordings were made at ∼23 °C. Pipettes were pulled from Prism LA16/SA16 Glass (Dagan Corp.) on a P-87 Brown-Flaming puller. Pipettes with smaller tips were pulled from thick wall glass (SA16 inner diameter = 0.75, outer diameter = 1.65 mm) and those with larger tips from thin wall glass (LA16 inner diameter = 1.10, outer diameter = 1.65 mm). The different tip sizes were used to record either single channels for kinetic analyses or multiple channels when averaged data was required. Currents were amplified and filtered at 500 Hz or 2 kHz with an Axopatch 1C amplifier. Data acquisition was controlled by pClamp 8.0 (Axon Instruments). Data were sampled and digitized at a rate of 5 kHz and stored on disk. Liquid junction potentials between patch pipette and bath solution were electrically nulled by adjusting the amplifier prior to making seals. Membrane voltage was held at –60 mV unless otherwise indicated.Pipettes were filled with a solution (in mm) of 150 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 2.5 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, with pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH, and osmolarity adjusted to 320 mosmol. The standard bath and cytosolic control solution was (in mm) 130 K-glutamate, 20 KCl, 0.5 EGTA, 2.5 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES titrated to pH 7.3 with KOH. Osmolarity was adjusted to 320–340 mosmol. The free calcium level was 500 μm as computed by MaxChelator (www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html). Buffer solutions were titrated with KOH to pH values of 7.3, 6.0, 6.7, or 8.0.Solution Changer—The valve-controlled solution changer consisted of a manifold with 4 inlet ports, each connected to a different solution reservoir, and one outlet port connected to a perfusion pipette. The manifold was located ∼2 mm from the tip of the perfusion pipette. Solutions were switched manually in less than 2 s. In this setup the patch and perfusion pipette have fixed positions, which assures identical access to each solution.Ussing Chamber Experiments—A small number of short-circuit (Isc) experiments were carried out with monolayers of Calu-3 cells grown for ∼4 weeks on Snapwell filters coated with human placental collagen. Cells were fed from the basolateral side and grown at the air interface. Inserts were mounted in an Ussing chamber (4 ml volume each chamber), the voltage was short circuited with a Physiologic Instrument VCC600, and the current was recorded on a computer using PCLab. Bicarbonate containing solutions were bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and held at 37 °C. A voltage pulse was passed across the monolayer every 20 s to measure monolayer resistance. After mounting the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with amphotericin B (100 μm) and the Isc across the remaining apical membrane was recorded in the presence of an 11:1 K+ gradient. The apical K+ conductance was probed with 5 mm Ba2+ added apically.Data Analysis—All-point amplitude histograms were constructed for selected traces to determine the amplitude of the unitary current. Histograms were least-squares fit with (N + 1) Gaussian functions (N, number of active channels in the patch; resolution N < 10). The resulting average peak-to-peak interval represented the unitary current (i). Po was determined through least-square fits of binomial distributions of the multiple Gaussians or by Po = I/iNT, where I is the integrated current and T is the total recording time. N was also determined by the peak current observed in a patch, divided by the unitary current obtained as above.The permeability ratio, PNa/PK, was estimated for the excised patches. The plot of reversal potential against [K+]o was fitted to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation, taking Er obtained with 150 mm K+ in the pipette as reference. This gave an estimate of PNa/PK. The relationship between Er and [K+]o was fitted with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, Er = (RT/F) ln [(PK[K+]o + PNa[Na+]o)/PK[K+]i] = (RT/F) ln [[K+]o/C + PNa/K (1-[K+]o/C)], where C = [K+]o + [Na+]o = [K+]i = 150 mm, and R, T, and F have their usual meanings.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from Calu-3 cells using the RNeasy® Mini extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the ribonuclease-free deoxyribonuclease step. Two-tube RT-PCR was performed using Sensiscript® reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) protocol and HotStarTaq® DNA polymerase (Qiagen) protocol. The Qiagen PCR protocol was scaled down from 100 to 40 μl. The final reaction mixture contained 1.5 mm Mg2+, 200 μm dNTP, and 0.4 μm concentrations of each primer. The primers used are described in Table I (12Dewson G. Conley E.C. Bradding P.

The amplification products were electrophoresed on a 1.4% agarose gel containing 0.02% ethidium bromide and photographed. In positive controls, the sets of primers for Kir4.1, Kir4.2, and Kir5.1 (i.e. genes KCNJ10, KCNJ15, and KCNJ16, respectively) yielded amplified products of the expected size.Statistics—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Statistical difference was determined by Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSFunctional K+Channels Expressed in the Apical Membrane—When cell-attached patches were formed on polarized Calu-3 cells using pipettes filled with 150 mm KCl, the most abundant channel activity observed was CFTR, which tended to mask other channel activity. However, immediately upon excision of inside-out patches into an ATP-free, 150 mm K-glutamate solution, K+ channel activity became apparent in ∼45% of patches made with smaller tipped (thick wall) pipettes and ∼100% of patches made with larger tipped (thin wall) pipettes. K+ channel activity was observed even when Ca2+ and Mg2+ levels in the bath were <100 nm. The relative numbers of cell-attached CFTR and excised Kir channels observed in two samples of patches made with thick wall pipettes is shown in Table II.Table IIChannel count statistics in patch clampKirCFTRPatches (n)169158Patches with channels (n)76 (45%)77 (49%)Channels (n)145221Channels per active patch (n)1.92.9 Open table in a new tab Each of these samples was made in conditions designed to optimize recording of Kir or CFTR, respectively. To establish more definitively that these two types of channel occur in the same apical membrane patch and to estimate their relative abundance, recordings were made under conditions in which each type of channel could be observed, and ramp voltages were used to isolate the two kinds of channel currents (Fig. 1, top trace). In 28 excised patches that had both channel types, we observed a total of 79 CFTR and 58 Kir channels. The mean ± S.D. number of channels was 2.8 ± 0.40 CFTR channels and 2.1 ± 0.25 Kir channels per patch, with a mean CFTR:Kir ratio of 1.8 ± 0.33.Unitary Conductance and Inward Rectification—In solutions containing symmetrical K+, unitary current traces at different membrane potentials revealed asymmetrical amplitudes characteristic of inward rectification (Figs. 1, lower trace, and 2A). The rectification was quantified in I–V curves taken from 8 to 11 patches (Fig. 2B). The average inward chord conductance taken between 0 and –200 mV was 24.4 ± 0.5 pS (n = 11) and the outward chord conductance taken between 0 and 50 mV was 9.6 ± 0.7 pS (n = 8). The magnitude of the unitary conductances and their rectification ratio of ∼2.5 are most similar to K+ channels of the Kir4.x family.Fig. 2Permeation properties of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir) in excised apical membrane patch of Calu-3 cells. A, raw unitary current traces recorded in inside-out patch at different membrane potentials. B, unitary I–V curve averaged from 8 to 11 patches, showing an inward rectification in symmetrical K+. The solid line represents a least-squares fit of 2nd order polynomial function. The mean inward chord conductance γi = 24.4 pS and the mean outward chord conductance γo = 9.6 pS. The S.E. was less than the size of the symbol for most points. Unitary I–V curves from three different levels of [K+]o were used to determine reversal potentials. C, the semi-logarithmic plot of relative Erversus [K+]o. The solid line is the least square fit by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation to get the permeability ratio, PNa/K = 0.058. Linear fit gives 48.3 mV shifts in Er per 10-fold change in [K+]o. D, [K+]o-dependent unitary conductance changes fitted with a power function of g ∼ [K+]n, n = 0.49. These channel properties are consistent with those of Kir4.2 reported elsewhere.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Selective K+Permeation—To determine permeation-selectivity between K+ and Na+, we recorded the single channel currents in the inside-out configuration with pipettes filled with different concentrations of K+ (substituted with Na+) to determine reversal potentials. Unitary I–V curves at three different [K+]o are shown in Fig. 2B. Each symbol represents the average from 4 to 11 patches ± S.E. At negative membrane potentials ≤–100 mV, the I–V curves for lower [K+]o are no longer linear, suggesting that [Na+]o blocks permeation. Low [K]o data were least squares fit with a 3rd order polynomial to extract reversal potentials from the linear portions. The relative reversal potentials (Er) with respect to that in symmetrical K+ were –56.1 and –17.1 mV at [K+]o of 10 and 50 mm KCl, respectively. A semi-logarithmic plot of the data shown in Fig. 2C, if fit with a line, gives a ∼48.3 mV shift in reversal potential for a 10-fold change in [K+]o. The relationship between the relative Er and [K+]o was non-linear curve-fitted with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation. Least square fit of the relative Erversus [K+]o resulted a permeability ratio of PNa/K = PNa/PK = 0.058. Fig. 2D shows the [K]o-dependent unitary conductance changes. Single channel slope conductances g between –100 and –40 mV are 6.8 ± 0.6 pS (n = 3) with 10 mm, 14.0 ± 0.6 pS (n = 6) with 50 mm, and 24.6 ± 1.0 pS (n = 8) with 150 mm [K+]o. The relationship between unitary conductance g and [K+]o can be approximately fitted with a power function of g ∼ [K+]n with an exponent n = 0.49. This is nearly a perfect square root function, typical of K+ channels and in general agreement with values of 0.66 for Kir4.2 (13Pearson W.L. Dourado M. Schreiber M. Salkoff L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. 1999; 514: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and 0.54 for Kir4.1 (14Shuck M.E. Piser T.M. Bock J.H. Slightom J.L. Lee K.S. Bienkowski M.J. J. Biol.

Based on the electrophysiological data, we attempted to amplify three relevant Kir genes: Kir4.1, Kir4.2, and Kir5.1. Kir5.1 is known to form heteromultimers with Kir4 subunits, so it is important to know if it is expressed. RT-PCR analysis in Fig. 3 shows that among the mRNA species examined, Kir4.2 was the only transcript expressed in appreciable amounts in the Calu-3 cells. The following experiments were designed to provide a more detailed characterization of the Calu-3 apical K+ channel.Fig. 3RT-PCR evidence for expression of Kir4.2 but not Kir4.1 or Kir 5.1 in Calu-3 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Three Modes of Gating—The Kir channels remained active in multichannel patches for more than 30 min after excision, but the open probability (Po) fluctuated markedly. This complicated gating behavior is illustrated in Fig. 4A, a 35-min recording of a single Kir channel in 150 mm [KCl]o/[K-glutamate]i. Po(t) was computed from the normalized average of 5000 data points for every 10 s, and the resulting time-dependent Po was plotted (Fig. 4B). For this channel the mean overall was Po = 0.55 ± 0.27 (S.D.).Fig. 4Gating analysis revealed three distinct gating modes. A, a single channel current trace recorded with a clock of 200 μs for over 35 min at –60 mV. B, fluctuation in Po(t) computed from the box average of the above trace. C, A trace expanded from a part of the above trace, consists of several different gating modes. D, a trace expanded from the long bursts portion reveals very fast closures. E, an expanded trace from the portion of the short burst mode. F, Po distribution histogram with a bin width of 0.05. Peaks were least squares fitted with three Gaussians.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)An expanded portion of the single channel current trace (Fig. 4C) shows that the gating consisted of at least three modes that were captured sequentially in this sample, which shows a long burst, followed by short bursts and then the start of a long closure, which could last for several or tens of seconds. Fig. 4D further expands the long burst portion to show interruptions by very fast closures, and Fig. 4E details the short burst portion that includes multiple opening and closing events lasting a few tenths of a second.To further quantify multi-modal gating, we determined the Po for each gating mode. An intuitive and convenient way to illustrate this analysis is depicted in Fig. 4F. First, the single channel current trace was reduced by averaging every 2-s interval of the original data. Then the reduced data were binned to make an open probability (Po) distribution histogram with a bin width of 0.05. Three major peaks appeared in the histogram, and these were fitted with Gaussian distributions using least squares fits. The fitted peak with the lowest Po corresponded to the long closures and had an average Po = 0.10 and an area (representing the percent time in this mode) of 5.1. The middle peak corresponded to the short bursts and had an intermediate Po = 0.42 and an area of 31.4. The third peak, corresponding to the long bursts, had a Po = 0.80 and an area of 16.6. The middle peak was several folds wider (0.58) than the left (0.08) or right (0.16) peaks, suggesting that it might represent more than one gating mode.Fluctuations like those shown in Fig. 4 were sometimes superimposed upon a gradual decrease in Po that occurred overall during recordings of 10–60 min. This slow rundown was inconsistent from patch to patch, but when it happened it was characterized by a decrease in the long burst open time and an increase in the long closed time. The presence of 2 mm ATP in the bath did not prevent rundown.Characteristics of Cs+and Ba2+Block—Cs+ block from the extracellular surface was examined by recording channel activity in the inside-out configuration with pipettes containing various levels of Cs+. In the presence of [Cs+]o, current traces showed apparent reductions in unitary current amplitude as a result of fast block (Fig. 5A). I–V curves (Fig. 5B) revealed that the inward currents were blocked at hyperpolarized potentials, whereas outward currents were virtually unchanged.Fig. 5Cs+ blocks from the extracellular surface. A, unitary current amplitudes are reduced by the extracellular Cs+ block at potential –160 mV. B, I–V curves show the voltage-dependent Cs+ block at three concentration levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Normalizing the Cs+-blocked I–V curves to the control I–V curves gave the remaining fractions in the presence of [Cs+]o shown in Fig. 5A. Error bars represent transformed S.E. Data were least square fitted with the Boltzmann function. The half-maximum potentials are –255, –158, and –84 mV for [Cs+] levels of 1, 5, and 20 mm, respectively. Fig. 6A depicts the Cs+-blocked currents normalized to that of the control versus [Cs+]o. The solid lines represent the least squares fit to the Hill equation. The fitted Kd(V) = 2.9, 3.6, 3.9, 5.4, 6.9, 11.6, 20.6, and 39.0 mm corresponding the membrane voltages from –200 to –60 mV with a step of 20, respectively. The voltage dependence of these Cs+ dissociation constants is plotted in the inset of Fig. 6B and fitted by a Woodhull-type exponential relationship that results in an electrical distance of δ = 0.69.Fig. 6Analysis of Cs+ block. A, voltage dependence of Cs+ block is illustrated by normalizing the Cs+ block I–V curves. Normalized remaining currents, caused by the Cs+ block, are fit with Boltzmann functions, resulting in voltages (V0.5) at which half the channels are open at different levels of [Cs+]. Error bars represent transformed S.E. ± mean. B, concentration-dependent Cs+ is illustrated by the fractional block (f), fitted with f = 1/{1 + (Kd(V)/[Cs+])H} shown as solid lines. H is the Hill coefficient ∼1. The fitted Cs+ dissociation constants, Kd(V), are plotted in the inset, which can be fitted with a simple exponential function defined by Woodhull: Kd(V) = Kd(0) × exp{–δFV/RT}, where δ is electrical distance and F/RT have their usual meanings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ba2+ block of Kir was examined in the same way as Cs+ block, by filling the pipette with 0.5 mm Ba2+. In contrast to the Cs+ block, which reduced the unitary current, Ba2+ induced a voltage-dependent, discrete block (Fig. 7). It appears that at hyperpolarized potentials, Ba2+ caused an increase in the closed time. These results with blockers provide an additional signature for this channel.Fig. 7Voltage dependent Ba2+ block. Pipettes were filled with 0.5 mm Ba2+ to examine the Kir current blocked from the external surface. In contrast to the external Cs+ block, which reduced the unitary current, Ba2+ induced a voltage-dependent, discrete block. It appears that at hyperpolarized potentials, the closed time caused by barium block increases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The basolateral membranes of Calu-3 cells contain K+ channels that are strongly and directly activated by 1-EBIO and are inhibited by clotrimazole. To determine whether the apical K+ channel shared these properties, the apical K+ conductance was tested in Ussing chambers using 5 mm Ba2+ added to the apical chamber. The magnitude of the apical Ba2+ block (under conditions mentioned under “Materials and Methods”) was compared before and after 1-EBIO (500 μm, n = 8), and before and after clotrimazole (50 μm, n = 8). Neither compound caused a significant difference in the magnitude of the Ba2+-blockable K+ conductance.ATP Weakly Activated Kir—ATP was not required for channel opening, as shown by our routine observation of Kir activity in ATP-free conditions. Furthermore, when partial rundown was observed it was not prevented by the presence of 2 mm ATP. To look for more subtle effects of ATP on channel gating, we used larger tipped pipettes to obtain patches with multiple K+ channels, so that fluctuation-induced error would be reduced relative to the signal. Then, the multiple (n > 2) channel patches were rapidly and repeatedly switched among several ATP levels by moving them into different streams of a multibarrel perfusion outlet.Under these conditions, responses to ATP could be observed even in the raw traces (Fig. 8A). For analysis, control currents (0 ATP) from before and after a given ATP concentration were averaged (mean at –60 mV =–4.23 ± 0.29 pA, n = 29) and the percentage increases relative to the average were computed. This method minimized the remaining fluctuations and possible rundown. Data were compiled in this way for 6 patches, with 8–12 trials each (Fig. 8B). The data show a 35% increase in Kir currents for ATP levels of 2 or 10 mmversus 0 or 0.5 mm (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, t test). Note that if a Po"
https://openalex.org/W1967722399,"Overexpression of the human REL transcription factor can malignantly transform chicken spleen cells in vitro. In this report, we have created and characterized a cDNA encoding a chimeric protein (RELΔ424–490-ER) in which sequences of a highly transforming REL mutant (RELΔ424–490) are fused to the ligand-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (ER). Surprisingly, RELΔ424–490-ER is constitutively nuclear in A293 cells, and RELΔ424–490-ER activates transcription in the absence, but not in the presence, of estrogen in κB-site reporter gene assays. Furthermore, RELΔ424–490-ER transforms chicken spleen cells in the absence of estrogen, but the addition of estrogen blocks the ability of RELΔ424–490-ER-transformed cells to form colonies in soft agar, even though estrogen induces increased nuclear translocation of RELΔ424–490-ER in these cells. ERα can also inhibit REL-dependent transactivation in trans in an estrogen-dependent manner, and ERα can interact with REL in vitro. Thus, the RELΔ424–490-ER fusion protein shows an unusual, reverse hormone regulation, in that its most prominent biological activities (transformation and transactivation) are inhibited by estrogen, probably due to an estrogen-induced interaction between the ER sequences and sequences in the Rel homology domain. Nevertheless, these results indicate that the continual activity of REL is required to sustain the transformed state of chicken spleen cells in culture, suggesting that direct and specific inhibitors of REL may have therapeutic efficacy in certain human lymphoid cancers."
