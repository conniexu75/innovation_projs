https://openalex.org/W2044597283,"The development of type II diabetes was shown to be associated with the formation of amyloid fibrils consisted of the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP or amylin). Recently, a short functional hexapeptide fragment of IAPP (NH<sub>2</sub>-NFGAIL-COOH) was found to form fibrils that are very similar to those formed by the full-length polypeptide. To better understand the specific role of the residues that compose the fragment, we performed a systematic alanine scan of the IAPP ""basic amyloidogenic units."" Turbidity assay experiments demonstrated that the wild-type peptide and the Asn<sup>1</sup> → Ala and Gly<sup>3</sup> → Ala peptides had the highest rate of aggregate formation, whereas the Phe<sup>2</sup> → Ala peptide did not form any detectable aggregates. Dynamic light-scattering experiments demonstrated that all peptides except the Phe<sup>2</sup> → Ala form large multimeric structures. Electron microscopy and Congo red staining confirmed that the structures formed by the various peptides are indeed amyloid fibrils. Taken together, the results of our study provide clear experimental evidence for the key role of phenylalanine residue in amyloid formation by IAPP. In contrast, glycine, a residue that was suggested to facilitate amyloid formation in other systems, has only a minor role, if any, in this case. Our results are discussed in the context of the remarkable occurrence of aromatic residues in short functional fragments and potent inhibitors of amyloid-related polypeptides. We hypothesize that π-π interactions may play a significant role in the molecular recognition and self-assembly processes that lead to amyloid formation."
https://openalex.org/W1993102144,"Obesity, defined as an increase in adipose tissue mass, is the most prevalent nutritional disorder in industrialized countries and is a growing problem in developing countries. An increase in adipose tissue mass can be the result of the production of new fat cells through the process of adipogenesis and/or the deposition of increased amounts of cytoplasmic triglyceride per cell. Although much has been learned about the differentiation of adipocytes in vitro, less is known about the molecular basis for the mechanisms regulating adipogenesis in vivo. Here oligonucleotide microarrays have been used to compare the patterns of gene expression in preadipocytes and adipocytes in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that the cellular programs associated with adipocyte differentiation are considerably more complex than previously appreciated and that a greater number of heretofore uncharacterized gene regulatory events are activated during this process in vitro. In addition, the gene expression changes associated with adipocyte development in vivo and in vitro, while overlapping, are in some respects quite different. These data further suggest that one or more transcriptional programs are activated exclusively in vivo to generate the full adipocyte phenotype. This gene expression survey now sets the stage for further studies to dissect the molecular differences between in vivo and in vitro adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1986824675,"The ability of insulin to protect neurons from apoptosis was examined in differentiated R28 cells, a neural cell line derived from the neonatal rat retina. Apoptosis was induced by serum deprivation, and the number of pyknotic cells was counted. p53 and Akt were examined by immunoblotting after serum deprivation and insulin treatment, and caspase-3 activation was examined by immunocytochemistry. Serum deprivation for 24 h caused ∼20% of R28 cells to undergo apoptosis, detected by both pyknosis and activation of caspase-3. 10 nm insulin maximally reduced the amount of apoptosis with a similar potency as 1.3 nm (10 ng/ml) insulin-like growth factor 1, which acted as a positive control. Insulin induced serine phosphorylation of Akt, through the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase pathway. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase with wortmannin or LY294002 blocked the ability of insulin to rescue the cells from apoptosis. SN50, a peptide inhibitor of NF-κB nuclear translocation, blocked the rescue effect of insulin, but neither insulin or serum deprivation induced phosphorylation of IκB. These results suggest that insulin is a survival factor for retinal neurons by activating the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway and by reducing caspase-3 activation. The rescue effect of insulin does not appear to be mediated by NF-κB or p53. These data suggest that insulin provides trophic support for retinal neurons through a PI 3-kinase/Akt-dependent pathway.

Brain Res. Bull. 1983; 10: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Less is known about neurons from the retina, but it is clear that the retina expresses abundant insulin receptors, which are at the highest concentration in the inner plexiform layer, where many neuronal projections are located (2Naeser P.

Barres B.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 805-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) have shown that insulin is among the growth factors that promote survival and growth of primary retinal ganglion cells in culture. The insulin receptor has multiple downstream targets that are conserved in many cell types. It is generally thought that its antiapoptotic mechanism signals primarily through PI 3- kinase to activate the serine-threonine kinase, Akt (5Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R.

Akt inhibits many proapoptotic targets by phosphorylating caspase-9, glycogen synthase kinase, BCL-2-associated death promoter, and members of the forkhead family (6Datta S.R. Brunet A.

Insulin also inhibits the release of cytochromec from mitochondria and IκB, which regulates NF-κB translocation (13Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell.

NF-κB is a transcription factor that is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and has been implicated in neuronal survival (19Mattson M.P. Culmsee C., Yu, Z. Camandola S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). NF-κB may also be involved in insulin signaling to prevent apoptosis. Insulin activates NF-κB in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the insulin receptor, and the anti-apoptotic signal of insulin is blocked by overexpression of a dominant negative IκB-α, which is the inhibitory peptide for NF-κB (20Bertrand F. Atfi A. Cadoret A. L'Allemain G. Robin H. Lascols O. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2931-2938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is possible that the anti-apoptotic effect mediated by NF-κB is due to increased transcription of manganese-superoxide dismutase (21Bertrand F. Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Prunier C. Robin H. Capeau J. Atfi A. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30596-30602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the NF-κB c-rel subunit in neurons blocked apoptosis as potently as IGF-1, whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative IκB-α enhanced apoptosis, suggesting that the function of NF-κB in neurons is primarily neuroprotective (22Heck S. Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Behl C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9828-9835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor gene p53 is also strongly implicated in apoptosis of neurons (23Hughes P.E. Alexi T. Schreiber S.S. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: v-xiiCrossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 24Inamura N. Araki T. Enokido Y. Nishio C. Aizawa S. Hatanaka H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although p53 is known to induce growth arrest, it is likely that it induces apoptosis by an independent mechanism (25Bennett M.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p53 in postmitotic neurons leads to apoptosis (26Slack R.S. Belliveau D.J. Rosenberg M. Atwal J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and involves activation of BAX and caspase-3 (27Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Craig C.G. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7860-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p53 also up-regulates glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in cerebellar granule neurons during apoptosis (28Chen R.W. Saunders P.A. Wei H. Li Z. Seth P. Chuang D.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9654-9662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, p53 may not be involved in apoptosis induced by factors that do not lead directly to DNA damage, such as low potassium (29Enokido Y. Araki T. Tanaka K. Aizawa S. Hatanaka H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1812-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Paterson I.A. Zhang D. Warrington R.C. Boulton A.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The involvement of p53 in apoptosis of retinal neurons is unclear, but it is elevated after retinal ischemia (31Joo C.K. Choi J.S. Ko H.W. Park K.Y. Sohn S. Chun M.H. Oh Y.J. Gwag B.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 713-720PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we tested the hypothesis that physiological concentrations of insulin may act as a survival factor in R28 cells, which are a subclone of E1A-NR.3 transfected rat retina cells (32Seigel G.M. Liu L. Mol. Vis. 1997; 3: 14PubMed Google Scholar, 33Seigel G.M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 32: 66-68Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). R28 cells were originally isolated from neonatal (P12) rat retina as a mixed cell type and transfected with an E1A construct (34Seigel G.M. Mutchler A.L. Imperato E.L. Mol. Vis. 1996; 2: 2PubMed Google Scholar). They have been described as having both neuronal and glial characteristics, expressing the neuron-specific antigen Thy 1.1 and some glial cell markers (34Seigel G.M. Mutchler A.L. Imperato E.L. Mol. Vis. 1996; 2: 2PubMed Google Scholar, 35Seigel G.M. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 4PubMed Google Scholar). We first show that a combination of laminin substrate and cAMP induces a neuronal phenotype in these cells (36Davis G.E. Varon S. Engvall E. Manthorpe M. Trends Neurosci. 1985; 8: 528-532Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The ability of insulin to rescue R28 cells from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation was investigated. The data demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway mediates the survival effect of insulin and leads to inhibition of caspase-3. Insulin was from bovine pancreas extract (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) 28 USP units/mg; recombinant human IGF-1 (R3 mutant, resistant to IGF-binding proteins) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); cell culture medium and bovine newborn serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD). All dry chemicals were from Fisher and Sigma. Wortmannin, LY294002, PD98059, and SN-50, an NF-κB peptide translocation sequence inhibitor, were from Biomol. Laminin and RNase were from Sigma. The IGF-1 receptor inhibitor JB3 was a generous gift from Dr. Lois E. H. Smith, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard University. R28 Cells were seeded at 4 × 105 cells/cm2 on 60-mm dishes coated with laminin and 2 × 105 cells/cm2on glass coverslips for immunocytochemistry and apoptosis assays. They were fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum and 250 µm pCPT-cyclic AMP, a cell-permeable cAMP analogue (Sigma). At the start of each experiment, all cells were rinsed in PBS and then treated with fresh medium with or without serum, insulin, recombinant mutant IGF-1, or IGF-1 receptor inhibitor, JB3 (37Smith L.E. Shen W. Perruzzi C. Soker S. Kinose F. Xu X. Robinson G. Driver S. Bischoff J. Zhang B. Schaeffer J.M. Senger D.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1390-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The half-life of insulin in this medium was 49.7 h, measured by insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Alpco, Windham, NH) in samples of culture medium taken from cells treated with 10 nm insulin for 48 h. The concentration of insulin in the undiluted serum was estimated as 0.2 ng/ml by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cells were grown to 90% confluence before 24-h experimental treatment. The coverslips were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde before staining with 1 µg/ml propidium iodide and 0.5 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma). Cells were viewed using the × 40 objective of an Olympus BH-2 fluorescence microscope mounted with a Sony 3CCD video camera attached to an IBM personal computer running image analysis software (Optimus, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Five visual fields were randomly sampled from each coverslip and all the cells in each field were counted as either pyknotic, mitotic, or viable. The number of pyknotic cells was summated in the five sampled regions and expressed as percentage of apoptosis per coverslip = (total number of pyknotic cells) (total number of pyknotic cells + total number of viable cells) × 100. A similar approach was used to estimate the percentage of mitotic cells. The cells were harvested as described previously (38Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Hollinger L.A. Wolpert E.B. Gardner T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23463-23467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) in Triton buffer (10 mm HEPES, 42 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mmbenzamidine, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor tablet; Roche, Mannheim, Germany). To detect receptor phosphorylation, an immunoprecipitation buffer was used (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Ca Cl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 protease inhibitor tablet/10 ml). For Akt immunoblotting, the following lysis buffer was used: 10 mm HEPES, 42 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 mm 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm benzamidine, 1% Triton, and 1 protease inhibitor tablet/10 ml. Protein concentrations were measured with the Pierce BCA reagent, and all samples were adjusted for equal protein before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-insulin or anti-IGF-1 receptor-β subunits (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, San Diego, CA), 1 µg/mg protein/ml, and 30 µl protein A-Sepharose beads. Samples were mixed with 5× sample buffer (0.32 m Tris, pH 6.8, 62.5% glycerol, 6.25% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% SDS, 5.6 mg/ml bromphenol blue) and boiled for 3 min before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphotyrosine blotting was performed with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) followed by biotinylated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) and alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Protein bands were detected by enhanced chemical fluorescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and read with a Fluorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Phosphotyrosine blots were washed overnight and reprobed with the polyclonal anti-insulin receptor-β, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and detected using enhanced chemical luminescence. Whole lysate immunoblotting was performed using enhanced chemical fluorescence, as described (38Antonetti D.A. Barber A.J. Hollinger L.A. Wolpert E.B. Gardner T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23463-23467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). p53 was detected with polyclonal rabbit anti-p53 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); Akt and Ser 473 phospho-Akt were detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Densitometric analysis of enhanced chemical fluorescence immunoblots was performed with ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and analysis of ECL immunoblots was performed with NIH Image. R28 cells grown on laminin-coated coverslips were deprived of serum and treated for 24 h with or without 10 nm insulin or 1.3 nm IGF-1–3R, which has decreased affinity for IGF-binding proteins relative to native IGF-1 (39Francis G.L. Ross M. Ballard F.J. Milner S.J. Senn C. McNeil K.A. Wallace J.C. King R. Wells J.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against activated caspase-3 (CM-1, Idun Pharmaceuticals, La Jolla, CA) or a rabbit anti-rat antibody against p65 of NF-κB (a generous gift of Dr. Shao-Cong Sun, Pennsylvania State University) (both antibodies at 1:1000). The secondary antibody was rhodamine red X-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:2000, Jackson Immunologicals, West Grove, PA). Cells were simultaneously stained with the nuclear dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst dye 33258, 0.5 µg/ml, Sigma). R28 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 2.5 µg of either the parental pCMV4 or the pCMV4-HA-IκBα S36A expression vector and seeded on coverslips. The parental vector pCMV4 and the cDNA expression vector encoding the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged IκBα with a serine to alanine substitution at residue 36 (S36A) (pCMV4-HA-IκBα S36A) were generous gifts from Dr. Shao-Cang Sun from Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine (Hershey, PA) (40Sun S. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the cells were either left in serum or deprived of serum with or without 10 nm insulin and incubated for another 24 h. The cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and blocked at room temperature for 1 h in PBS containing 0.1% Triton and 10% donkey serum (PBST). They were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in PBST with rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (1:200, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The cells were washed and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with rhodamine red X-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) and 0.5 µg/ml Hoechst 33258. Statistical comparisons were made by one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test (Instat 2.0, GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was accepted if p < 0.05. R28 cells have been described as expressing both neuronal and glial cell markers (34Seigel G.M. Mutchler A.L. Imperato E.L. Mol. Vis. 1996; 2: 2PubMed Google Scholar). In order to induce an entirely neuronal phenotype, the cells were seeded on laminin and fed with medium containing cell-permeable cAMP. Under these conditions, the R28 cells adopt a neuronal morphology, with neurite-like projections (Fig.1, A and B), and their rate of division is reduced. Immunoblotting showed that the differentiated R28 cells contain the neuronal markers, neuron-specific enolase (Fig. 1 C), and 200-kDa neurofilament (both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated; Fig. 1 D) but do not have detectable levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (Fig.1 E; no band could be detected when the brightness and contrast settings on the blot image were increased to the upper limits of sensitivity). Immunoreactivity for neuron-specific enolase was also abundant, measured by immunocytochemistry, and distributed homogeneously throughout the entire cell population (data not shown). Immunocytochemistry also revealed immunoreactivity for phosphorylated neurofilament but not glial fibrillary acidic protein or the endothelial cell antigen von Willebrand factor (data not shown). Thus, R28 cells can be differentiated in this way to provide a usefulin vitro model of retinal neurons. Insulin mediates cell survival in primary cell cultures of cerebellar neurons and retinal ganglion cells (1Huck S. Brain Res. Bull. 1983; 10: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Meyer-Franke A. Kaplan M.R. Pfrieger F.W. Barres B.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 805-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). To determine whether insulin can also act as a survival factor for the R28 model of retinal neurons, the effect of insulin on apoptosis in serum-deprived cells was quantified. A time course study showed that the rate of apoptosis peaked at 16–18 h after serum withdrawal (data not shown). Cells were deprived of serum for 24 h and treated with either 10 nm insulin or 1.3 nm recombinant mutant IGF-1 (3R), which served as a positive control. The number of apoptotic cells was counted after propidium iodide staining. Between 10 and 20% of cells were pyknotic after 24 h of serum deprivation, whereas less than 1% were pyknotic in control conditions (Fig.2A). Treatment with insulin significantly reduced the frequency of pyknosis (Fig. 2 B;p < 0.05). Higher concentrations of insulin had no greater effect on apoptosis, indicating that the maximal effect was at 10 nm (Fig. 2 C). Insulin treatment had no effect on the frequency of mitosis (Fig. 2 C). The IGF-1 inhibitor JB3 (37Smith L.E. Shen W. Perruzzi C. Soker S. Kinose F. Xu X. Robinson G. Driver S. Bischoff J. Zhang B. Schaeffer J.M. Senger D.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1390-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) prevented IGF-1 from rescuing cells by 50% but did not block the survival effect of insulin (data not shown). There was no greater effect of adding insulin and IGF-1 together (data not shown). These results suggest that insulin blocks apoptosis in retinal neurons by increasing cell survival rather than proliferation. The insulin receptor signaling system in R28 cells was explored by immunoblotting for the α-subunit of the insulin receptor. R28 cells express both the 125-kDa isoform of the α-chain, similar to the most abundant form in liver (41Waldbillig R.J. Fletcher R.T. Chader G.J. Rajagopalan S. Rodrigues M. LeRoith D. Exp. Eye Res. 1987; 45: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), as well as the 115-kDa isoform that is typical of the adult retina (Fig.3A). By immunoprecipitation of the β-subunits of the insulin or IGF-1 receptors, followed by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, it was determined that the insulin receptors were tyrosine-phosphorylated by 10 nm insulin, whereas the IGF-1 receptors were not (Fig. 3 B). By two-point binding assay with 0.5 nmol of 125I-bovine insulin, the concentration of insulin receptors in the R28 cells was 110 pmol/mg total protein, which is comparable to that measured in liver plasma membranes and hepatocytes (42Almira E.C. Reddy W.J. Endocrinology. 1979; 104: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The content of IGF-1 receptors in R28 cells was also similar to that of whole retina, measured by immunoblot. The content of insulin receptors in R28 cells was also comparable to that of equivalent protein samples of whole retina and liver lysates (data not shown). These data show that the survival effect of 10 nm insulin is mediated through the insulin receptor and not IGF-1. Many growth factors have antiapoptotic effects via activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt/protein kinase B in various cell types (6Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3718) Google Scholar), so the involvement of these pathways was investigated in differentiated R28 cells. Cells were treated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (10 µm) or with the MEK kinase inhibitor PD98059 (25 µm), dissolved in dilute Me2SO. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity with wortmannin (100 nm) or the more specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 µm) blocked the ability of both insulin and IGF-1 to rescue R28 cells from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (Fig. 4). The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 also blocked insulin-mediated survival, but the magnitude of inhibition was not as great as that induced by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Therefore, the PI 3-kinase pathway has a primary role in survival mediated by insulin. Activation of the downstream target of the PI 3-kinase pathway, Akt, was investigated by immunoblotting with antibodies to total Akt and to Ser 473-phosphorylated Akt. Total Akt content was unchanged after serum deprivation, and there was a low basal level of Akt phosphorylation. The amount of Ser 473-phosphorylated Akt increased significantly within 10 min of insulin stimulation in the absence of serum (Fig.5A). Akt phosphorylation was also induced by insulin in cells grown with serum (data not shown). Wortmannin and LY294002 both blocked the Akt serine phosphorylation induced by insulin when serum was removed (Fig. 5 B). The reduction in Akt phosphorylation was statistically significant (Fig.5 C; p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained after stimulation with IGF-1. These data suggest that insulin induces Akt phosphorylation through PI 3-kinase in retinal neurons. Caspase-3 is a cysteine protease that becomes active during the later stages of apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that activated caspase-3 can be detected by immunocytochemistry using the antibody CM-1 (43Srinivasan A. Roth K.A. Sayers R.O. Shindler K.S. Wong A.M. Fritz L.C. Tomaselli K.J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1004-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry for activated caspase-3 was performed on serum-deprived R28 cells using the CM-1 antibody. The cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 dye to reveal nuclear morphology. In cells grown with serum, there was little CM-1 immunoreactivity, and almost all cells had normal nuclear morphology (Fig. 6). In contrast, many of the serum-deprived cells were immunoreactive for caspase-3. Those cells with caspase-3 immunoreactivity also tended to have pyknotic nuclei. Both insulin and IGF-1 reduced CM-1 immunoreactivity and the number of pyknotic cells, whereas LY294002 blocked these effects. Thus, insulin inhibits the activation of caspase-3 by a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism. Insulin induces activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB in sympathetic and cerebellar neurons (22Heck S. Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Behl C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9828-9835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 44Maggirwar S.B. Sarmiere P.D. Dewhurst S. Freeman R.S. J.

A. 1999; 96: 9409-9414Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In order to test whether translocation of p65 NF-κB is also required for rescue by insulin in R28 cells, four approaches were used. First, the peptide inhibitor of the NF-κB nuclear localization sequence, SN50, was tested. SN50 is a cell-permeable antisense peptide that binds to the nuclear translocation region of NF-κB and prevents it from being transported to the nucleus (46Lin Y.-Z. Yao S. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). SN50 alone increased the number of pyknotic cells in serum-deprived cultures (Fig.7A), whereas the control peptide, SN50M, which is mutated to prevent its peptide binding ability, had no effect on apoptosis. SN50 blocked the ability of insulin to rescue R28 cells from apoptosis and also increased the number of pyknotic cells significantly more than serum deprivation (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, SN50 blocked the ability of IGF-1 to prevent apoptosis but did not increase the amount of apoptosis any more than serum deprivation (Fig. 7 C). The mutated peptide, SN50M, did not block the effects of insulin or IGF-1. These data suggest that NF-κB translocation may be involved in cell survival induced by insulin. Second, to examine nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB directly, we used immunocytochemistry in R28 cells treated with or without insulin. R28 cells were grown in the presence of insulin for 6 or 24 h, fixed, and labeled with an antibody to the p65 subunit of NF-κB. No nuclear localization of p65 was observed after any of the treatment conditions (Fig. 8), suggesting that insulin does not induce nuclear translocation of NF-κβ in R28 cells. Third, R28 cells were transfected with a dominant negative construct of IκB, which cannot be activated by phosphorylation. About 20% of the cells were transfected successfully, indicated by positive HA immunoreactivity. However, none of the transfected cells contained pyknotic nuclei or caspase-3 immunoreactivity after serum deprivation (data not shown). These data suggest that transfection of a dominant negative IκB caused the cells to be resistant to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. In the fourth and final approach, we examined the phosphorylation of IκB. In order for NF-κB to be translocated to the nucleus, IκB must be phosphorylated. To test whether this occurs during apoptosis in R28 cells, immunoblotting with a phospho-specific antibody to IκB was carried out on lysates of cells that had been serum-deprived and treated with insulin, IGF-1, or LY294002. The cell lysates were also immunoblotted for Ser 473-phosphor"

The group A members hHb1, hHb3, and hHb6 are structurally related, whereas group C members hHb2, hHb4, and hHb5 are rather distinct. Specific antisera against the individual hair keratins were used to establish the two-dimensional catalog of human type II hair keratins. In this catalog, hHb5 showed up as a series of isoelectric variants, well separated from a lower, more acidic, and complex protein streak containing isoelectric variants of hair keratins hHb1, hHb2, hHb3, and hHb6. Both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry on anagen hair follicles showed that hHb5 and hHb2 defined early stages of hair differentiation in the matrix (hHb5) and cuticle (hHb5 and hHb2), respectively. Although cuticular differentiation proceeded without the expression of further type II hair keratins, cortex cells simultaneously expressed hHb1, hHb3, and hHb6 at an advanced stage of differentiation. In contrast, hHb4, which is undetectable in hair follicle extracts and sections, could be identified as the largest and most alkaline member of this subfamily in cytoskeletal extracts of dorsal tongue. This hair keratin was localized in the posterior compartment of the tongue filiform papillae. Comparative analysis of type II with the previously published type I hair keratin expression profiles suggested specific, but more likely, random keratin-pairing principles during trichocyte differentiation. Finally, by combining the previously published type I hair keratin catalog with the type II hair keratin catalog and integrating both into the existing catalog of human epithelial keratins, we present a two-dimensional compilation of the presently known human keratins.

Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev.

Plenum Publishing Corp, New York1998: 71-95Google Scholar). Earlier gel electrophoretic studies on native hair keratins of several mammals including man revealed the presence of four type I (44–48 kDa) and four type II (55–60 kDa) members (4Heid H.W. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 5Lynch M.H. O'Guin W.M. Hardy C. Mak L. Sun T.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2593-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). According to a proposal by Heid et al. (4Heid H.W. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), hair keratins were collectively designated “H” for hair, “b” for the basic members (Hb),1 and “a” for the acidic members (Ha), with the two-dimensionally resolved and Coomassie-stained protein spots of each subfamily being numbered from 1 to 4 in a counterclockwise manner. In addition to the “major” hair keratins hHa1–hHa4 and hHb1–hHb4, a weakly expressed additional pair was designated Hax/Hbx (4Heid H.W. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6Heid H.W. Moll I. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1988; 37: 137-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The hair keratin family was therefore suggested to comprise 10 individual members and thus to be considerably smaller than the family of epithelial keratins. Recent investigations in our laboratory have shown, however, that the human hair keratin family is distinctly more complex than previously assumed. Subsequent to the characterization of seven type I hair keratins and four type II hair keratins isolated from a human scalp cDNA library (7-11) and the demonstration that the genes of type I and II hair keratins are located on chromosomes 17q12-21 and 12q13, respectively (9Rogers M.A. Nischt R. Korge B. Krieg T. Fink T.M. Lichter P. Winter H. Schweizer J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the screening of a P1 artificial chromosome library with polymerase chain reaction primers for two randomly selected type I hair keratins yielded a 190-kilobase pair P1 artificial chromosome contig that contained nine functional hair keratin genes, hHa1–hHa8(including two highly related hHa3 genes, hHa3-Iand hHa3-II), and one transcribed pseudogene,ϕhHaA, within a 140-kilobase region (12Rogers M.A. Winter H. Wolf C. Jacobs M. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26683-26691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). By means of both specific cRNA probes and specific antibodies for the individual type I hair keratins, we subsequently elucidated the complex expression patterns of the members of this subfamily in the hair follicle (13Langbein L.

In addition, the antibodies were used to establish by Western blotting a two-dimensional catalog of the type I hair keratin subfamily (13Langbein L. Rogers M.A. Winter H. Praetzel S. Beckhaus U. Rackwitz H.R. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19874-19884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Recently, we used P1 artificial chromosome cloning to unravel the organization of the human type II hair keratin gene locus. This resulted in the characterization of an ∼200-kilobase pair DNA domain that also contained 10 hair keratin genes (14Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Wolf C. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 464-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, unlike the type I hair keratin genes, only six of these genes,hHb1–hHb6, were functional, whereas the remaining members either represented nontranscribed (ϕhHbA,ϕhHbB, and ϕhHbC) or transcribed (ϕhHbD) pseudogenes. We were also able to show that the type II hair keratin domain is flanked by the genes for the epithelial keratins K6hf and K7, respectively (14Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Wolf C. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 464-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have once again used in situ hybridization with specific cRNA probes and indirect immunofluorescence studies with specific antibodies to determine the expression sites of the individual type II hair keratins in the human hair follicle. A comparison with the type I hair keratin expression pattern suggests complex dynamics of hair keratin pair formation during the process of hair shaft differentiation. We also provide a two-dimensional catalog of the presently known human type I and II hair keratins. Plucked beard hairs from two volunteers were freed from adhering outer and inner root sheaths as described previously (4Heid H.W. Werner E. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The lower part of the follicles was cut off and extracted for hair keratins (11Winter H. Hofmann I. Langbein L.

One-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE, 10% polyacrylamide) and two-dimensional resolution of hair keratins by isoelectric focusing were carried out as reported previously (11Winter H.

For isoelectric focusing, the following mixture (total volume of 1 ml) of ampholines (Bio-Rad) was used: pH 5–7, 400 μl; pH 4–6, 300 μl; and pH 3–10, 300 μl. One- and two-dimensional gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. For Western blot procedures, the proteins separated on gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) using a semidry blotting apparatus. After staining (0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250/50% methanol), destaining (50% methanol), and blocking with 5% nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (see “Antibodies” and Table I). Peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (see “Antibodies”) were diluted 1:10,000 in 2.5% nonfat milk powder/0.1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline.

Human scalp samples, obtained from surgical interventions, were provided kindly by Dr. Bernard Cribier (Dermatological Hospital, Strasbourg, France). For the detection of the various hair keratin mRNAs, the following probes were used (all probes were derived from 3′-untranslated regions and cloned into Bluescript KSII): hHb1 (phHb1–3′), a 400-bp PvuII/XhoI fragment; hHb2 (12.5cl2–3′), a 230-bp fragment obtained by the linearization of a full-length hHb2 genomic clone by digestion withBsrgI; hHb3 (phHb3–3′), a 520-bpPstI/XhoI fragment; hHb4 (phHbX-3′), a 400-bpBamHI fragment; hHb5 (phHb2–3′), a 657-bpPvuII/XhoI fragment; and hHb6 (phHb4–3′), a 300-bp SmaI/XhoI fragment. The probes were radiolabeled by in vitro transcription using35S-rCTP. For the recording of the ISH signals by reflection microscopy, a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 UV, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used. The instrument allows simultaneous visualization of ISH in epi-illumination for the detection of reflection signals and transmitted light in bright fields for hematoxylin staining. The two signal channels were combined by an overlay in pseudocolor (transmission image in green, electronically changed into black/white; reflection image, i.e. ISH signals, in red). IIF on cryostat sections of human scalp or plucked hair follicles was carried out as described previously in detail (11Winter H. Hofmann I. Langbein L. Rogers M.A. Schweizer J. J. Biol.

Primary monoclonal antibodies against hHb1 (for dilutions see Table I) and hHa2 (LHTric17 (IgM); IIF dilution 1:50) both provided kindly by Dr. I. M. Leigh (Center for Cutaneous Research, Royal London Hospital, London, UK). Antisera against the remaining human type II hair keratins were produced in guinea pigs by the injection of specific synthetic oligopeptides (100 μg/injection, see Table I), coupled to Keyhole limpet protein (Peptide Specialty Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany). After the third booster injection, antisera against hHb2, hHb3, hHb4, hHb5, and hHb6 were obtained and used at the dilutions indicated in TableI. For ECL, peroxidase-coupled rabbit anti-mouse or anti-guinea pig IgG (H+L) were used as secondary antibodies. For immunofluorescence, Cy2-, Cy3-, or Texas Red-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG or IgG+IgM or anti-guinea pig IgG were used at dilutions of 1:50–1:200. All secondary antibodies were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). We have shown previously that multiple sequence comparisons of the type II hair keratins encoded by the six functional genes contained in the human type II hair keratin gene domain on chromosome 12q13 led to a conspicuous sorting into the two groups A and C (14, for the designation of the two groups, see “Discussion”). Group A contained the highly related hair keratins hHb1, hHb3, and hHb6, whereas group C consisted of the less related hair keratins hHb2, hHb4, and hHb5. Group A members possessed head domains of almost identical length (10Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Praetzel S. Krieg T. Winter H. Schweizer J. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Wolf C. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 464-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the sequence identities of which were nearly as high as those of the rod domains. The tail domains were also rather conserved (TableII), the lower homology value being caused by sequence variations in the penultimate portion of the tail domain (10Rogers M.A. Langbein L.

In contrast, sequence identities of the group C members were essentially restricted to the rod domains, for which homology values were, however, distinctly lower than those determined for the rod and even head domains of group A members (Table II).Table IIAmino acid sequence identities of human type II hair keratinsType II hair keratin groupSequence identityHead domainsRod domainsTail domains%A: hHb1, hHb3, hHb688.497.758.8C: hHb2, hHb4, hHb544.271.035.2 Open table in a new tab With the exception of the monoclonal hHb1 antibody, antisera were raised against the various type II hair keratins by means of specific synthetic peptides, which in most cases were derived from the structurally variable tail domains (Table I). Total hair keratin extracts from human hair clippings were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie-stained patterns shown in Fig.1, a and b,lanes 1, consisted essentially of two protein doublets at 54–57 kDa (type II hair keratins) and 44–47 kDa (type I hair keratins). In Western blots, the antisera against hHb1, hHb2, hHb3, hHb5, and hHb6 each detected a single protein band within the type II hair keratin region (Fig. 1 a, lanes 2–6). In accordance with their calculated molecular masses (Table I), the slightly smaller hair keratins hHb1, hHb3, and hHb6 (mean molecular mass ∼ 54,000 kDa) were obviously all contained in the lower protein band (Fig. 1 a, lanes 2, 4, and6), whereas the larger hair keratins hHb2 and hHb5 (mean molecular mass ∼ 56,000 kDa) were constituents of the upper protein band of the type II hair keratin pattern (Fig. 1 a,lanes 3 and 5). Remarkably, none of the antisera raised against the four hHb4 peptides listed in Table I detected a protein band when reacted with keratin extracts from clipped hairs (shown for the antiserum against peptide 1 in Table I; Fig.1 a, lane 7). However, in cytoskeletal extracts of human dorsal tongue comprising both epithelial and dermal tissue components (see the complex Coomassie-stained pattern in Fig.1 b, lane 2), this hHb4 antiserum clearly revealed a distinct albeit weak protein band (Fig. 1 b, lane 4). This protein was also detected in Western blots with the antisera raised against hHb4 peptides 2–4 (Table I and results not shown). In accordance with its calculated molecular mass (∼65,000 kDa, Table I), the hHb4 protein runs distinctly above the hHb5 protein (Fig. 1 b, lane 3) detected in Western blots of hair keratin extracts (Fig. 1 b, lane 1). The two-dimensional pattern of human hair keratins is shown in Fig.2 a. It can clearly be seen that in the gel system used, the type II hair keratins were mainly resolved into two major protein streaks, an upper one, resolved into four visible protein spots in the more basic region, and a lower more acidic one, which obviously consisted of more than one protein (Fig. 2 a). Slightly above the latter, a minor streak of three faint protein spots could be detected (arrows in Fig.2 a). In Western blots, the hHb5 antiserum strongly reacted with the upper four protein spots (Fig. 2 b). Therefore, every following blot with one of the remaining antisera was stripped and re-exposed to the hHb5 antiserum, thus using hHb5 as a positional reference. This strategy showed that the hHb1 antibody (Fig.2 c) and the antisera against hHb3 (Fig. 2 e) and hHb6 (Fig. 2 f) uniformly detected the corresponding hair keratins within the major lower protein streak. Although the blots suggested that hHb3 was slightly more acidic than hHb1, hHb6 clearly represented the most acidic member of the three hair keratins (Fig.2 f). The hHb2 antiserum specifically reacted with the three minor protein spots above the bulk of hHb1, hHb3, and hHb6 (arrows in Fig. 2 d). To localize hHb4 relative to the other type II hair keratins, equal amounts of the human hair and tongue extracts were mixed and resolved two-dimensionally. Coomassie staining of the gel allowed the assignment of the type II hair keratins hHb5 and hHb1, hHb3, hHb6, and the largely unresolved bulk of type I hair keratins as well as the differentiation-specific keratin pair K4/K13 of tongue epithelium (16Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4541) Google Scholar). Western blotting with the hHb4 antiserum against peptide 1 (Table I) led to the occurrence of a single protein spot distinctly above hHb5 (designated by asterisks in Fig. 2 h) in the unstained area of the gel and showed that hHb4 represented the most basic member of the type II hair keratin subfamily (Fig.2 h). The expression patterns of the members of the two type II hair keratin groups A and C in human scalp hair follicles were investigated by both ISH using specific 3′-cRNA probes of the respective hair keratin mRNAs and IIF by means of the specific antibodies described above. In line with a previous study in our laboratory (10Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Praetzel S. Krieg T. Winter H. Schweizer J. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), ISH with the hHb1 and hHb3 cRNA probes on human scalp hairs revealed the expression of the respective mRNAs in the lower to mid-cortex region of the hair follicle (Fig. 3,a and b). Previously we placed the onset of hHb6 mRNA expression slightly above that of hHb1 and hHb3 (10Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Praetzel S. Krieg T. Winter H. Schweizer J. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but a thorough analysis of multiple independent ISH with the hHb1, hHb3, and hHb6 cRNAs rather suggested an almost simultaneous onset of expression of the three mRNAs (Fig. 3, a–c). Unlike the hHb1 and hHb3 transcripts, hHb6 transcripts clearly occurred up to the keratogenous zone of the hair shaft (Fig. 3 c). Indirect immunofluorescence studies with the hHb1, hHb3, and hHb6 antibodies confirmed the largely uniform onset of synthesis of the three hair keratins in the lower to mid-cortex but showed that all of them could be demonstrated up to the zone of fiber hardening (Fig. 3,d–f). Remarkably, the hair follicle analyzed for hHb1 synthesis represented the rare case of a human scalp hair that contained a medulla, in which hHb1 was also present (Fig.3 d). Consistently, the group A hair keratins were absent from the hair cuticle. ISH with a specific hHb2 cRNA probe on both a medullated beard hair (Fig.4 a) and human scalp hairs (Fig. 4 b) revealed transcripts of this hair keratin exclusively in the single-layered hair cuticle, which can clearly be distinguished from the cuticle of the inner root sheath at the light microscopic level (Fig. 4 a). hHb2 mRNA expression started immediately above the line of Auber (17Auber L. Trans. R. Soc. Edinb. 1952; 62: 191-254Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and gradually vanished at the height of the mid-cortex region (red arrows in Fig.4, a and b). IIF studies with the hHb2 antiserum confirmed the restriction of this hair keratin to the hair cuticle (Fig. 5 a andinset), in which it occurred up to the zone of fiber hardening. Double-labeled IIF, using the hHb2 antiserum (redin Fig. 5, b, b′), and the monoclonal antibody against the previously described type I hair keratin hHa2 in the hair cuticle (green in Fig. 5, b, b′, and Ref. 13Langbein L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19874-19884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) showed interesting details. First, the onset of synthesis of the two cuticular hair keratins was different. Although hHa2 synthesis clearly started below the line of Auber (green arrow andgreen-colored hair cuticle cells in Fig. 5, b andb′) in the lower bulb region, that of hHb2 began distinctly above this line (red arrows in Fig. 5, b andb′) thus leading to yellow-colored hHa2/hHb2 coexpressing cells in the upper hair cuticle (Fig. 5, b andb′). Second, unlike the strictly hair cuticle-specific hHb2 antiserum, the hHa2 antibody reacted, albeit faintly, also with matrix and precortex cells (Fig. 5, b and b′, and Ref.13Langbein L.

Bars, 200 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The hHb5 mRNAs occurred mainly in the matrix cells immediately above the germinative cell compartment (Fig. 4, c andd) and disappeared approximately at the same height of the mid-cortex as the hHb2 mRNAs (compare Fig. 4, a,b and c, and d). The cells bordering the dermal papilla were devoid of hHb5 transcripts (white arrowheads in Fig. 4 d), although occasionally some of them appeared to be labeled (black arrowheads inlower inset of Fig. 4 d). A closer inspection of the hybridization pattern suggested the presence of hHb5 transcripts also in the hair cuticle (Fig. 4 d andupper inset). Although the onset of cuticular and matricial hHb5 mRNA expression was coincident, its cessation in the hair cuticle occurred much earlier at the height of the precortex (red double-headed arrows in Fig. 4 d and upper inset). IIF studies with the hHb5 antiserum confirmed this complex expression pattern but in addition allowed the following of the fate of cuticular and cortical hHb5 protein up to the keratogenous zone (Fig.5, c and d). Moreover, double-labeled IIF using the hHb5 antiserum (red in Fig. 5 d) and the hHa2 antibody (green in Fig. 5 d) not only supported the notion that the onset of hair cuticle and matrix expression of hHb5 occurred at the same height in the lower bulb region of the follicle (Fig. 5 d) but also confirmed coexpression of both hair keratins not only in matrix and precortex cells (compare Fig.5 b′ and faint yellow staining in the matrix region of the follicle in Fig. 5 d) but also in the entire hair cuticle (Fig. 5 d). No hair keratin was detectable in the lower matricial region, in which the progenitor cells of the various compartments ar"

One of these receptors, LPB1, has recently been shown to be essential for mouse embryonic development. Here we disrupted the lpB3 gene in mice, resulting in the complete absence of lpB3 gene, transcript, and LPB3 protein. LPB3-null mice were viable and fertile and developed normally with no obvious phenotypic abnormality. We prepared mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells to examine effects of LPB3 deletion on S1P-induced signal transduction pathways.

All S1P receptors belong to a larger lysophospholipid (LP) receptor subfamily, which also includes receptors for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid that is structurally and biologically related to S1P. Each of the LP receptors couples to multiple subsets of heterotrimeric G proteins (including Gq, Gi/o, and G12/13) and thus drives different signal transduction pathways. Also, the receptor genes are expressed in spatially and temporally different patterns in mice (9Zhang G. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,10Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), 2J. J. A. Contos and J. Chun, unpublished observations. suggesting specific roles for each receptor in vivo. It was reported recently that LPB1-null mice are embryonic lethal because of incomplete vascular maturation (11Liu Y. Wada R. Yamashita T. Mi Y. Deng C.X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Nava V.E. Chae S.S. Lee M.J. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), showing the essential role of LPB1 in mouse development. In zebrafish, a single point mutation in an lpB ortholog, mil, led to abnormal heart development (12Kupperman E. An S. Osborne N. Waldron S. Stainier D.Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To determine in vivofunctions and roles of the LPB3 receptor in mammals, we have disrupted lpB3 in mice. Unexpectedly, LPB3-null mice were viable and fertile and developed normally with no gross phenotypic abnormality, although selective loss of S1P signal transduction pathways was observed in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. These results continue to clarify physiological functions and roles of the LPB3 receptor in vivo. [α-32P]Deoxy-CTP andmyo-[2-3H]inositol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. S1P and LPA (1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

Trizol and all cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise noted. The isolation of an lpB3 λ clone from 129/SvJ mouse genomic DNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was described previously (9Zhang G. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The 0.9-kilobase (kb) short arm (anApaI/AflII fragment upstream of the open reading frame (ORF)), the 2.3-kb ORF arm (an AflII/AflII fragment including the entire ORF) and the 2.8-kb long arm (aBglII/XhoI fragment downstream of the ORF) were cloned successively into the pFlox vector, producing thelpB3 targeting vector used in this study. TheNotI-linearized targeting construct was electroporated into R1 ES cells. The targeting was completed by homologous recombination under G418 (200 μg/ml)-positive selection and Cre recombinase-mediated deletion between loxP sites under gancyclovir (0.5 μm)-negative selection, which produced both type I (knockout (KO))- and type II-hemizygous cells. The correct integration was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using probes both inside (probe B) and outside (probe A) of the recombination site. A single type I ES clone was injected into C57BL/6N blastocysts to produce chimeric male mice, which were crossed with C57BL/6N females to obtain agouti lpB3-heterozygous pups. All mice analyzed were obtained from intercrosses between their progenies and C57BL/6N females. Histological analyses were done on the progenies on a purer C57BL/6N background (backcrossed 3–5 generations). Mice were housed in an air-conditioned room kept on a 12-h dark/light cycle and fed standard dry rodent food pellets ad libitum. All animal protocols used in this study have been approved by the Animal Subjects Committee at the University of California, San Diego, and conform to National Institutes of Health guidelines and public laws. lpB3 genotyping was done by Southern analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using tail genomic DNA as a template and the three primers: primer 1 (5′-CACAGCAAGCAGACCTCCAGA-3′), primer 2 (5′-TGGTGTGCGGCTGTCTAGTCAA-3′), and primer 3 (5′-ATCGATACCGTCGATCGACCT-3′). The PCR condition was 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Mouse tissue was quickly removed and homogenized in the Trizol reagent with the Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Total RNA was isolated following Life Technologies' instructions, and 20 μg of each RNA was analyzed as described previously (14Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Specific probes used were the ORF sequences for mouse lpB1-B4 andlpC1 cDNA. lpB1-B3were isolated as described previously (9Zhang G. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).lpB4 3A. H. Yang and J. Chun, unpublished observations. (GenBankTM accession number AF327535) andlpC1 cDNA2 were isolated from 129/SvJ mouse genomic DNA library and Swiss/Webster-NIH cDNA library (CLONTECH), respectively. The blot was also hybridized with a mouse housekeeping glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene as a loading control. Mouse tissue was quickly removed and homogenized by 100 strokes of the Tissue Grind Pestle (Kontes Glass Company, Vineland, NJ) in buffer (Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 × Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set I (Calbiochem)). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to precipitate crude membrane fraction. This fraction was solubilized in the sample buffer (60 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 6% (v/v) glycerol, 1.7% SDS, 100 mmdithiothreitol), sonicated for 5 min in the water bath-type ultrasonicator (FS3 Ultrasonic Cleaning System; Fisher), separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to the Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Because heat denaturation in the SDS-containing sample buffer before gel fractionation diminished the bands specific to the wild-type samples, the loaded sample was sonicated but not heated for complete denaturation. The LPB3 protein was detected with anti-LPB3 antibodies directed against carboxyl or amino terminus using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). lpB3-heterozygous males and females were bred to obtain all three genotypes, wild-type (lpB3+/+), heterozygous (lpB3+/−), and knockout (lpB3−/−), within the litters, and these littermates were analyzed comparatively at three developmental stages (10 days, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks). The mice were anesthetized with Nembutal sodium solution (0.75 mg/g body weight) (Abbott). Anesthetized mice were perfused through the heart with 0.9% NaCl, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Each tissue was dissected out, postfixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, and processed for paraffin embedding. Parasagittal sections (5 μm) were cut, processed, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to standard protocols. lpB3-heterozygous male and female were bred to obtain both wild-type and knockout littermates. Pregnant female was sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and embryonic day 14 (E14) embryos were removed, rapidly frozen in the Tissue-Teck optimal cutting temperature compound (Miles, Elkhart, IN), and stored at −80 °C until sectioned. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were transcribed in the sense and antisense orientations from linearized plasmids containing the entire mouse lpB3 ORF. Parasagittal cryostat sections (20 μm) were cut, and adjacent sections were hybridized with either sense or antisense riboprobes and processed as described previously (15Weiner J.A. Hecht J.H. Chun J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 398: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Chun J.J. Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Jaenisch R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 189-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). MEF cells were prepared from E14 embryos generated by the wild-type or knockout intercrosses. Briefly, the heads and internal viscera were removed, and the carcasses were finely minced with scissors and digested by incubation in 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA solution for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation. Trypsin was inactivated by adding the culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics), and the cells were filtrated through a 70-μm cell strainer (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and seeded onto tissue culture dishes. MEF cells were maintained as a monolayer culture on tissue culture dishes in the culture medium, and cells from the second to third passages were used. The entire ORF of each receptor was cloned into the pFLAG-CMV-1 mammalian expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.) for introducing preprotrypsin leader/FLAG tag sequences into an extracellular amino terminus of each receptor. This procedure enabled higher expression levels of the receptors in the plasma membrane and immunochemical detection of the receptors (data not shown; see Ref.14Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Next, all coding sequences were cloned into the retrovirus vector, LZRSpBMN-linker-IRES-EGFP, and inserts of the construct were confirmed by sequencing. The internal ribosome entry site sequence in the retroviral vector permitted concomitant expression of the receptor gene and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene from a single transcript driven by a 5′-long terminal repeat promoter, allowing identification of infected (living and fixed) cells by fluorescence microscopy. High titer, helper-free retrovirus supernatant was prepared using the Phoenix producer cell lines as described (14Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Viral supernatant supplemented with 5 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide was added to MEF cells on multiwell dishes, and the dishes were centrifuged (700 × g) at 32 °C for 1 h (14Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured for 24 h, incubated in serum-free medium for another 24 h, and then used for each experiment. Receptor gene and protein expression were confirmed by Northern blot analysis and immunostaining using anti-FLAG antibody, respectively (data not shown; refer to Ref. 14Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). By counting the numbers of cells with EGFP fluorescence (infected cell numbers) and cells with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorescence (total cell numbers) on fixed samples, an effective infection in MEF cells of >50% of total cells was confirmed. Infection was routinely confirmed by EGFP fluorescence from the living cells (14Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). MEF cells on 12-well dishes were prelabeled with [3H]inositol (2 μCi/well) in inositol-free, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. The cells were then incubated for 30 min in Hepes/Tyrode's/bovine serum albumin buffer (17Ishii I. Izumi T. Tsukamoto H. Umeyama H. Ui M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7846-7854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) containing 10 mm LiCl and stimulated with S1P or LPA. After a 20-min incubation, the reaction was terminated by aspirating the buffer and adding 500 μl of ice-cold 0.4 m HClO4. Radioactivity in the inositol phosphate (IP1 + IP2 + IP3) fractions of the samples was examined as described previously (14Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 17Ishii I. Izumi T. Tsukamoto H. Umeyama H. Ui M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7846-7854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The activity was expressed as the -fold induction above a basal level. cAMP contents were measured with the cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. MEF cells on 24-well dishes were preincubated in Hepes/Tyrode's/bovine serum albumin buffer containing 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 20 min. The cells were then stimulated for 20 min with or without 1 μm forskolin in the presence or absence of various concentrations of S1P. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the buffer and adding 500 μl of the lysis reagent 1B (as per Amersham Pharmacia Biotech instructions). After a 20-min extraction, 100 μl of the supernatant was collected for cAMP determination. The activity was expressed as a percentage of forskolin (1 μm)-induced cAMP accumulation. MEF cells on 10-cm dishes were incubated for 10 min in Hepes/Tyrode's/bovine serum albumin buffer and then stimulated with S1P. The reaction was terminated by washing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysing in 600 μl of the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and equal volumes of supernatants were incubated with rhotekin Rho binding domain (for Rho activity) or PAK-1 p21-binding domain (for Rac activity) agarose beads at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed four times with the washing buffer (0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bead-bound, GTP-bound active forms of Rho and Rac proteins were specifically detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Rho A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-Rac 1 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) monoclonal antibodies. Rho proteins in 5% and Rac proteins in 1% of the cell lysates were also detected as references. Data are the means ± S.E. of triplicate samples from a single experiment that was representative of 2–3 experiments that gave similar results. Statistical analysis was done by Student's t test or χ2 test (only in Table I), and the difference at p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.Table IInheritance of the IpB3 mutant alleleParental genotypesTotal litter numbersAverage litter sizesOffspring genotypes at weaning ages (∼3 weeks)MalesFemalesBoth sexesMale × FemaleWTHetKOWTHetKOWTHetKOHet × WT187.5 ± 2.7472927327461Het × Het576.5 ± 2.26096403891439818783Het × KO246.6 ± 1.9433343398672KO × Het216.9 ± 2.4423330397272*KO × KO255.6 ± 1.86378141Total litter numbers, average litter sizes (means ± S.D.), and numbers of genotyped offspring from the indicated crosses are shown.

To examine wild-type expression patterns of each of the five S1P receptor genes in C57BL/6N mice, total RNA from 8-week-old female tissues (except male testis) was analyzed by Northern blot using mouse ORF probes (Fig.1). The lpB1-B3expression pattern in brain, heart, lung, thymus, liver, kidney, and spleen, was consistent with our previous results obtained from analyses of adult BALB/c mice (9Zhang G. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Also, we analyzed the expression of these genes in adipose tissues (both white and brown), back skin, and sex organs (uterus and testis). Each lpB1-B3 was expressed to various degrees in all tissues examined with the exception of liver, where no detectable lpB3 expression was found. In contrast, the expression of lpB4and lpC1 was more specific.lpB4 was expressed at detectable levels only in brain and skin among the tissues we analyzed, whilelpC1 was expressed only in lung, thymus, and spleen. To determine lpB3 expression during embryonic development, we used in situ hybridization on E14 embryos (Fig. 2). Antisense probes detected highlpB3 expression in lung, kidney, intestine, diaphragm, submandibular gland, olfactory epithelium, choroid plexus, the cartilage primordium of ribs and clavicle, and the presumptive cartilaginous regions of lips (lower and upper) and snout regions but, as we found with adults, not in liver (Fig. 2 A). The corresponding sense strand probe was used as a negative control and did not show any specific labeling (Fig. 2 B). The different levels of lpB3 expression found when comparing the Northern blot versus the in situhybridization results might reflect changing expression levels during mouse development; note lpB3 expression level in embryonic heart (low) versus expression level in 8-week-old adult heart (high). The genomic structure of lpB3 consists of two exons, with the entire ORF encoded in the second exon (Fig.3 A and data not shown). The entire ORF was deleted in R1 ES cells using the Cre-loxP system (13Marth J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which allows for the removal of selectable enzyme marker genes and their associated constitutive promotors (this is the constitutive “type I” deletion) (Fig.3 A). In a similar manner, we also produced ES cells with the conditional “type II” deletion, in which the ORF is flanked byloxP sites (Fig. 3 A). Only the type I ES cells (Fig. 3 B, left) were injected into blastocysts, and a series of mice with mutated alleles (lpB3+/− orlpB3−/−) was established (Fig. 3,B (right) and C). The complete absence of lpB3 transcripts in the knockout mice was confirmed both by Northern blot analysis on adult tissues in whichlpB3 is normally expressed: brain, heart, and lung (Fig. 3 D) and in situ hybridization on E14 embryos (Fig. 2 C). There was moderatelpB3 expression in heterozygous tissues (Fig.3 D). In most of those tissues, the other S1P receptor genes (lpB1, lpB2,lpB4, and lpC1) and an LPA receptor gene (lpA1) were also expressed. LPB3 deficiency appeared to lead to compensatory increases in lpB2 expression levels in brain and heart but not in lung, uterus, or testis, whereas no compensatory increases were found in the other gene expression levels (Fig. 3 D and data not shown). LPB2 protein expression could not be addressed in those tissues because specific anti-LPB2 antibodies to detect mouse LPB2 protein are not available. The complete absence of LPB3 protein in the knockout mice was confirmed by Western blot analysis on the crude membrane fractions isolated from heart and lung (Fig. 3 E). Both anti-LPB3antibodies (directed against either the carboxyl or amino terminus) detected a ∼50-kDa protein in the wild-type but not in knockout mouse tissues. The molecular weight of the LPB3 protein estimated from mouse lpB3 sequences is 42.3 kDa. The difference between our results and the estimated molecular weights may result from the sample not being heated for denaturation before gel fractionation (see “Experimental Procedures”) and might explain the slower migration of the receptor protein. In addition, the size difference may reflect possible posttranslational modification of the receptor protein such as extracellular amino terminus glycosylation and intracellular carboxyl terminus palmitoylation (9Zhang G. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). LPB3-null mice were generally obtained at the expected Mendelian frequency and without sexual bias (χ2test; Table I). Homozygous-null matings produced LPB3-null pups, although the average litter size was modestly but significantly smaller (p < 0.01) than the size from the crosses between heterozygous males and wild-type females (5.6 versus 7.5 pups per litter). Knockout mice did not differ from the wild-type or heterozygous littermates in overall health, body weight, fertility, or longevity (through at least 18 months). During embryonic stages, the knockout mice were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates (data now shown). Routine histology that examined tissues from mice of age 10 days, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks (brain, heart, lung, thymus, liver, kidney, spleen, adipose tissues, skin, muscle, stomach, intestine, uterus, and testis) revealed no obvious abnormality (data not shown). Also, routine hematology including erythrocyte, leukocyte, and platelet counts; neutrophil, lympohocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil proportions; and glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride serum levels as well as lipase activity failed to detect any abnormalities or differences in the knockout versus wild-type mice (data not shown). DespitelpB3 expression in adult skin (Fig. 1), the knockout mice were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates in thickness of epidermal layers and numbers of hair follicles (data not shown). To determine the contribution of lpB3 to S1P signaling, we utilized MEF cells derived from E14 embryos to analyze S1P-induced signal transduction pathways. Wild-type MEF cells expressedlpB1, lpB2, andlpB3 but neither lpB4 norlpC1 at levels detectable by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). As expected, LPB3-null MEF cells lacked lpB3expression. LPB3 deficiency did not lead to compensatory increases in the expression of other S1P receptor genes in the knockout MEF cells (Fig. 4). In various cell systems, LPB1 receptor has been shown to couple only to PTX-sensitive Gi/oproteins. In contrast, both LPB2 and LPB3receptor have been shown to couple to Gq, Gi/o, and G12/13 proteins (reviewed in Refs. 6Fukushima N. Ishii I. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Therefore, we analyzed S1P induction of downstream events activated by these types of G proteins including PLC activation, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activation, and Rho activation. MEF cells prelabeled with [3H]inositol were stimulated with various concentrations of S1P for 20 min, and the radioactivity in inositol phosphate fractions was measured. S1P activated PLC in the wild-type cells in a concentration-dependent manner, giving a marked stimulation at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 μm (Fig.5 A, left). In contrast, S1P treatment led to o"

Akt activity is up-regulated in Src-transformed cells and is activated by v-Src in a coexpression system in both insect Sf9 cells and mammalian cells (11Datta K. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5385-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which these tyrosine kinases regulate Akt activity is not understood yet. Since tyrosine phosphorylation of Thr/Ser kinases such as PKCs has been reported to be important for its activation (13Li W. Mischak H., Yu, J.C. Wang L.M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J.

Here, we present evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt is required for Akt activation in response to growth factors. Mutation of two tyrosine residues near the activation loop of Akt completely abolishes its kinase activity induced by growth factors. Interestingly, these two tyrosine residues are conserved in many Ser/Thr kinases, and phosphorylation of the corresponding residues Tyr512 and Tyr523 in PKCδ has been shown to be critical for PKCδ activation in response to H2O2 (14Konishi H.

Phosphorylation of both c-Src and its substrates was detected by autoradiography (top panel). PP2 was added in one sample to further corroborate that the detected phosphorylation resulted from Src kinase activity. The amount of the substrate in each reaction was monitored by Coomassie Blue staining shown in the bottom panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The transfected cells were lysed in the buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton-X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupetin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonly fluoride). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and antibodies were added to lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were collected with protein A- and protein G (1:1)-Sepharose beads, and protein complexes were washed three times at 4 °C with the lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were divided equally into two aliquots: one for kinase assay and the other for Western blot. The Akt immunoprecipitates were resuspended in nonreducing SDS sample buffer, which will minimize the interference of IgG, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (17Chen R. Kim O. Li M. Xiong X. Guan J. Kung H. Chen H. Shimizu Y. Qiu Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Akt in vitro kinase assays were performed as reported by Franke et al. (15Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-HA immunoprecipitates were washed twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The immune complex was then incubated at room temperature for 15 min in 30 µl of the kinase buffer with 0.1 µg/ml histone 2B, 2 µm ATP, and 10 µci of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After the gels were dried, the phosphorylation of histone-H2B was visualized by autoradiography. For measurement of endogenous Akt activity, equivalent amounts of protein (determined by Bradford assay) were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKB/Akt antibody prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads, and kinase assays were carried out according to the instruction manual of the Akt Kinase Assay Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). GSK-3 fusion protein was used as a substrate for PKB/Akt. The phosphorylated GSK-3 was detected by Western blot using phospho-GSK-3 (Ser 21/9) antibody. Src in vitro kinase assays were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). 293 cells grown in a 12-well plate were transfected with 3XIRS (a luciferase reporter under the control of triple insulin-responsive sequence), empty vector, or FKHR expression plasmid and HA-tagged Akt or its mutants. Luciferase assays were performed as reported previously (18Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

At 24 h posttransfection, MDCK cells were detached by using trypsin/EDTA, washed, and resuspended with DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained in suspension in poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEMA)-coated 100-mm Petri dished. Coating was carried out with two rounds of 0.24 mg/ml poly-HEMA in ethanol and subsequent washing with DMEM. MDCK cells were kept in suspension for 12 h (19Rytomaa M. Lehmann K. Downward J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The cells were then stained by Annexin V-PE (PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's procedure and the number of Annexin V-positive and GFP-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. The number of the apoptotic cells was normalized with the transfection efficiency for each sample. Treatment of COS1 and prostate cancer cell line PC3M with EGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt, which is correlated with increased Akt kinase activity (Fig.1 a). The effect of EGF is inhibited by PP2, a selective inhibitor for Src family tyrosine kinases. Similar observations are obtained in COS1 cells transiently expressing HA-tagged Akt (Fig. 1 b), while MAPK activity induced by EGF is not affected by PP2. We also examined the endogenous Akt activity in v-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig.1 c, accompanied by its tyrosine phosphorylation, Akt kinase activity is dramatically increased in v-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells in comparison with the parental cell line. These results prompted us to examine Akt activation in response to growth factors in SYF, a cell line lacking Src, Yes, and Fyn (20Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1 d, treatment of SYF cells with 5 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor or 50 ng/ml EGF failed to stimulate endogenous Akt activity. Akt activity is restored by introducing wild-type c-Src but not kinase-inactive Src (SrcKD), back to these cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Src family tyrosine kinases may enhance Akt activation by a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. To further demonstrate that Src kinases may directly regulate Akt activity, we tested whether Src is able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt in a cotransfection experiment. As shown in Fig.2 a, HA-tagged Akt is highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in the presence of a constitutively active Src (Src527F) but not kinase-inactive Src (Src-KD). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt is correlated with its increased kinase activity, evidenced by in vitro kinase assays using histone 2B as a substrate. Akt activity induced by Src is inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, although the tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt remains unchanged. This is in agreement with previous observations that PI 3-kinase activity is required for Akt activation and that Src can up-regulate PI 3-kinase activity (11Datta K. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O.

However, in SYF cells, Src527F can still significantly enhance the kinase activity of a membrane-bound myristoylated Akt (myr-Akt) without affecting the phosphorylation of Thr308 (Fig.2 b), while a constitutively active PI 3-kinase p110CAAX has little effect on the kinase activity of myr-Akt, which is consistent with the previous observation that the activity of myr-Akt is independent of PI 3-kinase (22Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility that Src527F may regulate Akt activity through additional mechanism(s) in which PI 3-kinase is not involved and most likely by directly phosphorylating Akt. To define the potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites on Akt induced by Src, we were particularly interested in looking for those highly conserved tyrosine residues near the activation loop or C-terminal regulatory region. These tyrosine residues are often subjected to regulation by phosphorylation and more likely play a critical role in regulation of this highly conserved kinase family. Alignment of the subdomains VII and VIII of the kinase domains of Akt family from several organisms revealed three evolutionarily conserved tyrosine residues Tyr315, Tyr326, and Tyr340, which are close to the activation loop of Akt kinases (Fig. 2 c). To test whether these tyrosine residues are important for regulation of Akt activity, we substituted these residues with phenylalanines. As shown in Fig. 2 d, while mutation of Tyr340 has little effect on either tyrosine phosphorylation or kinase activity of Akt induced by Src527F, substitution of Tyr315 or Tyr326 with a phenylalanine, respectively, dramatically reduces both the tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of Akt. The combination of these two mutations abolishes Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt as well as its kinase activity. Similar results are obtained when we examine the effect of EGF on these mutants in COS1 cells (Fig.2 e). Interestingly, EGF-induced phosphorylation of Thr308 of all these YF mutants is largely unaffected, suggesting that the phenylalanine substitution has not perturbed the local conformation of the kinase domain. The lack of Akt kinase activity in the double mutant is more likely due to loss of tyrosine phosphorylation, which may be required for kinase activation. This is further corroborated by our data from the following in vitrokinase assays. As shown in Fig. 2 f, treatment of tyrosine-phosphorylated Akt with a phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatase PTPβ reduced both the tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of Akt, while phosphorylation of Thr308 remains unchanged. Furthermore, purified c-Src can induce phosphorylation of purified kinase-inactive GST-Akt-KM, and this phosphorylation is inhibited by PP2 (Fig. 2 g). However, the mutant Akt carrying 315F/326F mutations (GST-Akt-KM/315F/326F) can no longer be phosphorylated. Taken together, these data indicate that Akt is a direct substrate of Src both in vivo and in vitro and that tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt is essential for its full activation by growth factors. To address whether tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt is required for its biological function, we first examined the effects of the Akt mutants carrying mutations at these tyrosine residues on the activity of Forkhead transcription factor, which is phosphorylated and negatively regulated by Akt in many cell types (18Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 23Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S.

Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3a, cotransfection of wild-type Akt with FKHR into 293 cells inhibits FKHR transcription activity measured by the luciferase activity under the control of a promoter containing the FKHR recognition motif IRS. AktY326F has little effect on FKHR transcription activity, which is correlated with its poor kinase activity. The mutant AktY315F/Y326F and kinase-inactive mutant Akt-KM show strong dominant-negative effects on endogenous Akt and enhance FKHR transcription activity, consistent with complete loss of kinase activity in these mutants. The stronger inhibition by the double mutant over Akt-KM is possibly due to a slightly higher expression level of AktY315F/Y326F than Akt-KM. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt is required for inhibition of FKHR transcription activity. Since one of biological consequences of inhibiting FKHR is to promote cell survival, we next examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt is required for its anti-apoptotic effect. Fig. 3 b shows that about 42% MDCK cells undergo apoptosis upon detachment from matrix as evidenced by increased Annexin V staining and activation of caspase-3. Overexpression of a constitutively active myristoylated Akt (myr-Akt) significantly reduces cell death to 26%, in agreement with previous studies (19Rytomaa M. Lehmann K. Downward J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, myr-AktY315F/Y326F fails to block the cell death and renders more than 50% of the cells susceptible to detachment induced apoptosis. Therefore, the integrity of these two tyrosine residues seems to be important for Akt's anti-apoptotic function. As another functional assay for Akt, we examined the effect of myr-Akt and its derivative on the growth of MDCK cells. Overexpression of myr-Akt results in enhanced proliferation of MDCK cells, while myr-AktY315F/Y326F has a dominant-negative effect on cell growth (data not shown). Our data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt may be critical for its biological functions. In general, phosphorylation plays an essential role in regulation of the function of virtually all kinases. With no exception, Akt is also regulated by several phosphorylation events. In this report, we demonstrated that, in addition to phosphorylation of Thr308and Ser473, tyrosine phosphorylation may also play an important role in regulation of Akt activity. This notion is supported by our observation that EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of Akt are both blocked by a Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 in several cell lines tested as well as in SYF cells, and activation of Akt in response to EGF (50 ng/ml) or platelet-derived growth factor (5 ng/ml) is severely impaired and can be restored by cotransfection with c-Src but not kinase-inactive Src. These data suggest that Src family kinases may be required for Akt activation in response to growth factors in these cells. This is corroborated by our observation that Src527F can further enhance the kinase activity of myr-Akt, which is shown to be independent of PI 3-kinase. We also identified two tyrosine residues Tyr315 and Tyr326, which can be phosphorylated by Src both in vivo and in vitro. The substitution of these two tyrosine residues with phenylalanines renders Akt's loss of both tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity in response to growth factors. As a consequence, these Akt mutants can no longer inhibit their downstream target FKHR transcription activity and fail to promote cell survival. In this study, we demonstrated that the tyrosine kinase Src is able to phosphorylate Akt both in vivo and in vitro; therefore, Src family kinases may directly regulate Akt activity through a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner rather than solely depends on activation of PI 3-kinase as suggested previously. Tyr315 lies in the activation loop, and phosphorylation of this residue may have a similar impact on the conformation of the kinase domain as that of Thr308 to open up the activation loop, hence resembling the mode of MAPK activation, which requires phosphorylation of both Thr202and Thr204 (25Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Tyr326 is closed to subdomain VIII and more likely involved in stabilizing the substrate. Based on the fact that several residues preceding to Tyr326 are predominantly negative charge amino acids, and the preferred substrates for Akt all carry positively charged RXRXXS motifs, it is possible that phosphorylation of Tyr326 will allow the kinase form a more stable complex with its substrate(s) and enhance its catalytic activity. It is likely that other tyrosine kinases such as Syk or Btk family kinases may also be involved in Akt phosphorylation in different cell contexts or responding to different stimuli, since lack of B cell antigen receptor-mediated activation of Akt in Syk−/− or Btk−/− B lymphocytes has also been reported (7Li H.L. Davis W.W. Whiteman E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Pure E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6890-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Craxton A. Jiang A. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30644-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Given that these two tyrosine residues are highly conserved among all Akt isoforms, we anticipate that such regulation may also be applicable to other Akt isoforms. It is noteworthy that these two tyrosine residues are conserved in about 50% of Ser/Thr kinases, and phosphorylation of the corresponding residues Tyr512 and Tyr523 in PKCδ has been shown to be critical for PKCδ activation in response to H2O2 (14Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of these two tyrosine residues may be a general mechanism by which these kinases are regulated. The level of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of these kinases may depend on cell contexts and likely be affected by the content of tyrosine phosphotase(s). Our preliminary data show that phosphotyrosine is detectable after alkali treatment by two-dimentional electrophoretic analysis ofin vivo 32Pi-labeled Akt purified from EGF-treated COS1 cells (data not shown). Our current model for activation of Akt in response to growth factors is that multiple upstream events are required for Akt to achieve fully activated and biologically functional including: 1) translocation to the plasma membrane by binding to PI 3-kinase generated phospholipids, 2) phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473, and 3) phosphorylation of Tyr315 and Tyr326. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation and threonine/serine phosphorylation appear to be independent events, since AktY315F/Y326F is still phosphorylated at Thr308 and AktT308A/S473A is also tyrosine-phosphorylated (data not shown). Our data suggest that, in addition to phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473, tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt may be required for its full activation and biological functions. The mechanisms by which extracellular stimuli regulate Akt activity are actually far more complex than we previously thought and appear to be controlled by more than the PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway(s). We anticipate that more factors involved in regulation of Akt will be discovered in the future.

In the current study, we show an unexpectedly severe hyperlipidemia in ob/ob mice on a background of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) deficiency (−/−). Doubly mutant mice (LDLR−/−;ob/ob) exhibited striking elevations in both total plasma cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels (1715 ± 87 and 1016 ± 172 mg/dl, respectively), at age 3–4 months, resulting in extensive atherosclerotic lesions throughout the aorta by 6 months. Lipoprotein analyses revealed the elevated TC and TG levels to be due to a large increase in an apoB-containing broad-β remnant lipoprotein fraction. While fasting, diet restriction, and low level leptin treatment significantly lowered TG levels, they caused only slight changes in TC levels. Hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride contents as well as mRNA levels of cholesterologenic and lipogenic enzymes suggest that leptin deficiency increased hepatic triglyceride production but did not change cholesterol production in ob/ob mice regardless of their LDLR genotype. These data provide evidence that the hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia in the doubly mutant mice are caused by distinct mechanisms and point to the possibility that leptin might have some impact on plasma cholesterol metabolism, possibly through an LDLR-independent pathway. This model will be an excellent tool for future studies on the relationship between impaired fuel metabolism, increased plasma remnant lipoproteins, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.

Although many human patients present with varying combinations of these risk factors, most animal models produced to date have focused on only one or two and their effects on atherogenesis. Leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob)1 are an excellent murine model for obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes, all of which are components of a multiple risk factor syndrome that, along with hypercholesterolemia, precipitates a potential high risk for atherosclerosis (1Coleman D.L. Diabetologia. 1978; 14: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 2Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffel M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11755) Google Scholar). These mice also have fatty livers, presumably due to hepatic overproduction of triglycerides, reflecting an imbalanced energy metabolism. However, they show only a modest increase in plasma triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels (3Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and thus do not develop atherosclerosis on a regular chow diet as shown in the current study. It has been reported that ob/ob mice might have an impaired secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (4Li X. Grundy S.M. Patel S.B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1277-1288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, extensive studies on apoB-containing lipoprotein metabolism in these mice have not been undertaken. Remnant lipoprotein particles are the apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins that remain in the circulation after hepatic VLDL and intestinal chylomicrons are lipolyzed. They include lipoproteins in the size range of VLDL, intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), and low density lipoproteins (LDL). Remnant particles can exist in individuals in a normolipidemic state, especially postprandially, but are generally processed by lipoprotein lipase and quickly cleared from plasma. However, the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that are increased in diabetic patients as well as cholesterol-rich remnants referred to as β-VLDL that are found in patients with type III hyperlipidemia are also remnant lipoproteins and in these cases are known to be atherogenic. Several mouse models of chronically increased remnant lipoproteins have recently been created by targeted disruption of genes that are crucial in lipoprotein metabolism. These include apoE-deficient mice (5Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setälä K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar, 6Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar), LDL receptor-deficient mice on a high fat diet (7Ishibashi S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Herz J. Burns D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), and LDLR/LDLR-related protein (LRP) double knockout mice (8Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), confirming the importance of apoE as a ligand and LDLR and LRP as receptors for plasma remnant clearance. Recently, it was reported that disruption of the LDLR gene unmasked severe hyperlipidemia with increased remnant particles in sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1a transgenic mice (TgSREBP-1a;LDLR−/−), providing another model for studying the effects of excessive remnant lipoproteins in plasma (9Horton J.D. Shimano H. Hamilton R.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this model, hepatic overexpression of nuclear SREBP-1a, a potent transcription activator for both cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis, caused overproduction of lipids and large VLDL in the liver. Normally, these large particles can be taken up by the LDLR very efficiently, which prevented the development of hyperlipidemia in the TgSREBP-1a mice; however, in the absence of the LDLR, remnant lipoproteins accumulated in plasma, providing support for the importance of the LDLR in remnant clearance. The TgSREBP-1a;LDLR−/− mouse model is different from other hyperlipidemic animal models because hepatic lipid overproduction, rather than simply a lack of lipoprotein clearance, contributes to the pathological mechanism. This observation prompted us to study the metabolic consequences of hepatic triglyceride overproduction as seen in ob/ob mice, on the background of a state of impaired remnant clearance. We sought to analyze the effects of leptin deficiency on remnant lipoprotein metabolism by producing mice that were deficient in both leptin and the LDLR (LDLR−/−;ob/ob). These doubly mutant mice showed extreme elevations in both plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels and also had extensive atherosclerotic lesions throughout the aorta. While fasting, diet restriction, and low level leptin treatment of LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice significantly lowered TG levels, they caused only slight changes in total plasma cholesterol (TC) levels. This model supports the idea that a relationship exists between energy imbalance/hepatic overproduction of triglycerides and plasma remnant accumulation during impaired lipoprotein clearance. LDLR(−/−) mice (10Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) were back-crossed onto a C57Bl/6 background to the 10th generation. ob/+ mice on a C57Bl/6 background were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and were also maintained in our colonies. To obtain leptin deficient (ob/ob) on a background of LDLR deficiency, ob/+ mice were crossed with LDLR(−/−) mice, and the F1 progeny of these matings (LDLR+/−;ob/+) were then crossed to obtain mice that had either zero, one, or both normal LDLR alleles and were leptin-deficient (LDLR−/−;ob/ob, LDLR+/−;ob/ob, and LDLR+/+;ob/ob, respectively) as well as control LDLR(−/−), LDLR(+/−), and wild type mice. Male and female mice were caged separately, and data was combined for all experiments, since no gender difference was noted. Mice were maintained and cared for according to the regulations of the Tokyo University Animal Care Committee. Mice were kept in microisolator cages with 12-h light/dark cycles and were fed ad libitum except during food restriction procedures. All mice were fed a normal rodent chow diet containing 0.075% cholesterol (MF; Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan)). A cholesterol-free diet was also purchased from Oriental Yeast Co. and fed to mice ad libitum for the cholesterol-free diet studies. For caloric restriction, mice were given 1.6 g of normal chow diet per day, and control age-matched mice were fed ad libitum. Blood collections were performed via optical venous plexus puncture with EDTA-treated tubes. Collections were performed between 10 and 12 a.m. on animals fedad libitum. Samples were preserved with EDTA and NaN3. Plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol levels were measured with colorimetric assays by Determiner TC555, TG555, and HDL-C (Kyowa Medex, Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Glucose was measured by a standard enzymatic method. Insulin levels were tested with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit by LABIS (Japan) for mouse insulin. For analysis of lipoprotein distribution, pooled plasma samples from three mice per group were subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (SRL, Japan). Estimation of HDL levels in some samples were obtained from HPLC plots by calculation of the area under the curve. Agarose gel electrophoresis for lipoproteins was performed per standard protocol on gels purchased from Ciba/Corning. Livers were immediately collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. A 50-mg piece of liver was homogenized in PBS. Folch's reagent (CHCl3/MeOH, 2:1) (0.75 ml) was added to the homogenate. The nonaqueous phase was collected, and 30 μl of 200 mg/ml Triton X-100 in CHCl3 was added. Samples were dried and used for cholesterol and triglyceride analysis as described above for plasma samples. Total RNA was prepared from the snap frozen livers with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA (12 μg) was electrophoresed through formalin-denatured agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA probes were prepared as described (11Shimano H.

Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Megaprime DNA Labeling System kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled probes in Rapid-hyb Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Membranes were exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. XAR-5 film for 2–5 h at −80 °C. Lipoprotein lipase measurements in postheparin plasma (10 min after intravenous injection of 0.1 mg/Kg heparin) were performed using a modification of the standard technique by Muir (21Muir J.R. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 17: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Leptin was purchased from Calbiochem and was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Leptin was diluted in PBS for individual mice according to their weight, and 0.3 μg/g body weight was injected in 100-μl doses per day. Whole aortae were collected and stained with Sudan IV as described (7Ishibashi S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Herz J. Burns D.K. J. Clin.

Blood was collected from wild type, LDLR(−/−), LDLR(+/−), LDLR+/+;ob/ob, LDLR+/−;ob/ob, and LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice that were 3–4 months of age. Plasma was analyzed for TG and TC levels (Table I). LDLR+/+;ob/ob mice had slightly elevated TC levels (119 ± 25 mg/dl), as was previously reported (3Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). LDLR+/−;ob/ob mice showed a significant elevation in TC levels to 282 ± 29 mg/dl with no increase in TG levels; however, the LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice showed a dramatic increase in TC levels with an average of 1715 ± 87 mg/dl with values ranging from 1430 to 2030 mg/dl.

TC and TG (mg/dl) of 3–4-month-old mice were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are given as the mean ± S.E. Since well known phenotypes of ob/ob mice such as obesity, increased plasma glucose, and insulin levels are age-dependent, a time course study of TC and TG levels from additional animals was performed (Fig. 1). At 1 month (upon weaning), the LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice already displayed modest elevations in both TC and TG levels (369 ± 20 mg/dl and 137 ± 26 mg/dl, respectively; n = 6). These values increased significantly to 716 ± 48 and 393 ± 97 after mice were placed on a normal diet for 2 weeks. The LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice showed an age-dependent increase in TC and TG levels between 1 and 4 months, with values becoming maximal at 3–4 months, followed by a gradual decrease to 585 ± 44 and 306 ± 36 mg/dl (n = 3) by 8 months. LDLR+/−;ob/ob mice also showed a similar pattern of reaching peak TC levels at 3–4 months of age and maintained stable TC levels of ∼280 mg/dl thereafter. TG levels in LDLR+/−;ob/ob mice were not different from wild type animals at any time (Fig. 1). HDL levels in all groups of mice were estimated from HPLC results and remained unchanged over the course of the study. Wild type mice had HDL levels of 54 mg/dl at 3 months and 47 mg/dl at 8 months. LDLR(−/−) HDLs were slightly elevated to 69 and 65 mg/dl at 3 and 8 months. LDLR+/+;ob/ob mice were 89 and 56 mg/dl, LDLR+/−;ob/ob were 69 and 62 mg/dl, and LDLR−/−;ob/ob had levels of 90 and 94 mg/dl at 3 and 8 months, respectively. Glucose levels in LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice were ∼200 mg/dl at 2 months and rose to between 300 and 400 mg/dl from 2 to 7 months. There were no significant differences between LDLR−/−;ob/ob and LDLR+/−;ob/ob mice during the study (data not shown). Insulin levels in LDLR−/−;ob/ob and LDLR+/−;ob/ob mice rose steadily from ∼30 to ∼300 ng/ml blood between 1 and 7 months (data not shown). Plasma samples from 12–16-week-old mice were further analyzed for the distribution of lipoproteins (Fig.2). As expected, wild type mouse plasma contained primarily HDL-sized lipoproteins. LDLR+/+;ob/ob mice showed a unique profile containing mostly HDL with a shoulder on the HDL peak with particles sized between LDL and HDL, as has been recently described (15Silver D.L. Jiang X.-C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4140-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This peak most likely contains HDL1 particles and will be referred to as such. LDLR(−/−) mice displayed elevated levels of LDL, similar to previous reports (10Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). The distribution of lipoproteins in LDLR+/−;ob/ob mice was similar to the LDLR+/+;ob/ob mice except that the HDL1 peak was higher and broader. In contrast, plasma from LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice contained a severely elevated and broadened lipoprotein peak ranging from VLDL/IDL-sized particles to LDL-sized particles, presumably remnant lipoproteins, and retained HDL levels similar to wild type animals. Further analysis of lipoprotein profiles was performed by lipoprotein-agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown). As expected, LDLR+/+;ob/ob mouse plasma had a pattern similar to wild type mice, although the α-band was slightly broader, presumably due to the HDL1 particles. Interestingly, LDLR+/−;ob/ob mice had both α and β migrating particles, and LDLR−/−;ob/ob plasma contained a broad β-migrating band similar to that seen from apoE(−/−) lipoproteins. Whole lipoprotein fractions (d < 1.21) were separated from pooled plasma samples of each group (n = 3) and were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to analyze apoproteins (Fig. 3). LDLR(−/−) mice had elevated apoB-100 levels as compared with wild type mice (lanes 1 and 2). LDLR+/+;ob/ob mouse plasma contained barely detectable apoBs (lane 3); however, LDLR+/−;ob/ob plasma did have apoB-100 and low levels of B-48 (lane 4). The amounts of apoBs in these groups were consistent with their LDL peaks in the HPLC. In striking contrast, the LDLR−/−;ob/ob lipoproteins consisted of highly elevated levels of both apoB-100 and apoB-48, with a greater ratio of B-100 to B-48 particles (lane 5), indicating that their elevated TC and TG levels may be at least partially due to an increase in particle number. In addition, the LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice had an apparent increase in apoAIV and apoE. This is probably due to the increased remnant lipoproteins. In comparison, apoE(−/−) mouse lipoproteins are enriched in apoAIV, and LDLR(−/−) mice on a high fat diet show increases in apoE (7Ishibashi S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Herz J. Burns D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein lipase activities were measured in pooled samples from mice to determine if lipolytic activity was decreased in the LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice. Postheparin lipolytic activity for wild type mice was 0.45 μmol of FFA/ml/min. LDLR(−/−), LDLR+/+;ob/ob, and LDLR−/−;ob/ob all had slightly elevated lipolytic activity (0.61, 0.72, and 0.57 μmol of FFA/ml/min). To determine if the increased plasma TC and TG in the LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice was related to hepatic cholesterologenic and lipogenic enzymes, livers were collected from 6-month-old animals and analyzed for both cholesterol and triglyceride content as well as various enzyme RNA levels. The livers of LDLR(−/−) mice as well as all three ob/ob groups were found to contain slightly, but significantly, higher levels of cholesterol than wild type mice (Table II), which is consistent with previous reports (9Horton J.D. Shimano H. Hamilton R.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice contained slightly higher levels of cholesterol than the other two ob/ob groups and the LDLR(−/−) mice (p < 0.05) (Table II). Triglyceride levels were ∼10 times higher in the three ob/ob groups compared with the wild type and LDLR(−/−) mice, but there was no association between LDLR genotype and liver triglyceride content in the ob/ob mice. These data indicate that leptin deficiency causes a marked increase in liver triglyceride levels but only a small increase in liver cholesterol content.Table IILiver cholesterol and triglyceride contentGenotypeCholesterol content2-ap < 0.05 wild type versus all other groups; LDLR(−/−) versus LDLR−/−;ob/ob.Triglyceride content2-bp < 0.005 wild type and LDLR(−/−) versus all ob/ob groups.mg/g of liverWild type1.77 ± 0.3227.0 ± 5.2LDLR(−/−)2.91 ± 0.2224.2 ± 3.3LDLR+/+;ob/ob4.13 ± 0.9244 ± 4.2LDLR+/−;ob/ob3.45 ± 0.1222 ± 40LDLR−/−;ob/ob5.01 ± 0.5278 ± 40Liver cholesterol and triglyceride content was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For all groups, n= 3.

Open table in a new tab Liver cholesterol and triglyceride content was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For all groups, n= 3. Values are given as mean ± S.E. in mg/g of liver. Northern blot analyses on liver RNAs revealed that cholesterologenic enzymes HMG-CoA synthase (Fig.4), HMG-CoA reductase and SREBP-2 (data not shown), were unchanged among all five groups. In contrast, lipogenic enzyme RNAs (SREBP-1, fatty acid synthase, ATP citrate lyase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1) were increased in the ob/ob groups compared with wild type and LDLR(−/−); however, there was very little difference in the ob/ob mice between the three LDLR genotypes. ApoAI was slightly decreased in ob/ob mice; however, apoAII, and apoE RNA levels were unchanged in the ob/ob mice compared with controls. A control probe for the ribosomal enzyme 36B4 demonstrates equal loading (Fig. 4). To determine the possible mechanism by which lipoproteins become elevated in the LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice, initial studies were focused on the possibility that the increased caloric intake of ob/ob mice was overwhelming and surpassed backup lipoprotein clearance systems when the LDLR was not present. To test this hypothesis, LDLR+/−;ob/ob and LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice were fasted for 2 days, after which glucose, TC, and TG levels were analyzed (n = 3 in each group). Glucose levels were reduced by 57 and 44% in LDLR+/−;ob/ob and LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice, respectively. Furthermore, TG levels fell by 58 and 53%, respectively, in the fasted mice. In contrast, TC levels increased slightly (although not significantly; p = 0.12) in the LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice from 585 ± 44 to 712 ± 47 mg/dl, while TC levels in the LDLR+/−;ob/ob mice were unchanged (265 ± 14 to 244 ± 12 mg/dl). These data are consistent with the faster turnover rate of fatty acids and triglycerides than cholesterol. Following this short term fasting experiment, a long term caloric restriction diet, in which 4-week-old LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice were given only 50% of what a wild type mouse would consume, was initiated. Both diet-restricted mice (n = 2) and mice fed ad libitum (n = 3) showed a significant increase in TC over the 2-week study, confirming the age-dependent increase in TC; however, this increase was more drastic in the mice fedad libitum, so that after 2 weeks there was a significant difference in TC levels between the two groups (Fig.5). TG levels increased significantly in the control group but remained unchanged in the diet-restricted group (Fig. 5), a pattern that paralleled changes in glucose levels in the mice (data not shown). There was a slight reduction in HDL levels in both control and diet-restricted LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice (92 ± 35 to 89 ± 28 and 90 ± 35 to 79 ± 32, respectively); however, there were no significant differences, reflecting the smaller contribution of HDL to the hyperlipidemia in these mice. Based on these studies, while the elevated TG levels in the LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice were basically associated with the amount of short term food consumption, the increased caloric intake of these mice, due to their leptin deficiency, cannot account for the elevations in TC levels. To determine whether the increase in TC levels was derived from the cholesterol that was present in the normal chow diet, these mice were placed on a cholesterol-free diet. After 2 weeks on the cholesterol-free diet, there were no detectable changes in TC (542 ± 20 to 560 ± 102 mg/dl) or TG levels (272 ± 19 to 281 ± 34 mg/dl) of LDLR−/−;ob/ob animals. HDL levels in LDLR−/− mice were unchanged by the cholesterol-free diet (83 ± 12 to 86 ± 13.5 mg/dl). HDL levels in LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice were decreased from 75 ± 5 to 65 ± 13 mg/dl; however, it was not statistically significant. Glucose levels were reduced by 29% in LDLR+/−;ob/ob and LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice. To determine whether the high plasma TC and TG levels observed in the LDLR−/−;ob/ob were reversible with leptin treatment, 6–8-week-old LDLR(−/−), LDLR+/−;ob/ob, and LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice were injected with a low dose of leptin (0.3 μg of leptin/g body weight) daily for 10 days. This low dose of leptin has been shown to be suboptimal for weight reduction so that body weight in the treated mice was not significantly changed by this treatment (15Silver D.L. Jiang X.-C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4140-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Control mice were injected daily with a similar volume of PBS. The LDLR(−/−) mice did not show any significant changes in TC, TG, or glucose levels (data not shown). Mice in all groups gained weight within the 10-day treatment (predictable from their age), but there were no significant differences due to the leptin treatment (TableIII). Insulin levels were typical of ob/ob mice of this age (20–30 ng/ml) throughout the study. Insulin levels in the PBS-treated mice increased during the treatment, while leptin treatment tended to retard this increase in both LDLR−/−;ob/ob and LDLR+/−;ob/ob groups, although there was no significant difference due to a high variability (data not shown). Glucose levels were slightly decreased in the leptin-treated LDLR−/−;ob/ob and LDLR+/−;ob/ob mice (Table III). TG levels were substantially decreased in the leptin-treated LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice, while they tended to be increased in the PBS-treated mice during the course of the study (TableIII). In contrast, TC levels in the leptin-treated LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice were only slightly reduced, whereas those of the PBS-treated LDLR−/−;ob/ob increased significantly (p < 0.05) during the course of the study (Table III). HPLC analyses of pooled serum samples from leptin and PBS-injected LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice are shown are Fig. 6. Leptin treatment caused a substantial decrease in the VLDL/IDL fraction compared with little change seen in the PBS-injected mice (data not shown). This noticeable shift from VLDL/IDL size particles to particles in the LDL size range is consistent with the marked reduction in TG and minimal decrease in TC detected from total serum. Interestingly, HDL levels appeared to increase upon leptin injection. The leptin-injected LDLR+/−;ob/ob mice also displayed a lowering in TG levels, which was concomitant with a reduction in the HDL1 peak compared with their base-line profile and with PBS-injected animals (data not shown). These data indicate that leptin treatment in LDLR−/−;ob/ob mice can revert their hypertriglyceridemia but not their hypercholesterolemia, since the remnant cholesterol was presumably converted to LDL cholesterol.Table IIIEffect of leptin treatment in LDLR−/−;ob/ob miceGroupControlLeptin-treatedBase line10 daysBase line10 daysLDLR+/−;ob/obBody weight (g)21 ± 330 ± 232.5 ± 636 ± 5Glucose (mg/dl)194 ± 26201 ± 31303 ± 41215 ± 67TG (mg/dl)84 ± 17193 ± 273-ap < 0.05 compared with base line.128 ± 17114 ± 42TC (mg/dl)2"

We re-examined the sequence alignments of these proteins with GPxs from higher eukaryotes. Sequence identities, particularly with phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases (PHGPxs), were enhanced markedly by introduction to the yeast sequences of gaps that are characteristic of PHGPxs. PHGPx-like activity was detectable in extracts from wild-type S. cerevisiae and was diminished in extracts from gpx1Δ, gpx2Δ, andgpx3Δ deletion mutants; PHGPx activity was almost absent in a gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ triple mutant. Studies with cloned GPX1, GPX2, andGPX3 expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli confirmed that these genes encode proteins with PHGPx activity. An S. cerevisiae gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ mutant was defective for growth in medium supplemented with the oxidation-sensitive polyunsaturated fatty acid linolenate (18:3). This sensitivity to 18:3 was more marked than sensitivity to H2O2. Unlike H2O2 toxicity, delayed toxicity of 18:3 towardgpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ cells was correlated with the gradual incorporation of 18:3 into S. cerevisiae membrane lipids and was suppressible with α-tocopherol, an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. The results show that the GPX genes of S. cerevisiae, previously reported to encode GPxs, encode PHGPxs (PHGPx1, PHGPx2, and PHGPx3) and that these enzymes protect yeast against phospholipid hydroperoxides as well as nonphospholipid peroxides during oxidative stress. This is the first report of an organism that expresses PHGPx from more than one gene and produces PHGPx in the absence of a GPx.

Reactive oxygen species are damaging to all cellular constituents including protein, DNA, and lipids. Hence, cells possess a range of nonenzymatic and enzymatic defense systems to counter oxidative stress including glutathione, thioredoxin, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidases such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which is commonly a selenoprotein (1Arthur J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1825-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxidases act by reducing hydroperoxides (e.g. H2O2). Many catalases do not react with larger hydroperoxides such as organictert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP),1 whereas glutathione peroxidases can act on both H2O2and the larger hydroperoxides. Moreover, the principal antioxidant enzymes for H2O2 detoxification are generally considered to be the glutathione peroxidases rather than catalase, because catalase has a much lower affinity than glutathione peroxidase for H2O2 (2Jacob H.S. Ingbar S.H. Jandl J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1965; 44: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Dawes I.W. Dickinson J.R. Schweizer M. The Metabolism and Physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Taylor & Francis, London1999: 277-326Google Scholar). Two principal forms of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) have been characterized in cells: classical GPx (cGPx or GPx) and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) (other forms are plasma GPx, epididymal GPx, and cytosolic gastrointestinal GPx) (1Arthur J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1825-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PHGPx is monomeric and partly membrane-associated, often evident in both soluble and membrane fractions, whereas GPx is tetrameric and soluble. Moreover, PHGPx is functionally distinct from GPx in that as well as the peroxides that are substrates of both enzymes, PHGPx reduces lipid hydroperoxides esterified to biomembranes. Phospholipid hydroperoxides are central intermediates in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction, lipid peroxidation being one of the major types of oxidative damage in cells, associated with membrane perturbation, inactivation of membrane proteins, and cell lysis. Lipid peroxidation has also been linked to pathological conditions such as ischemic injury, atherosclerosis, and carcinogenesis (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999Google Scholar). Thus, PHGPx is the principal cellular enzyme capable of membrane lipid peroxidation repair and is generally considered to be the main line of enzymatic defense against oxidative membrane damage (5Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohé L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar); GPx in cells may interfere with membrane lipid peroxidation only through concerted action with phospholipases (6van Kuijk F.J.G.M. Sevanian A. Handelman G.J. Dratz E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 7Chen J.-W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28421-28427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that PHGPx reduces nucleic acid and protein hydroperoxides and is involved in structural and cell-signaling functions (8Bao Y.P. Williamson G. Prog. Nat. Sci. 2000; 10: 321-330Google Scholar). Despite this, other GPxs seem more common than PHGPx with no organism previously shown to possess more than one gene encoding PHGPx. The experimental advantages of the yeast model Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been exploited extensively for advancing our understanding of cellular defenses against reactive oxygen species (for reviews see Refs. 3Dawes I.W. Dickinson J.R. Schweizer M. The Metabolism and Physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Taylor & Francis, London1999: 277-326Google Scholar and 9Santoro N. Thiele D.J. Hohmann S. Mager W.H.

Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Evans M.V. Turton H.E. Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 483-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the completion of the yeast genome sequence in 1996 revealed three open reading frames predicted to encode GPx-like proteins. Inoue et al. (14Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) recently undertook the first characterization of these ORFs, which encode a cysteine residue at the conserved active site position commonly occupied by selenocysteine in the GPxs of higher organisms. One of the ORFs was induced by glucose starvation and another by oxidative stress in a Yap1p-dependent manner. A triple-deletion mutant lacking all three ORFs was hypersensitive to H2O2 and t-BHP. Based principally on sequence analyses and observations of diminished activity againstt-BHP in the deletion mutants, these workers proposed that all three ORFs encoded (selenium-independent) glutathione peroxidases. The genes were named GPX1, GPX2, andGPX3. Here, we re-examine the sequence alignments of the GPXproducts with other GPxs and show that the yeast proteins in fact exhibit greater similarity to PHGPxs than to GPxs. Furthermore, our biochemical and physiological studies confirm that GPX1,GPX2, and GPX3 encode PHGPxs and that these enzymes are required for cellular protection against lipid peroxidation. Thus, S. cerevisiae becomes the first organism known to express PHGPx from more than one gene and the first shown to possess PHGPx in the absence of a GPx. The S. cerevisiae BY4741 (MAT a his3Δ1leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) and derivative single-deletion mutants gpx1Δ,gpx2Δ, gpx3Δ, ccp1Δ,ctt1Δ, tsa1Δ, sod1Δ, and sod2Δ were obtained from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany). Thegpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ triple mutant was constructed by short flanking homology polymerase chain reaction (15Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) using the URA3, His3MX6, andkanMX6 markers for gene disruption. For the preparation of cell extracts, organisms were cultured to mid/late exponential phase (A600 ∼ 1.0) in liquid YEPD medium as described previously (16Avery S.V. Howlett N.G. Radice S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3960-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and collected by centrifugation followed by two washes with 0.85% (w/v) NaCl. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.03 mm leupeptin) and disrupted with glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) by using a mini-bead beater (Biospec Products). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were retained for enzyme assays. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using the Bradford assay (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The full-length ORFs of GPX1 (YKL026c), GPX2(YBR244w), and GPX3 (YIR037w) were tagged withBamHI and XhoI sites (underlined below) during amplification by polymerase chain reaction using S. cerevisiae genomic DNA as template. The primers used were:GPX1, 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGCAAGAATTTTATTC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAAATCTGTTCTTCTGG-3′; GPX2, 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGACCACATCTTTT-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCATTTACTTAACAGG-3′; and GPX3, 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGTCAGAATTCTAT-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCTATTCCACCTCTTTC-3′. The amplified fragments were inserted between the BamHI andXhoI sites of the plasmid vector pET14b (Novagen) to give in-frame fusion with a His6 tag. Sequence fidelity of all products was routinely confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis. For experiments, recombinant plasmids were transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3), and ampicillin-resistant colonies were cultured in LBamp broth to anA600 of ∼0.6 before induction of recombinant proteins by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Two hours after induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), washed twice in 0.85% NaCl, and resuspended in lysis buffer. The cells were disrupted by three freeze-thaw cycles followed by sonication, and cell debris was sedimented by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using the Bradford assay (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Extracts were analyzed for the soluble recombinant protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using standard protocols (18Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001Crossref Google Scholar). To solubilize the GPX1 gene product, cell disruption was performed in lysis buffer supplemented with Triton X-100 (0.12% (v/v)). After the centrifugation of extracts as described above, the supernatant was retained, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with tergitol (Nonidet P-40, Sigma) at a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v) and then sonicated briefly. The His-tagged protein products of GPX2 and GPX3were purified from cell extracts according to manufacturer instructions using 1 ml of HiTrap chelating affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) charged with 0.1 m NiSO4. A separate column was used for each recombinant protein. The columns were equilibrated with 0.02 m sodium phosphate and 0.5m NaCl, pH 7.4, and washed with 0.02 m sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.05 m imidazole at pH 7.4. The purified proteins were eluted into ∼0.5-ml fractions with 0.02 m sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.5m imidazole at pH 7.4. Fractions containing the protein peaks (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) were assayed immediately for enzymatic activity. PHGPx reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding hydroxyphospholipids with simultaneous oxidation of NADPH that can be monitored in vitro with spectrophotometry (19Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 20Weitzel F. Ursini F. Wendel A. Biochim. Biophys.

The phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH) substrate was generated by the hydroperoxidation of phosphatidylcholine (Type III/S, Sigma) dispersions in deoxycholate using soybean lipoxygenase exactly as described by Ursini et al. (19Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) with the modifications of Weitzel et al. (20Weitzel F. Ursini F. Wendel A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1036: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PCOOH was purified by passage through Oasis HLB 3-cc cartridges (Water Associates, Milford, MA) with methanol elution (21Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activities in crude cell extracts or of purified recombinant protein were assayed in reaction buffer comprised of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmNaN3, 5 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm NADPH, 3 mm glutathione, 0.12% Triton X-100, and 2 units/ml glutathione reductase. Protein was added to 1-ml reaction final volumes, and after 3 min of equilibration with continuous stirring the reaction was started by the addition of PCOOH or t-BHP substrate according to standard protocols (20Weitzel F. Ursini F. Wendel A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1036: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidation was recorded spectrophotometrically as a linear change in absorbance at 340 nm between 3 and 5 min of incubation after the start of reactions. Rates of NADPH consumption were corrected for (a) glutathione-independent NADPH-oxidizing activity by omitting glutathione, (b) peroxide-independent NADPH-oxidizing activity by omitting substrate, and (c) nonenzymatic NADPH oxidizing activity by omitting protein. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of protein (extract) required to oxidize 1 μmol of NADPH/min at 25 °C. Where specified, the phospholipase inhibitors indomethacin and neomycin sulfate were added 5 min prior to the addition of substrate to final concentrations of 200 and 100 μm, respectively. Organisms were cultured to mid/late exponential phase (A600 ∼ 2.0) in liquid YEPD medium. For spotting experiments, the cultures were adjusted toA600 values of ∼2.5, 0.25, 0.025, 0.0025, and 0.00025 for each strain. Samples (4-μl) from each dilution were spotted on YEPD agar, supplemented with filter-sterilized linolenic acid (18:3), or H2O2 as specified. For all experiments involving 18:3, medium was prepared with tergitol to solubilize fatty acids; the final tergitol concentration was 1% (w/v). The control medium and H2O2-supplemented medium were also supplemented with tergitol, which has no adverse effect on yeast growth (16Avery S.V. Howlett N.G. Radice S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3960-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments in YEPD liquid medium (supplemented as above), the cells were suspended to anA600 of ∼0.2 and incubated with shaking (120 rev min−1) as described previously (16Avery S.V. Howlett N.G. Radice S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3960-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where specified, cultures were supplemented with α-tocopherol (200 μm) 30 min prior to the exposure of cells to 18:3 or H2O2. Colony-forming units were determined after appropriate dilution and incubation on YEPD agar for 4 days at 30 °C. Inoue et al. (14Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) based their initial identification of the open reading frames YKL026c, YBR244w, and YIR037w as glutathione peroxidases on sequence alignment data. Analysis of those alignments reveals a mean identity of the three yeast sequences with human GPx (GPx1) of ∼23%. However, the homology from each of the alignments deteriorated after amino acid residue 78, with a mean identity of only ∼7% with human GPx over the ∼85 C-terminal residues (14Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). When we re-examined the sequence alignments using ClustalW software, two gaps were introduced to the S. cerevisiae sequences commencing at residues 85 and 116 (Fig.1). This realignment increased the mean identity between residues 78 and the C termini with the corresponding portion of human GPx from ∼7 to ∼27%, giving an increase in the mean overall identity with human GPx from ∼23 to ∼33%. Moreover, this revision restored the alignment of the third member of the GPx catalytic triad, tryptophan (Trp-125) (22Epp O. Ladenstein R. Wendel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 23Maiorino M. Aumann K.D. Brigelius-Flohé R. Doria D. Van Den Heuvel J. McCarthy J. Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 76: 651-660Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar), with that of other GPxs (Fig. 1), while also increasing the homology in the regions corresponding to secondary structures such as α-helices and β-sheets (5Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohé L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 22Epp O. Ladenstein R. Wendel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The gaps introduced to the yeast sequences occur at the same positions as gaps that are conserved among PHGPx enzymes when aligned with GPxs (Fig. 1) and that are considered potentially to distinguish this subfamily from GPxs (24Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.-D. Blöcker H. Gross G. Kiess M. Klöppel K.D. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Schuckelt R. Ursini F. Wingender E. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7342-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, there was also greater sequence homology of the yeast proteins with PHGPx than with GPx of other organisms. The products of S. cerevisiae GPX1, GPX2, and GPX3 exhibited 36, 41, and 40% identity, respectively, with human PHGPx and a mean ∼47% overall identity with Arabidopsis thaliana PHGPx (Fig. 1). Thus, our sequence alignments indicated that the protein products ofGPX1, GPX2, and GPX3 in S. cerevisiae were more likely to be PHGPxs than GPxs. To test whether GPX1, GPX2, andGPX3 encoded active PHGPx-like enzymes, we measured enzymatic activities in extracts from yeast deletion strains defective for each gene as well as for all three genes (Fig.2). Only functionally active PHGPx-like enzymes should display activity against both the t-BHP and PCOOH substrates. In control reactions, we routinely confirmed that commercially purified GPx (from bovine erythrocytes, Sigma) exhibited strong activity with t-BHP but no detectable activity with PCOOH. In agreement with the previous work (14Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), we observed marked reductions in activity against the GPx substrate (t-BHP) in extracts from both the gpx3Δ and the triple-knockout strains compared with the wild type; GPX1 andGPX2 deletion had a lesser effect. We also detected PHGPx-like activity against the PCOOH substrate in the wild-type strain (Fig. 2). Moreover, this PHGPx-like activity was diminished markedly in the gpx2Δ (∼45% reduction), gpx3Δ (∼58% reduction), and triple-knockout (∼81% reduction) mutants, indicating that the proteins encoded by the deleted genes were likely to be PHGPxs. To characterize the products of GPX1, GPX2, andGPX3 further, we expressed recombinant forms of the three proteins heterologously using an E. coli overexpression system. E. coli lacks GPx-1 and PHGPx-like activities (25Hazebrouck S. Camoin L. Faltin Z. Strosberg A.D. Eshdat Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28715-28721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the negligible PHGPx activity that we detected in crude lysates from control cells transformed with empty vector was consistent with this. Cells overexpressing GPX1, GPX2, andGPX3 exhibited PHGPx-like activities that were ∼4-, 8-, and 11-fold higher than background, respectively (Fig.3 A). This sequence of increasing activity, with the GPX3 product apparently the most active, was consistent with our observations with the yeast mutants (Fig. 2). We also verified activity against t-BHP in the E. coli lysates (data not shown), confirming that the yeast protein products were active also against nonphospholipid hydroperoxides. We purified the recombinant GPX products so that we could rule out the possibility that they might be acting in conjunction with cellular phospholipases to give the effect of PHGPx-like activity in crude E. coli extracts (6van Kuijk F.J.G.M. Sevanian A. Handelman G.J. Dratz E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 7Chen J.-W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28421-28427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein products of GPX2 and GPX3 were expressed byE. coli in soluble form, facilitating purification by affinity chromatography. Based on PHGPx activity, the products ofGPX2 and GPX3 were purified 2.1- and 2.8-fold, respectively, relative to crude cell lysates (Fig. 3 A). Protein bands corresponding to the recombinant products were evident from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at ∼23 and ∼21 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3 B). The GPX1 product was produced by E. coli in an insoluble form. We succeeded in solubilizing this protein using tergitol (see “Experimental Procedures”), which allowed the detection of PHGPx-like activity in whole-cell extracts (above), but we were unable to produce purified protein. Because the product of GPX2 was not purified to full homogeneity, we used indomethacin and neomycin sulfate (26Futaki N. Takahashi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 27Weber J.T. Rzigalinski B.A. Ellis E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1800-1807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to inhibit any residual phospholipase activity. This also served as a control against bifunctional glutathione peroxidase/phospholipase A2 enzyme, such as has been described in mammalian cells (7Chen J.-W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28421-28427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). NADPH reducing activity in the PHGPx assays was not affected by the phospholipase inhibitors (Fig. 3 B). Thus, phospholipase activity does not contribute to the PHGPx-like activity exhibited by these proteins. Our sequence analyses and biochemical data collectively show that theS. cerevisiae ORFs YKL026c (GPX1), YBR244w (GPX2), and YIR037w (GPX3) have broader substrate specificities than originally thought and should be termed phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases. For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these proteins as PHGPx1p, PHGPx2p, and PHGPx3p, respectively. It was shown previously that the yeast GPX products confer protection against H2O2 (14Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), as is the case for many peroxidases. The ability to reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides, and impede the progress of lipid peroxidation after initiation, is the principal function that distinguishes PHGPx from GPx. To determine whether we could detect such function at the phenotypic level, we sought to enrich wild-type and gpxΔS. cerevisiae with the oxidation-sensitive polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) 18:3. S. cerevisiae does not synthesize PUFAs naturally, thus its membrane phospholipids normally contain only saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. However, 18:3 can comprise >60% of total membrane fatty acids in S. cerevisiaecultured in the presence of 1 mm 18:3, and this normally has no deleterious effect on growth (16Avery S.V. Howlett N.G. Radice S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3960-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Howlett N.G. Avery S.V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2971-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, because 18:3-enriched cells are sensitized to stress-induced lipid peroxidation, comparison of these cells with nonenriched cells provides an excellent means of testing whether lipid peroxidation is involved in a stress/toxicity mechanism (16Avery S.V. Howlett N.G. Radice S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3960-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Howlett N.G. Avery S.V. Appl. Environ.

In this work, while attempting to generate 18:3-enriched organisms, we found that the growth of the gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ mutant was almost fully abolished in the presence of 1 mm18:3 and was severely impaired at 0.1 mm 18:3 (Fig.4). The gpx single mutants did not exhibit diminished colony formation in the presence of 18:3, although colonies of the gpx3Δ strain were smaller at 1 mm 18:3. As reported previously (14Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), thegpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ mutant was sensitive to H2O2, but the degree of sensitization to 18:3 was greater; 1 mm 18:3 and 1 mm H2O2 had similar inhibitory effects on gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ cells, but only the latter treatment also affected the growth of wild-type cells (Fig. 4). To substantiate that protection against 18:3 was specific to PHGPx and is not a feature shared by nonphospholipid-targeting peroxidases, we tested S. cerevisiae mutants carrying deletions of theCCP1 (cytochrome c peroxidase), CTT1(cytosolic catalase), and TSA1 (thioredoxin peroxidase) genes. The growth of these mutants was not affected by the presence of 18:3 in the growth medium (data not shown). We also confirmed the 18:3 insensitivity of sod1Δ and sod2Δ cells as reported previously (29Do T.Q. Schultz J.R. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). While monitoring S. cerevisiae gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ in 18:3-supplemented liquid medium, we noted that differences in A600between wild-type and mutant cultures only became apparent after ∼4 h of incubation. Because absorbance measurements do not report directly on viability, to examine further this delayed inhibitory effect we monitored colony-forming ability at intervals during growth in 18:3-supplemented liquid medium (Fig.5 A). Reductions in colony-forming ability became apparent after 2 h at 2 mm 18:3 and only after 6 h at 1 mm 18:3, with a diminished rate of growth evident after 3 h in the latter case. This delay in 18:3 toxicity was in keeping with the slow incorporation of exogenous 18:3 into S. cerevisiae membrane lipids that takes place princi"

In contrast, global patterns of acetylation have not been ascribed to any particular regulatory function. In Drosophila, a specific modification of H4, acetylation at lysine 16, is enriched at hundreds of sites on the male X chromosome due to the activity of the male-specific lethal (MSL) dosage compensation complex. Utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have determined that H4Ac16 is present along the entire length of X-linked genes targeted by the MSL complex with relatively modest levels of acetylation at the promoter regions and high levels in the middle and/or 3′ end of the transcription units. We propose that global acetylation by the MSL complex increases the expression of X-linked genes by facilitating transcription elongation rather than by enhancing promoter accessibility. We have also determined that H4Ac16 is absent from a region of the X chromosome that includes a gene known to be dosage-compensated by a MSL-independent mechanism.

Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6584) Google Scholar), with the most widely studied modification being acetylation of histones H3 and H4.

In Drosophila, evidence for special roles for particular histone modifications was revealed with antisera to specific isoforms of H4. While H4 isoforms acetylated at lysine 5 or 8 are associated with numerous sites throughout the genome, H4 acetylated at lysine 12 is enriched in chromocentric heterochromatin, and H4 acetylated at lysine 16 (H4Ac16) is exclusively associated with the male X chromosome (7Turner B.M.

Male-specific acetylation of H4 at lysine 16 is mediated by males absent on the first (MOF),1 a MYST-family histone acetyltransferase present in the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex (9Akhtar A.

This histone acetyltransferase-containing complex is responsible for the dosage compensation of many X-linked genes by increasing their transcription in males to achieve a level of gene product equivalent to that generated by the two X chromosomes in females. In addition to its protein subunits, the MSL complex contains one of two nontranslated RNAs, roX1 and roX2 (11Smith E.R. Pannuti A. Gu W. Steurnagel A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Lucchesi J.C. Mol. Cell.

Current models suggest that functional complexes form at the sites of transcription of these RNAs, then access the X chromosome at a small number of additional entry sites and subsequently spread to the hundreds of other locations along the X chromosome where they are normally found (16Kelley R.L. Meller V.H. Gordadze P.R. Roman G. Davis R.L. Kuroda M.I. Cell. 1999; 98: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This spreading step requires both the histone acetyltransferase activity of MOF and the ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicase activity of another subunit, MLE (17Gu W. Szauter P. Lucchesi J.C. Dev Genet. 1998; 22: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Gu W. Wei X. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this paper, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation to map the distribution of H4Ac16 acetylation on known dosage-compensated genes inDrosophila embryos and find that this isoform is not restricted to the promoter region but is distributed throughout the length of these genes. Importantly, we show that runt, an X-linked gene known to be dosage-compensated independently of the MSL complex, escapes H4Ac16 acetylation and resides in a large chromosomal region that lacks this histone isoform, suggesting that broad or “global” patterns of acetylation are targeted to specific chromosomal or nuclear domains. Finally, we demonstrate an enhanced binding of the MSLs at the roX2 locus; this observation supports the hypothesis that the initial X chromosome targets of the MSL complex are likely to be entry sites, including theroX loci where the complex is expected to form. Mixed-stage embryos (0–12 h old) were cross-linked and sonicated according to Orlando et al. (19Orlando V. Jane E.P. Chinwalla V. Harte P.J. Paro R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5141-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The average size of DNA fragments was ∼500 base pairs. After sonication, debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was adjusted to 0.5% Sarkosyl and mixed for 10 min at 22 °C and respun. The supernatant was adjusted to RIPA (0.14 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-X100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), aliquoted, and frozen. Antiserum that is specific for histone H4 acetylated at lysine 16 was obtained from Serotec. In immunofluorescence experiments, this antisera paints the Drosophila male X chromosome as described previously (7Turner B.M. Birley A.J. Lavender J. Cell. 1992; 69: 375-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Core histone monoclonal MAB052 (Chemicon) was chosen to control for nucleosome concentration differences based on its high efficiency in ChIP; other general H4 antibodies tested showed little enrichment above the background obtained using naive rabbit serum. 3 µl of antisera was bound to 12.5 µl of protein A-agarose and incubated with 500 µl of extract (representing roughly 0.2-g embryos). Beads were washed several times in RIPA buffer, then washed in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. RNase was added at a concentration of 50 µg/ml for 10 min at 22 °C, adjusted to 0.5% SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase-K, and incubated 42 °C for 5 h. Formaldehyde cross-links were reversed by a further incubation at 65 °C overnight. DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Primer pairs were designed to amplify ∼300-base pair fragments (278) at regular intervals along genes of interest. Each PCR reaction contained 4 pmol of each primer, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm concentration of each dNTP, 1:10,000 dilution of Sybr Green1 (BioWhittaker), 5% Me2SO, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and 1.6 units of HotStar Taqpolymerase (Qiagen). PCR was performed and monitored in a Bio-Rad iCycler: 20 min activation of Taq at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C 30 s, 55 °C 30 s, 72 °C 45 s. Product formation was detected at 72 °C in the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel. Because Sybr Green1 binds to any double-stranded DNA, we checked for primer-dimer formation by performing control reactions without substrate, as well as using agarose gel electrophoresis to check for the desired product. Calculations of fold enrichment of an X sequence relative to an autosomal sequence utilize relative differences in the threshold cycle, the cycle of PCR at which the fluorescence reaches a given value or threshold that is in the log-linear range of amplification. The fold enrichment is calculated as: fold enrichment = (2∧ (core IPX − Ac16 IPX))/(2∧ (core IPA − Ac16 IPA)), where core IPX, core IPA, Ac16 IPX, and Ac16 IPA are the observed threshold cycles for the X or autosomal (A) sequences in the appropriate immunoprecipitation reaction. We performed ChIP experiments onPgd and Zw. These two X-linked genes, which encode the pentose-phosphate-shunt enzymes 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively, had been shown previously to be dosage-compensated by the MSL complex (20Belote J.M. Lucchesi J.C. Nature. 1980; 285: 573-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). An autosomal control for these studies was the Gpdh gene that encodes the glycerophosphate shuttle enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Since these three genes are expressed in all cell types, they are particularly good candidates for ChIP studies using mixed-stage embryos as starting material. Embryos were treated with formaldehyde, the cross-linked chromatin was solubilized by sonication, and the resulting extracts were used in immunoprecipitation reactions with H4Ac16 antiserum (Serotec) or with a monoclonal antiserum recognizing all histones (MAB052, Chemicon). DNA recovered from the precipitates was used in quantitative, real-time PCR with primer sets that amplify 300-base pair fragments at regular intervals across the genes of interest. The relative enrichment of H4Ac16 to the autosomal control was determined for each PCR-amplified fragment (see “Experimental Procedures”). The Pgd gene encodes a 3.2-kb primary transcript (21Scott M.J. Lucchesi J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 109: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and is flanked on its 5′ end by a predicted gene, EG87B1, and on its 3′ end by the bcn92 gene (Fig.1). Using the autosomal gene as reference, H4Ac16 is enriched along the entire length ofPgd, with greater amounts of this isoform present toward the 3′ end. Similar distributions were observed whether input DNA or DNA recovered from immunoprecipitations using core histone antiserum were used for normalization (data not shown). Because of the larger size of the Zw gene, we spaced the 300-base pair PCR-amplified fragments farther apart from one another. As was observed with Pgd, H4Ac16 is enriched along the length of Zw, with particularly high levels in the middle and 3′ end of the transcription unit (Fig.2). runt is an X-linked gene that is dosage-compensated by a process that is independent of MSL function (22Gergen J.P. Genetics. 1987; 117: 477-485PubMed Google Scholar). Using four sets of primers to amplify separate regions ofrunt, we established the absence of any significant enrichment of H4Ac16 at this locus (Fig.3). The locus of runt is in a relatively large gene-poor region of the X chromosome flanked on either side by heavy clusters of genes. We designed primer sets for several of these flanking genes and failed to find any enrichment for H4Ac16 (data not shown), suggesting that this may be a chromosomal domain to which the MSLs have not spread. The nearest site of enrichment for H4Ac16 that we detected is at the Tak1/Cg1812 region that is ∼100 kb distant from runt (Fig. 3). Our attempts to map the MSL complex along the X-linked genes described above yielded variable results that can be best ascribed to cross-linking efficiency or to antisera affinity problems. To increase the sensitivity of our assay, we attempted to map the complex to a region of the X chromosome where it may be enriched, i.e. to a chromosomal entry site. Among the 30–40 entry sites that have been identified by cytoimmunofluorescence, two are known to contain the roXgenes (14Meller V.H. Gordadze P.R. Park Y. Chu X. Stuckenholz C. Kelley R.L.

Cell. 1999; 98: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The MSL complex is found at either of the tworoX genes when these are moved to ectopic autosomal sites and spreads in cis from the transgenes to new sequences. The association of the complex with the roX transgenes occurs even when the latter are not transcribing, suggesting that theroX genes are not only sites of assembly for the complex but are also entry sites (14Meller V.H.

Stuckenholz C. Kelley R.L. Becker P.B. Kuroda M.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2236-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Using an MSL1 antiserum to precipitate the MSL complex (11Smith E.R. Pannuti A. Gu W. Steurnagel A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Lucchesi J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and primers to roX2, we determined a high enrichment of the complex at this locus (Fig. 4). Recently, a similar enrichment of MSLs was observed at rox1 (23Kageyama Y. Mengus G. Gilfillan G. Kennedy H.G. Stuckenholz C. Kelley R.L. Becker P.B. Kuroda M.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2236-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A segment of the 3′ end of the Pgd gene also shows a reproducible but modest enrichment for the MSL complex. Both Pgd sequences and roX2 sequences show similar levels of enrichment for H4Ac16. Several examples of the in vivo recruiting of histone acetyltransferase-containing complexes to specific genes by DNA-binding activator proteins have been reported in yeast (2Kuo M.H. vom Baur E. Struhl K. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1309-1320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 3Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D.

Nature. 1998; 394: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The resulting localized hyperacetylation of nucleosomes in the promoter domain of these genes can occur in the absence of transcription but is necessary for its inception (2Kuo M.H. vom Baur E. Struhl K. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1309-1320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition to this targeted effect, a background level of global histone acetylation is present throughout the yeast genome, leading to the hypothesis that it may function to enhance the competency of genes for the activation of transcription (2Kuo M.H. vom Baur E. Struhl K. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1309-1320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,4Reid J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Struhl K. Mol.

Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Histone acetyltransferases responsible for global acetylation may perform their function by docking on nucleosomes in a random manner (24Sendra R. Tse C. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24928-24934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or by associating with an elongating polymerase complex (25Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument- Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In contrast to the genome-wide acetylation found in yeast, the global acetylation of X-chromosome domains by the MSL complex inDrosophila has a clear role in transcription: a 2-fold enhancement in males. Although MOF can be targeted to a promoter in yeast resulting in a large induction of transcription (9Akhtar A. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), inDrosophila, the MSL complex is unlikely to play a role in gene activation and, therefore, is probably not targeted to promoters. This contention is supported by the fact that the complex is absent in females and by the observation that male embryos lacking the complex will develop up to the third larval instar without exhibiting any specific developmental defects; lethality in these individuals is the result of an imbalance in the relative level of X-linked and autosomal gene products. Concordant with these considerations is our finding of the relatively low level of MSL-dependent acetylation around the promoters of Pgd. In addition to the absence of targeting, the complex may be impaired from acetylating these nucleosomes by the presence of other chromatin remodeling modifications to the H4 tail or by the binding of other proteins that would prevent MOF from recognizing it as a substrate. A potentially related phenomenon has been described recently in yeast (26Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The histone acetyltransferase activity of MOF is not only directly correlated to the 2-fold enhancement of the rate of transcription of X-linked genes in males, but it is also required for the spreading of the MSL complex. This can be concluded from the observation that an intact complex with an inactive MOF subunit fails to spread beyond the entry sites (17Gu W. Szauter P. Lucchesi J.C. Dev Genet. 1998; 22: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Gu W. Wei X. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MOF overexpression results in the presence of H4Ac16 throughout the genome, and the complex is no longer limited to the X chromosome, but is found along all of the autosomes (18Gu W. Wei X. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This last observation suggests that broad patterns of acetylation could result if nucleosomes modified by MOF become new sequence-independent binding sites for the complex. A similar property is exhibited by the NuA4 complex of yeast. In anin vitro system that is not transcribing, the NuA4 complex can acetylate large domains of chromatin when targeted to a specific site, suggesting that the complex has the intrinsic ability to spread (27Vignali M. Steger D.J. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This multiprotein complex includes the only yeast homologs of known MSL subunits: Esa1p (MOF) and Eaf3p (MSL3) (28Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Cote J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and shares with the MSL complex the ability to acetylate histone H4 at lysine 16 (29Ohba R. Steger D.J. Brownell J.E. Mizzen C.A. Cook R.G. Cote J. Workman J.L. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for global acetylation on transcription was suggested by Tseet al. (30Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) who showed that processivity of RNA polymerase III through an array of nucleosomes was greatly increased by histone acetylation. This effect on transcription elongation correlated with an unfolded state of the highly acetylated nucleosomal arrays. In addition to the effect of histone acetylation on chromatin structure, transcription by T7 RNA polymerase through a single nucleosome was equally efficient whether utilizing tailless or hyperacetylated nucleosomal templates (31Protacio R.U. Li G. Lowary P.T. Widom J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8866-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this context, we suggest that the distribution of H4Ac16-containing nucleosomes along the length of a dosage-compensated gene results in a reduction in the time required for completing a transcript. If reinitiation is the rate-limiting step in production of transcripts, enhancement of elongation could increase gene expression if termination were coupled to reinitiation. Evidence that recycling of terminating polymerases enhances reinitiation rates has been found for polymerase I and polymerase III genes (32Dieci G. Sentenac A. Cell. 1996; 84: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar,33Jansa P. Burek C. Sander E.E. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our data provide a molecular confirmation in diploid cells of the discontinuous distribution of the MSL complex and of H4Ac16, as determined in larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes by cytoimmunofluorescence. Antisera to MSL1 (and MSL2, data not shown) are able to efficiently immunoprecipitate roX2 sequences (Fig.4) in contrast to the other gene loci tested. This can be explained by the special role of roX genes as entry sites: continuous recruitment for assembly and/or the presence of high affinity binding sequences at these loci would favor more efficient cross-linking. The physical proximity of a gene to an entry site may determine whether it attracts the MSL complex and whether histone H4 of its nucleosomes becomes acetylated at lysine 16. The nonrandom pattern of global acetylation along the X chromosome reflects specific regulatory differences in X-linked gene transcription. The compensation of the X-linked gene runtappears to be under the direct control of the Sxl gene and does not involve the MSL complex (22Gergen J.P. Genetics. 1987; 117: 477-485PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, sinceSxl makes a functional product only in females, equal levels of runt expression in the two sexes may be achieved by reducing (halving) the expression of the two doses of the gene in females (34Kelley R.L. Solovyeva I. Lyman L.M. Richman R. Solovyev V. Kuroda M.I. Cell. 1995; 81: 867-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These considerations are fully concordant with the absence of H4Ac16 on runt nucleosomes. By analyzing the regions adjacent to the locus of runt, we discovered that this gene resides in an extensive H4Ac16-free region. There is a growing list of examples of global domains of acetylation associated with specific regulatory sequences. An extensive region of acetylation at the human β-globin locus is linked to a sequence 5′ of the locus control region and may require relocalization to a particular nuclear domain (35Schubeler D. Francastel C. Cimbora D.M. Reik A. Martin D.I. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 940-950PubMed Google Scholar). The entire length of the human growth hormone gene cluster is characterized by an enrichment of H3 and H4 acetylation that appears to emanate from a DNase 1-hypersensitive site in the locus control region (36Elefant F. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13827-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In Drosophila dosage compensation, a model is emerging where the MSL complex is targeted to specific entry sites within a chromosomal domain and subsequently spreads via histone acetylation throughout this domain to enhance levels of transcription. The mode of targeting and spreading of the MSL complex within nuclear domains may be a paradigm of targeted global remodeling of chromatin responsible for the regulation of large groups of genes.

Thrombin activates the same signaling cascades in VSM cells, namely the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/Akt pathways. Nonetheless, thrombin was not mitogenic, but rather increased the expression of the smooth muscle-specific myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) indicative of anin vitro re-differentiation of VSM cells. A more detailed analysis of the temporal pattern and relative signal intensities revealed marked differences. The strong and biphasic phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to thrombin correlated with its ability to increase the activity of the SM-MHC promoter whereas Akt was only partially and transiently phosphorylated. By contrast, PDGF, a potent mitogen in VSM cells, induced a short-lived ERK1/2 phosphorylation but a complete and sustained phosphorylation of Akt. The phosphorylated form of Akt physically interacted with Raf. Moreover, Akt phosphorylated Raf at Ser259, resulting in a reduced Raf kinase activity and a termination of MEK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Disruption of the PI 3-kinase signaling prevented the PDGF-induced Akt and Raf-Ser259 phosphorylation. Under these conditions, PDGF elicited a more sustained MEK and ERK phosphorylation and increased SM-MHC promoter activity. Consistently, in cells that express dominant negative Akt, PDGF increased SM-MHC promoter activity. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active Akt blocked the thrombin-stimulated SM-MHC promoter activity. Thus, we present evidence that the balance and cross-regulation between the PI 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/Raf/MEK signaling cascades determine the temporal pattern of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and may thereby guide the phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells.

The contractility depends on the expression of proteins such as smooth muscle α-actin and smooth muscle myosin, and their expression levels vary depending on developmental and/or differentiation stage. During progression of vascular diseases or vascular injury following balloon dilatation, the release of growth factors such as PDGF,1 epidermal growth factor, or IGF has been shown to increase the smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration (1Jawien A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Lindner V. Schwartz S.M. Clowes A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 2Jackson C.L. Raines E.W. Ross R. Reidy M.A. Arterioscler.

Metabolism. 1995; 44: 58-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This de-differentiation is characterized by a decreased expression of contractile proteins. Following ligand binding, tyrosine kinase receptors undergo dimerization which allows transphosphorylation at multiple tyrosine residues. The intracellular signal transduction involves direct interaction of effector molecules via specific domains, e.g.Src homology 2 domains and phosphotyrosine-binding domains. More than 10 different Src homology 2 domain-containing molecules have been shown to bind to different autophosphorylation sites in the PDGF receptors, including signal transduction molecules with enzymatic activity like phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases), phospholipases Cγ, or Src as well as adaptor molecules such as Grb2 and Shc (4Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: 79-113PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Grb2/Sos or Shc in turn activates the small GTP-binding protein Ras which couples to the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. The cellular response of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling is influenced by the strength and the duration of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Depending on the cellular context, either proliferation or differentiation may result (5Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar). Other signaling cascades initiated by PDGF receptors and their potential cross-talk is currently under extensive investigation. Phosphorylated tyrosine residues (Tyr740 and Tyr751) on the PDGF β-receptor recruit the PI 3-kinases α and β to the plasma membrane via docking of the common p85 regulatory subunit (6Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar, 7Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the lipid kinase activity of PI 3-kinases catalyzes the formation of PI(3,4,5)-P3, a well defined plasma membrane anchor for the pleckstrin homology domains of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase I and protein kinase B/Akt (8Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane recruitment exposes Akt to subsequent activation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase I and related kinases that phosphorylate Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 (9Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Akt is a major participant in growth factor-mediated transcription and promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. These processes appear to involve phosphorylation and inactivation of several targets including Bad (10Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4919) Google Scholar), forkhead transcription factors (11Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J.

Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar). Recent reports by Rommel et al. (13Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nunez L. Rossman R. Reid K. Moelling K. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1738-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and Zimmerman and Moelling (14Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Akt negatively regulates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway via phosphorylation and inactivation of Raf at Ser259. Both PDGF and thrombin receptors qualitatively engage phospholipases C, ERKs, and PI 3-kinases. Nonetheless, in VSM cells, these agonists exert virtually opposite effects regarding the phenotypic modulation. Whereas thrombin via protease-activated receptors and Gβγ released from activated Gi proteins up-regulates the expression of contractile proteins, PDGF treatment exerted no differentiating effect. Vice versa, thrombin stimulation was without significant mitogenic potential, while PDGF almost reconstituted the proliferative effect of serum. To evaluate the contribution of the MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase pathways to the phenotypic modulation of VSM cells, we studied the coupling of PDGF and thrombin receptors to the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and the PI 3-kinase/Akt cascades and their cross-regulation. Our results demonstrate that PDGF and thrombin activate both pathways but exerted substantial differences in signal intensity and their kinetic patterns. Biochemical analysis revealed an interaction between Akt and Raf in PDGF-stimulated VSM cells that modulates the late-phase ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Abrogation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling changed the PDGF-induced proliferative response in VSM cells toward enhanced expression of contractile proteins. Culture media and trypsin were purchased from Life Technologies. Fetal calf serum and phosphate-buffered saline were obtained from Biochrom. Radiochemicals were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The anti-Raf monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Unless otherwise stated, all other antibodies were from New England Biolabs. LY294002, wortmannin, recombinant growth factors PDGF-BB, IGF-I, and epidermal growth factor were obtained from Calbiochem, and recombinant GST-MEK-His6was from Upstate Biotechnology. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Primary cultures of VSM cells from newborn rats were established as previously described (15Ives H.E. Schultz G.S. Galardy R.E. Jamieson J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 1400-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium, CM), 2% tryptose phosphate broth, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml). In all experiments, cells from passages 10–15 were used. Growth arrest was induced in a serum-free quiescent medium (QM) containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 4 mg/ml transferrin instead of serum. Prior to agonist application, cells were maintained in QM for 48–72 h. The transcriptional regulation of SM-1/SM-2 was assessed with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene expressed under the control of the myosin heavy chain promoter (nucleotides −1346 to +25, pCAT-1346) as described (16Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For transient transfection assays, cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well (60–80% confluency) and growth arrested in QM for 48 h prior to transfection. Transient transfections were performed in triplicates with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 10 μl/well Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) for 5 h. After 36–48 h, cell lysates were prepared using the CAT Enzyme Assay System (Promega). CAT activities were normalized to the protein concentration of each sample as measured by the BCA assay. Transfection of a promoterless CAT construct served as a baseline indicator, allowing all other promoter constructs to be expressed relative to promoterless activity. VSM cells were grown to confluency on Nunc Chamber Slides (Nalge Nunc International). After fixation in 1% formaline in phosphate-buffered saline, smooth muscle α-actin was detected by using a monoclonal primary antibody (1:150; Sigma) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:40, Dianova). Representative visual fields were photographed in an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Diaphot) applying a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (Chroma). VSM cells were directly lysed in Laemmli buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were separated on polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Akt, ERK1/2, MEK, or Raf were separated on 10% gels and probed with affinity purified polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-MEK, and phospho-Raf or with anti-Akt, -ERK1/2, MEK (New England Biolabs), and -Raf antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) to confirm equal loading of the gels. Primary antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:2000, New England Biolabs) using a chemiluminescence substrate (Lumiglo, New England Biolabs). RNA isolation, generation of DNA templates, and hybridization conditions were described previously (17Reusch H.P. Wagdy H. Reusch R. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The Maxiscript and RPA II kits from Ambion were used for RNase protection assays. In brief, 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized with radiolabeled probes overnight at 42 °C. Non-hybridized fragments were digested with RNase A/T1. The remaining protected fragments were separated by denaturing (8% urea) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm at −80 °C for 2–24 h. Bands were excised and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Equal loading was controlled by hybridization with a rat glutaraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe. VSM cells were serum starved for 48 h in serum-free medium. After stimulation, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (14Zimmermann S. Moelling K.

Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays were performed by incubating the immunocomplexes in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg of recombinant GST-MEK-His6 (Upstate Biotechnology) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and their phosphorylation was visualized and quantified with a phosphorimaging system (Fuji Bas-1500). VSM cells were lysed in a 0.25% Nonidet P-40 containing lysis buffer as described previously (14Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Cleared lysates (350 μg of protein in 800 μl) were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of monoclonal anti-Raf-1 antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) coupled to suspended Protein A-coupled Sepharose beads (Sigma). The pelleted beads were washed three times in 400 μl of lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS-Laemmli buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-Raf (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Akt and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies (New England Biolabs). We have recently demonstrated that serum, in addition to its mitogenic properties, increases the expression of contractile proteins in neonatal rat vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells (18Reusch H.P. Schaefer M. Plum C. Schultz G. Paul M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19540-19547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To evaluate the proliferative effects of serum, PDGF, and thrombin, VSM cells were cultured in serum-free QM supplemented with the respective agonist. The initial cell counts were assessed at the beginning of the experiment (day 0, Fig.1 A) and every following day. To account for potential degradation of the agonists, media were replaced every day. Whereas cell counts remained almost constant in QM, doubling rates in the presence of serum were about 1.5 days. Unlike thrombin (1 unit/ml), PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) was a powerful mitogen that reconstituted about 80% of the serum-mediated cell proliferation (Fig.1 A). The abundant expression of the contractile protein SM-α-actin in VSM cells cultured in serum-containing medium (Fig. 1 B), however, was not maintained when serum was replaced by PDGF (10 ng/ml; Fig. 1 C). The quantitative analysis of SM-α-actin steady-state expression applying RNase protection assays confirmed that SM-α-actin transcripts are highly abundant in VSM cells maintained in serum-containing CM compared with serum-starved (QM) controls. Re-exposure to serum increased the SM-α-actin steady-state expression within 24 h by 15-fold, whereas PDGF failed to significantly up-regulate the SM-α-actin expression within up to 3 days (Fig. 1,D and E). To define signaling pathways involved in PDGF-induced mitogenesis, we analyzed the activation of ERK1/2 and Akt, a downstream effector of the PDGF-induced PI 3-kinase signaling. Addition of PDGF (10 ng/ml) to serum-starved VSM cells led to a complete ERK1/2 phosphorylation which peaked within 5–10 min and returned to baseline levels at 30–60 min (a representative example of at least three independent experiments showing similar results is shown in Fig. 2). Equivalent results were obtained when lysates were probed for activated MEK applying phospho-specific anti-MEK antibodies (data not shown). Probing the same cell lysates with phospho-S473-Akt antibodies revealed a strong PDGF-induced Akt phosphorylation. Of note, antibodies raised against the amino acids 466–479 of Akt preferentially recognized the unphosphorylated state and consistently showed weaker signals when their epitope was phosphorylated at Ser473. The almost complete mobility shift of Akt in response to PDGF stimulation correlates with the reduction of anti-Akt signal intensities and gives a means for a semi-quantitative analysis of the phosphorylation state of Akt. In between 10 min and 1 h, the PDGF-induced Akt phosphorylation was almost complete (n = 12) and gradually declined within the following 2 h (Fig. 2). Thus, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 appeared to decline when Akt is activated. On the other hand, thrombin stimulation resulted in similar early phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but additionally induced a delayed second-phase ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Regarding Akt, thrombin exerted only a weak and transient phosphorylation as compared with the PDGF-stimulated samples that were processed on the same blot (Fig. 2). To estimate the phosphorylated, slower migrating fraction of ERK1/2 and to ensure equal loading of the lanes, blots were reprobed with antibodies detecting total ERK1/2. A comparable extent and kinetic pattern of Akt- and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was achieved when VSM cells were challenged with IGF-I (10 ng/ml). The addition of epidermal growth factor (10 and 100 ng/ml), however, led to a more transient phosphorylation of Akt (data not shown). Because cross-regulation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascades has been shown to influence proliferation or differentiation of myoblasts and HEK 293 cells by an Akt-dependent association and phosphorylation of Raf (13Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nunez L. Rossman R. Reid K. Moelling K. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1738-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 14Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether Raf and Akt physically interact in VSM cells. Serum-starved VSM cells were stimulated with PDGF for 15 and 60 min, and Raf was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates applying anti-Raf-1 antibodies. Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates with anti-Akt antibodies revealed an increased interaction between Akt and Raf after 15 and 60 min of PDGF-BB stimulation (Fig. 3). The relative weak signals may be due to a specific interaction of the Ser473-phosphorylated form of Akt that is poorly recognized by the antibody. The anti-Raf-1 immunoprecipitates was, therefore, repeated and probed with anti-phospho-Akt antibodies. Indeed, after PDGF treatment, Ser473-phosphorylated Akt could be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Raf-1 antibodies (Fig. 3). Thus, as a consequence of PDGF receptor signaling, the PI 3-kinase/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK cascades interact at the level of Akt and Raf. The functional consequence of this interaction was therefore investigated. The PDGF-induced Akt phosphorylation is most likely due to PI 3-kinases that are docked and activated by the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor. To analyze whether the interaction between phospho-Akt and Raf affects the phosphorylation-state of Raf, MEK, and ERK in living VSM cells, we studied the temporal phosphorylation pattern of these molecules in the absence and presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (20 μm). Aliquots of cell lysates were first probed with phospho-S473-Akt and Akt antibodies demonstrating a more than 80% reduction of the PDGF-induced Akt phosphorylation by LY294002 (Fig.4 A). Consistent with the findings shown in Fig. 2, thrombin induced a weak Akt phosphorylation at the 10-min time point that was sensitive to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor. At later time points, Akt phosphorylation was not detectable irrespective of the absence or presence of LY294002. A second set of aliquots from the same cell lysates were probed for phospho-S259-Raf and total Raf. After 10, 30, and, most strikingly, after 60 min of PDGF stimulation, the Ser259 phosphorylation of Raf was less intense in samples from VSM cells that were pretreated with LY294002 compared with controls without pretreatment. Since it is known that phospho-Ser259 serves a docking site for the inhibitory 14-3-3 protein, PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling may thereby reduce Raf kinase activity. By contrast, the thrombin induced moderate increase in Ser259 phosphorylation of Raf was further increased in the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (Fig. 4 B). At the level of MEK, the PDGF-induced phosphorylation was prolonged in the presence of LY294002, particularly after 60 min, suggesting an altered Raf kinase activity. The enhanced late-phase MEK phosphorylation was of importance since the resulting ERK1/2 phosphorylation was comparable to the peak signals induced by thrombin (Fig. 4, C andD). Similar results were obtained in a second experiment and in two additional experiments applying wortmannin (100 nm) instead of LY294002 (data not shown). The marked effect of PI 3-kinase inhibition on ERK1/2 and MEK phosphorylation in conjunction with an increased Ser259 phosphorylation of Raf points to a regulatory role of PI 3-kinase/Akt on the Raf kinase activity. We therefore determined the in vitro Raf kinase activity by co-incubating immunoprecipitated Raf protein and recombinant GST-MEK in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The formed [32P]GST-MEK was separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and visualized by autoradiography (Fig.5 A). The recovery of Raf was assessed by immunoblot analysis of the precipitates (Fig.5 A). In the absence of LY294002, the PDGF-induced Raf activity increased about 2-fold (n = three independent experiments) as compared with unstimulated cells at 10 min, 1.4-fold at 30 min, and returned to baseline at 60 min (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, in the presence of LY294002, Raf activity was about 1.5-fold at 3–10 min, but further increased to 1.7-fold at 30 min and 1.9-fold at 45–60 min (n = 6). Thus, the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway attenuates the Raf kinase activity and the resulting phosphorylations of MEK and ERK in PDGF-stimulated VSM cells. The role of PI 3-kinase signaling on the activity of the PDGF and thrombin mediated activity of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade was further analyzed by monitoring the extended time course of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the presence of different concentrations of LY294002. The pretreatment of VSM cells with 20 or 50 μmLY294002 led to a slightly delayed but long-lasting ERK phosphorylation as compared with solvent-pretreated cells (Fig.6 A). Similar alterations in ERK1/2 kinetics were obtained when VSM cells were pretreated with 100 nm wortmannin (data not shown). Thus, by inhibiting PI 3-kinases, the PDGF-induced, short-lived ERK1/2 phosphorylation kinetic was converted into a sustained ERK1/2 activity which is almost comparable to the kinetic of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) treatment (Fig. 6 B). At 50 μm concentrations, LY294002 diminished the thrombin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, an effect that is consistent with the observed PI 3-kinase-dependent increase in Ser259 phosphorylation of Raf (Fig. 4 B). Considering that a sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to thrombin was a prerequisite for the agonist-induced de novo synthesis of SM-MHC (18Reusch H.P. Schaefer M. Plum C. Schultz G. Paul M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19540-19547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), one may speculate that after disruption of the PI 3-kinase signaling, PDGF-induced phenotypic modulation of VSM cells may shift toward differentiation. This hypothesis was addressed by transient transfection of a CAT-reporter construct expressed under the control of the −1346 nucleotide promoter region of the SM-MHC gene (pCAT-1346). VSM cells maintained in QM showed an about 4-fold increased CAT activity as compared with controls transfected with a promoterless pCAT-basic vector. Under these conditions, the addition of PDGF for 36 h did not further increase the promoter activity (Fig.7 A). However, the pretreatment with LY294002 (50 μm) for 30 min prior to the addition of 10 ng/ml PDGF resulted in a more than 2-fold increase in CAT activity as compared with the absence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (n = 6). Similar results were obtained with wortmannin (100 nm). In the absence of PDGF, neither LY294002 nor wortmannin alone were sufficient to increase the promoter activity (data not shown). To further substantiate that the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibition on the PDGF-induced SM-MHC promoter activity is mediated via Akt, genetically encoded modulators were applied. VSM cells were co-transfected with pCAT-1346 and different amounts of expression plasmids encoding dominant negative Akt (K179A mutant). In all co-transfection experiments, the total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was kept constant (1 μg/well) by addition of promoterless pCAT-basic. The CAT activity in PDGF-stimulated VSM cells was concentration dependently increased by coexpression of dominant negative Akt (Fig. 7 B) corroborating the results with PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Thus, in PDGF-stimulated VSM cells, inhibition of PI 3-kinase/Akt extended ERK1/2 activity and up-regulated the SM-MHC promoter activity. Conversely, constitutively active Akt should disrupt the differentiating signal of thrombin stimulation. The coexpression of Akt N-terminal fused to the myristoylation/palmitylation motif from the Lck tyrosine kinase (19Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) concentration dependently disrupted the thrombin-induced promoter CAT activation by more than 90% (Fig.7 C) similar to the action of dominant-negative Raf (18Reusch H.P. Schaefer M. Plum C. Schultz G. Paul M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19540-19547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that sustained Raf/MEK/ERK signaling correlates with in vitro re-differentiation of VSM cells and is negatively controlled by the PI 3-kinase/Akt-pathway. Consistent with the hypothesis that the expression of contractile proteins may be controlled by a sustained ERK activation irrespective of the kind of the input signal, permanent activation of protein kinases C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1–100 nm) induced a sustained ERK1/2 activation and increased the SM-MHC promoter activity in a concentration-dependent fashion up to the 2.3-fold at 10 nm (data not shown). Similarly, heterologous expression of constitutively active Raf (C-terminal fragment) increased the SM-MHC promoter activity by about 2-fold (data not shown). Hence, expression of contractile proteins in VSM cells is increased either by ligands inducing a sustained ERK activation or by suppression of PI 3-kinase/Akt that blocks sustained signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade at the level of Raf. In neonatal rat VSM cells, serum treatment induces proliferation but also increases the expression of contractile proteins. Although the serum components PDGF and thrombin activate similar signal transduction pathways, they have a divergent impact on mitogenesis and differentiation. Our results in VSM cells demonstrate that the balance of the PI 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK activation corresponds to the proliferative and differentiating potential of the respective agonist. The PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt results in an interaction with Raf that is accompanied by a phosphorylation at Ser259, a decrease in Raf kinase activity, and subsequent reduced MEK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Thrombin induced a partial and temporary phosphorylation of Akt that was not"

The biosynthesis of glucosylceramides (GlcCer)1 is catalyzed by a UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase (glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), EC 2.4.1.80), which was originally found in animal tissues (10Basu S. Kaufman B. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5802-5804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the first cDNA coding for a human GCS has been cloned (11Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H.

These studies address different aspects of GlcCer functions: (i) GlcCer are membrane lipids and contribute to the physical properties and physiological functions of membranes; (ii) GlcCer serves as basic precursor for over 300 species of glycosphingolipids found in different mammalian cell types; and (iii) GlcCer synthesis and degradation are believed to contribute to the control of the level of ceramide, which is regarded as a second messenger involved in many biological processes such as heat stress response and apoptosis (15Huwiler A.

In addition, studies on the intracellular location and transport of GlcCer contribute to the understanding of the apical/basolateral asymmetry of epithelial cells (18VanMeer G. Holthuis J.C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 145-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast, very little is known about the functions and intracellular location of GlcCer in nonanimal organisms such as plants, fungi, and bacteria. Progress in this field is hampered by the lack of a genetic approach, since no genes or cDNAs coding for GCS have been cloned or identified from these organisms so far (except for our preliminary communication on a putative GCS from Candida albicans(19Leipelt M. Warnecke D.C. Hube B. Zähringer U. Heinz E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). The aim of the present work was the cloning of GCS from nonanimal organisms and establishment of novel model systems suitable for alterations in GlcCer content. These genetically modified organisms will enable investigations on various aspects of GlcCer synthesis, transport, and functions, which should extend and complement the studies limited so far to mammalian cells. Apart from this general approach, we address two aspects of sphingolipid metabolism, which are characteristic for fungi. First, there is growing evidence that these organisms maintain two separate pools of ceramides to be used for the synthesis of different sphingolipids. Ceramide backbones with C16 or C18 fatty acids linked to a 4,8-diene-9-methyl-sphingobase are exclusively precursors for GlcCer synthesis, whereas ceramide backbones with very long chain C24 and C26 fatty acids bound to phytosphinganine are restricted to the synthesis of the inositol-containing phosphosphingolipids (6Sakaki T. Zähringer U. Warnecke D.C. Fahl A. Knogge W. Heinz E. Yeast. 2001; 18: 679-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7Toledo M.S. Levery S.B. Straus A.H. Suzuki E. Momany M. Glushka J.

The mechanism of this separation of two sphingolipid pools is not understood. In the present study, we report the heterologous and homologous expression of various GCS in different yeasts and demonstrate that the enzymes can accept both ceramide pools as substrates. Furthermore, GlcCer of fungal origin have been found to act as elicitors of a plant defense response involving the transcription of specific genes. The structural features required to induce this effect have been identified in studies with different molecular species of GlcCer from the phytopathogen Magnaporthe grisea (21Koga J. Yamauchi T.

The identification of downstream members of this signaling cascade is a prerequisite for understanding the molecular mechanism of this plant-pathogen interaction. Therefore, we also carried out a detailed analysis of the GlcCer molecular species accumulating in P. pastoris as a consequence of the heterologous expression of GCS. Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (MRF′) and the vector pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used for cloning of the putative GCS genes and cDNAs. Expression of these sequences inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, P. pastoris, andC. albicans was performed with pVT-U (23Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y.

Hirabayashi (Institute of Chemical and Physical Research, Saitama, Japan). A PCR fragment corresponding to the coding sequence (CDS) of this clone was cloned into expression vectors forS. cerevisiae and P. pastoris (pVT-U → pVHs, pGAPZ → pGHs, pPIC3.5 → pPHs). PCR with a λ-ZAP cDNA library of C. elegans (a gift from R.D. Walter, Bernhard-Nocht-Institut für Tropenmedizin, Hamburg) was performed with degenerate primers: 5′-GAYCCNAAYYTNMWNMAYAAYYTNGARACNTTYTT-3′ and 5′-TANCCNGGVWKNADRTTRTTDATYTTNGGRTT-3′. The resulting PCR fragment was used to synthesize a digoxigenin-labeled probe for the screening of the same cDNA library. In vivo excision of a positive clone resulted in the plasmid pBCe2 that had an insert of 1746 bp. It contains a CDS of 1332 bp encoding a polypeptide of 443 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 50.1 kDa. These sequence data have been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under GenBankTM accession number AF364401. The cloned cDNA corresponded to parts of a genomic sequence with the GenBankTM accession number U58735. However, it should be pointed out that the polypeptide deduced from the CDS of the isolated cDNA clone is not identical to the hypothetical protein AAC48147 (GenPep; synonymous Q19624, TrEMBL), which was deduced from the genomic fragment. A PCR fragment corresponding to the CDS was cloned into expression vectors for S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris (pYES2 → pYCe2, pGAPZ → pGCe2). Sequence data for C. albicans were obtained from the Stanford DNA Sequencing and Technology Center Web site (www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/candida). Sequencing of C. albicans was accomplished with the support of the NIDR and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. The CDS HSX11, on contig 6–2503, of 1635 bp encodes a polypeptide of 544 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 62.5 kDa. A PCR fragment corresponding to the CDSHSX11 was generated with genomic DNA of C. albicans as template. This PCR fragment was cloned into expression vectors for S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris, andC. albicans (pYES2 → pYCa, pVT-U → pVCa, pPIC3.5 → pPCa, pGAPZ → pGCa, pBI-1 → pBICa). We cloned a GCS from P. pastoris by a PCR-based strategy with degenerate oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GGIGSIRRRYTNGANGARATGTT-3′ and 5′-YTTICKIACNCKNARCCA-3′. The resulting PCR fragment was used to synthesize a digoxigenin-labeled probe for the screening of a genomic DNA library of P. pastoris strain GS115 (28Cregg J.M. Barringer K.L. Hessler A.Y. Madden K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The insert of a positive clone was sequenced, and these data have been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under GenBankTM accession number AF364403. It contains a CDS of 1530 bp encoding a polypeptide of 509 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 57.2 kDa. A PCR fragment corresponding to the CDS was cloned into expression vectors for S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris (pYES2 → pYPp, pVT-U → pVPp, pPIC3.5 → pPPp). We obtained a cDNA clone, mgae5aF11f, corresponding to the expressed sequence tag with the GenBankTM accession number AI069020, from the Clemson University Genomics Institute. Both strands of the cDNA were sequenced, and these data have been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under GenBankTM accessionAF364402. It contains a CDS of 1485 bp encoding a polypeptide of 494 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 55.1 kDa. A PCR fragment corresponding to the CDS was cloned into expression vectors for S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris (pVT-U → pVMg, pGAPZ → pGMg, pPIC3.5 → pPMg). We obtained a cDNA clone GA_Ea25B13 from cotton, corresponding to the expressed sequence tag with the GenBankTM accession number AW729468, from the Clemson University Genomics Institute. Both strands of the cDNA were sequenced, and these data have been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under GenBankTM accession number AF367245. It contains a CDS of 1563 bp encoding a polypeptide of 520 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 58.6 kDa. A PCR fragment corresponding to the CDS was cloned into expression vectors for S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris (pYES2 → pYGa, pGAPZ → pGGa, pPIC3.5 → pPGa). A PCR fragment corresponding to the CDS BAA18121 (1170 bp, 389 amino acids, 43.6 kDa, equivalent to slr0813, GenBankTM accession numberD90911) was generated with genomic DNA as template. This PCR fragment was cloned into expression vectors for S. cerevisiae andP. pastoris (pYES2 → pYS, pGAPZ → pGS). To generate a ugt51b1 null mutant, we made use of a double selection strategy. The use of a HIS4 cassette alone for transformation caused high background. Similarly, plating of more than 50,000 cells on Geneticin plates after transformation with aKANR cassette resulted in high background as well. Therefore, the entire CDS of the sterol glucosyltransferase geneUGT51B1 (25Warnecke D. Erdmann R. Fahl A. Hube B. Müller F. Zank T. Zähringer U. Heinz E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13048-13059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was replaced by the HIS4 gene fromP. pastoris and the KANR gene. Transformants were subsequently screened for histidine prototrophy and Geneticin (G418) resistance. The construct for disruption comprised theHIS4 gene and the KANR gene flanked by 0.5-kb homology regions to the UGT51B1 3′- and 5′-noncoding regions. These regions were amplified by PCR with a genomic fragment of P. pastoris DNA (AF091397). The primers were as follows: FM16 (5′-AAA GCG GCC GCC CGG GGT CCC CAT CAC AAG CAA-3′) and FM17 (5′-AAA GCG GCC GCC CTT CAG AAC CCC CCT TAG AG-3′) for the 5′-region (PCR1), and FM18 (5′-AAA GAA TTC ATT TTG TGT AGC TTT TCT TTT TTT TTT TTC-3′) and FM19 (5′-AAA GAA TTC CCG GGT TGA ACT TGG AGT AAG TGG AG-3′) for the 3′-region (PCR2). The two PCR fragments were cloned into the vector pGEM-T (Promega), resulting in pPCR1Pp and pPCR2Pp. The HIS4 gene was excised byNotI/EcoRI from the plasmid pHIL-D2 (Invitrogen) and cloned into the vector pBluescriptNotI/EcoRI, resulting in pMF1. The 3′-region ofUGT51B1 was excised by EcoRI from pPCR2Pp and cloned into pMF1 EcoRI resulting in pMF2. The 5′-region ofUGT51B1 was excised by NotI from pPCR1Pp and cloned into pMF2 NotI resulting in pMF3. The kanamycin cassette was excised from the plasmid pKRP11 (29Reece K.S. Phillips G.J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) by SphI and cloned into pMF3 SphI, resulting in pMF3KR. This plasmid was digested by SmaI and introduced into P. pastoris GS115. Transformants were screened for histidine prototrophy on minimal media lacking histidine. Colonies were rinsed off with water, and 50,000 cells were plated on YPD plates (13.3 cm2) containing Geneticin (250 μg/ml). The replacement of UGT51B1 was confirmed by PCR (data not shown). Gene disruption in the diploid yeast C. albicans requires the successive elimination of both alleles. Disruption of the GCS gene (HSX11) in the strain CAI4 was performed using the ura-blaster protocol (27Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gow N.A. Robbins P.W. Lester J.W. Brown A.J. Fonzi W.A. Chapman T. Kinsman O.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6216-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The plasmid generated for gene disruption comprised a hisG::URA3::hisG cassette flanked by 0.6-kb homology regions to the GCS 3′- and 5′-non-coding regions. These regions were amplified by PCR with genomic DNA of C. albicans as template. The primers were as follows: 5′-GAGCTCATGGTTCAAGAAGAATTA-3′ and 5′-AGATCTTTGTCCCATTTTTCTCGA-3′ for the 5′-region (PCR1) and 5′-CTGCAGAAGACCCTAAAGTGAAA-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTTCACATTTCTTCAGCAGT-3′ for the 3′-region (PCR2). The two PCR fragments were cloned into the vector pBluescript EcoRV, resulting in pPCR1Ca and pPCR2Ca. The 3′ region of HSX11 was excised from pPCR2Ca by SacI/SalI and cloned into the vector pUC18 SacI/SalI, resulting in pUPCR2Ca. The hisG::URA3::hisG cassette was excised byBglII/PstI from the vector pMB-7 (27Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into the vector pUPCR2Ca BglII/PstI, resulting in pML1. The 5′-region of HSX11 was excised byPstI/HindIII from pPCR1Ca and cloned into pML1PstI/HindIII, resulting in pML2. This gene disruption construct was linearized with PvuII and used for transformation of C. albicans. Successive disruptions of the wild-type HSX11 alleles resulted finally in the strain ML4 (Δura3::imm434/Δura3::imm434/Δhsx11::hisG/Δhsx11::hisG). Gene disruptions were monitored by Southern analysis after digestion of genomic DNA with XbaI and HindIII (data not shown). To construct a GCS null mutant, a fragment of the CDS was replaced by the Sh ble cassette, which confers resistance to ZeocinTM (Invitrogen). The construct for disruption comprised the Sh ble gene flanked by 0.7-kb homology regions to the CGS 3′- and 5′-noncoding regions. These regions were amplified by PCR with a genomic fragment of P. pastoris DNA. The primers were as follows: 5′-TCTAGAATGATAATGCAGCTTGGA-3′ and 5′-GAATTCAGGTACATGATGTACAAG-3′ for the 5′-region and 5′-CTCGAGACTACAGAGTGCCTGTTA-3′ and 5′-GGTACCTACAGCTTCTCAGTCTCC-3′ for the 3′-region. The two PCR fragments were cloned into the vector pBluescript/EcoRV resulting in pPCR1Pp and pPCR2Pp. The Sh ble cassette was amplified by PCR with the vector pGAPZC as a template and the primers 5′-GAATTCGATCCCCCACACACCATA-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGAACGCCAGCAACGCGGCC-5′. The PCR fragment was cloned into the vector pBluescript/EcoRV, resulting in pBShble. The 3′ region of the GCS was excised byXbaI/EcoRI from pPCR2Pp and was cloned into pBluescript XbaI/EcoRI, resulting in pBPCR2Pp. The Sh ble cassette was excised byEcoRI/XhoI from pBShble and cloned into the vector pBPCR2Pp EcoRI/XhoI, resulting in pML3. The 5′ region of the GCS was excised by XhoI/KpnI from pPCR1Pp and cloned into pML3 XhoI/KpnI, resulting in pML4. A linear fragment containing the gene disruption construct was obtained by digestion of pML4 byXbaI/KpnI. Transformations of P. pastoris were performed by electroporation. ZeocinTM-resistant transformants were selected by growth on YPD plates containing 100 mg/liter ZeocinTM. Replacement of the wild-type GCS gene was monitored by PCR and Southern analysis (data not shown). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, the sedimented cells were boiled for 10 min in water, and lipid extraction was performed as described by Warnecke et al. (25Warnecke D. Erdmann R. Fahl A. Hube B. Müller F. Zank T. Zähringer U. Heinz E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13048-13059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Straight phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of GlcCer species was performed on a Lichrosorb 60 Si 7 column (125 × 3 mm) with a linear gradient from solvent A to 25% solvent B in A (where A is chloroform and B is methanol/water (95:5, v/v)) in 15 min at 40 °C. Molecular species of GlcCer were separated by isocratic reversed phase HPLC on a Multospher 100 RP18–5 column (250 × 4.6 mm) in chloroform/methanol (60:40, v/v) at 24 °C. Elution was monitored by a Sedex light scattering detector operated at 50 °C. The glycolipids were acetylated for NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Fatty acid and sugar analysis by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was performed as described previously (31Jorasch P. Warnecke D.C. Lindner B. Zähringer U. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3770-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Peracetylated derivatives of GlcCer and glycosyldiacylglycerols were analyzed by mass spectrometry on an HP 5989A instrument (Hewlett-Packard) using the direct insertion probe mode and heating the sample by a temperature gradient starting from 80 °C (3 min) → 325 °C at 30°/min. Electron impact mass spectra were measured at 70 eV, and chemical ionization mass spectra were recorded with ammonia as reactant gas (0.1 megapascals). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a 600-MHz spectrometer (Avance DRX 600, Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with an inverse probe head using capillary microtubes with 3-mm outer diameter (Kontes Glass Company). The peracetylated and purified monoglycosyl diacylglycerol (∼100 μg) was dissolved in 200 μl of CDCl3 (99.96%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA), and spectra were recorded at 300 K with reference to internal tetramethylsilane (δH = 0.0 ppm) using standard Bruker software (XWINNMR, version 2.6). In order to discover putative GCS genes or cDNAs from animals, fungi, plants, and bacteria, sequence candidates were identified using a sequence alignment approach based on the amino acid sequence of the GCS fromHomo sapiens (11Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A BLAST data base search (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71457) Google Scholar) revealed a number of sequence similarities to deduced amino acid sequences of cDNAs, genomic DNA fragments, and expressed sequence tags from animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria (TableI). We obtained cDNA clones corresponding to two of the expressed sequence tags from G. arboreum and M. grisea from Clemson University Genomics Institute. These clones were sequenced, and their deduced amino acid sequences showed similarities to the human GCS.Table IMembers of a family of glucosylceramide synthases and sequences of unknown functionSourceGenBank™/GenPeptSwissProt/TrEMBLGCSType1-aG, genomic DNA; EST, expressed sequence tag.ReferenceAnimals H. sapiensD50840/BAA09451.1Q16739YescDNA11 Mus musculusD89866/BAA28782.1O88693YescDNA37 Rattus norvegicusAF047707/CAA11853.1O55149YescDNA38 Cricetulus griseus (Chinese hamster)AF351131?cDNA D. melanogaster (fruit fly)AE003456/AAF46795.1?G C. elegans(C.e.1)U53332/AAK31533/AAC71156Q21054YesG37 C. elegans(C.e.2)U58735/AF364401/AAC48147Q19624YesG + cDNAThis study C. elegans(C.e.3)Z81116/CAB03296O18037?G Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog)BE190123?EST Danio rerio (zebrafish)AI545863?EST Bombyx mori (silkworm)AV403938?ESTYeasts and fungi C. albicans—1-b—, not available from GenBank™, gene HSX11, on contig 6–2503; information available on the World Wide Web at www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/candida.YesGThis study P. pastorisAF364403YesGThis study M. griseaAF364402YescDNAThis study Neurospora crassaAL353820/CAB88601?G Pneumocystis cariniiAP338415?cDNA Pichia angustaAL435585?GPlants Ceratopteris richardii(fern)BE643203?EST Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)AC005169/AAC62128.1?G G. arboreum(cotton)AF367245YescDNAThis studyBacteria Synechocystis sp.

Open table in a new tab In a second approach, degenerate primers deduced from conserved regions of GCS were used to clone novel putative GCS sequences by a PCR-based strategy with subsequent screening of cDNA or genomic libraries with specific probes. Thereby, we cloned another two putative GCS sequences from C. elegans and P. pastoris. The cloning procedures, the features of the DNA fragments, and the availability of these data in public data bases are described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Table I. When deduced protein sequences were aligned, all sequences listed in Table I fell into a previously identified glycosyltransferase family: family 21 of NDP-sugar hexosyltransferases (33Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 34Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B.

The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1999: 3-12Google Scholar) (Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes Server, available on the World Wide Web at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼pedro/CAZY/db.html). The same family has also been described as group 9 of the NRD2 glycosyltransferases, which were grouped with respect to different types of “nucleotide recognition domains” (NRDs) (35Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 961-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This family shares few but significant similarities to the glycosyltransferase family 2. These similarities have been described as the D1,D2,D3,Q/RXXRW motif (36Marks D.L. Dominguez M. Wu K. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26492-26498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Within the family 21, three mammalian sequences from humans (11Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), mice (37Ichikawa S. Hirabayashi Y.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 198-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have previously been identified experimentally as GCS. However, based on their similarity to the mammalian enzymes, some of the other sequences have been automatically annotated as GCS in the data bases without supporting experimental evidence. Fig. 1 shows a sequence alignment of selected members of this enzyme family. Remarkably, there are only a few conserved amino acids, and the overall similarity between the enzymes from species with remote evolutionary relationship is rather low. The identities to the human GCS are as follows: one protein fromDrosophila melanogaster had 46% identity, three different proteins from C. elegans had 30% identities, three proteins from fungi (P. pastoris, C. albicans, andM. grisea) had 16–21% id"

https://openalex.org/W1977464433,"Using bioinformatic tools, mutagenesis, and binding studies, we have investigated the structural organization of the extracellular region of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, a functional receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Multiple sequence alignments of seven vertebrate sequences and one invertebrate RET sequence delineated four distinct N-terminal domains, each of about 110 residues, containing many of the consensus motifs of the cadherin fold. Based on these alignments and the crystal structures of epithelial and neural cadherins, we have generated molecular models of each of the four cadherin-like domains in the extracellular region of human RET. The modeled structures represent realistic models from both energetic and geometrical points of view and are consistent with previous observations gathered from biochemical analyses of the effects of Hirschsprung's disease mutations affecting the folding and stability of the RET molecule, as well as our own site-directed mutagenesis studies of RET cadherin-like domain 1. We have also investigated the role of Ca2+ in ligand binding by RET and found that Ca2+ ions are required for RET binding to GDNF but not for GDNF binding to the GFRα1 co-receptor. In agreement with these results, RET, but not GFRα1, was found to bind Ca2+ directly. Our results indicate that the overall architecture of the extracellular region of RET is more closely related to cadherins than previously thought. The models of the cadherin-like domains of human RET represent valuable tools with which to guide future site-directed mutagenesis studies aimed at identifying residues involved in ligand binding and receptor activation.

It cannot by itself bind its ligand, GDNF,1 unless in a complex with another protein, the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored receptor GFRα1 (1Airaksinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 2Saarma M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6968-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast with other receptor tyrosine kinases, there appears to be only one RET homologue in all species investigated so far. All members of the GDNF ligand family utilize RET as a signal transducing receptor subunit, with specificity being determined by cooperation between RET and different members of the GFRα family of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored receptors (1Airaksinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 2Saarma M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6968-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Both gain- and loss-of-function mutations in the RETgene have been identified in human diseases. Mutations inRET of patients with multiple endocrine neuroplasias type 2A and 2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma induce constitutive activation of the RET tyrosine kinase and lead to congenital and sporadic cancers in neuroendocrine organs (3Edery P. Eng C. Munnich A. Lyonnet S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Santoro W. Carlomagno F. Melillo R.M. Billaud W. Vecchio G. Fusco A. J. Endocrinol. Inv. 1999; 22: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the other hand, loss-of-function mutations in RET cause a dominant genetic disorder of neural crest development known as Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), which results in the death of neurons in distal segments of the enteric nervous systems and colon aganglionosis (5Carlomagno F. Devita G. Berlingieri M.T. Defranciscis V. Melillo R.M. Colantuoni V. Kraus M.H. Difiore P.P. Fusco A. Santoro M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2717-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The extracellular region of the RET molecule is peculiar compared with that found in other receptor tyrosine kinases in that it lacks leucine repeats, immunoglobulin, and fibronectin-like domains that are common in many other such receptors. The only recognizable motif within its over 600-residue-long extracellular region so far appears to be a stretch of 110 residues with similarity to members of the cadherin family of Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion molecules (6Iwamoto T. Taniguchi M. Asai N. Ohkusu K. Nakashima I. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1087-1091PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schneider R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 468-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cadherins comprise a large and divergent superfamily with at least six subfamilies and several more divergent members, characterized on the basis of their domain architecture, genomic structure, and phylogenetic relationships (8Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The extracellular region of cadherins is formed by a variable number of repeated modules (cadherin domains) of about 110 residues, all sharing a common consensus sequence and often with a Ca2+-binding site present in between each of the domains. Several crystal structures of cadherin domains from epithelial and neural cadherins have been solved (9Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 10Overduin M. Harvey T.S. Bagby S. Tong K.I. Yau P. Takeichi M. Ikura M.

Ca2+ binding appears to help to linearize and rigidify the structure and, at least according to one report, to promote dimerization of cadherin domains (12Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Results from several laboratories have indicated that lateral dimerization or clustering of cadherins may increase their adhesivity (see, for example, Ref. 9Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As originally proposed, the segment of similarity between RET and cadherins would extend from the middle of one cadherin domain to the next over a Ca2+-binding motif (6Iwamoto T. Taniguchi M. Asai N. Ohkusu K. Nakashima I. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1087-1091PubMed Google Scholar). However, because the remaining portion of the RET extracellular region did not appear to display any obvious similarity to cadherins or to any other protein, the actual relationship between RET and cadherins has been unclear. In the present study, we have used a battery of bioinformatic tools together with mutagenesis and binding studies to explore the structural organization of the extracellular region of RET. These studies allow us to propose a model for the overall architecture of the extracellular region of the RET molecule, as well as homology-based model structures of four of the five identified domains in this region. Protein sequence data were retrieved from GenBankTM. Multiple sequence alignments were obtained by CLUSTALW running at the Decypher hardware accelerator (www.timelogic.com). For graphical presentation of multiple sequence alignments, the program TREEVIEW (13Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Sequence similarity searches were performed using PSI-BLAST running on the servers at either NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) or at the Decypher hardware accelerator (www.timelogic.com/algo-blast2/PSIBLAST_aahtml-ssi). In both cases, the default settings of the program suggested by the input mask of the server were used with the low complexity filter being activated. Sequence-structure annotation was performed using the repertoire of vertebrate RET cadherin-like domains to search the Hidden Markov Model Library of protein domains implemented in the Structural Classification of Proteins data base release 1.53 available at stash.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY/hmm.html. Additionally, the fold of cadherin-like domains in the extracellular domain of RET was predicted using the three-dimensional position-specific scoring matrix method of enhanced genome annotation using structural profiles (14Kelley L. MacCallum R. Sternberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) available at www.bmm.icnet.uk/∼3dpssm/. The program was used with the Global/Local and the low complexity filter option activated and with the sequences of vertebrate RET cadherin-like domains as baits. The Swiss-PdbViewer suite of programs (15Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9507) Google Scholar) was used for comparative modeling of cadherin-like domains of human RET. Sequences of cadherin domains with three-dimensional structures available in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (16Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer E.J. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8163) Google Scholar) were aligned with human RET cadherin-like domain sequences, superimposing the cadherin consensus sequence as identified in Fig. 2 A. The hydrophobic residues represented in the cadherin consensus sequence were found to define the core of the classic cadherin domains with their side chains buried in the nonpolar interior of proteins (9Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 11Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 12Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). RET sequences were aligned to classic cadherin domains to optimize a match for consensus residues with an identical or conservative replacement. Gaps and insertions in the alignments were positioned within the variable loop regions in the cadherin template structures. As a constraint in model building, the superimposed cadherin consensus residues were fixed in position. The models were submitted to ProModII for model building using the Swiss-PdbViewer interface without adding any further constraint to the structure. The returned models were examined for unfavorable van der Waals' overlaps, which were removed by minimal rotation around side chain torsion angles. A short energy minimization was performed using the GROMOS 96 implementation in the Swiss-PdbViewer program suite (15Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9507) Google Scholar). The quality of the first models was evaluated manually and with a variety of computational techniques implemented in the World Wide Web-based Biotech structure and model verification server (biotech. ebi.ac.uk:8400/). Most quality indicators were in the normal range reported for computed modeled structures. As expected, some surface-located regions, especially those near gaps or insertions, were poorly modeled. The loops in the problematic regions were modeled individually, and the quality indicators for the model structures were then recalculated. When no suitable loop was available from a template cadherin structure, the loop data base implemented in the Swiss PdbViewer program suite was searched to rank candidate loops from other proteins. The loop segment was then modeled on the best template that had no short contacts with the rest of the model. The final models were energy minimized using the GROMOS 96 implementation in the Swiss-PdbViewer program suite (15Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9507) Google Scholar). GROMOS computations were done in vacuo with the GROMOS 43B1 parameter set without reaction field. During the initial cycles of energy minimization, the α-carbon backbone was kept rigid, and the side chains alone were moved. Subsequently all atoms in the structures were allowed to move during energy minimization. This approach kept disturbances of the backbone structure to a minimum. Energy minimization was performed until all short contacts and inconsistencies in geometry were rectified. During the initial cycles of energy minimization, the electrostatic term was not included because the main object was to relieve steric clashes and to rectify bad geometry. The electrostatic term was then included in advanced stages of energy minimization. The extracellular domain of human RET, tagged with a hemagglutinin epitope, was subcloned in the pSectag2A vector (Invitrogen) for secretion of expressed proteins in mammalian cells. Point mutations were introduced using the QuickChange method (Stratagene) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Cell lines stably expressing RET extracellular domain constructs were made by transfection of either human embryonic kidney (HEK293) or Chinese hamster ovary cells using the calcium phosphate transfection method. Hygromycin was applied as the selection marker. Individual clones were analyzed for protein expression by Western blotting. For protein expression, the cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 60 μg/ml gentamycin until 80% confluency. The cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and switched to serum-free medium for 96–120 h. Subsequently, the medium was harvested, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the medium was concentrated by Amicon-10 ultrafiltration. For protein production in Chinese hamster ovary cells, sodium butyrate (2 mm) was included in the serum-free medium to enhance protein expression. This treatment resulted in substantial cell death after 3 days. Treatment with Endo H deglycosylase or Peptide:N-glycosidase F was performed according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Deglycosylated proteins were subsequently separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected with an anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody and anti-mouse secondary antibodies using chemiluminescence or chemifluorescence reagents from Pierce or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Microtiter plate wells (Nunc) were coated with 500 ng of an antibody recognizing the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (Pierce). The wells were subsequently blocked with a Tris-buffered saline (TBS) solution containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. One hundred nanograms of mouse RET-Fc fusion protein (R&D Systems) in blocking solution was subsequently added to the wells. The same amount of GFRα1-Fc (R & D Systems) was added to control wells. Capture of the Fc fusion protein was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature. Negative control wells, coated with only capturing antibody, were also included in the experiments. After rinsing the wells with TBS, 25 μm45Ca2+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBS/bovine serum albumin buffer was added to the wells and left for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the wells were washed three times with TBS, bound 45Ca2+ was released with 100 mm HCl, and the amount of radioactivity was counted. All data points were assayed in triplicate. Binding studies were carried out with recombinant rat GDNF produced in Sf21 insect cells and purified as described previously (17Trupp M. Rydén M. Jörnvall H. Timmusk T. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Ibáñez C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). GDNF was iodinated by the lactoperoxidase method to a specific activity of 0.5–2 × 108 cpm/μg. 125I-GDNF at 10 ng/ml was allowed to bind to cell monolayers at 4 °C during 3 h in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl) in the presence or the absence of Ca2+ ions (5 mmCl2Ca) or the Ca2+ chelator EGTA (at 5 mm) as indicated. After binding, cross-linking was initiated by addition of ethyl-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide supplemented with Sulfo-NHS (Pierce) or bis(succinimidyl) suberate as cross-linking agents for 30 min at 4 °C. Unlabeled GDNF was used at 50× molar excess to verify specific binding. Receptor complexes were fractionated by gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography in a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). A GenBankTM search for RET sequences retrieved seven RET molecules from vertebrate species and one invertebrate RET from Drosophila melanogaster. The cytoplasmic kinase domain of RET is the best conserved region of the molecule, showing 90% sequence identity among the seven vertebrate species and 65% after including Drosophila RET. In the extracellular domain, a cysteine-rich region of ∼120 residues containing a highly conserved pattern of 14 cysteine residues is found adjacent to the transmembrane segment. Although the cysteine pattern is highly conserved among all RET molecules in this segment, the residues between the cysteines are less well conserved, and the whole region shows 40% sequence identity among vertebrate RET molecules and 30% after including Drosophila RET. The conservation of RET extracellular sequences in the ∼500 residues upstream of the cysteine-rich region is much lower, with only 20% identity among vertebrate RET sequences and 5% after including DrosophilaRET. Included within this region, is a segment of about 110 residues previously identified as having sequence similarity to cadherins, containing a putative cadherin-like calcium-binding motif (6Iwamoto T. Taniguchi M. Asai N. Ohkusu K. Nakashima I. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1087-1091PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schneider R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 468-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Despite the overall low sequence identity, the conservation of a cadherin-like calcium-binding motif and a juxtamembrane cysteine-rich region in all RET extracellular domains indicates that they are phylogenetically related (18Hahn M. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree of RET extracellular domains, derived from dissimilarity scores of pairwise sequence alignments, is shown in Fig. 1. The extracellular region of Drosophila RET is clearly most divergent, whereas vertebrate RET sequences cluster into three main groups comprising the fish, chicken/Xenopus, and mammalian RET sequences, respectively (Fig. 1). Data base searches of theDrosophila genome did not return any sequences with significant similarity to mammalian GFRα receptors or GDNF family ligands, molecules known to bind and activate RET in vertebrates (1Airaksinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). 2J. Anders, S. Kjær, P. Lönnerberg, and C. F. Ibáñez, unpublished results. The divergence of the Drosophila RET sequence upstream of the cysteine-rich domain might reflect a different function of the RET receptor in this organism. One of the most distinctive features of the extracellular region of RET is the segment with similarity to the calcium-binding motif of cadherins. This was initially identified as a 110-residue-long sequence from positions 203–314 3To be consistent with previous literature, all RET amino acid numbering in this study starts at the initiator Met residue in the RET signal sequence. The first residue in the mature human RET polypeptide is Gly at position 28. in the extracellular region of vertebrate RET molecules displaying up to 40% sequence similarity with classical members of the cadherin family, including epithelial and neural cadherins. However, when mapped onto the crystal structures of epithelial and neural cadherin domains (9Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 10Overduin M. Harvey T.S. Bagby S. Tong K.I. Yau P. Takeichi M. Ikura M.

Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 12Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), the region of similarity to cadherins in RET does not correspond to a discrete cadherin but extends over the border of two consecutive domains including the intervening calcium-binding motif. This suggested that this segment of the RET molecule cannot represent a discrete structural domain of the protein and prompted us to extend the alignment of RET to cadherins both upstream and downstream of this region. Because of the repetitive organization of the ectodomain of cadherins, we hypothesized that the extracellular region of RET may also be organized by the repetitive arrangement of structurally related units. We derived a consensus sequence for the cadherin domain from a multiple sequence alignment of the extracellular regions of the classical epithelial and neural cadherins, for which three-dimensional crystal structures are available, and protocadherin 7, a more distant member of the cadherin superfamily (19Yoshida K. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Seki N. Sasaki M. Sugano S. Genomics. 1998; 49: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). The consensus sequence derived from the comparison of the different cadherin domains in these three molecules is shown at the bottom of Fig.2 A. At the top of Fig. 2 A, the seven prototypical strands of the cadherin fold are indicated (arrows mark strands A–G). Conserved features include a glutamic acid immediately C-terminal to strand A, a DXD motif C-terminal to strand B, a LDRE motif in the loop between strands E and F, and a negatively charged VXVXVXDXNDXXPXF motif in strand G. The majority of cadherin domains also have VXYXV (strand C), FXIE (strand D), and TGXL (strand E) motifs and a YXLXXAXD motif C-terminal to strand F. Within the most N-terminal cadherin domain of classical cadherins, a single glutamic acid residue is conserved in the loop between strands F and G. Not only is the actual sequence of these motifs conserved among cadherins and cadherin-related proteins, but also the distances separating them are almost identical among different family members. This consensus sequence is conserved to a varying degree among more distantly related members of the cadherin superfamily (for a detailed analysis of the human repertoire of the cadherin superfamily see Ref.8Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). As shown by the crystal structures of the first two domains of epithelial and neural cadherins (9Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 10Overduin M. Harvey T.S. Bagby S. Tong K.I. Yau P. Takeichi M. Ikura M.

Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), the cadherin domain adopts a β-sandwich fold, and calcium-binding sites are formed in between adjacent cadherin domains by the LDRE and DXND motifs of one domain and the DXD motif of the next one. The extracellular domain of cadherin molecules appears to be stabilized by the binding of multiple calcium ions (20Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The segment of similarity to cadherins previously identified in RET extended between the VXYXV motifs of two consecutive cadherin domains (dotted line in Fig.2 B). Visual inspection of flanking residues upstream and downstream of this segment in our multiple sequence alignment of RET ectodomains revealed many of the signature motifs of the cadherin consensus sequence as well as their respective spacing (Fig.2 B). This analysis delineated two consecutive cadherin-like domains (herein called CLD2 and CLD3, respectively) matching the consensus sequence of cadherin domains, extending from positions 166 to 387 in the mid-portion of the RET extracellular region (Figs.2 B and 3). CLD2 contains the conserved LDRE and DXND motifs, which, together with the conserved DXD motif from CLD3, could form a calcium-binding module similar to that found in classical and protocadherin molecules. Comparison of the multiple sequence alignment of RET ectodomains with the cadherin consensus sequence revealed the presence of two additional cadherin-like domains in the extracellular region of RET, one upstream of CLD2 from positions 28 to 156 (herein called CLD1) and another downstream of CLD3 from positions 401 to 516 (herein called CLD4) (Figs. 2 B and 3). Highly conserved spacer sequences were found between CLD1 and CLD2 and between CLD3 and CLD4, which could not be assigned to cadherin-related proteins (boxed in Fig.2 B). Interestingly, a spacer sequence is also found between the first and second cadherin domains of DN-cadherin, aDrosophila neuronal adhesion receptor (21Iwai Y. Usui T. Hirano S. Steward R. Takeichi M. Uemura T. Neuron. 1997; 19: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Within RET CLD1, hydrophobic as well as glycine and proline residues found in the cadherin consensus sequence and known to be of structural importance in the crystal structure of cadherin domains, are well conserved (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, the polar residues that form part of the calcium-binding site of repetitive cadherin domains are only partially conserved in CLD1 of RET (Fig.2 B). Together with the presence of a spacer sequence between CLD1 and CLD2 and the absence of the DXD motif in CLD2, this suggests that a calcium-binding site cannot be formed at the interface between CLD1 and CLD2. Compared with the other CLDs in RET and with classical cadherin domains, additional residues in the loop between strands E and F separate the LDRE and YXLXXAXD motifs in CLD1 (Fig.2 B). A similar feature can be found in several cadherin domains of protocadherins, including the N-terminal domains of protocadherins 1 and 7 (Fig. 2 A). Insertions within the consensus sequence seem to be a common property of a number of cadherin-related molecules. In the second cadherin domain of protocadherins 7 and 10, for example, glycine-rich sequences of up to 50 residues appear to be inserted in the loop between strands C and D, at a location where classic cadherins have a loop of 8–12 residues (8Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Thus, although RET CLD1 conserves several of the features of the classical cadherin consensus sequence, it also shares intriguing properties with N-terminal domains from more divergent members of the cadherin superfamily, including several protocadherins. In CLD4 sequences of RET from different species (Fig. 2 B) structurally important hydrophobic, glycine, and proline residues of the cadherin consensus sequence are well conserved. Similar to CLD1, polar residues contributing to the calcium-binding sites of repetitive cadherin domains are less conserved, suggesting that CLD3 and"

The molecule consists of two ubiquitin-like domains in tandem arrangement and bears a conserved diglycine motif at its carboxyl terminus commonly used in ubiquitin-like proteins for isopeptide linkage to conjugated proteins. We investigated the function of FAT10 by expressing murine FAT10 in a hemagglutinin-tagged wild type form as well as a diglycine-deficient mutant form in mouse fibroblasts in a tetracycline-repressible manner. FAT10 expression did not affect major histocompatibility complex class I cell surface expression or antigen presentation. However, we found that wild type but not mutant FAT10 caused apoptosis within 24 h of induction in a caspase-dependent manner as indicated by annexin V cell surface staining and DNA fragmentation. Wild type FAT10, but not its diglycine mutant, was covalently conjugated to thus far unidentified proteins, indicating that specific FAT10 activating and conjugating enzymes must be operative in unstimulated fibroblasts. Because FAT10 expression causes apoptosis and is inducible with tumor necrosis factor α, it may be functionally involved in the programmed cell death mediated by this cytokine.

In addition to modification by small molecules like orthophosphate, acetic acid, lipids, or sugars, the attachment of protein tags via isopeptide linkage to lysine residues in target proteins has recently been recognized as a frequently used and very diverse theme in cell biology. The prototype of such a protein tag is ubiquitin, which, when assembled as a polyubiquitin chain onto substrate proteins, can target these proteins to the 26S proteasome for degradation (1Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). Recently, it has become clear that the manner in which ubiquitin is linked in polyubiquitin chains defines the fate of the modified protein. The specific targeting signal for the proteasome pathway is a polyubiquitin chain that uses the K48 residue of the proximal ubiquitin as a target for further rounds of ubiquitination. The formation of K63-linked ubiquitin polymers, in contrast, does not lead to degradation but seems to play a role in DNA repair (2Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) and endocytosis (3Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conjugation of receptors with a single ubiquitin moiety can also serve as a signal for endocytosis (4Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), whereas in the case of histone H2B, monoubiquitination appears to regulate nucleosome function and cell division (5Robzyk K. Recht J. Osley M.A. Science. 2000; 287: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The specificity of substrate selection and the mode of ubiquitin conjugation are determined by an enzymatic cascade required for the activation and specific transfer of ubiquitin. It consists of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)1, which uses the energy of ATP to form a thioester linkage between a cysteine residue of the E1 enzyme and the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin consisting of two conserved glycine residues. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred onto a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (ubiquitin carrier protein; E2), which, in turn, can pass it directly onto the substrate protein or first to ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3), which then will catalyze the formation of the isopeptide linkage between ubiquitin and the specific substrate (6Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Over the past 5 years, the proteinacious tag theme has been extended by the discovery of numerous “ubiquitin-like proteins” (7Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 8Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). As their family name implies, these proteins contain domains with homology to ubiquitin ranging from 15% to 60% identity on the amino acid level. They can be grouped in two classes: (a) the ubiquitin-domain proteins, which contain ubiquitin-like domains but are not conjugated to other proteins; and (b) the ubiquitin-like modifiers (UBLs), which can be covalently conjugated to target proteins by specific enzymatic cascades similar to those used for ubiquitin conjugation (8Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 9Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Chiba T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 8: 503-512Google Scholar). A conserved feature of ubiquitin and UBLs that is required for conjugate formation is the diglycine motif situated either directly at the carboxyl terminus of the UBL or within the sequence of a UBL precursor, thus requiring carboxyl-terminal limited proteolysis for the liberation of the diglycine motif. A ubiquitin-like protein that, based on its primary structure, would qualify as a member of the UBL family is the FAT10 protein (10Liu Y. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (formerly called diubiquitin (11Fan W. Cai W. Parimoo S. Lennon G.G. Weissman S.M. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Bates E.F.M. Ravel O. Dieu M.C. Ho S. Guret C. Bridon J.M. AitYahia S. Briere F. Caux C. Banchereau J. Lebecque S. Eur.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 4030-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)). FAT10 is an 18-kDa protein consisting of two ubiquitin-like domains combined by a short linker. The amino-terminal domain of FAT10 is 29% identical to ubiquitin, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain displays a 36% identity to ubiquitin. Lysine residues corresponding to position 29, 48, and 63 of ubiquitin that could potentially serve as sites for conjugation are conserved in both domains and the carboxyl-terminal domain ends with a free diglycine motif, which is free for isopeptide linkage to target proteins. However, no experimental evidence for the formation of covalent conjugates of FAT10 has been obtained to date (10Liu Y. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus far, very little is known about the function of FAT10, although its expression pattern and genomic localization may provide some hints with regard to the pathways in which it may be functionally involved. The FAT10 gene was originally discovered by genomic sequencing and found to be localized in the MHC class I locus of the human and the mouse (11Fan W. Cai W. Parimoo S. Lennon G.G. Weissman S.M. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Initially, expression of FAT10 was found to be restricted to mature B cells and dendritic cells, suggesting that FAT10 may play a role in antigen presentation in professional antigen-presenting cells (12Bates E.F.M. Ravel O. Dieu M.C. Ho S. Guret C. Bridon J.M. AitYahia S. Briere F. Caux C. Banchereau J. Lebecque S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2471-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was found that FAT10 could be detected in a wide range of human cell lines when the cells were treated with the cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, but not with IFN-α (10Liu Y. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Raasi S. Schmidtke G. de Giuli R. Groettrup M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 4030-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IFN-γ and TNF-α displayed a strong synergism in their ability to induce FAT10 expression, possibly indicating that FAT10 may play a role in the signal transduction or effector functions of these two pro-inflammatory cytokines. In a two-hybrid screen, Liu et al. (10Liu Y. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) found an interaction of FAT10 with spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2. The interaction of FAT10 and MAD2, which appears to be noncovalent, could be confirmed in glutathione S- transferase pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation experiments, but a functional implication of FAT10 in anaphase arrest has not been reported to date. Thus far, there are no cell lines or mice available that lack or overexpress mutant or wild type forms of FAT10. We previously tried to overexpress the human FAT10 protein in stable transfectants of HeLa cells; however, of 15 clones that had integrated the FAT10 expression construct into their genomic DNA, only 1 clone expressed FAT10 mRNA at a level sufficient for detection in Northern analysis. Remarkably, this clone suffered from continuous cell death and poor proliferation (13Raasi S. Schmidtke G. de Giuli R. Groettrup M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 4030-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The viability only improved when cells emerged in culture that had lost FAT10 expression. This observation suggested that stable overexpression of FAT10 was incompatible with the survival of cells. Therefore, we decided to express a wild type form of murine FAT10 as well as a mutant form that lacked the carboxyl-terminal diglycine motif in a tetracycline (tet)-repressible manner in mouse fibroblasts. Overexpression of FAT10 but not the carboxyl-terminal mutant induced apoptosis in transfectants within 24 h after removal of tet. The induction of FAT10 expression resulted in the appearance of a monomeric FAT10 protein as well as several proteins of higher molecular weight that were not formed in the ΔGG mutant, strongly suggesting that FAT10 can become covalently conjugated to thus far unidentified target proteins. Therefore, FAT10 is a functional member of the family of ubiquitin-like modifiers. The expression vectors pTET-tTA (which contains the tet-regulated tTA transcription activator) and pTet-Splice have been described previously (14Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). An influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) tag was cloned in frame at the 5′-end of murine FAT10 cDNA. This construct was cloned into the pTet-Splice plasmid viaHindIII and SpeI restriction sites using standard methods. pLXSP and pLXSH are plasmids containing puromycin and hygromycin resistance genes, respectively. The ΔGG mutant of FAT10 was generated with site-directed mutagenesis using PCR with the 3′-oligonucleotide 5′-GCCCTCTAGACTCAGGCCGCAGTGCAGTGTGTT-3′, in which the nucleotides encoding for two glycine residues are replaced by the amino acids AACV. The 5′-oligonucleotide was the same as that used for wild type cDNA and is described later. The sequences were verified via dedesoxy sequencing. B8-E11, a subclone from the B8 murine fibroblast cell line expressing murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) IE1 protein pp89 (15Groettrup M. Ruppert T. Kuehn L. Seeger M. Standera S. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23808-23815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), was transfected with pTet-tTAk and pLXSH constructs by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. Clones were selected with hygromycin B (400 μg/ml) in medium containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline. The presence of tTAk was confirmed by genomic PCR analysis using the oligonucleotides 5′-ATGTCTAGATTAGATAAAAGTAAAG-3′ and 5′-CTACCCACCGTACTCGTCAA-3′, which were specific for the coding sequence of the transactivator gene. The tet-dependent repression of tTAk expression was verified by transient transfection of these cells with a luciferase reporter gene, which was cloned into the pTet-Splice vector (14Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). B8tTA.F4, a clone that showed high tTAk expression in the absence of tet but very low tTAK expression in the presence of tet, was selected as a recipient for further experiments. B8tTA.F4 cells were transfected with either pTet-Splice/HA-FAT10 (wt) and pLXSP or pTet-Splice/HA-FAT10-ΔGG (mutant) and pLXSP as described above. Puromycin-resistant clones were isolated and cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 400 μg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem), 5 μg/ml puromycin (Calbiochem), and 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). The integration of the HA-FAT10-wt and HA-FAT10-ΔGG cDNAs into the genome was confirmed by genomic PCR analysis using the described oligonucleotides. The expression of the HA-FAT10 proteins was induced by removing tetracycline from the medium with at least three washes with phosphate-buffered saline and examined by immunoblot analysis. One clone expressing wild type HA-FAT10 (TB1N) and one clone expressing HA-FAT10-ΔGG (mTB14) were chosen for most of the experiments because they showed a high tet-dependent expression of either wt HA-FAT10 or HA-FAT10-ΔGG. The following antibodies were used: anti-HA (HA probe F-7, sc-7392; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ubiquitin (DAKO), anti-human actin (carboxyl-terminal peptide; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-mouse IgG POD (DAKO), anti-CD95 (Immunotech), anti-CD29 (clone HMβ1-1; PharMingen), goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Alexa 546; Molecular Probes), anti-H2-Ld (mAb clone 28-14-81), anti-H2-Kd (mAb clone 15-5-5S), anti-H2-Dd (mAb clone 19/191), and anti-LCMV glycoprotein (mAb clone KL25). For one-dimensional Laemmli SDS-PAGE, total cell lysates were prepared using the following lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% SDS, and 0.85 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The solubilized cell pellet was freeze-thawed four times and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 ×g. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by absorption at 280 nm, assuming that 1 OD = 1 mg/ml. 50 μg of total protein was loaded per lane. For non-equilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis (NEPHGE)/SDS-PAGE, about 3 × 106 cells were lysed in 100 μl of NEPHGE sample buffer, incubated for 3 h at room temperature under agitation, and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to gels, and NEPHGE/SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (16Groettrup M. Kraft R. Kostka S. Standera S. Stohwasser R. Kloetzel P.-M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Western blotting was performed as described elsewhere (17Schwarz K. de Giuli R. Schmidtke G. Kostka S. van den Broek M. Kim K. Crews C.M. Kraft R. Groettrup M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6147-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A wild type HA-FAT10 transfectant (TB1N) and a diglycin mutant (mTB14) were prepared for microscopy in the presence and absence of tetracycline. 24 h after induction, cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized in PB buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 2% fetal calf serum, 5 mm EDTA, 1% saponin, and 0.1% NaN3) for 30 min. Incubations with primary antibody (anti-HA diluted 1:100 in PB buffer) and secondary antibody (Alexa 546 diluted 1:1000 in PB buffer) were each for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed twice after each incubation with PB buffer. At the end, cells were washed with MACS buffer (PB buffer without saponin) and embedded in Mowiol (Sigma). To test the specificity of the anti-HA antibody, this antibody was omitted in control stainings. For quantification of H-2Ld-restricted presentation of the T-cell epitopes MCMV pp89/168–176 and LCMV NP118, specific T-cell hybridomas that express a β-galactosidase reporter gene under the control of the interleukin 2 promoter were used. T-cell activation can therefore be monitored using a colorimetric lacZ assay as described previously (17Schwarz K. de Giuli R. Schmidtke G. Kostka S. van den Broek M. Kim K. Crews C.M. Kraft R. Groettrup M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6147-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For determining pp89 presentation, nonviable cells were washed off the plate, and adherent TB1N cells were collected with calcium/magnesium-free medium 0, 24, and 48 h after the induction of FAT10 expression and used directly as antigen-presenting cells in the assay. To measure NP118 presentation, we infected TB1N cells with 0.01 plaque-forming unit of LCMV strain WE for 1 day, and then FAT10 expression was induced for 0, 24, or 48 h. Induced and uninduced cells were used in parallel as antigen-presenting cells in the hybridoma assay. No significant differences were recorded between induced and uninduced cells in two independent experiments for either the MCMV pp89 epitope or the LCMV NP118 epitope. The expression of FAT10 was induced in TB1N and mTB14 cells. Uninduced and induced cells were harvested with calcium/magnesium-free medium at the indicated time points, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained for annexin V using the ApoAlert Annexin V Apoptosis Kit (CLONTECH). Jurkat cells incubated with anti-CD95 antibody (7C11; Immunotech) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml for 6 h were used as positive control. For determination of MHC class I cell surface expression, TB1N cells were stained 0, 24, and 48 h after the removal of tet from the growth medium with mAbs anti-H2-Ld, anti-H2-Kd, anti-H2-Dd, and anti-CD29 (as control) and subsequently stained with goat anti-mouse Ig-Fab-fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody (Silenus, Victoria, Australia). For cell cycle analysis, nuclei were prepared from TB1N cells 0, 24, and 48 h after the induction of FAT10 expression, and nuclei were stained with propidium iodide exactly as described previously (18Schmidtke G. Holzhütter H. Bogyo M. Kairies N. Groll M. de Giuli R. Emch S. Groettrup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35734-35740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Fluorescence of cells or nuclei was analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer and LYSIS II software (Becton Dickinson). TB1N and mTB14N clones were induced to express FAT10 for 24, 48, and 72 h. To determine caspase sensitivity, cells were cultivated without tet for 24 h in the presence or absence of 25 μm of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland). A pellet of 107cells was resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 mg/ml proteinase K) and digested for 2 h at 37 °C. After standard phenol/chloroform extraction, nucleic acids were precipitated in 70% ethanol/500 mm NaCl, washed in 70% ethanol, and resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer containing 100 mg/ml RNase A. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, about 5 μg of DNA was analyzed for fragmentation on a 1.5% agarose/ethidium bromide gel. As a positive control, we used Jurkat cells incubated for 6 h with anti-CD95 antibody as described above in the presence or absence of 25 μm Z-VAD-fmk. TB1N cells were induced to express FAT10. The uninduced and induced cells were harvested after 24, 48, and 72 h, and total RNA was isolated according to the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform procedure (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription of 5 μg of total RNA was performed at 42 °C for 1 h using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT)15 (Promega). The synthesized cDNA was precipitated with ethanol and washed with 70% ethanol, and the cDNA was resuspended in 20 μl of H2O. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed with the Light Cycler (Roche) using DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche) according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Sense and antisense primers used for PCR amplification were as follows: 5′- GATAAGGTACCTATGGCTTCTGTCCGCACCTGTG-3′ and 5′-GCCCTCTAGACTCATCCCCCAGTGCAGTGTGTTG-3′ (used for FAT10 cDNA at an annealing temperature of 57 °C) and 5′- TCCTGACCCTGAAGTACC-3′ and 5′- TTGCCAATAGTGATGACC-3′ (used for mouse β-actin cDNA at an annealing temperature of 60 °C). The amount of cDNA was normalized using β-actin as the standard. Different dilutions of TB1N cDNA with the highest expression of FAT10 were prepared and used to obtain a calibration curve. The coefficient after linear regression wasr = 1. Cells were collected 0, 24, and 48 h after the induction of FAT10 expression and stained with 1% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline. Viable cells that excluded the dye and blue cells that were scored as dead cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber. The previous failure to stably overexpress human FAT10 in HeLa cells suggested that ectopic FAT10 expression may adversely affect cellular growth or survival (13Raasi S. Schmidtke G. de Giuli R. Groettrup M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 4030-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,10Liu Y. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to express the FAT10 mRNA in a cell line under the control of a tet-repressible promoter, which would allow the generation and expansion of transfectants in the absence of FAT10 expression and enable us to study the functional consequences of inducing FAT10 expression simply by removing tet from the growth medium. The localization of the FAT10 gene in the MHC class I locus and the finding that FAT10 expression was synergistically inducible with IFN-γ and TNF-α suggested that FAT10 may play a role in MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation. Because we have established murine T-cell hybridomas that allow us to monitor the MHC class I-restricted presentation of several viral antigens by murine cell lines (20Schwarz K. van den Broek M. de Giuli R. Seelentag W.W. Shastri N. Groettrup M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 237: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we decided to examine the consequence of FAT10 expression for antigen presentation in the murine system. The mouse fibroblast cell line B8 (15Groettrup M. Ruppert T. Kuehn L. Seeger M. Standera S. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23808-23815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) was first stably transfected with the expression construct pTet-tTAk, which encodes a tet-responsive transcriptional inducer (14Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The transfectants were tested by transient transfection of tet-regulated β-galactosidase or luciferase reporter constructs, and a clone designated B8tTA.F4 was selected that showed a strong expression of β-galactosidase and luciferase in the absence of tet but very little expression of β-galactosidase and luciferase in the presence of tet (data not shown). Next, we performed two stable transfections of B8tTA.F4 with two different tet-responsive FAT10 expression constructs. The first construct encoded the full-length murine FAT10 cDNA fused to an HA tag at the amino terminus. The second construct encoded an HA-tagged mutant form of murine FAT10 (FAT10-ΔGG), in which the carboxyl-terminal diglycine motif was replaced by the amino acids AACV. During transfection of B8tTA.F4 cells, 76 and 36 clones were scored positive by genomic PCR for the wt and mutant FAT10, respectively. Western analysis of all clones with αHA antibodies revealed FAT10 expression in the absence of tet but not in the presence of tet in about half of the clones, of which a few representative clones are shown in Fig.1. All clones of the wt and ΔGG series showed an HA-reactive band at about 21 kDa, corresponding to the expected molecular mass of the HA-FAT10 proteins. Interestingly, a very prominent band of about 35 kDa appeared in all FAT10 wt clones in the absence of tet but not in the presence of tet. None of the ΔGG clones showed this band, suggesting that the appearance of this band apparently depended on the two carboxyl-terminal glycine residues of FAT10. Because this protein resisted boiling in the presence of mercaptoethanol and SDS, we conclude that the 35-kDa band is not due to thioester linkage of FAT10 to putative E1 or E2, but that it most likely represents an isopeptide-linked conjugate between the FAT10 protein and a thus far unidentified target protein. In parallel to the stable transfection of the B8tTA.F4 clone, we had transfected another mouse fibroblast line named Mec29, which also expressed the tet-responsive transcriptional inducer (21Sijts A.J.A.M. Standera S. Toes R.E.M. Ruppert T. Beekman N.J.C.M. van Veelen P.A. Ossendorp F.A. Melief C.J.M. Kloetzel P.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4500-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with the same FAT10 expression constructs. The result obtained was the same as that obtained in the B8tTA.F4 transfectants, namely, the appearance of FAT10 as well as an additional 35-kDa band in the wt transfectants but not in the ΔGG transfectants (data not shown). We wondered whether the 35-kDa band could be a dimer of FAT10, and we decided to investigate this possibility with help of αHA Western analysis of two-dimensional NEPHGE/SDS-PAGE, with the prediction that a FAT10 dimer should migrate with the same charge in the first dimension as the monomer. For further analysis, we selected the wt FAT10 clone TB1N and the ΔGG mutant clone mTB14, which were representative in the expression of the respective forms of FAT10 proteins. Due to the better resolution of the two-dimensional gels shown in Fig.2, it became apparent that the fairly broad HA-reactive band at around 35 kDa was in fact composed from a number of different proteins (Fig. 2, top right panel) that appeared in the wt FAT10 transfectant after the induction of FAT10 expression (− tet) but did not appear in the ΔGG mutant or in the absence of FAT10 expression (+ tet). Interestingly, some of these putative FAT10 conjugates migrated as a series of differently charged spots, as was observed for the FAT10 monomer itself. The appearance and distance of the differently charged FAT10 spots would be consistent with a covalent modification of FAT10 by phosphorylation, but we have not yet addressed this issue experimentally. The molecular weight and charge of the putative conjugates would be compatible with one of them being a FAT10 dimer. However, none of them (labeled with arrows in Fig. 2) occurred in the ΔGG mutant, even after overexposure. The latter finding would argue against FAT10 dimer formation because the transfectants endogenously express murine FAT10 (data not shown), which should be available for isopeptide linkage to the ectopically expressed FAT10. Nevertheless, at present, we cannot rule out dimer formation, and identification of the conjugated proteins will be required to resolve this issue. Covalent conjugation of the well-characterized ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO-1 to the PML protein has recently been found to cause a localization of the PML-SUMO-1 conjugate in the so-called PML bodies in the nucleus (22Müller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This finding was an incentive for us to examine using fluorescence microscopy where FAT10 is localized in mouse fibroblast transfectants and whet"
https://openalex.org/W2017659962,"Sphingolipids have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and programmed cell death. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) has recently emerged as an important lipid messenger and a ligand for the endothelial differentiation gene receptor family of proteins through which it mediates its biologic effects. Recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in our laboratory implicated the yeast oligomycin resistance gene (YOR1), a member of the ATP binding cassette family of proteins, in the transport of SPP. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator is a unique member of the ATP binding cassette transporter family and has high homology with YOR1. We therefore set out to investigate if this member of the family can regulate SPP transport. We demonstrate that C127/cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) cells, expressing wild type CFTR, exhibited significantly higher uptake of sphingosine 1-phosphate than either cells expressing a mutant CFTR C127/ΔF508 or C127/mock-transfected cells. This effect was specific, dose-dependent, and competed off by dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate and lysophosphatidic acid. There was no difference in uptake of sphingosine, C16-ceramide, sphingomyelin, lysophingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidic acid among the different cell lines. Pretreatment with forskolin or isobutylmethylxanthine to stimulate cAMP did not affect the uptake in any of the cell lines. Moreover, we found that mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by SPP was less responsive in C127/CFTR as compared with C127/mock-transfected cells, suggesting that uptake of SPP by CFTR may divert it from interacting with its cell surface receptors and attenuate signaling functions. Taken together, these data implicate CFTR in uptake of SPP and the related phosphorylated lipids dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate and lysophosphatidic acid. This uptake influences the availability of SPP to modulate biologic activity via endothelial differentiation gene receptors. These studies may have important implications to cystic fibrosis.

SPP has been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes, including calcium mobilization, cell proliferation, and suppression of apoptosis (7Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In recent studies using Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism and regulation, we found that a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins, namely yeast oligomycin resistance gene (YOR1), endowed resistance to sphingosine. The mechanism of this appeared to occur by pumping SPP out of yeast cells and consequently preventing its accumulation and its toxic effects. 2C. Mao and L. Obeid, unpublished data. ABC transporters define a family of proteins with strong structural similarities conserved across evolution and devoted to the translocation of a variety of substrates across cell membranes. Other members of the ABC family have been implicated in the transport of lipids. The multidrug resistance protein (MDR2) functions as a phosphatidylcholine transporter (8Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and multidrug resistance (MRP1) acts as glutathione conjugate transporter (9Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27807-27810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another important member of this family is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein. Cystic fibrosis is a lethal autosomal recessive disease affecting 1 in 3000 newborns in the United States alone. The disease is caused by mutations (10Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) affecting the gene that encodes the CFTR. Over 700 mutations are known, of which the most common mutation is ΔF508, which affects the ability of fully translated CFTR to exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is synthesized (10Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). CFTR is composed of five domains (11Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Ianuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar): two membrane-spanning domains, two nucleotide-binding domains, and a regulatory domain. There is a high percentage of homology between Yor1 and CFTR based on amino acid sequence and hydropathy profile: 28 and 38.7%, respectively. Because of these similarities, we wondered if CFTR is involved in sphingolipid transport. In this report we demonstrate that C127 murine epithelial cells transfected with wild type CFTR (C127/CFTR) exhibit significantly greater uptake of sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP), dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (dhSPP), and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) than C127/mock cells transfected with the vector only (C127/mock) or cells transfected with the ΔF508 mutant CFTR (C127/ΔF508). This effect is specific and dose-dependent. Pretreatment with forskolin or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to stimulate cAMP did not affect the uptake in any of the cell lines. Moreover, MAP kinase activation by SPP was less responsive in C127/CFTR cells as compared with C127/mock-transfected cells, suggesting that CFTR diverts SPP from interaction with the EDG receptors. In addition C127/CFTR cells grew slower, but had equal expression of EDG receptors as compared with C127/mock cells. Therefore, we propose that CFTR regulates the uptake and cellular activity of SPP, dhSPP, and LPA. Murine C127 epithelial cells stably transfected with the wild-type human CFTR cDNA, the ΔF508 mutant CFTR, and a mock-transfected control line were from the laboratory of Dr. Jon Cohn. It has been demonstrated, using both molecular and functional approaches, that C127/CFTR wt and C127/CFTR ΔF508 cells express normal and mutated CFTR, respectively (12Dechecchi M.C. Tamanini A. Berton G. Cabrini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11321-11325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 400 μg/ml Geneticin G418 (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Quiescence was achieved by placing the 60–70% confluent cell cultures in DMEM with 0.1% FBS for 24–48 h. C127 CFTR wt, CFTRΔF508, and mock cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured as described earlier at 37 °C to obtain a final density of 8 × 104 to 1.0 × 105 cells/well. The cells were then incubated for 0–60 min with or without one of the following radiolabeled lipids: [3H]sphingosine 1-phosphate (5 μCi), [3H]dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (5 μCi), [3H]sphingosine (5 μCi), [3H]C16-ceramide (1 μCi), [3H]lysophosphatidic acid (1 μCi), [14C]sphingomyelin (5 μCi), [3H]phosphatidylcholine (5 μCi), [3H]lysophosphatidylcholine (5 μCi), [3H]lysosphingomyelin (5 μCi), or palmitic acid (5 μCi) at 37 °C in growth medium containing G418. The incubation with SPP was done with a mixture of cold SPP (0.01 μm, 0.3 μm, 1 μm,) and [3H]SPP (5 μCi). At the desired time points, the medium was removed and cells washed with PBS. The cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. In each experiment, two wells were kept for protein determination. The counts were adjusted to the amount of protein. In additional experiments, cells were pretreated with or without IBMX (500 μm) or forskolin (30 μm) for 30 min prior to incubation with [3H]dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (0.5, 1, and 50 μm) for 0–60 min. C127 wt and mock-transfected cells were seeded at a density of 2–4 × 105 cells/well in T6 well plates. Quiescent cells were stimulated with SPP (0.1, 1, 2.5, and 5 μm) or PDGF-AB (10 ng/ml) for 10 min. In some cases cells were pretreated with PD098059 (10 ng/ml) for 60 min prior to stimulation with SPP. Cells were suspended in 150 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and homogenized by repeatedly (three times) passing through a 0.24-mm gauge syringe. Protein samples (20–25 μg) were loaded on a 12% Ready-gel (Bio-Rad) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins in the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal phosphospecific MAPK antibodies that specifically recognize Tyr204-phosphorylated (but not nonphosphorylated) p42mapk and p44mapk (New England Biolabs). The phospho-MAPK antibody was used at a 1:1000 dilution, whereas the control antibody, which recognizes total MAPK, was used at 1:2000 dilution. The membranes were incubated overnight with the antibodies in antibody buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat milk), washed, and exposed to anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:2500) in antibody buffer for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were revealed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak Biomax-MR film. C127/CFTR wt and C127/mock cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in T12 well plates at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 0.1, 2, 5, or 10% fetal bovine serum. Duplicates were done for each well. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, the cells were washed with PBS, released with trypsin/EDTA, incubated with trypan blue, and counted using a hemocytometer. Total RNAs were isolated from C127/wt CFTR and C127/mock-transfected cells with the Rneasy Mini kit (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. The intactness of RNA samples was confirmed by running them on denaturing agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide as described previously (14Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 374-376PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (1 μg) was then used in reverse transcriptase reactions to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) using Promega's avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase with random primers (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. The resulting total cDNA was used in PCR usingTaq polymerase (Qiagen) to measure the mRNA levels of EDG-1, -3, and -5 receptor genes. The primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) used for PCR amplification were: 5′-AGCCCTCTCGGACCTATTAGC-3′ and 5′-TTGCAGCCCACATCTAACAGT-3′ for EDG-1 (15Zhang G. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); 5′-CAGGGAGGGCAGTATGTTCGT-3′ and 5′-GGGTTCATGGCCGAGTTGAG-3′ for EDG-3 (15Zhang G. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); 5′-CATTGCCATTGAGCGACACC-3′ and 5′-TTGACTAGACAGCCGCACACC-3′ for EDG-5 (15Zhang G. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); 5′-TTACCAAAAGTGGCCCACTA and 5′-GAAAGATGGTGAACTATGCC for r-RNA (16Ogretmen B. McCauley M.D. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11679-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed for 30 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 58 °C for 45 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 50 s. PCR products (10 μl) were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis after staining with ethidium bromide. For EDG-5 we increased the number of cycles to 35, decreased the annealing temperature to 55 °C, and loaded 22 μl of PCR product. The mRNA levels of EDG-1, -3, and -5 receptor genes were normalized to the rRNA levels used as internal controls. The linearity of amplification for EDG-1, -3, and -5 r-RNA genes was determined separately by using increasing concentrations of cDNAs on each PCR. d-Erythrodihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (Avanti), was dissolved in ethanol at concentrations of 100 μm and 1 mm. [3H]d-Erythrodihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate, [3H]sphingosine 1-phosphate, [3H]C16-ceramide, [3H]lysophosphatidic acid, [14C]sphingomyelin, [3H]lysophosphatidylcholine, [3H]lysosphingomyelin, and [3H]palmitic acid were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemical, Inc.d-Erythrosphingosine 1-phosphate (Avanti) was prepared as a 2 mm stock in Me2SO. LPA (Avanti), Lyso-PC (Avanti), and Lyso-SM (Avanti) were reconstituted in DMEM at 1 mm and sonicated for 90 s. To determine if CFTR affects the uptake of SPP, we evaluated the uptake of SPP in two lines of C127 murine cells: C127/CFTR cells transfected with wild type CFTR, and C127/mock cells transfected with empty vector. C127/CFTR cells exhibited significantly greater time-dependent uptake of [3H]SPP (1 μm) as compared with mock cells (Fig. 1 A) whereby the difference in the uptake of [3H]SPP occurred at 15 min and continued to increase until 60 min. Therefore, the overexpression of CFTR enhances the uptake of SPP by cells. The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis involves deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 and is named ΔF508, where the CFTR protein does not reach the cellular membrane. We examined the uptake of SPP in C127/CFTR and C127/ΔF508 cells. Interestingly, the C127/ΔF508 cells demonstrated significantly lower uptake of [3H]SPP as compared with the C127/CFTR cells and appeared to resemble the mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). Next, a dose-response study of [3H]SPP uptake was undertaken. Uptake of SPP in C127/CFTR cells increased with increasing concentration of SPP and reached a plateau at around 80 μm, possibly saturating the uptake mechanism (Fig.1 C). Taken together, these results demonstrate a time- and concentration-dependent uptake of [3H]SPP induced by CFTR overexpression. Further investigations were performed to characterize SPP uptake by the CFTR protein. dhSPP, which lacks the double bond at the C4–C5 position of SPP, is a structurally related sphingolipid and a SPP receptor agonist. dhSPP has been shown to be as potent as SPP in activation of DNA synthesis, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, and cell migration (17Sato K. Ui M. Okajima F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 85: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We wondered if it was also taken up by CFTR as well. Similar to SPP, the uptake of [3H]dhSPP (1 μm) by C127/CFTR cells was significantly greater as compared with mock and mutant cells (Fig.2 A). LPA and SPP are also structurally related lipid mediators that share the same receptor family, namely the EDG family of proteins, albeit with different specificities. We therefore next tested whether LPA was taken up as was SPP in C127/CFTR cells. The uptake of [3H]LPA in C127/CFTR cells was significantly greater as compared with mock and mutant cells at 1 μm (Fig.2 B). Similar to SPP, the uptake of LPA between the three cell lines was significantly different at 15 min of incubation. Further investigation was aimed at determining the relationship between the uptake of SPP and that of dhSPP and of LPA. For these studies, cells were incubated with 100 μm [3H]SPP and the uptake of SPP was evaluated in the presence of increasing concentrations of dhSPP or of LPA. The results showed that the uptake of SPP was competed off by dhSPP in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that dhSPP and SPP probably share the same mechanism of uptake. Similarly, LPA was able to compete off the uptake of SPP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 D). To examine whether the difference in uptake between cells expressing CFTR and the other cell lines was specific to SPP, we investigated the uptake of other sphingolipid compounds in C127/CFTR, C127/mock cells, and C127/ΔF508. All three cell lines showed a rapid but similar uptake of [3H]sphingosine, [3H]C16-ceramide, [14C]sphingomyelin, [3H]palmitic acid, [3H]lysophosphatidylcholine, [3H]lysosphingomyelin, and [3H]phosphatidylcholine (TableI). It is likely that incorporation into the membrane lipid bilayer accounts for some of the uptake of these lipids, especially sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine, which form a significant component of the cellular membrane. CFTR did not affect the uptake of any of these lipids, indicating that the effect of CFTR on uptake of [3H]SPP, [3H]dhSPP, and [3H]LPA is specific.Table ISpecificity of uptake of different lipidsC127/CFTR wtC127/mockC127/mutant[3H]C16-Ceramide0.33 ± 0.0020.35 ± 0.0030.274 ± 0.12[3H]Palmitic acid2.16 ± 0.4132.17 ± 0.232.42 ± 0.31[3H]Sphingosine0.97 ± 0.2701.3 ± 0.231.06 ± 0.18[3H]Phosphatidylcholine1.13 ± 0.081.26 ± 0.0231.13 ± 0.14[14C]Sphingomyelin2.33 ± 0.062.43 ± 0.162.40 ± 0.41[3H]Lysosphingomyelin0.63 ± 0.030.64 ± 0.020.67 ± 0.021[3H]Lysophosphatidylcholine0.66 ± 0.0210.68 ± 0.0310.67 ± 0.024Uptake assay using different structurally related lipids was done with C127/CFTR, C127/F508, and C127/mock cells: sphingosine (1 μm), C16-ceramide (1 μm), palmitic acid (1 μm), sphingomyelin (1 μm), phosphatidylcholine (1 μm), lysophosphatidylcholine (1 μm), and lysosphingomyelin (1 μm). All values are expressed as picomoles/mg of protein/min. Open table in a new tab Uptake assay using different structurally related lipids was done with C127/CFTR, C127/F508, and C127/mock cells: sphingosine (1 μm), C16-ceramide (1 μm), palmitic acid (1 μm), sphingomyelin (1 μm), phosphatidylcholine (1 μm), lysophosphatidylcholine (1 μm), and lysosphingomyelin (1 μm). All values are expressed as picomoles/mg of protein/min. CFTR forms a chloride channel that is activated by protein kinase A and is therefore regulated by cAMP. Forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, and IBMX, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, stimulate chloride secretion by wild-type CFTR through cAMP pathway. To evaluate if the uptake of dhSPP by CFTR is cAMP-dependent, we incubated cells with forskolin (20 μm) and IBMX (2 mm) and tested whether the uptake of dhSPP was affected. Pretreatment of C127/CFTR cells with or without IBMX and forskolin did not affect the uptake of [3H]dhSPP (data not shown). These data indicate that uptake of dhSPP may be regulated by the CFTR protein, and that this regulation is not through the cAMP-dependent chloride channel. It has been recently demonstrated that SPP is a ligand for the EDG-1 receptor using a highly sensitive radioligand binding assay (2Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). dhSPP competitively inhibited [32P]SPP binding with potency almost as great as that of unlabeled SPP (2Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 18Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), suggesting that dhSPP and SPP both act through the same members of the EDG-receptor family. There is also increasing evidence that many cellular effects elicited by SPP are mediated by the EDG receptor family (EDG-1, EDG-3, EDG-5, and EDG-8). Mitogen-activated protein kinases p42mapk and p44mapk are activated in cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor and other agents. Exogenous SPP rapidly stimulates the activation of the MAP kinase pathway by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism (19Wu J. Spiegel S. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of G protein-coupled EDG receptors. In Swiss 3T3 cells (20Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), sphingosine and SPP are growth stimulatory at low concentrations via mobilization of calcium stores and activation of the MAP kinase pathway. dhSPP was as potent as SPP in p38 MAP kinase and ERK activation (21Tamama K. Kon J. Sato K. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Kanda T. Ohta H. Ui M. Kobayashi I. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To test the MAP kinase pathway in the C127-transfected cells, we examined the effects of overexpression of CFTR on the activation of MAPK. Since the uptake of SPP, dhSPP, and LPA by CFTR was similar, we elected to focus the rest of our studies on the biologic aspects of SPP response in the different cell lines. First, we demonstrated that platelet-derived growth factor PDGF-AB (10 ng/ml, 10 min) stimulated p42mapk and p44mapk equally in C127/CFTR and C127/mock cells (Fig. 3 A). Next, phosphorylation of MAP kinase in response to SPP in these cells was examined. Fig. 3 (B and C) shows that SPP activated p42mapk and p44mapk in a dose-dependent manner in both C127/CFTR and C127/mock cells. However, SPP-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK was significantly higher in C127/mock as compared with C127/CFTR. The difference was observed at low concentrations starting at 1 μm, and became more pronounced at higher concentrations of 5 μm (1.75 times). Indeed, at 1 and 2.5 μm, SPP induced MAPK phosphorylation by 1.6- and 1.7-fold, whereas it barely exerted an effect in the C127/CFTR cells (Fig. 3 C). PD098059, a known inhibitor of the ERK-2 signaling pathway, diminished SPP-stimulated activation of p42mapk and p44mapk seen on immunoblots (Fig.3 D), indicating that this stimulation by SPP is specific to the MAP kinase pathway. Those results demonstrate that overexpression of CFTR interferes with the SPP/EDG/MAPK pathway, possibly through diverting SPP to intracellular pools. It was of interest to determine whether the SPP receptors EDG-1, EDG-3, and EDG-5 are expressed in C127 mouse mammary epithelial cells and whether the expression level is similar in C127/CFTR and C127/mock. Serial dilutions of cDNAs were used in RT-PCR to confirm the linearity of PCR amplifications. The mRNA levels of EDG-3 and EDG-5 receptor genes were normalized to rRNA levels used as internal controls in these cells. RT-PCR analysis clearly demonstrated that mRNA levels of EDG-3 and EDG-5 receptor genes were similar in C127/CFTR and C127/mock cells (Fig. 4). The EDG-1 mRNA levels, however, were undetectable in either cell line. SPP, dhSPP, and LPA are serum-borne lipids present in serum-supplemented culture media, and they exert a number of biological activities seen with serum stimulation, such as proliferation, survival, stress fiber formation, cell rounding, and cell migration (22Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Thangada S. Thompson B.D. Kluk M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The serum content of SPP in inactivated fetal bovine serum (56 °C for 30 min) and in human serum was estimated as 162 and 922 nm, respectively (23Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Okajima F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). LPA and SPP have been suggested as the main components of serum responsible for the mitogenic effects of serum. LPA can prevent serum-deprivation induced apoptosis in fibroblasts and other cell types (24Fang X., Yu, S. LaPushin R. Lu Y. Furui T. Penn L.Z. Stokoe D. Erickson J.R. Bast Jr., R.C. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wondered if the uptake of these lipids by C127/CFTR cells decreases their availability in serum, and if this would affect the growth of these cell lines. Therefore, the growth rate of C127/CFTR and C127/mock-transfected cells was determined at different concentrations of fetal bovine serum. C127/mock-transfected cells grew better (at 48 h) than C127/CFTR at different concentrations of FBS (Fig.5 A). The difference in the growth rate was more significant in medium supplemented with higher concentrations of FBS, such that at 10% FBS there was a 2.9-fold difference in growth (Fig. 4 A). In a time-dependent growth assay, the difference in the growth rate between C127/CFTR and C127/mock was seen at early as well as late time points (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, the overexpression of CFTR modulates the growth response of these cells to increasing concentration of serum. These results show that CFTR enhances the uptake of SPP. This uptake was specific and dose-dependent. dhSPP and LPA, structurally related lipids, were also selectively taken up by C127/CFTR and were able to compete with the uptake of SPP. Cells overexpressing the CFTR protein, despite expressing equal amounts of EDG receptors, demonstrated decreased SPP-mediated MAP kinase activation and grew slower than mock-transfected cells. Two important implications of this study are that CFTR regulates uptake of SPP and the structurally related lipids dhSPP and LPA, and that this uptake modulates the response of cells to these lipids. Our data clearly demonstrate that SPP uptake has significant consequences on regulation of cellular responses to SPP. In the presence of CFTR, SPP uptake is increased, thus leaving less SPP available for interaction with EDG receptors. Consequently cells that express functional CFTR may be less responsive to SPP-mediated biology through the EDG receptors, such as proliferation, cell migration, and angiogenesis. In addition, cells that express functional CFTR may be more susceptible to intracellular effects of SPP, which include both apoptotic and antiapoptotic effects. It is clear from our data that CFTR-mediated uptake of SPP is not the only mechanism for its uptake, as there is some evidence in the literature for intracellular effects of SPP in cells that may or may not express CFTR. These data may, however, have important implications on the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by recurrent and chronic bacterial infection and inflammation. Chronic infection and angiogenesis are related in that one leads to the other, and a cycle of inflammation and angiogenesis is perpetuated. Excessive angiogenesis has been noted in cystic fibrosis tissues (25McColley S.A. Stellmach V. Boas S.R. Jain M. Crawford S.E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 1877-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Several proangiogenic molecules have been described including vascular endothelial cell growth factor (26Griffioen A.W. Molema G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 237-268PubMed Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor elevation is related to airway infection; serum vascular endothelial cell growth factor decreases with treatment of pulmonary exacerbation (26Griffioen A.W. Molema G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 237-268PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that, in cystic fibrosis, no functional CFTR exits and consequently there is diminished uptake of SPP, allowing SPP to be more available to stimulate excessive angiogenesis in response to inflammation. How CFTR regulates uptake of SPP may be related to its chloride channel activity. The CFTR protein is an epithelial Cl− channel stimulated by ATP and protein kinase A. In addition CFTR also acts as a regulator of outwardly rectifying Cl− channel, calcium-activated Cl− channels, and sodium channels (27Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. Am. J. Med. 1998; 104: 576-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is not absolutely clear whether those latter functions are due to direct action of CFTR or to indirect regulation of separate channels. Therefore, it is feasible that CFTR may transport or may regulate the transport of other, as yet unrecognized, substrates in addition to Cl− ions, such as SPP. Cl− secretion is stimulated either by agents that increase cAMP, or it can be stimulated by intracellular Ca2+. The former pathway is defective in cystic fibrosis; however, the latter pathway is intact in epithelia of cystic fibrosis patients. In the mouse model of cystic fibrosis, it appears that Ca2+-mediated Cl secretion allows the animal to compensate and avoid the respiratory disease. SPP is known to cause increases in cytosolic Ca2+, and this is believed to be mediated by EDG receptor action. In the absence of CFTR, and with presumably more endogenous SPP available for EDG receptor binding, it is surprising that this mechanism of Cl− secretion does not take over. It is possible to propose exogenous SPP as a potential agent to overcome the defect in Cl secretion in CFTR, albeit this would be in conflict with its potentially deleterious effects on angiogenesis and inflammation as hypothesized above. It is conceivable that the effects of SPP on angiogenesis and on calcium mobilization could be dissociated such that the former could be blocked and the latter enhanced. Our yeast molecular genetic work led us to the discovery of YOR1 as a fumonisin resistant gene and to identify its function as a SPP transporter. YOR1 belongs to class 2 of the ABC transporter family of proteins, the same subclass of the ABC transporter family as CFTR. This is based on the spacing between two domains, Walker A and Walker B, in nucleotide binding domain 1 of these transporters (28Katzmann D.J. Epping E.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2998-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly to CFTR, YOR1 is demonstrated to localize to the S. cerevisiaeplasma membrane. It is interesting that a deletion of a phenylalanine residue in YOR1 at position 670 (ΔF670 YOR1) led to an unstable mutant protein (29Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) that appeared to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, comparable to the effects of the ΔF508 mutation in the CFTR leading to cystic fibrosis. This study underscores the potentially important role of yeast genetics in the elucidation of novel pathways that are relevant to human disease. We thank Kathy Wiita for administrative assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2086761959,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene (NAG-1) is known to be associated with anti-tumorigenic activity and belongs to the transforming growth factor-β superfamily. In the present study, we cloned the promoter region (−3500 to +41) and investigated the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the basal expression of the human NAG-1 gene. Several potential transcription factor-binding sites in this region were identified. Based on the results from clones of nested deletions, the construct between −133 and +41 base pairs contains three Sp1-binding sites (Sp1-A, Sp1-B, and Sp1-C), which confer basal transcription specific activity of NAG-1 expression. When the Sp1-C site was mutated (GG to TT), a 60–80% decrease in promoter activity was observed in HCT-116 cells. Gel shift, co-transfection, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the Sp transcription factors bind to the Sp1-binding sites and transactivate NAG-1 expression. In addition, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor 1 can interact with the C-terminal region of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins and induce NAG-1 promoter activity through Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors. These results identify the critical regulatory regions for the human NAG-1 basal promoter. Furthermore, the results suggest that the level of expression of the NAG-1 gene will depend on the availability of Sp proteins and on co-factors such as chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor 1."

Herein, we describe the first detailed kinetic characterization of p300 using full-length purified recombinant enzyme. These studies have employed peptide substrates to systematically examine the substrate specificity requirements and the kinetic mechanism of this enzyme. The importance of nearby positively charged residues in lysine targeting was demonstrated. The strict structural requirement of the lysine side chain was shown. The catalytic mechanism of p300 was shown to follow a ping-pong kinetic pathway and viscosity experiments revealed that product release and/or a conformational change were likely rate-limiting in catalysis. Detailed analysis of the p300 selective inhibitor Lys-CoA showed that it exhibited slow, tight-binding kinetics."

The association requires the N terminus of LKB1 and the helicase domain of Brg1 and LKB1 stimulates the ATPase activity of Brg1. Brg1 expression in SW13 cells induces the formation of flat cells indicative of cell cycle arrest and senescence. Expression of a kinase-dead mutant of LKB1, SL26, in SW13 cells blocks the formation of Brg1-induced flat cells, indicating that LKB1 is required for Brg1-dependent growth arrest. The inability of mutants of LKB1 to mediate Brg1-dependent growth arrest may explain the manifestations of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.

We found that LKB1 associates with Brg1, a component of SWI·SNF chromatin remodeling complexes. LKB1 stimulates the ATPase activity of Brg1 and is required for Brg1-induced growth arrest. A unidirectional HeLa cell-derived cDNA library in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was fractionated into 680 small pools containing ∼100 different clones per pool, as described (19Lustig K.D. Stukenberg P.T. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Cryns V.L. Mead P.E. Zon L.I. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Pools were transcribed and translated in vitro (coupled TNT system, Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Each translated pool was resuspended in Buffer 1 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 200 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 4 µg/ml of pepstatin, leupeptin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF)), followed by pre-clearance with 40 pmol of GST bound to glutathione-agarose beads, for 2 h while rocking at 4 °C. Labeled proteins were incubated with GST-LKB1 (10 pmol) or GST (10 pmol) for 2 h while rocking at 4 °C, washed three times in Buffer 1, followed by two washes in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized using a molecular imager. Brg1ΔHpcDNA3.1 was constructed by digesting Brg1HRpcDNA3.1 with SmaI, and the resulting fragment was ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) at EcoRV and SmaI. Brg1HpcDNA3.1 was constructed by introducing a BamHI site and an XhoI site followed by ligation into pcDNA3.1(+) at BamHI and XhoI. Brg1HpGEX4T2 and Brg1ΔHpGEX4T2 were constructed by digesting Brg1HpcDNA3.1 and Brg1ΔHpcDNA3.1 with BamHI and XhoI and ligating into pGEX4T2 at BamHI and XhoI. Brg1HRpGEX4T2 was constructed by digesting Brg1HRpcDNA3.1 withBamHI and XhoI followed by ligation into pGEX4T2 at BamHI and XhoI. LKB1pGEX4T2 and SL26pGEX4T2 were constructed by digesting LKB1 and SL26 with EcoRI andSalI from LKB1pAHC and SL26pAHC followed by ligation into pGEX4T1 at EcoRI and SalI. ΔC-LKB1pGEX4T1 was constructed by digesting LKB1pAHC with EcoRI andScaI followed by ligation into pGEX4T1 at EcoRI and SmaI. ΔN-LKB1 was constructed by digesting LKB1 withBstXI followed by Klenow dNTP addition and SalI digestion and ligation into pGEX4T2 at SmaI-SalI. LKB1pBJ5 and SL26pBJ5 were constructed by digesting LKB1pAHC and SL26pAHC with XhoI and NotI followed by ligation into pBJ5 at XhoI and NotI. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed in Buffer 2 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and AEBSF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% deoxycholate). Endogenous LKB1 was immunoprecipitated with LKB1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, New York), and transfected LKB1 was immunoprecipitated with HA antibody (12CA5). GST-LKB1 and GST-SL26 were purified from insect cells using GSH-agarose beads. The proteins were eluted from the beads with GSH, concentrated, and then diluted to remove the GSH. Kinase assays were conducted at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 75 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 µm ATP, and 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography. ATPase assays were carried out as described using Flag-Brg1 purified from insect cells (20Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The release of32PO4 from [γ-32P]ATP was determined using purified recombinant Flag-Brg1 (25 fmol) in the absence and presence of supercoiled DNA (pBluescript; 100 ng), purified recombinant GST-LKB1 (2.5 pmol), GST-SL26 (2.5 pmol), GST-ΔC-LKB1 (2.5 pmol), or GST (2.5 pmol). 2 × 106 SW13, from primary small cell lung carcinoma from an adrenal metastasis (ATCC number CCL-105), were transiently transfected with Brg1, LKB1, SL26, pBJ5 vector alone, or Brg1 + LKB1 or SL26. pcDNA3.1 containing a neomycin resistance gene was included at a ratio of 5:1 for selection in neomycin. Beginning 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with neomycin (200 µg/ml) for an additional 14 days. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, washed, and then stained with 2% crystal violet. For each condition, the number of flat cells in 40 randomly selected 40× fields were counted. To identify proteins that interact with LKB1, we adapted anin vitro expression cloning strategy (19Lustig K.D. Stukenberg P.T. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Cryns V.L. Mead P.E. Zon L.I. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in which a HeLa cell cDNA library was divided into 680 pools of ∼100 cDNAs per pool. The pools were transcribed and translated in vitroin the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with either GST or a GST fusion protein of LKB1, bound to GSH beads. The beads were washed, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with a phosphoimager. We identified a pool that contained a 35-kDa protein that bound specifically to LKB1. By progressively subdividing this pool a single clone was isolated (Fig.1A). The clone was sequenced, and the 945-base pair cDNA was found to code for amino acids 1080–1395 of Brg1, containing the helicase- and retinoblastoma (Rb)-binding domains (Brg1HR). Brg1 and Brahma are the mammalian orthologs ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae SWI1·SNF2 and have ATP-dependent helicase activity that is necessary for the chromatin remodeling function of SWI·SNF complexes (21Khavari P.A.

In addition to either Brg1 or Brahma, mammalian SWI·SNF complexes contain other components (BAF170, BAF155, BAF60, BAF53, and INI1) whose functions are not well understood (25Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y.

To determine whether LKB1 and Brg1 interact in vivo, LKB1 was immunoprecipitated from Saos-2 cells, and the immunoprecipitates were Western blotted for Brg1. Brg1 was present in the LKB1 immunoprecipitates, indicating that the endogenous proteins associate (Fig. 1 B). To identify the region necessary for binding LKB1 we made truncations of Brg1HR (containing amino acids 1080–1395 of Brg1) that expressed just the helicase domain (Brg1H; amino acids 1103–1231) or the region lacking the helicase domain (Brg1ΔH; amino acids 1231–1395). The Brg1 truncations were transcribed and translatedin vitro with [35S]methionine, followed by incubation with GST-LKB1 or GST alone. LKB1 bound to the helicase domain of Brg1 but did not bind to the protein lacking the helicase domain (Fig. 2A). N-terminal (ΔN-LKB1, containing amino acids 240–430) and C-terminal (ΔC-LKB1, containing amino acids 1–146 of LKB1) truncations of LKB1 were used to identify the region of LKB1 necessary to bind to Brg1. The constructs were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins, and binding to [35S]methionine-labeled Brg1HR was determined. ΔC-LKB1 bound to Brg1, but ΔN-LKB1 did not, indicating that the N terminus of LKB1 is both necessary and sufficient to mediate binding to the helicase domain of Brg1 (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether LKB1 mutants found in PJS bind to Brg1, we transfected Saos-2 cells with HA-tagged wild type LKB1 or the SL26 mutant, and HA immunoprecipitates were Western blotted for Brg1. The SL26 mutant associated with Brg1, as well as wild type LKB1, indicating that the lack of association of LKB1 with Brg1 is not responsible for PJS (Fig. 3A). We also determined whether the kinase activity of LKB1 is necessary for association with Brg1. The SL26 mutant has been reported to lack kinase activity; however this finding is controversial (15Nezu J. Oku A. Shimane M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Ylikorkala A. Avizienyte E. Tomlinson I.P. Tiainen M. Roth S. Loukola A. Hemminki A. Johansson M. Sistonen P. Markie D.

Makela T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9248-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), so we assayed the activity of the SL26 mutant. We did not detect autophosphorylation in either immunoprecipitates from transiently transfected cells (data not shown) or from recombinant GST-SL26 produced in insect cells (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, K252a, a kinase inhibitor that blocks autophosphorylation of LKB1, had no effect on the association of [35S]Brg1HR made in reticulocyte lysate with LKB1 produced in insect cells (data not shown). Thus, the kinase activity of LKB1 is not necessary for association with Brg1. Because the activity of Brg1 is regulated by phosphorylation (23Muchardt C. Reyes J.C. Bourachot B. Leguoy E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3394-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 40Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) we used Brg1 complexes purified from mammalian cells or recombinant Brg1 expressed in insect cells as substrates for LKB1. We detected no increase in phosphorylation above background, with the exception of LKB1 autophosphorylation, in samples to which LKB1 was added (data not shown). These results indicate that the kinase activity of LKB1 is not likely to regulate Brg1-containing SWI·SNF complexes directly. Because LKB1 did not phosphorylate Brg1, we investigated whether its association with LKB1 might regulate Brg1 by measuring the effect of LKB1 and SL26 on the ATPase activity of recombinant Brg1. DNA alone stimulated Brg1 ATPase activity 3-fold, as expected (Fig.4A). In the absence of DNA, LKB1 or SL26 also stimulated Brg1 ATPase activity 3-fold. In the presence of both DNA and LKB1 or SL26, Brg1 ATPase activity was stimulated 6-fold, compared with Brg1 alone (Fig. 4 A). LKB1, SL26, or GST alone did not hydrolyze ATP in the absence of Brg1 (data not shown). These results indicate that LKB1 binding stimulates Brg1 function. We also tested whether the GST fusion protein containing only the N terminus of LKB1 activated the ATPase activity of Brg1 (Fig.4 B). Even though this protein binds to Brg1, it did not enhance Brg1-ATPase activity, indicating that the C terminus of LKB1 is required to stimulate the ATPase activity of Brg1. Both LKB1 and the SL26 mutant stimulated the ATPase activity of Brg1, raising the question of whether loss of this function could account for PJS. It is not known whether mutant LKB1 proteins are expressed in patients with PJS; if the mutant proteins are not stable, lack of binding to Brg1 could explain the manifestations of PJS. However, the SL26 mutant is stable when ectopically expressed and therefore may be present in the cells of patients with PJS. Furthermore, several mutations in LKB1 found in patients with PJS are point mutants that would be expected to eliminate the kinase activity but not disrupt the structure (16Ylikorkala A. Avizienyte E. Tomlinson I.P. Tiainen M. Roth S. Loukola A. Hemminki A. Johansson M. Sistonen P. Markie D. Neale K. Phillips R. Zauber P. Twama T. Sampson J. Jarvinen H. Makela T.P. Aaltonen L.A. Hum.

To test this idea we used the kinase-dead SL26 mutant as a dominant negative to determine whether it would block Brg1-dependent growth arrest in SW13 cells, which do not express Brg1. Expression of Brg1 in SW13 cells leads to the formation of large flat cells that have undergone Rb-dependent growth arrest (33Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J.

We determined by Western blotting that SW13 cells express LKB1 (data not shown), thus the SL26 mutant could act as a dominant negative to block endogenous LKB1 function in these cells. SW13 cells were transiently transfected with Brg1, LKB1, SL26, or vector alone or co-transfected with Brg1 and LKB1 or SL26. The cells were selected for 14 days in neomycin, and the number of flat cells per 40 randomly selected 40× fields were counted. Brg1 induced the formation of flat cells, as expected. Co-expression of LKB1 and Brg1 did not affect the number of Brg1-induced flat cells (Table I). However, co-expression of SL26 and Brg1 reduced the number of flat cells ∼3-fold compared with Brg1 alone (p < 0.001). Because SL26 lacks protein kinase activity, but binds to Brg1 and stimulates its ATPase activity, these results indicate that the protein kinase activity of LKB1 is likely required for Brg1-induced growth arrest. Co-expression of Brg1 and SL26 did not affect Brg1 expression in transient transfection assays (data not shown). The expression of either LKB1 or SL26 alone induced a 2-fold increase in flat cell formation compared with expression of vector alone (TableI).Table IEffect of LKB1 on Brg1-dependent flat cell formationPlasmids transfectedNumber of flat cells/experimentMean flat cells1-aMean of seven experiments ± S.E.p Values1234567%Brg1194 (100)61 (100)193 (100)48 (100)53 (100)61 (100)84 (100)100Brg1 + LKB1104 (54)63 (103)81 (42)28 (58)49 (92)81 (132)57 (68)78 ± 12NSBrg1 + SL2661 (31)26 (43)58 (30)16 (33)15 (28)49 (80)21 (25)38 ± 7<0.0011-bp value compared to Brg1 alone.LKB141 (21)18 (29)85 (44)9 (18)9 (17)15 (24)10 (12)24 ± 4<0.00011-bp value compared to Brg1 alone.<0.051-cp value compared to pBJ5 alone.SL2638 (19)17 (28)48 (24)9 (18)5 (9)20 (32)19 (22)22 ± 3<0.00011-bp value compared to Brg1 alone.<0.051-cp value compared to pBJ5 alone.pBJ511 (6)7 (14)10 (12)11 ± 2<0.0011-bp value compared to Brg1 alone.For each condition, the number of flat cells in 40 randomly selected 40× fields were counted, and values represent the number of flat cells identified in each of seven experiments.

LKB1 appears to have both kinase-dependent and -independent functions involving Brg1. Both wild type LKB1 and the SL26 mutant stimulate the ATPase activity of Brg1, but the kinase activity of LKB1 is required for Brg1-dependent growth arrest. Both of these activities of LKB1 may be important in normal cellular function. Expression of RNA coding for a splice variant of LKB1 that lacks a portion of the kinase domain has been identified in several tissues (43Churchman M. Dowling B. Tomlinson I.P. DNA Seq. 1999; 10: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This splice variant, if expressed as a protein, could serve as an endogenous inhibitor of LKB1 function, whose expression, like SL26, would allow cell cycle progression. Our results place LKB1 in a pathway in which Brg1 functions to regulate cell cycle progression. Brg1 heterozygous mice develop epithelial tumors (44Bultman S. Gebuhr T. Yee D. La Mantia C.

Specific fragmentations identified in matrix-assisted laser desorption-post source decay spectra and low energy collisional-induced dissociation tandem mass spectroscopy spectra of sulfinamide-containing digest peptides confirmed Lys34/35 to Cys41sulfinamide bonds. HOCl oxidation of mutants lacking Cys41(Ala41S100A8) or specific Lys residues (e.g.Lys34/35, Ala34/35S100A8) did not form sulfinamide cross-links.

S100 proteins form non-covalent homodimers characterized by a symmetric homodimeric fold not found in other Ca2+-binding proteins in solution.

The respiratory burst produces superoxide anion (up to 40 μmol/106 cells) corresponding to a maximal blood concentration of ∼200 μm, which dismutates to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and is converted by myeloperoxidase (MPO) to the powerful two-electron (non-radical) oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) that can modify proteins and lipids and kill invading pathogens (25Dean R.

Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). A8/S100A9 (A9), present constitutively in high concentrations (∼40% of cytosolic protein) in PMN, can be released from activated or dying cells at inflammatory sites (1Hessian P.A. Edgeworth J. Hogg N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 32Kerkhoff C. Klempt M. Sorg C. Biochim. Biophys.

A8 is effectively oxidized in vitro by low amounts of reagent HOCl (molar ratios of <∼10), with 70–80% conversion to dimer, and PMA activation of neutrophils generated an oxidative burst that efficiently oxidized exogenous A8 within 10 min, most likely via H2O2/MPO released by activated cells.

Moreover, disulfide-linked A8 homo-, but not A8/A9 heterodimer, is found in lung lavage fluid of mice at the beginning of the resolution phase of LPS-induced pulmonary injury (10Harrison C.A.

Oxidation of the single Cys41 residue in A8 by Cu2+ to the disulfide-linked homodimer was highly specific and negated bioactivity in vitro and in vivo(10Harrison C.A. Raftery M.J. Walsh J. Alewood P.

Positive chemotactic activity of a Cys41→Ala41 mutant (Ala41A8) confirmed that Cys41 is not essential for function and implied that covalent dimerization may structurally modify accessibility of the chemotactic hinge domain. Therefore, oxidation-dependent dimerization may also be a physiologically significant regulatory mechanism controlling A8-provoked leukocyte recruitment (10Harrison C.A. Raftery M.J. Walsh J.

Moreover, the exquisite susceptibility of A8 to oxidation and the potentially large amounts present may protect against excessive tissue damage at sites of acute inflammation. Here we describe the oxidation products of reagent HOCl-oxidized A8 using peptide mapping and mass spectrometry. Novel intra-and intermolecular sulfinamide bonds between Cys41 and Lys residues were readily generated as well as conversion of Met to Met sulfoxide (Met(O)). Sulfinamide formation apparently occurs via sulfenic acid and/or sulfinyl chloride intermediates, which may decompose upon reaction with amines, yielding stable covalent bonds. Identical products were formed by HOCl generated enzymatically via the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system and from PMA-activated human neutrophils. The oxidized A8 monomer retained activity in chemotaxis assays in vitro. Reagents and chemicals were analytical grade (Sigma, Bio-Rad), and solvents were HPLC grade (Mallinckrodt Chemical Works). Reagent hypochlorous acid (10–13%) was from Aldrich. Recombinant A8/Ala41A8 was produced using the pGEX expression system as detailed (10Harrison C.A. Raftery M.J. Walsh J. Alewood P. Iismaa S.E.

Liquid chromatographic separations were performed using a non-metallic LC626 HPLC system (Waters, Bedford, MA) and monitored atA214 nm and A280 nmwith a Waters 996 photodiode array detector or 490 UV-visible detector. A8 (∼100 μg, 10 nmol) was diluted with PBS (100 μl, 25 mm phosphate, 250 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), HOCl (5 μl, 50 nmol), and the solution was left at 22 °C for 10 min. Products were separated using C4 RP HPLC (5 μm, 300 Å, 4.6 × 250 mm, Vydac, Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) with a gradient of 25–70% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min. Major fractions atA214 nm were collected and lyophilized before analysis. Human MPO (40 milliunits, Sigma) added to A8 (∼25 μg, 2.5 nmol) and H2O2 (10 nmol) in PBS (50 μl) were incubated for 5–15 min at 22 °C. Oxidation products were separated using C4 RP-HPLC (as above). The masses of oxidized A8 were determined using electrospay ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) after lyophilization and resuspension of samples in H2O/CH3CN/acetic acid (50 μl). Neutrophils were isolated by standard procedures (10Harrison C.A. Raftery M.J. Walsh J. Alewood P. Iismaa S.E. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. J. Biol.

Aliquots (500 μl) removed 10 and 30 min after activation were centrifuged (10,000 g, 30 s), and supernatants were frozen immediately at −80 °C. After thawing, oxidation products were separated using C4 RP HPLC (as above), and masses of oxidation products were determined using ESI-MS (as above). In some experiments sodium azide (50 μm) was included to inhibit HOCl formation by MPO. A8 (∼25 μg, 3 nmol) was diluted with PBS (25 μl), HOCl (1.5 μl, 50 nmol), and the solution was left at 22 °C for 20 s. Dimedone (2 μl, 10−6m, Aldrich) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 22 °C for 10 min. Products were separated using C4 RP HPLC with a gradient of 35–55% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min. MajorA214 nm were collected and lyophilized before analysis by ESI-MS (as above). A8/Ala41A8 (100 μg) isolated from C4 RP-HPLC were digested in ammonium bicarbonate (400 μl, 50 mm, pH 8.0) using endoprotease Asp-N (sequencing grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of ∼1:100 at 37 °C for 3 h. The pH of the digest was adjusted to ∼2 (1% trifluoroacetic acid), and the mixture was applied directly to a C18 RP column (5 μm, 300 Å, 4.6 × 250 mm, Vydac, Separations Group). Peptides were eluted with a gradient of 5–75% acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at 1 ml/min over 30 min. Fractions with major absorbances at A214 nm were collected then lyophilized and redissolved in H2O/CH3CN/acetic acid (50:49:1) for ESI or MALDI-MS or further enzymatic digestion. Unoxidized or oxidized A832–57 (∼40 μg) isolated after Asp-N treatment were digested with pepsin (100 ng, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in sodium formate (250 μl, 100 mm, pH 4.0) at 22 °C for 4 h or endoprotease Lys-C or Glu-C (sequencing grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in ammonium bicarbonate (50 μl, 50 mm, pH 8.0) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of ∼1:100 at 37 °C for 5 h. Peptides were isolated as described above before ESI-MALDI-MS analysis. The coding region of A8 was subcloned from a previously described construct (GST-CP10) (34Iismaa S.E. Hu S.P. Kocher M. Lackmann M. Harrison C.A. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) into the BamHI site of pBluescript (SK) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The A8 insert was subcloned from pBluescript (SK) into theNotI/EcoRV sites of pOCUS-2 vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The point mutations (Lys34 and Lys35 to Ala34/35) were made using a modified version of the whole plasmid polymerase chain reaction technique described by Fisher and Pei (36Fisher C.L. Pei G.K. Biotechniques. 1997; 23: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), omitting the DpnI digestion step. Sequences of the reverse and forward primers used to generate the double point mutations were GAA GTC ATT CTT GTA GAG GGC ATG GTG ATT and GCG GCA ATG GTC ACT ACT GAG TGT CCT CAG. Both primers were phosphorylated using the T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) before polymerase chain reaction. After polymerase chain reaction and gel purification, the linearized plasmid was recircularized using T4 ligase (Promega, Madison, WI), then transformed in Escherichia coli. Plasmid DNA derived from individual colonies was bidirectionally sequenced to confirm that correct base substitutions had been made. The mutated A8-coding sequence was subcloned from pOCUS-2 vector into the BamHI site of pGEX-2T vector (Amrad-Pharmacia, Melbourne, Australia) and transformed intoE. coli, and recombinant mutant protein was purified after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (34Iismaa S.E. Hu S.P. Kocher M. Lackmann M. Harrison C.A. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Masses of proteins and peptides were determined using ESI. Spectra were acquired using a single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source (MSD1100, Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Samples (∼50 pmol, 10 μl) were injected into water:acetonitrile (50:50), 1% acetic acid (10 μl/min) using an LC1100 pump (Hewlett Packard) coupled directly to the electrospray source. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizer and drying gas (7.0 liter/min, 150 °C). Sample droplets were ionized at a positive potential of ∼4000 V and transferred to the mass analyzer with a fragmentor voltage (capillary to skimmer lens voltage) of 75 V. Spectra were acquired over the mass range m/z 200–1500 in 0.5 s with unit resolution. Low energy collisional-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS spectra were recorded using a triple quadrupole (TSQ 7000, Finnigan, San Jose, CA) where multiply charged (+2, +3, or +4) precursor ions were selected with Q1, collisionally activated within rf-only Q2 (20–100 eV, argon 1.5 milliotorr), and spectra were recorded with unit resolution using Q3 (m/z 50–2550, 2 s) and accumulated into a single file for 4–5 min. Ions were formed using an “in-house” nano-ESI device consisting of a bora-silicate glass capillary (50 × 2.5 mm, exit inner diameter <50 μm) containing peptide solutions (∼10 μl, H2O/CH3CN/CH3CO2H, 50:49:1). Electrical contact (∼1.5–2 kV) was maintained using a platinum electrode protruding into the liquid. The glass capillary was positioned 2–5 mm from the entrance to the heated capillary, which was at 150 °C; stable ion currents were maintained with flow rates of <200 nl/min. Protein or peptide solutions (∼25 pg/μl) were mixed with matrix (1 μl of sinapinic acid or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Sigma) 10 mg/ml) and air-dried before analysis using a Voyager STR TOF mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Spectra were acquired in linear mode, and positive ions were generated using an N2 laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse-width, 20-Hz repetition rate) and accelerated to 25 kV after an extraction delay of 100–250 μs. Typically, 25–50 spectra were averaged and calibrated externally using angiotensin I and insulin (oxidized) B chain (peptides) or insulin (oxidized) B chain and myoglobin (proteins). Post source decay spectra (PSD) were also acquired using a Voyager STR mass spectrometer with the timed ion selector set to the precursor mass, a mirror ratio of 1.12; 11 segments with a 75% decrement ratio were acquired and “stitched” automatically using the instrument software (Data Explorer V5, Perseptive Biosystems). A different target position was chosen for each segment, and 100–200 spectra were acquired and averaged. Spectra were calibrated using the metastable fragments of substance P or angiotensin-I (Sigma) and were generally <∼1.5 Da of their predicted value. MALDI peptide mass fingerprinting of lyophilized proteins (∼100 ng) were determined after resuspension in H2O/CH3CN (85:15, 12.5 μl, 10 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8) with endoprotease Asp-N (∼2 ng). After digestion for 14 h at 37 °C, digests (1 μl) were analyzed directly after the addition of matrix (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 1 μl, 10 mg/ml) by MADLI over a mass range of m/z 500–7,000. Approximately 100 spectra were acquired in reflectron mode (Voyager) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and an extraction delay of 250 ns, and spectra were calibrated either externally using angiotensin I and insulin (oxidized) B chain or internally using protonated A8−2–14(monoisotopic mass, m/z 1457.7851). A8 analogues (10 μg) lyophilized (Speedvac, Savant, Farmingdale, NY) with glycerol (1 μl) were stored at −80 °C. Reconstitution to a 10−6m stock solution was with PBS (10 μl) and RPMI 1640 (990 μl) and serial dilutions were made in RPMI, bovine serum albumin (0.2%) immediately before use. Thioglycollate-elicited murine neutrophils were used as responding cells (15Lackmann M. Rajasekariah P. Iismaa S.E. Cornish C.J. Simpson R.J. Reid G. Moritz R.L. Geczy C.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2981-2991PubMed Google Scholar) and were suspended in HEPES-buffered saline solution, bovine serum albumin (0.2%) at 5 × 106/ml then incubated with calcein AM (5 μm, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air, washed twice with HEPES-buffered saline solution, and resuspended at 0.5 × 106/ml in RPMI, bovine serum albumin (0.2%). Assays were performed using MBA 96-well chambers fitted with 5-μm polycarbonate membranes (Neuro Probe Inc., Bethesda, MD). Proteins (10−13–10−8m) diluted in RPMI/bovine serum albumin (0.2%, 410 μl) were placed in the lower compartment, and cells (300 μl) were placed in the upper compartment. To determine the effects of random migration, equivalent concentrations of protein were included in the upper chamber. The chamber was incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2in air for 90 min. Cells collected in the lower chamber were measured by fluorescence (λex = 485 nm, λem = 530 nm) using a multi-well plate reader (Cytofluor, Perseptive Biosystems), and numbers were extrapolated using a standard curve obtained using the fluorescence readings of a known number of labeled cells. Complement C5a (10−9m) was used as positive control in all experiments. Data from at least three experiments were analyzed using Student's t test. Hypochlorite (OCl−) is the major oxidant produced by neutrophils in inflammatory responses, and murine A8 is highly susceptible to oxidation by reagent HOCl (10Harrison C.A. Raftery M.J. Walsh J.

Low concentrations of hypochlorite (<40 μm) convert A8 to a modified monomer (10,354, +46 Da), corresponding to the addition of 3 oxygens and loss of dihydrogen and to oxidized dimer (20,707, +93 Da), indicating oxidation of susceptible amino acids (Cys/Met) (10Harrison C.A.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation with silver staining showed that when A8 was treated with as little as 10 μm HOCl, ∼20% was converted to dimer and yields increased to 70–80% with 40 μm HOCl, whereas levels >100 μm caused loss of detectable protein, possibly due to aggregation. The resistance of Ala41A8 to HOCl-mediated dimerization at all HOCl concentrations confirmed the role of Cys41. Reagent or MPO-generated HOCl (28Hazell L.J. van der Berg J.J.M. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) form identical reaction products in proteins with reactive aldehydes from α-amino acids (37Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. d'Avignon A. Heinecke J.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6864-6873Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and Cys and Met, followed by amines (e.g. Lys, forming chloramines), are substrates (30Winterbourn C.C.

Thus, products generated by reagent HOClin vitro are likely to reflect those produced by HOCl generated by activated phagocytes. Murine A8 treated with ∼4–5 equivalents of reagent HOCl for 10 min at 20 °C yielded 4 major products after C4 RP-HPLC (Fig.1 A; compare with the single peak of unmodified A8, Fig. 7 A). The major product (Fig.1 A, peak 3) had a m/z of 10,354 ± 1, 46 greater than the unmodified protein. Three additional components of m/z 10,354, 10,388, and 20,707 (Fig. 1 A, peaks 1, 2, and4) were also isolated.Figure 7Comparison of C4 RP-HPLC chromatograms after incubation of S100A8 with various oxidants.

Similar chromatograms were obtained after the oxidation with reagent HOCl (molar ratio protein:oxidant ∼1:5) (B) or myeloperoxidase/H2O2/Cl− (molar ratio protein:H2O2 ∼1:5) (C) for 10 min. The reaction of H2O2 without MPO (D) (molar ratio protein:H2O2 ∼1:5) converted a small amount of monomer to disulfide-linked dimer in 10 min. PMA-activated human PMN also converted exogenous A8 into oxidized forms, although the chromatogram was complicated by secreted PMN proteins.View Large Image"

In this study we have analyzed the VEGF-elicited pathways involved in the induction of tissue factor in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells. Using specific low molecular weight inhibitors we could demonstrate a crucial role of the p38 and Erk-1/2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. In contrast, treatment with wortmannin or LY294002, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase, resulted in a strong enhancement of the VEGF-induced tissue factor production, indicating a negative regulatory role of the PI3-kinase on tissue factor-inducing pathways. Accordingly, transduction with constitutively active Akt led to a reduction of VEGF-induced tissue factor production. Western blot analyses using antibodies specific for phosphorylated p38 showed an enhanced activation of this MAP kinase in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells when stimulated with VEGF in the presence of wortmannin in comparison to either agent alone. Thus, the negative regulation of the PI3-kinase pathway on endothelial tissue factor activity can be explained at least in part by a suppression of this MAP kinase-signaling pathway. This is the first demonstration of a reciprocal relationship between procoagulant activity and the PI3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway, and it reveals a novel mechanism by which tissue factor expression can be controlled in endothelial cells.

Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4792) Google Scholar). It is distinct from other endothelial growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor and the fibroblast growth factors by its ability to selectively stimulate endothelial cell growth and, in addition, to initiate endothelial procoagulant activity and vascular permeability (2Clauss M. Gerlach M. Gerlach H. Brett J. Wang F. Familletti P.C. Pan Y.-C. Olander J.V. Connolly D.T. Stern D. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 3Senger D. Galli S.

These permeability and procoagulant activities have been suggested to contribute to the sensitization of the tumor vasculature to undergo tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-mediated hemorrhagic necrosis in experimental models (4Shimomura K.

However, tumor endothelium, either without treatment or strongly enhanced after systemic TNF infusion, is the only example of endothelial tissue factor and procoagulant activity expression in vivo (7Contrino J.

What bans tissue factor from the endothelium under physiological conditions and what enables tissue factor expression in certain tumors are not understood.In contrast to the in vivo situation, in vitrotissue factor expression on the surface of endothelial cells can be induced by TNF, interleukin-1, and VEGF (10Nawroth P.P.

Recently, endothelial tissue factor induction by VEGF was found to be independent of NFκB but because of the induction or activation of the transcription factors Egr-1 and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (15Armesilla A.L.

Binder B.R. Hofer E. Blood. 1999; 93: 3811-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Two VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) are present on vascular endothelial cells, and VEGF signaling is mediated by receptor dimerization, leading to autophosphorylation of the cytosolic domains of these receptors. Phosphorylated VEGF receptors serve as docking sites for adapter molecules or for signaling enzymes such as PI3-kinase. VEGF has been shown to activate PI3-kinase generating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphates, which create docking sites for the protein kinase B better known as Akt (17Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A.

Akt as the major downstream signal of PI3-kinase has been shown to induce various endothelial functions including survival, migration, and nitrogen monoxide (NO) production and was demonstrated as a potent proangiogenic signaling molecule (19Dimmeler S.

In addition to PI3-kinase activation, VEGFR-2 autophosphorylation has been demonstrated to recruit and activate phospholipase Cγ. Phospholipase Cγ cleaves membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate resulting in soluble inositoltrisphosphate, which causes the release of Ca2+from intracellular storage pools, and diacyglycerol formation, which is the main activator of protein kinases C (PKC). PKC activation is upstream of the Raf/MEK/Erk-signaling cascade and is involved in VEGF effects such as proliferation and vascular permeability (23Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J.

Based on the findings that nuclear factor of activated T-cells and Egr-1 but not NFκB are essential transcription factors for VEGF-induced tissue factor production, evidence for an involvement of Ca2+ and MAP kinase-dependent pathways has been provided (15Armesilla A.L.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we show here that inhibition of PI3-kinase activity by wortmannin and LY294002 synergistically enhanced VEGF-induced tissue factor activity. This effect of PI3-kinase inhibitors on VEGF-induced endothelial tissue factor seemed to involve MAP kinases, because the inhibition of PI3-kinase signaling correlated with an enhanced phosphorylation of the p38 MAP kinase and to a certain degree of the Erk-1/2 MAP kinase, two essential mediators of VEGF-induced endothelial tissue factor activity.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that VEGF can induce signal transduction pathways that regulate endothelial tissue factor production in a positive as well as a negative fashion. Positive regulation was shown to essentially depend on the two MAP kinases p38 and Erk-1/2 by the use of small chemical inhibitors. Negative regulation of tissue factor production occurred via the activation of the PI3-kinase-Akt-signaling pathway as demonstrated with two selective inhibitors of the PI3-kinase and transfection of a constitutively activated mutant of Akt. Although the use of chemical inhibitors is limited by the specificity of the inhibitors, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that the observed negative regulatory effect is indeed caused by the VEGF-induced PI3-kinase activity. First, the wortmannin concentration used (100 nm) is in the range described to be specific for the PI3-kinase (half-maximal at 5 nm), and a dose-response curve for tissue factor induction displayed a very similar response as measured with the PI3-kinase (data not shown). Furthermore, we could confirm our results with a second specific PI3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Finally, the use of a constitutively active Akt mutant strongly reduced VEGF-induced procoagulant activity, linking this kinase, which is directly downstream of PI3-kinase, to the negative regulation of tissue factor induction.To explain the negative regulation of tissue factor production by the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway several alternative explanations are possible. For example, in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages inhibition of the PI3-kinase was demonstrated to lead to prolonged NFκB activation (36Diaz-Guerra M.J. Castrillo A. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6184-6190PubMed Google Scholar). Although VEGF has also been reported to induce NFκB activation in endothelial cells (37Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Busse R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), this induction is controversial and condition-dependent. For example, VEGF-induced NFκB activation was shown in bovine retina endothelial cells using gel shift assays (37Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Busse R.

Holzmuller H. Binder B.R. Hofer E. Blood. 1999; 93: 3811-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, VEGF-induced tissue factor induction was demonstrated to be mediated largely by the transcription factor Egr-1. (12Bierhaus A. Zhang Y. Deng Y. Mackman N. Quehenberger P. Haase M. Luther T. Müller M. Böhrer H. Greten J. Martin E. Baeuerle P.A. Waldherr R. Kisiel W. Zeigler R. Stern D.M. Nawroth P.P. J. Biol.

Blood. 1999; 93: 3811-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we failed to demonstrate any effect of VEGF treatment by the use of an NFκB reporter construct in HUVECs, and in addition, no regulatory role of PI3-kinase on NFκB activation was observed (data not shown). These data are in accordance to the recent observation that the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway has no influence on NFκB activation in endothelial cells (38Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed negative regulatory role of the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway on tissue factor production is very unlikely to occur via NFκB modulation.Another possible negative regulatory role of the PI3-kinase may be mediated by affecting endothelial NO-synthetase expression, because PI3-kinase inhibitors were described to enhance shear stress-induced transcription of this enzyme (39Malek A.M. Jiang L. Lee I. Sessa W.C. Izumo S. Alper S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). NO formation was shown previously to be downstream of phospholipase Cγ and PKC but upstream of the Erk-1/2 MAP kinase (24Wu H.M. Yuan Y. Zawieja D.C. Tinsley J. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H535-H542PubMed Google Scholar, 40Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), which is in line with our findings that PKC and MAP kinases are major signaling pathways for VEGF-induced tissue factor production (Fig. 1). However, our findings also show that VEGF-induced tissue factor production is independent on the generation of NO (Fig. 1 B). In conclusion, our observations are in favor of the hypothesis that activation of Raf by PKC occurs in HUVECs by a pathway that does not involve NO formation.Alternatively, the strong enhancement of tissue factor production by chemical inhibition of the PI3-kinase-Akt-signaling pathway can be explained by an inhibitory role of this pathway on p38 and/or Erk-1/2 activation, two kinases shown in this study to be essential for VEGF-induced tissue factor production (Fig. 1 B). According to this hypothesis VEGF elicits an anticoagulant pathway by PI3-kinase-mediated suppression of the p38 and/or Erk-1/2 MAP kinases and in parallel procoagulant pathways by p38 and Erk-1/2 MAP kinase activation. In fact, in this study we could demonstrate that the PI3-kinase-signaling pathway inhibits p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation. This is in confirmation of a very recent report showing that the blockade of PI3-kinase-Akt also led to enhanced VEGF activation of p38 and apoptosis (41Gratton, J. P., Morales-Ruiz, M., Kureishi, Y., Fulton, D., Walsh, K., and Sessa, W. C. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., 276, in pressGoogle Scholar). In addition, negative regulatory roles of the PI3-kinase-Akt-signaling pathway on the activation of Erk-1/2 were demonstrated in various different cellular systems including differentiated myotubes, a human breast cancer cell line, and also in HUVECs (38Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 42Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nunez L. Rossman R. Reid K. Moelling K.

Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). In contrast, a positive regulatory role of the PI3-kinase-mediated Erk-1/2 activation has been proposed in HUVECs because inhibition of the PI3-kinase led to a decrease in VEGF-induced Erk-1/2 phosphorylation (44Thakker G.D. Hajjar D.P. Muller W.A. Rosengart T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10002-10007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This controversy observed for the same type of primary cells (HUVECs) is also reflected by our data. Seven experiments supported the hypothesis that PI3-kinase activation in HUVECs is inhibitory, whereas three experiments suggested a rather stimulatory role for the PI3-kinase on Erk-1/2 activation in response to VEGF. Obviously the PI3-kinase effect on this pathway is condition-dependent, which can be explained by genetic and individual (historical) differences of the donor cords from which the umbilical cord vein endothelial cells were isolated. In conclusion, the inhibitory effect of the PI3-kinase pathways on VEGF-induced tissue factor production can be explained at least in part by an inhibitory effect on the p38 MAP kinase.There are numerous reports suggesting that VEGFR-2 is the major if not exclusive signaling VEGF receptor for endothelial cell functions including angiogenesis. This hypothesis has been derived also from studies using receptor-specific homologues such as the PlGF that binds to VEGFR-1 but not to VEGFR-2 (45Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer H. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), VEGF-E, which binds selectively to VEGFR-2 but not to VEGFR-1 (46Meyer M. Clauss M. Lepple-Wienhues A. Waltenberger J. Augustin H.G. Ziche M. Lanz C. Buttner M. Rziha H.J. Dehio C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), or receptor-specific mutants (34Gille H. Kowalski J. Li B. LeCouter J. Moffat B. Zioncheck T.F. Pelletier N. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3222-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In terms of tissue factor induction in endothelial cells, VEGF-E was found to have a similar bioactivity as VEGF (also designated as VEGF-A) itself (46Meyer M. Clauss M. Lepple-Wienhues A. Waltenberger J. Augustin H.G. Ziche M. Lanz C. Buttner M. Rziha H.J. Dehio C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In contrast, tissue factor was only slightly induced by PlGF (maximally at 2–3-fold) in comparison with similar concentrations of VEGF (maximally 25–80-fold) (27Clauss M. Weich H. Breier G. Knies U. Rockl W. Waltenberger J. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17629-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). On top of these findings is our present observation that VEGFR-2 signaling is essential for the observed synergy between VEGF and PI3-kinase inhibitors in tissue factor induction. This is in line with the observation that VEGFR-2-mediated signaling is the major inducer of the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway (34Gille H. Kowalski J. Li B. LeCouter J. Moffat B. Zioncheck T.F. Pelletier N. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3222-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), a finding that can be also explained by the presence of a repressor sequence in the juxtamembrane domain of the VEGFR-1, which inhibits VEGF-dependent PI3-kinase activation (47Gille H. Kowalski J., Yu, L. Chen H. Pisabarro M.T. Davis-Smyth T. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4064-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the same study only a marginal activation of P38 and Erk-1/2 was observed with VEGFR-1-specific VEGF mutants. In conclusion, a VEGFR-2-dependent PI3-kinase and Akt-activation pathway, which can suppress MAP kinase activities and subsequently also tissue factor production, fits best with the data provided in this study.In conclusion, our finding that a PI3-kinase-dependent pathway is a negative regulator for the MAP kinase-mediated tissue factor production defines a novel regulatory principle in endothelial cells. We propose that in vascular endothelial cells under physiological conditions, continuous PI3-kinase activation by plasma components such as insulin and insulin-like growth factors occurs, leading to the suppression of tissue factor production. In tumors, however, blood flow and perfusion are impaired, and the supply with growth factors is suboptimal (48Sevick E.M. Jain R.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3513-3519PubMed Google Scholar, 49Dewhirst M.W. Kimura H. Rehmus S.W. Braun R.D. Papahadjopoulos D. Hong K. Secomb T.W. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 27 (suppl.): 247-251Google Scholar). In consequence, levels of PI3-kinase activation may be reduced in tumors. In addition, tumor-produced cytokines such as VEGF can elicit specific signaling events that are not induced by serum components, leading to tissue factor production. Thus, the striking observation that tumor endothelium is one rare exception of tissue factor expression on the endothelium may be explained by diminished PI3-kinase activity together with increased P38 and Erk-1/2 MAP kinase activity in comparison to the physiological condition.Our hypothesis that PI3-kinase activity is a suppressor for endothelial activation and tissue factor production is supported by preliminary experiments, in which wortmannin was applied to animals bearing tumors producing high amounts of VEGF. In these animals hemorrhagic necroses occurred that were restricted to the tumors 2S. Kröger, S. Blum, R. de Waal, A. Hilbig, C. Ebenebe, and M. Clauss, manuscript in preparation. and similar to that observed with systemic TNF application or targeting of tissue factor to the tumor endothelium (50Huang X. Molema K. King S. Watkins L. Edgington T.S. Thorpe P.E. Science. 1997; 275: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). This is in line with a recent in vitro observation that wortmannin can also enhance the production of endothelial tissue factor protein when co-applied together with TNF and VEGF (51Shen B.Q. Lee D.Y. Cortopassi K.M. Damico L.A. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5281-5286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations give novel insights in the regulatory mechanism controlling endothelial activation and tissue factor production under physiological and pathological conditions. Further studies that address PI3-kinase induction in activatedversus quiescent endothelial cells are currently under investigation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 is the major inducer of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis (for review see Ref. 1Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4792) Google Scholar). It is distinct from other endothelial growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor and the fibroblast growth factors by its ability to selectively stimulate endothelial cell growth and, in addition, to initiate endothelial procoagulant activity and vascular permeability (2Clauss M. Gerlach M. Gerlach H. Brett J. Wang F. Familletti P.C. Pan Y.-C. Olander J.V. Connolly D.T. Stern D. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 3Senger D. Galli S. Dvorak A. Peruzzi C. Harvey V. Dvorak H.F. Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). These permeability and procoagulant activities have been suggested to contribute to the sensitization of the tumor vasculature to undergo tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-mediated hemorrhagic necrosis in experimental models (4Shimomura K. Manda S. Mukomoto K. Kobayashi S. Nakano K. Mori J. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Nawroth P.P. Handley D. Matsueda G. de Waal R. Gerlach H. Blohm D.

Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 49-63Google Scholar). However, tumor endothelium, either without treatment or strongly enhanced after systemic TNF infusion, is the only example of endothelial tissue factor and procoagulant activity expression in vivo (7Contrino J. Hair G. Kreutzer D.L. Rickles F.R. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y. Deng Y. Wendt T. Liliensiek B. Bierhaus A. Greten J. He W. Chen B. Hach-Wunderle V.

In tissues others than tumors, tissue factor is not expressed (with the exception of the spleen) in the endothelial lining even after treatment with lethal endotoxin concentrations (9Drake T.A. Cheng J. Chang A. Taylor Jr., F.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1458-1470PubMed Google Scholar). What bans tissue factor from the endothelium under physiological conditions and what enables tissue factor expression in certain tumors are not understood. In contrast to the in vivo situation, in vitrotissue factor expression on the surface of endothelial cells can be induced by TNF, interleukin-1, and VEGF (10Nawroth P.P. Stern D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 11Bevilacqua M.P. Pober J.S. Majeu G.R. Cotran R.S. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Exp.

The ability of TNF to induce tissue factor in endothelial cells could be linked to the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB) (12Bierhaus A. Zhang Y. Deng Y. Mackman N. Quehenberger P.

Biol. 1995; 15: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Recently, endothelial tissue factor induction by VEGF was found to be independent of NFκB but because of the induction or activation of the transcription factors Egr-1 and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (15Armesilla A.L.

Binder B.R. Hofer E. Blood. 1999; 93: 3811-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) are present on vascular endothelial cells, and VEGF signaling is mediated by receptor dimerization, leading to autophosphorylation of the cytosolic domains of these receptors. Phosphorylated VEGF receptors serve as docking sites for adapter molecules or for signaling enzymes such as PI3-kinase. VEGF has been shown to activate PI3-kinase generating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphates, which create docking sites for the protein kinase B better known as Akt (17Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A.

The IRSs of the PEPCK and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) promoters have been proposed to contribute to regulation by glucocorticoids and insulin. Forkhead (FKHR) recognizes IRS sequences, is phosphorylated in response to insulin, and mediates insulin inhibition of basal IGFBP-1 transcription in an IRS-dependent manner. Here, we investigate the contributions of FKHR and IRSs to insulin inhibition of basal and glucocorticoid-induced transcription of PEPCK and IGFBP-1. Expression of T/S/S, in which three putative protein kinase B (PKB) sites in FKHR are mutated, reduced insulin inhibition of basal expression of IGFBP-1 but not PEPCK. Mutation of the IGFBP-1 IRSs abolished insulin inhibition in the presence of T/S/S. Mutation of the PEPCK IRS had no effect on insulin inhibition in the presence of T/S/S, indicating that insulin inhibits PEPCK transcription independently of the IRS or of the putative PKB phosphorylation sites in FKHR.

However, to effectively mediate induction, the glucocorticoid receptor must interact with accessory factors bound to a variety of sites within complex glucocorticoid responseunits (GRUs).

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) found that IRSB overlaps the 3′ GRE, which was identified by footprinting and functional analysis of mutations in reporter gene assays. Subsequently, it was found that mutation of IRSA, which can bind forkhead/winged helix proteins, impairs induction by glucocorticoids, and it was suggested that these proteins may contribute to regulation of IGFBP-1 and PEPCK promoter activity by glucocorticoids and insulin (18Unterman T.G.

IRSA and IRSB are highly related to the PEPCK IRS, and the IGFBP-1 IRSs also confer insulin inhibition of basal thymidine kinase promoter activity (28Suwanichkul A. Morris S. Powell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17063-17068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly related IRSs also appear to contribute to insulin inhibition of basal glucagon and glucose-6-phosphatase transcription (30Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the effect of mutation of the PEPCK IRS on regulation by insulin in the context of the endogenous PEPCK promoter and the roles of forkhead proteins and the IRS in mediating insulin inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced IGFBP-1 transcription have not been reported.

Previous studies showed that insulin activation of PKB and phosphorylation of FKHR are required for inhibition of basal IGFBP-1 transcription (38Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J.

FKHR expression increased IGFBP-1 basal activity in an IRS-dependent manner, an effect that was inhibited by insulin or constitutively active Myr-PKB (38Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Mutation of three putative PKB phosphorylation sites in FKHR to alanine (Thr-24, Ser-256, Ser-319 (T/S/S)) or of Ser-256 alone abolished inhibition of IGFBP-1 transcription by insulin or Myr-PKB, and mutation of Ser-256 to an aspartate residue, a negatively charged amino acid mimicking the effect of phosphorylation, limited induction (38Guo S.

Expression of antisense FKHR mRNA reduced IGFBP-1 basal activity to the same extent as insulin or myr-PKB (38Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol.

Thus, insulin- or PKB-mediated phosphorylation of FKHR can inhibit basal IGFBP-1 transcription (38Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol.

However, these previous studies did not assess the roles of the IRS or FKHR in insulin inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced transcription. In this paper, we investigated the contribution of FKHR and the IRSs of the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 promoters to basal as well as glucocorticoid-induced transcription and their inhibition by insulin in H4IIe cells, which regulate PEPCK and IGFBP-1 transcription as in vivo (5Sasaki K.

Lacson R.G. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter gene constructs under control of the PEPCK or IGFBP-1 promoters containing either wild type or mutated IRSs were transfected into H4IIe cells together with expression vectors for either wild type FKHR or a mutant in which three sites that can be phosphorylated by PKB (Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319) are changed to alanines (T/S/S). A DNA binding-defective FKHR (H3-mut (43Schmoll D. Walker K.S. Alessi D.R. Grempler R. Burchell A. Guo S. Walther R. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36324-36333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar)) also was tested for its ability to induce basal transcription from PEPCK and IGFBP-1 promoters. Our results show that gene- and activation-specific mechanisms of insulin inhibition exist to regulate PEPCK and IGFBP-1 transcription. FKHR and IRS mediated insulin inhibition of basal, but not glucocorticoid-induced, IGFBP-1 transcription, whereas neither the IRS nor the phosphorylation of putative PKB sites in FKHR appear to be required for insulin regulation of basal or glucocorticoid-induced PEPCK gene transcription. H4IIe cells were grown and transfected as previously described (44Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14375-14378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Xing L.P. Quinn P.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1484-1494PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were transfected in solution with 10 μg of luciferase (firefly) reporter plus 1 μg of each expression plasmid plus 1 μg of pRL-SV (Renilla luciferase, Promega Corp.) reporter to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. Expression plasmids were omitted in transfections designated None. Half of the cells were seeded into each of two 60-mm dishes, one of which served as a control, whereas the other was later treated with 10 nminsulin. After ∼6 h, the cells were treated with 20% Me2SO for 3 min, washed in PBS, and then incubated in fresh medium with or without 0.5 μm dexamethasone and/or 10 nm insulin for ∼24 h. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA and lysed, and luciferase activities for the firefly andRenilla luciferase reporters were measured with the dual luciferase kit (Promega) using an ALL Monolight 3010 dual injector luminometer. Variations in PEPCK or IGFBP-1 promoter firefly luciferase activity due to variations in transfection efficiency were corrected for by measuring Renilla luciferase activity in the same sample. Values were normalized for transfection efficiency, and the mean was computed for several experiments. All figures represent the results of at least three independent transfection experiments, each of which was normalized to the untreated wild type control, and the data were combined for analysis. The number of experiments for each figure is indicated in the figure legends. The PEPCK-Luc luciferase reporter gene constructs are based on the promoterless PGL3-basic vector encoding firefly luciferase, obtained from Promega Corp. and modified to accept PEPCK promoter fragments. Briefly, the polylinker of PGL3 was replaced with the polylinker for pQ-CAT (46Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16999-17009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to create pQ-Luc. To construct the PEPCK-Luc reporter plasmid, theHindIII/KpnI fragment of pPL9 (47Quinn P.G. Wong T.W. Magnuson M.A. Shabb J.B. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) containing the rat PEPCK promoter (−600 to +69) was inserted in pQ-Luc. The mIRS-PEPCK-Luc reporter plasmid was constructed by replacement of the corresponding HindIII/KpnI fragment with that of ΔIRS-PEPCK (45Xing L.P. Quinn P.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1484-1494PubMed Google Scholar), which converts TTTTG in the PEPCK IRS to GGGGT, the same IRS mutation shown by O'Brien et al. (26O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) to prevent insulin inhibition of IRS-tk-CAT. The wild type IGFBP-1-Luc (BP1.Luc) and mIRS-IGFBP-1-Luc (IRS.mut, in which both IRSA and IRSB are mutated) plasmids were previously described (41Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) as was the wild type FKHR and PKB phosphorylation-defective FKHR (T/S/S) (38Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IGFBP-1 promoter containing the SauI/HgaI fragment of the rat IGFBP-1 promoter, which extends 320 base pairs 5′ from the RNA cap site, was cloned immediately upstream of the luciferase cDNA in pGL2 (Promega) to produce IGFBP-1-Luc. The mIRS-IGFBP-1-Luc reporter was created using unique NheI and BamHI restriction sites to replace IRSA and IRSB with mutated sequences (CAAAACAAACTTATTTTG toCACCGACGACCAGGCCTG) as previously reported (41Cichy S.B.

The wild type FKHR and T/S/S expression vectors contain the complete FKHR cDNA cloned into pAlter.Max (41Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and mutagenesis of the putative PKB phosphorylation sites at Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 to Ala was described previously by Guo et al. (38Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The DNA binding-defective FKHR expression vector, containing a mutation of Trp-209 to Gly and His-215 to Pro, was previously described (43Schmoll D. Walker K.S. Alessi D.R. Grempler R. Burchell A. Guo S. Walther R. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36324-36333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Mutation of His-215 alone has been shown to disrupt binding of FKHR to the IGFBP-1 IRSs (48Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). G4-FKHR was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the region spanning amino acids 593–655 of FKHR with primers encoding 5′ EcoRI and 3′ PstI sites and replacement of the EcoRI/PstI fragment of C/EBP in G4-C/EBP (49Roesler W.J. Crosson S.M. Vinson C. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8068-8074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), thereby fusing amino acids 1–147 of the DNA binding domain of Gal4 to the amino terminus of the FKHR activation domain, with expression driven by the SV40 early promoter. The sequence of the final G4-FKHR product was verified by sequencing. Creation of CRG has been previously described (46Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16999-17009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is a fusion protein containing amino acids 4–147 of the DNA binding domain of Gal4 to the N terminus of the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) activation domain (amino acids 1–277). The 5XGT-Luc reporter contains 5 Gal4 binding sites linked to the PEPCK minimal promoter (−40 to +1) (50Yeagley D. Agati J. Quinn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine whether FKHR regulates basal expression of the IGFBP-1 and/or PEPCK promoters through their IRS sequences, H4IIe cells were cotransfected with luciferase reporter vectors under the control of promoters with wild type and mutated IRSs and expression vectors for FKHR or FKHR-T/S/S (T/S/S). Expression of FKHR stimulated IGFBP-1-Luc activity, which was effectively inhibited by insulin (Fig.1 A). In contrast, expression of T/S/S, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKB, also stimulated IGFBP-1-Luc, but was only partially inhibited by insulin. Mutation of IRSA and IRSB in the IGFBP-1 promoter caused a decrease in basal luciferase activity (Fig. 1 B) and also decreased insulin inhibition of basal activity by ∼50%. Previous reports show that mutation of the IGFBP-1 IRSs abolishes insulin- or PKB-mediated regulation of basal IGFBP-1 activity in HepG2 cells (38Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 41Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Expression of either FKHR or T/S/S increased activity of mIRS-IGFBP-1-Luc, although to a lesser extent than for IGFBP-1-Luc, indicating that FKHR interacts with other sites in the IGFBP-1 construct when overexpressed in H4IIe cells. Insulin inhibited mIRS-IGFBP-1 promoter activity stimulated by FKHR by 50% but not that stimulated by T/S/S. This difference in the effectiveness of insulin in suppressing T/S/S-enhanced transcription of the wild type and mIRS-IGFBP-1 promoters may indicate that another IRS-associated factor contributes to induction but not inhibition by insulin in H4IIe cells, or that insulin suppresses transactivation by IRS-associated FKHR in H4IIe cells through a mechanism that does not require phosphorylation of the FKHR sites mutated in T/S/S. PEPCK-Luc expression was inhibited by insulin and stimulated by expression of FKHR or T/S/S (Fig.2 A). As with IGFBP-1, expression of FKHR had no effect on insulin inhibition. However, in contrast to the pattern seen with IGFBP-1, expression of T/S/S had little effect on insulin inhibition, suggesting that phosphorylation of putative PKB sites in FKHR is not required for insulin inhibition of basal PEPCK promoter activity. Also, mutation of the PEPCK IRS had no effect on basal activity or its inhibition by insulin (Fig.2 B), indicating that the IRS is not required for inhibition of basal transcription. The stimulatory activity of FKHR or T/S/S was reduced in mIRS-PEPCK-Luc, but the ability of insulin to inhibit was unaffected. Together, these results indicate that the activity of the IGFBP-1 and PEPCK IRSs and their association with FKHR are context-dependent. The IGFBP-1 IRSs are crucial for strong FKHR activation, and the putative PKB phosphorylation sites in FKHR contribute to insulin inhibition of basal IGFBP-1 transcription. In contrast, FKHR stimulates PEPCK to a lesser extent than it does IGFBP-1, and neither the IRS nor phosphorylation of putative PKB sites are required for insulin inhibition of basal PEPCK promoter activity. Both the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IRSs are positioned within glucocorticoid response units, and they have been suggested to disrupt the inducer complex to mediate insulin inhibition of glucocorticoid induction (18Unterman T.G.

Previously, we found that the yeast Q-SNARE Vti1p is involved in transport to the cis-Golgi, to the prevacuole/late endosome, and to the vacuole. Here we identified a previously uncharacterized gene, VTS1, and the R-SNAREYKT6 both as multicopy and as low copy suppressors of the growth and vacuolar transport defect in vti1–2 cells. Ykt6p was known to function in retrograde traffic to the cis-Golgi and homotypic vacuolar fusion. We found that VTI1 andYKT6 also interacted in traffic to the prevacuole and vacuole, indicating that these SNARE complexes contain Ykt6p, Vti1p, plus Pep12p and Ykt6p, Vti1p, Vam3p, plus Vam7p, respectively. As Ykt6p was required for several transport steps, R-SNAREs cannot be the sole determinants of specificity. To study the role of the 0 layer in the SNARE motif, we introduced the mutations vti1-Q158R andykt6-R165Q.

Recognition of the correct target requires interactions between specific members of the Rab/YPT family of small GTPases, tether proteins and SNARE1 proteins (2Waters M.G. Hughson F.M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These SNARE proteins constitute a large, evolutionary conserved family (3Jahn R. Sudhof T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Vesicle-associated SNAREs are found on transport vesicles, target membrane-associated SNAREs on target membranes. In most cases SNAREs are attached to the membrane by a C-terminal transmembrane domain or by hydrophobic posttranslational modifications. The SNARE motif, a highly conserved domain of 60 amino acid residues, is found next to the membrane anchor. Four different SNARE motifs form a parallel helical bundle with 16 layers (numbered from −7 to +8) of interacting amino acid side chains pointing toward the center of the bundle in the neuronal SNARE complex (4Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Most layers consist of four hydrophobic amino acid residues. However, in the central 0 layer, an arginine (R) from synaptobrevin interacts with three glutamines (Q) from syntaxin 1 and both SNAP-25 helices. These residues are very conserved, leading to a reclassification of SNAREs into R- and Q-SNAREs (5Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95 (14786): 15781Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a parallel four-helix bundle with one R- and three Q-SNARE helices is a common feature of SNARE complexes. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven a powerful model system to study membrane traffic and to test the SNARE hypothesis (6Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-one SNAREs, among them 5 R-SNAREs, have been identified in yeast (7Götte M. Fischer von Mollard G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 215-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Pelham H.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). All of them have been assigned to one or more traffic steps. However, the exact compositions of the SNARE complexes are not clear for many transport steps. Earlier, we described the Q-SNARE Vti1p, which is required for several transport steps in yeast. Vti1p interacts with the syntaxin-related cis-Golgi Q-SNARE Sed5p in a retrograde traffic step to the cis-Golgi (9Fischer von Mollard G. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 10Lupashin V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. McNew J.A. Waters M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2659-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The R-SNARE Ykt6p and the Q-SNARE Sft1p have been implicated in this transport step as well (11McNew J.A. Søgaard M. Lampen N.M. Machida S. Ye R.R. Lacomis L. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17776-17783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 12Banfield D.K. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Nature. 1995; 375: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Vti1p and the syntaxin-related endosomal Q-SNARE Pep12p are the only SNAREs identified so far in transport from the Golgi to the prevacuolar/late endosomal compartment (9Fischer von Mollard G. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 13Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This transport pathway is used by many vacuolar proteins, for example by carboxypeptidase Y (CPY). These proteins are transported in a second step from the prevacuole to the vacuole (14Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A different pathway to the vacuole is used by alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which travels in vesicles from the Golgi to the vacuole without passage through the prevacuole. A third vacuolar pathway is taken by aminopeptidase I (API) and autophagosomes. API is synthesized in the cytosol, packaged into cytosol to vacuole transport (CVT) vesicles enclosed by double membranes in a process similar to autophagocytosis (15Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The outer membrane of CVT vesicles and autophagosomes fuses with the vacuole. The same Q-SNAREs Vam3p, Vam7p, and Vti1p are required for these three biosynthetic pathways to the vacuole (16Sato T.K. Darsow T. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5308-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 17Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 18Wada Y.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1719-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas an R-SNARE has not yet been identified. The vacuolar R-SNARE Nyv1p has been excluded as the missing R-SNARE because these transport pathways are not affected by deletion of NYV1 and a genetic interaction between the vti1–2 mutant and NYV1was not observed (20Fischer von Mollard G. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1719-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Vacuoles can also undergo homotypic fusion. The Q-SNAREs Vam3p, Vam7p, and Vti1p together with the R-SNAREs Nyv1p and Ykt6p have been implicated in homotypic vacuolar fusion (21Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R.B. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 22Ungermann C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3269-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Ungermann C. Fischer von Mollard G. Jensen O.N. Margolis N. Stevens T.H. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We set out to identify proteins that are required together with Vti1p for transport to the vacuole. Genetic interactions have proven a valuable tool for this purpose. vti1–2 is a useful mutant allele for such studies because transport from the Golgi to the prevacuole and all transport steps to the vacuole are blocked at nonpermissive temperature but transport to the cis-Golgi is not affected. vti1–2 has the amino acid exchanges S130P in the −8 layer and I151T in the −2 layer of the SNARE motif (24Fischer von Mollard G. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2624-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Two genes were identified as suppressors for vti1–2. One was an uncharacterized ORF, the other was the R-SNARE YKT6, which we identified here as the R-SNARE in transport to the prevacuole and to the vacuole. We investigated the role of the amino acid residues in the 0 layer of Ykt6p and Vti1p. These SNARE complexes are nonfunctional with four glutamine residues and defective with two arginine and two glutamine residues in the 0 layer. Reagents were used from the following sources: enzymes for DNA manipulation from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), [35S]methionine from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech(Braunschweig, Germany), fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin) from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), and Zymolyase from Seikagaku (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid manipulations were performed in the Escherichia colistrains MC1061 or XL1Blue using standard media.

To identify multicopy suppressors that allowed vti1–2 cells to grow faster at 37 °C, we transformed FvMY22 cells with a YEp24 2-μm library (25Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated from colonies that showed improved growth at 37 °C and retransformed into FvMY22 cells to confirm suppressor activity. To compare growth rates, cells were grown in YEPD to anA600 between 0.2 and 1.0. After dilution to 0.01 and 0.05 A600/ml, 10 μl were spotted onto YEPD plates and grown at the indicated temperature. Precise deletions of theVTS1 ORF were generated by PCR (amplification of HIS3 with oligonucleotides annealing to 40 nucleotides of the VTS1flanking region) in SEY6210, FvMY7, and FvMY24, resulting in the strains MDY1, MDY4, and MDY5 (Table I), respectively (26Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The same method was used to introduce theykt6Δ::URA3 mutation into SEY6211×FvMY6 diploid cells carrying a heterocygotevti1Δ::HIS3 mutation yielding BKY6. A 1.1-kb fragment coding for the YKT6 ORF was PCR-amplified using the oligonucleotides cgggatcctacttccagttggtaattg and ggaattcactgaagaaacaaatcaattct and cloned via BamHI andEcoRI sites into YEp352 (Ref. 27Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagologg A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar; pMD1, TableII) and pRS316 (Ref. 28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; pMD21). A 2.3-kbClaI-SpeI fragment encoding VTS1 was isolated from the suppressor plasmid pBK24 and subcloned into pBluescript. The fragment was cut out withKpnI-SpeI and cloned into YEp352 (pMD3) and pRS316 (pMD9). To introduce a N-terminal triple HA tag intoVTS1, a BamHI site was generated after the start codon by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Ref. 29Weiner M.P. Felts K.A. Simcox T.G. Braman J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar; oligonucleotides ccaaaacatccgtatgaggaattc and atccatgatttctttgctgacaattac) and a 126-base pair BglII fragment encoding three copies of the HA epitope was ligated into the BamHI site (pMD8). pBK65 was constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis with the oligonucleotides cagaacattctcaatcgttttgtg and cagcaaggtgaaaagttggataatttg to generate the mutationykt6-R165Q and a silent PstI site in pMD1. The inserts of pMD1 and pBK65 were subcloned into YEp351 and pRS315 to obtain pBK99 (YKT6 in YEp351), pBK86 (ykt6-R165Q in YEp351), and pBK87 (ykt6-R165Q in pRS315). The mutation Q158R and a silent NruI site were introduced into theVTI1 encoding plasmid pFvM28 by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, using the oligonucleotides cgaccttaaatccatcattatttg and cgaagagaaactttggaaaatgcaag (pBK77). vti1-Q158R was subcloned into the integration vector pRS306, linearized, and integrated into SEY6211, and the wild-type VTI1 was looped out on 5-fluorourotic acid plates (30Boeke J.D.

Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A BAS1000 (Fuji) was used for quantification. Subcellular fractionation was performed by differential centrifugation as described (34Paravicini G. Horazdovsky B.F. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).vts1Δ cells expressing HA-VTS1 from aCEN6 plasmid were spheroplasted, osmotically lysed, and centrifuged. Fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted, and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies via ECL. The goal of this study was to identify genes that interact with VTI1 in transport from the Golgi to the prevacuolar compartment/late endosome or in transport to the vacuole. These transport steps are blocked invti1–2 cells at the non-permissive temperature, whereas transport to the Golgi is not affected (9Fischer von Mollard G. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20Fischer von Mollard G. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1719-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). vti1–2cells also display a growth defect at 37 °C, which we utilized for a multicopy (2 μm) suppressor screen. As expected, plasmids encoding for VTI1 or the endosomal Q-SNARE PEP12 (20Fischer von Mollard G. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1719-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) restored growth of vti1–2 cells at 37 °C. Two additional plasmids enhanced growth rates of vti1–2 cells at 37 °C (Fig. 1). One plasmid contained an 11-kb fragment of chromosome XI between nucleotides 69,529 and 80,400. The R-SNARE Ykt6p is encoded by this DNA fragment. YKT6interacts genetically with VTI1 in retrograde traffic to the cis-Golgi (10Lupashin V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. McNew J.A. Waters M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2659-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Ykt6p is also required for homotypic vacuolar fusion and can be immunoprecipitated with Vti1p (23Ungermann C. Fischer von Mollard G. Jensen O.N. Margolis N. Stevens T.H. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A 1.1-kb fragment encoding only YKT6 was subcloned into a 2-μm and a centromeric vector to determine whether YKT6 is the suppressor. The growth defect of vti1–2 cells at 37 °C was suppressed by overexpression of YKT6 alone from either a centromeric plasmid (1–3 copies) or a 2-μm plasmid (10–20 copies/yeast cell; Fig. 1, top). These data indicate that a slight overexpression of YKT6 is sufficient for suppression of the growth defect. The second suppressing plasmid consisted of chromosome XV nucleotides 1,009,767 to 1,014,198. Two complete reading frames were identified within this fragment: HAP5, a component of a transcription factor; and the hypothetical open reading frame YOR359w. A 2.3-kb fragment encoding only YOR359w was subcloned into a 2-μm and a centromeric plasmid. Both plasmids improved growth ofvti1–2 cells at 37 °C (Fig. 1, bottom). YOR359w was also overexpressed in vti1–11 cells, which show a severe growth defect at 37 °C in addition to defects in transport to the cis-Golgi, to the prevacuole, and to the vacuole (9Fischer von Mollard G. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The growth defect in vti1–11 cells was not suppressed by overexpression of YOR359w (data not shown), suggesting that the suppression by YOR359w is allele-specific and not due to a general bypass of VTI1 function. Therefore, YOR359w was namedVTS1 (vt i1–2 suppressor). VTS1 encodes a predicted protein of 523 amino acid residues without hydrophobic stretches typical for transmembrane domains. Data bank searches revealed only two proteins of similar length with an overall sequence homology in the yeastCandida albicans (28% amino acid identity, GenBank™ accession no. AL033497) and in the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe (24% amino acid identity, GenBank™ accession no. CAB89878). These proteins share a SAM (sterile α motif) at their C termini (see “Discussion”). To determine what trafficking step is suppressed, we examined the effect of overexpression ofVTS1 on protein traffic to the vacuole in vti1–2cells. CPY is transported from the Golgi first to the prevacuolar compartment and in a second transport step from there to the vacuole (6Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). vti1–2 cells are blocked in both trafficking steps. vti1–2 cells and vti1–2 cells overexpressing VTS1 were grown at 24 °C, shifted to 32 °C for 15 min, pulsed with [35S]cysteine/methionine for 10 min, and chased in the presence of unlabeled cysteine/methionine for 30 min. Cells were spheroplasted, and CPY was immunoprecipitated. In vti1–2 cells as well as in vti1–2 cells overexpressing VTS1, CPY did not reach the vacuole, as indicated by the lack of mCPY within the cells (Fig.2 A, I fractions). Almost all CPY was secreted as the Golgi-modified form p2CPY (E). As CPY transport from the Golgi to the prevacuole is blocked in vti1–1 cells whereas traffic to the vacuole is not affected, vti1–1 cells were used to distinguish between these steps (9Fischer von Mollard G. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20Fischer von Mollard G. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1719-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Overexpression ofVTS1 in vti1–1 cells did not suppress the defect in CPY transport from the Golgi to the prevacuole (data not shown). ALP is transported from the Golgi to the vacuole without passing through the prevacuole (6Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). ALP traffic was investigated invti1–2 cells using similar pulse-chase experiments at 36 °C (Fig. 2 C). In wild-type cells, 95% mALP are typical after a 30-min chase (data not shown), whereas, invti1–2 cells, an average of 47% mALP (S.D. 4.1) was detected. Overexpression of VTS1 either from the 2-μm library plasmid or from the 2-μm VTS1 plasmid improved ALP traffic to the vacuole considerably, as indicated by the rise in vacuolar mALP to an average of 76.8% (S.D. 3.1) and 70.5% (S.D. 1.8;n = 3), respectively. A slight overexpression ofVTS1 due to the presence of a centromeric plasmid in addition to the genomic copy of VTS1 suppressed the ALP sorting defect slightly (average of 62%, S.D. 8). API does not enter the secretory pathway but is synthesized in the cytosol and packaged into CVT vesicles surrounded by double membranes in a trafficking pathway related to autophagy (15Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). API was immunoprecipitated after a 10-min pulse and a 120-min chase at 37 °C (Fig. 2 B). Overexpression of VTS1 from either a 2-μm or a centromeric plasmid partially suppressed the API sorting defect invti1–2 cells (vti1–2 25.5% mAPI, S.D. 9.3;vti1–2 2-μm VTS1 54.8%, S.D. 8.8;vti1–2 CEN VTS1 52.9%, S.D. 7.4; n = 3). These data indicate that VTS1 genetically interacts withVTI1 in traffic to the vacuole but not in traffic from the Golgi to the prevacuole. Next we wanted to determine the consequences of a lack of Vts1p.VTS1 was deleted in wild type, vti1–1, andvti1–2 cells. vts1Δ cells did not display defects in traffic of CPY, ALP, or API to the vacuole (data not shown). Defects in CPY, ALP, and API transport were identical invti1–2 and vti1–2 vts1Δ and invti1–1 and vti1–1 vts1Δ cells, respectively, indicating a lack of a synthetic defect in protein transport (data not shown). Neither vts1Δ nor vti1–1 vts1Δ cells displayed a growth defect at 24 °C or 37 °C (Fig.3). vti1–2 and vti1–2 vts1Δ cells grew with similar rates at 24 °C. At 37 °Cvti1–2 cells grew slowly, whereas vti1–2 vts1Δ cells did not grow at all. These data indicate thatvti1–2 and vts1Δ have a synthetic growth defect at high temperature as an additional genetic interaction. To study the subcellular localization of Vts1p, three copies of the influenza HA tag were introduced at the N terminus of theVTS1 open reading frame. HA-Vts1p was functional because production of HA-Vts1p in vti1–2 vts1Δ cells restored slow growth at 37 °C (data not shown). HA-Vts1p was found exclusively in the supernatant of a 200,000 × gcentrifugation during subcellular fractionation and was not found on membranes in immunofluorescence experiments (data not shown). These data indicate Vts1p is not associated with membranes under normal conditions. Next we investigated whether Vti1p and HA-Vts1p interact physically. As Vti1p is a membrane protein, binding between both proteins could be transient at most or involve only a small amount of Vts1p. HA-Vts1p and Vti1p did not co-immunoprecipitate. Furthermore, they could not be chemically cross-linked (data not shown). In vitro binding assays using recombinant GST-Vti1p and 6-His-Vts1p fusion proteins and vice versa did not reveal a specific interaction between both proteins (data not shown). In conclusion, we found genetic interactions between VTS1and vti1–2. This suppression affected transport to the vacuole, was specific for a certain allele of vti1, and therefore was not due to a general effect of VTS1overexpression. We could not detect biochemical interactions between Vts1p and Vti1p. The mechanism of the genetic interaction betweenVTI1 and VTS1 remains to be elucidated. After identifyingYKT6 as a multicopy suppressor of the growth defect invti1–2 cells, we investigated whether YKT6overexpression affected different trafficking steps. API transport was followed in vti1–2 cells and vti1–2 cells in which YKT6 was overexpressed from either a centromeric or a 2-μm plasmid (Fig. 4 A). Overexpression of YKT6 increased the proportion of vacuolar mAPI from 20.9% (S.D. 6.4) to 54.1% (S.D. 0.8) for vti1–2cells with the 2-μm plasmid encoding only YKT6 and to 65.1% (S.D. 0.9) with the 11-kb genomic 2-μm plasmid encodingYKT6 (data not shown). A slight overexpression ofYKT6 from a centromeric plasmid resulting in intermediate amounts of mAPI. ALP transport was investigated in the same strains (Fig. 4 B). Overproduction of Ykt6p from the 2-μm plasmid resulted reproducibly in an improved delivery of ALP to the vacuole, as indicated by increased amounts of mALP after a 30-min chase period. The amount of mALP detected in vti1–2 cells varied between experiments with an average of 38.6%. In vti1–2 2-μmYKT6 cells, an average of 57.9% mALP was found, an increase by 21.3 percentage points (S.D. 4.1; n = 6). The ALP transport defect was also suppressed by the 11-kb genomic 2-μm plasmid encoding YKT6 (increase by 23.1 percentage points, S.D. 4.9, data not shown). A slight overexpression of YKT6using a centromeric plasmid improved ALP transport to the vacuole somewhat. Next we determined whether this effect is specific for Ykt6p or whether other R-SNAREs can function in this transport step. Snc2p (required for exocytosis and endocytosis; Refs. 36Rossi G.

https://openalex.org/W2084428683,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is involved in the physiological and biological abnormalities found in two opposite metabolic situations: cachexia and obesity. In an attempt to identify novel genes and proteins that could mediate the effects of TNFα on adipocyte metabolism and development, we have used a differential display technique comparing 3T3-L1 cells exposed or not to the cytokine. We have isolated a novel adipose cDNA encoding a TNFα-inducible 470-amino acid protein termed TIARP, with six putative transmembrane regions flanked by a large amino-terminal and a short carboxyl-terminal domain, a structure reminiscent of channel and transporter proteins. Commitment into the differentiation process is required for cytokine responsiveness. The differentiation processper se is accompanied by a sharp emergence of TIARP mRNA transcripts, in parallel with the expression of the protein at the plasma membrane. Transcripts are present at high levels in white and brown adipose tissues, and are also detectable in liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle. Whereas the biological function of TIARP is presently unknown, its pattern of expression during adipose conversion and in response to TNFα exposure as a transmembrane protein mainly located at the cell surface suggest that TIARP might participate in adipocyte development and metabolism and mediate some TNFα effects on the fat cell as a channel or a transporter.

In addition to its immunological functions, TNFα also markedly alters adipose tissue development and metabolism. Surprisingly, TNFα seems to be involved in the pathophysiology of two opposite metabolic disorders (1Argilés J.M. Lopez-Soriano J. Busquets S. Lopez-Soriano F.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). High plasma levels of TNFα likely play an important role in the onset of cachectic states observed during cancer or severe infectious diseases (2Beutler B. Cerami A. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). By contrast, more recent studies have indicated that the cytokine is overexpressed in adipose tissue of obese rodents or humans, and that this locally produced TNFα may be involved in the obesity-linked insulin resistance (3Moller D.E. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 212-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Thus, since abnormalities in its production or action are associated with alterations in body fat mass, TNFα is likely an important effector of adipose tissue development and metabolism in vivo. Many in vitro studies also support the view that TNFα has profound effects on lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation. TNFα was reported to inhibit lipid storage by reducing synthesis and activity of several proteins essential for lipogenesis, such as lipoprotein lipase (4Kawakami M. Pekala P.H. Lane M.D. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (5Pekala P.H. Kawakami M. Vine W. Lane M.D. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1360-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), or by inhibition in the expression and/or function of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 pathway (6Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Otherwise TNFα is able to stimulate lipolysis in adipocytes by different mechanisms (7Souza S.C. Moitoso de Vargas L. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 8Gasic S. Tian B. Green A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6770-6775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition to the above effects on lipid storage or mobilization, TNFα potently inhibits adipose conversion and even causes a dramatic de-differentiation of adipocytes in culture (9Torti F.M. Dieckmann B. Beutler B. Cerami A. Ringold G.M. Science. 1985; 229: 867-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Prevention of adipose conversion by TNFα has been essentially related to reduction in C/EBPα and PPARγ expression, two key adipogenic transcription factors (6Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang B. Berger J. Szalkowski D. White-Carrington S. Spiegelman B.M. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These observations underline that TNFα controls the adipocyte phenotype not only by opposite regulations of lipid storage and mobilization, but also through the blockade of adipocyte differentiation. More recently, it has been suggested that TNFα could also inhibit adipose tissue development by inducing preadipocyte and adipocyte apoptosis (11Prins J.B. Niesler C.U. Winterford C.M. Bright N.A. Siddle K. O'Rahilly S. Walker N.I. Cameron D.P. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Porras A. Alvarez A.M. Valladares A. Benito M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, some of the molecular mechanisms at the basis of these potent effects of TNFα are still unknown. Thus, identification of novel genes and proteins that could mediate the effects of the cytokine on the adipose cell remains an important issue. Under appropriate culture conditions, 3T3-L1 cells differentiate into fat-laden adipocytes (13Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 14Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Moreover, this murine preadipose cell line has been extensively employed to characterize TNFα effects on adipocyte metabolism and differentiation. Using a differential display approach, we have identified a novel mRNA that is largely induced by TNFα in differentiating and in mature 3T3-L1 cells. This mRNA encodes a new protein of 470 amino acids termed TIARP for “TNFα-induced adipose-related protein.” Sequence analysis predicts that TIARP has a large NH2-terminal domain, followed by six transmembrane domains reminiscent of the general structure of numerous channels. This transmembrane portion of the protein shares a significant homology with STEAP (for six transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate) and pHyde, two proteins that are highly expressed in human prostate tissues (15Hubert R.S. Vivanco I. Chen E. Rastegar S. Leong K. Mitchell S.C. Madraswala R. Zhou Y. Kuo J. Raitano A.B. Jakobovits A. Saffran D.C. Afar D.E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14523-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 16Steiner M.S. Zhang X. Wang Y. Lu Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4419-4425PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of this novel gene dramatically increases during TNFα exposure, but also during the course of 3T3-L1 adipose differentiation. Tissue distribution of TIARP mRNA is not restricted to white and brown adipose tissues, but is also detectable in liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that the TIARP protein is prominently expressed at the level of the plasma membrane. Thus, our results indicate the presence of a new transmembrane protein that is highly regulated by TNFα and by the adipocyte differentiation process. Further investigations will provide new insights into the exact functional properties of TIARP in adipocyte and the physiological and/or pathological relationship with the TNFα-induced expression of this protein. Stocks of murine 3T3-C2 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained as described (13Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (739) Google Scholar,14Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). For experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 104/cm2 in plastic culture dishes (Falcon), and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biomedia, Boussens, France), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 10% CO2 humified atmosphere. For 3T3-L1 cells, differentiation was initiated by administration at confluence of methylisobutylxanthine (100 μm), dexamethasone (0.25 μm), and insulin (1 μg/ml) for 48 h, then cells were refed by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1 μg/ml insulin (17Rubin C.S. Hirsch A. Fung C. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7570-7578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this protocol, more than 95% of the cells acquired an adipocyte morphology at day 7 following confluence. The cultured cells were either left untreated or exposed to murine TNFα (Genzyme, Cambridge) for the indicated periods and at the indicated concentrations. Cultures of murine NIH-3T3 and C3H10T1/2 fibroblastic cell lines were grown by the same protocol as for 3T3-L1 cells. Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were performed according to Foretz et al. (18Foretz M. Carling D. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14767-14771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). mRNA differential display was performed by the general procedure of Liang and Pardee (19Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4689) Google Scholar), modified according to Sokolov and Prockop (20Sokolov B.P. Prockop D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from day 2 post-confluent 3T3-L1 cells exposed or not for 6 h to 0.5 nm TNFα. 0.25 μg of RNA was used for reverse transcription reaction with 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 μm random hexanucleotides, and 3 mmMgCl2. 4 μl of the reverse-transcribed cDNA was used for each PCR reaction. PCR amplification was performed in a 25-μl volume containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.55, 16 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 125 μm of each dNTP, 500 nm of the two oligonucleotides, and 1 unit ofTaq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). A set of arbitrary oligonucleotides of 10–23-mer in length was used. The sequences of the primers that gave the differentially expressed PCR product were 5′-ATGAAAGCCTTCAGGTCCGGTGAG-3′ and 5′-GCCACAGAGTACTTTGCTATCATT-3′. Parameters for PCR were 28 cycles of denaturating at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension of 5 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and stained by ethidium bromide. The candidate PCR product was excised from the gel using the Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, Inc.), reamplified with the same primers, then cloned into TA cloning vector (pGEM-T Easy, Promega Inc.). The PCR product obtained from the differential display was about 310 base pairs (bp) in length. This radiolabeled fragment was used to screen for the full-length cDNA in a cDNA library constructed in the pGEM-11Zf(−) plasmid (Promega, Inc.), and derived from mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed for 6 h to 0.5 nm TNFα. Sequencing of the initial PCR product was determined by dideoxysequencing with Sequenase version 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Final sequencing of the full-length cDNA was performed by Genome Express (Montreuil, France). A Blastn search on the GenBankTM data base at the Centre de Ressources Infobiogen (Evry, France) was performed. The nucleotide and deduced protein sequences were determined and analyzed for patterns, motifs, domains, or alignments by exploring the available sequence data bases provided by the web tools through the Centre de Ressources Infobiogen. Purified 3080-bp cDNA was cloned into the pGEM-11Zf(−) vector (Promega Inc.). 1 μg of plasmid DNA was submitted to in vitro transcription and translation using a TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. [35S]Methionine (1175 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml, ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) was used to label the translated protein. Control translation reactions using empty pGEM-11Zf(−) vector and luciferase control DNA were performed. Proteins were resolved by denaturating 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Labeled protein bands were visualized by fluorography. After fixation the gel was exposed to Amplify reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) then dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat for 20 h at −70 °C. Molecular markers were from Bio-Rad. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells as described by Cathala et al. (22Cathala C. Savouret J.F. Mendez B. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA. 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar) and from 12-week-old Wistar rat tissues by the acid phenol-chloroform procedure (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). Ten to twenty μg of RNA were separated in a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde and transferred onto nylon membranes (Nylon plus, Schleicher and Schuell). Methylene blue staining of blots was achieved to control the similarity in RNA loading. Hybridization with various32P-labeled probes was performed as described by Church and Gilbert (24Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7264) Google Scholar). Final washing was carried out in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate in 0.2 × SSC (1 × SSC: 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 15 min at 60 °C. The 310-bp fragment initially derived from the differential display procedure was used as a probe to detect TIARP mRNA. The other DNA probes have been described elsewhere (25Spiegelman B.M. Frank M. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10083-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were analyzed by scanning signals on a videodensitometer (Vilbert-Lourmat Imaging). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the TIARP protein (Quantum Appligene, Ilkirch, France) was generated toward the amino-terminal peptide HADEFPLTTDSSEKQG coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and affinity purified by antigen affinity purification. For immunofluorescence staining, 3T3-L1 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and grown following the above described procedures. At the times indicated, the attached cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min. They were rinsed three times with PBS, then permeabilized with 0.1% saponin (Sigma) in PBS for another 30-min period, washed three times with PBS, and post-fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. They were then exposed to 100 mm glycine in PBS for 10 min. After washing in PBS (5 times), the cells were incubated with blocking medium containing 3% bovine serum albumin, essentially fatty acid- and globulin-free (Sigma), then covered with rabbit polyclonal antiserum (anti-TIARP) (1:250 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin). After incubation for 1 h, the cells were washed with PBS (3 times for 5 min), then incubated in darkness with an anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG (F(ab′) fragment of goat antibody, affinity isolated) (1:160 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin; Sigma) for 45 min and for a further 15-min period with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) which colored nuclei in red. After washing (5 times for 5 min), the slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). All steps were performed at room temperature. The slides were examined using a confocal microscope (LSM510, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images series of cell slices of 0.7-μm thickness each were recorded. No staining was detectable in control experiments performed by omitting the primary antibody from the dilution buffer or by replacing the primary antibody by the preimmune serum. For Western blot analysis, the cells were rinsed with PBS, harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and broken in a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes, pestle B). Cell extracts were centrifuged at either 15,000 × g or 200,000 ×g for 90 min at 4 °C, as indicated. The resulting pellet fractions were resuspended in 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Plasma membranes were isolated as previously described (26Laudat M.H. Pairault J. Bayer M. Martin M. Laudat P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 255: 1005-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) from the 15,000 × g pellet fraction dispersed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm ATP, 250 mm sucrose, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture) and then layered on a linear sucrose gradient (27.6–54.1%, w/w) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The gradient was centrifuged in a Beckman L3 centrifuge at 60,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The upper zone under the meniscus (ρ = 1.13–1.14) was aspirated and diluted with 10 volumes of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA. Protein amounts of each fraction were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heat-denaturated samples (30 μg of protein) of total cell extracts, supernatant, pellet, or plasma membrane fractions were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) and proteins were transferred onto a polyvinyldene fluoride membrane (Biotrace, Gelman Sciences). The membrane was saturated with 5% delipidated milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween. Immunodetection was performed with rabbit polyclonal antiserum (anti-TIARP) (1:2000 dilution in 3% delipidated milk) and anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-linked species-specific whole antibody from donkey (1:20,000 dilution in 3% delipidated milk; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.). The membrane was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to a Bio-Max film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. To seek new genes that are differentially regulated by TNFα in differentiating preadipocytes, we employed a mRNA differential display procedure (19Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4689) Google Scholar, 20Sokolov B.P. Prockop D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared from day-2 post-confluent cells, cultured for 6 h in the absence or presence of 0.5 nm TNFα. cDNAs derived from the mRNAs were subsequently assayed for differential display PCR reaction in the presence of different sets of primers arbitrary in sequence. Among various PCR products detected on agarose gels, we identified a DNA fragment of about 310 bp that was present only in TNFα-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). Using this DNA fragment as a probe in Northern analysis, we confirmed that the related transcript, with an apparent size of 3.1 kb, was highly expressed in TNFα-exposed cells, but was also present at much lower levels in untreated cells (Fig. 1 B). A full-length cDNA clone was subsequently obtained by screening a cDNA library from TNFα-treated mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the 310-bp partial cDNA clone. The complete nucleotide sequence of the resulting cDNA was composed of 3080 bp. Blastn searching of the nucleic acid data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to look for sequence homologies (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59416) Google Scholar) revealed that cDNA sequence displayed significant alignments with a human clone from chromosome 7q21 (GenBankTMaccession number AC003991) (90% identity). The first ATG codon was found at position 76 from the 5′ end of the cDNA. This codon initiates an open reading frame extending up to position 1486. The deduced amino acid sequence of 470 amino acids (molecular weight = 52,937) (Fig. 2 A) was used as a query for searching at various servers. It consists in a long NH2-terminal sequence of 200 amino acid residues followed by five or six transmembrane-spanning domains (positions 201–434) and a COOH-terminal sequence. According to PROSITE analysis results, this protein was mainly characterized by the presence of an ATP/GTP-binding site motif as the P-loop at the NH2-terminal sequence (positions 26–33), an hemopexin domain signature at the junction between the cytosolic and membrane domains (positions 196–210), and three putative N-glycosylation sites. Blast search results (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59416) Google Scholar) revealed significant homologies of the NH2-terminal sequence between positions 21 and 173 with several NADP/NADPH oxidoreductases characterized in Archaea and bacteria (for instance, the sequences with accession numbers: sp/Q58896, sp/O26350, embl/CAB61935.1, dbj/BAA29608, gb/AAF10566.1, and pir/IC71165) (30% identities). Especially, the sequence of TIARP matches domains characteristic of the NADP/NADPH-dependent acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase described in Archaea, bacteria, and plants (29Biou V. Dumas R. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Job D. Pebay-Peyroula E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (positions 21–79), of the ubiquitous NAD/NADH-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (positions 22–41) and, in positions 22–124, of the KTN NAD-binding domain (Pfam analysis at St. Louis, MO; Pfam entry accession number PF02254) present in Drosophilaand bacteria (30Schlosser A. Hamann A. Bossemeyer D. Schneider E. Baker E.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 3: 533-543Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 31Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 1: 17-19Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and in a variety of proteins, including potassium channels, phosphoesterases, and other transporters. Interestingly, this domain was characterized in Escherichia coli as a putative potassium channel protein (Swiss-Prot accession number P31069) with the features of an integral membrane protein. Depending on the architecture research tools used for prediction of protein secondary structure, the amino acid sequence spanning from residue 201 to 434 defines either five (according to the SOSUI system at Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Kyoto University, Japan) or six transmembrane helices (according to Tmpred, Das Transmembrane Prediction, PRED-TMR, or HMMTOP analysis programs consulted through the Centre de Ressources Infobiogen, France). Interestingly, SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) (32Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar, 33Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P.

The entire transmembrane sequence 201–434 presents homologies with the NH2-terminal sequences of STEAP characterized in epithelia of the human prostate tissue (15Hubert R.S. Vivanco I. Chen E. Rastegar S. Leong K. Mitchell S.C. Madraswala R. Zhou Y. Kuo J. Raitano A.B. Jakobovits A. Saffran D.C. Afar D.E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14523-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number AF186249) (38% identity). Otherwise, a high degree of homology was found between the entire sequences of the protein TIARP and of the recently described “tumor suppressor pHyde,” the product of a novel tumor suppressor gene that inhibits growth of prostate cancer (16Steiner M.S. Zhang X. Wang Y. Lu Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4419-4425PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBankTMaccession number AAK00361.1) (44% identity). It is noteworthy that the homology between amino acid sequences of TIARP, pHyde, and STEAP is higher in their transmembrane parts than in their NH2-terminal portion (Fig. 2 B) (34Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar). In an in vitro transcription and translation system, the TIARP cDNA generated a protein of ∼52,000 Da in size (Fig.3), in agreement with the 52,937 Da molecular mass predicted from the cDNA sequence. To examine the tissue distribution of TIARP mRNA, we performed Northern analysis using various rat tissues (Fig.4). A single mRNA species with a size of 3.1 kilobases was expressed both in white and brown adipose tissue. These high expression levels were not restricted to adipose tissue, but were also found in heart, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Lower levels of TIARP transcripts were observed in lung and spleen, while TIARP mRNA appeared undetectable in brain and intestine. The presence of low but significant levels of TIARP mRNA in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells (Fig.1 B, lane 1) and its strong expression in white and brown adipose tissue (Fig. 4) prompted us to examine TIARP expression during the course of differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Total RNA was harvested from cells at various intervals before and after cell confluence. As shown in Fig. 5, TIARP mRNA was undetectable in growing 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (1 day before confluence), and was barely expressed at confluence (day 0) and at day 1 following confluence. Thereafter, its expression dramatically increased at day 3 and reached a maximal level at day 8 following confluence. TIARP mRNA was virtually absent in the fibroblastic 3T3-C2 cells cultured under the same culture conditions. This confirmed that the spontaneous emergence of TIARP mRNA, i.e. in the absence of TNFα addition, is a differentiation-linked event. Moreover, the kinetics of expression of TIARP mRNA appeared very similar to that of the adipocyte lipid-binding protein and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs, two well characterized markers of the adipose conversion process (25Spiegelman B.M. Frank M. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10083-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicates that TIARP mRNA induction is a late event of differentiation. Using an antibody directed against the amino-terminal sequence of the TIARP protein, we studied by confocal microscopy image analysis the expression, subcellular localization, and the fate of this protein during the 3T3-L1 adipose conversion process. Immunocytochemical analysis performed on permeabilized cells (Fig.6) revealed a faint signal within a cytoplasmic area close to the nucleus of some preadipocytes, suggestive for a Golgi localization (day 0, panel A). However, at day 2 following confluence, 3T3-L1 cells acquired TIARP immunoreactivity scattered within the cytoplasm as punctuate patterns and also at the cell periphery (panel B). Then the cell surface-associated staining progressively increased in fluorescence during adipose conversion as shown at days 5 (panel C) and 10 (panel D). In addition, at these time periods, TIARP protein also accumulated in the Golgi area (panels C and D). Reconstitution of cells in three-dimension performed from an image series of 0.7-μm thickness each indicated that in these fully differentiated cells (day 10), immunostaining was clearly associated with the entire area of the plasma membrane as discontinuous clusters, with small vesicle-like structures approaching the plasma membrane and with the Golgi area (panels E-H). Orthogonal cut-off of the cells often show strongly stained invaginations of the plasma membranes (panel H). Thus, in agreement with the profile of TIARP mRNA expression during adi"

We have used site-directed mutagenesis to generate domain-specific mutants of the receptor β subunit to analyze the role of specific tyrosines in the regulation of the invasive/metastatic phenotype. Poorly invasive M-27 carcinoma cells expressing low receptor numbers were transfected with a plasmid vector expressing IGF-I receptor cDNA in which single or multiple tyrosine codons in the kinase domain, namely Tyr-1131, Tyr-1135, and Tyr-1136 or the C-terminal tyrosines 1250 and 1251 were substituted with phenylalanine. Changes in the invasive and metastatic properties were analyzed relative to M-27 cells expressing the wild type receptor. We found that cells expressing the Y1131F,Y1135F,Y1136F or Y1135F receptor mutants lost all IGF-IR-dependent functions and their phenotypes were indistinguishable from, or suppressed relative to, the parent line. The Y1250F,Y1251F substitution abolished anchorage-independent growth, cell spreading, and the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-I whereas all other IGF-IR-dependent phenotypes were either unperturbed (i.e. mitogenicity) or only partially reduced (migration and invasion). The results identify three types of receptor-dependent functions in this model: those dependent only on an intact kinase domain (DNA synthesis), those dependent equally on kinase domain and Tyr-1250/1251 signaling (e.g.apoptosis, soft agar cloning) and those dependent on kinase domain and enhanced through Tyr-1250/1251 signaling (migration, invasion). They suggest that signals derived from both regions of the receptor cooperate to enhance tumor metastasis.

The human receptor for the type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-IR)1 is a heterotetramer consisting of two 130- to 135-kDa α and two 90- to 95-kDa β subunits with several α-α and α-β disulfide bridges (7Massague J. Czech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5038-5045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain, which is then glycosylated and proteolytically cleaved into the α and β subunits (8Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A. Tang-Feng T. Tsubodawa M. Collins C.

The ligand-binding domain is located on the extracellular α subunit. Approximately one-third of the β subunit is extracellular and is connected to the intracellular portion by a single transmembrane domain. The intracellular region of the β subunit has a binding site for phosphorylation substrates at tyrosine residue 950, an ATP-binding site at lysine 1003, a tyrosine kinase domain with three critical tyrosines at positions 1131, 1135, and 1136 and several tyrosines in the C-terminal domain at positions 1250, 1251, and 1316 known to regulate some receptor functions (9Kato H.

Recent studies have shown that the receptor plays a crucial role in the induction and maintenance of the malignant phenotype (12Baserga R. Sell C. Porcu P. Rubini M.

Acta. 1997; 1332: F105-F126Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Overexpression and/or constitutive activation of the IGF-IR lead to acquisition of a transformed phenotype (measured as growth in semi-solid agar) and tumorigenic potential (growth in immunodeficient mice) in various cell types (14Kaleko M. Rutter W. Miller D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The IGFs are potent mitogens for a range of tumor cell types in vitro, and increased expression of IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF-IR or a combination thereof have been documented in many human malignancies, including carcinomas of the lung, breast, thyroid, gastrointestinal tract and prostate, glioblastomas, neuroblastomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and leukemias (reviewed in Ref. 15Macaulay V. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Several oncogenes were shown to affect IGF-I and IGF-IR expression. Oncogene c-myb induces the expression of both IGF-I and IGF-IR whereas tumor suppressors WT1 and p53 reduce IGF-IR levels (13Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys.

In a series of studies, using two subclones of the Lewis lung carcinoma, we have recently documented a correlation between IGF-IR levels and the metastatic potential of the cells, particularly to the liver and have shown that a reduction in IGF-IR levels by antisense mRNA leads to abrogation of the metastatic phenotype whereas receptor overexpression results in the acquisition of a highly invasive/metastatic phenotype (19Long L.

Mutational analyses of the receptor, based mainly on the study of fibroblast cell lines have recently shown that the mitogenic, transforming, and cell survival functions of the IGF-IR can be segregated to different domains of the receptor β subunit. The data suggested that the receptor can probably utilize several distinct signaling pathways that may either involve, or be independent of, the known receptor substrates IRS-1 and Shc (9Kato H.

Biol. 1997; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Because overexpression of IGF-IR in M-27 cells altered multiple cellular functions, all of which can impact on the metastatic phenotype (24Long L. Rubin R. Brodt P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we sought here to utilize this model to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate metastasis-related functions of the receptor. M-27 cells were therefore transfected with plasmid vectors expressing receptor cDNA in which tyrosines in the kinase and C-terminal domains of the receptor β subunit were substituted with phenylalanines. The effect of these substitutions on different cellular functions that impact on the metastatic phenotype were then analyzed. The origin, properties, metastatic phenotype, and methods of transplantation for M-27, a clonal subline of the Lewis lung carcinoma, were described in detail previously (24Long L. Rubin R. Brodt P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Brodt P. Reich R. Moroz L.A. Chambers A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1139: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In vivo, M-27 cells form subcutaneous tumors, are moderately metastatic to lung following tail vein injection but do not spontaneously metastasize to extrapulmonary sites (31Brodt P. Reich R. Moroz L.A. Chambers A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1139: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2442-2448PubMed Google Scholar). This tumor line is maintained by subcutaneous implantation of isolated lung metastases derived from tumor-bearing mice into new recipient animals. Monolayer cultures are prepared from dispersed tumors and maintainedin vitro for up to 4 weeks in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS. A second subline of the Lewis lung carcinoma, line H-59, was used for some experiments. Its origin and properties have been described in detail in our previous communications (6Long L. Nip J. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3732-3737PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brodt P. Reich R. Moroz L.A. Chambers A.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3243-3247PubMed Google Scholar). A full-length human IGF-IR cDNA was amplified by PCR from the pCVN plasmid (24Long L. Rubin R. Brodt P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), cloned into the pMOSBlue transfer vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and then subcloned into the pCI expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using theXbaI-EcoRI cloning sites. A neomycin-resistance gene under the control of an SV-40 promoter was cloned into theHpaI site of the same vector. To generate IGF-IR mutants with Y-F substitutions, a two-step recombinant PCR method was used (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Full-length IGF-IR cDNA in pCVN was used as template. For each mutation, two common external primers spanning nucleotides 2564–2591 (P1-sense) and nucleotides 4139–4160 (P4-antisense) were used together with two unique internal primers (P2-sense and P3-antisense, respectively) containing base substitutions in the target tyrosine codons. The primary PCR products of the P1/P2 and P3/P4 reactions with 24- to 27-bp overlaps were mixed, and a 1596-bp fragment was synthesized by 3′-extension of the heteroduplex using the two external primers P1 and P4 described above. The P2 and P3 internal primers (5′ and 3′, respectively) were as follows: for Y1131F: 5′-CGCGAGATATCTTCGAGACAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTCTCGAAGATATCTCGCG-3′(antisense) for Y1135F; 5′-GATATCTATGAGACAGACTTCTACCGG-3′(sense) and 5′- CCGGTAGAAGTCTGTCTCATAGATATC (antisense) for Y1131F,Y1135F,Y1136F; 5′-CGAGATATCTTCGAGACAGACTTCTTCCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGGAAGAAGTCTGTCTCGAAGATATCTCG-3′ and for Y1250F,Y1251F; 5′-GAGGTCTCCTTCTTCTTCAGCGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCGCTGAAGAAGAAGGAGACCTC-3′. Mutated codons are indicated by underlining. Amplification was carried out in a PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) using established procedures as we previously described (19Long L. Rubin R. Baserga R. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1006-1009PubMed Google Scholar, 34Long L. Navab R. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3243-3247PubMed Google Scholar), and the amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the pMOSBlue (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfe, Quebec, Canada) multiple cloning region and then subcloned into the pCI-Neo-IGF-IR plasmid. All the mutations were confirmed by digestion with multiple restriction enzymes and manual dideoxy sequencing. The IGF-IR constructs were transfected into M-27 cells using Lipofectin, as we previously described (24Long L. Rubin R. Brodt P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI-FCS supplemented from day 2 onward with 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Neomycin-resistant cells were maintained in G418-containing medium throughout the experimental period. M-27 cells transfected with the pCI-neo vector as control were indistinguishable with respect to all phenotypes examined from non-transfected M-27 cells. IGF-I binding sites on the tumor cells were quantitated using the method of Phillips et al. (35Phillips P.D. Pignolo R.J. Cristofalo V.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, tumor cells in 24-well plates were washed with serum-free (SF)-RPMI medium, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 8–1500 pm of 125I- labeled IGF-I (2000 Ci/mmol from Amersham) in binding medium (SF-RPMI containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) with or without graded concentrations of unlabeled rH-IGF-I, rinsed with ice-cold binding medium, solubilized in 0.01 n NaOH containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS, and the radioactivity was measured in an LKB gamma counter. The number of cells/well at the time of the assay was determined from triplicate control wells, which were manipulated in the same manner and the number of IGF-I binding sites calculated using the Ligand program (36McPherson G. Comput. Programs Biomed. 1983; 17: 107-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Twenty-four-well plates were precoated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin/well. To each well 2 × 104 cells in RPMI-FCS were added, and the cells were incubated first at room temperature for 30 min and then at 37 °C for up to 5 h. Unattached cells were removed by repeated washing, and the remaining cells were fixed and enumerated using phase contrast microscopy. Cells in each of 20 random fields per well were scored as being either spread (phase dark cell extending cellular processes) or non-spread (phase bright and rounded) (37Tawil N.J. Gowri V. Djoneidi M. Nip J. Carbonetto S. Brodt P. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These assays were performed essentially as we previously described (19Long L. Rubin R. Baserga R. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1006-1009PubMed Google Scholar). Thymidine incorporation was measured after the cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of rHIGF-I (Intergen, Purchase, NY) at 37 °C for 72 h, and agar colonies were enumerated following a 12-day incubation in RPMI containing 10% FCS. Colonies that exceeded 250 μm in diameter were scored using an inverted microscope (Diaphot-TMD Inverted, Nikon Canada). Apoptosis was analyzed using the annexin V immunostaining assay. Tumor cells in monolayer cultures were grown to 80% confluency, the serum-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed repeatedly to remove traces of serum and then incubated for 48 h in SF-RPMI containing or not 10 ng/ml IGF-I. The proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using the Annexin-V-Fluos staining kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as instructed by the manufacturer. MMP-2 expression was analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and gelatin zymography. All the analyses were performed essentially as we have previously described (34Long L. Navab R. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3243-3247PubMed Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, 5 μg of TRIzol-extracted total RNA were used, and cDNA amplification was performed using 35 cycles consisting of 30 s each at 94 °C, 56 °C, and 72 °C followed by a 10-min incubation at 72 °C. The amplified DNA fragments were analyzed without further purification by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized using a MultiImage Light Cabinet DE-400 (Alpha Innotech Co.). Western blots were probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to hMMP-2 (Fuji clone 42-5D11 from Medicorp, Montreal, Canada) and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), which were incubated with the nitrocellulose membranes for 60 and 45 min, respectively. For gelatin zymography 50× concentrated SF-conditioned media harvested after cell culture for 48 h were used. Tumor cells (5 × 104 cells in SF-RPMI containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin) were plated onto 8-μm Nucleopore filters (Transwell, Corning, Acton, MA) uncoated or precoated with 7.5 μg of human placental type IV collagen (Sigma Chemical Co.). The filters were placed in 24-well plates, incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 10 ng/ml IGF-I in the lower chamber, and then fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde. After removal of the cells from the upper surface of the filters with a cotton swab, the cells on the lower surface were stained with 0.2% crystal violet and counted with the aid of a Nikon inverted microscope. Triplicate filters were used for each cell type and assay condition, and 20 random fields were counted per filter. To measure invasion, a similar protocol was used, but the filters were precoated with 0.23 mg/ml Matrigel (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) and incubation was at 37 °C for 48 h. Mice were anesthetized by an intramuscular injection of a mixture of 12.5 mg/kg ketamine (Ketalean, MTC Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Ontario, Canada) 15 mg/kg xylazine (Rompun, Bayer Inc., Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada), and 2 mg/kg acepromazine maleate (Atravet, Ayerst Laboratories, Montreal, Canada). Tumor cells (105) were inoculated by the intrasplenic/portal route, and the animals were splenectomized 1 min later, as we previously described (13Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F105-F126Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 19Long L. Rubin R. Baserga R. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1006-1009PubMed Google Scholar). The mice were sacrificed 14–16 days later, their livers were removed, and the hepatic metastases were enumerated immediately, without prior fixation. The Student t test was used to analyze the data. M-27 cells were transfected with the pCI vector expressing full-length human IGF-IR or IGF-IR cDNA in which tyrosine codons in the kinase or C-terminal domains were substituted with phenylalanine codons. To measure the numbers of IGF-I receptors on the transfected cells, we used a ligand binding assay. The results of these analyses are summarized in Table I. All transfected cell lines expressed increased receptor numbers as compared with control M-27 cells. Receptor numbers in these cells were, in fact, in the range normally expressed on the highly metastatic H-59 carcinoma cells.Table IIncreased number of IGF-1 binding sites on stably transfected M-27 and H-59 cellsCell typeSites (103)/cellKdnmA M-27-control18 ± 3.23.55 ± 0.5 M-27-WT39 ± 6.13.23 ± 0.51 M-27-Y1131F32 ± 4.13.47 ± 0.42 M-27-Y1131F,Y1135F,Y1136F32 ± 3.15.32 ± 0.71 M-27-Y1250F,Y1251F36 ± 3.54.12 ± 0.41 M-27-Y1135F36 ± 4.33.9 ± 0.63B H-59-control38 ± 4.63.66 ± 0.35 H-59-WT256 ± 314.66 ± 0.59 H-59-Y1131F,Y1135F,Y1136F78 ± 11.23.41 ± 0.31Ligand binding assay and Scatchard analysis were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as means ± S.D. of triplicate samples in a representative experiment of two performed.

M-27 cells typically grow as clusters of rounded cells and spread poorly in the presence of serum. Following transfection with WT IGF-IR, these cells assumed an elongated fibro-epithelioid morphology akin to that typically seen for the more invasive H-59 cells (Fig.1 A). To quantitate cell spreading, the cells were added to fibronectin-coated wells and incubated at 37 °C, in the presence of serum, for up to 5 h. M-27/IGF-IRWT cells but not control cells began spreading within 1 h of the incubation, reaching maximal levels at 3 h. This increase in cell spreading was abolished in cells expressing IGF-IRY1135F or IGF-IRY1131F,Y1135F,Y1136F and was markedly reduced in cells expressing IGF-IRY1250F,Y1251F or IGF-IRY1131F (Fig.1 B). The contribution of the kinase and C-terminal tyrosines to IGF-I-induced migration and invasion were tested using a Boyden chamber chemotaxis assay and a Matrigel invasion system. M-27 cells expressing WT receptors had a 5.3-fold (±0.8, n = 5) increase in IGF-I-stimulated migration relative to non-transfected cells. Y-F substitutions in kinase domain tyrosines 1135 and 1136 abolished this increase in migration whereas substitutions in tyrosines 1250 and 1251 only partially reduced it (41 ± 11%, Fig. 2 A). This effect was specific to IGF-I-induced migration, because neither overexpression of IGF-IR nor the expression of the mutated receptors significantly altered M-27 migration in response to fibronectin (not shown). Cellular invasion as measured using Matrigel-coated filters increased 5.5-fold (±1.5, n = 4) in cells expressing the WT receptor. This increase was completely abolished in cells expressing IGF-IRY1131F and reduced to below background levels in cells expressing IGF-IRY1135F or IGF-IRY1131F,Y1135F,Y1136F suggesting that, in these cells, the transfected receptor acted as a dominant negative mutant. However, invasion of cells expressing the Y1250F,Y1251F substitution was only partially reduced relative to cells expressing the WT receptor (54 ± 9%, Fig. 2 B). M-27 cells overexpressing the WT receptor expressed elevated levels of MMP-2 mRNA as determined by RT-PCR, and this was reflected in increased protein expression and enzymatic activity as determined by Western blotting and gelatin zymography, respectively. This increase in MMP-2 synthesis was abolished in cells expressing IGF-I receptors with Y-F substitutions in either the kinase domain or in residues Y1250F,Y1251F (Fig. 3). The mitogenic response to IGF-I was completely abrogated in M-27 cells expressing IGF-IR kinase domain mutations Y1135F or Y1131F,Y1135F,Y1136F and reduced in cells expressing Y1311F. In contrast, Y1250F,Y1251F substitutions did not reduce but could actually augment the receptor-mediated mitogenic response to IGF-1. In contrast to mitogenicity, clonogenicity in semi-solid agar (anchorage-independent growth), which increased 7-fold in cells expressing the WT receptor, was abolished in cells expressing IGF-IRY1250F,Y1251F, reduced to control levels in cells expressing IGF-IRY1131F,Y1135F,Y1136 F and partially reduced in cells expressing IGF-IRY1131F (Fig.4). IGF-I can rescue M-27 cells overexpressing the WT receptor from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. We measured apoptosis in cells expressing mutant receptors using annexin V-based immunostaining and flow cytometry. Results in Fig.5 show that Y-F substitutions in either the kinase or C′-terminal domains abolished the ability of the receptor to rescue cells from apoptosis. M-27 cells expressing IGF-IRWT acquire a liver-colonizing potential absent in the parent line. When the cells were transfected with the Y1131F,Y1135F,Y1136F receptor mutant, the increase in the number of experimental liver metastases due to IGF-IR expression was abolished. Y-F substitutions in residues 1250 and 1251 also inhibited metastasis, reducing it by 90% relative to cells transfected with the WT receptor (Fig. 6). Furthermore, when the Y1131F,Y1135F,Y1136F mutant receptor was overexpressed in the highly metastatic H-59 cells, we found that it could act as a dominant negative mutant, significantly reducing the ability of these cells to form liver metastase (Table I and Fig.7).Figure 7An IGF-IR with Y-F substitutions in the kinase domain acts as a dominant negative and inhibits metastases formation. A, H-59 cells overexpressing the WT or mutated receptors were analyzed by the thymidine uptake assay (A) as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Shown are the results of a representative experiment of two performed expressed as means and S.D. of triplicates. These cells were also injected by the intrasplenic/portal route to generate liver metastases (B) using the protocol described in the legend to Fig. 6. Seven mice were injected per group, and all mice developed hepatic metastases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The objective of this study was to gain insight into the role that the IGF-IR plays in the regulation of the malignant/metastatic phenotype by exploring the dependence of different cellular functions that affect metastasis on different domains of the receptor. Cells expressing the triple Y1131F,Y1135F,Y1136F mutant receptor lost all of the IGF-IR- dependent functions measured, and their phenotypes were indistinguishable from, or suppressed relative to, the parent line. A Y1135F substitution had a similar effect whereas a Y1131F mutation reduced IGF-IR-mediated functions only partially. This is in agreement with other reports that identified Tyr-1135 and Tyr-1136 as most critical for the kinase activity of the receptor (13Baserga R. Hongo A."
https://openalex.org/W2043079691,"Stopped-flow tryptophan fluorescence under single turnover and pseudo-first-order conditions has been used to investigate the kinetic mechanism of β-lactam hydrolysis by theStenotrophomonas maltophilia L1 metallo-β-lactamase. For the cephalosporin substrates nitrocefin and cefaclor and the carbapenem meropenem, a substantial quench of fluorescence is observed on association of substrate with enzyme. We have assigned this to a rearrangement event subsequent to formation of an initial collision complex. For the colorimetric compound nitrocefin, decay of this dark inter- mediate represents the overall rate-determining step for the reaction and is equivalent to decay of a previously observed state in which the β-lactam amide bond has already been cleaved. For both cefaclor and meropenem, the rate-determining step for hydrolysis is loss of a second, less quenched state, in which, however, the β-lactam amide bond remains intact. We suggest, therefore, that the mechanism of hydrolysis of nitrocefin by binuclear metallo-β-lactamases may be atypical and that cleavage of the β-lactam amide bond is the rate-determining step for breakdown of the majority of β-lactam substrates by the L1 enzyme.

Zinc-dependent or metallo-β-lactamases (1Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27 Suppl. 1: S48-S53Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) are bacterial enzymes of considerable clinical and mechanistic interest. In the clinical context, their ability to hydrolyze the newer generation of carbapenem antibiotics (2Livermore D.M. Woodford N. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), together with the potential for interspecies transfer arising from their presence on mobile genetic elements (3Ito H.Y.

The group includes both nonspecific enzymes (able to efficiently hydrolyze penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics in addition to carbapenems) and specific enzymes (5Felici A. Amicosante G.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although mechanistic analogies with zinc peptidases have been attempted (7Paul-Soto R. Bauer R. Frère J.-M. Galleni M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H. Rossolini G.M. de Seny D. Hernandez-Valladares M. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), it is now clear that metallo-β-lactamases are members of a distinct superfamily of hydrolases that includes bacterial arylsulfatases and type II glyoxalases (8Fast W. Wang Z. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Carfi A. Pares S. Duée E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frère J.-M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Despite increasing attention in recent years (10Neuwald A.F. Liu J.S. Lipman D.J. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1665-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 11Melino S. Capo C. Dragani B. Aceto A. Petruzelli R. Trends Biochem.

J. 1998; 331: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), understanding of metallo-β-lactamase mechanism remains incomplete, and there are to date no clinically effective inhibitors.There is general agreement that metallo-β-lactamases hydrolyze substrate by a nucleophilic attack of zinc-bound water upon the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond (Ref. 13Wang Z. Fast W. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10013-10023Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar and references therein). This would be expected to lead to formation of a tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate that would decay to product via cleavage of the β-lactam amide bond and protonation of the amide nitrogen. Several models of such a reaction scheme have been postulated (7Paul-Soto R. Bauer R. Frère J.-M. Galleni M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H. Rossolini G.M. de Seny D. Hernandez-Valladares M.

Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar); these vary primarily in the source of the proton required for product formation. Experimental evidence points to different conclusions for different enzymes: in the BCII enzyme from Bacillus cereus, a conserved aspartate in the active site appears to shuttle a proton from the oxyanion to the amide nitrogen, and the major intermediate is a dianionic species (10Neuwald A.F. Liu J.S. Lipman D.J. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1665-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), whereas in CcrA from Bacteriodes fragilis, the major intermediate in hydrolysis of the colorimetric β-lactam nitrocefin is the deprotonated product, and the rate-determining step is donation of a proton by a second zinc-bound water (11Melino S. Capo C. Dragani B. Aceto A. Petruzelli R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 381-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This apparent mechanistic heterogeneity between different metallo-β-lactamases is also manifest in the results of attempts at inhibitor design (16Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O.

Felici A. Galleni M. Paul-Soto R. Adlinngton R.M. Baldwin J.E. Frère J.-M. Golobolov M. Schofield C.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 2455-2458Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although associated primarily with respiratory infections, it has been identified in a wide variety of bacteremias and can be a significant cause of mortality. It is intrinsically resistant to a wide range of antibiotics and in clinical strains may possess additional high level multidrug resistance (21Nagano R. Adachi Y. Imamura H. Yamada K. Hashizume T. Morishima H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2497-2503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance of this organism to a wide range of β-lactam antibiotics is due primarily to expression of a pair of chromosomal β-lactamases, a class A active-site serine enzyme L2 (22Quinn J.P. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27 Suppl. 1: S117-S124Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and a metallo-β-lactamase L1 (23Vartivarian S.E. Anaissie E. Bodey G. Sprigg H. Rolston K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The L1 enzyme is the prototypical member of a distinct subclass (B3) of metallo-β-lactamases that diverge markedly in sequence from the better characterized enzymes, such as BCII and CcrA (24Walsh T.R. MacGowan A.P. Bennett P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1460-1464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Walsh T.R. Hall L. Assinder S.J. Nichols W.W. Cartwright S.J. MacGowan A.P. Bennett P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The structure of L1 (15Wang Z. Fast W. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) confirms that it shares the αβ/βα sandwich fold characteristic of the superfamily and has a binuclear zinc site, but the structure also reveals an active site geometry that is considerably at variance with those of the BCII, CcrA, andPseudomonas aeruginosa IMP-1 enzymes. L1 is unique among known metallo-β-lactamases in that it exists in solution as a compact tetramer whereas all the other enzymes appear to be monomeric. L1 hydrolyzes a wide range of penicillin, cephalosporin, and carbapenem substrates.We have previously proposed (15Wang Z. Fast W. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) that L1 hydrolyzes substrate through a tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate; however, pre-steady-state kinetic experiments using nitrocefin as substrate (12Bounaga S. Laws A.P. Galleni M. Page M.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) show that the major intermediate has the same characteristics as that observed for the CcrA enzyme (11Melino S. Capo C. Dragani B. Aceto A. Petruzelli R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 381-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nitrocefin (Fig. 1) differs from the majority of β-lactams in that it bears a dinitrostyryl substituent on the cephalosporin nucleus that may serve to selectively stabilize this state (26Ambler R.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. B Biol. Sci. 1980; 289: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are almost no reported pre-steady-state data for hydrolysis of therapeutic β-lactams by any metallo-β-lactamase (27Bush K. Jacoby B. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 28O'Callaghan C.H. Morris A. Kirby S.M. Shingler A.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 1: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Accordingly, as part of an ongoing investigation into the structure, mechanism, and regulation of theS. maltophilia L1 enzyme, we have sought to examine the hydrolysis by L1 of a range of β-lactam substrates using pre-steady-state kinetics in conjunction with UV absorbance and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results confirm the presence of the previously reported intermediate in nitrocefin hydrolysis, confirm that the rate-determining step in this process occurs after C–N bond cleavage, and show that tryptophan fluorescence of L1 is a suitable probe for investigating conformational changes of the enzyme during turnover of substrates. However, with the alternative substrates cefaclor (cephalosporin) and meropenem (carbapenem), we observe that the rate-determining step is coincident with loss of substrate UV absorbance. We therefore propose that this corresponds to opening of the C–N bond and thus that the major populated intermediate is not equivalent to that observed in the nitrocefin case. Breakdown of these substrates also involves additional processes prior to the rate-determining step that may be resolved by stopped-flow fluorescence experiments under pseudo-first-order conditions. We present here a kinetic mechanism for hydrolysis of these β-lactams by the L1 enzyme. This suggests that the mechanism by which L1 hydrolyzes nitrocefin may be atypical and that for the majority of β-lactam substrates, populated intermediates possess an intact β-lactam amide bond the cleavage of which corresponds with the rate-determining step for the reaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESS. maltophilia L1 was expressed and purified as previously described (15Wang Z. Fast W. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 29Bicknell R. Waley S.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6876-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nitrocefin was purchased from Becton Dickinson. Cefaclor was purchased from Sigma. Meropenem was purchased from AstraZeneca. Substrate concentrations were determined from measured absorbance changes on complete hydrolysis using extinction coefficients and wavelengths given by Crowder et. al. (29Bicknell R. Waley S.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6876-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or BDH. Steady-state experiments were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lamda 2 UV-VIS spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cell holder and circulating water bath to maintain temperature at 10 °C. Stopped-flow experiments were performed on anApplied Photophysics SX18MV apparatus equipped with a constant temperature circulating water bath. The path length of the observation cell was 0.2 cm, and both excitation and emission slits were maintained at 4 mm. Fluorescence data were collected using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and a WG320 nm cut-on filter on the emission photomultiplier. The photomultiplier input was adjusted for each protein concentration to maintain a total signal change of 1V between protein in the absence of substrate and dark current readings. Data were recorded as photomultiplier output in volts. For absorbance experiments, data were recorded as absorbance units, with photomultiplier input first adjusted to give a reading of 0 for buffer only at each wavelength used. All experiments were performed in 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm zinc chloride. Individual transients were averaged and fitted using the nonlinear least-squares algorithms contained in theApplied Photophysics software or in the program Grafit (30Bicknell R. Schffer A. Waley S.G. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7208-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Single turnover progress curves were fitted using the numerical integration algorithm implemented in the FACSIMILE package (31Crowder M.W. Walsh T.R. Banovic L. Pettit M. Spencer J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 921-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Residue numbers referred to under “Discussion” are given according to the proposed standard numbering scheme for metallo-β-lactamases (32Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1994Google Scholar).RESULTSWe initially investigated the utility of tryptophan fluorescence as a probe for events during hydrolysis of the synthetic cephalosporin nitrocefin by the L1 enzyme. Nitrocefin (26Ambler R.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. B Biol. Sci. 1980; 289: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) has been extensively used in mechanistic investigations of metallo-β-lactamase action (11Melino S. Capo C. Dragani B. Aceto A. Petruzelli R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 381-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Bounaga S. Laws A.P. Galleni M. Page M.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,27Bush K. Jacoby B. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar), as both the loss of substrate and appearance of product are accompanied by substantial changes in absorbance (λmax∼390 and 482 nm, respectively). It has further been shown that nitrocefin hydrolysis by L1 proceeds through a transiently populated intermediate with a strong absorbance at 665 nm, the breakdown of which coincides with appearance of product (12Bounaga S. Laws A.P. Galleni M. Page M.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Accordingly, single turnover experiments were performed in which 25 μm L1 was mixed with 25 μm nitrocefin at 25 °C, and the reaction was monitored using tryptophan fluorescence and absorbance at all three wavelengths. The results are shown in Fig.2. Tryptophan fluorescence reports a biphasic transient in which a rapid and substantial quench of fluorescence is followed by a regain to baseline levels. The overall time course may be well described by fitting to two exponentials the rates of which (Table I) are broadly consistent with those reported both by monitoring absorbance at 390 nm (substrate) and at 665 nm (intermediate) when these traces are fitted to a biexponential decay. (The low amplitude regain of absorbance at 390 nm we ascribe to formation of product from intermediate. Such a signal would arise from the slight overlap of product with substrate spectra compared with the negligible overlap of substrate and intermediate.) The rate of regain of fluorescence (TableI, k2) is further consistent with the rate of appearance of product (obtained by fitting a single exponential to the progress curve at 482 nm) and may therefore be confidently assigned to the rate-determining step of the reaction. We consider the possibility that a substantial proportion of the fluorescence signal arises from inner filter effects due to the absorbance of nitrocefin at 295 nm unlikely, as the change is from high to low to high fluorescence. Absorbance events recorded at 295 nm are equivalent to those at 390 nm (large loss followed by small regain; data not shown) and would in this case be expected to result in an increase in intensity of exciting light and of fluorescence as the first event. We therefore conclude that tryptophan fluorescence is a valid method for study of nitrocefin hydrolysis by L1 and that it reports the same events (formation and decay of intermediate) as the absorbance signals at 390 and 665 nm.Figure 2Single turnover hydrolysis of 25 μm nitrocefin by 25 μm S. maltophilia L1 at 25 °C.

These and subsequent experiments were performed at 10 °C in an attempt to extend the range of substrate concentrations over which these rates could be measured. All of the data were well described by a single exponential process. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 3. It is apparent that the concentration dependence of the rate of fluorescence quenching is nonlinear, although the rate of reaction at 100 μm substrate is approaching the limit of time resolution of the stopped-flow apparatus employed and precludes further data collection to accurately determine the rate at which this process ultimately saturates. Data were therefore fitted to a saturation equation of the following form,kobs={(kf·[S])/(K+[S])}+kr(Scheme1)where kobs is the observed rate;kf and kr are forward and reverse rate constants, respectively; and K is the dissociation constant for the preceding step. As this fit yielded a negative value for kr , kr was set at 0, giving figures for kf of 1790 ± 215 s−1 and for K of 146 ± 26 μm.Figure 3Plot of observed rate constant (kobs, s–1) against nitrocefin concentration (μm) for fluorescence quenching rate (approach to steady-state) on hydrolysis by 0.5 μm S. maltophiliaL1 under pseudo-first-order conditions at 10 °C.

The results are shown in Fig.4 a. The data were fitted to two exponentials as above, giving a rate for turnover (regain of fluorescence) of 12.6 s−1. This data set was then reduced and imported into the FACSIMILE package for fitting to the reaction scheme,E+S⇋k2k1ES⇋k4k3EI1→k5E+P(Scheme2)in which the collision rate k1 was set to 1 × 108m−1s−1, and experimentally determined values of K, kf , and turnover (above) were used to define starting points for k2,k3, and k5, respectively.k4 was set at 0. The fluorescence yields of the different states were varied such that EI1 was assigned as the quenched state and E and ES to be of equal fluorescence. The results (Fig. 4 a and TableII) demonstrate that a good fit to the data may be obtained from this simple reaction scheme, representing the minimum necessary to accommodate both the observations presented here and those reported by McManus-Munoz and Crowder (12Bounaga S. Laws A.P. Galleni M. Page M.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Varying different combinations of the different rate constants suggested that the dissociation rate constant for the ES complex (k2) is essentially undefined by the single turnover data and confirmed that generation of EI1 from ES is irreversible (k4 → 0). Thus,k2 was fixed at 1.46 × 104s−1 and k4 at 0 s−1. Some movement in k3 is required for optimal fitting; however, this rate is defined by only a relatively small number of points in the single turnover data set, and its definition by the pseudo-first-order data must be considered approximate, as it was impossible to measure this rate under fully saturating conditions. Our results using tryptophan fluorescence therefore confirm the minimal kinetic mechanism for L1-catalyzed nitrocefin hydrolysis reported by McManus-Munoz and Crowder (12Bounaga S. Laws A.P. Galleni M. Page M.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) using absorbance measurements. Using our fitted values to calculate kcat(kcat =k3·k5/(k3+ k5)) and Km (Km = (k2·k5 +k3·k5)/(k1·k3+ k1·k5)) yields values in good agreement both with the results of steady-state experiments at 10 °C and with previously reported values measured at 25 °C, where rate constants might be expected to be 1.5–2 times greater (see Table V).Figure 4Single turnover hydrolysis by 20 μm S. maltophilia L1 at 10 °C of the following: A, 5 μm nitrocefin followed by tryptophan fluorescence; B, 15 μm cefaclor followed by absorbance at 265 nm (left y axis) and tryptophan fluorescence (right y axis); or C, 15 μmmeropenem followed by absorbance at 297 nm (left y axis) and tryptophan fluorescence (right y axis).

Open table in a new tab The data obtained with nitrocefin thus suggest that tryptophan fluorescence of L1 could be a useful optical probe with which events in β-lactam hydrolysis might be followed. Accordingly a range of additional substrates was tested under single turnover conditions in order to identify those for which the complete hydrolysis reaction could be followed. All substrates tested (azlocillin, benzylpenicillin, cefaclor, and meropenem) produced qualitatively similar progress curves in which a rapid quench of fluorescence was followed by a rate-determining regain. Unfortunately, however, for both penicillins, the quenching process occurred within the dead time of the stopped-flow even at 10 °C. For meropenem and cefaclor, however, both quenching and regain rates were accessible. Fig. 4, b andc, shows the results of single turnover experiments in which 20 μm L1 was mixed with 15 μm substrate at 10 °C, and the reaction was followed using both tryptophan fluorescence and the absorbance signal of the β-lactam amide bond. When the data are fitted (to a single exponential in the case of the absorbance and a double exponential for the fluorescence traces), it is apparent in both cases that the rate of regain of fluorescence (34 and 10 s−1 for meropenem and cefaclor, respectively) is the same as that reported by the loss of absorbance (32 and 9.1 s−1). Because the major contributor to absorbance of β-lactams that lack aromatic substituents (such as cefaclor and meropenem) is the amide bond (26Ambler R.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. B Biol. Sci. 1980; 289: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), we conclude that in these cases, the rate-determining step in hydrolysis is likely to be breakdown of the β-lactam bond.In order to collect additional information about steps preceding this rate-determining step, the initial quenching of tryptophan fluorescence was examined under pseudo-first-order conditions as described above. At low substrate concentrations, the data for cefaclor are well described by a single exponential. In the case of meropenem, the absorbance change at 295 nm on hydrolysis of substrate is not negligible, and data were accordingly fitted using a linear phase in addition to exponential terms. Control experiments demonstrated that the change in absorbance at 295 nm is linear and that there are n"

There is now evidence for a potential role of ROS in acute neurological events, such as ischemia, anoxia and reperfusion injury, and chronic neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease (1Behl C. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), Parkinson's disease (2Fahn S. Cohen G. Ann.

Neuroendocrinology. 1999; 69: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which free radical-induced neurodegeneration occurs is not known and remains a subject of controversy; some groups report features of necrosis (4Richter-Landsberg C.

Apoptotic cells are characterized by condensed and fragmented nuclei, whereas necrotic cells present loss of membrane integrity without apparent nuclear damage. Apoptosis is also characterized by the activation of specific cysteinyl proteases (caspases), which have been shown to be ROS-activated in several models (7Turner N.A. Xia F. Azhar G. Zhang X. Liu L. Wei J.Y. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1789-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Matsura T. Kai M. Fujii Y. Ito H. Yamada K. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).Calpains represent another group of cysteinyl proteases. Their up-regulation by oxidative stress has recently been demonstrated in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (11Ray S.K. Fidan M. Nowak M.W. Wilford G.G. Hogan E.L. Banik N.L. Brain Res. 2000; 852: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and in the mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cell line (12Ishihara I. Minami Y. Nishizaki T. Matsuoka T. Yamamura H. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 279: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Calpain is one of the most abundant neutral proteinases in the central nervous system and occurs as a proenzyme in association with its endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin. Two forms of calpains, microcalpain (μ-calpain) and millicalpain (m-calpain), are expressed ubiquitously in animal tissues. Calpain expression is increased in neuropathological processes, including Alzheimer's (13Saito K. Elce J.S. Hamos J.E. Nixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2628-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and Parkinson's (14Mouatt-Prigent A. Karlsson J.O. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) diseases, suggesting involvement of this protease in neuronal stress responses.Oxidative stress induces rapid increases in [Ca2+]i by stimulating Ca2+ influx from the extracellular environment and efflux from intracellular stores (15Putney Jr., J.W. Science. 1993; 262: 676-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), thereby probably leading to calpain activation. These Ca2+ fluxes may also elicit the activity of other enzymes such as calcineurin. The latter, also called protein phosphatase 2B, belongs to the family of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatases. Calcineurin, a heterodimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit (17Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar) has been implicated in neuronal death. In fact, calcineurin is highly expressed in the central nervous system, especially in neurons vulnerable to ischemic and traumatic insult (for a review, see Ref. 18Morioka M. Hamada J. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Glutamate-induced early necrosis and delayed apoptosis in cerebellar granule cells (CGC) can be blocked by calcineurin inhibitors (19Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Orrenius S. Nicotera P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively activated calcineurin mutant induces cytochromec/caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in neurons (20Asai A. Qiu J. Narita Y. Chi S. Saito N. Shinoura N. Hamada H. Kuchino Y. Kirino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34450-34458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).The aim of the present study was to investigate the interactions between oxidative stress signaling and neurotrophic pathways in CGC. We previously demonstrated the antiapoptotic role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) in these neurons (21See V. Boutillier A.L. Bito H. Loeffler J.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CaMKIV is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates a large variety of substrates and is implicated in the control of gene transcription because of its ability to phosphorylate several transcription factors (22Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 23Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E.

Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). CaMKIV is expressed in cerebellar granule neurons (for a review, see Refs. 25Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar and 26Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and is activated under depolarizing conditions (high extracellular potassium (HK): [K+] = 30 mm). CaMKIV mediates HK-induced CGC survival by phosphorylating CREB. Several reports have indicated that both CaMKIV activity (27Anderson K.A. Ribar T.J. Illario M. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 (pCREB) (28Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1836-1842PubMed Google Scholar) are involved in cell survival. We show here that oxidative stress induces a caspase-independent but calpain-dependent cleavage of CaMKIV and one of its nuclear targets, CREB. We also show that the levels of CaMKIV and CREB, but not those of pCREB, can be restored by treatment with calpain inhibitors, indicating the recruitment of an active dephosphorylating mechanism. Further, we demonstrate that co-treatment with calpain and serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors reinstates pCREB levels and reverses ROS-induced neuronal death. Last, we show that pCREB is itself able to promote neuronal survival under conditions of oxidative stress. This work represents the first demonstration of a dual control of neuronal death by proteolytic and dephosphorylation mechanisms.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CulturesCerebellar granule neurons were cultured as previously described (30Schousboe A. Meier E. Drejer J. Hertz L. Shahar A. de Vellis J. Vernadakis A. Haber B. A Dissection and Culture Manual for the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 203-206Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebella from 7-day-old mice (fvb strain) were dissected and dissociated using trypsin (Sigma) and mechanical trituration, the resulting cell suspension being grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 30 mmKCl, insulin (0.5 μm), and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). After 2 days in culture, neurons were switched to a serum-free defined medium, HK (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 30 mmKCl, insulin (0.5 μm), gentamycin (50 μg/ml), T3 (1 nm), putrescin (60 μm), transferrin (100 μm), and sodium selenite (30 nm)), and experiments were performed 5 days later. In some instances, medium containing low potassium (LK; 5 mm KCl) was used. When used, H2O2 was added to HK medium.Reagents and AntibodiesPeptidergic calpain inhibitors (calpain inhibitor I (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO) and calpain inhibitor II (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-CHO) and caspase substrate (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC)) were purchased from Calbiochem. H2O2 was purchased from Sigma; phosphatases inhibitors (microcystin-LR and cyclosporin A) were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA).The following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-CaMKIV (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), rabbit polyclonal anti-p20 active CPP32 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), rabbit polyclonals anti-P-CREB and anti-N-CREB (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG, and sheep anti-mouse IgG (Pierce).Colorimetric MTT AssayCells were cultured in 96-well culture dishes (Costar) and treated as indicated. Following treatment, mitochondrial activity (MTT) was assayed using a slight modification of the method described by Mossmann (31Mossmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45461) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were incubated for 1 h (37 °C) with freshly prepared culture medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma). After aspiration of the medium, the dark blue crystals formed were dissolved by adding 100 μl/well of 0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol. Plates were shaken at room temperature to ensure that all crystals were dissolved before taking absorbance readings on a Metertech S960 MicroELISA plate reader (test wavelength, 490 nm; nonspecific wavelength, 650 nm). Results are presented as a percentage of survival, taking control as 100%. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using Graphpad Instat 2 software. Significant differences were assessed by means of analysis of variance, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons.DNA LadderingCerebellar neurons cultured in 10-cm diameter plates were either treated with a pulse of 100 μmH2O2 (15 min) or switched to LK medium. After the indicated times of culture, cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm EDTA and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 15 min on ice. Centrifugation at 15,000 rpm eliminated cell debris and genomic DNA. The supernatant was incubated (1 h at 45 °C) with an equal volume of a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 200 μg/ml Proteinase K, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 40 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. After a phenol/chloroform (v/v) treatment, the upper phase was precipitated with ethanol and analyzed on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of RNase A (1 μg/ml).Western Blot AnalysisForty μg of total cell extract in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad; 0.45 μm). Nonspecific labeling was blocked in 10% blotto (10% nonfat dry milk, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, and membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in 3% blotto. After three washes (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated whole sheep antibody (1:2000) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000). After three washes, specific bands were detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were exposed for the indicated periods of time to BIOMAX-MR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). All Western blot analyses were performed at least three times.Hoechst StainingCondensed and fragmented nuclei were evaluated in situ by intercalation of the fluorescent probe bisbenzimide, Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) into nuclear DNA (32Brugg B. Michel P.P. Agid Y. Ruberg M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (30 min), cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) for 45 min at room temperature. Hoechst 33342, which is cell-permeant and labels both intact and apoptotic nuclei, was visualized with an AMCA filter (excitation, 350 nm; emission, 450 nm). The nuclear surface sizes were assessed using the NIH Image Software. Nuclei were considered to be condensed if their surface area was at least 25% surface lower than that of the mean found for control cells. Nuclei showing distinct fragmentation were considered to be “fragmented nuclei.” The percentage of condensed and fragmented nuclei in each treatment condition was computed from cell counts in at least five randomly chosen fields (40× objective).Measurement of Caspase-3 ActivityCaspase-3 activity was determined by measuring the release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) from the caspase tetrapeptide CPP32 substrate DEVD-AMC (Calbiochem), as previously described (33Przywara D.A. Kulkarni J.S. Wakade T.D. Leontiev D.V. Wakade A.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons grown in 30-mm culture dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% Igepal NP-4 (Sigma), 0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) on ice. One portion of the lysate was used for protein determination (Bradford method; Bio-Rad), and 50 μl of lysate were added to a reaction mixture containing 100 μl of 2× reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol), 40 μl of H2O, and 10 μl of DEVD-AMC (final concentration 50 μm) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by a 10× dilution with ice-cold lysis buffer. Fluorescence of free AMC was measured (excitation and emission wavelengths: 360 and 465 nm, respectively), using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences HTS 7000 Bioassay Reader.TransfectionsExpression VectorspSV2-CREB-VP16 (a generous gift from C. Bancroft, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York) encodes a chimera protein where CREB-(1–341) is fused to the transcription activator region of VP16 and thus generates constitutively active CREB protein (34Yan G. Chen X. Bancroft C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 101: R25-R30Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). CREB M1 was kindly provided by J. R. Lundblad (Vollum Institute, Portland, OR) This plasmid encodes a phosphorylation-deficient CREB protein mutated on serine 133 (changed to alanine) and has been reported as a dominant inhibitory mutant of CREB (35Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Leonard J. Fischer W.H. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).Gene TransferNeuronal gene transfer was performed as reported previously, using polyethyleneimine (25 kDa) as DNA carrier (36Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Sherman D. Demeinex B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5569) Google Scholar). After 3 days in vitro, cell cultures on glass coverslips, placed in 12-well plates, were transfected for 30 min with 0.75 μg/ml of expression vector and 0.75 μg/ml of EGFP-expression vector (CLONTECH). Plates were spun for 5 min at 1500 rpm. Twenty-four h after transfection and recovery in HK, cells were transferred to LK for 10 h or treated with a pulse of H2O2 for 8 h. Apoptotic nuclei were visualized by Hoechst 33342 staining, and transfected cells were visualized by EGFP fluorescence. Oxidative stress refers to the cytotoxic consequences of exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS).1 The latter are generated as by-products of normal and aberrant metabolic processes that utilize molecular oxygen. There is now evidence for a potential role of ROS in acute neurological events, such as ischemia, anoxia and reperfusion injury, and chronic neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease (1Behl C. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), Parkinson's disease (2Fahn S. Cohen G. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (3Lutz-Bucher B. Gonzalez de Aguilar J.L. Rene F. See V. Gordon J.W. Loeffler J. Neuroendocrinology. 1999; 69: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which free radical-induced neurodegeneration occurs is not known and remains a subject of controversy; some groups report features of necrosis (4Richter-Landsberg C. Vollgraf U. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 5Hill I.E. Murray C. Richard J. Rasquinha I. MacManus J.P. Exp.

Res. 2000; 41: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells are characterized by condensed and fragmented nuclei, whereas necrotic cells present loss of membrane integrity without apparent nuclear damage. Apoptosis is also characterized by the activation of specific cysteinyl proteases (caspases), which have been shown to be ROS-activated in several models (7Turner N.A. Xia F. Azhar G. Zhang X. Liu L. Wei J.Y. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1789-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Matsura T. Kai M. Fujii Y. Ito H. Yamada K. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 30: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Calpains represent another group of cysteinyl proteases. Their up-regulation by oxidative stress has recently been demonstrated in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (11Ray S.K. Fidan M. Nowak M.W. Wilford G.G. Hogan E.L. Banik N.L. Brain Res. 2000; 852: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and in the mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cell line (12Ishihara I. Minami Y. Nishizaki T. Matsuoka T. Yamamura H. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 279: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Calpain is one of the most abundant neutral proteinases in the central nervous system and occurs as a proenzyme in association with its endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin. Two forms of calpains, microcalpain (μ-calpain) and millicalpain (m-calpain), are expressed ubiquitously in animal tissues. Calpain expression is increased in neuropathological processes, including Alzheimer's (13Saito K. Elce J.S. Hamos J.E. Nixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2628-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and Parkinson's (14Mouatt-Prigent A. Karlsson J.O. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) diseases, suggesting involvement of this protease in neuronal stress responses. Oxidative stress induces rapid increases in [Ca2+]i by stimulating Ca2+ influx from the extracellular environment and efflux from intracellular stores (15Putney Jr., J.W. Science. 1993; 262: 676-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), thereby probably leading to calpain activation. These Ca2+ fluxes may also elicit the activity of other enzymes such as calcineurin. The latter, also called protein phosphatase 2B, belongs to the family of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatases. Calcineurin, a heterodimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit (17Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar) has been implicated in neuronal death. In fact, calcineurin is highly expressed in the central nervous system, especially in neurons vulnerable to ischemic and traumatic insult (for a review, see Ref. 18Morioka M. Hamada J. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Glutamate-induced early necrosis and delayed apoptosis in cerebellar granule cells (CGC) can be blocked by calcineurin inhibitors (19Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Orrenius S. Nicotera P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively activated calcineurin mutant induces cytochromec/caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in neurons (20Asai A. Qiu J. Narita Y. Chi S. Saito N. Shinoura N. Hamada H. Kuchino Y. Kirino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34450-34458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate the interactions between oxidative stress signaling and neurotrophic pathways in CGC. We previously demonstrated the antiapoptotic role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) in these neurons (21See V. Boutillier A.L. Bito H. Loeffler J.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CaMKIV is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates a large variety of substrates and is implicated in the control of gene transcription because of its ability to phosphorylate several transcription factors (22Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 23Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E.

Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). CaMKIV is expressed in cerebellar granule neurons (for a review, see Refs. 25Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar and 26Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and is activated under depolarizing conditions (high extracellular potassium (HK): [K+] = 30 mm). CaMKIV mediates HK-induced CGC survival by phosphorylating CREB. Several reports have indicated that both CaMKIV activity (27Anderson K.A. Ribar T.J. Illario M. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 (pCREB) (28Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2358-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 29Walton M. Woodgate A.M. Muravlev A. Xu R. During M.J. Dragunow M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1836-1842PubMed Google Scholar) are involved in cell survival. We show here that oxidative stress induces a caspase-independent but calpain-dependent cleavage of CaMKIV and one of its nuclear targets, CREB. We also show that the levels of CaMKIV and CREB, but not those of pCREB, can be restored by treatment with calpain inhibitors, indicating the recruitment of an active dephosphorylating mechanism. Further, we demonstrate that co-treatment with calpain and serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors reinstates pCREB levels and reverses ROS-induced neuronal death. Last, we show that pCREB is itself able to promote neuronal survival under conditions of oxidative stress. This work represents the first demonstration of a dual control of neuronal death by proteolytic and dephosphorylation mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CulturesCerebellar granule neurons were cultured as previously described (30Schousboe A. Meier E. Drejer J. Hertz L. Shahar A. de Vellis J. Vernadakis A. Haber B. A Dissection and Culture Manual for the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 203-206Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebella from 7-day-old mice (fvb strain) were dissected and dissociated using trypsin (Sigma) and mechanical trituration, the resulting cell suspension being grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 30 mmKCl, insulin (0.5 μm), and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). After 2 days in culture, neurons were switched to a serum-free defined medium, HK (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 30 mmKCl, insulin (0.5 μm), gentamycin (50 μg/ml), T3 (1 nm), putrescin (60 μm), transferrin (100 μm), and sodium selenite (30 nm)), and experiments were performed 5 days later. In some instances, medium containing low potassium (LK; 5 mm KCl) was used. When used, H2O2 was added to HK medium.Reagents and AntibodiesPeptidergic calpain inhibitors (calpain inhibitor I (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO) and calpain inhibitor II (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-CHO) and caspase substrate (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC)) were purchased from Calbiochem. H2O2 was purchased from Sigma; phosphatases inhibitors (microcystin-LR and cyclosporin A) were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA).The following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-CaMKIV (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), rabbit polyclonal anti-p20 active CPP32 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), rabbit polyclonals anti-P-CREB and anti-N-CREB (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG, and sheep anti-mouse IgG (Pierce).Colorimetric MTT AssayCells were cultured in 96-well culture dishes (Costar) and treated as indicated. Following treatment, mitochondrial activity (MTT) was assayed using a slight modification of the method described by Mossmann (31Mossmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45461) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were incubated for 1 h (37 °C) with freshly prepared culture medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma). After aspiration of the medium, the dark blue crystals formed were dissolved by adding 100 μl/well of 0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol. Plates were shaken at room temperature to ensure that all crystals were dissolved before taking absorbance readings on a Metertech S960 MicroELISA plate reader (test wavelength, 490 nm; nonspecific wavelength, 650 nm). Results are presented as a percentage of survival, taking control as 100%. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using Graphpad Instat 2 software. Signi"
https://openalex.org/W1967255711,"The mammalian transcription factor GATA-1 is required for normal erythroid and megakaryocytic development. GATA-1 contains two zinc fingers, the C-terminal finger, which is known to bind (A/T)GATA(A/G) motifs in DNA and the N-finger, which is important for interacting with co-regulatory proteins such as Friend of GATA (FOG). We now show that, like the C-finger, the N-finger of GATA-1 is also capable of binding DNA but recognizes distinct sequences with the core GATC. We demonstrate that the GATA-1 N-finger can bind these sequences in vitro and that in cellular assays, GATA-1 can activate promoters containing GATC motifs. Experiments with mutant GATA-1 proteins confirm the importance of the N-finger, as the C-finger is not required for transactivation from GATC sites. Recently four naturally occurring mutations in GATA-1 have been shown to be associated with familial blood disorders. These mutations all map to the N-finger domain. We have investigated the effect of these mutations on the recognition of GATC sites by the N-finger and show that one mutation R216Q abolishes DNA binding, whereas the others have only minor effects.

Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar,2Lowry J.A. Atchley W.R. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The defining feature of the family is the presence of one or two GATA-type zinc fingers. GATA-type fingers contain four cysteine residues that coordinate a single zinc ion (3Teakle G.R. Gilmartin P.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 100-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cysteines are arranged with a characteristic CX 2CX 17CX 2C spacing, and the fingers share a number of additional residues, such that the consensus sequence is CXNCX 4TPLWRRX 7CNACGLYXK. GATA proteins from lower organisms (such as yeast) usually have a single GATA-type finger, whereas GATA proteins from higher organisms typically have two fingers, termed the N-terminal and the C-terminal zinc fingers. Six highly related GATA family proteins have been identified in mammals, and all contain two zinc fingers (1Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). The most extensively studied member of the family is GATA-1 (4Tsai S.F. Martin D.I. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). This protein is present at high levels in hematopoietic cells, primarily in erythroid cells, mast cells, and megakaryocytes and is known to bind recognition elements in the control regions of genes expressed in these lineages (1Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1 recognizes sequences of the form (A/T)GATA(A/G) and mutation or deletion of the C-finger prevents binding to these sites (5Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Experiments have demonstrated that the N-finger does not recognize these DNA elements- instead it is instrumental in recruiting co-regulatory proteins, such as Friend of GATA (FOG)1 (6Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y., Yu, C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Thus a general picture has emerged that regulation of gene expression by GATA-1 depends on DNA-binding mediated by the C-finger of GATA-1, and recruitment of various cofactors by the N-finger (or additional domains within GATA-1, including the C-finger). Recent evidence suggests that the situation is more complex. The solution structure of the chicken GATA-1 C-finger bound to an AGATAA site in DNA has been solved by NMR spectroscopy, and the residues that directly contact DNA have been identified (Ref. 7Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar and Figs. 1 and 9). Interestingly, many of these DNA-contact residues are conserved in the N-terminal finger of chicken GATA-1 and also in mammalian GATA-1 N-fingers (2Lowry J.A. Atchley W.R. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 5Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Moreover, although it has been reported that the chicken GATA-1 N-finger does not bind DNA in isolation, it does play a subsidiary role in DNA binding, particularly in stabilizing binding to a small class of promoters that contain double GATA motifs (8Pedone P.V. Omichinski J.G. Nony P. Trainor C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2874-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These results suggested that GATA N-fingers from various organisms can contact DNA and raised the possibility that the N-fingers of the mammalian GATA-1 proteins might have a more important role in DNA recognition than had previously been demonstrated.Figure 9Comparison of the structures of the C-finger and the N-finger of GATA-1. A, a ribbon diagram of the C-finger of chicken GATA-1 bound to DNA (7Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M.

B, a similarly orientated model of the N-finger is presented with the FOG contact residues shown in red and the residues altered by mutation in individuals affected by familial anaemia and thrombocytopenia (V205, G208, R216, and D218) labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Accordingly, we have investigated whether the murine GATA-1 N-finger is capable of functioning as an independent, sequence-specific DNA-binding domain. We demonstrate here that the N-finger recognizes GATC motifsin vitro. A naturally occurring mutation in GATA-1, R216Q (10Yu C. Raskind W.H. Niakan K.K. Matsushita M. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Orkin S.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 495Google Scholar), abolishes this interaction. We also show that GATA-1 is capable of activating transcription from promoters carrying GATC elements. These results extend the range of genes that may be regulated by GATA-1. They also suggest that the protein may adopt different configurations to bind different target genes. The plasmids pGEX2T/N-finger (200) and pGEX2T/C-finger (249) have been previously described (11Fox A.H. Kowalski K. King G.F. Mackay J.P. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33595-33603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutant derivatives were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using standard methods, either single primer mismatch or overlap polymerase chain reaction, as previously described (11Fox A.H. Kowalski K. King G.F. Mackay J.P. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33595-33603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and mutant oligonucleotide primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used in the reactions. The reporter plasmids (TGATCT)-TATA-luciferase and (TGATAA)-luciferase were constructed by first inserting the β-globin TATA box (GATCTCGA CCTTGGGCATAAAAGTAGGGCAGAGCCCTCTATTGTTACATTT- GCTTA) between theBglII and HindIII sites of the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3 (Promega) and then inserting upstream three copies of double-stranded oligonucleotides with the sequence GTACCTCTCCGGCAACTGATCTGGCAACTGATCTGGCAACTGATCTGGACTCCCTGC and GTACCTCTCCGGCAACTGATAAGGCAACTGATAAGGCAACT- GATAAGGACTCCCTGC for the N-finger TGATCT site and the C-finger TGATAA sites, respectively. The 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2) and platelet factor 4 (PF4) promoters contained residues −300 to +37 (12Kramer M.F. Gunaratne P. Ferreira G.C. Gene. 2000; 247: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and −355 to +19 (13Minami T. Tachibana K. Imanishi T. Doi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) cloned directly upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL3. The oligonucleotides used in the initial gel retardation assays had the sequence TCTCCGGCAACTGATCTGGACTCCCTG with variations around the central GAT core as indicated in Fig. 3. The oligonucleotides corresponding to the l-type pyruvate kinase (l-PK) enhancer (14Lacronique V. Lopez S. Miquerol L. Porteu A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14989-14997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the ALAS2 promoter, and the PF4 promoter had the sequences GGGAGCATGGAGATCATAGCACTCCG, AAGGATGGTCTGATCTCAAAATCGAA, and TGGCTGGCCAGATCTCAAGTACTGT, respectively. pGEX2T/N-finger (200), pGEX2T/C-finger (249) and derivatives were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 and the resulting bacteria grown on Luria Bertani broth at 37 °C. Protein induction was initiated by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 4 h of induction, the bacteria were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was subjected to sonication in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The soluble material was eluted from a glutathione-agarose column. After washing with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, the GST fusion protein was eluted with freshly prepared reduced glutathione (6 mg/ml) in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl. These experiments were performed as previously described (11Fox A.H. Kowalski K. King G.F. Mackay J.P. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33595-33603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Reactions were set up in a total volume of 30 μl, comprising 0.1 pg of 32P-labeled probe, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol. After the addition of between 100 and 500 ng of recombinant protein, the reaction was kept on ice for 20 min and then loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel made up in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. The gel was then subjected to electrophoresis at 15 V/cm at 4 °C for 2 h, dried, and analyzed using a PhosophorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The probes used in the experiments were end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase as previously described (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All cell culture manipulations were carried out using standard techniques. Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of the reporter construct, and 100 ng or 250 ng of the wild-type and mutant GATA-1 expression vectors using the calcium phosphate method (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The data are the result of six independent experiments and have been normalized to Renilla luciferase levels derived from co-transfection with the control vector pRL-CMV (Promega). We first prepared recombinant N-finger and C-finger protein as fusions with GST. We also prepared two negative control variants: mutN-finger, carrying a cysteine to alanine substitution at residue 204; and mutC-finger, carrying the equivalent substitution at residue 258. Cysteines 204 and 258 are required for chelation of the zinc ion (in the N- and C-finger respectively), so these mutations prevent the proper folding around zinc. See Figure1 for the sequences of the two domains, details of numbering and an illustration of residues involved in zinc co-ordination, DNA-contact, the interaction with FOG, and substitutions associated with naturally occurring mutations in GATA-1. The four proteins and purified GST alone were tested for their ability to bind a typical (A/T)GATA(A/G) motif, in this case the TGATAA motif from the mouse α-globin promoter (4Tsai S.F. Martin D.I.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, the C-finger protein recognizes the TGATAA site as expected, but the N-finger does not. The C258A mutation in the C-finger that interferes with zinc finger formation prevents binding. Given that the N-finger of chicken GATA-2 (but not chicken GATA-1) has been shown to bind variant GATA sequences (8Pedone P.V. Omichinski J.G. Nony P. Trainor C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2874-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) we tested a panel of GATA-related sequences and found binding to a TGATCT probe. Fig. 2 B shows binding to this variant TGATCT probe. In this case, both the N-finger and the C-finger protein bind this site but binding is not observed with the mutant N-finger or C-finger proteins, or by GST alone. Moreover, sequence specificity is demonstrated by the fact that the N-finger protein binds the TGATCT but not the TGATAA site (compare Fig. 2, A and B). The protein preparations were also examined by Coomassie staining to ensure that comparable amounts were loaded (Fig. 2 C). We next explored the sequence of the N-finger by testing variants of the original TGATCT site. Because the DNA-binding domains of GATA proteins from different organisms are highly conserved and appear to require the central GAT core for recognition (2Lowry J.A. Atchley W.R. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 17Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), we kept these three bases constant but tested variant sites with each of the surrounding bases changed to each of the three other possible bases (Fig. 3). We tested these new sites for binding to the N-finger and for comparison to the C-finger protein. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the N-finger binds the TGATCT site as expected but can also bind related sites such as AGATCT, CGATCT, and GGATCT sites. GGATCG and GGATCA sites are also bound. The other sites are recognized weakly, if at all. Coomassie Blue staining indicates that equal amounts of protein were used in these experiments (Fig. 3B). In summary, the N-finger appears to bind sites with a GATC core. In contrast, the C-finger binds several sites but as expected binds preferentially to the canonical TGATAA site. When combined with previous data on DNA binding by the GATA-1 C-finger (5Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M.

Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 17Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), our results demonstrate that the N- and C-fingers have different preferred sites, with the N-finger favoring a GATC core and the C-finger binding more tightly to probes with a GATA core. The above results show that the isolated GATA-1 N-finger domain is capable of sequence-specific DNA binding in vitro.We next sought to test whether this domain could function in the context of the whole protein and whether it had the ability to bind to GATC motifs and activate transcription in living cells. GATA-1 has been shown to function as a potent transcriptional activator when tested in transient transfection experiments in NIH3T3 cells and is often assayed against synthetic promoters comprising one or several GATA sites upstream of the β-globin TATA box and a suitable reporter gene (5Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). We constructed two reporter constructs, the first containing tandem copies of the TGATCT (or N-finger recognition element) and the second containing tandem copies of the TGATAA (or C-finger recognition element) upstream of the β-globin TATA box and a luciferase reporter gene. We first tested the ability of wild-type GATA-1 to activate these promoters and observed activation of both the promoters (Fig.4, A and B). This result demonstrated that GATA-1 was being localized to both recognition sites and was activating transcription in vivo. We have also confirmed that the double finger domain, comprising intact N- and C-fingers, is capable of binding both the N-finger (TGATCT) site, and the C-finger (TGATAA) site in vitro (data not shown). To test whether the ability of GATA-1 to bind the different recognition sites depended on the N-finger or the C-finger, we next tested the two mutant GATA-1 constructs. The first protein contained an intact N-finger but carried the C258A mutation that disrupts the C-finger, and the second contained an intact C-finger but a mutant N-finger (C204A). As shown by comparing panels A and B in Fig. 4, the protein with an intact N-finger can transactivate the promoter containing the TGATCT (N-finger recognition) site, but not the promoter containing the typical TGATAA (C-finger site). In contrast, the protein with the intact C-finger can activate both promoters. This result is consistent with the observation that the C-finger is capable of binding to both typical C-finger (TGATAA) and N-finger (TGATCT) sites (Fig. 3). We examined the control regions of a number of putative GATA-1 target genes and identified GATC elements in the erythroid l-type pyruvate kinase (l-PK) enhancer, in the erythroidALAS2 proximal promoter, and in the promoter of the megakaryocyte-expressed gene platelet factor 4 (PF4). We first used gel retardation assays to test whether the GST-N-finger protein could recognize these sites (Fig.5). We also tested the two promoters in transient transfection assays. As shown in Fig.6, both promoters were activated by GATA-1, and importantly both were activated by the GATA-1 mutant that contains a mutation disrupting the C-finger. Remarkably, these two promoters are preferentially activated by GATA-1 molecules that contained a mutation in the C-finger so that binding by the N-finger was obligatory. Our previous results indicate that either the N-finger or the C-finger can bind GATC sites in DNA (Fig. 3). It appears that GATA-1 activation is more potent when the C-finger is disrupted, and GATA-1 is tethered to the DNA exclusively by its N-finger.Figure 6Transactivation of the ALAS2 and PF4 promoters containing TGATCT sites does not require the C-finger.

Wild type and mutant N-finger (C204A) and C-finger (C258A) GATA-1 proteins were tested as shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We carried out an additional experiment to confirm that the N- and C-fingers were behaving as expected in these assays. It has previously been shown that the GATA-1 cofactor FOG can repress GATA-mediated transactivation but only if its contact domain, i.e. the N-finger, is intact (18Fox A. Liew C. Holmes M. Kowalski K. Mackay J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2812-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of titrating in increasing amounts of FOG (Fig. 7). As expected FOG repressed wild type GATA-1. It also repressed the GATA-1 mutant with an intact N-finger, but importantly it did not repress the GATA-1 derivative with a mutant N-finger. Taken together these results indicate that FOG can bind the N-finger when it is itself bound to a GATC site on DNA. The GATA-1 gene lies on the X-chromosome and recently several naturally occurring mutations in this gene have been shown to be associated with genetic disorders (10Yu C. Raskind W.H. Niakan K.K. Matsushita M. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Orkin S.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 495Google Scholar, 19Nichols K.E. Crispino J.D. Poncz M. White J.G. Orkin S.H. Maris J.M. Weiss M.J. Nat.

Four mutations have been described: V205M is associated with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia, G208S with thrombocytopenia, R216Q with the β-thalassemia trait and thrombocytopenia, and D218G with thromobocytopenia. We prepared GST-N-finger fusion proteins carrying these substitutions and tested them for their ability to bind GATC sites in DNA (Fig.8 A). The R216Q mutation abolished recognition of GATC sites by the N-finger domain, whereas the other mutations had only minor effects. A Coomassie-stained gel showed that equivalent amounts of protein were used in this experiment (Fig.8 B). Our results are consistent with the view that the V205M, G208S, and D218G mutations act primarily by disrupting protein-protein interactions with the cofactor FOG (19Nichols K.E. Crispino J.D.

(2001) Blood, in pressGoogle Scholar) and the conclusion that the R216Q substitution affects DNA-binding by the N-finger (10Yu C. Raskind W.H. Niakan K.K. Matsushita M. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Orkin S.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 495Google Scholar). We show here that the N-finger of GATA-1 can recognize GATC motifs in DNA both in vitro and in cellular assays. This represents a new role for the N-finger, a domain that has primarily been recognized as a region involved in binding to accessory proteins, such as FOG (6Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y., Yu, C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). It has, however, been reported that the N-finger can play a subsidiary role in enhancing the stability of DNA-binding and in the recognition of particular double GATA motifs (5Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 9Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The realization that the N-finger is a genuine DNA-binding domain is consistent with the view that it can significantly influence the overall DNA binding properties of GATA-1 (9Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition to the six known mammalian GATA family proteins, there are related proteins in other vertebrates and these also contain both an N-finger and C-finger domain. The chicken GATA-1 protein has been extensively studied but independent DNA binding by its N-finger domain has not been detected (8Pedone P.V. Omichinski J.G. Nony P. Trainor C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2874-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-finger domains of the related proteins chicken GATA-2 and GATA-3 have been shown to bind DNA (8Pedone P.V. Omichinski J.G. Nony P. Trainor C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2874-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In these instances, DNA binding activity depended on the presence of a stretch of basic residues immediately N-terminal to the N-finger. This stretch does not occur in the murine GATA-1 N-finger, indicating that it is not an essential feature in all instances. We have also studied the human GATA-1 N-finger and the DrosophilaPannier/dGATAa N-finger, both of which also lack the upstream basic stretch and have detected DNA binding activity in both cases (data not shown). These results and the remarkable conservation of putative DNA-contact residues in the N-fingers (Refs. 2Lowry J.A. Atchley W.R. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 3Teakle G.R. Gilmartin P.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 100-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 7Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar and Figs. 1 and9) suggest that many GATA N-fingers may have the ability to bind DNA to some extent, but since the binding is relatively weak, detection of independent binding may depend on the biophysical properties of the particular proteins and the precise assay conditions used. Our results suggest that GATA-1 can bind DNA using either the N- or the C-finger. The in vitro binding experiments suggest that it can bind GATC sites using either the N-finger or the C-finger, and that it can bind (T/A)GATA(A/G) motifs using the C-finger. GATA-1 also recognizes double GATA-motifs in a small subset of promoters. In these cases GATA-1 presumably binds using both fingers (9Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28157-28166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus the configuration of GATA-1 on different promoters may vary: it may bind single typical TGATAA sites with the C-finger, GATC sites with either the N- or C-finger and double GATA sites with both fingers. This realization is interesting given that the activity of GATA-1 has been found to vary in different promoter contexts. In some cases, it can act as a strong activator of transcription, but on other promoters it has been found to have little activity, and on others it can repress gene expression (1Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar, 9Trainor C.D. Ghirlando R. Simpson M.A. J. Biol.

In our experiments GATA-1 functioned as an activator regardless of whether it was binding through the N-finger or the C-finger but interestingly it activated GATC site-dependent promoters more strongly when the C-finger was mutated and hence binding by the N-finger was obligatory (Fig.7). It is possible that the different topology of GATA-1 at the promoter influences its interactions with cofactors and its ultimate transcriptional output. In this context it is notable that both zinc fingers of GATA-1 have been demonstrated to interact with a number of other transcription factors, including Sp1, PU.1, and GATA-1 itself, and transcriptional co-regulators such as FOG, CBP, and E-RC1 (6Tsang A.P.

The binding of the two fingers to GATA and GATC motifs in DNA may limit the range of interactions that the protein can make with cofactors, and thus the precise promoter configuration will be critical to its activity. The best characterized cofactor of GATA-1 is the zinc finger protein FOG (6Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y., Yu, C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), which recognizes a conserved face on the N-finger domain (Figs. 1 and 9). The key contact residues are not conserved in the C-finger and accordingly FOG does not bind this domain (Refs. 6Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y., Yu, C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M.

The N-finger domains of several other mammalian GATA proteins, including GATA-2, -3, and -4 also contain these contact residues, and they have been shown to bind FOG (6Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E.

A. 1999; 96: 950-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a GATA protein from Drosophila, termed Pannier or dGATAa, also interacts with a FOG family protein, U-shaped (35Haenlin M. Cubadda Y. Blondeau F. Heitzler P. Lutz Y. Simpson P. Ramain P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3096-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This result suggests that GATA and FOG proteins share a long evolutionary association. The recently described V205M, G208S, R216Q, and D218G mutations in individuals suffering genetic anemia and/or thrombocytopenia attest to the importance of the N-finger domain in vivo (10Yu C. Raskind W.H. Niakan K.K. Matsushita M. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Orkin S.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 495Google Scholar, 19Nichols K.E. Crispino J.D. Poncz M. White J.G. Orkin S.H. Maris J.M. Weiss M.J. Nat.

It has been shown that the V205M, G208S, and D218G mutations all interfere with the interaction between FOG and GATA-1. We have shown here that these mutations do not significantly affect DNA-binding by the N-finger (although the gel retardation technique is only semiquantitative and minor effects on DNA binding cannot be ruled out). Nevertheless this result supports the view that inhibition of cofactor binding rather than DNA binding is the major effect of these mutations. On the other hand the R216Q mutation abolishes the recognition of GATC sites by this domain but does not significantly impair binding to FOG (data not shown). The pathology observed in the individual carrying the R216Q mutation (thrombocytopenia and β-thalassemia trait) supports the view that the DNA binding activity of the N-finger domain, either its direct recognition of GATC sites or its contribution to the recognition of double GATA sites (8Pedone P.V.

Blood. 2000; 96: 495Google Scholar), is required for normal hematopoiesis in vivo. Given that the N-finger of GATA-1 can bind DNA, one can compare it to the C-finger on the basis of the known DNA binding surface on this finger (7Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Schaad O. Felsenfeld G. Trainor C. Appella E. Stahl S.J. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). One can deduce that the V205M, G208S, and D218G mutations lie away from the face that binds DNA (Fig. 9). This result is consistent with the fact that these mutations have no major effect on DNA binding. Moreover, the result confirms previous suggestions that FOG associates with DNA-bound GATA-1 and binds the exposed surface of the N-finger that is not committed to contacting DNA (36Kowalski K. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37Crispino J.D. Lodish M.B. Mackay J.P. Orkin S.H. Mol.

Structure. 2000; 8: 1157-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The residue Arg-216, on the other hand, corresponds with a residue in the C-finger that is involved in direct contact with DNA (Fig. 1), thus it is not unexpected that it has a profound effect on the binding of the N-finger to GATC sites observed here. In the same way that the different abilities of the N-finger and the C-finger bind FOG can be attributed to minor but important differences in their sequences, the differing DNA binding specificities of the two zinc fingers must also reflect sequence differences. The structure of the C-finger bound to an AGATAA site reveals that particular residues, including Leu-268, Asn-280, and Thr-267 (numbering from Fig. 1) are important for recognizing the GAT core (Ref. 7Omichinski J.G.

Further structural analysis of the N-finger of GATA-1 bound to DNA should illuminate the precise mechanisms underlying the DNA binding specificity of GATA fingers and possibly indicate whether the construction of novel derivatives with varied specificity is feasible.

Metabolism of glucose leads to an increase in the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio, closure of ATP-dependent K+ channels (KATPchannels)1 in the plasma membrane, and thus depolarization of the β-cell (1Efendic S.

This results in Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels, an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, and thereby release of insulin. [Ca2+]i does not increase to a sustained elevated level. On the contrary, stimulation of pancreatic β-cells with intermediate concentrations of glucose results in oscillations in electrical activity and [Ca2+]i (3Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P.

In a previous study we reported evidence suggesting that KATP channel activity oscillates in parallel with glucose-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations (5Larsson O. Kindmark H. Bränström R. Fredholm B.

Measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential in these cells, using the lipophilic cationic dye rhodamine 123 (Rh123), have also been reported (8Duchen M.R. Smith P. Ashcroft F.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial membrane potential in the pancreatic β-cell would be of great interest and could provide important information about the possible correlation between mitochondrial responses to glucose stimulation and events at the plasma membrane of the β-cell. Such simultaneous measurements have recently been performed in neurons (9Nowicky A.V. Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,10Dubinsky J.M. Levi Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 728-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and in mouse β-cells (11Krippeit-Drews P. Düfer M. Drews G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial membrane potential and [Ca2+]i in the β-cell, we loaded β-cells with fura-2 and Rh123 and applied the method of simultaneous measurements of these two parameters. Our methodological evaluation included an investigation of cellular Rh123 distribution as observed with confocal microscopy. We also estimated the contribution to emitted light from both dyes at the respective excitation wavelength, allowing us to correct for contaminating fluorescence.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll reagents were of analytical grade and Millipore water was used. Bovine serum albumin fraction V was from Sigma, collagenase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and fura-2/AM as well as Rh123 were from Molecular Probes Europe BV (Leiden, The Netherlands). Statistical summaries of data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Where appropriate, the possible statistical significance of differences between two sets of data was tested using Student's t test for unpaired data. In all experimental protocols, β-cells from at least three different animals were used, if not otherwise specified.Animals and Preparation of CellsAdult obese mice (gene symbol ob/ob) of both sexes were obtained from a local colony and starved for 24 h. The animals were killed by decapitation and the islets isolated using a collagenase technique (12Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M.K. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). The islets of these mice contain more than 90% β-cells (13Nilsson T. Arkhammar P. Hallberg A. Hellman B. Berggren P-O. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A cell suspension was prepared and washed essentially as described previously (14Lernmark Å. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Flow Laboratories) containing 11 mm glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cell suspension was seeded onto coverslips, and the cells allowed to attach for 2 h and then cultured for up to 3 days in the above medium.MediaThe basal medium used for preparation of cells as well as experiments was a HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, with Cl− as the sole anion (15Hellman B. Endocrinology. 1975; 97: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), containing 3 mm glucose, 1.28 mm Ca2+, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin.Measurements of [Ca2+]i Simultaneously with Mitochondrial Membrane PotentialPrior to simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial membrane potential, β-cells attached to coverslips in basal medium were incubated in 2 or 3 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin. 2, 8, 12, 16, or 32 μm Rh123 was added to the incubation buffer during the last 10 min of fura-2 loading, and the coverslips were then washed. In studies of hepatocytes, the concentration of Rh123 reaches equilibrium across the plasma membrane after incubation of the cells for 10 min in a buffer containing the probe (16Wu E.Y. Smith M.T. Bellomo G. DiMonte D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Measurements were carried out with a SPEX fluorolog-2 CM1T11I system connected to an inverted microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert 35 m). The monochromators on the excitation side were set at 380 nm (fura-2) and 500 nm (Rh123). On the emission side, a band-pass filter (515–565 nm) was used. Cells were maintained at 37 °C by temperature-controlled metal jackets on both the perfusion chamber and the objective lens.Measurements and Analysis of NAD(P)H and Fura-2 Fluorescenceβ-Cells attached to coverslips were illuminated with light at 350 nm (380 nm for Fura-2), obtained using a band-pass filter in a system including a Leica DMIRB microscope with a PL Fluotar 40×/1.00–0.50 oil objective. Emitted light was collected through a 400–510 nm (500–530 nm for fura-2) band-pass filter, detected using a LSR Astrocam camera with CCD-type Site 502AB-1, and analyzed with LSR Merlin software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Cambridge, UK). Average fluorescence from separate cells was monitored and analyzed with spectral analysis to reveal the presence of different frequencies. The power spectral density function in MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) was used with Welch's method and a Kaiser window.Confocal Microscopy ExperimentsPancreatic β-cells on glass coverslips were incubated with 3 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min and, during the last 10 min, also with various concentrations of Rh123. The β-cells were then washed. The coverslips formed the bottom of a perfusion chamber and were kept at 37 °C by temperature-controlled metal jackets on both the perfusion chamber and the objective lens. Fluorescence was recorded using a confocal laser scanning microscope system (CLSM, Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Rhodamine 123 was excited with the 488 nm line of a krypton-argon laser (Omnichrome, Chino, CA), and emitted light was detected using a long-pass 515 nm barrier filter. The pinhole was set to give a confocal section thickness of no greater than 1 μm, using a 100× Leitz PL Fluotar oil immersion objective, NA 1.32. Quantification of Rh123 fluorescence from the nucleus and the cytoplasm was made with the objective focused on the center of the nucleus. This ensured minimal interference between nuclear and cytoplasmic areas and also guaranteed that fluorescence from the nuclear area was indeed originating from the nucleus. Images were processed using ImageTool (University of Texas Health Science Center), by which fluorescence intensities were averaged within defined regions of the nucleus and cytoplasm.Patch Clamp ExperimentsThe perforated whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (17Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakman B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15094) Google Scholar, 18Horn D.R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar) was used. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass coated with Sylgard resin (Dow Corning) near the tips, fire-polished, and having a resistance between 4 and 8 megaohms. Current and voltage were recorded using an Axopatch 200 patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc, Foster City, CA). During the experiments, the current and voltage signals were stored using a VR-100A digital recorder (Instrutech Corp.) and a high resolution video cassette recorder (JVC). The pipette solution consisted of (in mm): 10 KCl, 76 K2SO4, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.35, and 200 μg/ml amphotericin B (dissolved in Me2SO; final concentration of Me2SO was less than 0.1%). The extracellular solution consisted of the HEPES buffer described above under “Media.”For the experiments employing voltage clamp in combination with measurement of Rh123 fluorescence in Rh123-loaded β-cells, a HEKA EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) was used in conjunction with a Concord photometer and digital imaging setup (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Cambridge, UK). 488 nm was used as the excitation wavelength in these experiments, and emitted light was collected through a band-pass filter (515–565 nm). All data acquisition was done through the Concord instrument, which thus also registered voltage pulses versus time.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates that the typical response pattern in a glucose stimulated β-cell is hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, a simultaneous or somewhat delayed decrease in [Ca2+]i, and thereafter an increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a slight depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. When simultaneously registering [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial membrane potential, we found that the time lag between onset of mitochondrial hyperpolarization and the increase in [Ca2+]iafter glucose stimulation agrees with similar data obtained by Duchenet al. (8Duchen M.R. Smith P. Ashcroft F.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) in experiments in β-cells measuring the two parameters separately. Experiments performed when extracellular Ca2+ had been omitted show that mitochondrial hyperpolarization occurs upon glucose stimulation without any subsequent rise in [Ca2+]i. However, the process of mitochondrial hyperpolarization was slower in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Conceivably, activation of the Ca2+-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases (23Rutter G.A. Theler J.-M. Murgia M. Wollheim C.B. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22385-22390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) occurs more rapidly during glucose stimulation in the presence of a physiological concentration of extracellular, and consequently intracellular, Ca2+ and thus speeds up the initial hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane. When Ca2+ is omitted from the extracellular medium, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ will occur. Addition of high K+ or tolbutamide in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ caused a somewhat delayed transient elevation in the Rh123 signal. This seems not to be due to a pool of Rh123 molecules reporting depolarization at the level of the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by our experiments measuring Rh123 fluorescence in voltage clamped cells. Furthermore, Duchen (24Duchen M.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the Rh123 signal change in response to depolarization of mouse neurons with high K+ did not reflect plasma membrane depolarization. Our data suggest that, apparently, a stimulus that depolarizes the plasma membrane somehow signals to the mitochondria causing their inner membranes to transiently depolarize.In several experiments, there was no lag phase at all between the onset of glucose-induced hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and the initial decrease in [Ca2+]i. Thus, there seems to be a direct correlation between increased energy supply by mitochondrial metabolism and lowering of the [Ca2+]i. In a previous study of glucose-stimulated insulin-producing cells, the cellular ATP/ADP ratio increased 9 s before the initial increase in oxygen consumption (22Civelek V.N. Deeney J.T. Kubik K. Schultz V. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting a close coupling between increased cellular energy charge and activation of mitochondrial respiration. In another study in which glucose-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and plasma membrane potential in β-cells were measured simultaneously, it was observed that the onset of the decrease in [Ca2+]i occurred simultaneously with the onset of depolarization of plasma membrane potential (25Chow R.H. Lund P.-E. Löser S. Panten U. Gylfe E. J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was concluded that a nutrient-induced elevation of ATP leads to ATP-dependent removal of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm, paralleled by a slow depolarization of plasma membrane potential due to inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Conversely, it is now clear that decreased ATP levels due to inhibition of mitochondrial function result in opening of KATP channels (26Köhler M Norgren S. Berggren P.-O. Fredholm B.B. Larsson O. Rhodes C.J. Herbert T.P. Luthman H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Increases in [Ca2+]i caused by KCl or carbamylcholine stimulation resulted in different effects on mitochondrial membrane potential depending on whether the β-cells had already been stimulated with glucose. An increase in [Ca2+]i has complex effects on mitochondrial function. The mitochondrial free [Ca2+] is elevated (27Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.-M. Pralong W.-F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 28Jou M.-J. Peng T.-I. Sheu S.-S. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the influx of [Ca2+] into the mitochondria results in net depolarization of their membrane potential (24Duchen M.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 29White R.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5688-5697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Duchen M.R. Leyssens A. Crompton M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Also, mitochondrial dehydrogenases are activated (23Rutter G.A. Theler J.-M. Murgia M. Wollheim C.B. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22385-22390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this tends to hyperpolarize the mitochondria. The net effect of a [Ca2+]i-peak on mitochondrial membrane potential could thus depend on the conditions prevailing at the time,e.g. the ambient glucose concentration.The main focus of the present study was to measure mitochondrial membrane potential simultaneously with [Ca2+]ioscillations in glucose-stimulated β-cells. We found that glucose-induced [Ca2+]i-oscillations in pancreatic β-cells precede oscillations in mitochondrial membrane potential. Peaks in [Ca2+]i are followed by rapid depolarizations of mitochondrial membrane potential. These mitochondrial depolarizations are of similar amplitude and duration as those seen after high K+ or tolbutamide in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Possibly, any stimulus that depolarizes the plasma membrane will also cause transient depolarization of the polarized mitochondrial inner membrane. It is not clear what signaling mechanism could mediate this effect. However, an influence from peaks in [Ca2+]i on mitochondrial potential cannot be excluded in the case of glucose stimulation in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. When [Ca2+]i was forced to a stable, elevated level in glucose-stimulated cells previously shown to oscillate in both [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial membrane potential, the latter oscillations also subsided. A transient depolarization of the mitochondria was observed following the initial peak in [Ca2+]i during glucose stimulation irrespective of whether regular oscillations in [Ca2+]i occurred subsequently. That the initial transient depolarization of the mitochondria was due to influx of Ca2+ is supported by the fact that this effect was not observed in β-cells stimulated by glucose in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. A pacing effect of pulsatile [Ca2+]i changes on β-cell metabolism has been demonstrated previously (31Pralong W.-F. Spät A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27310-27314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our findings are compatible with a model of regulation of β-cell [Ca2+]i oscillations in which [Ca2+]i-nadirs occur because of temporary inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism caused by the previously elevated [Ca2+]i. This feed-back loop was recently suggested also by Krippeit-Drews et al. (11Krippeit-Drews P. Düfer M. Drews G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The model is compatible with observations in single mouse islets that oscillations in oxygen consumption are dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ or influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (32Jung S.-K. Aspinwall C.A. Kennedy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, in a recent report demonstrating oscillations in oxygen consumption in glucose-stimulated single clonal β-cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, it was argued that Ca2+cannot be the primary generator for oscillations in oxygen consumption (33Porterfield D.M. Corkey R.F. Sanger R.H. Tornheim K. Smith P.J.S. Corkey B.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The presence of oscillations in oxygen consumption per se in glucose-stimulated pancreatic islets is however clearly established (34Ortsäter H. Liss P. Lund P.-E. Åkerman K.E.O. Bergsten P. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Jung S.-K. Kauri L.M. Qian W.-J. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6642-6650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Another possible explanation for the presence of glucose-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations is that these occur because of fluctuations in the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio due to oscillations in glycolysis. Evidence suggesting glycolytic oscillations in glucose-stimulated rat islets (36Chou H.-F. Berman N. Ipp E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E800-E805PubMed Google Scholar) and in synchronized suspensions of mouse β-cells (37Nilsson T. Schultz V. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B. Tornheim K. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) has been presented. Oscillations in β-cell glycolysis occurring as a consequence of the properties of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase have been suggested to cause oscillations in KATP channels and [Ca2+]i (38Tornheim K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, local events close to the ion channels in the plasma membrane, e.g. local ATP consumption at the sites of plasma membrane Ca2+-pumps, could play a role in the regulation of glucose-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations. Such local events could regulate the activity of plasma membrane KATP channels.Transient inhibition of cellular metabolism is expected to inhibit the reduction of NAD(P) to NAD(P)H. We measured cellular NAD(P)H levels as reflected by autofluorescence levels and, using spectral analysis, tried to detect low amplitude oscillations in NAD(P)H fluorescence Unfortunately, the amplitude and period of fluctuations in NAD(P)H fluorescence were often similar to those of spontaneously and sporadically occurring oscillations in excitation light intensity. Therefore, we were unable to demonstrate unequivocally the presence of oscillations in NAD(P)H.The present study evaluates the method of simultaneous measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential and [Ca2+]i in the pancreatic β-cell using fluorescent dyes. We have clearly shown that glucose-induced [Ca2+]i peaks in these cells are followed by mitochondrial membrane depolarization episodes. These mitochondrial depolarizations may coincide with episodes of decreased mitochondrial ATP production and thus result in the transient opening of plasma membrane KATP channels, plasma membrane repolarization, temporary closure of L-type Ca2+ channels, and transient lowering of the [Ca2+]i. We have also demonstrated that the effect on mitochondrial membrane potential of agents that depolarize the plasma membrane, or that release Ca2+ from intracellular stores, is dependent on ambient glucose concentration and/or the extracellular Ca2+level. Glucose stimulates insulin secretion as a consequence of being metabolized by the pancreatic β-cell. Metabolism of glucose leads to an increase in the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio, closure of ATP-dependent K+ channels (KATPchannels)1 in the plasma membrane, and thus depolarization of the β-cell (1Efendic S. Kindmark H. Berggren P.-O. J. Intern. Med. Suppl. 1991; 735: 9-22PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berggren P.-O. Larsson O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This results in Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels, an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, and thereby release of insulin. [Ca2+]i does not increase to a sustained elevated level. On the contrary, stimulation of pancreatic β-cells with intermediate concentrations of glucose results in oscillations in electrical activity and [Ca2+]i (3Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P.

https://openalex.org/W2051625323,"Amino acid residues in region 2 of ς70 have been shown to play an important role in the strand separation step that is necessary for formation of the functional or open RNA polymerase-promoter complex. Here we present a comparison of the roles of basic and aromatic amino acids in the accomplishment of this process, using RNA polymerase bearing alanine substitutions for both types of amino acids in region 2. We determined the effects of the substitutions on the kinetics of open complex formation, as well as on the ability of the RNA polymerase to form complexes with single-stranded DNA, and with forked DNA duplexes carrying a single-stranded overhang consisting of bases in the −10 region. We concluded that two basic amino acids (Lys414 and Lys418) are important for promoter binding and demonstrated distinct roles, at a subsequent step, for two aromatic amino acids (Tyr430 and Trp433). It is likely that these four amino acids, which are close to each other in the structure of ς70, together are involved in the nucleation of the strand separation process. Amino acid residues in region 2 of ς70 have been shown to play an important role in the strand separation step that is necessary for formation of the functional or open RNA polymerase-promoter complex. Here we present a comparison of the roles of basic and aromatic amino acids in the accomplishment of this process, using RNA polymerase bearing alanine substitutions for both types of amino acids in region 2. We determined the effects of the substitutions on the kinetics of open complex formation, as well as on the ability of the RNA polymerase to form complexes with single-stranded DNA, and with forked DNA duplexes carrying a single-stranded overhang consisting of bases in the −10 region. We concluded that two basic amino acids (Lys414 and Lys418) are important for promoter binding and demonstrated distinct roles, at a subsequent step, for two aromatic amino acids (Tyr430 and Trp433).

RNA polymerase core enzyme RNA polymerase holoenzyme RNA polymerase holoenzyme reconstituted from core and purified ς70 electrophoretic mobility shift assay oligodeoxyribonucleotide single-stranded wild type RNA synthesis in prokaryotes is carried out by a multi-subunit RNA polymerase commonly referred to as the core enzyme (E).1 For promoter recognition, a sigma (initiation) factor is required; it interacts with the core polymerase to yield the holoenzyme (Eς), which is able to form an initiation-competent complex at promoter sequences in a multistep process involving conformational changes in both the protein and the DNA (1Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 2Roe J.H. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol.

A striking feature of such a complex is a region of strand separation that spans about 14 base pairs from the upstream edge of the conserved −10 promoter element to just beyond the start site of transcription initiation (4Siebenlist U. Simpson R.B. Gilbert W. Cell. 1980; 20: 269-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). It is thought that, kinetically, strand separation initiates in the −10 region and proceeds in a downstream direction. Measurement of the size and location of the region of strand separation as a function of temperature shows that at low temperatures a small single-stranded region can be detected that, as the temperature is increased, expands toward the start site (3deHaseth P.L.

In addition, the introduction of nicks and mismatches in the −10 region is more effective in the acceleration of open complex formation than if such distortions are introduced at a more downstream position (8Roberts C.W.

The predominant sigma factor in Escherichia coli, which enables recognition of promoters of housekeeping genes, is referred to as ς70. Sequence comparison has shown that a large group of sigma factors shows significant homology to ς70. Four regions of sequence conservation have been identified, of which some have been subdivided to reflect the most extensive sequence conservation (10Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). A large body of data has implicated region 2.3 of the main sigma factors of E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and other prokaryotes in the nucleation of the strand separation. This process eventually results in the formation of the active or open complex, possibly by facilitating base flipping of the highly conserved A at −11 of the nontemplate strand. The supporting experimental evidence has been derived from analysis of the effects of alanine substitution for aromatic amino acids on open complex formation (5Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 37: 5959-5967Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and on the ability of RNA polymerase to interact with model substrates such as single-stranded DNA (12Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and duplexes carrying regions of unpaired DNA (14Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), also referred to as forked templates (15Guo Y. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11655-11660Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The former are thought to model the unpaired regions of the strand-separated bubble, the latter the junction between double- and single-stranded DNA of the bubble. Based on the use of forked templates, Gralla and co-workers (14Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have concluded that Tyr430 and Trp433 of region 2.3, which jut out of the body of the protein (16Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), are particularly important for the initiation of the strand separation process. In this paper we demonstrate that alanine substitutions at the positions of Tyr430 and Trp433 lead to different effects on the interaction of Eς70with forked DNA. We provide new results in support of the idea that multiple aromatic amino acids jointly interact with single-stranded DNA downstream of the region where strand separation is initiated. Our results allow us to single out two basic amino acid residues in region 2 (lysines 414 and 418) as being particularly important for the interaction of RNA polymerase with DNA. Finally, we demonstrate that the substitutions of alanines for basic amino acids in region 2 have effects that are fundamentally different from those of substitutions for aromatic amino acids in the same region. Oligonucleotides (oligos) were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. or Genset. Nonradioactive NTPs and dNTPs were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. CpA was from Sigma. [γ-33P]ATP, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]UTP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from either New England Biolabs or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Eς70 core enzyme was prepared as described (17Gonzales N. Wiggs J. Chamberlin M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) or purchased from Epicentre. 5′ end-labeled DNA oligonucleotides were generated by incubation with [γ-33P]- or [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) using established procedures. The two strands of forked DNA templates were re-annealed at concentrations of 100 nm (5′ end-labeled nontemplate strand) and 150 nm (unlabeled template strand) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.9 at 25 °C) and 50 mm NaCl by heating to 90 °C and slow cooling. All manipulations of the ς70 coding region were performed on the pLHN12-His expression plasmid, an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible version of Pet11a vector from Novagen exactly as previously described (11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Site-directed single mutations were introduced using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the appropriate primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenized fragments were subcloned into the wild type pLHN12-His expression vector using the PstI and BamHI restriction enzymes, and the recombinant plasmids were resequenced (Molecular Biology core facility at Case Western Reserve University) to verify the lack of undesired mutations in the entire subcloned DNA. Successful clones were transformed into E. coli strain DH5a for maintenance and BL21(DE3) for over-expression. Wild type and mutant ς70 bearing an amino-terminal (his)6 tag were purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) host expression cells containing pLHN12-His vectors with recombinant rpoDgenes as described previously (11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For all experiments described here, RNA polymerase holoenzymes were reconstituted in storage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol) from purified E. coli core enzyme (Epicentre) and purified ς70 in a molar ratio of 1:5 at 4 °C for 1 h. Proper interaction with core was verified by a gel mobility shift assay (11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In experiments to determine the k obs for heparin resistant (open) complex formation, we used a template in which the λPR promoter was inactivated by two mutations in its −35 region, whereas the λPRM promoter had an “up” mutation in its −10 region (TAGATT to TAGAAT). The experiments were carried out as described previously (11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, about 2–5 nm32P-labeled DNA fragments (obtained by polymerase chain reaction and polyacrylamide gel purification) were incubated with 200 nm Eς70 at 37 or 20 °C in 20 ml HEPES buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), containing 50 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, for various amounts of time. Each reaction was challenged with heparin to 100 µg/ml for 1 min prior to the addition of the loading solution and loading onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) run at room temperature. Frozen gels were autoradiographed and quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The radioactivity in each band, as the percentage of the total in the lane, was plotted versusthe time of incubation with the Eς70. Thek obs for the wild type and mutant RNA polymerases were determined by fitting the data to the equationy = Yf * (1 − exp(−t× k obs)) + Yo, wherey = the percent of open complexes formed,t = time of DNA/Eς70incubation, Yf and Yo are the limiting values fory, and k obs is the pseudo-first order rate constant. All reactions were performed in HEPES buffer (see above). Binding to single-stranded (ss) DNA was studied by incubating 5′ 32P-labeled DNA oligo (10 nm) andEς70 (65 nm) for 30 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of loading solution and loading onto a 5% nondenaturing gel, which was run at 4 °C (13Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The intensity of bands corresponding to free and Eς70-bound oligo was determined by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Binding to forked templates was determined similarly, except that the reactions were subjected to a 10-min challenge with 100 µg/ml heparin prior to loading onto the gel at 25 °C (15Guo Y. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11655-11660Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To determine the stability ofEς70-forked DNA complexes, 40-µl solutions were prepared containing 10 nm32P-labeled forked DNA template and 65 nm Eς70in HEPES buffer. After a 30-min incubation at 25 °C, heparin was added to 100 µg/ml, and at regular time intervals 4.5-ml aliquots were removed for analysis on a 5% nondenaturing gel as described above. DNase I footprinting experiments were carried out as described (11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) on DNA fragments with wt sequence, for which the observed footprint is at the PR promoter. The DNA substrates were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using 5′-33P labeled primers and purified on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. RNA polymerase was incubated with labeled promoter DNA in 20 µl of HEPES buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. At the conclusion of the incubation period, heparin was added to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml. After the MgCl2 concentration was adjusted to 10 mm the DNA was cut with 0.4 units of DNase I (Ambion) for 30 s at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated and analyzed on denaturing gels as described previously (11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Abortive initiation assays were done essentially as described (19Gussin G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 45-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of open complex formation at the λPR promoter, the unlabeled DNA fragment (2–5 nm) (obtained by polymerase chain reaction) andEς70 (200 nm) were incubated in transcription buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. After the incubation period heparin was added to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml, and reactions were further incubated for 5 min. To initiate transcription, CpA and 32P-labeled UTP were added (providing final concentrations of 0.5 mm CpA, 50 µm UTP, and 10 µCi of [α-32P]UTP). The reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C after which 5 ml of transcription stop solution (7 m urea, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.4% (w/v) SDS, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% bromphenol blue, and 0.5% xylene cyanol FF) was added. The CpApU was separated from the substrates on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were frozen and exposed to film for 2–3 h. The intensities of the bands corresponding to UTP and CpApU were determined by densitometry. The ς70 mutant set used in this study is shown in Fig. 1a. It consists of alanine substitutions for basic and aromatic amino acids and one nonpolar residue (I435A; also I435L). All basic amino acids in region 2.3 as well as two residues in regions 2.2 and one in 2.4 are included. The aromatic amino acids (described in Ref. 11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) are all in region 2.3; only the buried residue Phe419 and residue Tyr421 from this region were not substituted. Studies from Gralla and co-workers (14Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have made use of an overlapping set of substitutions extending from Tyr425 in the C-terminal direction through Ile452. The results presented here extend those of the latter two studies. With the exception of ς70 with alanine or leucine substitutions for Ile435, all were able to bind core as determined by a gel mobility shift assay (data not shown), which was carried out exactly as described (11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Ile435 residue is highly conserved, probably for structural reasons, as it is buried in the ς70 structure. Even a conservative substitution of this residue with leucine apparently leads to major structural defects that interfere with ς70 core interactions. DNase I footprinting of complexes of the Eς70holoenzyme, reconstituted with wt ς70 or ς70 containing substitutions in basic amino acids of region 2 (see Fig. 1), and the PR promoter is shown in Fig.2. The Eς70 and the promoter were incubated for 30 min prior to a heparin challenge for 1 min and exposure to DNase I for 30 s. With the exception ofEς70 reconstituted with K414A ς70, all holoenzymes afforded complete protection over a region of DNA between −50 and +20. At 37 °C, for the PRpromoter, such an extended footprint is characteristic of the open RNA polymerase-promoter complex. Holoenzyme containing the Lys414 ς70 afforded only partial protection, consistent with the observation that this mutantEς70 forms open complexes with only about 25% of the DNA even after long incubation times, as compared with over 60% for the others (data not shown). No evidence was obtained for a heparin-sensitive complex with a “short” footprint, characteristic of a closed complex, with any of the Eς70tested bearing alanine substitutions for basic amino acids. In Fig. 3, the rate of open complex formation at PRM −10up forEς70 containing substitutions in basic amino acids is compared with the rates previously reported forEς70-bearing substitutions in aromatic amino acids (data from Ref. 11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar; note that YW bears alanine substitutions at positions 430 and 433; YYW, at 425, 430, and 433; FYW at 427, 430, and 433; and FYWW, at 427, 430, 433, and 434). Just as with the aromatic amino acids (5Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 37: 5959-5967Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Juang Y.-L. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1470-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Aiyar S.E. Juang Y.-L. Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11501-11507Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the Eς70bearing Ala substitutions at basic amino acid residues Arg422, Arg423, Lys426, and Arg436 confer cold sensitivity compared withEς70 reconstituted with wt ς70. However, at 37 °C these same four substitutions have relatively minor effects on Eς70 function. In contrast, substitutions at Lys414 and Lys418 lead, even at 37 °C, to very slow formation of open complexes. The W433A substitution has an equally large effect. Only theEς70 reconstituted with triply or quadruply substituted ς70 had lower rates of formation of open complexes (this pattern is confirmed by abortive initiation data shown in Fig. 4; see below). Because of the low precision in the data for K414A, we were unable to assess whether the temperature dependence data obtained for this substitution were reliable.Figure 4Open complexes formed withEς70 containing mutant ς70 are able to catalyze formation of a phosphodiester bond. DNA containing the wt PR promoter of bacteriophage λ was incubated with wt and variantEς70 for 30 min, whereupon the complexes were challenged with heparin for 1 min followed by addition of CpA and UTP and further incubation for 15 min prior to loading on gel to separate radiolabeled CpApU and UTP. The amount of label in the UTP and CpApU was quantified and the data normalized to the fraction of label in the CpApU product observed with wt Eς70.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Analogous results were obtained in experiments in which the formation of Eς70-promoter complexes, competent for formation of the first phosphodiester bond, was monitored by determination of the synthesis of the trinucleotide CpApU from CpA and UTP. In these experiments, Eς70 and promoter DNA are incubated for 30 min prior to a 1-min heparin challenge and addition of the RNA synthesis substrates. The amount of trinucleotide synthesis reflects the formation, during the 30-min incubation period, of complexes that were competent to initiate RNA synthesis. The ranking of the mutant Eς70 in this experiment roughly mirrors that established by their relative k obsof open complex formation, with K414A and K418A each being about as detrimental as multiple substitutions for aromatic amino acid residues. However, in contrast to the data shown in Fig. 3, here the K418A substitution is significantly less damaging than K414A. The lack of observed effects of the R422A and R436A substitutions in this experiment stands in contrast to their effect on the rate of open complex formation (Fig. 3). This likely reflects the relatively long preincubation between Eς70 and the DNA in the abortive initiation experiments, which permits detection of only severe effects. To better pinpoint the nature of the defects in the substituted sigma factors that are responsible for their impaired function, we employed the model templates shown in Fig. 1, b and c. To assess the extent to which the substitutions might impede the ability of Eς70 to interact with the single-stranded DNA, and thereby render it less competent in propagating strand separation during open complex formation, we determined the ability of the mutant Eς70 to interact with ssDNA. It had been shown previously that Eς70 holoenzyme, but not free ς70 or core enzyme, is able to sequence-specifically interact with single-stranded DNA spanning the −10 promoter element and having the sequence of the non-template strand of promoter DNA (12Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22Fedoriw A.M. Liu H. Anderson V.E. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11971-11979Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two oligos were employed, bearing either the consensus TATAAT −10 sequence or a non-consensus variant, CATAAT (Fig. 1 b). The results are shown in Fig.5. Core, while not showing any sequence specificity, does have a relatively high affinity for both oligos in accordance with previous observations of its high affinity for ssDNA (23deHaseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1612-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, the departure from such behavior, as observed with all of the reconstituted Eς70 tested here, constitutes independent verification that the mutated ς70s indeed bind to core under the conditions of the experiment. All Eς70 variants bind better to the consensus oligo, demonstrating that the assay was indeed detecting sequence-specific binding. The salient finding here is the poor binding that is observed with the Eς70 bearing the Ala substitutions for positive amino acids in ς70 (K414A, K418A, R423A, and K426A), establishing an interaction of the DNA with amino acids residues on ς70 that extend beyond region 2.3 (Lys414) and are contained on both the nearly parallel α helices 13 and 14. In addition, the Y425A substitution as well as triple and quadruple substitutions of alanine for aromatic amino acids are detrimental. The effect of the Y425A substitution (also seen for the equivalent amino acid in ςA (24Huang X. Lopez de Saro F.J. Helmann J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2603-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) is especially interesting as it is far removed on the structure from the location of residue Gln437, thought to interact with the T at position −12. It serves to define a potential path of the ssDNA on ς70 in an open complex. Guo and Gralla (15Guo Y. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11655-11660Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have established “forked” DNAs, modeling the junction between double- and single-stranded regions, as particularly useful model templates, able to form heparin-resistant complexes with Eς70. We have employed here the “short fork” containing a minimal ss region consisting of just the A at −11, as well as the “long fork,” where the ss extension covers the entire −10 sequence (see Fig. 1 c). The results are shown in Fig. 6.Eς70 containing ς70 with the Y430A and K418A single substitutions, as well as those containing multiple substitutions including Y430A, are particularly deficient in their ability to bind the short fork. On the other hand, the Y425A, R422A, and K426A substitutions, which drastically affect the ability ofEς70 to bind ssDNA, have very small effects, if at all, as compared with the wt ς70. AllEς70 variants bind the long fork more tightly than the short fork, in most cases so tightly that the ability to discriminate differences in binding affinities is likely to be outside the useful window of this experiment. However, with the long fork, the multiply substituted ς70 variants could be differentiated; the extent of binding decreases in the order YW > YYW > FYW > FYWW, indicating that substitutions at positions 425–434 affect the interaction of the long fork withEς70. The binding of the short fork may have reached the other extreme (background) with theEς70 containing the multiple substitutions. Thus it is not possible to conclude that the multiple substitutions do not affect the binding of the short fork and to infer from these data alone that, for the long fork, these substitutions mostly affect the interaction with the ssDNA tail downstream of −11A. However the data for the interaction of Eς70 with single-stranded DNA (Fig. 5), where the binding affinity decreased in a similar order, YW > YYW > FYW ≥ FYWW, would seem to lend support to such a conclusion. We also determined the stabilities of the heparin-resistant complexes formed with Eς70 containing the wt and mutant sigma factors. We show elsewhere 2L. Tsujikawa, O. Tsodikov, and P. L. deHaseth, manuscript in preparation. that formation of a stable complex between Eς70 and the short fork DNA proceeds kinetically through a heparin-sensitive intermediate. At equilibrium, a substantial fraction of the heparin-sensitive complexes persist; upon addition of heparin these complexes dissociate with a rate that is too fast to measure by the manual mixing methods employed here.2 Our experiments address the stability of the fraction of the complexes that dissociate with a slower rate. All substitutions that were assayed in the course of this study affect the stability of these complexes (see Fig.7); the half-lives for the complexes formed with the variant Eς70 are less than half of those for wt Eς70, which is remarkably stable, with a half-life of over 100 min. The complex of Y430AEς70 with the short fork has a half-life of about 15 min, and substitutions of alanine for additional aromatic amino acids other than Tyr430, are not found to further destabilize the complex. The next most labile complexes were those formed with Eς70 containing singly substituted ς70 K425A and F427A, which had half-lives of about 30 min and thus were twice as stable. The experiments presented here were carried out to study nucleation of strand separation as orchestrated by region 2 of E. coli ς70. From the findings we conclude that both basic and aromatic residues are important for open complex formation: All basic residues examined, with the possible exception of Arg422, play a role in open complex formation, as is most evident at 20 °C, but substitutions for Lys414 and Lys418 have the most prominent effects. Substitutions at Lys414, Arg423, Lys426, and Arg436 affect ssDNA binding and at Lys414 and Lys418 formation of a heparin-resistant complex with forked DNA. We previously established the involvement of Tyr425, Phe427, Tyr430, and Trp433 in open complex formation. Here we show that Tyr425, Phe427, and Tyr430 are important for interaction with ssDNA, Phe427, Tyr430, and Trp433 for formation of a heparin-resistant complex with forked DNA and Tyr430 for its stabilization. Because Phe427 is buried (16Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), the effects of its substitution could be indirect. Trp334 may be involved in forked DNA binding (Ref. 14Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 6) but we have insufficient data for this residue. Together with the data from Gralla's group (14Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we conclude that residues of ς70 from 414 to 452, thus including helix 13 (16), the connecting loop, and helix 14, are involved in formation of an open complex. We attempted to correlate the deficiency in either ssDNA binding or formation of a heparin-resistant Eς70-forked complex, with the k obs of open complex formation. No significant correlation was observed between the fraction of ssDNA bound (Fig. 5) and k obs (Fig. 3) (R 2 = 0.03). However, in searching for a correlation between k obs for the various mutantEς70 and their ability to form a heparin-resistant complex with the short fork, a peculiar but striking difference in the behavior of Eς70 bearing alanine substitutions for basic and aromatic amino acids in region 2 came to light, as shown in Fig. 8. If the entire data set is considered, a reasonable (R 2= 0.7) correlation is observed between the k obsand the % forked DNA bound in a heparin-resistant complex. However, the correlation was much better (R 2 = 0.94) when only substitutions of alanine for basic residues were considered; the corresponding linear least squares fit is displayed in Fig. 8. The aromatic residues are clearly off the line. The points for Y433A, F427A, and Y425A (e, f, and g, respectively) lie above the plot (i.e. compared with the substitutions for basic amino acids, they bind better to the forked DNA than expected based on their value of k obs for open complex formation). The points for the multiply substituted sigma factors (a, b, and c) as well as for Y430A (d) show the opposite behavior. There was no a priori reason for expecting a correlation between the kinetic data for open complex formation at promoters and the equilibrium data for the extent of short fork binding. However, the fact that one is observed indicates that the differences in dissociation rates (or half-lives) we observe for the forked DNAs (see Fig. 7) might be small compared with the differences that exist in the association rate constants. Then the fork binding data would essentially reflect relative rates of formation of complexes. Some time ago, Record and colleagues (2Roe J.H. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) as well as Buc and McClure (1Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) showed that formation of an open complex proceeds through at least two intermediates. R+P⇌R·Pc1⇌R·Pc2⇌R·P0 SCHEME1Here R represents the RNA polymerase holoenzyme and P the promoter. R·Pc1 is the first sequence-specific complex formed, where the strands have not yet separated; it is often referred to as the closed complex. R·Pc2 is the second intermediate, where Eς70 may have undergone a conformational change and the nucleation of strand separation may have taken place, perhaps by the flipping of the −11A out of the helix (14Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We interpret our results in terms of the basic and aromatic residues being involved in the different steps of Scheme 1. We have shown previously that the aromatic amino acids of ς70region 2.3 were probably involved in the second step of Scheme 1, the interconversion between R·Pc1 and R·Pc2(11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In agreement with this interpretation, the results obtained here show that Eς70, bearing multiple substitutions for aromatic amino acids, is deficient in binding ss and short fork DNA as well as in stabilizing Eς70-short fork complexes. Based on the results presented here, we conclude that the basic amino acid residues would facilitate the formation of R·Pc1. This conclusion is supported by the comparison of affinities with which Eς70 bearing alanine substitutions for these residues bound short fork DNA.2 It also is consistent with the failure to observe a heparin-sensitive short footprint for these mutant Eς70 (data not shown) as was observed for the YYW and FYWEς70 (11Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Residues Lys414, Lys418, Tyr430, and Trp433 appear particularly important for progressing through the individual steps shown in Scheme 1. Our results indicate that Lys414, Lys418, and Tyr430 are vital in the formation of heparin-resistantEς70-forked DNA complexes; in addition, Tyr430 plays a crucial role in the stabilization of these complexes. The effects of alanine substitutions for Lys414, Lys418, and Trp433 on open complex formation are evident at both 20 and 37 °C, whereas the effect of substitution for Tyr430 apparently can be masked partially at 37 °C but not at 20 °C. These four amino acid residues are close to each other in ς70; they are located within a sphere with a radius of about 5 Å in the structure of ς70 (16Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We propose that, together, they participate in the nucleation of strand separation. The roles of the two basic amino acids would be to hold the promoter DNA in the proper orientation and allow the aromatic amino acids to nucleate the strand separation process, likely by flipping the −11A out of the helix by a mechanism that is not yet fully understood. It has been proposed that the aromatic rings of residues 430 and 433 would sandwich the −11A in between them (14Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This model is unlikely to be entirely correct, as our findings clearly indicate that alanine substitutions for the two residues do not behave similarly in all assays. The substitution for Tyr430 has a much more pronounced effect on forked DNA binding to Eς70, whereas substitution for Trp433 has a greater effect onk obs for open complex formation at 37 °C. Also, it is evident from the results presented in Fig. 8 that Y430A behaves differently from the other single substitutions for aromatic amino acids we examined. One possibility for reconciling the findings is that Trp433 participates in “forcing” the flipped base out of a DNA duplex, whereas Tyr430 would interact with the flipped out base as provided either by the forked DNA or subsequent to the action of Trp433 on duplex DNA. It is also unlikely that three electron-rich rings, such as those of Tyr430, −11A, and Trp433, would engage in the formation of a sandwich. Such a sandwich has been proposed for the human 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (25Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), but the DNA base in that case is alkylated and electron-deficient. It is more likely that the putatively flipped out −11A would partially overlap one of the aromatic residues, perhaps the tyrosine at 430, so that electron-deficient regions of one would be over the electron cloud of the other. This would also be more consistent with the structural and mutagenesis data that have been reported for flipped out bases, which are found in close proximity to just one aromatic amino acid residue. This is a tryptophan in the case of the E. coli repair enzyme AlkA (26Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T.

Another aromatic residue could be involved in the above mentioned forcing out of the flipped base or could be interacting edge-on with it, like tyrosines 162 and 159, respectively, of human 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (25Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and here possibly Trp433 and/or Trp334."

Several members of the leucine-rich repeat protein family present in the extracellular matrix of e.g. cartilage have been shown to interact with collagen and influence collagen fibrillogenesis.

Both chondroadherin and collagen interact with chondrocytes, partly via the same receptor, but give rise to different cellular responses.

The matrix macromolecules have very different structural and functional characteristics, and each component contributes differently to the organization and properties of the tissue. The matrix macromolecules are assembled in multicomponent networks where the interactions between the matrix constituents are essential for the maintenance of tissue integrity (1Heinegård D. Bayliss M.T. Lorenzo P. Brandt K.D. Doherty M. Lohmander L.S. Osteoarthritis. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 74-84Google Scholar). One of the non-collagenous proteins in cartilage is chondroadherin. It was first isolated from bovine tracheal cartilage (2Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Paulsson M. Antonsson P. Hedbom E. Wendel M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20428-20433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein and cDNA sequence of bovine chondroadherin (3Neame P.J. Sommarin Y. Boynton R.E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21547-21554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that it belongs to the family of leucine-rich repeat (LRR)1 proteins (4Patthy L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A subgroup of LRR proteins have several members in extracellular matrices and are characterized by a conserved sequenceXLXXLXLXX(N/C/T)X(L/I) followed by 9–14 less conserved residues. Overall, this sequence may be repeated up to 30 times, whereas in the extracellular proteins it usually occurs 10–11 times and in other subgroups 5–6 times. The repeat domain is flanked by two disulfide bonded loops and usually short extensions in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the protein. The crystal structure of one member of the LRR protein family, ribonuclease inhibitor, has been solved and refined at 2.5 Å (5Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). It shows that each LRR is composed of a β-sheet and an α-helix. The β-sheet that forms the consensus part of the LRR and the less conserved α-helices are exposed at different faces of the protein. Although the repeats are larger and higher in number than in the matrix proteins, it is likely that at least some features are represented in the other members of this family. A common property of the LRR proteins is that their three-dimensional structure seems to facilitate protein-protein interactions. In chondroadherin the leucine-rich sequence is repeated 11 times. This protein differs from the other members of this family of extracellular matrix proteins having two disulfide-bonded loops in the C-terminal region and also by lacking any N-terminal extension. Its different gene organization defines its own subfamily (6Landgren C. Beier D.R. Fässler R. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Genomics. 1998; 47: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Chondroadherin has, as compared with other LRR proteins exemplified by decorin and fibromodulin, a rather restricted tissue distribution, under normal conditions confined to cartilage and tendon (2Larsson T.

Sommarin Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Studies of the developing femoral head of rats showed that chondroadherin is localized mainly in the territorial matrix in different stages of articular cartilage development (7Shen Z. Gantcheva S. Månsson B. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fibromodulin and decorin on the other hand are part of the structural, interterritorial matrix in cartilage (8Hedlund H. Mengarelli-Widholm S. Heinegård D. Reinholt F.P. Svensson O. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9Miosge N. Flachsbart K. Goetz W. Schultz W. Kresse H. Herken R. Histochem. J. 1994; 26: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The precise function of chondroadherin is unknown. It has been shown to bind cells via the α2β1 integrin without stimulating cell spreading (10Camper L. Heinegård D. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Sommarin Y. Larsson T. Heinegård D. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The collagen family of proteins includes several members that are restricted to cartilage extracellular matrix. The collagens can be classified on the basis of their molecular shape and properties. Collagen type II is the major collagen found in cartilage. It is a fibril-forming collagen composed of three identical polypeptide chains folded into a unique triple helix (12Bateman J.F. Lamandé S.R. Ramshaw J.A.M. Comper W.D. Extracellular Matrix. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 22-67Google Scholar). The assembly of many collagen molecules into a fibril is a specific and tightly regulated process that takes place in the extracellular environment. The surface of the fibrils as well as of the collagen molecules themselves has properties allowing tight binding of a number of other matrix proteins. These include LRR proteins such as decorin (13Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), fibromodulin (14Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and lumican (15Rada J.A. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) as well as other collagens such as collagen type IX (16Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Irwin M.I. Mayne R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that another abundant cartilage protein, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), also can bind collagen type II (17Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Chondroadherin interactions beyond the ability to bind to cells,e.g. back to the matrix, have not been identified. Since several other LRR proteins have been shown to bind to fibril-forming collagens, we have examined the possible interaction between chondroadherin and collagen II. We now show that chondroadherin binds to collagen type II in vitro and that the binding also appears to occur in vivo. A λZAP II cDNA library made from human chondrocytes (provided by Dr. Michael Bayliss) was screened using a 450-base pair bovine chondroadherin cDNA probe. A 1444-base pair clone was isolated and purified with Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen). DNA sequencing was performed in full on both strands by standard double-strand dideoxy termination sequencing using T3, T7, and synthetic internal specific primers. A 1.4-kilobase pair human chondroadherin cDNA NotI fragment was ligated to the Epstein-Barr virus-based eucaryotic expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen, California). This vector is maintained extrachromosomally in eucaryotic cells and expresses high levels of recombinant protein (18Young J.M. Cheadle C. Foulke J.S.J. Drohan W.N. Sarver N. Gene. 1988; 62: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The transcription is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter included in the pCEP4 vector. The endogenous signal peptide of human chondroadherin was used. Using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), the construct in pCEP4 was transfected into human kidney cells expressing the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (293-EBNA cells, Invitrogen). After transfection the cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 48 h, hygromycin (Calbiochem) (160 µg/ml) was added to the culture medium to select cells. These were expanded, and when confluent, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum. The cells were left for 48 h, after which the medium was harvested and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 × g. Phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (1 mm, final concentration) was added as a protease inhibitor. One liter of collected medium was diluted 4 times to a final concentration of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, and applied to carboxymethyl cellulose cation exchange (CM52, Whatman) column previously equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris and eluted with a gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7. A polyclonal antibody against human chondroadherin was raised by immunizing a rabbit with a peptide from the C-terminal region of the protein (GQHIRDTDAFRS) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using glutaraldehyde (19Collawn, J. F., and Paterson, Y. (1989) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. A., and Struhl, K., eds) pp. 11:15:2–3, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). This antiserum has been shown to react only with chondroadherin in crude tissue extracts. The purity and identity of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antibodies raised against the C-terminal region of human chondroadherin as well as against bovine chondroadherin (2Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Paulsson M. Antonsson P. Hedbom E. Wendel M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20428-20433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fresh calf articular cartilage was dissected into 2–3 mm pieces and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline followed by 2 washes in Hepes-buffered saline supplemented with CaCl2(HBSCa) (50 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cartilage was incubated at 37 °C overnight in 15 volumes (w/v) HBSCa, supplemented with 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) (Sigma) and 10 µm cycloheximide, the latter to eliminate contribution from proteins synthesized during processing. The supernatant was collected by a brief centrifugation to remove the coarser cartilage pieces followed by centrifugation at 17,700 ×g for 30 min. Proteinases activated by APMA were inhibited by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 9.8 mm. The supernatant was finally made particle-free by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti50.2 rotor at 43000 rpm (100.000 × g) for 1 h at 4 °C. 200 ml of the supernatant from the cartilage incubate was applied to a 32-ml diethylaminoethylcellulose anion exchange (DE52, Whatman) column equilibrated in Hepes-buffered saline containing 9.8 mmEDTA, pH 7.4. The flow-through was kept and further analyzed. Elution was made with a gradient of sodium acetate (0–1.5 m, pH 7.4). Gradients (4 ml) of 10–30% glycerol in Hepes-buffered saline with EDTA (49 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 9.8 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) were prepared. Sample in the same buffer (200 µl) was applied on top and then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm (∼257,000 ×g) in a Beckman Sw60.1 swinging bucket rotor for 15 h at 18 °C. The gradients were emptied from the bottom in 200-µl fractions. Samples of the fractions from zonal rate centrifugation were prepared for SDS-PAGE by precipitation with 9 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 50 mm sodium acetate (20Paulsson M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were dissolved in sample buffer and separated on 4–16% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were either stained directly or transferred using a tank blot system (Mini Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad) to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (fluorotrans transfer membranes, Pall Filtron). Blotted membranes were blocked for additional protein binding with 3% (w/v) milk powder in 10 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.4. Primary antibody raised against bovine chondroadherin was applied in the same buffer solvent. Bound antibodies were detected after incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Collagen II was purified from pepsin-digested bovine articular cartilage as previously described (13Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 21Miller E.J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4903-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The purity of the collagen II was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Chondroadherin and collagen-containing samples from the flow-through of the DE52 column were prepared for electron microscopy either directly or after incubation with gold-labeled affinity-purified antibodies against bovine chondroadherin. Recombinant chondroadherin and collagen type II were preincubated and treated the same way as the samples isolated from the tissue extract. Samples were adsorbed to 400 mesh carbon-coated copper grids, which were previously rendered hydrophilic by glow-discharge at low pressure in air. The grids were immediately blotted, washed with two drops of water, and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate for 15 s. When used, affinity-purified antibodies were labeled with colloidal gold of 3-nm size as described by Baschong and Wrigley (22Baschong W. Wrigley N.G. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1990; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Samples were observed in a Jeol 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage and ×75,000 magnification. Images were recorded on Kodak ESTAR Thick Base 4489 plates without preirradiation at a dose of typically 2000 electrons/nm2. Evaluation of the data from electron micrographs was done as previously described (23Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). An antibody against the C-terminal region of collagen type II (a gift from Dr. Rikard Holmdahl) was used to determine the polarity of the collagen molecules. The BIAcoreTM2000 system (BIAcore AB, Sweden) was used to further characterize the interaction and to determine the binding characteristics between chondroadherin and type II collagen. In one set of experiments pure recombinant chondroadherin was concentrated, and the buffer was changed to 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 mNaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4. The carboxymethylated dextran surface on the chip (CM5 sensor chip, BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was activated with 35 µl of 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide and 35 µl of 200 mm N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide at 25 °C at a flow of 5 µl/min. Chondroadherin (35 µl at 100 µg/ml) was immobilized at 25 °C at a flow rate of 5 µl/min. One surface was used as the negative control, containing no coupled protein. Remaining activated groups were blocked with 40 µl of 1m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The immobilization of recombinant chondroadherin resulted in 5400 resonance units (1000 resonance unit = 1 ng/mm2). The binding assay was performed at 25 °C by using pepsinized collagen II at different concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 5.9 µg/ml in 9.8 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4, at 40 µl/min. The surface was regenerated by using 0.5 macetic acid, 2 m NaCl, followed by 0.1 mNaHCO3, 2 m NaCl, pH 9.2. In another set of experiments, pepsinized collagen type II (2.1 mg/ml in 0.1 m acetic acid) was diluted to 100 µg/ml in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.2, and immediately immobilized under the same conditions as above (running buffer, 10 mmHepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4). The immobilization of collagen type II resulted in 3000 resonance units. The binding assay was performed at 25 °C by using recombinant chondroadherin at different concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 4 µg/ml in 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4, applied at 40 µl/min. The surface was regenerated by using 10 mm Hepes, 2 m NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by 0.1 m NaHCO3, 2 m NaCl, pH 9.2. The BIAevaluation software (version 3.0) was used to calculate the different equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) (24Fagerstam L.G. Frostell-Karlsson A. Karlsson R. Persson B. Rönnberg I. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The screening of a human cDNA library resulted in the isolation of a 1444-base pair clone. The deduced amino acid sequence was similar to the one published (25Grover J. Chen X.N. Korenberg J.R. Roughley P.J. Genomics. 1997; 45: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, certain differences were found. At position 114 in the sequence we found leucine instead of valine, and at position 166 we found alanine instead of proline. Our sequences at these positions were found to be in agreement with the sequences from mouse (6Landgren C. Beier D.R. Fässler R. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Genomics. 1998; 47: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), rat (7Shen Z. Gantcheva S. Månsson B. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and cow (3Neame P.J. Sommarin Y. Boynton R.E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21547-21554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant chondroadherin was bound to and then eluted from a CM52 column at an ionic strength of 0.18–0.22m NaCl. The yield of native recombinant chondroadherin was between 1 and 2 µg/ml culture medium. The protein appears pure as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and Western blotting using antibodies raised against the bovine chondroadherin (2Larsson T. Sommarin Y. Paulsson M. Antonsson P. Hedbom E. Wendel M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20428-20433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as against the C-terminal region of the protein. The nature of the purified protein was verified by mass spectrometry after Lys-C digestion (not shown). Chondroadherin was released from calf articular cartilage using APMA in Hepes-buffered saline with calcium. Release without APMA was 10–15% of that with APMA and was not further analyzed. Gel filtration on Superose 6 of the supernatant representing released proteins showed that chondroadherin eluted in early fractions, indicating that it occurred in complexes of considerable size (data not shown). Ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h showed that chondroadherin remained in the supernatant, thus was not included in particles. To further study the complexes, the supernatant was subjected to anion exchange chromatography. The chondroadherin pool then separated into two fractions, one passing through and one being retained on the column. The latter was eluted together with several proteins including biglycan as a major component, at a sodium acetate concentration of 0.7–0.8 m. The pool passing through the DE column contained collagen II α1-chains (as deduced from migration on SDS-PAGE under non-reduced and reduced conditions) as well as chondroadherin (as detected by Western blot) and a few other components (data not shown). Among those other components a prominent band was identified as the C-terminal propeptide of collagen II by Western blot (data not shown). The pool containing collagen and chondroadherin was further fractionated by zonal rate centrifugation and analyzed by electron microscopy. Samples of the flow-through from the DE52 column containing several different molecular entities were further fractionated by zonal rate centrifugation in glycerol gradients. The composition of the various fractions was studied by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blot analyses of non-reduced samples. Collagen type II was detected in the upper part of the gradient with the slowest sedimentation (Fig. 2). Corresponding fractions from an identical gradient were shown to contain chondroadherin (Fig. 2). Electron microscopy showed filaments of intact monomeric collagen molecules with bound globules having the typical three-lobe appearance of the LRR proteins at distinct locations (Fig.3A). To verify their nature, the complexes were incubated with gold-labeled affinity-purified antibodies to chondroadherin before electron microscopy. The figure then shows the gold-labeled antibodies associated with the presumptive chondroadherin globules bound to collagen (Fig. 3 B). Thus the complexes isolated represent collagen with bound chondroadherin. No other molecules appeared to bind at these sites on the collagen. Similar complexes could be formed by recombination of equimolar amounts of recombinant chondroadherin and isolated pepsinized collagen II (Fig.3 C). The polarity of the collagen II molecules was identified by an antibody that recognizes an epitope close to their C-terminal end (kindly provided by Dr. Rikard Holmdahl, Lund University). The binding sites were identified by measuring the distance from the C-terminal end of the collagen to the site of chondroadherin binding. The relative abundance of chondroadherin bound at the two identified binding sites on the collagen are shown in Fig. 4. These sites are located at 185 and 267 nm from the C-terminal end of collagen. The two sites show similar occupancy in the extracted material (Fig. 4 A) and in the in vitroreconstituted complexes (Fig. 4 B). In a first set of experiments the interaction of collagen type II with immobilized chondroadherin was studied using different concentrations of collagen, resulting in the association and dissociation curves shown in Fig. 5A. Evaluation using the Langmuir model predicting a 1:1 interaction unraveled an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.9 nm. Using a model allowing for a bivalent analyte (collagen II) gave a higher K D of 44 nm for the stronger of the two putative binding sites. In another set of experiments collagen type II was immobilized, and the interaction with chondroadherin was studied (Fig. 5 B). Evaluation of these data showed that the K D of the interaction in this system was 40 nm. Alterations of cartilage matrix turnover in arthritic diseases is thought to be driven by cytokines. They induce production of proteinases and their activation through as yet not fully known mechanisms. These enzymes degrade matrix constituents, thereby affecting tissue integrity. To study the release of cartilage components, particularly chondroadherin, under the influence of activated endogenous proteinases, we treated cartilage with APMA to activate matrix metalloproteinases (26Ganu V. Goldberg R. Peppard J. Rediske J. Melton R. Hu S.I. Wang W. Duvander C. Heinegård D. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 2143-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Chondroadherin was indeed among the molecules released to the medium in buffers that show little extraction on their own. Fractionations of the released material by ion exchange chromatography and zonal rate centrifugation showed that intact collagen and chondroadherin cofractionated. This was unexpected in view of their widely different masses. It therefore appeared that the two molecules occurred in the same complexes, indicative of a tight interaction. To further identify and define the binding site(s), we performed negative staining and electron microscopy of material from the tissue extract as well as from in vitro recombined collagen and chondroadherin. The combined analyses showed that chondroadherin and collagen indeed interact and that the binding sites are identical between the material released from the tissue and the complexes formed by isolated, pure components. In both systems one major and one minor binding site, 185 and 267 nm, respectively, from the C terminus of the collagen molecule was identified. To study the quality of the interaction, pure components were analyzed using surface plasmon resonance in the BIAcore. The K D of the interaction was calculated both for the interaction when chondroadherin was immobilized and when collagen was immobilized. TheK D in the nanomolar range differs somewhat depending on which component in the interaction pair was immobilized. The tighter binding of collagen to immobilized chondroadherin may result from the two binding sites for chondroadherin on collagen enhancing the binding strength as compared with chondroadherin interacting with immobilized collagen. This assumption is further strengthened by using a model allowing for two binding sites on the analyte (collagen), which gives a K D that is some 40 times higher as compared with a model predicting a 1:1 interaction. It is also possible that the microenvironment on the chip becomes somewhat different depending on how the ligand was immobilized. The complexes released from the cartilage and characterized by electron microscopy consist of collagen type II with one or two chondroadherin molecules attached. Neither collagen nor chondroadherin seem to be degraded, indicating that their release is dependent on cleavage of their anchorage in the tissue. The complexes consist of intact chondroadherin and intact collagen, which further strengthens the assumption that these complexes occur in vivo. The collagen in the complexes is monomeric but in a mature form, without propeptides. This is particularly interesting in view of the very low abundance of non-aggregated collagen molecules being highly interactive. Since the collagen was not in its proform, it appears to have been processed in the tissue. Whether this was a result of the induced proteolysis is not clear. However, all observed collagen molecules were processed at the same time as fragmentation of other proteins like chondroadherin, and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein was limited, indicating that processing had occurred before APMA treatment. In articular cartilage, chondroadherin is located territorially, whereas most other LRR proteins also known to interact with collagen such as decorin and fibromodulin are located interterritorially, where they have structural functions in the network. It is reasonable to speculate that proteins located closer to the cells have a regulatory role, communicating between cells and matrix. Both collagen type II and chondroadherin have been shown to bind chondrocytes (11Sommarin Y. Larsson T. Heinegård D. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These cells are known to express several different integrins on their surface including α1β1 and α2β1 (27Durr J. Goodman S. Potocnik A. von der Mark H.,. von der Mark K. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 28Woods V.L.J. Schreck P.J. Gesink D.S. Pacheco H.O. Amiel D. Akeson W.H. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The α2β1 integrin has been shown to be the receptor for chondroadherin (10Camper L. Heinegård D. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas both these integrins have been shown to bind collagen type II. Even though collagen and chondroadherin interact with the same integrin, only collagen is able to induce spreading of cells adhering in vitro (11Sommarin Y. Larsson T. Heinegård D. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). By sharing one of the receptors on the chondrocyte and by interacting with each other, a complex system is created. This potentially includes cross-bridging of a number of receptors. Future work should sort out the consequences of interactions of individual components in comparison to that of the complexes, e.g. with regard to ensuing intracellular signaling and cell function. An obvious function of collagen type II in articular cartilage is to form highly organized fibers that are of fundamental importance for the mechanical properties of the tissue. Several studies have shown that the assembly of collagen fibers is influenced by other molecules like collagen type IX as well as by matrix proteins in the LRR protein family such as decorin, fibromodulin, and lumican. They all bind to fibrillar collagens type I and II (13Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 14Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol.

A consequence of this interaction is that they are able to modulate fibril formation in vitro and affect the dimensions of the fibers (29Vogel K.G. Trotter J.A. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 30Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J.

Many connective tissue disorders have been linked to alterations in collagen assemblies and, thus, function. This could be due to defects in collagen itself or to alterations in proteins involved in the assembly of collagen fibrils. Genes for several members of the LRR protein family have been functionally deleted in mice. A major phenotype in the null mutants of lumican (30Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), decorin (31Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9636-9647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) is dysregulation of the collagen fibril formation. The result is irregular thick or thin collagen fibrils. These studies verify that in vitro observation of interactions between LRR proteins and collagen are of biological importance. Chondroadherin, also a member of this LRR protein family, is now shown to interact with collagen. It is likely that also this protein influences the assembly and, thereby, the function of fibrillar collagen. Since chondroadherin is abundant in the territorial matrix, it may have a role particularly in the early events in collagen assembly. Indeed, the observation of monomeric soluble collagen with bound chondroadherin indicates a role in regulating collagen assembly. The role may particularly involve preventing premature associations of the collagen molecule into fibrils. Molecular complexes released from cartilage upon APMA treatment were separated into two chondroadherin-containing classes showing major differences in ionic charge. One fraction was now shown to represent complexes between monomeric collagen and chondroadherin. The other fraction was much more anionic. Since chondroadherin at neutral pH does not bind to DEAE-cellulose used for separation, it appears that chondroadherin is bound to an anionic “carrier” protein. In view of the presence of biglycan in this fraction, it is possible that there are complexes containing biglycan and chondroadherin and possibly other molecules. This fraction might thus represent yet another interaction with chondroadherin."

Although phosphorylation of the receptor is thought to play an important role in controlling receptor down-regulation, previous studies disagree on whether phosphorylation is actually required for the agonist-induced endocytosis of opioid receptors. Furthermore, no previous studies have determined whether phosphorylation is required for subsequent sorting of internalized receptors to lysosomes. We have addressed these questions by examining the endocytic trafficking of a series of mutant versions of DOR expressed in stably transfected HEK 293 cells. Our results confirm that phosphorylation is not required for agonist-induced endocytosis of truncated mutant receptors that lack the distal carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain containing sites of regulatory phosphorylation. However, phosphorylation is required for endocytosis of full-length receptors. Mutation of all serine/threonine residues located in the distal carboxyl-terminal tail domain of the full-length receptor to alanine creates functional mutant receptors that exhibit no detectable agonist-induced endocytosis. Substitution of these residues with aspartate restores the ability of mutant receptors to undergo agonist-induced endocytosis. Studies using green fluorescent protein-tagged versions of arrestin-3 suggest that the distal tail domain, when not phosphorylated, inhibits receptor-mediated recruitment of β-arrestins to the plasma membrane. Biochemical and radioligand binding studies indicate that, after endocytosis occurs, phosphorylation-defective mutant receptors traffic to lysosomes with similar kinetics as wild type receptors. We conclude that phosphorylation controls endocytic trafficking of opioid receptors primarily by regulating a “brake” mechanism that prevents endocytosis of full-length receptors in the absence of phosphorylation. After endocytosis occurs, subsequent steps of membrane trafficking mediating sorting and transport to lysosomes do not require receptor phosphorylation.

G protein-coupled receptor δ-opioid receptor human embryonic kidney [d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 are regulated by multiple mechanisms. Many GPCRs undergo a process of rapid desensitization within seconds to minutes after ligand-induced activation, mediated by ligand-dependent phosphorylation of receptors followed by the association of phosphorylated receptors with arrestins. This cascade of events causes functional uncoupling of receptors from heterotrimeric G proteins and promotes the rapid endocytosis of receptors by clathrin-coated pits (reviewed in Refs.1Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 2Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Endocytosis of GPCRs by clathrin-coated pits can modulate receptor activity in two ways that have opposing effects on receptor-mediated signaling. First, endocytosis can target receptors to a rapid recycling pathway that contributes to functional resensitization of signal transduction by returning dephosphorylated receptors to the plasma membrane. Second, endocytosed receptors can undergo a distinct, slower process of proteolytic down-regulation that causes a prolonged attenuation of signal transduction by reducing the total number of receptors present in cells (4Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 5Tsao P. Zastrow M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of GPCRs is of great interest because it is associated with certain pathological states and can be influenced by clinically relevant drugs (6Roth B.L. Willins D.L. Kroeze W.K.

In particular, it is not known whether phosphorylation is required for lysosomal proteolysis of opioid receptors.A recent study (7Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) has established that δ-opioid receptors are targeted to lysosomes by a highly selective molecular sorting operation that occurs within several minutes after endocytosis. Although phosphorylation is well known to promote the endocytosis and inhibit the recycling of many GPCRs (reviewed in Refs. 1Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G.

A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), it is not known at which step(s) of receptor down-regulation phosphorylation is specifically required.This question has been difficult to address because, in many systems, manipulations or mutations that block phosphorylation of receptors also strongly inhibit endocytosis by clathrin-coated pits, thereby precluding study of later step(s) in the pathway mediating receptor trafficking to lysosomes. In the present study, we have circumvented this complication by examining a previously described truncated mutant δ-opioid receptor (DOR344T) that is unable to undergo any detectable constitutive or ligand-induced phosphorylation yet, when expressed in HEK293 cells, exhibits rapid agonist-induced endocytosis by clathrin-coated pits (21Murray S.R. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24987-24991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, we have generated several other mutant full-length opioid receptors that have alterations in their trafficking properties. Our results support the hypothesis that the distal portion of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain functions as an endocytic “brake” mechanism that is released by phosphorylation. This mechanism appears to play an important role in controlling lysosomal proteolysis of full-length opioid receptors primarily by limiting the rate at which activated receptors can enter the endocytic pathway. Hence, phosphorylation does play an important role in controlling down-regulation of the full-length δ-opioid receptor by modulating its rapid endocytosis. Nevertheless, phosphorylation is not essential for rapid endocytosis of a truncated mutant receptor nor is it required for efficient sorting of truncated or full-length receptors to lysosomes after endocytosis has occurred.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and cDNA ConstructsHuman embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) cells were maintained and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture Facility). A stable cell line expressing FLAG-tagged DOR (DOR5) was generated as described previously (7Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The previously described truncated mutant DOR (DOR344T) cell line was constructed by engineering a stop codon following residue 344 in the coding sequence of the FLAG-tagged murine DOR and introducing the cDNA into HEK293 cells via calcium phosphate precipitation and G418 selection (21Murray S.R. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24987-24991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). HA-tagged versions of DOR and DOR344T were also generated in a pCDNA3.1 backbone for this study. Stable cell lines of these constructs were generated by introducing them into HEK293 cells via calcium phosphate precipitation and Zeocin selection. The receptor point mutants DOR5A and DOR3D were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis of the HA-tagged wild type DOR using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). Stable cell lines of these constructs were also generated by introducing them into HEK293 cells via calcium phosphate precipitation and Zeocin selection. At least two stable cell lines were generated and analyzed for each receptor. Double stable cell lines expressing GFP-arrestin and receptor were generated by cotransfection with both constructs using calcium phosphate precipitation followed by selection with both G418 and Zeocin. The Arg169 → Glu β-arrestin-EE was generated using the Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) of a construct described previously (16Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Relative receptor expression levels were quantified using immunofluorescence microscopy and/or radioligand binding using [3H]diprenorphine (see below for methods).Radioligand BindingAgonist-induced down-regulation of receptors was assayed in intact cells using a method described previously (39Law P.Y.

Briefly, monolayers of cells expressing FLAG-tagged full-length DOR (DOR5) and FLAG-tagged truncated mutant DOR (DOR344T) were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μm DADLE (Research Biochemicals). To ensure a saturating concentration of peptide agonist over the incubation period, monolayers incubated with DADLE were supplemented with fresh peptide every hour during the incubation. At the end of the incubation, cells were lifted with PBS supplemented with EDTA and washed four times by centrifugation with 10 ml of warm (37 °C) PBS. Then cells were washed once by centrifugation in 10 ml of Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (KHRB, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 25 mm glucose, 55 mm sucrose, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.3). Radioligand binding was carried out in 120 μl of KHRB containing equal amounts of washed cells (50–100 μg of protein) with 2 nm [3H]diprenorphine. Incubations were carried out for 30 min at room temperature and terminated by vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters (Packard Instruments) and repeated washes with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Scintiverse, Fisher) using a Beckman LS 6500 instrument. For all determinations, bound radioligand represented ≤10% of total radioligand present in the incubation, and nonspecific binding (defined by assays conducted in the presence of 10 μm naloxone) was ≤10% of counts isolated on glass fiber filters. All assays were conducted in triplicate with similar results. Results are expressed as mean picomoles of radioligand specifically bound per mg of cells assayed (protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradfordet al. (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) using reagents from Bio-Rad).Analysis of Receptor PhosphorylationReceptor phosphorylation was assessed as described previously (41Whistler J.L. Chuang H.-H. Chu P. Jan L.Y. von Zastrow M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 737-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells stably expressing receptor were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% serum to 80% confluency and then starved for 1 h in phosphate-free media. Cells were metabolically labeled for 3 h with 0.25 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then treated with the indicated agonist or incubated in the absence of agonist for 30 min. Cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaF, 80 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Receptors were immunoprecipitated, deglycosylated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gel exposed to film.β-Arrestin RecruitmentCells stably expressing both receptor and GFP-tagged β-arrestin-2 (a gift from Marc Caron) were plated to coverslips and allowed to recover for 2 days. Cells were fed HA-11 anti-HA antibody (Covance) or M1 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), as appropriate, for 30 min (1:1000, 4 μg/ml) to label epitope-tagged receptors present in the plasma membrane and then treated with the indicated agonist for 10 min. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (16Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and then receptors were stained with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch). GFP-tagged β-arrestin-2 and antibody-labeled receptor were visualized by conventional epifluorescence microscopy using a Nikon 60× NA1.4 objective and standard filter sets (Chroma Optical) that allowed dual label imaging with no detectable bleed through between channels. For the β-arrestin-1 Arg169 → Glu experiments, cells stably expressing DOR5A and transiently transfected with an EE-tagged version of β-arrestin-1 Arg169 → Glu were fed anti-HA antibody 12CA5 for 30 min, treated with agonist, fixed, and permeabilized as above. Cells were incubated with anti-EE antibodies (Covance), to recognize the overexpressed mutant β-arrestin-1 (1:1000), and a rabbit anti-IgG2b linker (Jackson ImmunoResearch 1:500). Cells were then stained with IgG1-selective fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Texas Red anti-rabbit antibodies both at 1:500. Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon 60× NA1.4 objective and standard filter sets (Chroma Optical) that allowed dual label imaging with no detectable bleed through between channels.Membrane Adenylyl Cyclase AssaysMembrane PreparationCells were grown to 80% confluency and pretreated with 2 μm DADLE or left untreated. Cells were lifted in PBS with 0.04% EDTA, washed 4 times in 15 ml of PBS to remove residual agonist, and were then resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer of 25 mm MgCl2, 75 mmTris·HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and pelleted at 2000 ×g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended with a glass potter in the same buffer and immediately assayed.Adenylyl Cyclase AssayMembranes were incubated in 30 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μmGTP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 40 μm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 200 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, and 1 μm forskolin with or without etorphine for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of HCl to 1 m and applied to acidic alumina spin columns (Pierce). Columns were washed and eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions, and eluate was counted by using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter.ImmunoblottingMonolayers of cells expressing FLAG-tagged DOR (DOR5) or truncated mutant DOR (DOR344T) were incubated in the absence or presence of 10 μm etorphine. Monolayers were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml leupeptin (Calbiochem), 200 μm chloroquine (Sigma), or 50 mm ammonium chloride (Sigma) before agonist addition, and these reagents were present in the medium during agonist incubation. Equal amounts of cell lysate (prepared by extracting monolayers with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma)) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted for FLAG-tagged receptor using M1 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by detection using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Biochemical Analysis of Receptor Endocytosis Using Cleavable Biotin: Biotin ProtectionCells were grown to 80% confluency in 10-cm plates, washed with PBS, and then treated with 3 μg/ml disulfide-cleavable biotin (Pierce) in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then washed in PBS and placed in pre-warmed media for 15 min, prior to treatment with specified ligands for varying times. Concurrent with ligand treatment, 100% and strip plates remained at 4 °C. Following ligand treatment, plates were washed in PBS, and the remaining cell surface biotinylated receptors were stripped in 50 mm glutathione, 0.3 m NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, and 1% fetal bovine serum at 4 °C for 30 min for all ligand-treated plates as well as strip plate. Cells were extracted in 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, and 10 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.4, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 (Covance), rabbit anti-mouse linker antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed 5× and incubated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs) for 2 h. Samples were then denatured in SDS sample buffer with no reducing agent and resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and biotinylated proteins were visualized with Vectastain ABC immunoperoxidase reagent (Vector Laboratories) and developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Biochemical Analysis of Receptor Degradation Using Noncleavable Biotin: Biotin DegradationProteolytic degradation of surface-biotinylated receptors was estimated using a protocol described previously (27Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected cells expressing receptor were surface-biotinylated by incubation at 4 °C with 30 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce), rinsed with Tris-buffered saline to quench the biotinylation reaction, warmed to 37 °C, and incubated under various conditions as described in the text and then chilled on ice to stop further membrane trafficking. Cells were extracted and receptor immunoprecipitates were prepared, and biotinylated receptor protein recovered in immunoprecipitates was detected by streptavidin overlay. Receptor degradation was indicated by a loss of biotinylated protein recovered in immunoprecipitates and was quantified by densitometric scanning of streptavidin overlays exposed in the linear range. Samples representing equal numbers of cells were loaded in each lane.Biochemical Analysis of Post-endocytic Receptor Degradation Using Cleavable Biotin: Biotin Protection/DegradationCells stably expressing epitope-tagged receptor were biotinylated at 4 °C with 30 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) rinsed with Tris-buffered saline to quench the biotinylation reaction, warmed to 37 °C, and incubated with or without 10 μmetorphine for 30 min or 3 h. The remaining cell surface biotin was cleaved with stripping buffer containing membrane-impermeant reducing agent (50 mm glutathione, 0.3 m NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, and 1% fetal bovine serum). Stripping was quenched, and cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10 mmTris·Cl, pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). As controls, cells were biotinylated, quenched, and lysed (100%) or biotinylated, stripped, quenched, and lysed (strip). Receptors were immunoprecipitated using antibodies to the epitope tag (either M1 (Sigma) or HA-11 (Covance)), deglycosylated using PNGase F (New England Biolabs), and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and “protected” biotinylated receptors were visualized by streptavidin overlay (Vector Laboratories) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In this way, this assay follows the fate specifically of endocytosed receptors.RESULTSA truncated, mutant δ-opioid receptor (DOR344T) missing the distal portion of the cytoplasmic tail containing all known sites of regulatory phosphorylation has been shown previously to undergo agonist-induced endocytosis in HEK293 cells (21Murray S.R. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24987-24991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B) despite its lack of phosphorylation (21Murray S.R. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24987-24991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). To examine whether phosphorylation was required for endocytosis of full-length receptors, we created a full-length mutant version of DOR in which all serine and threonine residues located in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail were mutated to alanine (DOR5A mutant receptor). These include Thr-358 and Ser-363 shown to be primary sites of DOR phosphorylation (22Kouhen O.M. Wang G. Solberg J. Erickson L.J. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Guo J. Wu Y. Zhang W. Zhao J. Devi L.A. Pei G. Ma L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous studies, the DOR5A full-length mutant receptor exhibited no detectable phosphorylation in intact cells, like the DOR344T truncated mutant receptor described previously (Fig.1 A).Visualization of receptors by fluorescence microscopy indicated that the DOR5A mutant receptor localized primarily in the plasma membrane of cells incubated in the absence of agonist (Fig. 1 B, upper panels). However, in contrast to the pronounced agonist-induced internalization of the phosphorylation-defective DOR344T-truncated mutant receptor (Fig. 1 B, lower panels), fluorescence microscopy indicated that the DOR5A mutant receptor failed to exhibit detectable internalization even after 30 min of continuous exposure to a saturating concentration of agonist (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). Quantification of receptor internalization using a biochemical assay described previously (16Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), biotin protection, that measures internalization of biotinylated receptors by inaccessibility to a membrane-impermeant reducing agent indicated that internalization of the DOR5A mutant receptor was inhibited >90% relative to that of wild type DOR or DOR344T observed under similar conditions (Fig.1 C). Thus, the distal portion of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of DOR, although not necessary for agonist-induced endocytosis of truncated mutant receptors, strongly inhibits endocytosis of full-length receptors when mutated to prevent phosphorylation.We next examined whether phosphorylation might regulate the inhibitory function of the distal tail domain on receptor endocytosis. To accomplish this, the phosphorylation-defective DOR5A construct was modified by replacing residues in positions 358, 361, and 363 with aspartate (DOR3D mutant receptor). These positions correspond to a distal serine/threonine cluster containing primary site(s) of phosphorylation in wild type DOR (22Kouhen O.M. Wang G. Solberg J. Erickson L.J. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Guo J. Wu Y. Zhang W. Zhao J. Devi L.A. Pei G. Ma L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The DOR3D mutant receptor was localized predominantly in the plasma membrane and exhibited minimal internalization in the absence of agonist, as visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 B) and confirmed by the biotin protection assay (Fig. 1 C). However, in contrast to the DOR5A mutant receptor, the DOR3D mutant receptor exhibited readily detectable internalization after addition of agonist (Fig. 1,B and C) even though this receptor was not detectably phosphorylated (Fig. 1 A). These observations suggest that phosphorylation of the distal portion of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of DOR, although not sufficient to promote endocytosis of full-length receptors in the absence of agonist, is necessary to relieve the inhibitory effect of this cytoplasmic domain on endocytosis of receptors after agonist-induced activation.Phosphorylation stimulates endocytosis of many GPCRs, including opioid receptors, by promoting receptor interaction with β-arrestins (15Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar,16Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This suggests that the distal cytoplasmic tail of DOR, when not phosphorylated, might mediate its inhibitory effects on r"

When the ternary Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) complex composed of Cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1 was used as bait, the xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) D helicase of transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), among other proteins, was identified as an interacting partner. Deletion mutant analyses demonstrated that the coiled-coil and the hydrophobic domains of MAT1 interlink the CAK complex directly with the N-terminal domain of XPD. Using immunoprecipitates from cells coinfected with baculoviruses, we further validated the bridging function of XPD, which anchors CAK to the core TFIIH. In addition we show that upon interaction with MAT1, CAK inhibits the helicase activity of XPD. This inhibition is overcome upon binding to p44, a subunit of the core TFIIH. It is not surprising that under these conditions some XPD mutations affect interactions not only with p44, but also with MAT1, thus preventing either the CAK inhibitory function within CAK·XPD and/or the role of CAK within TFIIH and, consequently, explaining the variety of the XP phenotypes.

J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), TFIID1 (2Bell B. Tora L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH (3Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M. Vermeulen W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 4Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 20: 346-350Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar), or the mediator complexes (5Lee Y.C. Min S. Gim B.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4622-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) are involved in transcription initiation. To ensure that these complexes work properly, it seems likely that they might be regulated by other cellular components. These regulations may involve subtle and weak interactions between partners that are hardly detectable with classical methods such as the yeast two-hybrid system or immunoprecipitation using one partner as bait. To further understand the internal interactions within these large complexes and/or to identify the externally interacting partner(s), we theorize that the bait should be a multiprotein complex. In such a case, the target protein would recognize a specific structure displayed by the subunits of the complex used as bait. This multipoint surface will likely increase and stabilize the interaction between the target protein to be characterized and the bait. The transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH is a complex enzyme composed of nine subunits, three of which (XPB, XPD, and Cdk7) have identified enzymatic activities (6Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Once recruited either by the stable transcription preinitiation complex or by the damage recognition complex, the XPB and XPD helicases of TFIIH induce the opening of the DNA around the transcription start site and the lesion, respectively (6Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 7Evans E. Moggs J.G. Hwang J.R. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6559-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 8Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Nat.

Interestingly, mutations in these two proteins affect some of the enzymatic activities of TFIIH and give rise to three autosomal recessive genetic disorders, Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy, the corresponding phenotypes of which are rather complex and diverse (10Hoeijmakers J.H. Eur. J. Cancer. 1994; 13: 1912-1921Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Lehmann A.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This prompted us to hypothesize that disruption of these enzymatic activities contributes to the observed phenotypes and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms. We have focused our attention on the Cdkactivating kinase complex (CAK), part of TFIIH. Several studies have detailed the role of Cdk7, part of CAK, which also contains cyclin H and MAT1 (12Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 13Yankulov K. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Indeed, Cdk7 phosphorylates both RNA polymerase II, likely favoring the transition from initiation to elongation (14Usheva A. Maldonado E. Goldring A. Lu H. Houbavi C. Reinberg D. Aloni J. Cell. 1992; 69: 871-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 15Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23352-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and some DNA-binding proteins such as nuclear receptors, which activate their responsive genes (16Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Bastien J. Adam-Stitah S. Riedl T. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21896-21904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, free CAK phosphorylates and thus regulates proteins that are involved in the cell cycle (18Kaldis P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Riedl T. Egly J.M. Gene Expr. 2000; 9: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Keriel A. Egly J.M. Kaldis P. The CDK-activating Kinase (CAK). Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2001Google Scholar). To investigate the role of CAK in transcription, DNA repair, and cell cycle, we developed a yeast four-hybrid system. Knowing that the ternary CAK complex can be stably assembled, we used CAK as bait for a fourth partner, which would be detected upon screening a cDNA library. We first validated this new assay by showing that the cDNA library screening identifies the XPD helicase and part of TFIIH as well as FIR (far upstream element-binding protein-interacting repressor), a protein involved in the regulation of c-Myc gene expression (21Liu J. He L. Collins I. Ge H. Libutti D. Li J. Egly J.-M. Levens D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, we identified other proteins connected with transcription gene regulation, too, which will be further investigated. Coexpression experiments in baculovirus-infected cells demonstrated that XPD interlinks CAK mainly via the coiled-coil domain of MAT1 to the core TFIIH via the p44 subunit. We show further that CAK inhibits the helicase activity of XPD until incorporation into TFIIH, as illustrated by the release of the inhibition when p44 is present. This allowed us to understand TFIIH architecture, explain some XPD phenotypes, and design strategies for crystallographic studies. All yeast methods such as media composition, transformation, and selection were performed as described (22Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The L40 strain (MATa, trp1, his3, ade2, leu2, LYS::(LexAop)4-HIS3,URA3::(LexAop)8-lacZ) was used (23Holstege F.C. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Lift filter assay and liquid β-Gal assays were performed as described previously (24Sandrock B. Tirode F. Egly J.M. MacDonald P.N. Methods in Molecular Biology: Two-hybrid System: Methods and Protocols. 177. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 271-289Google Scholar). pLex9-Cdk7/Met-25-cyclin H, and pVP16-XPD were described previously (25Tirode F. Malaguti C. Romero F. Attar R. Camonis J. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22995-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For pXPD-VP16, the cDNA of XPD was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the sense primer 5′-GCGAAGCTTATGAAGCTCAACGTGGAC-3′ (primer 1) and the antisense primer 5′-GATGCTCGAGTTGAGCTGCTGAGCAATCTGC-3′ (primer 2), digested with HindIII and XhoI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pVP16. pXPDN-VP16 was made by using primer 1 and the antisense primer 5′-GTACCTCGAGCTGAAGTGCAGGATGGG-3′. For pXPDC-VP16 we used the sense primer 5′-GTACAAGCTTATGATCCTGCACTTCAGCTGC-3′ and primer 2. The XPD mutants R112H, D234N, and G602D were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers 1 and 2 of the clones pACter-R112H, pACter-D234N, and pACter-G602D, used for baculovirus transfection, 2S. Dubaele, unpublished results. pYEA was made by replacing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HIS3 gene from YEp90 (26Gaudon C. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2229-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) through the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADE2 gene. The cDNA of human MAT1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the sense primer 5′-CGATGAATTCATGGACGATCAGGGTTGC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GATACAGGAATTCTTAACTGGGCTGCCAGAA-3′. After digestion withEcoRI, the MAT1 fragment was cloned in the EcoRI site of pYEA to obtain pYEA-MAT1. The pYEA-MAT1 mutants MAT1-(1–66), MAT1-(67–189), MAT1-(191–309), and MAT1-(67–309) were derived by insertion of the corresponding fragments obtained throughEcoRI digestion from the pVP16 clones described elsewhere (27Busso D.

All constructs described above were sequenced. PLexA-derived constructs allow selection on tryptophan-lacking medium, pYEA constructs on adenine-lacking medium, and pVP16 constructs on leucine-lacking medium. For library screening a Matchmaker cDNA library derived from HeLa cell mRNA (CLONTECH) was used. The transformation of the library was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were grown on medium lacking tryptophan, adenine, leucine and histidine (TALH medium) containing 20 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, a suppressor of nonspecific HIS3 expression. After 8–10 days, colonies larger than 2 mm in diameter were collected (∼500) and restreaked on the same medium. 109 clones that re-grew were analyzed in liquid β-Gal assays. XPD, Cdk7, cyclin H, MAT1, and p44 were overexpressed in Sf9 cells, and protein extracts were prepared as described elsewhere (6Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol.

After equilibration to 50 mm KCl, one-half of the beads was used for the helicase assay and the other for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis as described elsewhere (8Coin F.

The reconstitution of a quaternary complex in a yeast four-hybrid system should lead, as in the yeast two- or three-hybrid systems (25Tirode F. Malaguti C. Romero F. Attar R. Camonis J. Egly J.M. J.

We took advantage of the fact that CAK is a very stable ternary complex containing Cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1 (29Devault A. Martinez A.M. Fesquet D. Labbé J.C. Morin N. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A.

Therefore one protein partner is fused to a DNA binding domain (here, LexA-Cdk7), which recognizes a specific upstream sequence in the promoter of the reporter gene. Another partner is fused to the activation domain (here, X-VP16), which will interact with the basal transcription machinery. The direct (two-hybrid) or the mediated (three- or four-hybrid) interaction between these two fusion proteins then allows the growth of the yeast on histidine-lacking medium and the detection of β-galactosidase activity. Thus, the two other partners of Cdk7 within CAK, cyclin H and MAT1, should be expressed independently from the two fusion proteins. Cyclin H was from the conditional expression vector pLex9-Cdk7/Met-25-cyclin H. MAT1 was under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter in the plasmid pYEA-MAT1. It has to be pointed out that the Met-25 promoter, which regulates the expression of cyclin H, also serves as a control for checking the specificity of the quaternary complex assembly. Indeed, the Met-25 promoter, which is active under normal medium conditions, can be repressed in the presence of methionine, thus preventing the formation of the quaternary complex and consequently the reporter gene expression (Fig. 1 B). We have sequentially transformed the L40 yeast strain with the plasmids pLex9-Cdk7/Met-25-cyclin H and pYEA-MAT1. Using the ternary CAK complex (including Cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1) as bait, we then screened a cDNA library derived from HeLa cell mRNA fused to the VP16 activation domain. Double screening of the yeast transformants (1.5 million) by plating on TALH medium gave 109 clones that were positive in the liquid β-Gal assay. Eighteen of the clones with the highest β-Gal activities have been sequenced. To our surprise we identified the XPD helicase, a subunit of the core-TFIIH (6Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol.

As listed in Table I, we also found some other proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression (HSP60, hoxC10, pRB-binding protein II, polypeptide elongation factor 1a (eEF-1), FIR, or SR splicing factor). In addition, we have identified two different proteasome subunits and the calcium-dependent protease as members of diverse degradation pathways as well as two still unknown proteins. Up to now only FIR has been shown to interact with TFIIH, resulting in the repression of promoter escape of RNA polymerase II, which was activated before by FUSE-binding protein) (21Liu J. He L.

These findings fit with previous reports and validate our assay in which a ternary complex can be used as bait to screen for interacting partners.Table IcDNAs identified in the library screeningcDNANo. of clonesβ-GalXPD1100HoxC101120FIR379pRB-binding protein II355Proteasome subunit152Polypeptide elongation factor 1a (eEF-1)247Calcium-dependent protease147SR splicing factor129Proteasome subunit228HSP60 (heat shock protein)125Unknown A5139Unknown B21122VP162The names of the cDNAs identified in the yeast four-hybrid screen are listed together with the number of clones and the β-Gal activity (XPD = 100%). Open table in a new tab The names of the cDNAs identified in the yeast four-hybrid screen are listed together with the number of clones and the β-Gal activity (XPD = 100%). To further validate our assay, we investigated how the XPD helicase interacts with CAK. Therefore expression vectors in which the activating VP16 domain was fused either to the C terminus (XPD-VP16) or to the N terminus (VP16-XPD) of XPD were constructed (Fig. 2 B). Yeast cells were sequentially transformed with the combination of expression vectors as indicated at the bottom of Fig. 2 A. We then performed liquid β-Gal assays in the absence or the presence of methionine on clones growing on TAL medium. In the presence of VP16-XPD, no lacZ gene expression occurs, indicating that the availability of the XPD N-terminal moiety is crucial for the formation of the CAK·XPD complex (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 3). Moreover, when either Cdk7 or MAT1 are not expressed, no β-Gal is synthesized (compare lane 1 withlanes 5 and 7, respectively). Taken together these results indicate that the presence of CAK is necessary for the reconstitution of the transcriptional activator. Finally, in the presence of 1 mm methionine, the expression of cyclin H is inhibited, and therefore, the activity of the lacZ gene product is significantly reduced (lane 2). However, the weak β-Gal synthesis observed in our assay could result from the formation of very unstable Cdk7·MAT1·XPD complexes since MAT1 weakly interacts with Cdk7 or XPD (25Tirode F. Malaguti C.

Gileadi O. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22815-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Since the XPD helicase is one of the major players in NER, and XPD mutations lead to XP, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy diseases, we investigated which part of XPD targets CAK. Three-dimensional models of the XPD structure designed from the structure of UVRB (37Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) 3R. Bienstock and B. van Houtten, personal communication. show that XPD can be divided into two domains, the N-terminal domain, which includes three helicase elements (Fig.3 A), and the C-terminal domain, in which 80% of the mutations seen in XPD patients are located (11Lehmann A.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 38Taylor E. Broughton B. Botta E. Stefanini M. Sarasin A. Jaspers N. Fawcett H. Harcourt S. Arlett C. Lehmann A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8658-8663Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Some of them weaken the interaction with p44, thereby inhibiting the XPD helicase activity of the holo-TFIIH (8Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed two XPD deletion mutants (Fig. 2 B), one containing the N-terminal half with the central part (amino acids 1–436, XPDN-VP16) and the other containing the C-terminal half of XPD (amino acids 431–760, XPDC-VP16). XPDN-VP16 and XPDC-VP16 proteins were then expressed together with the CAK subunits in the L40 yeast strain. XPDC-VP16, which lacks the 1–430 N-terminal moiety of XPD, prevents the formation of the quaternary complex, whereas XPDN-VP16 allows β-Gal synthesis (Fig. 2 A, lanes 13 and11, respectively). Nevertheless, it has to be pointed out that truncation of the C-terminal part of XPD partially affects the optimal gene expression induction (around 70% compared with XPD-wild type), underlying the importance of a well preserved XPD architecture. We then wondered if some mutations found within XPD patients (38Taylor E. Broughton B. Botta E. Stefanini M. Sarasin A. Jaspers N. Fawcett H. Harcourt S. Arlett C. Lehmann A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8658-8663Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) would affect the formation of the CAK-XPD and, therefore, the TFIIH transcription and/or DNA repair activity. Fused expression vectors bearing XPD mutations identical to those found in three patients (R112H (39Stefanini M. Giliani S. Nardo T. Marinoni S. Nazzaro V. Rizzo R. Trevisan G. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), G602D (40Takayama K. Salazar E.P. Lehmann A. Stefanini M. Thompson L.H. Weber C.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5656-5663PubMed Google Scholar), and D234N (41Ichihashi M. Yamamura K. Hiramoto T. Fujiwara Y. Arch. Dermatol. 1988; 124: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) were designed (Fig. 3 A). These hybrid mutants were expressed in yeast together with Cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1. Lift-filter assays combined with liquid β-Gal assays demonstrated that XPD-R112H as well as XPD-D234N weaken the binding capacity of XPD for the CAK complex (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and4). Together these data suggest that the N-terminal domain of XPD is targeted by CAK and that some XPD phenotypes could be due to a defect in these interactions. It is, however, interesting to note that the XPD-G602D mutation results in a 40% drop of β-Gal activity, meaning that this mutation, which is not involved in the XPD/p44-interacting domain, 4B. Sandrock, and J.-M. Egly, unpublished data. affects CAK·XPD interaction (8Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 42Seroz T. Perez C. Bergmann E. Bradsher J. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33260-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Having demonstrated (Fig.2 A, lane 7) that the expression of MAT1 is crucial for the formation of the CAK-XPD, we asked which parts of MAT1 were critical interaction domains. MAT1 can be subdivided into three regions (27Busso D. Keriel A. Sandrock B. Poterszman A. Gileadi O. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22815-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the N-terminal ring finger (MAT1-(1–66)) domain, the coiled-coil (MAT1-(67–189)) domain, and the C-terminal hydrophobic (MAT1-(191–309)) domain. None of these three domains, when transfected with those expressing Cdk7, cyclin H, and XPD, allow synthesis of β-Gal (Fig. 4, lanes 1–5) and, therefore, are not sufficient to promote the formation of the quaternary complex. On the other hand, when fused together, the coiled-coil domain and the hydrophobic C terminus of MAT1 (MAT1-(67–309)) lead to β-Gal activity comparable with that of the entire MAT1 (lanes 1 and 6). It should be noted that MAT1-(67–309) and the truncated XPDN-VP16 together with LexA-Cdk7 and cyclin H are still able to partially reconstitute the transcriptional activator (lane 7). This demonstrates that some motifs in the C-terminal part of XPD are also necessary for the CAK complex assembly, a point already suggested by transfection using XPD-G602D mutant (Fig. 3, lane 3). To further understand the architecture of TFIIH and especially that of the CAK·XPD subcomplex, we coinfected insect cells with baculoviruses overexpressing XPD in combination with the various subunits of CAK and p44, as indicated at the top of Fig. 5 A. When CAK is overexpressed with XPD, antibodies directed either against Cdk7 or XPD immunoprecipitate all four subunits (Fig. 5 A,lanes 2, 5, and 17). This interaction mainly occurs through the binding of MAT1 to XPD (lane 13) and is maintained by the binding of the two other subunits of CAK (lanes 16 and 17) or the p44 subunit (lane 15). In addition, immunoprecipitations with antibodies directed against Cdk7, p44, or XPD reveal a CAK·XPD·p44 complex. Note that each complex contains stoichiometric amounts of each subunit (lanes 6, 9, and 18). This strongly shows that CAK anchoring to the core TFIIH is mediated by XPD, which binds MAT1 on one side, with p44 on the other. We then asked what could be the biological significance of these interactions. The main role of XPD in transcription and DNA repair is the 5′-3′ unwinding of the DNA around either the start site or the DNA damage, respectively, an activity that was shown to be stimulated by p44 (8Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of CAK on XPD, we prepared coinfected baculovirus protein extracts and performed immunoprecipitations with AbXPD antibodies against XPD-containing complexes. The helicase activity of these complexes was analyzed directly on the beads (8Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). As expected, the 5′-3′ XPD helicase is stimulated by p44 (Fig.5 A, lanes 12 and 14). To our surprise, the addition of CAK to XPD substantially diminishes the XPD helicase activity (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3–5). Interestingly, this inhibition occurs upon interaction with MAT1 either alone (Fig.5 A, lane 13), carried by cyclin H (lane 16) or carried by cyclin H together with Cdk7 (lane 17). More importantly, this inhibition by MAT1 is relieved (or prevented) when p44 is present (compare lanes 13,15, and 18). It is also worth mentioning that when p44 is bound to XPD, CAK does not inhibit the XPD helicase activity (Fig. 5 B, lanes 6–8). This explains why within TFIIH, XPD exhibits its optimal activity. In the course of this study we have designed a yeast four-hybrid system using a ternary complex as bait to screen any cDNA library. Under these conditions, the target protein recognizes the ternary complex more specifically through multipoint attachment. Our system, which uses the CAK complex as bait, also possesses its own internal control since, when one of the partner (cyclin H) is not expressed, the ternary complex cannot be formed. In addition to the improvement of both the specificity and the strength of the interaction, this assay is also flexible for additional approaches; it can be used to analyze structural proteins (MAT1) or to screen for either bridging proteins of a complex or inhibitors, which hinder complex formation (25Tirode F. Malaguti C. Romero F. Attar R. Camonis J. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22995-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This assay, which could be adapted once a ternary protein complex has been identified, was in fact set up to investigate the role of the Cdk-activating kinase CAK and its putative target proteins. A cDNA screening for CAK-interacting partners with the four-hybrid system has identified two proteins among others that have already been described as targets for CAK, the FIR protein (21Liu J. He L. Collins I. Ge H. Libutti D. Li J. Egly J.-M. Levens D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and the XPD helicase (12Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 32Drapkin R. Le Roy G. Cho H. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This validates this highly specific method to screen and analyze multiprotein complexes. Because only the expression of VP16 fused to the C terminus of the target protein (XPD-VP16) allows formation of the activator (Fig. 2 A), our system further points out how each library screening can fail to identify all possible interacting partners. It was demonstrated that in HeLa cell protein extracts the CAK as well as CAK·XPD complexes exist in addition to TFIIH (12Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 31Adamczewski J.P. Rossignol M. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Moncollin V. Egly J.M.

A. 1996; 93: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Together with previous work (27Busso D. Keriel A. Sandrock B. Poterszman A. Gileadi O. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22815-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) we have now definitively established that XPD bridges p44, a subunit of the core TFIIH to the MAT1 subunit of CAK. However it is unclear what the biological significance of CAK·XPD complexes is in DNA repair and transcription. Our study now shows how XPD, which possesses a helicase activity, is switched off upon interaction with MAT1, thus rendering the CAK·XPD complex unable to unwind DNA. The ability to switch off XPD avoids the deregulated helicase activity of XPD apart from its activity in TFIIH, which could lead to the unwinding of any DNA not linked to proper transcription and repair reactions. Upon binding to the XPD subunit of CAK·XPD, p44 not only counteracts the repressive effect of MAT1 but also stimulates the XPD helicase activity. Moreover, our data allow us to hypothesize that whether or not CAK·XPD exists free in the cell, it recovers its helicase activity only once it associates with the core TFIIH. The inhibition, which can be due to some conformational changes induced by MAT1, which may mask either the DNA and/or the ATP binding site of XPD, can be circumvented by p44. It is thus likely that some mutations in XPD might affect not only its binding to p44, leading to the appearance of XP phenotype, but also to MAT1. Indeed, a weaker interaction between XPD and MAT1 (and consequently CAK) will not disturb the XPD activity within TFIIH but rather the kinase activity of CAK toward substrates such as RNA polymerase II and/or nuclear receptors (6Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 16Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P.

With respect to this, the recent observation that adult knock-out mice are viable in the absence of MAT1 needs to be clarified (46Rossi D.J. Londesborough A. Korsisaari N. Pihlak A. Lehtonen E. Henkemeyer M. Makela T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2844-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study MAT1 has been described to be essential for early embryonic development for the formation of trophoblast giant cells. This is due to the inability of trophoectodermal cells to enter the S phase and not due to a general transcriptional defect, although hormone-regulated genes have not been analyzed. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined if a CAK-XPD complex is not only switched off in its helicase activity but also in its kinase activity. The present study also sheds light on the structure of TFIIH. A MAT1·XPD·p44 complex is a kind of hinge of the TFIIH complex around which the other subunits are organized (Fig.6). The N-terminal part of XPD mainly binds the coiled-coil domain of MAT1 subunit of the CAK complex, whereas its C terminus is integrated via the N-terminal part of p44 in the core-TFIIH. Cdk7 and cyclin H are the outermost subunits of holo-TFIIH and are stabilized by MAT1 via its hydrophobic domain. Tfb3, the yeast counterpart of MAT1, has been shown to be part of the core yTFIIH rather than TFIIK, which contains only Kin28/Cdk7 and Ccl1/cyclin H. Tfb3 has as a privileged partner Rad3, the XPD ortholog, and has been shown to interact with Kin28 in yeast two-hybrid assays (47Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A.

Therefore the architecture of MAT1/Tfb3 fits perfectly with TFIIH electron microscopy image (49Schultz P. Fribourg S. Poterszman A. Mallouh V. Moras D. Egly J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 599-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and seems to be similar in yeast and human TFIIH even if the relative affinities between the subunits have been evolved differently. Finally this model may provide useful information that can be used for further investigations on crystals derived from some but not all subunits of the TFIIH multiprotein complex.

The HGF-mediated association of Gab1 with either full-length GST-p85 or its isolated N- or C-terminal SH2 domains was inhibited by ∼50% in the setting of ERK inhibition, a result confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of the native proteins. A 14-amino acid peptide encoding472YVPMTP477 (one of the major p85 binding sites in Gab1 and the predicted ERK phosphorylation site) was synthesized with either phosphotyrosine alone (pY), or phosphotyrosine + phosphothreonine (pYT). In both pull-down assays and competition assays, pYT demonstrated a higher affinity for p85 than did pY alone. Finally, examination of the phosphorylation state of Akt after HGF stimulation revealed that ERK inhibition resulted in a decrease in Akt activation at both 5 and 10 min. These results suggest that activated ERK can phosphorylate Gab1 in response to HGF stimulation and thereby potentiate the Gab1/PI3K association and subsequent PI3K activation.

These proteins form an intricate signaling complex that regulates cell migration, morphology, and tubule formation. The critical nature of Gab1 signaling in normal cell biology has been demonstrated by the finding that Gab1-deficient mice die in utero (7Itoh M. Yoshida Y. Nishida K. Narimatsu M. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3695-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and display developmental defects in myotomes, placenta, and liver that recapitulate the loss of HGF and c-Met (8Sachs M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).The phenotypic effects of Gab1 signaling have been found to be critically dependent on Gab1 interactions with the PI3K. The PI3K is a heterodimer composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). Two SH2 domains are located in the C-terminal region of the p85 subunit and have been shown to bind to membrane-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, resulting in recruitment of the PI3K to the membrane and activation of the lipid kinase activity of the 110-kDa subunit. This activity results in the formation of phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI3,4,5P3) at the membrane, which in turn serves to recruit and help activate such proteins as protein kinase C (PKC) and Akt (9Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Downward J. Curr.

The activated PI3K has been demonstrated to result in the regulation of various cellular activities including proliferation (11Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E.

We have found that PI3K activity is critical for c-Met-mediated cell migration and in vitro tubulogenesis (14Derman M.P. Cunha M.J. Barros E.J. Nigam S.K. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar), at least in part by activating PKC (15Derman M. Toker A. Hartwig J. Spokes K. Falck J. Chen C.-S. Cantley L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6465-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Another role for PI3K in morphogenic signaling has been demonstrated by the observation that the PH domain of Gab1 binds PI3,4,5P3, which serves to recruit Gab1 to the membrane following PI3K activation (1Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 16Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Loss of the PH domain of Gab1 results in loss of epithelial morphogenesis following HGF stimulation, despite recruitment of Gab1 to the c-Met receptor and its phosphorylation (16Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).We have recently demonstrated that in addition to SH2 and SH3 domain containing proteins, Gab1 also interacts with phosphorylated ERK1 and 2 following HGF or EGF stimulation of epithelial cells (18Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The association of ERK with Gab1 results in the phosphorylation of Gab1 on serine and threonine residues, primarily in the Met binding domain (MBD). This domain also includes one of three major consensus sequences for PI3K binding (472YVPM475), as well as a predicted ERK phosphorylation site immediately adjacent (472YVPMTP477). We therefore hypothesized that ERK phosphorylation of this site in vivomight result in secondary regulation of p85 SH2 domain binding to Gab1. In the present study, we confirm that HGF stimulation results in Gab1-p85 association, and demonstrate that this interaction is partly dependent on ERK activation. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of ERK activation not only decreases the association of p85 with Gab1 but also decreases the downstream phosphorylation of Akt.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we demonstrate that the addition of HGF to cells expressing the c-Met receptor results in both tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 as well as a decrease in the gel mobility of Gab1. The appearance of a slower mobility on SDS gels is typical of proteins that undergo phosphorylation on serine or threonine residues, particularly in the motif SP or TP. This is apparently because phosphorylation at these sites causes a change in the tertiary structure of the protein by creating a binding site for peptidyl-prolylcis/trans isomerases such as Pin1 (25Schutkowski M. Bernhardt A. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Reimer U. Rahfeld J.U. Lu K.P. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5566-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 29Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we had found that the serine/threonine kinase ERK interacted with the MBD of Gab1 directly and could phosphorylate Gab lin vitro and in vivo resulting in an indistinguishable reduction in gel mobility (18Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistent with this data, we now show that inhibition of ERK activation prevents the HGF-mediated decrease in Gab1 gel mobility, arguing that ERK may directly phosphorylate Gab1 following HGF stimulation.ERK typically phosphorylates proteins at the motif PX(S/T)P (30Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), often followed closely by an ERK binding motif consisting of FXFP (32Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Examining the sequence of Gab1 using the ScanSite program reveals one site in the Gab1 sequence that closely fits this preferred motif,472YVPMTPGTFDFS484. This site is in the Met binding domain (MBD) of Gab1, an 82-amino acid region of the protein that mediates the interaction of c-Met and Gab1 (2Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), which we have shown to selectively mediate ERK association and to be phosphorylated preferentially by ERK in vitro (18Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this ERK phosphorylation site is embedded in the classic PI3K SH2 association site, YVPM, and mutation of the tyrosine residue in this site has been shown to markedly decrease PI3K binding (26Schaeper U. Gehring N.H. Fuchs K.P. Sachs M. Kempkes B. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 33Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This suggests that ERK phosphorylation of this site might regulate the interaction of Gab1 and the PI3K.To test the role of endogenous ERK in the Gab1-PI3K association, we examined the ability of the p85 subunit of the PI3K to associate with Gab1 following HGF stimulation in the presence or absence of ERK inhibition. As expected, stimulation with HGF resulted in a marked increase in the affinity of p85 for Gab1, both in GST-p85 pull-down experiments and in co-immunoprecipitation of the native proteins. This increased affinity of Gab1 for p85 was reproduced equally for both the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of p85, demonstrating its requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of the Gab1 protein. However, pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 resulted in a substantial decrease in the p85-Gab1 interaction in both the pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that ERK phosphorylation of Gab1 increases the affinity of Gab1 for p85. This result was unexpected, because ERK-mediated serine phosphorylation of the structurally similar docking protein, IRS-1, was found to have an opposite effect (34De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).In the case of IRS-1, phosphorylation by several serine/threonine kinases, including ERK, PKC, and Akt, has been shown to decrease the affinity of IRS-1 for p85, at least in some cases by decreasing tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (34De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 35De Fea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12939-12947Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 36Li J. DeFea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9351-9356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Because the predicted ERK phosphorylation site in Gab1 is in the Met binding domain, we examined the possibility that inhibition of ERK activation was altering the association of c-Met and Gab1 and subsequently the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Gab1. We did not detect a difference in the association between Gab1 and its c-Met adapter protein Grb2, nor did we find a change in the total tyrosine phosphorylation state of Gab1 following HGF stimulation in the presence or absence of MEK inhibition. Thus it does not appear that treatment with U0126 prevents HGF-mediated c-Met activation or c-Met-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1. Of note, because Gab1 is known to be potentially phosphorylated on at least 8 tyrosine residues (37Lehr S. Kotzka J. Herkner A. Klein E. Siethoff C. Knebel B. Noelle V. Bruning J.C. Klein H.W. Meyer H.E. Krone W. Muller-Wieland D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a selective loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of one of the residues critical for p85 association might not be detected by this method.To determine whether phosphorylation of threonine 476 (the predicted ERK phosphorylation site in Gab1) alters the affinity of tyrosine 472 (the most important residue for p85 binding to Gab1 (33Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)) for binding the SH2 domain of p85, three peptides based on the 14 amino acids encompassing this site were synthesized. As expected, the non-phosphorylated peptide failed to interact with p85, whereas pY472 pulled-down p85 at concentrations as low as 1 pm. However, in both simple pull-down experiments and competition experiments using the native p85 biding site in the PDGFR, the dual-phosphorylated peptide (pYT) displayed a higher affinity for p85 than did pY. Thus, dual phosphorylation on both tyrosine and threonine at the predicted ERK phosphorylation site in Gab1 results in a higher affinity for p85 binding than does tyrosine phosphorylation alone. The antibody used in these experiments can recognize both p85α and β, and the association of these isoforms with Gab1 is not well distinguished using the gel separation techniques presented. Therefore the association of either p85α, p85β, or both may be up-regulated in this setting. Conversely, the dual phosphorylation of Gab1 could result in a decreased affinity of Gab1 for an independent PI3K regulatory isoform such as p55.To test whether this proposed dual phosphorylation of Gab1 actually results in an alteration in PI3K downstream signaling, we examined the effects of inhibition of ERK activation on Akt phosphorylation. Akt is a PH domain containing serine/threonine kinase that is recruited to the membrane by the PI3K product PI3,4,5P3 where it is phosphorylated and activated by the membrane-associated kinase PDK1, resulting in enhanced cell survival (28Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar). Using an antibody specific for the activated state of Akt (anti-pT308), we found that activated Akt was detectable within 2 min following HGF stimulation. In the absence of U0126 treatment, the phosphorylation state of Akt increased further at 5 and 10 min, consistent with a further increase in PI3,4,5P3 production at the membrane. In the setting of ERK inhibition, the initial increase in phospho-Akt was not altered, but the subsequent further increase at 5 and 10 min was entirely abolished.Taken together, these data are most consistent with the model that c-Met activation results in Gab1 recruitment to the receptor followed by phosphorylation of Gab1 at multiple tyrosine residues, including472YVPM475. This results in association of PI3K with Gab1 and local production of PI3,4,5P3. In concert, HGF induces ERK activation with the subsequent association of Gab1 and ERK resulting in phosphorylation of Gab1 at Thr476in the PI3K docking site. This dually phosphorylated motif then can act as a higher affinity site for the p85 subunit of the PI3K, leading to a further recruitment and/or stabilization of PI3K at the membrane and subsequently greater activation of PI3,4,5P3-dependent signaling pathways. The increase in Akt phosphorylation observed in the absence of ERK inhibition suggests yet another pathway whereby ERK activation may help promote cell survival and prevent apoptosis.In conclusion, the HGF-mediated interaction of Gab1 and PI3K is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation by the c-Met receptor, but is further enhanced by ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Gab1, possibly at Thr476. Threonine phosphorylation at this site results in a higher affinity of the PI3K binding site472YVPMTP477 for p85, whereas inhibition of ERK activation decreased the p85 association with Gab1 and decreased the activation of the downstream kinase Akt. Because activation of the PI3K is critical for epithelial cell migration and morphogenesis, this result may in part explain our prior observations that HGF-mediated epithelial cell migration and tubule formation are dependent on MAPK activation (22Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The docking protein Gab1 associates with several receptor tyrosine kinases known to induce cell morphogenesis, including the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)1receptor, c-Met, and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Following receptor activation, Gab1 associates and is tyrosine-phosphorylated, in turn recruiting multiple SH2 domain containing signal transducing proteins such as SHC, SHP2, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Crk/CRKL, and phospholipase Cγ (1Holgado-Madruga M.

Bernhardt A. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Reimer U. Rahfeld J.U. Lu K.P. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5566-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 29Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we had found that the serine/threonine kinase ERK interacted with the MBD of Gab1 directly and could phosphorylate Gab lin vitro and in vivo resulting in an indistinguishable reduction in gel mobility (18Roshan B.

Consistent with this data, we now show that inhibition of ERK activation prevents the HGF-mediated decrease in Gab1 gel mobility, arguing that ERK may directly phosphorylate Gab1 following HGF stimulation.ERK typically phosphorylates proteins at the motif PX(S/T)P (30Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), often followed closely by an ERK binding motif consisting of FXFP (32Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Examining the sequence of Gab1 using the ScanSite program reveals one site in the Gab1 sequence that closely fits this preferred motif,472YVPMTPGTFDFS484. This site is in the Met binding domain (MBD) of Gab1, an 82-amino acid region of the protein that mediates the interaction of c-Met and Gab1 (2Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), which we have shown to selectively mediate ERK association and to be phosphorylated preferentially by ERK in vitro (18Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this ERK phosphorylation site is embedded in the classic PI3K SH2 association site, YVPM, and mutation of the tyrosine residue in this site has been shown to markedly decrease PI3K binding (26Schaeper U. Gehring N.H. Fuchs K.P. Sachs M. Kempkes B. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 33Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This suggests that ERK phosphorylation of this site might regulate the interaction of Gab1 and the PI3K.To test the role of endogenous ERK in the Gab1-PI3K association, we examined the ability of the p85 subunit of the PI3K to associate with Gab1 following HGF stimulation in the presence or absence of ERK inhibition. As expected, stimulation with HGF resulted in a marked increase in the affinity of p85 for Gab1, both in GST-p85 pull-down experiments and in co-immunoprecipitation of the native proteins. This increased affinity of Gab1 for p85 was reproduced equally for both the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of p85, demonstrating its requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of the Gab1 protein. However, pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 resulted in a substantial decrease in the p85-Gab1 interaction in both the pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that ERK phosphorylation of Gab1 increases the affinity of Gab1 for p85. This result was unexpected, because ERK-mediated serine phosphorylation of the structurally similar docking protein, IRS-1, was found to have an opposite effect (34De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).In the case of IRS-1, phosphorylation by several serine/threonine kinases, including ERK, PKC, and Akt, has been shown to decrease the affinity of IRS-1 for p85, at least in some cases by decreasing tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (34De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 35De Fea K. Roth R.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9351-9356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Because the predicted ERK phosphorylation site in Gab1 is in the Met binding domain, we examined the possibility that inhibition of ERK activation was altering the association of c-Met and Gab1 and subsequently the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Gab1. We did not detect a difference in the association between Gab1 and its c-Met adapter protein Grb2, nor did we find a change in the total tyrosine phosphorylation state of Gab1 following HGF stimulation in the presence or absence of MEK inhibition. Thus it does not appear that treatment with U0126 prevents HGF-mediated c-Met activation or c-Met-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1. Of note, because Gab1 is known to be potentially phosphorylated on at least 8 tyrosine residues (37Lehr S. Kotzka J. Herkner A. Klein E. Siethoff C. Knebel B. Noelle V. Bruning J.C. Klein H.W. Meyer H.E. Krone W. Muller-Wieland D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a selective loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of one of the residues critical for p85 association might not be detected by this method.To determine whether phosphorylation of threonine 476 (the predicted ERK phosphorylation site in Gab1) alters the affinity of tyrosine 472 (the most important residue for p85 binding to Gab1 (33Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)) for binding the SH2 domain of p85, three peptides based on the 14 amino acids encompassing this site were synthesized. As expected, the non-phosphorylated peptide failed to interact with p85, whereas pY472 pulled-down p85 at concentrations as low as 1 pm. However, in both simple pull-down experiments and competition experiments using the native p85 biding site in the PDGFR, the dual-phosphorylated peptide (pYT) displayed a higher affinity for p85 than did pY. Thus, dual phosphorylation on both tyrosine and threonine at the predicted ERK phosphorylation site in Gab1 results in a higher affinity for p85 binding than does tyrosine phosphorylation alone. The antibody used in these experiments can recognize both p85α and β, and the association of these isoforms with Gab1 is not well distinguished using the gel separation techniques presented. Therefore the association of either p85α, p85β, or both may be up-regulated in this setting. Conversely, the dual phosphorylation of Gab1 could result in a decreased affinity of Gab1 for an independent PI3K regulatory isoform such as p55.To test whether this proposed dual phosphorylation of Gab1 actually results in an alteration in PI3K downstream signaling, we examined the effects of inhibition of ERK activation on Akt phosphorylation. Akt is a PH domain containing serine/threonine kinase that is recruited to the membrane by the PI3K product PI3,4,5P3 where it is phosphorylated and activated by the membrane-associated kinase PDK1, resulting in enhanced cell survival (28Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar). Using an antibody specific for the activated state of Akt (anti-pT308), we found that activated Akt was detectable within 2 min following HGF stimulation. In the absence of U0126 treatment, the phosphorylation state of Akt increased further at 5 and 10 min, consistent with a further increase in PI3,4,5P3 production at the membrane. In the setting of ERK inhibition, the initial increase in phospho-Akt was not altered, but the subsequent further increase at 5 and 10 min was entirely abolished.Taken together, these data are most consistent with the model that c-Met activation results in Gab1 recruitment to the receptor followed by phosphorylation of Gab1 at multiple tyrosine residues, including472YVPM475. This results in association of PI3K with Gab1 and local production of PI3,4,5P3. In concert, HGF induces ERK activation with the subsequent association of Gab1 and ERK resulting in phosphorylation of Gab1 at Thr476in the PI3K docking site. This dually phosphorylated motif then can act as a higher affinity site for the p85 subunit of the PI3K, leading to a further recruitment and/or stabilization of PI3K at the membrane and subsequently greater activation of PI3,4,5P3-dependent signaling pathways. The increase in Akt phosphorylation observed in the absence of ERK inhibition suggests yet another pathway whereby ERK activation may help promote cell survival and prevent apoptosis.In conclusion, the HGF-mediated interaction of Gab1 and PI3K is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation by the c-Met receptor, but is further enhanced by ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Gab1, possibly at Thr476. Threonine phosphorylation at this site results in a higher affinity of the PI3K binding site472YVPMTP477 for p85, whereas inhibition of ERK activation decreased the p85 association with Gab1 and decreased the activation of the downstream kinase Akt. Because activation of the PI3K is critical for epithelial cell migration and morphogenesis, this result may in part explain our prior observations that HGF-mediated epithelial cell migration and tubule formation are dependent on MAPK activation (22Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that the addition of HGF to cells expressing the c-Met receptor results in both tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 as well as a decrease in the gel mobility of Gab1.

Translocase consists of the SecYEG membrane protein complex, and the peripherally membrane-associated SecA dimer (for review, see Ref. 1Driessen A.J.M. Manting E.H. van der Does C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). SecA is an ATP-dependent motor protein that drives the stepwise translocation of the precursor protein (preprotein) across the membrane by cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis (2Schiebel E.

Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Recent electron microscopic and biochemical studies indicate that the protein conducting channel is composed of a SecYEG tetramer that is assembled by SecA from mono- and dimeric SecYEG subcomplexes (8Manting E.H. van der Does C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The SecYEG complex is a member of a highly conserved protein translocation pathway (9Pohlschroder M. Prinz W.A. Hartmann E. Beckwith J. Cell. 1997; 91: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is homologous to the eukaryotic Sec61p complex, which consists of three subunits, α, β, and γ, that together form the “translocon” of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (10Gorlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). SecY and SecE are essential subunits of the translocase. SecY comprises 10 transmembrane segments (TMSs)1 (Fig. 1), whereas SecE is a small membrane protein that in most bacteria contains only a single TMS. In Escherichia coli, SecE contains three TMSs, but only the conserved C-terminal portion including the third TMS is required for activity (11Schatz P.J. Bieker K.L. Ottemann K.M. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). SecY and SecE form a stable complex in the membrane that does not dissociate in vivo(12Joly J.C.

Many of the so-calledprl mutations (protein localization) that suppress defects in the signal sequence are present in thesecY and secE genes. Specific combinations of these mutations in SecY (prlA) and SecE (prlG) result in synthetic lethality, and it has been suggested that this signifies sites of interaction between SecY and SecE (16Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Flower A.M. Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, the periplasmic loop 1 (P1) of SecY and P2 of SecE are interacting regions, whereas TMS3 of SecE interacts with TMS7 and TMS10 of SecY. Recent studies employing cysteine mutagenesis indeed demonstrated that P1 of SecY and P2 of SecE (18Harris C.R. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3438-3444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TMS2 of SecY and TMS3 of SecE (19Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), are in close proximity. Most of the conserved residues and prlA mutations are clustered in TMSs 2, 7, and 10 of SecY, and together with TMS3 of SecE, they form the conserved core of the SecYE complex. Strikingly, the regions suggested to interact overlap with the regions that have been implicated in the binding of the signal sequence of the preprotein. TMS2 and TMS7 of Sec61α, the yeast homologue of SecY can be cross-linked to the signal sequence of a preprotein (20Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A.

Cysteine scanning mutagenesis also showed an interaction between two neighboring SecE molecules that is modulated by the SecA and ATP-dependent initiation of preprotein translocation (19Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This observation lends further support for an oligomeric nature of the integral membrane domain of the translocase. A central question is how the SecYEG complex forms the protein-conducting channel. Therefore, detailed information is required about the molecular architecture of the SecYEG complex. For this purpose, we have initiated a cysteine scanning mutagenesis approach to probe sites of interaction between SecY and SecE (19Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The method can also be used to detect dynamic changes in subunit interactions. To allow the formation of a disulfide bond, the β-carbons of the two cysteines need to be in close proximity, i.e. 3–4 Å (21Hazes B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We have now extended our studies to demonstrate that TMS3 of SecE forms an α-helix, with one face that stably interacts with TMS2 and TMS7 of SecY, whereas the opposite face dynamically interacts with TMS3 of a neighboring SecE molecule that is part of a separate SecYEG complex.

Double and triple cysteine mutants: the names are combined, e.g. pET2502/613 contains SecE V97C and SecY P276C mutations. Cell growth and isolation of inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) was performed as described previously (19Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For assays of disulfide bridge formation, IMVs (1 mg/ml) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm Cu2+(phenantroline)3(oxidized) or, as a control, with 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (reduced). The oxidation reaction was quenched by the addition of 25 mm neocuproine (Sigma). Oxidized samples were “re-reduced” by the incubation in 100 mm of DTT for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or further analyzed by Western blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and immunostaining using antibodies against His-tagged SecY or SecE (26van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Translocation reactions were performed as described before (19Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Translocation ATPase of urea-treated IMVs was measured with proOmpA as substrate (27Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of SDS using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Previously, we have described eight unique cysteine mutations that were introduced in TMS7 of SecY (Val-274 to Ser-281), covering at least two turns of the putative α-helical structure (25Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23868-23874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Table I). Sequence alignment and hydrophobicity analysis of the family of bacterial SecY proteins predicts the mutations in TMS7 of SecY to be located near the cytosolic membrane interface (Fig. 1). To investigate possible contacts between TMS3 of SecE and TMS7 of SecY, a new set of five unique cysteine mutations was made in TMS3 of SecE, covering positions Leu-95 to Ala-99 (Table I). These are predicted to be at the same membrane depth as the mutants in TMS7 of SecY (Fig. 1). The five cysteine mutations, together with mutation G110C in SecE, located close to the periplasmic membrane interface, were also used to further explore the contact interface with a neighboring TMS3 of SecE. The single-cysteine SecE mutants were placed into a cysteine-less SecYEG expression vector (19Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and overproduced in E. colistrain SF100. IMVs derived from these cells were analyzed for the SecY and SecE expression levels, SecA translocation ATPase activity, and proOmpA translocation. The expression levels of the various mutants as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining were found to be identical to that of the overexpressed cysteine-less and wild-type SecYEG complex (data not shown). The proOmpA-stimulated SecA ATPase activity and the translocation of 125I-labeled proOmpA of the mutants were indistinguishable from that of the cysteine-less and wild-type SecYEG complex (data not shown). None of the mutants was capable of translocating the proOmpA variant Δ8-proOmpA (data not shown), which carriers a defective signal sequence due to the deletion of Ile-8 (29Tanji Y. Gennity J. Pollitt S. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This substrate is effectively translocated by PrlA4 IMVs (30van der Wolk J.P. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data demonstrate that the introduction of the cysteines in respective positions of TMS3 of SecE does not alter the activity or specificity of the SecYEG complex. To investigate the contact interface between two TMS3 of SecE, IMVs containing overexpressed SecYEG complex harboring unique cysteine mutations in TMS3 of SecE (L95C, I96C, V97C, A98C, A99C, and G110C) were oxidized with Cu2+(phenantroline)3and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunodetection using an antibody against SecE (Fig. 2A). Oxidation of the SecYE(A99C)G and SecYE(G110C)G complexes gave rise to a pronounced 28-kDa cross-linking product that is identical to the previously identified SecE-SecE cross-link found for the SecYE(L106C)G complex (19Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The other single-cysteine SecE mutants did not yield a SecE-SecE cross-link. Modeling of the TMS3 of SecE as an α-helix structure shows that Ala-99, Leu-106, and Gly-110 are confined to the same face of the putative α-helix (Fig. 7). This result confirms the predicted α-helix structure of TMS3 of SecE and demonstrates that the interaction between neighboring SecE molecules is confined to a specific side of the α-helix.Figure 7Schematic representation showing the identified sites of interaction between TMS2 and TMS7 of SecY and TMS3 of SecE, and the identified sites of interaction between TMS3 of neighboring SecE molecules.

A low level of SecYE(L106C)G production was achieved by growing cells harboring plasmid pET627 in the presence of 0.5% glucose and omitting IPTG to prevent induction of the trc promotor activity. Western blotting of dilution series showed no more than a 2–3-fold increase in the amount of SecE (see also Fig. 2 B) and SecY (data not shown) as compared with the endogenous level. Overexpression upon induction by IPTG resulted in at least 250-fold increase in the SecYEG level (data not shown, and see Fig.2 B). Samples of IMVs derived from cells harboring pET324 (empty control vector) and pET627 (SecYE(L106)G) with or without induction of overexpression by IPTG were analyzed after oxidation by SDS-PAGE and immunodetection using an antibody against His-tagged SecE (Fig. 2 B). Oxidation of IMVs harboring low amounts of SecYE(L106C)G resulted in the efficient cross-linking of the SecE dimer (Fig. 2 B). This demonstrates that the formation of this complex also occurs at levels of SecYEG that are comparable to those found in wild-type membranes. To identify further contacts between SecE and SecY, the single-cysteine mutations in SecE TMS3 (L95C, I96C, V97C, A98C, A99C) and SecY TMS7 (V274C, I275C, P276C, A277C, I278C, F279C, A280C, and S281C) were co-expressed yielding 40 pairs of cysteine mutants. The activity of the SecY TMS7 mutants have been analyzed previously, and all mutants behave normally except for SecY(I278C)EG that exhibits a prlA phenotype (25Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23868-23874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All pairs of cysteine mutants showed normal levels of overexpression (Fig.3A; data not shown). IMVs were oxidized with Cu2+(phenantroline)3 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig.3 A) or immunoblotting using antibodies against SecY and SecE (Fig. 3 B; data not shown). For two double-cysteine combinations, a higher molecular mass band was observed upon oxidation at the position of an expected SecY-SecE cross-link. The formation of the cross-link product of SecY(P276C) and SecE(V97C) was very efficient, resulting in a nearly complete disappearance of monomeric SecY and SecE. This result implies a stoichiometric interaction between SecE and SecY that was previously assumed but not demonstrated experimentally. Cross-linking between SecY(P276C) and E(L95C) was less efficient. Modeling shows that both contacts cannot be confined to the same α-helical face between the corresponding transmembrane segments (Fig. 7 A). To further investigate the structure of the interface between SecY TMS7 and SecE TMS3, additional double-cysteine combinations were constructed of residues that are located deeper in the membrane. Four SecY TMS7 cysteine mutations (F279C, A280C, S281C, and S282C) were combined with two additional SecE TMS3 cysteine mutations (V100C and T101C). The respective SecYEG complexes again exhibit normal overexpression levels and translocation activities (data not shown). Upon the oxidation of the pairs of cysteine mutants, two additional SecY-SecE cross-links could be identified after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against SecY and SecE (Fig. 3 B). These cross-links occurred between SecY(A280C) and SecE(V100C) or SecE(T101C), but the efficiency was less as compared with the SecY(P276C)-SecE(V97C) combination. Modeling of TMS7 of SecY and TMS3 of SecE as α-helical segments shows that these newly identified contacts are confined to the same helical interface as the SecY(P276C)-SecE(V97C) cross-link (Fig.7). Because the cross-link between SecY(P276C) and SecE(L95C) cannot be modeled into this α-helical interface, we assume that SecE Leu-95 is located outside the membranous environment in a non-α-helical structure (Fig. 7 B). Because the SecY(P276C)-SecE(V97C) and intermolecular SecE(L106C) cross-links are very strong, a triple-cysteine mutant of the SecYEG complex was constructed to determine whether such contacts occur within an oligomeric SecYEG complex. IMVs prepared from cells expressing the SecY(P276C)E(V97C/L106C)G showed normal levels of overproduction (data not shown) and activity (Fig. 5). Immunodetection of oxidized samples showed the presence of strong SecY-(SecE)2 and weaker (SecY)2-(SecE)2 cross-link products (Fig.4). Similar but less efficient cross-link products could be demonstrated for a SecY(P276C)E(V97C/A99C)G mutant (data not shown). These data therefore suggest that the identified SecE-SecE cross-links are at a contact interface between two separate SecYEG complexes. In all samples, a band was observed that stains with the antibody against SecE at the position of SecY-(SecE)2(Fig. 4). However, this band is unrelated to these proteins, as it was also present in the reduced samples and it did not stain with the antibody against SecY. Furthermore, in all samples, a diffuse protein band was detected that stains with the SecY antibody and that migrates with a molecular mass that is between that of the SecY-(SecE)2 and (SecY)2-(SecE)2cross-linking products (Fig. 4). Because this band was observed also with the cysteine-less SecYEG complex, albeit weaker, we assume that it represents an aggregated SecY dimer, the formation of which is stimulated by the oxidation.Figure 4Disulfide cross-linking of a SecYE dimer. IMVs containing the cysteine-less SecYEG, SecYE(L106C)G, SecY(P276C)E(V97C)G, and SecY(P276C)E(V97C/L106C)G were reduced with 5 mm DTT (–) or oxidized with 1 mmCu2+(phenantroline)3(Cu 2+ (phe) 3) (+). Samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunostaining using antibodies against His-tagged SecY and SecE. The SecE-SecE (E-E), SecY-SecE (Y-E), SecY-(SecE)2(Y-E 2), and (SecY)2-(SecE)2(Y 2 -E 2) cross-links are indicated with arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) IMVs harboring overexpressed cysteine-less SecYEG, SecYE(L106C)G, SecY(P276C)E(V97C)G, and SecY(P276C)E(V97C/L106C)G were assayed for the effect of cross-linking on the translocation activity. IMVs were either reduced in the presence of DTT or oxidized with Cu2+(phenantroline)3. Oxidized samples were re-reduced by the incubation in DTT, and the activity was assayed by the translocation of 125I-proOmpA (Fig.5). The activity of the cysteine-less SecYEG was not affected by the oxidation-reduction conditions. Under oxidizing conditions, however, translocation of proOmpA proceeded only to the I29 intermediate due to the presence of a disulfide bond in the C-terminal end of proOmpA (19Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All three cysteine mutant SecYEG complexes displayed normal activity under reduced condition but were nearly completely inactive under oxidizing conditions. With all mutants, substantial activity could be recovered after re-reduction of the samples. Using the thiol-mediated contact between neighboring SecE molecules as a molecular ruler, we have shown previously that during the initiation of preprotein translocation, the intermolecular SecE contact is enhanced (19Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To investigate the dynamics of the SecY-SecE contact, the same technique was employed using the SecY(P276C)E(V97C)G complex. IMVs were preincubated in DTT, incubated under various translocation conditions, and subsequently oxidized with Cu2+(phenantroline)3 to probe for the efficiency of SecY-SecE cross-linking. Because formation of the SecY-SecE contact is already very efficient under nontranslocating conditions, a less-than-op"

The interaction between the IGF-1 receptor and IIP-1 as well as a splice variant IIP-1/p26 was demonstrated in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using co-precipitation experiments, we confirmed the interaction in transfected cells as well as in vitro. Analysis of deletion mutants indicates that the PDZ domain of IIP-1 mediates interaction with the C-terminal tail of the IGF-1 receptor (serine-threonine-cysteine). This finding demonstrates that the C terminus of the IGF-1 receptor acts as novel PDZ domain binding site. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed an overlapping localization of IIP-1 and the IGF-1 receptor in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. A functional connection between IIP-1 and the IGF-1 receptor is further supported by the finding that the level of expression of IIP-1 and the IGF-1 receptor strongly correlates in different normal and cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of IIP-1 resulted in an attenuation of migration of MCF-7 cells, which is one of the biological activities mediated by the IGF-1 signaling system.

Furthermore, overexpression of IIP-1 resulted in an attenuation of migration of MCF-7 cells, which is one of the biological activities mediated by the IGF-1 signaling system. insulin-like growth factor-1 IGF-1 receptor insulin receptor IGF-1 receptor interacting protein-1 postsynaptic density protein-95, disc large, zonula occludens-1 GAIP interacting protein, C-terminus Gα interacting protein SemF cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1, TIP-2, Tax interacting protein-2, HTLV-1, human T-cell leukemia virus-1, PI3K IRS-1, -2, insulin-receptor substrates 1 and 2 src homology-2 amino acid(s) polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription nucleotide(s) expressed sequence tag Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline glutathione S-transferase cytomegalovirus fetal calf serum 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide mitogen-activated protein base pair(s) Signaling by the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)1 receptor plays a crucial role in cellular growth, migration, and survival (1Butler A.A.

The IGF-1 receptor belongs to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases and shares a high degree of homology with the insulin receptor (2Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Francke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). Several signaling proteins are known to interact with the cytoplasmic part of the IGF-1 receptor, the insulin receptor and several other receptor tyrosine kinases. For example, it was shown that p85, the regulatory domain of the PI3K, interacts with the IGF-1 receptor (3Lamothe B. Bucchini D. Jami J. Joshi R.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J. Sawka-Verhelle D. Holt K.H. Pessin J.E. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). However, p85 also binds to many other receptor tyrosine kinases of virtually all sub-families. Another binding partner of the IGF-1 receptor defined by two-hybrid screening is Grb 10, which binds also to other receptor tyrosine kinases like the insulin receptor and c-Ret (5Dey B.R. Frick K.

IRS-1, IRS-2, and SHC were also found to interact both with the IGF-1 receptor and the insulin receptor (5Dey B.R. Frick K. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Furlanetto R.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

More recently, mSH2B was described as IGF-1 receptor binding protein, which also interacts with the insulin receptor (10Wang J. Riedel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3136-3139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins were shown to interact with the IGF-1 receptor but not the insulin receptor (11Furlanetto R.W. Dey B.R. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, 14-3-3 proteins also influence insulin signaling via binding to IRS-1 (12Ogihara T. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Taoka M. Funaki M. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Inukai K. Anai M. Fukushima Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25267-25274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Taken together, relatively little is known about specific signal transducers of the IGF-1 receptor. The primary physiological role of the insulin receptor is to regulate metabolic events, whereas the IGF-1 receptor activated by its ligands has a major impact on mitogenicity, transformation, and survival (13Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F105-F126Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In addition, signaling by the IGF-1 receptor is implicated in the chemotactic activity of tumor cells (14Brodt P. Samani A. Navab R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the similarity of the amino acid sequence and many shared signaling proteins, unique biological effector molecules for the IGF-1 receptor and the insulin receptor are likely to participate in transducing the specific responses of these receptors. The finding that signaling of receptor chimera, in which the cytoplasmic domain of the IGF-1 receptor was fused to the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor, caused an increased mitogenic response compared with the wild type insulin receptor, supports the hypothesis of such divergent pathways (15Lammers R. Gray A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region represents the most disparate domain between the IGF-1 receptor and the insulin receptor and is particularly important for the differences in signaling events (16Miura M. Surmacz E. Burgaud J.L. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22639-22644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Miura M. Morrione A. Baserga R.

Stannard B. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13922-13928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this region might act as a prime candidate binding site for specific signaling proteins. The knowledge of such specific protein interactions discriminating the IGF-1 receptor from the insulin receptor might open novel ways for targeted therapeutic interventions. To elucidate the differences in the signal transduction pathways of the IGF-1 receptor and the insulin receptor, it requires the isolation of proteins binding selectively to one of these receptors. In this study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the cytoplasmic domain of the IGF-1 receptor as bait to identify such proteins. Among several proteins we identified IIP-1, a PDZ domain protein, as a specific binding partner for the IGF-1 receptor, which does not bind to the insulin receptor or a number of other receptor tyrosine kinases tested. PDZ proteins are known to integrate several different signaling proteins in one complex at the plasma membrane (21Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Therefore, IIP-1 might cluster the IGF-1 receptor in a signaling complex, resulting in the induction of the specific cellular effects of this receptor. The cDNA coding for the cytoplasmic domain of the human IGF-1 receptor (wtIGF-1R: aa 960–1367) or a kinase-inactive mutant (muIGF-1R: K1033A) was fused to the LexA sequence in the yeast expression vector BTM116 (22Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). wtIGF-1R-LexA bait constructs, which code for different amino acid sequences in the linker region between the IGF-1R domain and the LexA domain, were transfected in the yeast strain L40 and assayed for phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and for interaction with the p85α-subunit of the PI3K expressed as VP16 activation domain fusion protein. Expression of the IGF-1R-LexA construct with a proline-glycine spacer resulted in the highest autokinase activity and the strongest interaction with p85α (PCR was performed with the following oligonucleotides: sense primer with an EcoRI/SmaI adaptor: 5′-TCCGGAATTCCCGGGGAGAAAGAGAAATAACAGCAGGCTGG3-′, reverse primer with an SalI/BamHI adaptor: 5′-TCCGGTCGACGGATCCAAGGATCAGCAGGTCGAA-3′). This bait construct was chosen for screening a VP16-activation-domain cDNA library from E10.5 mouse embryos (22Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and a Gal4-activation-domain cDNA library from Jurkat cells (23Germani A. Romero F. Houlard M. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Varin-Blank N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3798-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). VP16 plasmids and Gal4 plasmids from yeast colonies, which grew under triple selection (-Trp,-Leu,-His), were recovered and sequenced. Sequence analyses were performed by online BLAST searches. For protein-protein interaction assays, BTM116 bait constructs and VP16 prey constructs were co-transfected in L40 yeast cells. The transfectants were analyzed for growth on selective medium (-Trp,-Leu,-His) or β-galactosidase activity performing liquid culture assays (24Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of IIP-1 (PDZ: aa 118–229; PDZΔN: aa 150–214; PDZΔC: aa 129–188) were produced by PCR using the cDNA of IIP-1a (aa 116–323) as template. PCR products were cloned into the NotI site of the VP16 prey vector. The C-terminal peptides of the IGF-1R (aa 1357–1367), the insulin receptor (aa 1418–1428), and the mutant peptides were produced via cloning of the respective oligonucleotides into BTM116. Correct sequence of all constructs was verified by automated DNA sequencing. Further bait and prey plasmids have been described previously (22Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 25Vayssiere B. Zalcman G. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Ligensa T. Weidner K.M. Chardin P. Camonis J.

To obtain the full-length cDNA of IIP-1, we performed a RT-PCR reaction with poly(A) RNA from MCF-7 cells. Oligonucleotides hybridizing 5′ and 3′ of the open reading frame of IIP-1 were designed from the IIP-1 cDNA (1819 nt), which was assembled using expressed sequence tags from the GenBank™ EMBL data base (BE019401 nt 85–383, BE729338 nt 204–308) and the partial cDNA of TIP-2 (GenBank™ EMBL data base: AF028824, nt 1–1416) (sense primer: 5′-GAAACCCACAGGAGGCAA-3′, reverse primer: 5′-GGTCATCATCGCAGGGTC-3′). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands of the expected length were isolated, sequenced, and cloned into different expression vectors. Cell lines I24 (NIH3T3 cells expressing recombinant human IGF-1 receptor), HEK 293, MCF-7, G361, SW480, and human fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Roche Biochemicals) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 10 mml-glutamine. I24 cells were maintained in DMEM medium containing additionally 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Roche Biochemicals). Suspension cell lines MOLT-3, Daudi, HL-60, and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 10 mml-glutamine. Human mammary epithelial cells were cultured in mammary epithelial cell growth medium (Biowhittaker), small airway epithelial cells in small airway epithelial cell growth medium and human keratinocytes in defined keratinocyte serum free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Peripheral blood lymphocytes were prepared from human blood by Ficoll gradient separation. Total protein from cells was extracted in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5/150 mm NaCl/1.5 mmMgCl2/1 mm EDTA/10% glycerol (v/v)/1% Triton X-100 (v/v)/1 mm Na3VO4/Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Biochemicals). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Full-length IIP-1 was cloned in-frame into pGEX5 × 1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant GST-IIP-1 was adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the purified protein was used for immunization of rabbits. Immunoglobulins of the IIP-1 antiserum were precipitated with ammonium sulfate. IgGs were purified on a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Specificity of the anti-IIP-1 antiserum was analyzed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and Western blots. Protein lysates or precipitates from immunoprecipitation experiments were boiled for 5 min in SDS loading buffer (5×: 50% glycerol (v/v)/250 mm Tris, pH 6.8/10% SDS (w/v)/500 mm dithiothreitol/0.5% bromphenol blue), resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) dry milk in PBST (1% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS). Incubation with primary antibodies was performed in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBST. The anti-IGF-1Rβ antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the anti-insulin receptor-β antibody C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were diluted to a concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, and the anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The purified anti-IIP-1 antiserum was used at a 1:100 dilution. After 1-h incubation, the membrane was washed three times with PBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a concentration of 0.4 μg/ml in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBST for 30 min. After three PBST washes, the signal was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Some blots were stripped by incubation for 45 min at 50 °C in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS (w/v), and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then reprobed with other antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Full-length IIP-1 and p85β (GenBank™ accession number Y13569, aa 591–722) were expressed as GST fusion proteins in the Escherichia coli strain BL21. As control, GST alone was expressed in BL21. GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. IGF-1 receptor-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells (I24) were serum-starved for 24 h. 1 × 106 serum-starved cells or cells stimulated with 10−8m IGF-1 (Roche Biochemicals) for 10 min were solubilized in 300 μl of lysis buffer. GST fusion proteins (5 μg) adsorbed to 80 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (50% (w/v) were added to the cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times with 1 ml ice-cold lysis buffer. The bound proteins were solubilized in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. IIP-1 and p85β (GenBank™ accession number Y13569, aa 591–722) were cloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal FLAG-tag (MDYKDDDDKGRPQIL). For immunoprecipitation experiments from mammalian cells, 2.5 × 106 HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1FLAG-IIP-1 or pcDNA3.1FLAG-p85β and 5 μg of a pRK5 expression vector (27Guo C.H. Janovick J.A. Kuphal D. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3031-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) coding for the wt or kinase-inactive mutant (K1033A) of the IGF-1 receptor or 5 μg of a pCMV plasmid (28Kellerer M. Mushack J. Seffer E. Mischak H. Ullrich A. Haring H.U. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) encoding the insulin receptor. For transfection in HEK 293 cells the FuGene transfection reagent was used (Roche Biochemicals). Using anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma, 50% v/v) immunoprecipitation experiments were performed 24 h post-transfection as described previously (15Lammers R. Gray A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting. 5 × 105 MCF-7 cells were seeded on four-well coverslips (Falcon) and transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1FLAG-IIP-1 using the FuGene transfection reagent. 24 h post-transfection cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in 100 mmphosphate buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4/150 mm NaCl) for 25 min. Fixed cells were blocked and permeabilized with blocking solution (16.7% FCS (v/v)/0.3% Triton X-100 (v/v) in 100 mm phosphate buffer) and then incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution (purified anti-IIP-1 antiserum 1:10, monoclonal anti-IGF-1Rα antibody Ab-1, Oncogene, 2 μg/ml) for 2 h, followed by a 90-min incubation with secondary antibodies (Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1.5 μg/ml in blocking solution). After each antibody incubation, coverslips were washed three times in phosphate buffer. Cells were mounted with 70% glycerol in phosphate buffer. Immunofluorescence was captured using a 3-charge-coupled device color video camera (Sony, DXC-950P). FLAG-IIP-1 was cloned in the pTre plasmid (CLONTECH). MCF-7 cells were sequentially transfected with the pTet-on (CLONTECH) and pTreFLAG-IIP-1 plasmids using the FuGene transfection reagent (Roche Biochemicals). pTet-on transfectants were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418; pTet-on and pTreFLAG-IIP-1 double transfectants were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin (Roche Biochemicals). Cell clones were isolated and maintained in DMEM containing the respective selection markers. Expression of FLAG-IIP-1 was induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (CLONTECH). Cell migration experiments were performed with MCF-7 transfectants in Transwell chambers as described previously (29Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Zhao Z.J. Lacalle R.A. Martinez A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Expression of IIP-1 was induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline 24 h before starting the migration assay. Cells were detached with cell dissociation solution (Sigma), resuspended in serum free medium in the presence and absence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline, and seeded in the upper chamber of 12-μm pore Transwells (12/plate) (Costar) at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. The lower chamber was loaded with 20% FCS in DMEM with and without 1 μg/ml doxycycline. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C, 1/10 volume MTT (Sigma; 5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to the upper and lower chamber and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The resulting formazan salt crystals were scraped from the upper part of the membrane, transferred to a reaction tube, and solubilized in 500 μl of solubilization solution (100 ml of isopropanol/80 μl of 37% HCl/10 mg of SDS) overnight at 37 °C. Medium was removed from the lower chamber, and formazan crystals on the lower part of the membrane were solubilized with 500 μl of solubilization solution overnight at 37 °C. The solubilized formazan products of the upper and lower chambers were spectrophotometrically quantified at 550 nm with a reference wavelength of 690 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Cell proliferation experiments were also performed with MCF-7 transfectants. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in 10% FCS (v/v)-DMEM medium with and without 1 μg/ml doxycycline. After 24 h, cells were synchronized in 0.1% dialyzed FCS (v/v)-DMEM medium for 24 h. Cells were then cultured for 48 h in 0.1% dialyzed FCS (v/v)-DMEM medium in the presence and absence of 10−8m IGF-1. Cell proliferation was quantified by WST-1 assay (Roche Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To identify specific IGF-1 receptor-interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the cytoplasmic domain of the IGF-1 receptor as bait. To achieve autophosphorylation of the bait in yeast, the cytoplasmic domain of the IGF-1 receptor was fused to the LexA DNA binding protein. This leads to dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of the fused bait (22Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and allows isolation of proteins, which interact with the activated as well as with the quiescent IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase. Best phosphorylation was obtained with a LexA-IGF-1 receptor fusion protein linked via a proline-glycine spacer (data not shown). Screening of cDNA libraries with the LexA-IGF-1 receptor bait resulted in the identification of several cDNA sequences. Some of these cDNAs code for SH2 domain-containing proteins already known to bind to the IGF-1 receptor like p85PI3K, Grb10, and mSH2B (3Lamothe B. Bucchini D. Jami J. Joshi R.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Morrione A. Valentinis B. Li S. Ooi J.Y. Margolis B. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3165-3167PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wang J. Riedel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3136-3139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We also isolated 14-3-3β as an IGF-1 receptor binding protein. This isoform of the 14-3-3 protein family as well as 14-3-3ζ have already been described to bind specifically to the IGF-1 receptor but not to the insulin receptor (11Furlanetto R.W. Dey B.R. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found SH2 domain proteins, which have not yet been identified as partners of the IGF-1 receptor. For example, APS first identified in a two-hybrid screen with c-Kit as bait (30Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Masuhara M. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the src-like kinase p59fyn (31Cooke M.P. Perlmutter R.M. New Biol. 1989; 1: 66-74PubMed Google Scholar) were both isolated as new cytoplasmic IGF-1 receptor binding proteins (Fig.1 A). Other SH2 domains like Grb2-SH2 did not interact with the IGF-1 receptor but with other receptor tyrosine kinases like c-Met (32Stefan M. Koch A. Mancini A. Mohr A. Weidner K.M. Niemann H. Tamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3017-3023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also isolated cDNA sequences coding for proteins yet unknown as partners for the IGF-1 receptor and without an SH2 or other phosphotyrosine binding domains. Among these, we focused on theIGF-1 receptor interactingprotein-1 (IIP-1), which was identified in our yeast two-hybrid screen as a strong binder of the IGF-1 receptor (Fig.1 A). A BLAST search of nucleic acid data bases revealed that IIP-1 is identical to a partial cDNA clone encoding a PDZ domain protein (TIP-2), which was found to interact with the Tax transactivator protein from HTLV-1 (33Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the course of this study, IIP-1 was independently described as GIPC, a PDZ domain protein isolated as interaction partner of the RGS protein GAIP (34De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The coding region of IIP-1 is identical to GIPC, but the nucleotide sequences of IIP-1 and GIPC differ in the 5′-untranslated region (nt 1–55 of GIPC). IIP-1 was also recently described as SEMCAP-1, which is a SemF binding protein (35Wang L.H. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14137-14146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and as Synectin, a Syndecan-4 interacting protein (36Gao Y. Li M. Chen W. Simons M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To determine whether binding of the new IGF-1 receptor interacting proteins depends upon tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor, a kinase-inactive mutant of the IGF-1 receptor (muIGF-1R) was assessed for interaction with these proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system. IIP-1 interacted with both the quiescent and the activated receptor with similar strength (Fig. 1 A). Apparently, binding of IIP-1 to the IGF-1 receptor does not depend on tyrosyl phosphorylation of the receptor. In contrast, the SH2 domain-containing proteins APS, mSH2B, p59fyn, p85, and Grb10 only bound to the activated IGF-1 receptor, which is in line with the SH2-mediated phosphotyrosine interaction of these proteins. Next, we were interested to determine the binding specificity of these proteins for the IGF-1 receptor with respect to other receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly to the related insulin receptor. Therefore, we analyzed the interaction of these proteins with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. APS, mSH2B, and p59fyn interacted with the insulin receptor with similar strength as with the IGF-1 receptor (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, IIP-1 did not interact with the insulin receptor despite the high homology to the IGF-1 receptor. To further prove the binding specificity of IIP-1 for the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase, we tested various other receptor tyrosine kinases, for example c-Ros, c-Met, c-Ret, c-Kit, and c-Fms, for interaction with IIP-1 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Interestingly, none of these receptor tyrosine kinases showed binding to IIP-1, but all interacted with the p85 β-subunit of the PI3K (Fig. 1 B). These results strongly suggest that IIP-1 is a specific binding protein of the IGF-1 receptor compared with several other receptor tyrosine kinases. Of special interest is the finding that IIP-1 does not interact with the insulin receptor, which is the closest relative of the IGF-1 receptor. Screening of a mouse embryo cDNA library resulted in isolation of two partial cDNA clones of IIP-1. Based on expressed sequence tag sequences, human full-length IIP-1 was assembled and cloned from MCF-7 poly(A) RNA by RT-PCR. We obtained two fragments, a longer one with 1076 nt in length, which corresponds to the cDNA of IIP-1 and a shorter one with 759 nt in length (Fig.2 A). Sequence analysis revealed that nt 145–462 of the full-length cDNA of IIP-1, including the start codon, are absent in the smaller PCR fragment. To elucidate whether the shorter IIP-1 cDNA might be due to alternative splicing, we analyzed the genomic organization of IIP1. The IIP-1 cDNA is encoded by eight exons (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, exon 3 consists exactly of the 317 nt that are absent in the smaller PCR product. This indicates"

Dis. 1974; 130: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). One of these proteins is the alkaline protease aeruginolysin (APR),1 originally characterized by Morihara (5Morihara K. Tsuzuki H.

Hege and U. Baumann, unpublished data. shows that serralysins can be divided into an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal structural domain, each consisting of about 230 to 240 residues. The structural domain consists of the secretion signal located within the last 70 residues and a repetitive glycine-rich nonapeptide (15Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1991; 5: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and appear to be involved also in the secretion process. Like other serralysin secretors, P. aeruginosa can produce a specific protease inhibitory protein of 131 residues, including a signal peptide of 25 residues that is cleaved off during secretion into the periplasm. The inhibitor is entirely located in the periplasm ofP. aeruginosa, where its presumed physiological function is to protect the periplasmic proteins against the secreted protease. Until now, there are seven known members of this inhibitor family with a sequence identity of about 20% and a similarity of about 50% (Refs.17Duong F. Lazdunski A. Cami B. Murgier M.

The structure of the E. chrysanthemiinhibitor has been solved by x-ray crystallography (19Baumann U. Bauer M. Létoffé S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It consists of an eight-stranded β-barrel and an N-terminal segment of ∼10 residues on top of the barrel. This highly conserved segment was shown to be just long enough for Ser-1I to reach the catalytic zinc ion of the protease, with the barrel body preventing further intrusion of the inhibitor into the active-site cleft. N-terminal sequence analysis revealed that Ser-1I is cleaved off to about 50%, making interpretations regarding Ser-1I more difficult. Recent kinetic studies on the alkaline protease inhibitor ofP. aeruginosa (APRin) (20Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) revealed a large difference in the inhibitory activity (KD of 4 pm) compared with the inhibitors of E. chrysanthemi (21Létoffé S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) andS. marcescens (22Bae K.H. Kim I.C. Kim K.S. Shin Y.C. Byun S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which have KD values of 1–10 and 0.7 μm, respectively. Detailed analysis of the kinetic data from APRin with its cognate protease APR revealed the importance of the N-terminal trunk of the inhibitor for high-affinity binding (20Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of metallo-endoproteases in many diseases (e.g. cancer or arthritis) and to get a better understanding of what leads to this difference in inhibitory activity, we determined the crystal structure of the complex between P. aeruginosa alkaline protease and its cognate inhibitor (Protein Data Bank code 1JIW). Wild-type APRin was expressed from the pET22b(+) vector in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified from periplasm obtained by osmotic shock as described by Feltzer et al. (20Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The protein exhibited the expected mass by electrospray mass spectrometry. Crystalline APR was from Nagase Biochemicals, Tokyo, and was purified as described previously (20Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Crystals were obtained by the vapor diffusion method (sitting or hanging drops) using either 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG 4000), 20% isopropanol, and 0.1m citrate (pH 5.6) or 30% PEG 4000, 0.2 mammonium acetate, and 0.1 m citrate (pH 5.6) at 20 °C. Crystals belong to orthorhombic space groups P21212 and P212121, respectively. The asymmetric unit of each crystal form contains one complex with a molecular mass of about 60 kDa. A data set from a crystal grown in the buffer containing isopropanol was collected at the Swiss Norwegian beam line of the European synchrotron radiation facility in Grenoble on a MAR345 image plate at a temperature of 110 K, a distance of 270 mm, and a frame width of 0.5°. An additional data set from a crystal grown under ammonium acetate condition was collected in house on a rotating anode generator (Rigaku) with an R-Axis IV image plate. All data were processed with the HKL suite (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38431) Google Scholar).

Calculations and refinement were done using the programs of CNS, version 1.0 (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13005) Google Scholar). The rotation function calculated in the resolution range from 15 to 4 Å yielded one solution with a height of 4.87 ς above the mean; the next highest peak scored 1.60 ς. The translation function gave a unique solution with a correlation coefficient of 0.68 (second highest solution, 0.11). The following rigid body refinement led to a decrease of the R-factor from 0.47 to 0.38 in the resolution range from 15 to 3.5 Å. A SIGMAA-weighted 2Fo − Fcelectron density map revealed well defined additional electron density near the active-site cleft, which was readily interpreted even without using the known E. chrysanthemi inhibitor structure (19Baumann U. Bauer M. Létoffé S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Only a few regions showed no interpretable density (loops between s1 and s2, s6 and s7), and it took several rounds of rebuilding and refinement until these parts of the structure could be fitted reliably in the electron density. The model was subjected to further refinement and was completed in the usual stepwise manner. In later stages, water molecules were inserted at stereochemically reasonable positions where the difference density had values of three ς above the mean and the 2Fo − Fcmap showed density at the one ς level. Refinement statistics are shown in Table II. The inhibitor of P. aeruginosa folds into an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel with the approximate dimensions 33 × 33 × 26 Å and a simple up-down topology (Fig. 1). Although the sequence similarity between the inhibitors of P. aeruginosa and E. chrysanthemi is around 50%, the x-ray structures are almost identical, including the N-terminal segment, the disulfide bridge (Cys-26I and Cys-49I), the helices hA and hB, and the hydrophobic core. The r.m.s. deviation of 97 equivalent Cα atoms (out of 100 and 105, respectively) is about 1.4 Å. Differences occur in the loops between the β-strands and usually derive from additional amino acids in the P. aeruginosainhibitor; the loop connecting β-strands s1 and s2 is enlarged by two residues, the loops between s2 and s3 and between s6 and s7 are enlarged by one residue each, and there is one additional residue at the C terminus. A comparison between the structures of the two crystal forms shows no major differences despite very different packing; the r.m.s. deviation of all Cα atoms is 0.45 Å, which is approximately within the error limits. Especially notable is that all segments of APRin interacting with the protease, including the N-terminal trunk, exhibit identical conformations. A total of 118 contacts within 3.8 Å between APR and APRin are found in this complex. APRin contacts the protease mainly via its N-terminal trunk (residues 1I–5I), the type IV β-turn connecting β-strands s4 and s5 (comprising residues 62I–66I) and the loop 81I–85I. Further interaction sites are residues 71I, 74I, and 36I, which are located in loops on the barrel bottom according to the orientation shown in Fig.1. On the side of the protease residues from the edge strand (134P–136P), the active-site tyrosine 218P and the flexible loop closing the active-site cleft (residues 188P–192P) are in close contact with the inhibitor. Further interactions involve Tyr-169P and the segment 225P–227P. Table III shows an interaction matrix between protease and inhibitor.Table IIIContact matrixInhibitor residues are in rows, protease residues in columns. Hydrogen bonds are denoted in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Inhibitor residues are in rows, protease residues in columns. Hydrogen bonds are denoted in parentheses. The five N-terminal residues of APRin bind in an extended conformation along the active-site cleft (Fig. 2,A and B). The twist of the N-terminal segment that was observed in the E. chrysanthemi inhibitor occurs in APRin as well. The twist is probably not a feature of the free inhibitor, where the N-terminal segment is flexible, 4C. Siebold and U. Baumann, unpublished results. but rather is imposed by the binding to the protease. This strong twist of the N-terminal segment leads to a binding mode presumably slightly different from substrates, which most likely bind as antiparallel β-strands to the edge strand of the protease, employing full hydrogen bonding of the backbone. One of the most conspicuous features is the close contact of the N-terminal amino group of Ser-1I of the inhibitor and the catalytic zinc ion. Ser-1I occupies a position roughly between the P1 and P1′ residues of a true substrate. In the case of the E. chrysanthemi inhibitor-S. marcescens protease complex, this residue was partially cleaved off leading to some difficulties in the interpretation regarding its interactions with the zinc ion. In the structure reported here, no proteolytic cleavage has taken place and the electron density map is unambiguous (Fig. 2 A). The distances between the carbonyl oxygen and the N-terminal amino group of Ser-1I and the zinc ion are only 2.22 and 2.19 Å, respectively, and hence are in the range of a coordinative bond. For comparison, the distances between Nε2 of the histidine ligands and the Zn2+ are 2.09, 2.16, and 2.03 Å. The N terminus replaces the catalytically active water molecule that is normally bound to the zinc ion. This structural feature might not only provoke the twist at the N-terminal trunk but might also be responsible for the observed decrease of KD to about 4 pmcompared with the E. chrysanthemi and S. marcescens complexes for which dissociation constants in the 0.1 to 1 micromolar range have been reported (21Létoffé S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Bae K.H. Kim I.C. Kim K.S. Shin Y.C. Byun S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The conserved Ser-2I donates a hydrogen bond to Glu-177P, the catalytic base of the HEXXH motif, similar to the one observed in theE. chrysanthemi inhibitor complex. Also, the main-chain hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-2I and the backbone amide nitrogen of residue Ala-134P is present in this complex. Further interactions occur between the barrel body of the inhibitor (s5, s6, and s7) and the irregular loop 218P–229P of the protease. Analysis of the interface shows that 1990 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface become buried upon complex formation, a result very comparable with the one obtained in the case of the Inh·SMP complex. To evaluate further the differences in binding of APRin to APR compared with Inh·SMP, a geometrical shape complementarity analysis was carried out using the program SC (26Lawrence C.M. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) as implemented in the CCP4 package (27Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19727) Google Scholar). The correlation coefficient in the Inh·SMP complex was calculated to be 0.67 compared with 0.73 in the case of APRin·APR, a small but significant increase. This analysis also shows that the water-filled cavity reported to exist between inhibitor barrel and protease in the Inh·SMP complex is also present in the APRin·APR structure, although considerably reduced in size from 185 to 65 Å3. This high-resolution structure of the APR·APRin complex reveals clearly the presence of a coordinative interaction between the N terminus of the inhibitor and the catalytic zinc ion. For this, the N-terminal amino group, which has a pKa ∼ 8, has to be deprotonated first. This proton could be transferred to a water molecule or to Glu-177P. It is reasonable to assume that the pKa of the amino terminus becomes significantly lower upon interaction with the zinc ion. Interestingly, similar interactions have been observed between matrix metalloproteases and their cognate inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 (28Gomis-Rüth F.X.

Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) Fig. 3 shows the structure of the complex between TIMP-2 and MT-1 (29Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1BUV). The binding mode, including the N-terminal coordination of the zinc and the hydrogen bonds between Ser-2I and the protease, is absolutely conserved despite the lack of any homology between the two inhibitors. This confirms an earlier hypothesis that proteinaceous metzincin inhibitors show similar inhibition modes. The small serralysin inhibitors, however, lack the interactions present in the TIMP complexes with the S-sites of the protease (28Gomis-Rüth F.X. Maskos K Betz M Bergner A Huber R Suzuki K Yoshida N Nagase H Brew K Bourenkov GP Bartunik H Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). However, although the binding of the inhibitors is similar, specificity between TIMP and serralysin inhibitors is different. For example, APRin neither inhibits collagenase, gelatinase A, or gelatinase B (20Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) nor has it been reported that TIMPs inhibit serralysins. The lack of inhibition arises from the different surfaces on the inhibitor body and the proteases. The length of the N-terminal trunk is precisely such that the amino group reaches the zinc ion and the N-terminal residue chelates the zinc via the NH2 group and the carbonyl oxygen. The β-barrel body of the inhibitor prevents the N-terminal trunk from being drawn further into the active-site cleft and subsequent proteolysis. On the other hand, the serralysin inhibitors cross-react at least to some extent with the various serralysins. This can be explained by the fact that most interactions occur within the rather conserved N-terminal trunk of the inhibitor and the S′-sites of the protease whereby there is a lack of side chain–side chain interaction and hence of sequence specificity. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments (20Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce W.M. J. Biol.

The interaction between Tyr-216P, the putative electrophile stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate in catalysis, and Ser-1I seems to be of minor importance because mutation of Ser-1I to Gly gives an even somewhat lower dissociation constant. Overlay of the APR·APRin structure on the Inh·SMP complex shows some clashes occurring between the barrel body of the inhibitor and the non-cognate protease SMP, which would probably lead to a higher dissociation constant; however, the N-terminal trunks overlay very well. An unsolved problem is the explanation of the vastly differing inhibition constants reported for various serralysin inhibitors. One reason could be that some studies have paid only slight attention to the presence of an intact mature N terminus. In the case of theSerratia inhibitor, original expression studies in S. marcescens led to a product in which the N terminus was shortened by three amino acids (22Bae K.H. Kim I.C. Kim K.S. Shin Y.C. Byun S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the high conservation of the N-terminal region, studies on the S. marcescens inhibitor SmaPI found virtually no influence from the first two amino acids, or even from the addition of an extra amino acid to the N-terminus, but a very strong contribution from Leu-3I (∼0.7 kcal/mol) (30Kim K.S. Kim T.U Kim I.J Byun S.M. Shin Y.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3035-3041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a residue conserved in all serralysin inhibitors (Table I). Contrary to this finding, Feltzeret al. (20Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) found that Leu-3I contributes only approximately as much as Ser-2I and Ser-1I together. Leu-3I fits nicely into a pocket formed by residues Tyr-216P, Trp-217P, Tyr-169P, and Ala-192P of the protease and the turn 64I–67I of the inhibitor. We cannot explain the differences found in that study using our model, but those authors used a para-nitroanilide substrate, which does not occupy significantly the S′-sites of the protease but rather the S-sites, whereas the APRin binds to the S′sites exclusively. We also cannot exclude the possibility that some “fraying” of the N terminus occurred because of proteolytic cleavage in that study. Such proteolytic processing has been described for SmpI (22Bae K.H. Kim I.C. Kim K.S. Shin Y.C. Byun S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and also in the Inh·SMP structure (19Baumann U. Bauer M. Létoffé S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The same study (30Kim K.S. Kim T.U Kim I.J Byun S.M. Shin Y.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3035-3041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also concluded that there is a significant conformational rearrangement of the protease and/or inhibitor upon complex formation. However, with the exception of two segments, there are no significant differences observable comparing the crystal structures of the alkaline protease in complex with a peptide that occupies the S-sites (13Baumann U. Wu S. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and in the complex with the inhibitor, the latter one occupying the S′-sites of the protease. In accordance with this finding, no significant differences were detected between the fluorescence spectra of the APRin·APR complex and the individual components (20Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The r.m.s. deviations for all Cα atoms of the protease is about 0.58 Å (Fig. 4). The exceptions are the flexible loops 48P–52P and 188P–192P of the protease. The latter is the active-site loop and, interestingly, adopts a slightly different conformation, which may originate from the contacts between segment 83I–88I of the inhibitor. Taking the results of this study and of the Inh·SMP structure, it seems rather unlikely that major conformational rearrangements, either on the inhibitor or the protease side, will take place upon complex formation. A preliminary modeling of APRin complexes with other serralysins,e.g. S. marcescens protease or protease C fromE. chrysanthemi, shows a satisfactory fit with a few clashes between the barrel bodies of the inhibitor and the protease. The main interactions between the N-terminal trunk and protease seem to be conserved, which explains the cross-reactivity.

https://openalex.org/W1968492469,"Processivity, also known as multiple attack on a single chain, is a feature commonly encountered only in enzymes in which the substrate binds in a tunnel. However, of the sevenAspergillus niger endopolygalacturonases, which have an open substrate binding cleft, four enzymes show processive behavior, whereas the other endopolygalacturonases are randomly acting enzymes. In a previous study (Benen, J.A.E., Kester, H.C.M., and Visser, J. (1999) Eur. J. Biochem. 259, 577–585) we proposed that the high affinity for the substrate of subsite −5 of processive endopolygalacturonase I constitutes the origin of the multiple attack behavior. Based on primary sequence alignments of A. nigerendopolygalacturonases and three-dimensional structure analysis of endopolygalacturonase II, an arginine residue was identified in the processive enzymes at a position commensurate with subsite −5, whereas a serine residue was present at this position in the non-processive enzymes. In endopolygalacturonase I mutation R95S was introduced, and in endopolygalacturonase II mutation S91R was introduced. Product progression analysis on polymer substrate and bond cleavage frequency studies using oligogalacturonides of defined chain length for the mutant enzymes revealed that processive/non-processive behavior is indeed interchangeable by one single amino acid substitution at subsite −5, Arg→Ser or Ser→Arg.

The PGs that hydrolyze the homogalacturonan are either endo-acting enzymes (EC 3.2.1.15) or exo-acting enzymes (EC 3.2.1.67). Endo-enzymes attack randomly along the chains of the polymeric substrate in contrast to exo-enzymes that attack the chains from the extremities. In Aspergillus niger, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Botrytis cinerea families of genes encoding endoPGs were discovered (3Bussink H.J.D. Kester H.C.M. Visser J.

Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1596-1602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); but actually little is known about the precise role of the different endoPGs in these organisms. However, the characterization of the seven highly homologous endoPGs secreted by A. niger (PGI, PGII, PGA-E) suggested that individual enzymes harbor specific enzymic and physiological functions. One of the enzymic characteristics is the processive behavior observed for endoPGI, A, C, and D (9Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C. M Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Parenicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Biochem. J. 1999; 345: 637-644Crossref Google Scholar, 11Parenicová L.

French D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 122: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 13Robyt J.F. French D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 138: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) is characterized by multiple attack on a single substrate chain. The initial cleavage is followed by the release of only one part of the substrate, and the retained polymer fragment can be reattacked one or more times. A number of processes were proposed to explain the mechanism of multiple attack (12Robyt J.F. French D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 122: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 13Robyt J.F. French D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 138: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Allen J.D. Thoma J.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 61: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All tend to merge into a common mechanism permitting the sliding of the substrate fragment retained at the enzyme after the initial cleavage. In a previous study comparing endoPGI, II, and C we proposed that the origin of the processive behavior of endoPGI resides in the relatively high affinity at subsite −5 that is responsible for retaining the product at the enzyme after cleavage of the substrate (9Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C. M Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although no subsite affinities were calculated for the processive endoPGA and C, the striking similarity in bond cleavage frequencies and relative rates of cleavage of oligogalacturonides of defined length (9Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C. M Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Parenicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Biochem. J. 1999; 345: 637-644Crossref Google Scholar) also indicated a high affinity for the substrate at subsite −5 for these enzymes. For the processive endoPGD the estimated number of subsites is much smaller and does not extend to subsite −5. In fact, it was proposed that this enzyme is an oligogalacturonide hydrolase (11Parenicová L. Kester H.C.M. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 464: 333-336Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and it was therefore not included in further analyses. Recently, the three-dimensional structure for non-processive endoPGII has become available (15van Santen Y. Benen J.A.E. Schröter K.H. Kalk K.H. Armand S. Visser J. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30474-30480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which, in combination with site-directed mutagenesis studies, allowed us to establish the orientation of binding of the substrate and location of several subsites (16Pagès S.

Based on this knowledge and the biochemical properties of the A. niger endoPGs we analyzed the primary sequences and the endoPGII three-dimensional structure for an amino acid(s) responsible for the difference in processive behavior. Mutant enzymes were prepared and characterized with respect to product progression and mode of action to verify the role of the amino acid identified. Escherichia coli DH5α F′ (F′/endA1, hsdR17, (rK−, mK+), supE44, thi-1,recA1, gyrA (NaIr), relA1, Δ(lacIZYA-argF)U169, deoR, Φ80dlacΔ(lacZ)M15) was used for cloning experiments. A. niger NW188 (cspA1,pyrA6, leu-13, prtF28,goxC) was used for transformation (17Kusters-van Someren M.A. Harmsen J.A.M. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Plasmids pIM3700 and pIM3710 (9Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C. M Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were used as templates for the introduction of the mutations. Both plasmids contain a promoter-gene fusion of the constitutive pyruvate kinase A promoter (pkiA) (18de Graaff L.H. van den Broeck H.C. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the pgaI gene (pIM3700) or the pgaII gene (pIM3710) encoding PGI or PGII, respectively. Plasmid pGW635 containing the pyrA gene (accession number X96734) was used for co-transformation of A. niger NW188. Appropriate mutations were generated using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). The pki-pgaI and pki-pgaII genes were sequenced entirely to check for the introduction of the desired mutation and for the absence of undesired mutations. A. niger NW188 was co-transformed as described previously (17Kusters-van Someren M.A. Harmsen J.A.M. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), using 1 μg of pGW635 and 20 μg of the plasmid carrying the appropriate mutation. Transformants producing the highest amount of mutated PGI or PGII were selected as described before (6Parenicová, L., Benen, J. E. A., Kester, H. C. M., and Visser, J. (1998) 251, 72–80.Google Scholar). Large scale cultivation and purification of the enzymes was carried out as outlined in (19Armand S. Wagemaker M.J.M. Sanchez-Torres P. Kester H.C.M. van Santen Y. Dijkstra B.W. Visser J. Benen J.A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The specific activity, the kinetic parametersVmax and Km on polygalacturonic acid (USB, Cleveland, OH) and the mode of action of each mutant on oligogalacturonides of defined length (n = 3–7) were determined at the pH optimum as described previously (6Parenicová, L., Benen, J. E. A., Kester, H. C. M., and Visser, J. (1998) 251, 72–80.Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows a part of the three-dimensional structure of endoPGII comprising turns 2–7 of the in total 10 full turns of the β-helical enzyme. Depicted are the Cα-trace and several amino acids that we mutagenized previously and assigned to particular subsites (16Pagès S. Heijne W.H.M. Kester H.C.M. Visser J Benen J.A.E. J. Biol.

The catalytic machinery made up by Asp-180, Asp-201, and Asp-202 is most likely located at subsites −1 (19Armand S. Wagemaker M.J.M. Sanchez-Torres P. Kester H.C.M. van Santen Y. Dijkstra B.W. Visser J. Benen J.A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It was shown that Met-150 and Asp-183 are located at subsite −2 (16Pagès S. Heijne W.H.M. Kester H.C.M. Visser J Benen J.A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29348-29353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For Asn-186 bond cleavage frequency (BCF) analysis indicated a position at subsite −3 or −4. Based on an increased rate of hydrolysis of (GalpA)4, indicating a reduced non-productive complex formation, Asn-186 was assigned to subsite −4 (16Pagès S. Heijne W.H.M. Kester H.C.M. Visser J Benen J.A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29348-29353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme substrate complex for pectate lyase and (GalpA)5 was solved in which four GalpA residues were clearly visible (20Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Jurnak F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The pectate lyases and endoPGs are both β-helical enzymes that have a highly similar topology. In the pectate lyase substrate complex structure the four GalpA residues extend over four turns of the helix (20Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Jurnak F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) indicating that each turn of the helix corresponds to an equivalent of the size of one subsite. Indeed the average distance between neighboring Cα atoms of PB1 (see below) in adjacent turns of the pectate lyase is 4.89 Å, whereas the size of the tetramer substrate is 17.72 Å (4.43 Å/GalpA unit). In endoPGII the average distance between neighboring Cα atoms of PB1 in adjacent turns is 4.73 Å. Assuming that the substrate binds linearly in the substrate binding cleft, our previous assignment of Asn-186 to subsite −4 is not correct. Instead Asn-186 should form part of subsite −3. Amino acid residues that form part of subsite −5 should then be located four to five turns from the catalytic machinery. Toward the N terminus of the enzyme the bottom of the substrate binding cleft is composed of parallel β-sheets known as structural element PB1, whereas the wall is constituted by T3 loops (15van Santen Y. Benen J.A.E. Schröter K.H. Kalk K.H. Armand S. Visser J. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30474-30480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2 a sequence alignment is shown of six A. niger endoPGs. The amino acids in the substrate binding cleft on the fifth turn from the catalytic machinery comprise residues Gly-87-Glu-95, whereas those on the fourth turn comprise Lys-127-Asp-135. To identify residues that can explain the affinity difference at subsite −5, a high affinity in processive enzymes (endoPGI, A, and C) or low affinity in non-processive enzymes (endoPGII, B, and E), several straightforward criteria should be met. Firstly, they should be able to interact with the substrate (face out into the cleft) thus eliminating Ile-90, Met-92, Phe-129, and Ala-131 that are part of PB1. Secondly, they should not be identical in all enzymes or conservatively changed, thus ruling out Gly-87, Pro-88, Leu-89, Ser-93, Gly-94, Lys-127, Phe-128, Tyr-130, His-132, and Leu-134. Thirdly, the biochemical properties of the side chains should be compatible with a low or high affinity depending on the enzyme. Of the remaining amino acid residues, Ser-91, Glu-95, Gly-133, and Asp-135, only Ser-91 meets this criterion as it is present in the three non-processive enzymes, whereas it is replaced by an arginine in the processive enzymes. The presence of the charged arginine to interact with the carboxylate of a substrate residue provides an attractive and simple hypothesis to account for the high affinity at subsite −5. To test this hypothesis mutant enzymes endoPGI-R95S and endoPGII-S91R were prepared and characterized. In view of the strong sequence conservation among the A. niger endoPGs and the fact that Ser-91 is located on PB1 facing into the cleft, minimal if any disturbance of the folding of the mutated enzymes is expected, making the result of the mutations a site-specific effect. Strong indications for the processive behavior of an endoPG can be obtained from product progression analysis during polymer hydrolysis. Fig.3, A and B show the product progression profiles of wild type endoPGI and endoPGII, respectively. EndoPGI shows a rapid accumulation of galacturonic acid (GalpA)1 and small oligogalacturonides from the onset of the reaction without a substantial accumulation of (GalpA)n, n > 5 (9Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C. M Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which is typical for a processive endoPG. EndoPGII product progression (Fig.3 B) is characterized by a transient accumulation of oligogalacturonides with degree of polymerization ≥5 followed by the accumulation of smaller oligogalacturonides and (GalpA)1. This profile is typical for random end cleaving enzymes. Fig. 3, C and D show the product progression profiles of endoPGI-R95S and endoPGII-S91R, respectively. Compared with the wild type enzymes (Fig. 3, Aand B) profound changes have occurred. The profile of endoPGI-R95S is typical for a randomly acting enzyme (Fig.3 C), whereas the profile of endoPGII-S91R (Fig.3 D) resembles the one described for processive endoPGI. Thus, the behavior of the mutated enzymes is opposite to their wild type counterparts. The product progression is a result of the mode of action of the enzyme on the individual oligogalacturonides of different chain length. The mode of action analysis using oligogalacturonides of defined chain length is presented in TableI. The data for the wild type enzymes (9Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C. M Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) are included in this Table. For endoPGI and endoPGI-R95S the BCFs for hydrolysis of (GalpA)3 and (GalpA)4 remained the same, and only a small change in BCFs for (GalpA)5 was observed. For wild type endoPGI BCFs on (GalpA)6 could actually not be determined as a result of processive behavior on this substrate, which resulted in deviation from stoichiometry for product pairs (9Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C. M Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore the BCFs of the wild type enzyme for this substrate were deduced from the data on reduced (GalpA)7. These BCFs revealed a strong preference of (GalpA)6 for binding from subsites −5 to +1, which reflects the high affinity at subsite −5. For the mutant endoPGI-R95S stoichiometric product pairs were observed during (GalpA)6 hydrolysis, and the BCFs reflect a preferred binding from subsites −4 to +2. From this we conclude that Arg-95 is indeed located at subsite −5. A second significant effect of the mutation is a 3-fold higher rate of hydrolysis of (GalpA)5 in the mutant enzyme. As a result of the high affinity at subsite −5 in the wild type enzyme, (GalpA)5 can bind in a non-productive mode from subsites −5 to −1. Because the mutation R95S obviously reduced the affinity at subsite −5, as evidenced by the change in the BCFs, the likeliness to form a non-productive complex has decreased. This is also reflected in the Vmax on the polymer substrate (polygalacturonic acid), which increased from 957 units/mg for the wild type enzyme to 1930 units/mg for the mutant enzyme;Km values are <0.15 mg/ml and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively.Table IBond cleavage frequencies on (GalpA)n (2 < n < 8) for wild type endoPGI and endoPGII and mutated forms of endoPGI-R95S and endoPGII-S91REnzymeOligogalacturonide (GalpA)nRateunit/mgendoPGI— G ↓ G wild type1001.6 R95S1002.3— G ↓ G ↓ G wild type3 97150 R95S3 97114 wild type— G — G ↓ G ↓ G wild type48 5296 R95S57 43315G — G — G ↓ G ↓ G ↓ G wild type3 15 82244 R95S17 60 23179G — G — G — G — G — G — G wild type324 R95S285endoPGII— G ↓ G wild type1000.4 S91R1000.3— G — G ↓ G wild type100155 S91R10063 G — G — G ↓ G ↓ G wild type32 68663 S91R10 9035G — G — G ↓ G ↓ G ↓ G wild type8 57 35552 S91R2 15 83513G — G — G — G — G — G — G wild type1200 S91R5100.5 mm of the oligogalacturonide substrates were incubated in 0.5 ml 50 mm sodium acetate buffer pH 4.2 at 30 °C.

At timed intervals aliquots were withdrawn and mixed with stopmix (2.0 mm Tris, 50 mm NaOH) to raise the pH to 8.3–8.5. Products were analysed and quantified by HPAEC-PAD as previously described (6Parenicová, L., Benen, J. E. A., Kester, H. C. M., and Visser, J. (1998) 251, 72–80.Google Scholar). Bond cleavage frequencies are given in percentages. The bold face typescript signifies the reducing end. For wild type endoPGII and enzyme endoPGII-S91R the following Vmax and Km values were calculated on polygalacturonic acid: 4000 units/mg, <0.15 mg/ml and 1400 units/mg, 1.2 mg/ml, respectively. This effect onVmax in the mutant enzyme is most likely caused by the very strong reduction of (GalpA)5hydrolysis and to a lesser extent of (GalpA)4hydrolysis compared with the wild type enzyme (Table I). Because the mutation involved subsite −5 it has to be concluded that the reduced hydrolysis rates are due to unproductive complex formation as a result of increased affinity at subsite −5 (see below). As for endoPGI-R95S, for endoPGII-S91R the effect of the mutation on the BCFs was most evident for (GalpA)6 with a smaller effect on the BCFs for (GalpA)5. This is again compatible with the location of the mutation at subsite −5 with a small contribution to subsite −4. Unlike wild type endoPGI, for endoPGII-S91R stoichiometric product pairs were observed during (GalpA)6 hydrolysis. This demonstrates that this mutant enzyme is not yet processive on (GalpA)6. The deviation from stoichiometry as a result of processivity for this mutant was evident during (GalpA)7 hydrolysis, which precluded the determination of BCFs. Although the possibility of secondary cleavage of this substrate cannot entirely be excluded, we conclude that mutation S91R rendered the enzyme processive for the following reasons: 1) the observed product progression on polymeric substrate is typical for a processive enzyme, and 2) a strong non-productive complex formation is observed (19-fold decreased hydrolysis rate for (GalpA)5), which is a prerequisite for processive behavior. For endoPGII-S91R processivity became evident using (GalpA)7 as a substrate. For wild type endoPGI processive behavior was already observed on (GalpA)6. This discrepancy can be explained by taking the affinity differences in the total subsite array, including subsites −4 to +1, into account. In endoPGI the affinity distribution of the individual subsites is such that the product retained at subsites −5 to −1 as a result of (GalpA)6 hydrolysis can easily slide to subsites −4 to +1 to become hydrolyzed again as the total affinity of subsites −5 to −1 is lower than the total affinity of subsites −4 to +1 (primarily as a result of high affinity of subsites −3 and +1) (9Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C. M Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The high affinity at subsite −5 as result of the introduction of the arginine in endoPGII-S91R may well result in an affinity higher than subsite +1 and thus disfavor the sliding of the product retained at −5 to −1 to −4 to +1. For (GalpA)n,n > 6, the product retained from −5 to −1 extends beyond subsite −5. Sliding of the product retained will lead to a complete covering of the subsites −5 to +1 resulting in a higher total binding energy and thus permitting the processive behavior when the substrate is longer than (GalpA)6. For endoPGC and endoPGA processivity became evident as well using (GalpA)7 as a substrate (9Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C. M Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Parenicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Biochem. J. 1999; 345: 637-644Crossref Google Scholar) indicating the same underlying principle. From primary sequence alignments, three-dimensional structural information, and kinetic analyses, it was deduced that the presence or absence of an arginine or serine residue at subsite −5 might be the pivotal criterion for processive or non-processive behavior of an A. niger endoPG. The detailed characterization of the two mutated enzymes described illustrates that it is possible to switch a processive endoPG into a non-processive one and vice versa. The data presented form solid evidence for the crucial role of the serine and arginine for processive/non-processive behavior."

The pleckstrin homology domain of GRP1 binds phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate and mediates the translocation of GRP1 to the plasma membrane upon agonist stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity. Using a 32P-labeled GRP1 probe to screen a mouse brain cDNA expression library, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding a GRP1-binding partner (GRSP1) that exists as two different splice variants in brain and lung. The GRSP1 protein contains a FERM protein interaction domain as well as two coiled coil domains and may therefore function as a scaffolding protein. Mapping experiments revealed that the interaction of GRP1 and GRSP1 occurs through the coiled coil domains in the two proteins. Immunodepletion experiments indicate that virtually all of the endogenous GRSP1 protein exists as a complex with GRP1 in lung. When co-expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human insulin receptor, both proteins display a diffuse, cytoplasmic localization. Acute translocation and co-localization of GRSP1 and GRP1 to ruffles in the plasma membrane was evident after insulin stimulation.

The polyphosphoinositides control such diverse phenomena as membrane trafficking, chemotaxis, membrane ruffling, cell adhesion, prevention of apoptosis, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation of cells. To define downstream targets for these messengers, we isolated GRP1 by screening for clones that code for proteins that bind labeled 3′-phosphoinositides with high affinity (7Klarlund J.K.

A likely function of the molecule is to couple the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the cell membrane to activation of the small GTP-binding protein ARF6 (9Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H.

The GRP1 family of proteins is recruited to the plasma membrane in many systems upon agonist stimulation by a mechanism that requires the presence of a functional PH domain and that is sensitive to inhibitors of PI-3 kinase (10Langille S.E. Patki V. Klarlund J.K. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1957-1965PubMed Google Scholar). The initial interpretation was that recruitment occurs by direct binding to acutely generated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. However, the mechanism of recruitment may have an additional component; ARF6 activates PI(4)P-5 kinase, resulting in high local concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is now recognized as a signaling molecule in its own right (2Czech M.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 18Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J.

We have found that the double- or triple-glycine motif in the loop connecting the first and second β strand in the PH domains largely determines the binding specificity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 versus PtdIns(4,5)P2of the GRP1 family of molecules (20Klarlund J.K. Tsiaras W. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32816-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Variants that contain two glycines bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with high affinity but bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 poorly, whereas variants that contain three glycines bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 almost as well as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The triple-glycine variants could therefore act as downstream mediators of both PtdIns(4,5)P2and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, whereas the double-glycine variants would be expected only to convey signals from PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Remarkably, it was reported that GRP1, ARNO, and cytohesin-1 all exist as variants that contain either two or three glycine residues in the same individual (21Ogasawara M. Kim S.-C. Adamik R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3221-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting a diversity of the signaling functions of these molecules. Might the GRP1 family proteins have partner proteins that further modulate their localization and functions? An N-terminal sequence of ∼50 amino acids in the GRP1-like proteins has a high probability of forming coiled coil structures according to the “coils” algorithm (22Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coiled coil domains typically function as sites of protein-protein interactions, leading to the formation of homo- or hetero-oligomers. We report here the identification of a GRP1-binding protein, named GRP1 signalingpartner 1 (GRSP1), that interacts with the coil-coil domain of GRP1. It is associated with endogenous GRP1 in intact cells and translocates with GRP1 to the plasma membrane of cells stimulated with insulin. For analysis of possible GRP1-GRP1 interaction, COS-1 cells were seeded in 6-cm tissue culture dishes and transfected the following day with the indicated amounts of GRP1 constructs containing either an HA or a Myc tag in the PCMV5 vector using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) (10Langille S.E. Patki V. Klarlund J.K. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27099-27104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 48 h later, the cells were scraped in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithioerythritol) and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA reagent (Pierce) and adjusted to 1 mg/ml. 7.5 µl of a polyclonal antibody directed to the HA epitope produced in this laboratory or 100 µl of the tissue culture supernatant of the anti-Myc hybridoma MYC 1–9E10.2 (American Type Culture Collection) was added to 100 µl of extract. After incubation for 4 h or overnight, 25 µl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) or 25 µl of immobilized anti-mouse IgG (Cappel) was added, and the sample was incubated for 2 h on an end-over-end mixer. After three rapid washes with 1 ml of lysis buffer, the protein bound to the beads was analyzed by Western blotting using the same antisera. For analysis of the interaction of GRSP1 and GRP1 in COS-1 cells, 2 µg of a pCMV5 construct coding for the 115-kDa lung form of GRSP1 was transfected with 2 µg of pCMV5 encoding GRP1, and precipitation was performed from extracts containing 0.5 mg of protein with 15 µl of antiserum directed against GRP1 (10Langille S.E.

The sera were blocked by incubation with a mixture of the same fusion proteins. Western blotting was performed using affinity-purified antibodies of the sera (10Langille S.E. Patki V. Klarlund J.K.

To determine the presence of GRSP1 in intact tissues, various organs were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in lysis buffer with 1% SDS substituted for the Nonidet P-40 using a Polytron® homogenizer. To analyze the presence of GRP1·GRSP1 complexes in intact tissues, lungs from BALB/c mice were homogenized in lysis buffer and clarified by centrifugation, and aliquots corresponding to 2 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated as above using 7.5 µg of immunopurified GRP1 or GRSP1 antibody. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-GRP1 was engineered to contain a protein kinase A site by the addition of the coding sequence for the amino acids RASVV at the C terminus, and the construct was expressed and purified by standard procedures (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). It was phosphorylated by incubating 14 µg of the protein with ∼25 units of protein kinase A (Sigma) and 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 100 µl of phosphorylation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 µm aprotinin, 5 µm leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 mm nitrophenyl phosphate) for 2 h at room temperature. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by washing with phosphorylation buffer using Centricon 30 filter devices (Amicon), and the probe was passed through a 0.22-µm filter just before use. A mouse brain expression library from C57 black mice (Stratagene) was plated, protein expression was induced, and the sample was transferred to nitrocellulose filters as described (23Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The filters were washed 3–4 times in wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithioerythritol) until all visible cell debris was removed. The filters were blocked for 1–2 h with 5% fat-free dry milk dissolved in wash buffer. They were washed and then incubated with the probe overnight under constant agitation in binding buffer at 4 °C (wash buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 µg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4). The filters were washed for 20–30 min with wash buffer and then subjected to autoradiography. The 5′ extensions were isolated from the same brain library or from a lung library (Stratagene) by standard procedures. The GST fusion products of GRP1 fragments of GRP1 were produced as described previously (7Klarlund J.K. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To make GST-FERM,EcoRI, HindIII, and SalI restriction sites were introduced with oligonucleotides (AATTCCATGTGCCAGGTTCACCTGCTGGATGACAGAAGACTGGAGCTGCTGGTTCAGCCCAAGCTTATATCCTTATGATGTTCCTGATTATGCATGAG and GGTACACGGTCCAAGTGGACGACCTACTGTCTTCTGACCTCGACGACCAAGTCGGGTTCGAATATAGGAATACTACAAGGACTAATACGTACTCAGCT), which were inserted into EcoRI and SalI sites of pBlueScript. The HindIII fragment (nucleotides 367–1248) of pBlueScript-GRSP1 was then inserted into theHindIII site inside the oligonucleotide sequence. TheEcoRI/SalI fragment of pBlueScript-FERM was subcloned into the pGEX-5X-3 vector. For GST-CC1, two primers (CAGTGGATCCAAATGAGCAATGGCAGCCTGATATCC and GAGGAATTCCTCGCCTCCTGACCTGAGG) were used to amplify the first coiled coil fragment, which was subcloned into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX-5X-3. For GST-CC2, the PCR product with two primers (GCTCTAGATCTCTATGTATCCACTGAACATAGGCGAG and GATATCGAATTCCATTGGGGTCGTCATAGGTGG) was inserted into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-5X-3. For GST-INT, the fragment was amplified by PCR with the primers (GCTGGATCCAGAAGGCTGCCGTTGTC and GACAGATCTCGAGTCAGGACGGGCGAGTGG) and inserted into BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-5X-3. For GST-ST1, two primers (GCGCAGAATTCGAGATCTAAGTCTCTCGGAATTGAGCGA and GACCGCGTGCCACATAACTGAGAATTCCTCGAGCGATC) were used for PCR. The fragment was subcloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK. GST-ST2 was made by PCR with the primers (GCGCAGAATTCGGGATCCGACCGCGTGCCACATAACC and GAAGGCATCAAAGGCTGAGAATTCCTCGAGCGATC) and subcloning intoBamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-5X-3. The GST-fused full-length GRSP1 protein was insoluble and not used in this study. For the competition assay, 0.25 µm fusion proteins were incubated with the labeled GRP1 probe and the processed filters as described (7Klarlund J.K. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed at least twice. 105 Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the insulin receptor (CHO-T) cells were seeded on coverslips in 12-well tissue culture dishes in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The following day, the cells were transfected with 5 ng of pCMV5 encoding a construct of GRP1 containing a Myc tag at the C terminus, 100 ng of pCMV5 encoding the lung form of GRSP1 containing an HA tag at the C terminus, and 400 ng of empty pCMV5 vector using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according the manufacturer's instructions. These conditions were optimized to result in low but clearly detectable levels of expression of the proteins. Cells were incubated under serum-free conditions overnight. After stimulation with insulin, the cells were fixed by incubation with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (171 mmNaCl, 10.1 mm Na2HPO4, 3.35 mm KCl, and 1.84 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2). Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline with 10% calf serum (Buffer A) for 15 min. They were then sequentially incubated in Buffer A (all dilutions): polyclonal rabbit anti-HA peptide antiserum (2 h, 1:2000 dilution), anti-Myc antibody (2 h, 1:10), Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (1 h, 1:2000), and Alexa Fluor 546 anti-mouse IgG (1 h, 1:2000) (Molecular Probes). Images were captured with a × 40 objective on an Olympus 1 × 70 inverted microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal system. To test whether homo-oligomers of GRP1 might be present in intact cells, COS-1 cell were transfected with various ratios of the PCMV5 expression vector coding for GRP1 with an HA or a Myc tag attached to the C-terminal parts of the molecule. Cells were lysed and then immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies. The conditions were optimized such that almost complete precipitation of the molecules was achieved. As is seen in Fig.1, HA-tagged GRP1 was readily observed by Western blotting in anti-HA precipitates, and mycGRP1 was clearly seen in anti-Myc precipitates. Importantly, no Myc-GRP1 was evident in anti-HA precipitates, and no HA-GRP1 was evident in anti-Myc precipitates. Similar experiments were performed with HA-labeled GRP1 and Myc-labeled cytohesin-1, and again no co-immunoprecipitation was evident (data not shown). These experiments do not support the existence of a tight interaction between GRP1 molecules or between GRP1 and cytohesin-1 molecules in intact cells, although small amounts of such oligomers might escape detection. ARNO expressed inEscherichia coli was reported to elute with an apparent molecular size of 90 kDa in gel filtration columns (24Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). It is possible that dimerization is a unique property of ARNO. Alternatively, dimers could form as a consequence of the very high expression levels attained in bacteria. Also divergence from a globular shape can lead to overestimation of molecular weights of proteins by gel filtration. We next addressed the question of whether GRP1 might interact with other cellular proteins. A cAMP-dependent protein kinase site was created at the C terminus of GST fusions of the GRP1 molecule, and it was phosphorylated by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and the kinase. The probe was used to screen a brain expression library, and a clone containing an open reading frame coding for a protein of 112 kDa was isolated. The clone was GRSP1. A protein identical to the lung form of GRSP1 except for two conserved and two nonconserved amino acid differences has been deposited in GenBankTM (gi: 11022657). Because this was isolated from a different mouse strain, the differences may represent allelic variation. Also similar sequences have been described from human brain (gi: 4589676, 7242943, 89922287, and 13628895). In addition, a short sequence of this protein has previously been observed in PC12 cells transfected with an antisense acetylcholinesterase construct (25Grifman M. Galyam N. Seidman S. Soreq H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13935-13940Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). An antibody was prepared against GRSP1, various tissues were examined for the expression of GRSP1 by Western blotting, and significant amounts of immunoreactivity were found in brain and lung (Fig.2A). Interestingly these tissues also express high amounts of GRP1 as detected by Western blotting. 2J. K. Klarlund and M. P. Czech, unpublished data. A protein with an apparent molecular size of 125 kDa was specifically recognized by the anti-GRSP1 antibody in lung. An extension of the cDNA was isolated from a lung library that had an in-frame stop codon that would yield a protein with a predicted molecular size of 115 kDa. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from lung confirmed the presence of the extension in lung tissue (data not shown). The predicted molecular size is slightly smaller than predicted by the Western blot, but we note that the protein migrated with an apparent molecular size of ∼125 kDa when expressed in COS-1 cells (Fig.5A). An extended cDNA clone from brain was also isolated. The sequence was similar up to the initiating methionine but diverged sharply thereafter, indicating the presence of an alternatively spliced variant of GRSP1 in brain. These results are consistent with the detection of a 225-kDa protein that reacts with anti-GRSP1 antibody in brain (Fig. 2 A), but we cannot exclude the possibility that this species is a cross-reacting protein rather than a splice variant.Figure 5Association of GRP1 and GRSP1 in COS-1 cells and lung tissue. GRP1 and GRSP1 were co-transfected into COS-1 cells and immunoprecipitated (IP) with the indicated antibodies (A). The presence of GRP1 and GRSP1 in the precipitates (Prcpt) was determined by Western blotting. Lung tissue from mice was homogenized and precipitated with either anti-GRP1 or anti-GRSP1 antibodies, and the supernatants (sup) and pellets were blotted with the same antibodies (B).NIS denotes lysates precipitated with the IgG fraction from a nonimmunized rabbit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Examination of the GRSP1 cDNA clone revealed the presence of several identifiable protein-protein interaction motifs (26Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). A FERM domain was identified at the N terminus. This domain was originally found in the erythrocyte band 4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, and merlin. It has since been discovered in several classes of tyrosine phosphatases, JAK, and the focal adhesion kinase, and it is involved in protein-protein interactions (27Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 751-769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bretcher A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 29Pearson M.A. Reczek D.

In addition, two regions have a high probability of forming coiled coil structures according to the coils program (22Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the site of interaction of GRP1 with GRSP1, we designed a GRP1 domain competition assay. The isolated λ-cDNA clone coding for GRSP1 (corresponding to amino acids 57–981) was plated on bacterial cell lawns, blotted to nitrocellulose filters, and incubated with the 32P-labeled GST-GRP1 protein. A series of unlabeled GST fusion proteins containing various regions of GRP1 was included in the incubations (Fig.3A). As expected, inclusion of the entire GRP1 molecule resulted in marked reduction of the signal compared with that seen without a competitor (Fig. 3 B). Also inclusion of a GST fusion protein with just the N-terminal 56 residues completely abolished binding of labeled GST-GRP1, whereas constructs containing the sec7 domain or the PH domain had no effect on the signal. We conclude that the site of interaction of GRP1 with GRSP1 is at the N-terminal coiled coil domain of GRP1. By the same approach, six GST fusion proteins of GRSP1 spanning amino acids 7–981 were analyzed (Fig. 4A), and the region of interaction was identified to be included in a GST fusion protein with amino acids 350–443 of GRSP1, which contains the coiled coil domain 1 (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Mapping of the site of interaction of GRSP1 with GRP1.

Immunoprecipitation was performed either with the GRP1 antibody or the anti-GRSP1 antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. As is seen in Fig.5 A, a clear signal from GRSP1 was seen in anti-GRP1 immunoprecipitates, and likewise GRP1 was present in GRSP1 precipitates. No co-precipitation was observed when COS-1 cells were transfected separately and the extracts subsequently mixed, indicating that the association is not a postlysis event. The observation that lung tissue contains substantial amounts of both GRSP1 and GRP1 allowed us to test whether complexes of endogenous GRP1·GRSP1 occur in intact tissue. The tissue was homogenized, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed for presence of GRP1 and GRSP1. As is seen in Fig. 5 B, cross-precipitation by the antibodies was clearly evident. The conditions were chosen such that a majority of the GRP1 and GRSP1 present was precipitated. Interestingly, whereas the GRSP1 antibody precipitated only a small amount of the GRP1 present in the total lysate, anti-GRP1 antibody precipitated GRSP1 almost quantitatively. This indicates that most of the GRSP1 is complexed with GRP1 in lung tissue, whereas the majority of GRP1 exists either free or complexed to other proteins. To determine the subcellular localization of GRSP1, a construct containing a C-terminal HA tag was prepared and transfected into CHO-T cells. In cells expressing low amounts of the construct, the protein was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm, and when co-expressed with Myc-tagged GRP1, the two proteins appeared to have a similar disperse localization (Fig.6A). In cells expressing high amounts of GRSP1, it was primarily localized in intracellular globular structures, but because artifactual localization is common under such conditions, the significance of this observation is unclear. Ruffles are readily induced in CHO-T cell by stimulation with insulin, and we have previously reported that GRP1 translocates to the plasma membrane ruffles in these cells (10Langille S.E. Patki V. Klarlund J.K. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27099-27104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Importantly, co-translocation and co-localization of GRP1 and GRSP1 is clearly evident in ruffles of cells expressing both proteins (Fig. 6 A). In further experiments, it was found as expected that both GRSP1 and GRP1 co-localized with F-actin in membrane ruffles of insulin-treated CHO-T cells (Fig. 6 B). Control experiments demonstrated that the green fluorescent protein, which is constitutively cytoplasmic, is not translocated to ruffles when co-expressed with GRP1. Translocation of GRP1 and its isoforms has mainly been studied in systems that overexpress the GRP1 family of proteins. By saturating binding sites for endogenous GRP1-binding proteins, such experimental systems presumably overemphasize analysis of the properties of free GRP1 molecules. A prevalent model is that free GRP1 molecules translocate simply as a result of binding to phosphoinositides generated by agonists in the plasma membrane. However, the observation that 50% of ARNO is found in the particulate fraction in several cell lines suggests that a significant fraction of the GRP1 family of proteins does not exist as free molecules (9Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Indeed, localization may be determined by the properties of binding partners; the complete cytohesin-1 molecule translocates to the plasma membrane in agonist-stimulated CHO-T cells, but the isolated PH domain does not (20Klarlund J.K. Tsiaras W. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32816-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, there appears to be an interaction between either the sec7 or the coiled coil domain with some cellular component that mediates the movement. Munc13–1 is a presynaptic protein that is translocated to diacylglycerol-containing membranes in presynaptic active zones. Because it has been demonstrated to bind cytohesin-1, it may possibly function as an adaptor to target cytohesin-1 to diacylglycerol in membranes rather than to phosphoinositides (30Neeb A. Koch H. Schurmann A. Brose N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Brose N. Rosenmund C. Rettig J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). GRASP is a very recently described protein that appears to anchor GRP1 to the plasma membrane in a constitutive manner (32Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Hansen S.G. Dowell P. Hruby D.E. Dawson M.I. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16827-16836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because GRASP appears to be constitutively present at the plasma membrane, it remains an interesting issue whether its GRP1 binding activity is regulated in any way to mediate the observed agonist-induced translocation of GRP1. The primary role of the GRP1 family of molecules may be to serve as parts of larger signaling complexes. It is noteworthy that the GRP1 family of molecules probably has 10–15 members. The greatest sequence heterogeneity is in the coiled coil domain, which serves to anchor these proteins to binding partners (30Neeb A. Koch H. Schurmann A. Brose N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Hansen S.G. Dowell P. Hruby D.E. Dawson M.I. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16827-16836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that the individual members may be part of distinct complexes. This, together with the observation that at least some of the GRP1-like proteins exist in forms with great differences in phosphoinositide binding specificities (20Klarlund J.K. Tsiaras W. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32816-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), suggests that they participate in a wide range of biological functions. A primary objective of future studies is to determine the function of GRSP1 signaling in association with GRP1."

We have shown previously that secretory nonpancreatic (snp) and cytosolic (c) phospholipase A2 (PLA2) regulate NF-κB activation in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or interleukin (IL)-1β activation and that a functional coupling mediated by the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) metabolite leukotriene B4 (LTB4) exists between snpPLA2and cPLA2 in human keratinocytes. In this study, we have further investigated the mechanisms of PLA2-modulated NF-κB activation with respect to specific kinases involved in TNF-α/IL-1β-stimulated cPLA2phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors RO 31-8220, Gö 6976, and a pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor of atypical PKCs attenuated arachidonic acid release, cPLA2 phosphorylation, and NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α or IL-1β, thus indicating atypical PKCs in cPLA2regulation and transcription factor activation.

Furthermore, λ/ιPKC and cPLA2 phosphorylation was attenuated by phosphatidyinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitors, which also reduced NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α and IL-1β, indicating a role for PI3-kinase in these processes in human keratinocytes. TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of λ/ιPKC was attenuated by inhibitors toward snpPLA2 and 5-LO and by an LTB4 receptor antagonist, suggesting λ/ιPKC as a downstream effector of snpPLA2 and 5-LO/LTB4 the LTB4 receptor. Hence, λ/ιPKC regulates snpPLA2/LTB4-mediated cPLA2 activation, cellular arachidonic acid release, and NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α and IL-1β. In addition, our results demonstrate that PI3-kinase and λ/ιPKC are involved in cytokine-induced cPLA2 and NF-κB activation, thus identifying λ/ιPKC as a novel regulator of cPLA2.

PLA2s cleave the fatty acid substituent from thesn-2 position of membrane phospholipids leading to production of platelet-activating factor, lysophosphatidic acid, and arachidonic acid (AA). AA is metabolized to the bioactive eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, hydroxy fatty acids, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes, whose action is in part mediated by cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors (1Metters K.M.

Group IV cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) consists of three human paralogs (12Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), of which cPLA2α, herein denoted cPLA2, is ubiquitously expressed. CPLA2 is essential for prostaglandin, leukotriene, and platelet-activating factor formation, as determined, e.g. in cPLA2knock-out mice (13Bonventre J.V. Huang Z. Taheri M.R. O'Leary E. Li E.

Activation of cPLA2 upon cellular stimulation is mediated by Ca2+-dependent translocation to membranes and by phosphorylations catalyzed by MAP kinase cascades (14Leslie C.C. J. Biol.

Many genes that are implicated in the initiation of inflammatory processes are regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB,e.g. inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α), chemokines (IL-8), and the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (16Kopp E.B. Ghosh S. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered in an inactive form in cytosol bound to its inhibitor, IκB. Following cellular activation by inflammatory cytokines, e.g. TNF-α and IL-1β, UV irradiation, or bacterial products, IκB is phosphorylated and proteolytically degraded, leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB. The signaling cascades emerging from TNF-α and IL-1 receptor 1 leading to NF-κB activation are in part understood and involve receptor-associated proteins of the TNF-α receptor-associated protein family (TRAF) (17Rothe M.

Treatment of the cells was carried out 2 days after reaching confluency. Treated cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed, and luciferase activities were determined using the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and Turner Luminometer model TD-20/20 (Turner Designs) as described by the manufacturer. NIH-3T3 and HaCaT cells were cultured in DMEM (with 4.5 or 1 g of glucose/liter for NIH-3T3 and HaCaT, respectively) and 10% FCS to 50% confluency (NIH-3T3) or to 2 days post-confluency (HaCaT). Cells were labeled for 16 h with [3H]AA (0.4 μCi/ml) in DMEM culture medium containing 0.5% FCS. About 90% of the added [3H]AA was incorporated by this procedure. After labeling, the cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline containing fatty acid-free BSA (2 mg/ml) in order to remove unincorporated radioactivity. Cells were then allowed to equilibrate at 37 °C before addition of indicated reagents. Treatments were carried out in the presence of fatty acid-free BSA (0.1 mg/ml). After the indicated times, the supernatants were cleared of detached cells by centrifugation (300 × g, 10 min). The release of [3H]AA from the cells was assessed by liquid scintillation counting. Adherent cells were dissolved in 1m NaOH in order to determine incorporated [3H]AA in the cells by liquid scintillation counting. The results are given as released [3H]AA in the supernatant relative to total [3H]AA incorporated into the cells. NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM with 4.5 g of glucose/liter and 10% FCS to 50% confluency in 6-round multiwell plates and starved in 0.5% FCS-containing DMEM for 24 h. Stimulated NIH-3T3 cells were scraped into lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.34m sucrose, 0.8 mm Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin), homogenized by 10 passes through a 26-gauge needle, and centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). For each sample, 70 μg of total protein of the supernatant was assayed for cPLA2activity using sonicated vesicles of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine (100 μm) containing 100,000 cpm of 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 80 μmCa2+, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA as described (28Thommesen L.

HaCaT cells were seeded in 100-mm plates (8 × 106 cells/plate) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.3 mg/ml glutamine, 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin, and 10% FCS. Two days after reaching confluency the cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% FCS and 0.1 mg/ml BSA for 16 h. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation with anti-λ/ιPKC or anti-cPLA2 were performed as described previously (29Anthonsen M.W. Solhaug A. Johansen B. J. Biol.

After separation of immunocomplexes on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS minigel, followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (85 V for 4 h in 20% ethanol, 190 mm glycine, 25 mmTris), 32P-phosphorylated λ/ιPKC or cPLA2was visualized by digital imaging and quantification of 32P (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In order to relate amounts of32P-phosphorylated λ/ιPKC/cPLA2 to total amount of λ/ιPKC/cPLA2, Western blot analysis using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed after visualization of32P-λ/ιPKC/[32P]cPLA2 as described (29Anthonsen M.W.

Protein levels were quantified using the NIH program Image, version 1.61. After normalization to λ/ιPKC or cPLA2 protein levels, 32P incorporation into λ/ιPKC/cPLA2 was expressed as fold induction relative to untreated cells. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in lysis buffer consisting of 0.1m Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C. After precipitating cell debris by centrifugation (300 × g for 10 min), supernatant protein concentration was determined, and anti-p85 or anti-p110γ PI3-kinase antibodies were added to supernatants having equal protein amounts. After overnight incubation, 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added before further incubation for 90 min at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed twice with 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, twice with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm LiCl, 100 μm Na3VO4, and twice with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 100 μm Na3VO4 as described (36Castan I.

Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in assay buffer containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, a mixture of phosphatidylinositol (0.2 mg/ml) and phosphatidylserine (0.1 mg/ml), and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi). After 15 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped with 4 m HCl and ethanol/chloroform (1:1). Phospholipids in the organic phase was recovered and separated on silica gel TLC plates (Silica Gel 60) coated with 1% KOH/oxalate by migration in ethanol, chloroform, H2O, 25% NH4OH (45:35:7:3). 32P incorporated as phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was detected and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).

In the figures the asterisks indicate that values are statistically significant from the given reference values. PKC and MAP kinases have been implicated in cytokine-induced NF-κB activation in several cell types (37Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3044-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To investigate this in human HaCaT keratinocytes, the effects of PKC and MAP kinase inhibitors on TNF-α/IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation were examined. The PKC inhibitor RO 31-8220 and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 dose-dependently inhibited TNF-α- and IL-1β-stimulated NF-κB activation (Fig.1 A), indicating the participation of PKC and p38 MAP kinases in cytokine-elicited NF-κB activation. In contrast, the p42/44 MAP kinase inhibitor PD 98059 did not affect cytokine-induced NF-κB activation (data not shown). It has been demonstrated that RO 31-8220, in addition to its inhibitory effects on PKC isoforms, may inhibit the activity of p70 S6 kinase (p70rsk) (40Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we examined whether rapamycin, an inhibitor of the p70rskpathway (41Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 42Morice W.G. Wiederrecht G. Brunn G.J. Siekierka J.J. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22737-22745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), impaired NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α or IL-1β. Pretreatment of HaCaT cells with 1 nm to 1 μm rapamycin had no significant effect on NF-κB activation (data not shown). Thus, the observed inhibitory effects of RO 31-8220 on TNF-α/IL-1β-induced AA signaling and NF-κB activation in HaCaT keratinocytes can be attributed to inhibition of PKC enzymes, independent of rapamycin-sensitive pathways. The PKC inhibitors RO 31-8220 and Gö 6976 preferentially inhibit conventional PKC isoenzymes (α, β, and γ) and novel PKCs (δ, ε, and τ) with much greater efficacy (IC50 values in the nm range) than atypical PKCs (IC50 values in μm range (43Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar)). Both RO 31-8220 and Gö 6976 had significant inhibitory effects on TNF-α/IL-1β-elicited NF-κB activation only at 1 and 5 μm (Fig. 1, data not shown). Also, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in a wide range of concentrations failed to activate NF-κB in HaCaT cells, indicating that PMA-insensitive atypical PKCs are involved in NF-κB activation in keratinocytes. Therefore, to examine if atypical PKCs participate in TNF-α/IL-1β-elicited NF-κB activation, we investigated cytokine-induced NF-κB activation in the presence of a cell-permeable myristoylated pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor toward atypical PKCs (43Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 44House C. Kemp B.E. Cell. Signal. 1990; 2: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor, mimicking a conserved sequence in atypical PKCs (λ/ιPKC and ζPKC), profoundly inhibited TNF-α- or IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation with more efficient inhibition at increasing concentrations (Fig. 1 B), exerting similar inhibitory effects as observed for ζPKC-mediated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes (43Standaert M.L.

Inhibitors or vehicles alone had no effect on κB-dependent transcription (data not shown). Thus, these results indicate that atypical PKCs and p38 MAP kinase are involved in TNF-α/IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation in human HaCaT keratinocytes. To examine if PKCs regulate PLA2 enzymes in HaCaT cells, we examined the effects of RO 31-8220 and the atypical PKC pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor on cellular AA mobilization. Both inhibitors dose-dependently impaired IL-1β-elicited AA release (Fig.2 A), indicating that atypical PKCs act upstream of AA releasing PLA2 enzymes. We have previously shown that TNF-α- and IL-1β-stimulated AA release from HaCaT cells is accompanied by cPLA2 phosphorylation (29Anthonsen M.W. Solhaug A. Johansen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of cPLA2 is important for its activation and AA releasing activity in response to cytokines (45Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M.

To determine if the inhibitory effect of RO 31-8220 on AA mobilization correlated with reduced phosphorylation of cPLA2, we analyzed cPLA2 phosphorylation levels by in vivophosphorylation experiments. HaCaT cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and pretreated with RO 31-8220 before addition of IL-1β. Treatment with TNF-α or IL-1β for 1 h resulted in 2–4-fold increase in cPLA2phosphorylation as reported previously (29Anthonsen M.W. Solhaug A. Johansen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and IL-1β-stimulated phosphorylation of cPLA2 was reduced in the presence of RO 31-8220 (1 μm; Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained with TNF-α (data not shown). Thes"

As shown by sedimentation velocity analysis, all CCP1/2-SP fragments were dimers (5.5–5.6 S), and all CCP2-SP fragments were monomers (3.2–3.4 S). Thus, CCP1 is essential to the assembly of the dimer, but formation of a stable dimer is not a prerequisite for self-activation.

Following recognition of the target microorganism by its C1q subunit, internal activation of the C1 complex is mediated by C1r, a modular serine protease that first activates itself, and then activates C1s, a second serine protease that is responsible for the specific proteolytic activity of C1 toward its substrates C4 and C2. Both C1r autolytic activation and C1s activation involve limited proteolysis of a single Arg-Ile peptide bond in each protease, converting single-chain proenzymes into active proteases. Both these reactions are mediated by the C-terminal (γ-B)2 catalytic domain of C1r, a non-covalent homodimer that forms the core of the C1r-C1r dimer (5Villiers C.L. Arlaud G.J. Colomb M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4477-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Each γ-B monomer comprises, from the N terminus, two complement control protein (CCP) modules and a chymotrypsin-like serine protease domain (6Arlaud G.J. Gagnon J.

CCP modules are protein motifs of about 60 residues characterized by a β-sandwich structure with N and C termini at opposite ends of an ellipsoid shape (10Bork P. Downing A.K. Kieffer B. Campbell I.D. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 119-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This module type is particularly abundant in complement control proteins, where it occurs most frequently in tandem arrays. The solution structure of CCP module pairs has been solved by NMR spectroscopy (11Barlow P.N. Steinkasserer A. Norman D.G. Kieffer B. Wiles A.P. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol.

In addition to C1r, a number of proteases, including C1s, also feature a CCP module pair preceding a C-terminal serine protease domain, and it has been proposed that the second CCP module and the protease domain form a rigid assembly in this protein family (13Rossi V.

Indeed, the crystal structure of the C-terminal fragment from the catalytic domain of human C1s, comprising the second complement control protein module and the serine protease domain, has been solved recently, showing that the ellipsoidal CCP2 module is oriented perpendicularly to the surface of the SP domain and that this arrangement is maintained through a rigid module–domain interface (16Gaboriaud C. Rossi V. Bally V. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). An intriguing question that is central to the activation mechanism of C1 lies in the presumed ability of the C1r catalytic domains to successively adopt at least two distinct conformations allowing: (i) cleavage of the susceptible Arg-Ile bond in each monomer by the catalytic site of the neighboring monomer; and then (ii) cleavage of a C1s molecule by the active site of each monomer. Recent studies have led to a three-dimensional model of the active form of the dimeric catalytic domain of C1r, in which each active site faces opposite directions toward the outside of the dimer, and lies some 77 Å apart from the Arg446-Ile447 activation site of the other monomer (14Lacroix M. Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Chevallier S. Jaquinod M. Thielens N.M. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6270-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). According to current C1 models (17Weiss V. Fauser C. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Schumaker V.N. Hanson D. Kilchherr E. Phillips M.L.

Today. 1987; 8: 106-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), this conformation is fully consistent with the function of the active form of the protein, but appears not compatible with that of the proenzyme form, providing strong support to the hypothesis that one or several important conformational changes take place upon activation of the C1r catalytic domains. The objective of the present study was to generate well-defined recombinant material representative of the proenzyme and active forms of the C1r catalytic region, to gain precise structural and functional information about each form. For this purpose, fragments of this region, comprising either one or two CCP modules associated to the serine protease domain (CCP1/2-SP and CCP2-SP) were expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system, either under the wild-type, activable form, or stabilized in the proenzyme form. The latter species were obtained using two types of mutations, one substituting Gln for Arg at the Arg446-Ile447 bond normally cleaved upon activation (R446Q mutants) and the other converting the active site Ser637 to Ala (S637A mutants). Functional characterization of the different species shows that the wild-type fragments all undergo activation and retain full enzymatic activity, whereas all mutants are stable in the proenzyme form. Analysis by analytical ultracentrifugation indicates that the CCP1/2-SP fragments are dimers, whereas the shorter CCP2-SP fragments are monomers. Taken together, these data point out the essential role of the CCP1 module in the dimerization process and indicate that formation of a stable dimer is not a prerequisite for activation.

The absorption coefficients (A1%, 1 cm at 280 nm) used for the recombinant C1r fragments CCP1/2-SP (15.4) and CCP2-SP (14.9) were calculated from the number of Trp, Tyr, and disulfides according to Edelhoch (23Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar), using average molecular weight values of 49,900 and 40,400, respectively, as determined by mass spectrometry (see “Results”). DNA fragments encoding residues 280–688 (CCP1/2-SP) of the mature wild-type and R446Q mutant C1r protein were amplified by PCR using VentR polymerase and the pHC1r3 (8Journet A. Tosi M. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and QI mutant (24Dobó J. Gál P. Szilágyi K. Cseh S. Lörincz Z. Schumaker V. Závodszky P. J.

The sequence of the sense primer a (5′-GGTGATCACGGCTGGAAGCTGCGCTA-3′) introduced aBclI restriction site (underlined), and allowed in-frame cloning with the melittin signal peptide of the pNT-Bac expression vector (25Rossi V. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Esser A.F. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 122-129Google Scholar). The antisense primer b (5′-CCCAAGCTTTCAGTCCTCCTCCTCCA-3′) introduced anHindIII restriction site (underlined) at the 3′-end of the two PCR products. The S637A mutant fragment was generated using overlap extension as described by Ho et al. (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers c (5′-CTGCCAGGGGGATGCCGGCGGCGTTTTTGCAGTAAG-3′) and the complementary primer d were designed to replace the AGT codon for serine in the wild-type sequence by the GCC codon for alanine (boldface) and to introduce a silent NgoMI restriction site (underlined). Two PCR products were generated using the pHC1r3 cDNA as a template, with primers a and d, and c and b, respectively. The overlapping PCR products were fused together in a third PCR, including the outside primers a and b to amplify the fused mutated product. The amplified DNAs corresponding to the wild-type sequence, the R446Q and S637A mutants were purified using the Geneclean II kit (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA), digested with BclI and HindIII, and cloned into the BamHI/HindIII sites of the pNT-Bac vector. The resulting constructs were characterized by restriction mapping and checked by double-stranded DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble). DNA fragments encoding residues 358–688 of the mature wild-type, R446Q, and S637A mutant C1r protein were amplified by PCR using VentR polymerase and the corresponding CCP1/2-SP containing expression plasmids as templates. The antisense primer b was used for the three constructs and the sense primer (5′-GAAGATCTTGACTGTGGGCAGCCCCGAAA-3′) introduced aBglII restriction site (underlined) and allowed in-frame cloning with the melittin signal peptide of the pNT-Bac vector for all three fragments. The PCR products corresponding to the wild-type sequence, the R446Q and S637A mutants, were digested withBglII and HindIII, purified, and cloned into theBamHI/HindIII sites of the pNT-Bac vector. The final constructs were submitted to double-stranded DNA sequencing. The Spodoptera frugiperdainsect cells (Ready-Plaque Sf9 cells from Novagen) were routinely grown and maintained in Sf900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies Inc.). The Trichoplusia ni (High Five) insect cells were provided by Dr. Jadwiga Chroboczek (Institut de Biologie Structurale, Grenoble). These cells were maintained in TC100 medium (Life Technologies Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Dominique Dutscher SA, Brumath, France) supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies Inc.). The bacmid DNA was purified using the Qiagen midiprep purification system (Qiagen SA, Courtaboeuf, France) and used to transfect Sf9 insect cells with cellfectin in Sf900 II SFM medium (Life Technologies Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant virus particles were collected 4 days later, titered by virus plaque assay, and amplified as described by King and Possee (27King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, Ltd., London1992: 111-114Google Scholar). High Five cells (1.75 × 107 cells/175-cm2 tissue culture flask) were infected with the recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 2 in Sf900 II SFM medium at 28 °C for 48 h (wild-type species) or 72 h (R446Q and S637A mutants). The supernatants containing the CCP1/2-SP fragments were collected by centrifugation, dialyzed against 25 mm ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 9.4, and loaded at 1.5 ml/min onto a Q-Sepharose-Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (2.8 × 14 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was carried out by applying a 1.2-liter linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in the same buffer, and fractions containing the recombinant fragments were identified by Western blot analysis and dialyzed against 1.5m ammonium sulfate, 50 mm ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 9.0. Further purification was achieved by high pressure hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a TSK-phenyl 5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm) (Beckman). Elution was carried out by decreasing the ammonium sulfate concentration from 1.5 m to 0 in 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The purified fragments were dialyzed against 145 mm NaCl, 25 mmethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 9.0, and concentrated to 0.3 mg/ml by ultrafiltration on a PM-10 membrane (Amicon). The supernatants containing the CCP2-SP fragments were treated in the same way, except that elution of the Q-Sepharose-Fast Flow column was carried out by applying a 1-liter linear gradient from 0 to 350 mm NaCl and that the pH of the hydrophobic interaction chromatography buffer and of the storage buffer was decreased to 8.5. N-terminal sequence analyses were performed either on soluble proteins or after SDS-PAGE analysis and electrotransfer, using an Applied Biosystems model 477 A protein sequencer as described previously (13Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Lacroix M. Ulrich J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7311-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis of the recombinant proteins was performed using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization technique on a Voyager Elite XL instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA), under conditions described previously (14Lacroix M. Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Chevallier S. Jaquinod M. Thielens N.M. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6270-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as described previously (22Thielens N.M. Aude C.A. Lacroix M.B. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14469-14475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis and immunodetection of the recombinant proteins were performed as described (13Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Lacroix M. Ulrich J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7311-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), using a rabbit polyclonal anti-C1r antiserum (1:400 dilution). Sedimentation velocity analysis was performed using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and an AN-60 TI rotor (Beckman Instruments). Experiments were carried out at 20 °C in 145 mm NaCl, 25 mmethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 9.0 (CCP1/2-SP fragments) or pH 8.5 (CCP2-SP fragments). Protein concentrations ranged from 0.14 to 0.23 mg/ml (CCP1/2-SP fragments) and from 0.14 to 0.30 mg/ml (CCP2-SP fragments). Samples of 400 μl were loaded into 12-mm path-length double-sector cells and centrifuged at 42,000 rpm. Absorbance of the samples was recorded at 275 nm. The solvent density and viscosity were calculated as 1.00493 g/ml, and 0.0103 poise, respectively, and the partial specific volume of the proteins was estimated from the amino acid composition at 0.726 ml/g, and 0.721 ml/g for the CCP1/2-SP and CCP2-SP fragments, respectively, using the SEDNTERP program (V1.01; developed by D. B. Haynes, T. Laue, and J. Philo; available at www.bbri.org/RASMB/rasmb.html). Using the SEDFIT program (www.biochem.uthscsa.edu/auc/software), the sedimentation coefficients (s) and molecular masses (M) were modeled from the sedimentation velocity profiles with the non-interacting single component model, taking advantage of a systematic noise evaluation procedure (28Schuck P. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1503-1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 29Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The continuous distributions were obtained considering 200 particles of frictional ratio 1.25 with sedimentation coefficients comprised between 0.2 and 8.0 S, without regularization procedure (F ratio 0.5) (30Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar), and their relevance was evaluated using a Monte Carlo statistical analysis. The maximal axial ratio of the proteins was evaluated using the Teller empirical method of the SEDNTERP program, assuming a prolate ellipsoid shape and a hydration coefficient of 0.4 g of H2O/g of protein (31Teller D.C. Nature. 1976; 260: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The R446Q CCP1/2-SP mutant fragment (0.39 mg/ml) was incubated in 145 mm NaCl, 25 mm ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 9.0, for 5 h at 37 °C in the presence of thermolysin. The initial thermolysin/protein ratio was 2% (w/w), and equivalent amounts of thermolysin were added after every hour of incubation, to reach a final ratio of 10% (w/w). The CCP2-SP mutant fragment was activated under the same conditions, at pH 8.5, for 3 h using a final thermolysin/protein ratio of 6% (w/w). The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mm 1,10-phenantroline and 1 mmEDTA. Activation of proenzyme C1s was measured by incubation of the protein (4.5 μm) in the presence of activated C1r, each of the recombinant CCP1/2-SP and CCP2-SP fragments, or the thermolysin-activated R446Q mutant CCP1/2-SP and CCP2-SP fragments (protease/C1s molar ratio = 0.045 or 0.022) for various periods at 37 °C in 145 mm NaCl, 50 mmtriethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4. Activation was monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions and subsequent quantification by gel scanning of the A and B chains characteristic of activated C1s. The esterolytic activity of C1r and of its recombinant CCP1/2-SP and CCP2-SP fragments was measured on the synthetic ester Ac-Gly-Lys-OMe (Sigma Chemical Co.) using an assay based on the spectrophotometric measurement of methanol released upon hydrolysis (32Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The tests were conducted at 30 °C using substrate concentrations varying from 0.2 to 1 mm in 100 mmK2HPO4, pH 8.0. The modular structures of human C1r and of the recombinant fragments used in the present study are depicted in Fig.1. The recombinant baculoviruses for expression of the wild-type, R446Q, and S637A mutant C1r fragments were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and used to infect High Five insect cells for various periods at 28 °C. Secretion of the recombinant proteins into the culture medium was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (not shown). Under non-reducing conditions, the anti-C1r antibody labeled a band of apparent molecular mass 50 or 40 kDa in the supernatants containing the CCP1/2-SP or CCP2-SP fragments, respectively. In all cases, the band became detectable after 24 h of infection and its intensity reached a maximum at 48 h for the wild-type and R446Q species, and at 72 h for the S637A mutants. Under reducing conditions, the 50- or 40-kDa bands were still observed in the case of the R446Q and S637A mutants. In contrast, reduction of the wild-type CCP1/2-SP and CCP2-SP fragments yielded a band at 35 kDa and bands at 19 and 13 kDa, respectively, indicating that these fragments were produced in the activated, two-chain form. The concentrations of recombinant proteins in the 48/72-h culture supernatants were estimated at ∼2–4 mg/liter for all fragments. The supernatants containing the recombinant fragments were initially fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography. The wild-type and mutant fragments eluted at the same position during the ascending salt gradient, along with a major contaminant of mass 67 kDa. Final purification was achieved by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, yielding amounts of purified material of typically 0.4–1 mg/liter of culture. The recombinant fragments were essentially pure as judged from SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2). The CCP1/2-SP fragments all yielded a single band under non-reducing conditions (Fig.2A, lanes 1–3), although with quite different apparent mass values (56 and 47 kDa for the wild-type and mutant species, respectively). Under reducing conditions, both mutants retained a single-chain structure (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6) whereas, as already observed by Western blot analysis, the wild-type species yielded two chains (Fig. 2A,lane 4) corresponding to the serine protease domain (35 kDa) and the CCP1/2 moiety (19 kDa). The latter appeared as a doublet in some preparations, with a minor species migrating slightly faster than the major one. Incubation of the wild-type CCP1/2-SP fragment for periods up to 6 h at 37 °C did not significantly modify the proportion of the two species. Analysis of the shorter CCP2-SP fragments yielded comparable results, with apparent mass values of 42 and 39 kDa under non-reducing conditions for the wild-type and mutant fragments, respectively (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3), and the appearance of two chains at 35 and 13.5 kDa upon reduction of the wild-type fragment (Fig. 2B, lane 4). It was clear, therefore, that both the shorter and larger wild-type species were recovered in a fully activated, two-chain form, whereas all mutants retained a single-chain, proenzyme structure. As judged from SDS-PAGE analysis, no sign of proteolytic degradation was detected upon storage of the recombinant proteins for several months at −20 °C. Edman degradation of the purified R446Q and S637A CCP1/2-SP fragments yielded a single sequenceAsp-His-Gly-Trp-Lys-Leu-Arg-Tyr-Thr-Thr …, corresponding to the segment Gly280-Thr287 of human C1r (32Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) preceded by the two residues Asp-His expected to be added at the N terminus, due to in-frame cloning with the signal sequence of melittin (see “Experimental Procedures”) (TableI). In addition to the above sequence, the wild-type species yielded approximately equal amounts of a second sequence Ile447-Ile-Gly-Gly-Gln-Lys-Ala-Lys454 …, corresponding to the N-terminal end of the serine protease domain of C1r (6Arlaud G.J. Gagnon J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), thereby confirming that activation of the fragment had occurred through cleavage of the Arg446-Ile447bond. A third, minor sequence Tyr285-Thr-Thr-Glu-Ile-Ile-Lys291 … was also observed in some preparations, indicating partial cleavage at the Arg284-Tyr285 bond, resulting in removal of the first seven N-terminal residues of the fragment. Partial cleavage at this position was previously shown to occur upon autolytic cleavage of active C1r isolated from human serum (33Arlaud G.J. Gagnon J. Villiers C.L. Colomb M.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and this likely explains the occurrence of the minor CCP1/2 segment species observed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the reduced wild-type CCP1/2-SP fragment. Edman degradation of the purified R446Q and S637A mutant CCP2-SP fragments yielded a single sequenceAsp-Leu-Asp-Cys-Gly-Gln-Pro-Arg-Asn-Leu …, corresponding to the segment Asp358-Leu365 of human C1r (33Arlaud G.J. Gagnon J. Villiers C.L. Colomb M.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) preceded by the two residues Asp-Leu expected to be added at the N terminus, due to in-frame cloning with the signal sequence of melittin (see “Experimental Procedures”). The wild-type species also yielded a second sequence, corresponding to the N-terminal end of the serine protease domain of C1r (Table I), thereby confirming the activated state of this fragment.Table IMass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analysis of the recombinant Clr fragments used in this studyClr fragmentExperimental massCalculated massaValue derived from the amino acid sequence.Deduced mass of carbohydratesN-terminal sequencebResidues in italics were introduced due to in-frame cloning with the signal sequence of melittin (see “Experimental Procedures”).DaWild-type CCP1/2-SP49,657 ± 2546,8912766 ± 25DHGWKLRYTT… IIG GQKAK… YTTEIIK…R446Q mutant CCP1/2-SP50,079 ± 2546,8453234 ± 25DHGWKLRYTT…S637A mutant CCP1/2-SP49,974 ± 2546,8563118 ± 25DHGWKLRYTT…Wild-type CCP2-SP40,490 ± 2037,6352855 ± 20D"

In vitro folding of proteins was performed usually at low concentrations to avoid aggregation during folding; however, in the cytoplasm of cells there are a large number of soluble and insoluble macromolecules at different concentrations, sometimes at very high concentrations depending on physiological and environmental conditions. It has been estimated that the concentration of macromolecules in cytoplasm could be in the range of 80–200 g/liter (1Swaminathan R. Hwang C.P. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Therefore all species of macromolecules occupy a large fraction of the total volume of a cell and such a media has been named “crowded” (2Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). One of the consequences of crowding is steric repulsion, which derived from the mutual impenetrability of macromolecules, and has been referred to more precisely as volume exclusion (3Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 4Minton A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10577-10580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). This is the most significant difference between the intracellular and artificial in vitroenvironment but has not been considered in the majority of investigations. Very recently Ellis (5Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) suggested that the addition of crowding agents at biologically relevant concentrations to solutions should be considered as a routine variable to meet the objective in studying interactions between biological molecules under more physiologically relevant conditions.Although the biophysical theory of macromolecular crowding by thermodynamic and statistical thermodynamic approaches is well developed (3Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 4Minton A.P. J. Biol.

Colclasure G.C. Parker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10504-10506Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), there are not many biochemical experiments thus far to examine the effects of crowding on protein folding. van den Berg et al. (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) have studied the effect of crowding agents on the refolding of denatured lysozyme. Further kinetic analysis suggested that under conditions resembling the intracellular environment, the rates of many protein-folding processes are likely to be altered (10van den Berg B. Wain R. Dobson C.M. Ellis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3870-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For chaperone-assisted protein refolding, it has been reported that the release of nonnative polypeptide from GroEL was prevented in the presence of crowding agents (11Martin J. Hartl F.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), although contradictory results have also been reported that rhodanese can be released from GroEL in its nonnative form in the milieu of an intact cell (12Burston S.G. Weissman J.S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that macromolecular crowding modulates the oligomerization of GroEL during its refolding (13Galán A. Sot B. Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 957-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).In this communication we have studied the effects of polysaccharide (Ficoll 70 and Dextran 70), polyethylene glycol 20000 (PEG),1 and the protein crowding agents bovine serum albumin (BSA), chicken egg ovalbumin, and lysozyme on the refolding of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-denatured glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) at 25 and 37 °C. The results show that the renaturation yields of the two proteins do not change in the presence of high concentrations (50–200 g/liter) of crowding agents; however, the refolding kinetics change markedly. The chaperone GroEL promotes the folding and reverses the effects of crowding agents on G6PDH folding.DISCUSSIONAccording to the crowding theory, macromolecules, by excluding volume to one another, reduce the configurational entropy and hence increase the free energy of a solution and the chemical potential of each species of macrosolute present in the solution (2Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). This results in the destabilization of either reactants or products and affects equilibrium toward the most favored state of the system, which excludes the least volume to the predominant background species. Association reactions are therefore highly favored under crowding conditions with the association constants, which could be several orders of magnitude larger than those measured in dilute solutions (3Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 4Minton A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10577-10580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). In this regard van den Berg et al. (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) have reported that high concentrations of BSA, ovalbumin, Ficoll 70, and Dextran 70 almost abolish the correct refolding of reduced and denatured lysozyme because of the enhanced aggregation and increase the refolding rate (10van den Berg B. Wain R. Dobson C.M. Ellis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3870-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). They have claimed that their results are consistent with the prediction of excluded volume theory (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The observations we report in the present study on the refolding of G6PDH and PDI in the presence of crowding agents have shown a different picture.G6PDH from yeast (20Yue R.H. Noltmann E.A. Kuby S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1353-1364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PDI from bovine liver are both homodimeric molecules under the conditions of this study (only a small part of PDI exists as a homotetramer). The reactivation yields of G6PDH and PDI, depending on the protein concentration and temperature, are far from complete under the conditions used. The higher the protein concentration and the temperature, the lower the reactivation yields and the stronger the aggregation. Little large-scale aggregates during the refolding of G6PDH at 0.36 μm and PDI at 7 μm can be detected by light scattering measurements or collected by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm at 25 °C, and “soluble” aggregates of >1000 kDa characterized by gel filtration analysis form and correspond to wrongly folded and inactive molecules. The above indicates that similar to that for other proteins, which form aggregates or even precipitates during folding, aggregation during the folding of G6PDH or PDI, although mainly soluble, is also the principle competitor with correct folding and is responsible for the incomplete reactivation.Considering the association of two subunits is necessary for the reactivation of denatured G6PDH or PDI in monomeric form, the refolding kinetics are shown below in Scheme FS1.In step I (the correct folding pathway), two single unfolded or partially refolded subunits of G6PDH or PDI (U) associate to become a dimeric folding intermediate (I2). Step II depends on the conformational change from I2 through a transient state (I2*) to the native stateN2. In step III, aggregation fromU to aggregate (U′n) competes with the correct folding of steps I and II.Crowding has been suggested to affect mainly the folding of those proteins that are prone to aggregation (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) but not to create this tendency de novo (5Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Different from lysozyme, a monomeric protein that is strongly prone to aggregation, G6PDH and PDI are both dimeric molecules with a weaker tendency to aggregate. No change of the refolding yields of G6PDH and PDI in a crowding environment with 200 g/liter crowding agents may result from the combination of the two opposite effects of crowding; to enhance the self-association of monomeric subunits for the assembly of active dimeric molecules and to increase the unproductive aggregation, although not strongly. The balance between the above two pathways is kept in crowded conditions. In this regard it has been reported that crowding modulates the oligomerization of GroEL in two different ways: it increases the tendency of self-association of monomers at equilibrium and modifies the relative rates of the two competing self-association reactions, namely the productive assembly to native GroEL and unproductive aggregation (13Galán A. Sot B. Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 957-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although crowding agents strongly increase the aggregation of lysozyme, it almost abolishes its refolding. The consequential effects of crowding on the folding of a multisubunit protein depend on the properties of aggregation and association of the particular protein, and the effects differ between them.As shown in Scheme FS1, step I is a second-order reaction and depends on the encounter rate of two U monomers. StepII is a first-order reaction depending on conformational change. It has been reported that the reactivation kinetics of G6PDH at concentrations higher than 0.217 μm become a first-order reaction, and the conformational change from an inactive dimeric folding intermediate to native form is a rate-determining step (21Plomer J.J. Gafni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1993: 89-96Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The effects of crowding on diffusion and conformational change oppose each other with respect to reaction rates (5Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In theory, the maximal reaction rate possible for any bimolecular reaction has been suggested to be diffusion-controlled rather than transition state-limited when the concentration of crowding agents becomes high enough (3Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 4Minton A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10577-10580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 5Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). But it is found that the refolding kinetics of G6PDH and PDI show the feature of a first-order reaction either in dilute or crowded solution, indicating that conformational change but not association is the rate-determining step. At the same time, crowding decreases the refolding rate of oligomeric G6PDH and PDI but increases the refolding rate of monomeric reduced lysozyme (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In accordance to the excluded volume theory, we propose the following folding pathway in the presence of crowding agents to explain the experimental observations (Scheme FS1). The folding of I2 to N2 might involve an unfolding process, which results in less compactI2*, and the conformational change during the unfolding is the rate-determining step, which is unfavorable with the decreased refolding rates under crowding conditions (2Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). It has been found that in the refolding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor two key kinetic intermediates with disulfides of (30–51, 5–38) and (30–51, 5Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 731-744PubMed Google Scholar). The GroEL-assisted refolding of rhodanese was also slower in the presence of Xenopus oocyte extract but with a similar refolding yield compared with that in the absence of the extract (12Burston S.G. Weissman J.S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been assumed that the effect of crowding on reaction is complex and depends on the nature of the reaction, the species, and the concentrations of crowding agents (5Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar).The most remarkable feature of the effect of crowding agents (except BSA) on the refolding of G6PDH is to change the refolding kinetics from monophasic to biphasic of the first-order reaction. With increasing the concentration of crowding agents, the amplitude of the slow phase increases and that of the fast phase decreases but with decreased rate constants for both phases. We therefore further propose for G6PDH refolding that the presence of crowding agent results in a new folding pathway with I2′, more compact thanI2, and the unfolding barrier fromI2′ through I2′* toN2 would be higher than that fromI2 through I*2to N2 and results in a slower folding (Scheme FS2).Figure FS2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus with increasing concentrations of crowding agents, G6PDH folding intermediates would populate in the more compact stateI2′ so as to increase the amplitude of the slow phase. BSA is an exceptional crowding agent and at high concentrations keeps the refolding kinetics of G6PDH monophasic. It has been noticed that BSA affected the refolding of denatured and reduced lysozyme also differently from the other crowding agents examined, and specific protein-protein interaction has been suggested for this effect of BSA (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar).The absence of large effects of crowding on the refolding of denatured and oxidized lysozyme was suggested to be caused by the high rate of this process compared with the much slower refolding of denatured and reduced lysozyme, the refolding rate of which was increased significantly under crowding conditions (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that proteins might fold more quickly in vivo as a result of crowding, consequently making them less susceptible to aggregation (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In fact, the refolding yield of reduced lysozyme in the presence of crowding agents decreased because of aggregation even though the refolding rate was increased (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The refolding yields of G6PDH and PDI do not change but have slower folding rates under crowding conditions. It seems that effects of crowding on the reaction rate, folding yield, and aggregation of different proteins could be different.One of the strategies of living cells to combat the effects of crowding is to employ molecular chaperones as evolutionary products (23Ellis R.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R531-R533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GroEL/MgATP dramatically enhances the refolding yield of G6PDH, and crowding is not able to interfere with the assisted effect of chaperone GroEL but only decreases the folding rate, because the dissociation of the GroEL-G6PDH complex would be prevented by the crowding agents so as to retard substrate folding. BSA and Ficoll decrease the PDI-assisted refolding of lysozyme (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The effects of macromolecular crowding on chaperone-assisted refolding of different proteins also seem different. The most prominent effect of GroEL/MgATP on the refolding of G6PDH under crowding conditions observed in the present study is that GroEL “reverses” the refolding kinetics from biphasic to monophasic with the elimination of the slow phase produced by crowding agents and thus largely accelerates the refolding process compared with the spontaneous refolding under crowding conditions. Obviously, chaperones counteract the effects of crowding and function to increase the folding efficiency of proteins within cells.GroEL, as a heat shock protein, assists G6PDH refolding at 37 °C more efficiently but slower than at 25 °C, suggesting stronger binding between G6PDH and GroEL at a higher temperature (16Hansen J.E. Gafni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21632-21636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that the binding between GroEL and denatured Cys-Ala double mutant β-lactamase increased by increasing the temperature in the measured range, and higher temperatures favored the GroEL-assisted reactivation as an endothermic reaction (24Gervasoni P. Gehrig P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The effects of crowding agents on the refolding of G6PDH or PDI are similar at 25 and 37 °C showing weak temperature dependence. Actually, the refolding kinetics of lysozyme in the presence of macromolecular crowding was studied at 20 °C (10van den Berg B. Wain R. Dobson C.M. Ellis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3870-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) but not at 37 °C for studies on refolding and aggregation (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar).The macromolecular crowding is important, but unfortunately it is a largely neglected aspect of the intracellular environment (5Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). We have investigated the refolding of G6PDH and PDI under crowding conditions and proposed that folding yields could be retained at the cost of the decrease of folding rates in crowded cells for some proteins, and molecular chaperones can counteract the effects of crowding. Compared with the refolding of lysozyme under crowding conditions, it seems that the excluded volume effect on protein folding is very complex and diverse and depends on the nature of proteins, interactions, and crowding agents. In the past decades extensive studies on protein folding in vitro have provided a wealth of information for understanding how nascent polypeptides mature into functional proteins in cells and for surmounting difficulties in refolding inclusion bodies of many recombinant proteins. In vitro folding of proteins was performed usually at low concentrations to avoid aggregation during folding; however, in the cytoplasm of cells there are a large number of soluble and insoluble macromolecules at different concentrations, sometimes at very high concentrations depending on physiological and environmental conditions. It has been estimated that the concentration of macromolecules in cytoplasm could be in the range of 80–200 g/liter (1Swaminathan R. Hwang C.P. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Therefore all species of macromolecules occupy a large fraction of the total volume of a cell and such a media has been named “crowded” (2Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). One of the consequences of crowding is steric repulsion, which derived from the mutual impenetrability of macromolecules, and has been referred to more precisely as volume exclusion (3Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 4Minton A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10577-10580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). This is the most significant difference between the intracellular and artificial in vitroenvironment but has not been considered in the majority of investigations. Very recently Ellis (5Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) suggested that the addition of crowding agents at biologically relevant concentrations to solutions should be considered as a routine variable to meet the objective in studying interactions between biological molecules under more physiologically relevant conditions. Although the biophysical theory of macromolecular crowding by thermodynamic and statistical thermodynamic approaches is well developed (3Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 4Minton A.P. J. Biol.

Colclasure G.C. Parker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10504-10506Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), there are not many biochemical experiments thus far to examine the effects of crowding on protein folding. van den Berg et al. (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) have studied the effect of crowding agents on the refolding of denatured lysozyme. Further kinetic analysis suggested that under conditions resembling the intracellular environment, the rates of many protein-folding processes are likely to be altered (10van den Berg B. Wain R. Dobson C.M. Ellis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3870-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For chaperone-assisted protein refolding, it has been reported that the release of nonnative polypeptide from GroEL was prevented in the presence of crowding agents (11Martin J. Hartl F.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), although contradictory results have also been reported that rhodanese can be released from GroEL in its nonnative form in the milieu of an intact cell (12Burston S.G. Weissman J.S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that macromolecular crowding modulates the oligomerization of GroEL during its refolding (13Galán A. Sot B. Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 957-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this communication we have studied the effects of polysaccharide (Ficoll 70 and Dextran 70), polyethylene glycol 20000 (PEG),1 and the protein crowding agents bovine serum albumin (BSA), chicken egg ovalbumin, and lysozyme on the refolding of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-denatured glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) at 25 and 37 °C. The results show that the renaturation yields of the two proteins do not change in the presence of high concentrations (50–200 g/liter) of crowding agents; however, the refolding kinetics change markedly. The chaperone GroEL promotes the folding and reverses the effects of crowding agents on G6PDH folding. DISCUSSIONAccording to the crowding theory, macromolecules, by excluding volume to one another, reduce the configurational entropy and hence increase the free energy of a solution and the chemical potential of each species of macrosolute present in the solution (2Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). This results in the destabilization of either reactants or products and affects equilibrium toward the most favored state of the system, which excludes the least volume to the predominant background species. Association reactions are therefore highly favored under crowding conditions with the association constants, which could be several orders of magnitude larger than those measured in dilute solutions (3Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 4Minton A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10577-10580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). In this regard van den Berg et al. (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) have reported that high concentrations of BSA, ovalbumin, Ficoll 70, and Dextran 70 almost abolish the correct refolding of reduced and denatured lysozyme because of the enhanced aggregation and increase the refolding rate (10van den Berg B. Wain R. Dobson C.M. Ellis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3870-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). They have claimed that their results are consistent with the prediction of excluded volume theory (9van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The observations we report in the present study on the refolding of G6PDH and PDI in the presence of crowding agents have shown a different picture.G6PDH from yeast (20Yue R.H. Noltmann E.A.

Csk expression and kinase activity were abundant in normal human breast tissues, breast carcinomas, and breast cancer cell lines, whereas CHK expression was negative in normal breast tissues and low in some breast tumors and in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. CHK kinase activity was not detected in human breast carcinoma tissues (12 of 12) or in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (due to the low level of CHK protein expression), but was significantly induced upon heregulin (HRG) stimulation. We have previously shown that CHK associates with the ErbB-2/neu receptor upon HRG stimulationvia its SH2 domain and that it down-regulates the ErbB-2/neu-activated Src kinases. Our new findings demonstrate that Csk has no effect on ErbB-2/neu-activated Src kinases upon HRG treatment and that its kinase activity is not modulated by HRG. CHK significantly inhibited in vitro cell growth, transformation, and invasion induced upon HRG stimulation. In addition, tumor growth of wt CHK-transfected MCF-7 cells was significantly inhibited in nude mice. Furthermore, CHK down-regulated c-Src and Lyn protein expression and kinase activity, and the entry into mitosis was delayed in the wt CHK-transfected MCF-7 cells upon HRG treatment. These results indicate that CHK, but not Csk, is involved in HRG-mediated signaling pathways, down-regulates ErbB-2/neu-activated Src kinases, and inhibits invasion and transformation of breast cancer cells upon HRG stimulation. These findings strongly suggest that CHK is a novel negative growth regulator of HRG-mediated ErbB-2/neu and Src family kinase signaling pathways in breast cancer cells.

The majority of breast carcinomas appear to be sporadic and become increasingly aggressive due to the acquisition of several successive, distinct genetic changes (2Dankort D.L. Muller W.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In many cases, random onset of human breast cancer has been correlated with increased expression of the growth factor receptor ErbB-2/neu (also known as HER-2) (3Menard S. Tagliabue E. Campiglio M. Pupa S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and with the increased activity of the Src family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (4Muthuswamy S.K. Siegel P.M. Dankort D.L. Webster M.A. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpression of ErbB-2/neu is directly involved in mammary tumorigenesis and correlates with a poor prognosis in breast cancer (3Menard S. Tagliabue E. Campiglio M. Pupa S.M. J. Cell.

Oncol. 1999; 26: 51-59PubMed Google Scholar). To date, no ligands that directly bind to the ErbB-2/neu receptor have been clearly identified. However, heterodimerization of ErbB-2/neu with other members of the EGF receptor family, the EGF receptor (or c-ErbB-1) and ErbB-3 (or c-HER-3), confers high affinity binding sites for EGF and heregulin (HRG) (also known as neu differentiation factor), respectively (6Wada T.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1801-1810PubMed Google Scholar), that contain SH2 domains and also play a role in signal transduction pathways. Activation of Src family kinases in response to growth factor stimulation constitutes an essential step in the initiation of the mitogenic signal generated by several receptor tyrosine kinases (12Thomas S.M.

Like Csk, CHK contains Src homology (SH) domains 2 and 3, as well as the Src family catalytic domain (SH1), and lacks an amino-terminal myristoylation signal residue and is therefore localized to the cytoplasm. Additionally, like Csk, CHK phosphorylates in vitro the inhibitory carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of several Src family kinases, including c-Src (23Davidson D. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. J. Biol.

It has been shown that the SH2 domain of CHK binds to several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. These proteins include the activated protein-tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit in megakaryocytes (29Jhun B.H. Rivnay B. Price D. Avraham H. J. Biol.

Mikhael A. McVicar D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that CHK expression was observed in primary human breast cancer specimens (70 of 80) by immunofluorescence staining but was not detected in normal human breast tissues (none of 19). Confocal microscopy analysis revealed co-localization of CHK with the ErbB-2/neu receptor in these primary breast cancer specimens (6 of 6) (33Zrihan-Licht S. Lim J. Keydar I. Sliwkowski M.X.

Furthermore, upon HRG stimulation of breast cancer cells, CHK associated with the HER-2/neu receptor (33Zrihan-Licht S. Lim J. Keydar I. Sliwkowski M.X. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1856-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This association was receptor-specific (ErbB-2/neu) and ligand-specific (HRG), because no association was detected with the ErbB-2/EGF-receptor heterodimer upon EGF stimulation. CHK bound directly, via its SH2 domain, to the Tyr1253autophosphorylation site of ErbB-2/neu (33Zrihan-Licht S. Lim J. Keydar I. Sliwkowski M.X. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol.

The autophosphorylated tyrosine residues Tyr1253 of rodent neu and Tyr1248 of the human homologue ErbB-2 have been reported to be the most critical residues for the oncogenicity and transforming potential of ErbB-2/neu (35Ben-Levy R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3302-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Moreover, CHK was able to down-regulate ErbB-2/neu-activated c-Src kinase (34Zrihan-Licht S. Deng B. Yarden Y. McShan G. Keydar I. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4065-4072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the expression, kinase activities, and functions of Csk and CHK in primary human breast tumors, normal breast tissues, and breast cancer cell lines. Csk was highly expressed and kinase-active in both primary human breast cancer tissues and normal breast tissues, but its expression and kinase activity were not modulated by HRG. In contrast, CHK expression was observed in only some breast cancer tissues at low levels and was not detected in normal breast tissues. Moreover, CHK kinase activity could not be detected in these samples (due to the low level of CHK protein expression). However, upon stimulation with HRG, CHK kinase activity was significantly induced. We further studied CHK function in HRG-mediated signaling and evaluated the anti-tumoral potential of overexpressing wild-type (wt) CHK protein in MCF-7 cells by stable transfection. We showed that overexpression of wt CHK significantly inhibited in vitro cell growth, transformation, and invasion induced upon HRG stimulation of MCF-7 cells. Tumor growth of wt CHK-transfected MCF-7 cells in nude mice was also significantly inhibited. In addition, in vitro c-Src and Lyn protein expression and kinase activities were down-regulated, and entry into mitosis was delayed in wt CHK-transfected MCF-7 cells. Taken together, these data indicate that CHK, but not Csk, is involved in HRG-mediated signaling and is potentially a novel negative growth regulator of this signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. Human megakaryocytic cells (Dami, MEG-01), normal breast cells (MCF-10A, HBL-100), and breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and ZR-75-1) were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). Primary human breast tissues were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (Eastern Division, Philadelphia, PA). Prior to stimulation with HRG, cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium and for an additional 4 h in fresh serum-free medium, then were induced with 10 nm HRG for 10 min. Recombinant human HRG (γHRG-β1, 177–244) was generously provided by Dr. Mark X. Sliwkowski (Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA) (36Levi A.D. Bunge R.P. Lofgren J.A. Meima L. Hefti F. Nikolics K. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from primary human breast cancer tissues and human breast cell lines was prepared by a standard protocol of lysis in guanidium isothiocyanate, followed by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA was isolated, and CHK sequences were amplified by RT-PCR with degenerate oligonucleotide primers, as described previously (16Bennett B.D. Cowley S. Jiang S. London R. Deng B. Grabarek J. Groopman J.E. Goeddel D.V. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1068-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products of the amplifiedCHK were purified from the agarose gel, ligated into pUC19, and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, as described previously (16Bennett B.D. Cowley S. Jiang S. London R. Deng B. Grabarek J. Groopman J.E. Goeddel D.V. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1068-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method using a Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). PCR products prepared as described above were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel, denatured, neutralized, transferred to filters, and vacuum-blotted. The filters were baked at 80 °C for 2 h and then prehybridized according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probes used were the full-lengthCHK and Csk cDNAs, which were labeled by random priming as described previously (16Bennett B.D. Cowley S. Jiang S. London R. Deng B. Grabarek J. Groopman J.E. Goeddel D.V. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1068-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out as described previously (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) at 42 °C in buffer containing 50% (v/v) formamide. The blotted membrane was washed (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) at 62 °C and then subjected to autoradiography. For Western blot analyses, cells were scraped off the plates and lysed in cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol) containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate inhibitor for 45 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a protein assay (Bio-Rad). 50 μg of total protein extracts were electrophoretically separated on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with antibodies against CHK (Lsk, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Csk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Src (clone GD11, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), Lyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and actin (clone-4, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunodetection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild-type humanCHK cDNA (1.6 kilobase pairs) was cloned into the pcDNA3-neo mammalian expression vector with the FLAG epitope introduced to the 5′-end of the open reading frame of theCHK cDNA as previously described (33Zrihan-Licht S. Lim J. Keydar I. Sliwkowski M.X. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1856-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The lysine (AAG) to arginine (GCG) mutation at position 262 in the ATP-binding site of the kinase domain of CHK (dead-kinase) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene, with the sense primer 5′-GGGCAAAAGGTGGCCGTGGCGAATATCAAGTGTGATGTG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CACATCACACTTGATATTCGCCACGGCCACCTTTTGCCC-3′. Transfection of MCF-7 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfected cells were selected in 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.). Positive transfectants were chosen based on their immunoreactivity on Western blots probed with polyclonal anti-CHK (Lsk, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibodies. MCF-7 cells (105 cells/well) were spread in 24-well plates and starved in serum-free medium. Cells were then grown in serum-free medium alone or supplemented with 10 nm HRG. Viable cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Staining was recovered with 2% deoxycholate and quantitated by spectrophotometry (490 nm). Transformation of cells was assessed by their ability to demonstrate anchorage-independent growth (38Rosenthal A. Lindquist P.B. Bringman T.S. Goeddel D.V. Derynck R. Cell. 1986; 46: 301-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well dishes) were seeded in medium containing 0.3% agar (Sigma) and allowed to grow for 2 weeks before counting viable colonies (3 cells or more per colony). The Matrigel invasion assay was performed as previously described (39Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) using 6.5-mm Transwell chambers (8-μm pore size, Costar). Matrigel was diluted in cold distilled water (2 μg/ml), added to the upper wells of the Transwell chambers, and dried in a sterile hood. The Matrigel was reconstituted with medium for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of cells. Cells were starved in serum-free medium, then resuspended at a concentration of 1–2 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, alone or supplemented with 10 nm HRG. 100 μl of the cell suspension was added to each well, and conditioned NIH 3T3 medium (600 μl) was added to the bottom wells of the chambers. After 18 h, the cells that had not invaded were removed from the upper surface of the filters using cotton swabs. The cells that had invaded to the lower surface of the filters were fixed with methanol, stained with 0.2% crystal violet, and counted. MCF-7 tumors were induced in 7- to 8-week-old female athymic nu/nu Swiss mice on day 0 by subcutaneous injection of 107 cells into the mammary fat pad (n = 6 animals for each group). Tumors were measured in three orthogonal dimensions every 5 days, and volumes were estimated assuming an ellipsoid shape as follows: (a × b × c)/2. Differences between tumors were compared using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney non-parametric rank test (two-sided). For Western blot analysis, mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiment (day 60) by cervical dislocation. Tumors were taken after skin incision using scissors and forceps, and total protein extracts were prepared and analyzed as described above (see “Western Blot Analysis”). Primary human breast tissues were dissected and homogenized in cell lysis buffer (same as above). Human cells were starved in serum-free medium, then were unstimulated or stimulated with 10 nm HRG for 10 min, and total protein extracts were prepared as described above (see “Western Blot Analysis”). Next, 1 mg of protein was immunoprecipitated using antibodies against CHK (Lsk, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Csk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Src (clone GD11, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), and Lyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing anti-protease and anti-phosphatase inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), 0.2 mg/ml poly(Glu/Tyr)4:1 (Sigma) as an exogenous substrate, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer and resolved on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. The labeled poly(Glu/Tyr) was excised from the gel and radioactivity was counted. MCF-7 cells were starved in serum-free medium, then stimulated with 10% fetal bovine serum and harvested by trypsin/EDTA digestion after two washes with phosphate-buffered saline. 1–2 × 106 cells/ml were fixed with 50% ice-cold methanol for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 300 ×g for 5 min, cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of staining solution containing 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 100 units/ml RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) at the Core Flow Cytometry Facility of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle (G1, S, and G2/M) was calculated with ModFitLT cell cycle analysis software (Verity Software House). To analyze CHK and Csk functions in breast cancer, their expression and kinase activities in normal and malignant breast tissues and cell lines were evaluated. We showed here by RT-PCR and Southern blotting that normal human breast tissues were negative for CHK, whereas breast cancer tissues expressed CHK (Fig.1 A). Csk expression was abundant in both normal breast and tumoral breast tissues (Fig.1 A). In addition, Csk protein was highly expressed while CHK protein was detected at low levels in only some of the tumors by Western blot analyses (Fig. 1 B) and immunofluorescence staining (data not shown). We then analyzed the kinase activities of the Csk and CHK proteins extracted from primary human breast carcinomas that were found to express Csk and CHK, as shown by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). We did not detect any CHK activity in the 12 different human breast tumors analyzed, whereas Csk kinase activity was very high (Fig. 1 C). Upon examining human breast cell lines, we found that the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 expressed CHK as detected by RT-PCR and Southern blotting (Fig. 2 A) and Western blotting (Fig. 2 B), although the expression level of CHK in MCF-7 cells was about 10-fold less than that found in megakaryocytic cell lines (Dami and MEG-01). Normal epithelial breast cells (MCF-10A and HBL-100) and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells were negative fo"
https://openalex.org/W2035243399,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) has both metabolic and mitogenic activities mediated through interaction with the type 1 IGF receptor. The circulation of IGF-I in blood and interstitial fluid is not but bound mostly to a family of six high affinity IGF-binding proteins, which form stable complexes with IGF and neutralize its bioactivity. Therefore, displacement of this large pool of endogenous IGF from the binding proteins could elevate free IGF levels to elicit beneficial effects in diabetes and other IGF-responsive diseases comparable with those produced by administration of exogenous IGF-I. We report here the identification of a nonpeptide ligand NBI-31772, which displaces IGF-I from all six IGF-binding proteins at low nanomolar concentrations from screening of the in-house chemical libraries. Furthermore, the released IGF-I was shown to be biologically active in an in vitro bioassay. Thus, NBI-31772 could serve as a valuable lead molecule for the design of novel therapeutics to treat diabetes and other IGF-responsive diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2068642950,"Fps1p is a glycerol efflux channel from<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. In this atypical major intrinsic protein neither of the signature NPA motifs of the family, which are part of the pore, is preserved. To understand the functional consequences of this feature, we analyzed the pseudo-NPA motifs of Fps1p by site-directed mutagenesis and assayed the resultant mutant proteins <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, we took advantage of the fact that the closest bacterial homolog of Fps1p, <i>Escherichia coli</i> GlpF, can be functionally expressed in yeast, thus enabling the analysis in yeast cells of mutations that make this typical major intrinsic protein more similar to Fps1p. We observed that mutations made in Fps1p to ""restore"" the signature NPA motifs did not substantially affect channel function. In contrast, when GlpF was mutated to resemble Fps1p, all mutants had reduced activity compared with wild type. We rationalized these data by constructing models of one GlpF mutant and of the transmembrane core of Fps1p. Our model predicts that the pore of Fps1p is more flexible than that of GlpF. We discuss the fact that this may accommodate the divergent NPA motifs of Fps1p and that the different pore structures of Fps1p and GlpF may reflect the physiological roles of the two glycerol facilitators."
https://openalex.org/W2052016234,"CAATCH1 (cation-amino acidtransporter/channel) is a recently cloned insect epithelial membrane protein related to mammalian Na+-, Cl−-coupled neurotransmitter transporters (Feldman, D. H., Harvey, W. R., and Stevens, B. R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 24518–24526). In the present study we analyze the relationship between CAATCH1-mediated amino acid transport and ion fluxes by utilizing theXenopus oocyte expression system in conjunction with electrophysiology and radiotracer uptake. Simultaneous flux measurements reveal that electrical currents and amino acid transport are thermodynamically uncoupled. This observation is supported by measuring significant uptake even in the absence of external alkali cations. Remarkably, CAATCH1-associated Na+ or K+ currents are large and do not saturate with voltage nor with cation concentration. These currents reverse in Nernstian fashion, thereby conferring channel activity in CAATCH1. Upon step-changes in the membrane potential, CAATCH1-expressing oocytes exhibit transient currents. Detailed analyses of these transients in the absence and presence of amino acids reveal direct ligand-protein interaction, demonstrating that binding by different amino acids (e.g.proline, threonine, methionine) differentially affects the state probability of CAATCH1 but has no effect on the maximal charge movement (Qmax). Together these data suggest that CAATCH1 is a multifunction membrane protein that mediates thermodynamically uncoupled amino acid uptake but functions predominantly as an amino acid-gated alkali cation channel. CAATCH1 (cation-amino acidtransporter/channel) is a recently cloned insect epithelial membrane protein related to mammalian Na+-, Cl−-coupled neurotransmitter transporters (Feldman, D. H., Harvey, W. R., and Stevens, B. R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 24518–24526). In the present study we analyze the relationship between CAATCH1-mediated amino acid transport and ion fluxes by utilizing theXenopus oocyte expression system in conjunction with electrophysiology and radiotracer uptake. Simultaneous flux measurements reveal that electrical currents and amino acid transport are thermodynamically uncoupled. This observation is supported by measuring significant uptake even in the absence of external alkali cations.

Harvey W.R. Stevens B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24518-24526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although CAATCH1 was isolated from a larval nutrient absorptive epithelium, its sequence and electrophysiological properties are similar to mammalian Na+-, Cl−-coupled cotransporters (2Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) whose members utilize electrochemical Na+ gradients to drive the re-uptake of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (3Sonders M.S.

Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), glutamate (5Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), and γ-aminobutyric acid (6Loo D.D.F. Eskandari S. Boorer K.J. Sarkar H.K. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37414-37422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The greatest sequence identity (90%) is found with the M. sexta K+-coupled amino acid transporter KAAT1 (7Castagna M. Shayakul C. Trotti D. Sacchi V.F. Harvey W.R. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5395-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Like KAAT1, CAATCH1 mediates amino acid uptake, and exhibits both an amino acid-elicited current and an alkali cation current in the absence of amino acids (1Feldman D.H. Harvey W.R. Stevens B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24518-24526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the two proteins differ markedly in their amino acid substrate specificity and electrophysiological profiles. Notably, the CAATCH1 Na+ current is inhibited by specific amino acids, reminiscent of the ligand (e.g.cocaine)-modulated current in the human dopamine transporter (3Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led us previously to suggest that CAATCH1 may be involved in the regulation of Na+fluxes in the larvae and thus may play a broader role than that of a “classical” cation-coupled nutrient amino acid cotransporter (1Feldman D.H. Harvey W.R. Stevens B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24518-24526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The goal of this work, therefore, was to study the relationship between the transport of representative amino acids (l-proline,l-threonine, and l-methionine) (1Feldman D.H. Harvey W.R. Stevens B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24518-24526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and fluxes of cations (Na+ and K+). To this end we have analyzed CAATCH1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes by using tracer flux and the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Remarkably, amino acid uptake by CAATCH1 is thermodynamically uncoupled from ion fluxes. However, the most intriguing finding of the present report is that CAATCH1 functions predominantly as an amino acid-modulated alkali cation channel. CAATCH1 was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and analyzed using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method, as described previously (1Feldman D.H. Harvey W.R. Stevens B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24518-24526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Quick M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1728-1734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For transport and electrophysiological experiments, oocytes were bathed in an assay buffer composed of 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm TAPS-NMG+, pH 8.0, and a combination of Na+ or K+ chloride salts with NMG+to give a final concentration of 100 mm. Uptake of 500 μm of 3H-labeled l-amino acids (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed in non-clamped oocytes or was monitored under voltage clamp for 20 min (8Quick M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1728-1734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Amino acid-evoked currents were obtained as the difference between currents in the presence and absence of amino acid. For evaluation of transient currents, total currents were fitted to the following, Itotal(t)=ICe(−t/τ1)+ITe(−t/τ2)+ISSEquation 1 where Itotal is the total current,IC, IT, andISS are membrane capacitive current, transient current, and steady-state current, respectively, withτ1 as the time constant ofIC, and τ2 as the time constant of IT. Charge-voltage (Q–V) relations for each membrane voltage (Vm) were obtained by integrating transient currents (after subtracting the capacitive and the steady-state currents from the total currents) with time and were fitted to the following equation (9Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar),Q−QhypQmax=11+exp[z(Vm−V0.5)F/RT]Equation 2 with Qhyp and Qdepfor Q at hyperpolarizing and depolarizing limits, respectively. V0.5 represents the membrane potential at which 50% of the total charge has moved in the membrane electric field, z is the apparent valence of the moveable charge, and F, R, and T have their usual meanings. Data were fitted using non-linear regression algorithms of SigmaPlot (version 6.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Unless noted otherwise, figures are representative experiments on single oocytes, and errors represent S.E. of the fit. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate with oocytes from different donor frogs. Steady-state current responses to a series of 100-ms voltage steps (−150 mV to +50 mV from a holding potential of −50 mV) were measured at [Na+]ex or [K+]ex varying from 0 to 100 mm. Fig. 1 A shows representative current-voltage (I–V) relationships for a CAATCH1-expressing oocyte or an non-injected control oocyte in the absence of external amino acid. For CAATCH1-expressing oocytes the current magnitude increased with increasing [cation]ex1 at negative potentials, but was much less affected at potentials more positive than +10 mV. Each of the currents reversed but did not become saturated at either the highest cation concentration nor the largest hyperpolarizing voltage (−150 mV). Although currents in the absence of external Na+ or K+ (i.e. in the presence of NMG100+) were similar for CAATCH1-expressing oocytes and control oocytes at −150 mV (∼−75 nA), the outward currents for CAATCH1-expressing oocytes greatly exceeded those observed in control oocytes. The reversal potential of currents in NMG100+ was −95 mV for CAATCH1-expressing oocytes and −35 mV for control oocytes. Increasing [Na+]ex to 100 mm had no significant effect on the current magnitude or the reversal potential in control oocytes. However, raising [K+]exto 100 mm increased the current magnitude in control oocytes at potentials more negative than −10 mV (−260 nA at −150 mV) and shifted the reversal potential toward more positive potentials (−15 mV at K100+). On the other hand, for CAATCH1-expressing oocytes the reversal potential of the currents was shifted by 58 ± 2 mV and 59 ± 2 mV per 10-fold change in external Na+ and K+ concentration, respectively (Fig. 1 B). To obtain the net cation-induced currents, the currents observed in NMG100+ were subtracted from those in the presence of various concentrations of [Na+]ex and [K+]ex. The resulting currents were slightly decreased in their magnitude at hyperpolarizing potentials. However, the outward rectification at depolarizing potentials observed only for CAATCH1-injected oocytes, which is due to K+ outward conductance, was eliminated by this method, and thus the currents became saturated with depolarization (data not shown). Addition of 0.5 mml-proline,l-threonine, or l-methionine to various concentrations of [Na+]ex and [K+]ex had different effects on the current magnitude depending on the type of amino acid, and the cation species and concentration. Fig. 2 Ashows representative amino acid-evoked currents in 100 mm[Na+]ex and [K+]exafter subtracting the currents in the absence of amino acid from the total currents in presence of 0.5 mm amino acid. In K100+ the amino acid-evoked currents with l-threonine, l-proline, andl-methionine increased with hyperpolarization and were comparable (∼−1 to −1.8 μA at −150 mV). Increasing [K+]ex from 1 to 100 mm increased the amino acid-elicited inward currents, but these currents did not become saturated at either the most hyperpolarizing potential nor with the highest external [K+] (data not shown). In Na100+ 0.5 mml-proline elicited the largest amino acid-induced inward current, which did not become saturated with hyperpolarization (−2.3 μA at −150 mV) whereas the l-threonine-evoked current was much smaller (−0.5 μA at −150 mV). Addition of 0.5 mml-methionine in Na100+ inhibited the magnitude of the total current, which was reflected as anl-methionine-elicited outward current at hyperpolarizing voltages (Fig. 2, A and B) (1Feldman D.H. Harvey W.R. Stevens B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24518-24526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At [Na+]ex > 5 mml-methionine inhibited the current, and the magnitude of the inhibition increased by increasing [Na+]ex. However, at [Na+]ex ≤ 5 mm addition ofl-methionine increased the inward currents at negative potentials (Fig. 2 B). Similar to l-methionine, addition of 0.5 mml-threonine to [Na+]ex from 1 to 10 mm generated inward currents that increased with hyperpolarization. At [Na+]ex ≥ 25 mm the magnitude of the inward currents at −150 mV decreased, but the inhibition became more distinct between −10 and −130 mV, yielding complex (convex shaped) I–V relations. In the absence of external alkali cation (NMG100+), addition of either amino acid to the bathing solution generated only marginal voltage-independent amino acid-evoked inward currents of about 10 nA (data not shown). No amino acid-elicited currents were detectable in control oocytes by varying [Na+]ex and [K+]ex from 1 to 100 mm (data not shown). Next, we assayed 500 μm3H-labeled l-proline, l-threonine, and l-methionine uptakes under non-clamped conditions in oocytes expressing CAATCH1 and in control oocytes (Fig.3 A). In the same batch of oocytes used for these uptake studies, CAATCH1-expressing oocytes exhibited a membrane potential of −31 ± 5 mV (n= 5), and for non-injected oocytes −36 ± 2 mV (n= 3). The greatest uptake rate was observed with l-proline in Na100+. However, unlikel-proline, which increased the magnitude of the inward currents, significant uptake was observed for l-threonine and l-methionine, even though these amino acids inhibited (l-methionine) or slightly increased (l-threonine) the currents at a comparable test potential under voltage-clamped conditions (−30 mV, see Fig. 2, A andB). Uptake in K100+ was less than in Na100+ but was similar among all three amino acids. In the absence of external cations (NMG100+, Fig. 3 A,inset) or 1 mm [Na+]ex(data not shown), oocytes expressing CAATCH1 exhibited about 80%l-methionine uptake compared with Na100+. The background uptake activity in control oocytes was similar among all three amino acids (about 25 pmol of amino acid × oocyte−1 × 20 min−1). To provide direct comparison between amino acid flux and electrical currents in the same oocyte, uptake was also performed under voltage-clamped conditions. Addition of 500 μm3H-labeled l-proline, l-threonine, or l-methionine to K100+bathing solution reversibly increased the inward current (l-methionine is shown in Fig. 3 B). Integration of the inward current with time revealed the net amino acid-evoked charge movement. In the same oocyte the 3H content was also determined. Fig. 3 C shows the molar ratio of amino acid uptake to charge movement as function of [3H]amino acid uptake for each [cation]100/amino acid combination. In K100+ the molar ratios of inward movement of positive charges and l-proline,l-threonine, and l-methionine uptake varied from 0.6 to 2.4 among individual oocytes, a variation greatly exceeding the experimental error observed in similar experiments for cotransport proteins (6Loo D.D.F.

Wright E.M. Hirayama B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 49: F278-F282Crossref Google Scholar). A similar observation was also made forl-proline in Na100+ (charge movement: flux ratio from 0.7 to 2.5). In Na100+, addition ofl-methionine inhibited the current and required long washout periods (Fig. 3 B). Although addition ofl-threonine either increased or inhibited the current in individual oocytes, data shown in Fig. 3 C represent oocytes for which addition of l-threonine inhibited the current. Integrating these currents with time revealed that uptake ofl-methionine or l-threonine is accompanied by an apparent net outward movement of positive charges (alternatively, for l-threonine the direction of the current is variable) giving non-fixed molar ratios. In contrast to studies under non-clamped conditions, however, amino acid uptake at a holding potential of −90 mV greatly varied among individual oocytes from the same batch and among oocytes from different batches. This great variation was also observed in experiments at different voltages (−110, −60, and −10 mV; data not shown), thus precluding us from a more detailed analysis of the voltage dependence of amino acid uptake. In non-injected oocytes amino acid-dependent charge movement was not detectable and uptake did not exceed 25% of the CAATCH1-expressing oocytes (Fig. 3 B). In Na+, step-changes in the membrane potential induced transient currents in CAATCH1-expressing oocytes (Fig.4 A) but not in non-injected oocytes (Fig. 4 C), thus reflecting CAATCH1-associated charge transfer in the membrane dielectric field. Fig. 4 A(upper panel) shows current responses in the absence of amino acid in 25 mm [Na+]ex. For each voltage pulse, currents in the ON and OFF response were fitted to Equation 1. After a fast capacitive component with a time constantτ ∼ 1 ms, which was independent of the membrane potential, each current relaxed to a steady state with a single time constant. The time constants in the ON and OFF response were voltage-dependent and exhibited a Gaussian distribution with maximum τON =τOFF ∼ 5.9 ms at about −27 mV (data not shown). Subtracting the capacitive and steady-state component yielded the CAATCH1-associated transient currents. These transients were equal and opposite in sign in the ON and OFF response (the ON response is shown in Fig. 4 B, upper panel). To obtain the charge transfer, the current transients were integrated with time for each voltage and plotted as a function of the membrane potential. The data were described by the Boltzmann equation (see Equation 2) withQmax = 20 nC ± 0.5,V0.5 = −47 ± 1 mV, and z= 1 ± 0.03 (Fig. 4, D and E). Addition of 0.5 mml-threonine (Fig. 4 A,lower panel; or l-methionine, data not shown) dramatically affected the current transients shiftingV0.5 to −0.5 ± 2 mV, but with no effect on Qmax (21 nC ± 2) or z(1 ± 0.02). Although the relaxation time constants at potentials ≤ −70 mV were indistinguishable from the capacitive time constants, the greatest relaxation time constant (τON = τOFF ∼ 14 ms) was detected at +50 mV. At 25 mm[Na+]ex addition of l-proline had only a minor effect on the transient currents. However, increasing [Na+]ex ≥ 50 mm slightly shiftedV0.5 toward more positive potentials (Fig.4 E). In K+, the relaxation currents observed for CAATCH1-expressing oocytes were much smaller than those in Na+ (data not shown). Because the magnitude and the relaxation time constants of these transitions were similar to those observed in non-injected oocytes (Fig. 4 C), we were unable to obtain reliable transient current kinetics for K+. Fig. 4 D shows a plot of the charge (Q) as a function of voltage for [Na+]ex from 5 to 100 mm in the absence of amino acid. Increasing [Na+]ex shifted the Q–V curves to more positive potentials, accompanied by a positive shift ofV0.5 (see Fig. 4 E). From 10 to 75 mm [Na+]ex the value ofQmax was 20 ± 2 nC. At the extreme [Na+]ex (<10 or >75 mm) theQ–V curves did not become saturated at hyperpolarizing or depolarizing potentials, thereby precluding accurate Boltzmann fits outside this range. For all test [Na+]ex,z ∼ 1. Increasing [Na+]ex from 10 to 100 mm shifted V0.5 from −68 ± 1 mV to −5 ± 4 mV (Fig. 4 E). This shift exhibited a slope of 58 ± 3.5 mV per 10-fold change in [Na+]ex in the absence of amino acids. Addition of 0.5 mml-proline shiftedV0.5 at [Na+]ex ≥ 50 mm slightly toward depolarizing potentials. A more dramatic shift of V0.5 toward positive potentials was observed by the addition of 0.5 mml-threonine and to a greater extent with l-methionine at [Na+]ex ≥ 5 mm. It is noteworthy that the shift of V0.5 to depolarizing potentials limited adequate Boltzmann equation fitting in these cases. In the absence of external Na+ or presence of 1 mm [Na+]ex no significant effect on V0.5 was observed. Fig. 5 A shows the positive shift of the Q–V curve along the voltage axis induced by the addition of 2 mm [l-methionine] in 10 mm [Na+]ex. This shift was not accompanied by changes in either Qmax orz. The methionine-induced V0.5 shift (ΔV0.5) saturated with [l-methionine] with a half-maximal concentration (K0.5) of 173 ± 5 μm (Fig.5 B) (13Loo D.D.F. Hirayama B.A. Gallardo E.M. Lam J. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained withl-threonine in 25 mm[Na+]ex (K0.5 = 138 ± 6 μm). At lower [Na+]ex (5 mm forl-methionine, or 10 mm for threonine) addition of [amino acid] < 100 μm shiftedV0.5 toward hyperpolarizing potentials. No shift of V0.5 was observed at [amino acid] = 100 μm, but above this [amino acid]V0.5 was shifted toward positive potentials. In the present study we exploit the Xenopus oocyte expression system in conjunction with electrophysiological and flux measurements to analyze the relationship between CAATCH1-associated amino acid transport and electrical currents. CAATCH1 mediates amino acid uptake uncoupled from electrical ion currents, yet it predominantly behaves as an amino acid-modulated alkali cation channel. These conclusions are based on several lines of evidence. Amino acid uptake and amino acid-elicited electrical currents atVm ∼ −30 mV (see Figs. 2 B and3 A) indicate that amino acid transport is not accompanied by stoichiometrically fixed charge movement, even though the highest uptake activity and amino acid-elicited currents were observed forl-proline in the presence of Na+. Strikingly, although l-methionine is transported, it inhibits the magnitude of the currents. This directly contradicts the accepted prerequisites for thermodynamically coupled cotransport (10Mackenzie B. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Gerencser G.A. Stevens B.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 59-75PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, l-methionine flux is also observed in the absence of external alkali cations. In the absence of external Na+or K+ only marginal inward currents are evoked after addition of either amino acid, and thus these results indicate that (i) CAATCH1-mediated amino acid transport is not necessarily accompanied by ion movement (similar observations are also reported for amino acid uniport in Bombyx mori larval midgut (15Leonardi M.G. Casartelli M. Parenti P. Giordana B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 1372-1375Crossref Google Scholar)); and (ii) Na+ and K+ represent the charge-carrying ions through CAATCH1. The latter conclusion is also in line with the high sequence similarity between CAATCH1 and other membrane proteins that are permeable to Na+ and K+ (5Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 16Bossi E. Sacchi V.F. Peres A. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 438: 788-796Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Bossi E. Centinaio E. Castagna M. Giovannardi S. Vincenti S. Sacchi V.F. Peres A. J. Physiol. 2000; 515: 729-742Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, it is unlikely that the generation of an endogenous non-selective cation channel (18Vandorpe D.H. Chernova M.N. Jiang L. Sellin L.K. Wilhelm S. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Walz G. Alper S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4093-4101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) is induced by the expression of CAATCH1 in oocytes. This is because equimolar replacement of NMG+ with 50 mm Ca2+, or lanthanoids (La3+, Er3+, or Eu3+) [chloride salts] did not significantly modify the currents compared with those observed in NMG100+ (data not shown). To provide a direct comparison of amino acid flux and charge movement over the same time course in the same oocyte and to eliminate limitations due to cell-to-cell variability in protein expression, we analyzed tracer uptake under voltage-clamped conditions. In line with the above conclusions, CAATCH1-mediated amino acid/charge flux ratios vary considerably among individual oocytes and between amino acids in Na+ or K+, thus arguing against stoichiometrically fixed cation-coupled amino acid transport as predicted by the determination of the Hill coefficients by cation activation kinetics (1Feldman D.H. Harvey W.R. Stevens B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24518-24526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, this kinetic parameter represents a qualitative indicator of the apparent binding cooperativity (11Forster I.C. Loo D.D.F. Eskandari S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F644-F649PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gerencser G.A. Stevens B.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 59-75PubMed Google Scholar,19Forsén S. Linse S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 495-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Weiss J.N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Unlike direct amino acid and ion flux measurements in the same oocyte, the Hill activation coefficient cannot be regarded as a true measure of the coupling stoichiometry (14Gerencser G.A. Stevens B.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 59-75PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, in a coupled system, Na+- and K+-driven amino acid cotransport would have a similar coupling mechanism, i.e.the energy stored in the electrochemical concentration gradient of either coupling cation would be transduced into transport work, as recently shown for Na+- and H+-coupled glucose symport by hSGLT1 (8Quick M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1728-1734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present data reveal that the electrogenic properties of CAATCH1 mirror the effect of amino acid on the thermodynamically uncoupled electrical current similar to the effect of pharmacological ligands (e.g. cocaine, dopamine) on the human dopamine transporter-associated currents (3Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the ligand-gated ion channel conductance reported for theDrosophila serotonin transporter (21Galli A. Petersen C.I. deBlaquiere M. Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3401-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.6). However, the CAATCH1-associated currents are much greater in magnitude than those observed for these transporters. The present report emphasizes that CAATCH1-associated electrical currents reflect a channel conductance for alkali cations. This conclusion is based on the fact that CAATCH1 exhibits large Na+ and K+ (and Li+ (1Feldman D.H. Harvey W.R. Stevens B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24518-24526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) currents (Fig. 1 A). These currents are dependent on both cation concentration and membrane voltage but do not become saturated by either condition. Most importantly, these currents reverse according to the Nernst-Planck relation (Fig. 1 B). Substrate-independent leakage currents have been described previously for several transport proteins (8Quick M. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

Upon step-changes of the membrane potential, CAATCH1 exhibits transient currents. These transients result from the distribution of charges due to movement of polar residues and/or the movement of the permeating cations within the transmembrane electrical field. CAATCH1 transient and steady-state currents are intimately associated, thus reflecting the correlation between conductance and state probability of the channel. This conclusion is supported by the following observations: (i) transient currents in Na+ are only observed in oocytes expressing CAATCH1; (ii) charge transfer (Q) becomes saturated with either hyperpolarization or depolarization and is (iii) equal and opposite in sign in the ON and OFF responses, the latter of which is also valid for (iv) the relaxation time constants; (v) the maximal charge transfer (Qmax) is independent of [Na+]ex from 10 to 75 mm; (vi)V0.5 is a function of [Na+]ex and gives a 58 ± 3.5 mV shift per 10-fold change in [Na+]ex, indicating binding of a single Na+ as predicted from steady-state current analysis (Hill coefficient = 1); and (vii)V0.5 but not Qmax norz is affected by amino acids. The latter observation is most apparent for amino acids that inhibit the steady-state currents, strongly suggesting that direct interaction of the amino acid with CAATCH1 affects the state probability. Even though proline, threonine, and methionine are each indeed transported, they do not participate in a cation-coupled cotransport mechanism. Unlike cotransported substrates in a “prototypical” cotransporter (e.g. glucose via SGLT1) (6Loo D.D.F. Eskandari S. Boorer K.J. Sarkar H.K. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), these amino acids do not affect the maximal charge (Qmax) in CAATCH1. Detailed analyses of the effect of amino acids on theV0.5 shift show saturation kinetics, reflecting high affinity amino acid binding at specific [Na+]ex (Fig. 5). Because the direction of the V0.5 shift strongly depends on both [Na+]ex and [amino acid], these data imply that the state probability depends not only on the ligand concentration but also on the concentration and species of the cation. Although amino acid and ion fluxes are thermodynamically uncoupled, these results indicate that the two functions of CAATCH1 affect each other by an as yet unknown mechanism (Fig. 6). However, CAATCH1-associated current transitions are reliably observed only in presence of Na+, but not in K+. This may reflect experimental limitations due to the intact oocyte system, notably the trans substrate composition (i.e. K+, and amino acids) (25Guidotti G.G. Gazzola G.C. Kilberg M.S. Häussinger D. Mammalian Amino Acid Transport: Mechanisms and Control. Plenum Press, New York1992: 3-29Crossref Google Scholar, 26Taylor P.M. Kaur S. Mackenzie B. Peter G.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 923-931PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason the observed uptake activity may not reflect net amino acid flux but instead may be the result of a complex transport mechanism, e.g. homo- or hetero-exchange, similar to that reported for ASCT-1 (27Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27991-27994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), ASCT-2 (28Bröer A. Brookes N. Ganapathy V. Dimmer K.S. Wagner C.A. Lang F.

Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although no transient currents were detectable in control oocytes in Na+ (which permits a thorough analysis of CAATCH1 relaxation transients), the CAATCH1-associated transient currents in K+ may be “hidden” by the current relaxations observed in control oocytes in K+ (Fig.4 C). Alternatively, as observed for the transients in the presence of l-threonine, which were indistinguishable from the capacitive relaxations at hyperpolarizing potentials, the charge distribution in presence of K+ may simply be too fast to be resolved (<1 ms). It is shown for KAAT1 that K+-dependent charge transfer is only detectable at high hyperpolarizing potentials using a different pulse protocol (16Bossi E. Sacchi V.F. Peres A. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 438: 788-796Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Bossi E. Centinaio E. Castagna M. Giovannardi S. Vincenti S. Sacchi V.F. Peres A. J.

However, the instability of CAATCH1-expressing oocytes at potentials more negative than −150 mV precluded us from applying a similar method. To overcome these problems and gain precise control of the experimental conditions, the application of refined methods such as the cut-open oocyte technique (32Taglialatela M. Toro L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) would help to further analyze CAATCH1 in more detail. Taken together, the data of the present report emphasize that CAATCH1, upon expression in Xenopus oocytes, represents a dual function protein that mediates amino acid transport but predominantly functions as an amino acid-gated alkali cation channel. Based on these findings CAATCH1 may be a new prototype of non-selective, highly regulated alkali cation translocation systems. Inasmuch as Na+ is essential for cell functions in other tissues of insects (33Treherne J.E. Nature. 1962; 193: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 34Monticelli G. Giordana B.

Unlike other cellular organelles, their function may be highly diverse, dependent on cell type and the external stimuli the cell encounters. In plants they are involved in photorespiration, in trypanosomes they are involved in glycolysis, and in fungi they are involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, such as β-lactam penicillins (1Olsen L.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 163-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hannaert V. Michels P.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3van de Kamp M.

In yeast they are essential for the metabolism of unusual carbon sources such as oleic acid, primary amines, purines,d-amino acids, and methanol (4van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 502-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In humans they are involved in a variety of anabolic and catabolic pathways, including plasmalogen and cholesterol biosynthesis as well as fatty acid and purine degradation. Peroxisome malfunctioning is the cause of severe inherited human disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome (5van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B. Wanders R.J. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 6Gould S.J. Valle D. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes do not contain DNA or a protein-synthesizing machinery. Consequently, peroxisomal proteins are synthesized on cytosolic polysomes and sorted post-translationally to their target organelle (7Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Two distinct signal sequences for peroxisomal matrix proteins have been defined (designated as PTSs)1, the C-terminal PTS1, SKL, and variants and the N-terminal PTS2 (8Subramani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32483-32486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In general, import of peroxisomal proteins does not involve any significant protein modification (9Titorenko V.I. Smith J.J. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recently, several genes involved in peroxisome biogenesis, so-called PEX genes encoding peroxins, have been cloned by the functional complementation of yeast mutant strains lacking functional peroxisomes (10Hettema E.H. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Up to now, 23 PEX genes have been described, and more are likely to be identified in the near future. Data base screening has been shown to be a powerful tool to identify human homologues of the yeast peroxins. Thirteen human PEX homologues have been identified, so far of which 11 were shown to restore peroxisome biogenesis in cell lines of patients with peroxisomal disorders (6Gould S.J. Valle D. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Most peroxins (18 out of 23) are membrane-associated proteins, either peripheral or integral. To study the specific functions of theseperoxisomal membrane (PM)-bound peroxins, information about the topology of these proteins is required. In particular, the location of functional domains, either catalytic or domains involved in physical interactions with other proteins, needs to be established to get insight into the roles of the PM peroxins. Biochemical techniques to discriminate between peripheralversus integral membrane protein (differential extraction by low salt, high salt, and sodium carbonate) and to determine the topology of PM peroxins (protease protection assays on purified organelles or differential permeabilization of cellular membranes) have been performed on most of the PM peroxins reported. In many cases, however, these procedures have not led to unequivocal information on the topology of these PM peroxins. Typical examples of this include the analyses on Pex8p (11Waterham H.R.

Therefore, we set out to develop an alternative method to establish the topology of PM peroxins. The basic idea was to introduce a specific, heterologous protease in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha. Prerequisite is that the protease should be active on a defined amino acid sequence not present in essential proteins of the yeast, which can be introduced in substrate PM peroxins. Co-expression of a PM peroxin containing a protease-processing site with a cytosolic protease in one strain or a peroxisomal protease in another strain should reveal whether the processing site is accessible in the cytosol or in the peroxisomal matrix. The major advantage of such a system would be that no other proteins need to be analyzed to determine the accessibility of the peroxisomal matrix as it is the strain expressing the cytosolic variant of the protease that is the control for the strain expressing the peroxisomal variant and vice versa. We selected a 239-amino acid fragment of the 346-kDa tobacco etch virus (TEV) polyprotein containing a proteinase activity specifically processing the consensus sequence (heptapeptide) EXXYXQ(S/G) in cis and intrans (33Dougherty W.G.

This protease has been used for site-specific proteolysis bothin vitro and in vivo in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae of substrate proteins containing the consensus sequence for processing (34Smith T.A.

TheHindIII site upstream and the SalI site downstream the hybrid genes (TEVp derivatives and TEVp substrate molecules) were used for insertion into pHIPX4 and pHIPZ4. For insertion of TEVp-derivatives into pHIPZ5, BamHI andSalI digestions were used. For constructing thePEX10.tev.GFP hybrid gene, a XhoI site was introduced downstream C-terminal codon R295 of H. polymorpha PEX10 by PCR and primer KN20 and fused to theXhoI site preceding tev-GFP. Similarly, using PCR and primer KN15, a SalI site was introduced downstream C-terminal codon A457 of H. polymorpha PEX3 and fused to theXhoI site preceding tev-GFP to construct thePex3.tev.GFP hybrid gene. The PEX3.tev.GFP andPEX10.tev.GFP hybrid genes were inserted asBamHI-SalI fragments into pHIPX4.Table IIPrimers and plasmids used in this studyPrimersDNA sequence (5′-3′)KN3CCCAAGCTTATGGAGCAGAAGTTGATTTCTGAGGAAGACCTCGAGTCTTCTACAGAAAAGCGGCKN11CCCAAGCTTGGATCCATGTCCTTGTTTAAGGGACCACGKN12GGGGTCGACTTACGAGTACACCAATTCATTCKN13GGGGTCGACTTACAGCTTCGAGTACACGAGCTCATTCATGAGKN14CCCCTCGAGAACCTGTACTTCCAGTCGAGATCTGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCKN15AACCGACTGGAAGTACAGGTTCTCGTCGACAGCATCGAAATTAGAGTAGKN20GGGCTCGAGAGATCTTAGAGGCAACAGCTGCGPlasmidsRelevant characteristicspHIPX4aPlasmids reported in Refs. 61and 45, respectively.KanR,ScLEU2, PAOX-driven expressionpHIPZ4aPlasmids reported in Refs. 61and 45, respectively.AmpR, ZeoR, PAOX-driven expressionpHIPZ5bAll other plasmids first reported in this study.AmpR, ZeoR, PAMO-driven expressionpFEM45pHIPZ4-TEVpFEM46pHIPZ4-TEV.SKLpFEM68pHIPZ5-TEVpFEM69pHIPZ5-TEV.SKLpFEM72pHIPX4-Nmyc.tev.GFPpFEM74pHIPX4-Nmyc.tev.GFP.SKLpFEM152pHIPX4-PEX3.tev.GFPpFEM147pHIPX4-PEX10.tev.GFPa Plasmids reported in Refs. 61Gietl C.

Polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits using the 27-kDa fragment of the TEV protease used in this study. The antibodies against GFP were a gift from Dr. W.-H. Kunau, Bochum, Germany. Goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase and goat anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used as secondary antibodies that were detected by bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Fluorescent microscopy to localize hybrid proteins containing GFP was performed as described (46Baerends R.J.S. Faber K.N. Kram A.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol.

Whole cells were fixed and prepared for electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry as described previously (11Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling was performed on ultrathin sections of unicryl-embedded cells using specific antibodies against various H. polymorpha proteins and GFP and gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (GAR-gold) antibodies according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The use of the TEV protease to study the principles of peroxisome biogenesis in H. polymorpha is critically dependent on the following prerequisites. 1) The protein should be synthesized and become active in this yeast without loss of cell viability, 2) it should be active on substrate proteins in the cytosol as well as in peroxisomes, and 3) the activity of cytosolic and peroxisomal TEVp should be selective toward cytosolic and peroxisomal substrate molecules. The experiments to analyze these prerequisites are detailed below. To establish the activity and subcellular localization of TEVp and TEVp.SKL in H. polymorpha in vivo, we constructed two hybrid genes encoding either a cytosolic or a peroxisomal tev-containing substrate protein molecule (Fig.1A). These proteins consist of an N-terminal Myc sequence (MEQKLISEEDL) followed by the TEV proteolytic consensus sequence (ENLYFQ↓S, abbreviated as tev in text and figures) and the reporter protein eGFP (Nmyc.tev.GFP, cytosolic protein). In the case of the peroxisomal substrate, a PTS1 sequence, SKL, is added at the C terminus (Nmyc.tev.GFP.SKL). Synthesis of the TEVp substrate molecules was controlled by the strong methanol-regulated alcohol oxidase promoter (PAOX). The production of the hybrid proteins was determined by Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against GFP or the Myc epitope. Both antisera specifically recognized a protein band of the expected size of ∼30 kDa in crude extracts prepared from methanol-grown transformants (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 2). These protein bands were undetectable in extracts prepared from the control host strain (data not shown). The subcellular localization of the TEVp-substrate proteins was determined by fluorescence microscopy and immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 1, a diffuse fluorescence was observed in cells of the strain synthesizing Nmyc.tev.GFP (Fig.1B), which is indicative of a cytosolic location of the protein. Immunolabeling experiments using antibodies against the Myc epitope confirmed that indeed this substrate molecule had accumulated in the cytosol (Fig. 1D). Also, significant labeling was localized on the nucleus of these cells, which is however not unexpected since this substrate molecule has a size that should allow free passage through the nuclear pore (49Talcott B. Moore M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 50Shulga N. Mosammaparast N. Wozniak R. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, fluorescence was observed as bright dots in the strain producing Nmyc.tev.GFP.SKL (Fig. 1C). The peroxisomal localization of this protein was corroborated by immunocytochemical experiments (Fig.1E) in which Myc antibody-dependent labeling was exclusively located on these organelles. Unexpectedly, the protein did not diffuse into the crystalline AO matrix of the organelle as for instance observed for the endogenous enzyme dihydroxyacetone synthase (51Keizer I. Roggenkamp R. Harder W. Veenhuis M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 72: 7-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, it accumulated in the narrow space in between the crystalline matrix and the peroxisomal membrane (Fig. 1E), a location also observed for endogenous catalase protein (51Keizer I. Roggenkamp R. Harder W. Veenhuis M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 72: 7-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2In vivo processing of the cytosolic and peroxisomal TEVp-substrate proteins.

To this end, the active 27-kDa domain of the TEV protease (52Dougherty W.G. Parks T.D. Virology. 1991; 183: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was modified by introducing an initiation codon (ATG/Met) in front of amino acid 2040 and a termination codon (TAA) downstream amino acid 2278 of full-length TEV. For peroxisomal targeting, the typical C-terminal PTS1 signal, SKL, was introduced at the extreme C terminus (TEVp.SKL). In initial experiments, expression of the TEVp variants was controlled by the PAOX. Four strains were constructed in which the TEVp substrate proteins were co-synthesized with either TEVp or TEVp.SKL. Since the TEV protease might act on any endogenous protein containing the consensus sequence EXXYXQ↓(S/G), we first determined whether the TEV protease affected cell viability. As shown in Fig. 2, lanes 3-6, synthesis of the TEV protease destined for the cytosol or peroxisomes was readily demonstrated in cells grown for 16 h in methanol-containing medium. All four strains were viable and showed growth characteristics in methanol-containing medium akin to the host strain. Electron microscopical analysis did not reveal any significant morphological difference between cells producing either TEVp or TEVp.SKL as compared with wild type controls (data not shown). To determine whether the TEV protease is active inH. polymorpha in vivo, cell-free extracts of the four strains described above were analyzed for processing of the TEVp-substrate proteins (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis of these extracts probed with antibodies against GFP or the Myc epitope revealed that in all four strains, most of the substrate proteins were processed, reducing the size of and eliminating the Myc epitope from these molecules (Fig. 2, lanes 3-6). These results suggest that the TEV protease is active in H. polymorpha cells. However, processing of the substrate protein is also observed when the substrate and protease were supposed to be spatially separated. At least two possibilities may account for this phenomenon, namely (i) processing of the substrates occurs eitherin vitro during the preparation of the cell free extracts or (ii) processing occurs in vivo.

L., and Arrese, E. L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 17501–17509). To test this model, we have designed a double Cys mutant in which a disulfide bond linking helices 1 and 5 could be formed, resulting in an apolipoprotein with reduced conformational flexibility of its N- and C-terminal helices. Substitution of Thr18 and Ala147 by Cys residues provided a protein that under nonreducing conditions was fully oxidized. The far-UV CD spectra of this mutant in the reduced and oxidized states indicated that their secondary structures were identical to the structure of the wild type recombinant apoLp-III, which contains no Cys residues. Near-UV CD studies confirmed the formation of a disulfide bond and the absence of structural perturbations. The lipid binding activity of the reduced mutant, as determined by its ability to form discoidal lipoproteins, was nearly identical to that of the wild type protein. Contrarily, the disulfide form of the mutant was not able to form discoidal lipoproteins with liposomes of either dimirystoylphosphatidylcholine or dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol. It is concluded that the separation of the helices 1 and 5 constitutes one of the key steps along the complex pathway for the formation of the final apolipoprotein lipid-bound state. It is inferred that the conformational flexibility of helices 1 and 5 is a key property of apoLp-III, allowing the exposure of hydrophobic protein regions and the interaction of the hydrophobic faces of the amphipathic α-helices with the lipoprotein lipid surface.

The structure of apoLp-III is described as an elongated bundle of five amphipathic α-helices, where the nonpolar faces of the helices are oriented toward the protein core. A similar structure, but consisting of a four-helix bundle, is present in the N-terminal domain of human apoE (5Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). M. sexta and L. migratoria apoLp-III share a large number of physical-chemical properties with the apolipoproteins from humans and other vertebrates (1Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys.

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1976-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the common features of exchangeable apolipoproteins are their ability to reversibly bind to lipoprotein surfaces, their content and type of amphipathic α-helices (6Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. de Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their ability to form discoidal lipoprotein particles (8Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Sparrow J.T. Gotto Jr., A.M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Plasma Lipoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 95-127Google Scholar).The association of apolipoproteins with lipids is a complex process that involves several steps including protein conformational changes and the disruption of the structure of the phospholipid monolayer or bilayer. Because of this complexity, the elucidation of the limiting steps and energy barriers involved in the formation of lipoproteins is also a complex task. Two processes were clearly distinguished in binding of apoLp-III to a planar lipid bilayer (9Soulages J.L. Salamon Z. Wells M.A. Tollin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5650-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); the first process consisted in an adsorption of apoLp-III to the phospholipid bilayer, whereas the second process involved the insertion of the protein into the lipid bilayer and the formation of lipoprotein complexes (9Soulages J.L. Salamon Z. Wells M.A. Tollin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5650-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A recent study with disulfide mutants of apoE has shown that three binding steps involving different conformations of the protein can be distinguished along the pathway that leads to the formation of discoidal lipoproteins of apoE and DMPC (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The initial binding step(s) of the apolipoprotein to the lipid surface may be envisaged as an adsorption process involving small structural changes in the protein. On the other hand, large conformational changes may be needed to achieve the final lipid-bound state, which is thought to involve major interactions between the nonpolar faces of the amphipathic α-helices and the lipid surface (6Segrest J.P.

Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4605-4612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the conformational flexibility is expected to be particularly important for apolipoproteins that have a defined tertiary structure, such as apoA-I, apoE, and apoLp-III. The nonpolar sides of the amphipathic α-helices of these apolipoproteins are mostly buried in the protein core, unavailable for interaction with a lipid surface. A recent spectroscopic study of single Trp mutants of L. migratoriaapoLp-III in the lipid-free state showed that the helices 1 and 5 are characterized by a greater hydration and mobility than helices 2–4 (13Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17501-17509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On the basis of the conformational flexibility of helices 1 and 5 and the relevance of this property to the function of an exchangeable apolipoprotein, we suggested that the separation of the helices 1 and 5 could constitute an important step in the exposure of the hydrophobic core of the protein that is required to achieve the lipid-bound state (13Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17501-17509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the validity of this model, we have designed a double Cys mutant, which allowed us to tether the helices 1 and 5 of apoLp-III and test the role of their conformational flexibility in the lipid binding properties of the apolipoprotein. The results of this study demonstrate an essential role of the conformational flexibility of the N- and C-terminal helices in the lipid binding activity of the apoLp-III.DISCUSSIONDepending on the structure of the lipoprotein, two models are used to describe the interaction of the α-helices of exchangeable apolipoproteins with lipoprotein-lipid surfaces. For spherical lipoproteins, it has been proposed (6Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. de Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the amphipathic α-helices have an orientation parallel to the phospholipid monolayer surface. In this case, the hydrophobic faces of the helices are embedded in the phospholipid monolayer, whereas the hydrophilic faces remain at the lipid surface and strengthen the lipid-protein interaction by means of ionic interactions with the charged groups of the phospholipid. On the other hand, in discoidal lipoprotein particles, the apolipoprotein is assumed to stabilize the lipoprotein particle by interacting with the acyl chains along the periphery of the lipid bilayer disc (8Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Sparrow J.T. Gotto Jr., A.M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Plasma Lipoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 95-127Google Scholar, 12Wientzek M. Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4605-4612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Klon A.E. Sheldahl C.J. Hellinger M. De Loof H. Harvey S.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12542-12547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In any of these two possible final lipid-bound states of the apolipoprotein, a massive interaction of the helices with the lipoprotein lipid surface is thought to take place. Therefore, the achievement of the final lipid-bound state must involve a massive conformational change probably involving the displacement of entire helices to allow the exposure of the protein hydrophobic core. This conformational change is expected to occur at least in some apolipoproteins, such as apoLp-III, apoE, and apoA-I, for which most nonpolar domains of the amphipathic α-helices are buried in the protein core. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the conformational flexibility of the apolipoprotein may play a major role in the lipid-binding process. Two alternative models have been introduced to explain the mechanism of opening of the helix bundle of apoLp-III required for the interaction with the lipid. The first model was introduced by Breiter et al. (3Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesemberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), who on the basis of the crystal structure of apoLp-III and previous studies suggesting that apoLp-III could adopt two conformations at the water-air interface (23Kawooya J.K. Meredith S.C. Wells M.A. Kézdy F.J. Law J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13588-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) postulated that the five-helix bundle undergoes a lipid-triggered opening at putative hinge domains located between helices 2 and 3 and between helices 4 and 5. This opening would expose a large extent of the hydrophobic interior of the protein allowing the lipid-protein interaction required for the final lipid-bound state. However, a subsequent study with M. Sexta apoLp-III showed that cross-linking of the loops connecting helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 did not prevent the apolipoprotein molecule from interacting with DMPC and forming recombinant lipoprotein particles (24Narayanaswami V. Wang J. Kay C.M. Scraba D.G. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26855-26862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can infer that this mechanism is not taking place or that alternative mechanisms for the exposure of the hydrophobic domains can take place when the loops are tethered. We have recently introduced a second model proposing that one of the early conformational changes of apoLp-III during the lipid-binding process could involve spreading apart helices 1 and 5 (13Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17501-17509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This model was based on experimental data indicating that helices 2–4 of apoLp-III constituted a well packed domain, whereas helices 1 and 5 were more mobile and hydrated as well as on the assumption that the conformational flexibility constitutes a key property of exchangeable apolipoproteins (13Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17501-17509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To test the validity of this model, we investigated the effect of decreasing the conformational flexibility of helices 1 and 5 on the lipid binding activity of the apolipoprotein. For this purpose, we constructed a double Cys mutant that in the disulfide state tethered the centers of helices 1 and 5 of apoLp-III. The structure of this mutant as studied by circular dichroism indicated that the mutations and the formation of the disulfide bond did not introduce a major perturbation in the secondary structure of the protein. Moreover, the internal packing of the protein, as determined by the packing constraints of the single Trp residue, was not altered, indicating that the disulfide mutant in either the alkylated state or the oxidized state was suitable to the study of the functional role of the conformational flexibility of helices 1 and 5. The results obtained in the kinetics of formation of discoidal lipoproteins clearly showed that in the oxidized state the disulfide mutant is unable to promote the formation of discoidal lipoproteins when incubated with either DMPC or DMPG liposomes. These results indicate that the separation of helices 1 and 5 constitutes a key step in the formation of discoidal lipoproteins.Alternative mechanisms for the exposure of the hydrophobic core of the disulfide-tethered protein are in principle available. For instance, the helical bundle of the disulfide-tethered apoLp-III could still relax and expose its hydrophobic core to the lipid surface by breaking the interactions between any of the other four pairs of neighboring α-helices or by a mechanism similar to that proposed by Breiteret al. (3Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesemberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), in which the interactions between two pairs of helices are simultaneously broken. In this regard, a recent study of disulfide mutants of apoE clearly showed that alternative mechanisms of opening of the helix bundle are available to apoE (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The study with human apoE showed that tethering any of the four contiguous pairs of α-helices with a disulfide bond was not enough to prevent the formation of discoidal lipoproteins. Three disulfide bonds, which effectively prevented opening of the helix bundle, were required to abolish the ability of apoE to spontaneously interact with DMPC liposomes and form discoidal lipoproteins (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Given the similarities in structure and functional properties shared by the N-terminal domain of human apoE and the full-length apoLp-III (1Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the demonstration that alternative lipid-binding mechanisms are available for human apoE (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it was particularly surprising to find that only one disulfide bond was able to abolish the ability of apoLp-III to form discoidal lipoproteins. The inability of the disulfide mutant of apoLp-III to form discoidal lipoproteins clearly indicates that the conformational freedom of helices 1 and 5 is essential to the lipid binding process and cannot be substituted by alternative conformational changes.The association of apolipoproteins with a lipid surface is a complex process that involves several steps including protein conformational changes as well as changes in the structure of the lipid surface. Because of this complexity, the elucidation of the key steps and energy barriers involved in the apolipoprotein-lipid interaction is a difficult task. Evidence for the existence of at least two binding steps has been reported for apoE (9Soulages J.L. Salamon Z. Wells M.A. Tollin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5650-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and for apoLp-III (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The initial binding step of the apolipoprotein to the lipid surface may be envisaged as an adsorption process and could involve a small protein domain. This small domain could be a permanent surface domain or a result of short range conformational fluctuations. Contrarily, to reach the final lipid-bound state, which involves the interaction of large helical regions with the lipid surface, the apolipoprotein must undergo a major conformational change. This conformational change is likely to take place in several steps that gradually increase the extent of the lipid-protein interaction to achieve the final lipid-bound state. Among these steps, long range concerted movements of entire helices might be needed. The fact that tethering the helices 1 and 5 of apoLp-III renders an inactive apolipoprotein suggests that the movement of helices 1 and/or 5 away from the helix bundle constitutes one of the key and early steps along the complex pathway for the formation of the final apolipoprotein lipid-bound state. Further investigations on the role of helices 1 and 5 in the lipid-protein interaction will be necessary to obtain additional insights into the mechanism of lipid binding. In this regard, the study of the arrangement of the helices in the lipid-bound state may prove to be useful for the understanding of the relevance of helices 1 and 5 in the lipid binding process. Apolipophorin-III (apoLp-III)1 is an exchangeable apolipoprotein found in the hemolymph of many insect species in a lipid-free state or bound to the major insect lipoprotein, lipophorin. (1Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 371-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of apoLp-III from two different insect species has been solved. The structures of Locusta migratoria and Manduca sexta apoLp-III were determined by x-ray crystallography (3Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesemberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and NMR spectroscopy (4Wang J. Gagné S.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17912-17920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), respectively. The structure of apoLp-III is described as an elongated bundle of five amphipathic α-helices, where the nonpolar faces of the helices are oriented toward the protein core. A similar structure, but consisting of a four-helix bundle, is present in the N-terminal domain of human apoE (5Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). M. sexta and L. migratoria apoLp-III share a large number of physical-chemical properties with the apolipoproteins from humans and other vertebrates (1Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. de Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J.

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1976-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the common features of exchangeable apolipoproteins are their ability to reversibly bind to lipoprotein surfaces, their content and type of amphipathic α-helices (6Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. de Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their ability to form discoidal lipoprotein particles (8Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Sparrow J.T. Gotto Jr., A.M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Plasma Lipoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 95-127Google Scholar). The association of apolipoproteins with lipids is a complex process that involves several steps including protein conformational changes and the disruption of the structure of the phospholipid monolayer or bilayer. Because of this complexity, the elucidation of the limiting steps and energy barriers involved in the formation of lipoproteins is also a complex task. Two processes were clearly distinguished in binding of apoLp-III to a planar lipid bilayer (9Soulages J.L. Salamon Z. Wells M.A. Tollin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5650-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); the first process consisted in an adsorption of apoLp-III to the phospholipid bilayer, whereas the second process involved the insertion of the protein into the lipid bilayer and the formation of lipoprotein complexes (9Soulages J.L. Salamon Z. Wells M.A. Tollin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5650-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A recent study with disulfide mutants of apoE has shown that three binding steps involving different conformations of the protein can be distinguished along the pathway that leads to the formation of discoidal lipoproteins of apoE and DMPC (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The initial binding step(s) of the apolipoprotein to the lipid surface may be envisaged as an adsorption process involving small structural changes in the protein. On the other hand, large conformational changes may be needed to achieve the final lipid-bound state, which is thought to involve major interactions between the nonpolar faces of the amphipathic α-helices and the lipid surface (6Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. de Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Smith A.F. Owen L.M. Strobel L.M.

Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4605-4612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the conformational flexibility is expected to be particularly important for apolipoproteins that have a defined tertiary structure, such as apoA-I, apoE, and apoLp-III. The nonpolar sides of the amphipathic α-helices of these apolipoproteins are mostly buried in the protein core, unavailable for interaction with a lipid surface. A recent spectroscopic study of single Trp mutants of L. migratoriaapoLp-III in the lipid-free state showed that the helices 1 and 5 are characterized by a greater hydration and mobility than helices 2–4 (13Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17501-17509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On the basis of the conformational flexibility of helices 1 and 5 and the relevance of this property to the function of an exchangeable apolipoprotein, we suggested that the separation of the helices 1 and 5 could constitute an important step in the exposure of the hydrophobic core of the protein that is required to achieve the lipid-bound state (13Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17501-17509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the validity of this model, we have designed a double Cys mutant, which allowed us to tether the helices 1 and 5 of apoLp-III and test the role of their conformational flexibility in the lipid binding properties of the apolipoprotein. The results of this study demonstrate an essential role of the conformational flexibility of the N- and C-terminal helices in the lipid binding activity of the apoLp-III. DISCUSSIONDepending on the structure of the lipoprotein, two models are used to describe the interaction of the α-helices of exchangeable apolipoproteins with lipoprotein-lipid surfaces. For spherical lipoproteins, it has been proposed (6Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. de Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the amphipathic α-helices have an orientation parallel to the phospholipid monolayer surface. In this case, the hydrophobic faces of the helices are embedded in the phospholipid monolayer, whereas the hydrophilic faces remain at the lipid surface and strengthen the lipid-protein interaction by means of ionic interactions with the charged groups of the phospholipid. On the other hand, in discoidal lipoprotein particles, the apolipoprotein is assumed to stabilize the lipoprotein particle by interacting with the acyl chains along the periphery of the lipid bilayer disc (8Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Sparrow J.T. Gotto Jr., A.M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Plasma Lipoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 95-127Google Scholar, 12Wientzek M. Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4605-4612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Klon A.E. Sheldahl C.J. Hellinger M. De Loof H. Harvey S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31755-31758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 21De Pauw M. Vanloo B. Weisgraber K. Rosseneu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Raussens V. Narayanaswami V. Goormaghtigh E. Ryan R.O. Ruysschaert J-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12542-12547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In any of these two possible final lipid-bound states of the apolipoprotein, a massive interaction of the helices with the lipoprotein lipid surface is thought to take place. Therefore, the achievement of the final lipid-bound state must involve a massive conformational change probably involving the displacement of entire helices to allow the exposure of the protein hydrophobic core. This conformational change is expected to occur at least in some apolipoproteins, such as apoLp-III, apoE, and apoA-I, for which most nonpolar domains of the amphipathic α-helices are buried in the protein core. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the conformational flexibility of the apolipoprotein may play a major role in the lipid-binding process. Two alternative models have been introduced to explain the mechanism of opening of the helix bundle of apoLp-III required for the interaction with the lipid. The first model was introduced by Breiter et al. (3Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesemberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), who on the basis of the crystal structure of apoLp-III and previous studies suggesting that apoLp-III could adopt two conformations at the water-air interface (23Kawooya J.K. Meredith S.C. Wells M.A. Kézdy F.J. Law J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13588-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) postulated that the five-helix bundle undergoes a lipid-triggered opening at putative hinge domains located between helices 2 and 3 and between helices 4 and 5. This opening would expose a large extent of the hydrophobic interior of the protein allowing the lipid-protein interaction required for the final lipid-bound state. However, a subsequent study with M. Sexta apoLp-III showed that cross-linking of the loops connecting helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 did not prevent the apolipoprotein molecule from interacting with DMPC and forming recombinant lipoprotein particles (24Narayanaswami V. Wang J. Kay C.M. Scraba D.G. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26855-26862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can infer that this mechanism is not taking place or that alternative mechanisms for the exposure of the hydrophobic domains can take place when the loops are tethered. We have recently introduced a second model proposing that one of the early conformational changes of apoLp-III during the lipid-binding process could involve spreading apart helices 1 and 5 (13Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17501-17509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This model was based on experimental data indicating that helices 2–4 of apoLp-III constituted a well packed domain, whereas helices 1 and 5 were more mobile and hydrated as well as on the assumption that the conformational flexibility constitutes a key property of exchangeable apolipoproteins (13Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17501-17509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To test the validity of this model, we investigated the effect of decreasing the conformational flexibility of helices 1 and 5 on the lipid binding activity of the apolipoprotein. For this purpose, we constructed a double Cys mutant that in the disulfide state tethered the centers of helices 1 and 5 of apoLp-III. The structure of this mutant as studied by circular dichroism indicated that the mutations and the formation of the disulfide bond did not introduce a major perturbation in the secondary structure of the protein. Moreover, the internal packing of the protein, as determined by the packing constraints of the single Trp residue, was not altered, indicating that the disulfide mutant in either the alkylated state or the oxidized state was suitable to the study of the functional role of the conformational flexibility of helices 1 and 5. The results obtained in the kinetics of formation of discoidal lipoproteins clearly showed that in the oxidized state the disulfide mutant is unable to promote the formation of discoidal lipoproteins when incubated with either DMPC or DMPG liposomes. These results indicate that the separation of helices 1 and 5 constitutes a key step in the formation of discoidal lipoproteins.Alternative mechanisms for the exposure of the hydrophobic core of the disulfide-tethered protein are in principle available. For instance, the helical bundle of the disulfide-tethered apoLp-III could still relax and expose its hydrophobic core to the lipid surface by breaking the interactions between any of the other four pairs of neighboring α-helices or by a mechanism similar to that proposed by Breiteret al. (3Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesemberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), in which the interactions between two pairs of helices are simultaneously broken. In this regard, a recent study of disulfide mutants of apoE clearly showed that alternative mechanisms of opening of the helix bundle are available to apoE (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The study with human apoE showed that tethering any of the four contiguous pairs of α-helices with a disulfide bond was not enough to prevent the formation of discoidal lipoproteins. Three disulfide bonds, which effectively prevented opening of the helix bundle, were required to abolish the ability of apoE to spontaneously interact with DMPC liposomes and form discoidal lipoproteins (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Given the similarities in structure and functional properties shared by the N-terminal domain of human apoE and the full-length apoLp-III (1Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the demonstration that alternative lipid-binding mechanisms are available for human apoE (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it was particularly surprising to find that only one disulfide bond was able to abolish the ability of apoLp-III to form discoidal lipoproteins. The inability of the disulfide mutant of apoLp-III to form discoidal lipoproteins clearly indicates that the conformational freedom of helices 1 and 5 is essential to the lipid binding process and cannot be substituted by alternative conformational changes.The association of apolipoproteins with a lipid surface is a complex process that involves several steps including protein conformational changes as well as changes in the structure of the lipid surface. Because of this complexity, the elucidation of the key steps and energy barriers involved in the apolipoprotein-lipid interaction is a difficult task. Evidence for the existence of at least two binding steps has been reported for apoE (9Soulages J.L. Salamon Z. Wells M.A. Tollin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5650-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and for apoLp-III (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The initial binding step of the apolipoprotein to the lipid surface may be envisaged as an adsorption process and could involve a small protein domain. This small domain could be a permanent surface domain or a result of short range conformational fluctuations. Contrarily, to reach the final lipid-bound state, which involves the interaction of large helical regions with the lipid surface, the apolipoprotein must undergo a major conformational change. This conformational change is likely to take place in several steps that gradually increase the extent of the lipid-protein interaction to achieve the final lipid-bound state. Among these steps, long range concerted movements of entire helices might be needed. The fact that tethering the helices 1 and 5 of apoLp-III renders an inactive apolipoprotein suggests that the movement of helices 1 and/or 5 away from the helix bundle constitutes one of the key and early steps along the complex pathway for the formation of the final apolipoprotein lipid-bound state. Further investigations on the role of helices 1 and 5 in the lipid-protein interaction will be necessary to obtain additional insights into the mechanism of lipid binding. In this regard, the study of the arrangement of the helices in the lipid-bound state may prove to be useful for the understanding of the relevance of helices 1 and 5 in the lipid binding process.

In this regard, a recent study of disulfide mutants of apoE clearly showed that alternative mechanisms of opening of the helix bundle are available to apoE (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The study with human apoE showed that tethering any of the four contiguous pairs of α-helices with a disulfide bond was not enough to prevent the formation of discoidal lipoproteins. Three disulfide bonds, which effectively prevented opening of the helix bundle, were required to abolish the ability of apoE to spontaneously interact with DMPC liposomes and form discoidal lipoproteins (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Given the similarities in structure and functional properties shared by the N-terminal domain of human apoE and the full-length apoLp-III (1Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the demonstration that alternative lipid-binding mechanisms are available for human apoE (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it was particularly surprising to find that only one disulfide bond was able to abolish the ability of apoLp-III to form discoidal lipoproteins. The inability of the disulfide mutant of apoLp-III to form discoidal lipoproteins clearly indicates that the conformational freedom of helices 1 and 5 is essential to the lipid binding process and cannot be substituted by alternative conformational changes. The association of apolipoproteins with a lipid surface is a complex process that involves several steps including protein conformational changes as well as changes in the structure of the lipid surface. Because of this complexity, the elucidation of the key steps and energy barriers involved in the apolipoprotein-lipid interaction is a difficult task. Evidence for the existence of at least two binding steps has been reported for apoE (9Soulages J.L. Salamon Z. Wells M.A. Tollin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5650-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and for apoLp-III (10Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The initial binding step of the apolipoprotein to the lipid surface may be envisaged as an adsorption process and could involve a small protein domain. This small domain could be a permanent surface domain or a result of short range conformational fluctuations. Contrarily, to reach the final lipid-bound state, which involves the interaction of large helical regions with the lipid surface, the apolipoprotein must undergo a major conformational change. This conformational change is likely to take place in several steps that gradually increase the extent of the lipid-protein interaction to achieve the final lipid-bound state. Among these steps, long range concerted movements of entire helices might be needed. The fact that tethering the helices 1 and 5 of apoLp-III renders an inactive apolipoprotein suggests that the movement of helices 1 and/or 5 away from the helix bundle constitutes one of the key and early steps along the complex pathway for the formation of the final apolipoprotein lipid-bound state. Further investigations on the role of helices 1 and 5 in the lipid-protein interaction will be necessary to obtain additional insights into the mechanism of lipid binding. In this regard, the study of the arrangement of the helices in the lipid-bound state may prove to be useful for the understanding of the relevance of helices 1 and 5 in the lipid binding process."

Within the proximal 2 kilobases, and with opposite transcriptional orientation, is located the promoter-enhancer of a second gene, which does not affectCD53. Twenty-four copies of a CA dinucleotide repeat separate these two gene promoters. The proximal enhanceosome of the human CD53 gene is comprised between residues −266 and +84, and can be subdivided into four major subregions, two of them within exon 1. Mutational analysis identified several cooperating sequences. An Sp1 and an ets-1 site, at positions −115 and +62, respectively, are essential for transcriptional competence in all cell lines. Five other regulatory sequences have a dual role, activator or down-regulator, depending on the cell line. At the end of the non-coding exon 1, +64 to +83, there is a second ets-1 regulatory element, which is required for high level of transcription, in cooperation with the Sp1 site, in K562 and Molt-4, but not in Namalwa cells, where it functions as a repressor. This Sp1 site also cooperates with another ets-1/PU.1 site at −172. Different cell types use different regulatory sequences in the enhanceosome for the expression of the same gene.

Different cell types use different regulatory sequences in the enhanceosome for the expression of the same gene. nucleotide Gene regulation in a specific cell type requires the cooperation of several cis-acting DNA regulatory sequences, which are binding sites for proteins that transmit molecular signals to genes (1Blackwood E.M. Kadonoga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). These sequences bind regulatory proteins and form complexes known as enhanceosomes (2Carey M. Cell. 1998; 92: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 3Merika M. Thanos D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The CD53 gene codes for an antigen that belongs to the tetraspanin family of membrane proteins. These proteins are very hydrophobic and consist of four transmembrane domains with polar residues, and have a small and a large extra cellular loop; the latter appears to be responsible for the functional specificity of each individual tetraspanin protein (4Horejsi V. Vlcek C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Maecker H.T. Todd S., C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). CD53 was originally reported to be a pan leukocyte antigen, whose expression is mostly restricted to the lymphoid-myeloid lineage (4Horejsi V. Vlcek C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recent data suggests that tetraspanin proteins play an important role as co-stimulatory molecules in several cell types (5Maecker H.T. Todd S., C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Ligation of the CD53 antigen with monoclonal antibodies modulates several biological processes. Among them are intracellular calcium mobilization in human B-cells and monocytes (6Olweus J. Lund-Johansen F. Horejsi V. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 707-716PubMed Google Scholar) and rat macrophages (7Boscá L. Lazo P.A. J. Exp.

Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1119-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). No ligand is known for any tetraspanin antigen. Tetraspanin antigens form a protein complex with several integrins on the cell membrane, which might require a coordinated expression of their genes (10Rubinstein E. La Naour F.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Loss of CD53 antigen surface level has been reported in a family with CD53 deficiency, which is characterized by the occurrence of recurrent and heterogeneous infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, and fungi (14Mollinedo F. Fontán G. Barasoaı́n I. Lazo P.A. Clin. Diag. Lab.

Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 3955-3994Google Scholar). Also, down-regulation of several tetraspanin antigen gene expression, such as CD9, CD82/KAI1, and CD63, has been correlated with poor prognosis in several types of tumors, including breast, melanoma, lung, prostate, pancreas, and esophageal carcinoma (16Higashiyama M.

Miyake M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These effects might be a consequence of the tetraspan-integrin interaction and their corresponding effects on cellular motility and adhesion (13Berditchevski F. Odintsova E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In all these situations, the correlation was performed for a unique member of the tetraspanin family. However, an individual cell expresses simultaneously from 5 to 10 members of this protein family (10Rubinstein E. La Naour F. Lagaudriere-Gesbert C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J.

J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), lymphomas (31Ferrer M. Yunta M. Lazo P.A. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 773Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and carcinomas. 1M. Ferrer, M. Yunta, and P. A. Lazo, unpublished observations. The reduction in levels of an individual protein represents a change in the composition of such complexes (32Hemler M.E. Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 67-71PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of low-level expression of any given antigen should be considered in the context of the multiple antigen expression. To understand the coordinated expression of genes coding for tetraspanin antigens, which are located on different chromosomes, it is necessary to characterize their gene regulatory regions. Very few promoters of this growing gene family have been characterized. Only theCD9 promoter (33Le Naour F. Prenan M. Francastel C. Rubinstein E. Uzan G. Boucheix C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 481-486PubMed Google Scholar, 34Le Naour F. Francastel C. Prenant M. Lantz O. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the CD63 promoter (35Hotta H. Takahashi N. Homma M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1989; 80: 1186-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar,36Takahashi N. Hotta H. Homma M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1991; 82: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have been studied in some detail, and the genomic location of theCD53 transcription initiation site has also been identified (37Korinek V. Horejsi V. Immunogenetics. 1993; 38: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this report we have cloned and characterized the promoter region of the human CD53 gene. By mutational analysis several cis-acting DNA regulatory sequences were identified, which cooperate and contribute to CD53 gene expression in different cell types. Several of these new regulatory elements are located within the non-coding exon 1. Some of these regulatory sequences function as positive or negative elements depending on the structure of the enhanceosome in each cell type. The basicCD53 regulatory region has an Sp1 sequence that cooperates with several ets-1 sequences. Also the promoter-enhancer of a very proximal second gene does not interfere with the CD53promoter activity. To isolate the CD53 gene promoter we used a human genomic library from a 3-year-old caucasian male made by partial EcoRI digestion and cloned in phage λFIX (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The library was screened with a cDNA clone made by primer extension of the 5′-untranslated region of human CD53 message kindly provided by V. Horejsi (Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague) (37Korinek V. Horejsi V. Immunogenetics. 1993; 38: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The positive genomic clones were mapped by partial digestion of the inserts with several restriction enzymes, followed by hybridization to end-labeled T3 or T7 primers, present in the cloning vector, as probes. Conditions for primer hybridization and filter washes have been previously reported (38Gallego M.I. Shoenmakers E.P.F.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. Lazo P.A. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Location of the non-translated first exon was done by Southern blot hybridization under conditions previously reported (39Gallego M.I. Lazo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24321-24326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The genomic clone was digested with selected restriction enzymes and subcloned in plasmid pBluescript SKII(−) The subclones were linearized and nested deletions were made using exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease with a commercial kit (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxynucleotide termination method according to the T7 DNA polymerase Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The products were analyzed in 7% polyacrylamide gels with urea. The dried gel was exposed to Fuji-RX film (Fuji, Japan). Alternatively they were sequenced with a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) usingThermus aquaticus FS polymerase and universal M13-forward and reverse primers. Sequences were resolved in an ABI PRISM 377 automatic DNA sequencer and the results were processed with the ABI Analysis software (version 2.1). Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed using the PCGene and OMIGA packages from Oxford Molecular (Oxford, United Kingdom). The nucleotide sequence with the two promoters, CD53 and the new transcriptional unit has GenBankTM accession number AJ243474. To detect specific DNA motifs specific for regulatory elements, such as enhancers and transcription factors, the sequence was analyzed with the Transfac 4.0 program (Gesellschaft für Biotechnolosgische Forschung, Braunschweig, Germany) (40Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T. Pruss M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted following the guanidinium thiocyanate-chloroform method (41Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (63222) Google Scholar), as previously described (42Feduchi E. Gallego M.I. Lazo P.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To extend the novel gene an antisense oligonucleotide (GENA2) was used, 5′-GAGAGCTCGTGAGACAGAACTAG-3′ (positions −2175 to −2152 in the sequence). The extension was performed with Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase according to the manufactures instructions (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). The extended products were analyzed in a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel. The radioactivity in the gel was detected by autoradiography with Kodak XAR-5 film, or directly with a FUJIBAS1000 PhosphorImager (Fuji, Fuji, Japan). To characterize the regulatory region, DNA fragments were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Selected regions of the humanCD53 promoter sequence were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific oligonucleotides to defined regions upstream and downstream of the transcription start site, which are indicated in the experiments, designed based on the CD53 genomic sequence, and ∼30 nucleotides long. Pairs of primers were used for the polymerase chain reaction for amplification of selected genomic regions. These primers contained, at their ends, the suitable restriction sites,MluI and SmaI, for subcloning into the appropriate luciferase reporter vector of the pGL2 family (Promega, Madison, WI). All the constructs were cloned in the pGL2-Basic, that lacks both SV40 enhancer and promoter sequences, and in some cases in the pGL2-Promoter vector that lacks the SV40 enhancer sequence, but retains the SV40 promoter. As positive control, we used the pGL2-control plasmid containing both SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences. The empty pGL2-Basic that lacks promoter or enhancer sequences was also used as negative control. To introduce point mutations at specific nucleotide locations we used the Quick Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. To generate the mutant, two complementary primers containing the desired mutation in its center were designed and used to copy a target sequence with the Pfu polymerase, in such a way that the whole plasmid was copied. The input DNA was digested with DpnI that only cuts the input plasmid of bacterial origin because of its methylation, but does not cut the DNA made by the Pfu polymerase. The remaining DNA was used to transfect DH5αF Escherichia coli strain and isolate new plasmid constructs with the desired mutation. All mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequence. For internal control of transfection and normalization we used plasmid pCMV-gal (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) with the β-galactosidase gene. Also we used the dual luciferase Renilla system for normalization (Promega, Madison, WI). The generated light was detected with an OPTOCOM-1 luminometer (MGM Instruments, Inc., Hamden, CT). The Molt-4 cell line from a T-cell lymphoma; the K562 cell line from a chronic myelogenous leukemia; and the Namalwa B-cell line, derived from a Burkitt lymphoma, was used for transfection experiments. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The cell lines were transfected by electroporation with 10 μg of the corresponding plasmid DNA using a Gene-Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). The electroporation conditions were 250 volts and 960 μF for Molt-4 cells, 300 volts and 500 μF for Namalwa cells, and 280 volts and 960 μF for K562 cells. The phenotype of the cell lines was determined by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur form Becton-Dickinson. The CD53 antigen was detected with monoclonal antibody MEM53, and as secondary antibody we used a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody from Sigma. Cells were grown to a density of 5 × 106 cells as indicated. For total protein extracts we used 6 × 107 cells that were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 600 μl of RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1% aprotinin, 1% leupeptin, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The cell suspension was passed through a needle to break the DNA. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as the total protein extract. The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The proteins were fractionated in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel loaded with 50 μg of total protein. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, CT) in a Bio-Rad Trans-blot cell. The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), 0.1% Tween buffer. In Western blots, the first antibody indicated in the figure was used at a 1/1000 dilution, and for detection we used protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Pharmacia Biotech) at 1/1000 dilution or anti-mouse or anti-goat IgG antibodies coupled to peroxidase. The blots were developed using an ECL chemiluminiscence kit from Amersham. For the transcription factor Sp1 we used a mouse monoclonal antibody, 1C6, from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). For Sp2 and Sp3 we used rabbit polyclonal antibodies, K-20 and D-20, respectively, from Santa Cruz. The ets-1 transcription factor was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody, N-276, from Santa Cruz. The PU.1 protein was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody, T-21, from Santa Cruz. E4BP4 protein was detected with a goat polyclonal, V-19, and GATA1 transcription factor with goat polyclonal, C-20, both from Santa Cruz. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) proteins were detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody, 06-348, from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). To characterize the human CD53 gene promoter, located on chromosome region 1p13 (43Gónzalez M.E. Pardo-Manuel de Villena F. Fernández-Ruiz E. Rodriguez de Córdoba S. Lazo P.A. Genomics. 1993; 18: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we cloned the upstream regulatory region by screening a normal individual genomic library with a partial cDNA probe. The probe, clone pPET/XAG, was derived by primer extension of the poly(A)+ RNA, and contained only the 5′ non-translated sequence (37Korinek V. Horejsi V. Immunogenetics. 1993; 38: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). With this probe a genomic clone, λJHT1, containing 20 kilobase pairs was isolated. The restriction map of the genomic clone is shown in Fig. 1. The location of the region containing the beginning of the CD53transcriptional unit was determined by hybridization to the same probe used for library screening (Fig. 1). From the phage clone we made several subclones in plasmid pBluescript SK-II containing theXbaI and the EcoRI-HindIII region that comprises the start of the CD53 transcribed sequences. We sequenced a region of 3613 nucleotides (GenBankTM accession number AJ243474) surrounding the CD53 start site (Fig.2). The CD53 gene lacks a TATA box, but has a sequence that plays its role, as well as a capping site (37Korinek V. Horejsi V. Immunogenetics. 1993; 38: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The sequence was analyzed with the Transfac 4.0 program to detect sequences that are recognized by transcription factors (40Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T.

Some of these regulatory elements are located within the non-coding exon 1 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of the proximal region surrounding the transcription start site of CD53 and containing its proximal enhancer-promoter; the location of consensus sequences corresponding to known transcription factors is indicated. This sequence is within the clone comprising the humanCD53 gene promoter from position −2562 to +1051 (EBI/GenBankTM accession number AJ243474), which includes the promoter-enhancer of an unknown gene (gene A in this report). The two gene promoter-enhancers are separated by 24 copies of a CA dinucleotide repeat.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The analysis of the nucleotide sequence upstream of theCD53 promoter also detected a putative TATA box located in the −2000 region approximately; with opposite orientation with respect to the CD53 gene start site (Fig. 1). The presence of such an unknown gene was confirmed by the sequencing of the human genome, which is located upstream and proximal of the humanCD53 promoter in chromosome 1p13.3 (46Lander E.S.

Before proceeding to characterize the CD53 promoter we confirmed that there is indeed a start site for an unknown transcriptional unit, called gene A, by performing a primer extension assay using as target RNA from two different cell lines, Molt-4 and K562 (data not shown). To functionally demonstrate that there is a second enhancer-promoter from another gene proximal to CD53 we subcloned it upstream of a luciferase reporter gene in the pGL2-B (basic) vector. The constructs were of increasing length till the CD53 promoter was included in the antisense orientation. In the region from −1837 to −2127 there is a very strong enhancer-promoter that is even stronger, in the three cell lines tested, than the positive control containing the SV40 enhancer-promoter used as positive activation control (Fig.3). As the length of DNA toward theCD53 promoter was increased, there was a significant drop in the activity of this novel enhancer-promoter, the major drop in luciferase activity occurred when the region located between −1533 to −489 was included in the construct. This region has 24 copies of a CA dinucleotide repeat which is located between positions −1361 to −1313. The CA repeat is thus located between the two promoters. The inclusion of the CD53 enhancer, present in constructs extending to the +137 and +322 positions, did not prevent the drop in the activity of gene A promoter-enhancer (Fig. 3), suggesting that the presence of the CD53 promoter-enhancer does not affect this novel transcriptional unit. The relative strength of the gene A promoter-enhancer (−1837 to −2127) is stronger than the SV40 control (pGL2-C vector) in the three cell lines. To characterize the proximal regulatory region of the human CD53 gene we used three different cell lines from the lymphoid-myeloid lineage, such as K562 derived from an erythroleukemia, Molt-4 derived from a T-cell lymphoma, and Namalwa cells derived from a Burkitt lymphoma, a B-cell tumor. The three cell lines expressed CD53 antigen on their surface as determined by flow cytometry analysis (Fig.4). The expression levels in the three cell lines were also determined at the RNA level by a Northern blot (not shown). Therefore, these different cells lines can be used to ascertain if the same regulatory elements to determine the transcriptional activity of the CD53 promoter in the three cells lines, or alternatively if the proximal enhanceosome or transcriptional complex (2Carey M. Cell. 1998; 92: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) is different in each cell line, although located in the same genomic region. First, to identify the location of the major regulatory elements within the human CD53 gene regulatory region, several constructs were made from −2157 to the +1 position using vectors pGL2-B (without enhancer-promoter) and pGL2-E (lacks the promoter, but has the SV40 enhancer). With both vectors the results obtained were similar, therefore we continued the analysis using only the constructs made in the pGL2-B vector. The activation of transcription was studied in three cell lines: K562, Molt-4, and Namalwa. The proximal region between nucleotides −266 and +1 (Fig. 5) appeared to contain most of the sequences required for expression of the CD53 gene, and in the three cell lines, the values were similar to those of the positive control with the SV40 promoter-enhancer. The effect from the −266 to −998 sequence was heterogeneous and no conclusion could be drawn from it. Although in Molt-4 cells, the region between −509 and −667 resulted in a 2-fold increase in the activity of the proximalCD53 region (Fig. 5). The inclusion of the gene A enhancer-promoter and the CA repeat, up to position −2157, did not significantly affect the CD53 promoter in K562 cells, but resulted in a drop in activity in Molt-4 and Namalwa cells, although still with a relative high-level transcriptional activity with respect to the empty vector (Fig. 5). We conclude that the major determinant of the transcriptional activity of the humanCD53 gene regulatory region is very proximal to the +1 position. To further character"

Suec. 1978; 15: 133-140PubMed Google Scholar). It was initially described as a tumor promoting agent with ability to induce rapid Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (4Jackson T.R. Patterson S.I. Thastrup O. Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The effect was later recognized to be indirect since TG inhibits the Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum membrane (5Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar, 6Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 7Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also established that equimolar TG with respect to the enzyme concentration is sufficient to produce complete inhibition of the ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport (6Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Nowadays, TG is a key molecule for investigating the selective mobilization of Ca2+ from the intracellular reticula. A combined approach including kinetics and molecular biology techniques as well as structural data have provided important clues on the inhibitory effect of TG. For instance, it has been shown that TG inhibits Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP and enzyme phosphorylation by inorganic phosphate in the absence of Ca2+ (8Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the inhibition has been related to the Ca2+-free conformation of the enzyme (6Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 8Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wictome M. Henderson I. Lee A.G. East J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Some transient protection by Ca2+ when EP was formed from ATP and the accumulation of a dead end complex as a consequence of the enzyme turnover has also been observed (10Sagara Y. Fernandez-Belda F. de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12606-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of TG and Ca2+ with the enzyme was described as involving mutual exclusion when a low free Ca2+ medium was used and the interaction of TG with the enzyme was reported as being irreversible when the experiments were performed at 25 °C (10Sagara Y. Fernandez-Belda F. de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12606-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As regards the location of the TG-binding domain, the use of a fluorescent TG derivative (11Hua S. Malak H. Lakowicz J.R. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5137-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or photolabeling with a radioactive azido derivative of TG (12Hua S. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11865-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) indicated that the binding occurs within or near the transmembrane region of the enzyme. More precise information was obtained by chimeric construct and site-directed mutagenesis after overexpression of the Ca2+-ATPase protein in COS-1 cells. These studies revealed that the TG-binding domain does not reside within the large cytoplasmic loop (13Sumbilla C. Lu L. Lewis D.E. Inesi G. Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Feng Y. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21185-21192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Location at the membrane interface and interaction with the S3 stalk segment between Asp254 and Leu260 have been suggested (14Zhong L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12994-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The S3 segment has also been related with the binding domain of the high affinity inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (15Ma H. Zhong L. Inesi G. Fortea I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15522-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this sense, the region around Phe256, where the structural elements M3, M4, and L67 gather, seems to be critical for Ca2+ binding (16Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). It is envisioned that the presence of TG might destabilize certain hydrogen bonds and, as a consequence, decrease Ca2+ binding affinity (16Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). We have now performed a systematic and in-depth study which will help to elucidate the interaction of TG with the enzyme and shed light on the inhibition mechanism of this highly specific inhibitor of the SR Ca2+-ATPase. TG was obtained from Molecular Probes Europe.A23187 from Streptomyces chartreusensis was obtained from Calbiochem. Stock solutions of TG or A23187 were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (ACS reagent). The Ca2+ standard solution (Titrisol) was a product of Merck. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The liquid scintillation mixture (S4023) and other reagents of analytical grade, including deoxycholate (D4297), were from Sigma. HAWP filter units with a pore diameter of 0.45 μm were from Millipore. Samples were manually filtered under vacuum in a Hoefer filtration box (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fast-twitch leg muscle obtained from adult female New Zealand rabbit was the starting material. A microsomal fraction enriched in longitudinal tubules of the SR membrane was prepared by differential centrifugation according to Eletr and Inesi (17Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Purified Ca2+-ATPase was obtained by method 2 of Meissner et al. (18Meissner G. Conner G.E. Fleischer S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 298: 246-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Fig. 1shows protein staining of the preparations after SDS-electrophoresis (19Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C until use. The protein concentration was estimated by the colorimetric procedure of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. One mg of SR protein contains ∼4 nmol of active enzyme, as deduced from the maximal phosphorylation level, so that a vesicular protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml is equivalent to 0.8 μm Ca2+-ATPase. The ionized free Ca2+ concentration was fixed by adding given volumes of CaCl2 and/or EGTA stock solutions. Theoretical values were calculated by a computer program as previously described (21Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The procedure takes into consideration the absolute stability constant for the Ca2+-EGTA complex (22Schwartzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1957; 40: 1886-1900Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the pK values for the EGTA protonation (23Blinks J. Wier W. Hess P. Prendergast F. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 40: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), pH, and the presence of relevant ligands in the medium. SR vesicles in the absence of free Ca2+ was named theE2 medium and consisted of 20 mmMops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml SR vesicles, and 15 μm A23187. TheE1Ca2 (10 μm) medium was prepared by adding 0.105 mm CaCl2 to the Ca2+-free medium, whereas theE1Ca2 (3 mm) medium contained 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml SR vesicles, 15 μm A23187, and 3.1 mmCaCl2. Aliquots of 0.5 ml containingE2 or E1Ca2samples were preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min with TG. The phosphorylation of E1Ca2 after preincubation with TG was preceded by a brief incubation at 0 °C for 1 min. Phosphorylation of E2 plus TG required the preliminary addition of 0.105 mm CaCl2 (10 μm free Ca2+) and the subsequent incubation at 0 °C for 1 min. In all cases, samples were phosphorylated at 0 °C with 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP as described below. The phosphorylation reaction was initiated at 0 °C by adding 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP (∼50,000 cpm/nmol) to 0.5 ml of SR vesicles preincubated with TG in the presence of Ca2+. The reaction was stopped (usually after 1 s) by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold quenching solution (125 mm perchloric acid plus 2 mm phosphate). The quenched mixture was incubated in an ice bath for 5 additional min and then filtered under vacuum on nitrocellulose filter. Filters were rinsed with 25 ml of ice-cold quenching solution. The radioactivity retained by the filters was measured by the liquid scintillation technique. SR vesicles were equilibrated at 25 °C in the presence of Ca2+. The initial medium was 20 mmMops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml SR vesicles, 15 μm A23187 and one of the following CaCl2concentrations: 0.089, 0.105, 0.128, 0.149, 0.2, 0.4, 1.1, or 3.1 mm. This yielded pCa values ranging from 5.5 to 2.5 in half-unit intervals, and included the 4.3 value. The MgCl2 concentration was raised to 20 mm when the Ca2+ concentration was 3.1 mm. The addition of 0.8 μm TG to 0.5-ml aliquots ofE1Ca2 was followed by incubation at 25 °C for 5 min or at 37 °C for 1 h. Next, samples were cooled for 1 min in an ice bath before phosphorylation at 0 °C for 1 s with 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP. Aliquots of 0.5 ml containing 20 mmMops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml SR vesicles, and 15 μm A23187 (E2 medium with 20 mm Mg2+) were preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min with 0.8 μm TG. Then, 3.1 mmCaCl2 (3 mm free Ca2+) was added and the incubation was prolonged at 0, 25, or 37 °C for different time intervals. Samples were cooled for 1 min in an ice bath before phosphorylation at 0 °C for 1 s, as described before. Initial samples were 1-ml aliquots of the following media: E2, E2TG (i.e. E2 preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min with 0.8 μm TG) orE1Ca2(3 mm). Samples ofE2 medium were used as a control (without any addition) or were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min with 0.8 μm (equimolar) TG. E2TG samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 3.1 mmCa2+ (3 mm free Ca2+), whereasE1Ca2 (3 mm) was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min with 0.8 μm TG. Samples of E2 or E2 incubated with TG (0.55 ml) were centrifuged at room temperature for 1 min through small chromatography columns (38 × 10 mm) filled with Sephadex G-50 resin and pre-equilibrated in a Ca2+-free medium (20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA). Likewise, samples of E2TG incubated with Ca2+ or E1Ca2 (3 mm) incubated with TG (0.55 ml) were centrifuged through Sephadex columns pre-equilibrated in 3 mm free Ca2+ medium (20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 3.1 mm CaCl2). In all cases, the Sephadex columns were centrifuged at low speed for 1 min before use as previously described (24Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The filtrate from each column was diluted with 5 ml of medium to reach a final free Ca2+of 50 μm. The dilution medium forE2 samples or E2incubated with TG was 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.165 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 6 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 1.5 μm A23187. The dilution medium for E2TG incubated with 3 mm Ca2+ or E1Ca2(3 mm) incubated with TG was 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.22 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 6 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 1.5 μm A23187. The enzyme activity was measured at 37 °C in 1-ml aliquots of diluted samples. The ATP concentration was 50 μm and the procedure described by Lin and Morales was followed (25Lin T. Morales M. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 77: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The initial incubation medium (1.5 ml) contained 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.01 mg/ml SR protein, and 1 μm A23187. When indicated, 30 nm TG was also included. The incubation medium was maintained at 37 °C for 5 min. The rate of Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C by the method described by Lanzetta et al. (26Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) after addition of 0.15 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 6 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 50 μm ATP. Aliquots of 0.2 ml were withdrawn at different times and mixed with 0.8 ml of color reagent. The color development was stopped after 1 min by adding 0.1 ml of 34% sodium citrate and the absorbance at 660 nm was read 30 min later. A blank assay was performed by adding 0.2 ml of incubation medium into 0.8 ml of color reagent. After vortexing, 50 μm ATP was added and mixed. SR vesicles at 0.01 mg/ml in a medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 μmA23187 were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min with 30 nmTG. In some experiments the inhibitor was absent. A 10-, 40-, 60- or 100-fold dilution at 37 °C was performed by mixing 0.30, 0.075, 0.05, or 0.03 ml preincubation medium with 2.70, 2.925, 2.95, or 2.97 ml of dilution medium, respectively. The dilution medium was 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.15 mmCaCl2. After a fixed time of 2 h at 37 °C the diluted samples were supplemented with 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 6 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 50 μm ATP. The rate of the Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis was evaluated at 37 °C by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate (26Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) in 0.5-ml aliquots. A time-dependent study of samples preincubated with TG was also conducted. All the manipulations were performed at 37 °C. Leaky SR vesicles (0.01 mg/ml protein) in a Ca2+-free medium were preincubated with 30 nm TG and then 100-fold diluted in the medium containing 50 μm free Ca2+ as described before. Control experiments were performed without adding TG during preincubation. After dilution, aliquots of 3 ml were withdrawn at different time intervals to measure Ca2+-ATPase activity. Hydrolysis rates at each dilution time were evaluated in a medium containing 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 6 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 50 μm ATP, according to Lanzettaet al. (26Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity in the absence of free Ca2+ was measured at 25 °C using a preparation of purified Ca2+-ATPase (see Fig. 1). The initial reaction medium consisted of 20 mmMops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.4 mg/ml purified enzyme. Next, a given TG concentration was added and the incubation was prolonged at 25 °C for 5 min. The TG/enzyme molar ratio was varied in the range of 0.5 to 4. The hydrolytic reaction in 1-ml aliquots was started by adding 1 mm ATP, 1 mm UTP, or 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The release of inorganic phosphate from the nucleotides was evaluated by the procedure of Lin and Morales (25Lin T. Morales M. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 77: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate was followed by measuring the accumulation ofp-nitrophenol (27Fernandez-Belda F. Fortea M.I. Soler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7998-8004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Each plotted value corresponds to the average of at least three independent assays performed in duplicate. The standard deviation (plus or minus) for each assay is also given. The inhibitory effect of TG can be conveniently assessed by studying the capacity of the enzyme to be phosphorylated by ATP in the presence of Ca2+. Initially, SR vesicles in a 10 μm free Ca2+ medium were preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min with equimolar TG. Samples were subsequently transferred to an ice bath for 1 min and then 1–20-s phosphorylation was achieved by the sequential addition of 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP and acid quenching solution. An accumulation of approximately 0.5 nmol of EP/mg of protein from the initial time point was observed (closed circles in Fig.2A). As expected, the enzyme was fully phosphorylated when TG was not added during preincubation (open circles). A different pattern was observed when equimolar TG was added to SR vesicles in a 3 mm free Ca2+ medium. In this case, the EP accumulation showed an initial rise followed by a progressive decrease as the phosphorylation time was prolonged (closed squares in Fig.2B). The time course of EP formed under the same conditions but without TG added during preincubation is shown as a control (open squares). The transient protection by millimolar Ca2+ was also analyzed by changing the free Ca2+ added during preincubation and evaluating EP after brief phosphorylation (1 s at 0 °C with 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP). When equimolar TG was added to vesicles in a Ca2+-containing medium and the incubation lasted 5 min at 25 °C, EP increased as the Ca2+ concentration was raised (closed squares in Fig.3A). Maximal phosphorylation was obtained at 100 μm free Ca2+ although a tendency to decrease was observed at higher Ca2+concentrations. Control experiments performed in the absence of TG exhibited a decrease of EP from 3.2 to 2.1 when thepCa was raised from 5.5 to 2.5 (open squares). The TG effect is also shown as a percentage of EPversus pCa (closed squares in Fig.3B). Closed triangles in Fig. 3Bcorrespond to data obtained when the preincubation with equimolar TG was maintained for 1 h at 37 °C. It is apparent that half-maximal protection by Ca2+ decreased as the preincubation time was prolonged and the temperature was raised. The effect of TG was also studied when the enzyme was initially in theE2 conformation. To this end, SR vesicles in a nominally Ca2+-free medium were supplemented at 25 °C with a given TG concentration. Then, Ca2+ was added to reach a final 10 μm free concentration and the preincubation was maintained at 25 °C for 5 min. The TG effect was evaluated after 1 min incubation in an ice bath and 1 s phosphorylation at 0 °C by 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP. Preincubation ofE2TG with 10 μm free Ca2+ produced a TG-dependent inhibition of the accumulated EP (Fig. 4). EP was completely inhibited by 0.8 μm TG when the SR protein was 0.2 mg/ml, i.e. when the Ca2+-ATPase was 0.8 μm. This means that complete inhibition was observed when the TG/enzyme molar ratio was ≥1. The protective role of millimolar Ca2+ when added toE2TG was studied as follows: SR vesicles in a Ca2+-free medium were preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min with equimolar TG and then Ca2+ was added to reach a final 3 mm free concentration. The incubation was prolonged at 0, 25, or 37 °C and the samples taken at different times after adding Ca2+ were used to evaluate EP (1 s phosphorylation at 0 °C). Thus, the EP level increased in the minute time scale and was clearly dependent on temperature (Fig.5). The accumulation rate was very low when the incubation temperature in the presence of Ca2+ was 0 °C (open triangles). The rate was higher at 25 °C and EP reached values close to maximum when the Ca2+ incubation was maintained for 60 min (open squares). The recovery was even faster when the temperature was raised to 37 °C (open circles). Samples with no TG added during preincubation were also phosphorylated at 37 °C and in a 3 mm free Ca2+ medium and are shown as a reference (closed circles). The interaction of TG and Ca2+ with the enzyme was more deeply explored by using different preincubation protocols before the samples were subjected to gel filtration and the Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured (Fig.6). In all cases, the enzyme activity was measured at 37 °C in the same reaction medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm free Ca2+, 1.5 μm A23187, and 50 μm ATP in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. An initial sample of SR vesicles in the absence of Ca2+ (i.e. E2) was passed through a Sephadex column pre-equilibrated in a Ca2+-free medium. Once eluted from the column, the sample was diluted in the reaction medium containing 50 μm free Ca2+ and the enzyme activity was measured. After this treatment the rate of ATP hydrolysis was 3 μmol/min/mg of protein. However, the enzyme activity was only 0.14 whenE2 was preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min with equimolar TG. The Sephadex column pre-equilibrated in the absence of Ca2+ was unable to eliminate the inhibition even though the enzyme activity was measured in the 50 μm free Ca2+ medium described before. In another set of experiments, E2TG samples were preincubated with 3 mm free Ca2+ at 37 °C for 1 h and then passed through Sephadex, this time pre-equilibrated in 3 mm free Ca2+ medium. Samples from the column were diluted in the reaction medium containing 50 μm free Ca2+ and the enzyme activity was measured as before. Once again the enzyme activity in the presence of Ca2+ was low, only 0.11 μmol/min/mg of protein. The last protocol tried was preincubation at 25 °C for 5 min ofE1Ca2 (3 mm) with equimolar TG and then passage through Sephadex pre-equilibrated in 3 mm free Ca2+. The enzyme activity of samples diluted in the 50 μm free Ca2+ medium was 0.13 μmol/min/mg of protein. Under our assay conditions, that included 0.01 mg/ml SR protein and 50 μm ATP, half-maximal inhibition was observed at 19 nm TG (data not shown). Using the conditions of this experiment we studied the putative reversibility of TG. Leaky SR vesicles (0.01 mg/ml) in the absence of Ca2+ were first equilibrated with 30 nm TG and then diluted and incubated for a certain time span. Aliquots taken after dilution were used to evaluate Ca2+-ATPase activity. All the manipulations were carried out at 37 °C and the dilution medium contained 50 μm free Ca2+. Control experiments were performed without TG in preincubation. Data in Fig.7A correspond to samples diluted to different degrees and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. It is clear that enzyme activity recovery was dependent on the dilution factor (open bars). Data are expressed on a relative scale and the 100% value at each dilution corresponds to the enzyme activity when TG was absent during the preincubation. The time course of TG dissociation after a 100-fold dilution at 37 °C is also shown (Fig.7B). The initial preincubation conditions included 0.01 mg/ml SR protein and 30 nm TG. Additional data on the effect of TG were obtained by measuring the hydrolysis of phosphorylating substrates in a nominally Ca2+-free medium. These experiments were performed with a preparation of purified enzyme (Fig. 1) to exclude the participation of any other contaminating protein. The Ca2+-ATPase protein was able to hydrolyze different substrates in the absence of free Ca2+ (Fig. 8). The hydrolysis rate at 25 °C was 30 nmol/min/mg protein when the phosphorylating substrate was 1 mm ATP or 10.3 nmol/min/mg protein when the substrate was 1 mm UTP. The activity was 8.2 nmol/min/mg protein when 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate was used. It is remarkable that TG did not alter the hydrolysis rate of the phosphorylating substrates even when the molar ratio with respect to the enzyme concentration was raised to 4. The enzyme activity in the absence of Ca2+ was also studied as a function of the ATP concentration. The presence of TG did not alter the hyperbolic dependence on ATP concentration when the TG/enzyme molar ratio was raised to 10 (data not shown). The addition of [γ-32P]ATP toE1Ca2 leads to the formation of radioactive EP by transfer of the ATP γ-phosphate to the enzyme. Therefore, the E1Ca2conformation, as opposed to E2, can be functionally distinguished by a brief phosphorylation at 0 °C. Our initial EP measurements confirmed previously reported inhibitory effects of TG, namely the sensitivity of theE2 conformation to TG (6Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12606-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study reveals that the ATP phosphorylating capacity was dependent on Ca2+ concentration when equimolar TG was added toE1Ca2 (Figs. 2 and 3). These experiments required 1–2 s phosphorylation at 0 °C since longer phosphorylation times led to EP destabilization and the accumulation ofE2TG as the reaction cycle proceeded (6Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 10Sagara Y. Fernandez-Belda F. de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12606-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 2B). The inhibition degree was also dependent on incubation time and temperature (Fig. 3B). Higher Ca2+ concentrations were needed to observe a certainEP level when the incubation was prolonged from 5 min to 1 h and the temperature was raised from 25 to 37 °C. These data are consistent with intrinsic fluorescence measurements showing a faster TG-dependent signal under conditions favoring the accumulation of E2 species, i.e. low pH and high temperature (8Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments described in Figs. 2 and 3correspond to the transitions: E1Ca2+ TG → E1Ca2TG orE1Ca2 + TG →E1Ca2TG →E2TG + Ca2+ (see SchemeFSI). When E2 was preincubated with TG, the TG/enzyme molar ratio was <1 and 10 μm free Ca2+ was added, the enzyme capacity to be phosphorylated by ATP was related to the E1Ca2/E2ratio and the dependence of EP on TG provided a titration of the enzyme molecules. This explains why EP decreased monotonically as the TG concentration rose (Fig. 4). It also confirms that E2TG is an inactive form (6Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 8Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wictome M.

Chem. 1990; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 8Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wictome M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12606-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The slow kinetics of EP accumulation after addition of millimolar Ca2+ to E2TG even when the temperature was raised to 37 °C (Fig. 5) confirms the main inhibitory action of TG as a clear decrease in the rate of theE2 → E1Ca2transition. Therefore, when the incubation medium contains a low μm free Ca2+ and TG is added, the enzyme is blocked in the E2TG state. However, the addition of high Ca2+ enables the enzyme to recover from the apparent E2TG dead complex. Experiments in Fig.5 correspond to the transition E2TG + Ca2+ → E1Ca2TG in Scheme FSI. EP levels in Fig. 5 were measured after 1 s phosphorylation to avoid enzyme cycling. Note that 1 s phosphorylation provided lower EP levels than 2 s when TG was added to E1Ca2 (3 mm) (Fig. 2B). The fact that E2TG preincubated with millimolar Ca2+ can be fully phosphorylated by ATP may be due to TG dissociation from the enzyme. This was checked by using a gel filtration column to remove unbound TG and measuring Ca2+-ATPase activity. E2TG samples preincubated with 3 mm free Ca2+ orE1Ca2 (3 mm) preincubated with equimolar TG and then passed through Sephadex did not recover Ca2+-ATPase activity. A residual activity was noticed in both cases (Fig. 6). This result is proof that a high Ca2+ concentration is unable to induce TG dissociation. However, these preincubation conditions allowed full phosphorylation by ATP. This behavior is consistent with the partial reaction:E2TG + Ca2+ →E1Ca2TG and not with:E2TG + Ca2+ →E1Ca2 + TG. In other words, Ca2+ and TG can be forced to be simultaneously bound to the enzyme. A mutually exclusive model requires TG dissociation when the Ca2+ concentration is raised and this was not observed under any circumstance (Fig. 6). On the other hand, it is known that TG and Ca2+ have different binding sites (14Zhong L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12994-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). The recovery of enzyme activity after dilution (Fig. 7) demonstrates that TG can be dissociated from the enzyme and, therefore, that it is reversibly bound. The dissociation was observed after a 100-fold dilution when the protein concentration was lowered to 0.1 μg/ml and TG was 0.3 nm. The dissociation kinetics was very slow and required a long incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 7B). The high temperature was critical since no dissociation was observed when the incubation was performed at 25 °C even though similar conditions after dilution were used (10Sagara Y. Fernandez-Belda F. de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12606-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments in Fig. 7 correspond to the transition E2TG → E2 + TG → E1Ca2 in Scheme FSI. The hydrolysis of phosphorylating substrates in the absence of Ca2+ was unaffected by the presence of TG even when used above the equimolar level and was sustained by the purified enzyme (Fig. 8). This indicates that TG does not affect the catalytic properties of E2. The normal operation of the reaction cycle in a Ca2+-containing medium involves the participation of E1Ca2,E2, and phosphorylated species. When the reaction cycle takes place in the presence of Ca2+ and TG is also present, the enzyme is stacked as E2TG. Under these conditions the E2TG complex in the presence of Ca2+ exhibits the same hydrolytic activity as the enzyme in the absence of Ca2+ and TG. It should be recalled that the residual activity measured in the presence of Ca2+ coincided with that measured in the absence of Ca2+ when samples were pretreated with TG (Fig. 6). This confirms that the inhibitory effect of TG is on the Ca2+-dependent but not on the Ca2+-independent activity. Inhibition by TG has also been shown to be dependent on theE1Ca2/E2ratio when p-nitrophenyl phosphate was the substrate (27Fernandez-Belda F. Fortea M.I. Soler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7998-8004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Full phosphorylation by ATP in the presence of equimolar TG and millimolar Ca2+ was observed using leaky SR (Figs. 2 and 3) and was also reproduced in native vesicles (data not shown) indicating that Ca2+ binding to the external (high affinity) sites is sufficient to exert the protective effect. Saturation of the internal (low affinity) Ca2+ sites has also been reported to decrease the inhibitory effect of TG on enzyme phosphorylation from inorganic phosphate (10Sagara Y. Fernandez-Belda F. de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12606-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that, under equilibrium conditions, any action directed at decreasing the accumulation ofE2TG has a protective role. In contrast, we have checked that the Ca2+-dependent activity is inhibited by TG when millimolar Ca2+ is present in the external and/or internal medium. This confirms that Ca2+ binding to the cytoplasmic or lumenal sites does not provide protection when the enzyme is cycling. The interaction of TG and Ca2+ with the enzyme in the absence of ATP is summarized in Scheme FSI. The binding of TG is not dependent on the conformational state of the enzyme and thereforeE1Ca2 and E2are targets for TG. The stabilization ofE1Ca2TG orE2TG under equilibrium conditions is dependent on the Ca2+ concentration present. This study demonstrates that the equilibria among the Ca2+-dependent conformations of the enzyme in the presence of TG can be shifted by ligand addition and/or sample dilution."
