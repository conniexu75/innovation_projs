https://openalex.org/W3018541302,"The role of non-neuronal cells in Alzheimer's disease progression has not been fully elucidated. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we identified a population of disease-associated astrocytes in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. These disease-associated astrocytes appeared at early disease stages and increased in abundance with disease progression. We discovered that similar astrocytes appeared in aged wild-type mice and in aging human brains, suggesting their linkage to genetic and age-related factors."

https://openalex.org/W3020538763,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) has an enormous impact on global disease burden, affecting millions of people worldwide and ranking as a leading cause of disability for almost three decades. Past molecular studies of MDD employed bulk homogenates of postmortem brain tissue, which obscures gene expression changes within individual cell types. Here we used single-nucleus transcriptomics to examine ~80,000 nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of male individuals with MDD (n = 17) and of healthy controls (n = 17). We identified 26 cellular clusters, and over 60% of these showed differential gene expression between groups. We found that the greatest dysregulation occurred in deep layer excitatory neurons and immature oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and these contributed almost half (47%) of all changes in gene expression. These results highlight the importance of dissecting cell-type-specific contributions to the disease and offer opportunities to identify new avenues of research and novel targets for treatment. Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal brain alterations associated with major depression. Deep layer excitatory cells and immature oligodendrocytes showed most changes, involving synaptic plasticity, immune function and steroid hormones."
https://openalex.org/W3020331344,"CD4+ T cells are critical to fighting pathogens, but a comprehensive analysis of human T-cell specificities is hindered by the diversity of HLA alleles (>20,000) and the complexity of many pathogen genomes. We previously described GLIPH, an algorithm to cluster T-cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize the same epitope and to predict their HLA restriction, but this method loses efficiency and accuracy when >10,000 TCRs are analyzed. Here we describe an improved algorithm, GLIPH2, that can process millions of TCR sequences. We used GLIPH2 to analyze 19,044 unique TCRβ sequences from 58 individuals latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and to group them according to their specificity. To identify the epitopes targeted by clusters of Mtb-specific T cells, we carried out a screen of 3,724 distinct proteins covering 95% of Mtb protein-coding genes using artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) and reporter T cells. We found that at least five PPE (Pro-Pro-Glu) proteins are targets for T-cell recognition in Mtb."
https://openalex.org/W3019747475,"Genome-wide association studies have discovered hundreds of loci associated with complex brain disorders, but it remains unclear in which cell types these loci are active. Here we integrate genome-wide association study results with single-cell transcriptomic data from the entire mouse nervous system to systematically identify cell types underlying brain complex traits. We show that psychiatric disorders are predominantly associated with projecting excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Neurological diseases were associated with different cell types, which is consistent with other lines of evidence. Notably, Parkinson's disease was genetically associated not only with cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons (which include dopaminergic neurons) but also with enteric neurons and oligodendrocytes. Using post-mortem brain transcriptomic data, we confirmed alterations in these cells, even at the earliest stages of disease progression. Our study provides an important framework for understanding the cellular basis of complex brain maladies, and reveals an unexpected role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W3017825580,"Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) typically arise in the central nervous system (CNS) of children under 3 years of age. Despite intensive multimodal therapy (surgery, chemotherapy and, if age permits, radiotherapy), median survival is 17 months1,2. We show that ATRTs robustly express B7-H3/CD276 that does not result from the inactivating mutations in SMARCB1 (refs. 3,4), which drive oncogenesis in ATRT, but requires residual SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) activity mediated by BRG1/SMARCA4. Consistent with the embryonic origin of ATRT5,6, B7-H3 is highly expressed on the prenatal, but not postnatal, brain. B7-H3.BB.z-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells administered intracerebroventricularly or intratumorally mediate potent antitumor effects against cerebral ATRT xenografts in mice, with faster kinetics, greater potency and reduced systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines compared to CAR T cells administered intravenously. CAR T cells administered ICV also traffic from the CNS into the periphery; following clearance of ATRT xenografts, B7-H3.BB.z-CAR T cells administered intracerebroventricularly or intravenously mediate antigen-specific protection from tumor rechallenge, both in the brain and periphery. These results identify B7-H3 as a compelling therapeutic target for this largely incurable pediatric tumor and demonstrate important advantages of locoregional compared to systemic delivery of CAR T cells for the treatment of CNS malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W3019716997,"Cytoplasmic dynein-1 is a molecular motor that drives nearly all minus-end-directed microtubule-based transport in human cells, performing functions that range from retrograde axonal transport to mitotic spindle assembly1,2. Activated dynein complexes consist of one or two dynein dimers, the dynactin complex and an 'activating adaptor', and they show faster velocity when two dynein dimers are present3-6. Little is known about the assembly process of this massive ~4 MDa complex. Here, using purified recombinant human proteins, we uncover a role for the dynein-binding protein LIS1 in promoting the formation of activated dynein-dynactin complexes that contain two dynein dimers. Complexes activated by proteins representing three families of activating adaptors-BicD2, Hook3 and Ninl-all show enhanced motile properties in the presence of LIS1. Activated dynein complexes do not require sustained LIS1 binding for fast velocity. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that human LIS1 binds to dynein at two sites on the motor domain of dynein. Our research suggests that LIS1 binding at these sites functions in multiple stages of assembling the motile dynein-dynactin-activating adaptor complex."

We engineered tobacco plants with a fungal bioluminescence system that converts caffeic acid (present in all plants) into luciferin and report self-sustained luminescence that is visible to the naked eye. Our findings could underpin development of a suite of imaging tools for plants. Luminescence is engineered in whole plants, without an exogenous substrate, using a fungal gene cluster."
https://openalex.org/W3020078931,"Lissencephaly-1 (Lis1) is a key cofactor for dynein-mediated intracellular transport towards the minus-ends of microtubules. It remains unclear whether Lis1 serves as an inhibitor or an activator of mammalian dynein motility. Here we use single-molecule imaging and optical trapping to show that Lis1 does not directly alter the stepping and force production of individual dynein motors assembled with dynactin and a cargo adaptor. Instead, Lis1 promotes the formation of an active complex with dynactin. Lis1 also favours the recruitment of two dyneins to dynactin, resulting in increased velocity, higher force production and more effective competition against kinesin in a tug-of-war. Lis1 dissociates from motile complexes, indicating that its primary role is to orchestrate the assembly of the transport machinery. We propose that Lis1 binding releases dynein from its autoinhibited state, which provides a mechanistic explanation for why Lis1 is required for efficient transport of many dynein-associated cargos in cells. Lis1 regulates dynein activity. Three independent but complementary studies by the laboratories of Markus, Reck-Peterson and Yildiz identify a key role for Lis1 in modulating localization, activity and function of dynein in cells."

https://openalex.org/W3020176739,"Dynein is a microtubule motor that transports many different cargos in various cell types and contexts. How dynein is regulated to perform these activities with spatial and temporal precision remains unclear. Human dynein is regulated by autoinhibition, whereby intermolecular contacts limit motor activity. Whether this mechanism is conserved throughout evolution, whether it can be affected by extrinsic factors, and its role in regulating dynein function remain unclear. Here, we use a combination of negative stain electron microscopy, single-molecule assays, genetic, and cell biological techniques to show that autoinhibition is conserved in budding yeast, and plays a key role in coordinating in vivo dynein function. Moreover, we find that the Lissencephaly-related protein, LIS1 (Pac1 in yeast), plays an important role in regulating dynein autoinhibition. Our studies demonstrate that, rather than inhibiting dynein motility, Pac1/LIS1 promotes dynein activity by stabilizing the uninhibited conformation, which ensures appropriate dynein localization and activity in cells."

https://openalex.org/W3017541193,"Soil physicochemical properties, bacterial communities and enzyme activities change with land subsidence resulting from coal mining. However, research on the responses of bacterial communities and enzyme activities to the soil properties in different degree of subsidence areas is limited. As such, we collected soil samples from a control area (C area), a moderate mining subsidence area (M area) and a severe mining subsidence area (S area) in Central China. Soil properties, such as the pH, total nitrogen (TN) content, total phosphorus (TP) content, available phosphorus (AP) content, organic matter (OM) content, and soil enzyme (urease, invertase, catalase and alkaline phosphatase) activities were measured in each sampling area at depths of 0–20 cm, 20–40 cm, and 40–60 cm. The results indicated that the soil physiochemical properties, soil urease activity, soil alkaline phosphatase activity and soil bacterial richness and diversity in the topsoil (0–20 cm) of the mining subsidence area were significantly lower than those in the C area. However, the soil enzyme activities within the deepest layer of the subsidence area were significantly greater than those of the C area. The bacterial communities within the depth of 0–20 cm were dominated by RB41, Pseudomonas, MND1, Nitrospira, Trichococcus, Sphingomonas and Dongia, whereas RB41 and Pseudomonas were the dominant species in the C area and subsidence area, respectively. Using correlation analysis, we found that the soil pH value, soil AP content and activities of the four enzymes were the main factors affecting the soil bacterial community structure. In addition, the soil nutrient contents, enzyme activities and bacterial richness and evenness decreased with increasing subsidence degree (classified by geological hazards, groundwater and landscape damage degree of coal mining subsidence). These results provide a reliable basis for environmental management of mining areas."
https://openalex.org/W3019539163,"Aim Metabolic reprograming is crucial in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Canagliflozin (CANA), a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, affects various metabolisms. We investigated the effects of CANA on proliferation and metabolic reprograming of HCC cell lines using multi-omics analysis of metabolomics and absolute quantification proteomics (iMPAQT). Methods The cells were counted 72 hours after treatment with CANA (10 μM; n = 5) or dimethyl sulfoxide (control [CON]; n = 5) in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. In Hep3B cells, metabolomics and iMPAQT were used to evaluate the levels of metabolites and metabolic enzymes in the CANA and CON groups (each n = 5) 48 hours after treatment. Results Seventy-two hours after treatment, the number of cells in the CANA group was significantly decreased compared to that in the CON group in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. On multi-omics analysis, there was a significant difference in the levels of 85 metabolites and 68 metabolic enzymes between the CANA and CON groups. For instance, CANA significantly downregulated ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha, a mitochondrial electron transport system protein (CON 297.28±20.63 vs. CANA 251.83±22.83 fmol/10 μg protein; P = 0.0183). CANA also significantly upregulated 3-hydroxybutyrate, a beta-oxidation metabolite (CON 530±14 vs. CANA 854±68 arbitrary units; P<0.001). Moreover, CANA significantly downregulated nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 (CON 110.30±11.37 vs. CANA 89.14±8.39 fmol/10 μg protein; P = 0.0172). Conclusions We found that CANA suppressed the proliferation of HCC cells through alterations in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism. Thus, CANA may suppress the proliferation of HCC by regulating metabolic reprograming."
https://openalex.org/W3019689148,"Increased genetic gain for complex traits in plant breeding programs can be achieved through different selection strategies. The objective of this study was to compare potential gains for grain yield in a winter wheat breeding program through estimating response to selection R values across several selection approaches including phenotypic (PS), marker-based (MS), genomic (GS), and a combination of PS and GS (PS+GS). Ten populations of Washington State University (WSU) winter wheat breeding lines including a diversity panel and F5 and double haploid lines evaluated from 2015 to 2019 growing seasons for grain yield in Lind and Pullman, WA, USA were used in the study. Selection was conducted by selecting the top 20% of lines based on observed yield (PS strategy), genomic estimated breeding values (GS), presence of yield ""enhancing"" alleles of the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers identified from genome-wide association mapping (MS), and high observed yield and estimated breeding values (PS+GS). Overall, PS compared to other individual selection strategies (MS and GS) showed the highest mean response (R = 0.61) within the same environment. When combined with GS, a 23% improvement in R for yield was observed, indicating that gains could be improved by complementing traditional PS with GS within the same environment. Validating selection strategies in different environments resulted in low to negative R values indicating the effects of genotype-by-environment interactions for grain yield. MS was not successful in terms of R relative to the other selection approaches; using this strategy resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in response to selection compared with the other approaches. An integrated PS+GS approach could result in optimal genetic gain within the same environment, whereas a PS strategy might be a viable option for grain yield validated in different environments. Altogether, we demonstrated that gains through increased response to selection for yield could be achieved in the WSU winter wheat breeding program by implementing different selection strategies either exclusively or in combination."
https://openalex.org/W3020395804,"Prolonged serum half-life is required for the efficacy of most protein therapeutics. One strategy for half-life extension is to exploit the long circulating half-life of serum albumin by incorporating a binding moiety that recognizes albumin. Here, we describe camelid single-domain antibodies (VHHs) that bind the serum albumins of multiple species with moderate to high affinity at both neutral and endosomal pH and significantly extend the serum half-lives of multiple proteins in rats from minutes to days. We serendipitously identified an additional VHH (M75) that is naturally pH-sensitive: at endosomal pH, binding affinity for human serum albumin (HSA) was dramatically weakened and binding to rat serum albumin (RSA) was undetectable. Domain mapping revealed that M75 bound to HSA domain 1 and 2. Moreover, alanine scanning of HSA His residues suggested a critical role for His247, located in HSA domain 2, in M75 binding and its pH dependence. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were suggestive of proton-linked binding of M75 to HSA, with differing binding enthalpies observed for full-length HSA and an HSA domain 1-domain 2 fusion protein in which surface-exposed His residues were substituted with Ala. M75 conferred moderate half-life extension in rats, from minutes to hours, likely due to rapid dissociation from RSA during FcRn-mediated endosomal recycling in tandem with albumin conformational changes induced by M75 binding that prevented interaction with FcRn. Humanized VHHs maintained in vivo half-life extension capabilities. These VHHs represent a new set of tools for extending protein therapeutic half-life and one (M75) demonstrates a unique pH-sensitive binding interaction that can be exploited to achieve modest in vivo half-life."
https://openalex.org/W3018489821,"The ability to distinguish between different migratory behaviours (e.g., anadromy and potamodromy) in fish can provide important insights into the ecology, evolution, and conservation of many aquatic species. We present a simple stable carbon isotope (δ13C) approach for distinguishing between sockeye (anadromous ocean migrants) and kokanee (potamodromous freshwater residents), two migratory ecotypes of Oncorhynchus nerka (Salmonidae) that is applicable throughout most of their range across coastal regions of the North Pacific Ocean. Analyses of kokanee (n = 239) and sockeye (n = 417) from 87 sites spanning the North Pacific (Russia to California) show that anadromous and potamodromous ecotypes are broadly distinguishable on the basis of the δ13C values of their scale and bone collagen. We present three case studies demonstrating how this approach can address questions in archaeology, archival, and conservation research. Relative to conventional methods for determining migratory status, which typically apply chemical analyses to otoliths or involve genetic analyses of tissues, the δ13C approach outlined here has the benefit of being non-lethal (when applied to scales), cost-effective, widely available commercially, and should be much more broadly accessible for addressing archaeological questions since the recovery of otoliths at archaeological sites is rare."

https://openalex.org/W3019698519,"The Amazon region is rich in genetic resources such as oilseeds which have potentially important local commercial exploitation. Despite its high concentration of bioactive compounds, cacay (Caryodendron orinocense Karst.) oil is poorly investigated and explored. Thus, this study focuses on the physicochemical characterization (moisture, density, and saponification, iodine, and acidity values), fatty acid composition as determined by gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC/MS), total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant activity (DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assay) of cacay oil, coconut oil and a coconut/cacay oil blend, also known as cacay butter. The antibacterial activity of cacay oil was additionally evaluated. Our study demonstrated that cacay oil presents a high amount of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (58.3%) with an emphasis on linoleic acid and a lower acidity value (2.67 ± 0.01 cg I2/g) than butter and coconut oil, indicating a low concentration of free fatty acids. In contrast, cacay butter and coconut oil presented higher saturated fatty acid percentages (69.1% and 78.4%, respectively) and higher saponification values (242.78 and 252.22 mg KOH/g, respectively). The samples showed low moisture and relative density between 912 and 916 kg/m3. The hydrophilic fraction of cacay oil was highlighted in the quantification of TPC (326.27 ± 6.79 mg GAE/kg) and antioxidant capacity in vitro by DPPH radical scavenging assay (156.57 ± 2.25 μmol TE/g). Cacay oil inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus (44.99 ± 7.68%), Enterococcus faecalis (27.76 ± 0.00%), and Staphylococcus aureus (11.81 ± 3.75%). At long last, this is the first study reporting the physicochemical characterization and bioactive properties of cacay butter. Coconut oil and cacay butter showed great oxidative stability potential due to higher contents of saturated fatty acids. Moreover, cacay oil presents as an alternative source of raw materials for cosmetic and biotechnology industries due to its high concentration of PUFA and for being a rich source of phenolic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W3019787541,"Understanding the mitotic DNA damage response (DDR) is critical to our comprehension of cancer, premature aging and developmental disorders which are marked by DNA repair deficiencies. In this study we use a micro-focused laser to induce DNA damage in selected mitotic chromosomes to study the subsequent repair response. Our findings demonstrate that (1) mitotic cells are capable of DNA repair as evidenced by DNA synthesis at damage sites, (2) Repair is attenuated when DNA-PKcs and ATM are simultaneously compromised, (3) Laser damage may permit the observation of previously undetected DDR proteins when damage is elicited by other methods in mitosis, and (4) Twenty five percent of mitotic DNA-damaged cells undergo a subsequent mitosis. Together these findings suggest that mitotic DDR is more complex than previously thought and may involve factors from multiple repair pathways that are better understood in interphase."
https://openalex.org/W3019741300,"Understanding the immune responses against Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is important to prevent infection and to design control strategies. We evaluated both systemic and mucosal immune responses to PEDV in pigs and assessed if prior exposure to virus protects against re-infection. Three-week-old pigs were infected with PEDV and immune response in blood, intestine, and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) was evaluated. At 30 dpi, virus exposed pigs were challenged with a field isolate of PEDV and immune response at 5 d post challenge was evaluated. We found that PEDV RNA persists in the intestine even after fecal shedding of the virus was stopped at 28 dpi and pigs previously exposed to PEDV are protected from virus shedding after re-infection. PEDV infection induced both humoral and cell mediated immune response with an increase in PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibodies in intestine and serum. Flow cytometry analysis showed a significantly higher frequency of B cells and lower frequency of T cells at 4 dpi. The frequency of CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) memory T cells was significantly increased in the MLN of challenged animals. These studies may provide further insights into understanding the mucosal immune response to PEDV and its role in protection against disease."
https://openalex.org/W3017677109,"Plasmodium falciparum causes the most lethal form of malaria. The cooperation of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 and 90 is thought to facilitate folding of select group of cellular proteins that are crucial for cyto-protection and development of the parasites. Hsp70 and Hsp90 are brought into a functional complex that allows substrate exchange by stress inducible protein 1 (STI1), also known as Hsp70-Hsp90 organising protein (Hop). P. falciparum Hop (PfHop) co-localises and occurs in complex with the parasite cytosolic chaperones, PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp90. Here, we characterised the structure of recombinant PfHop using synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) and small-angle X-ray scattering. Structurally, PfHop is a monomeric, elongated but folded protein, in agreement with its predicted TPR domain structure. Using SRCD, we established that PfHop is unstable at temperatures higher than 40°C. This suggests that PfHop is less stable at elevated temperatures compared to its functional partner, PfHsp70-1, that is reportedly stable at temperatures as high as 80°C. These findings contribute towards our understanding of the role of the Hop-mediated functional partnership between Hsp70 and Hsp90."
https://openalex.org/W3020188465,"Background The Global Gag Rule (GGR), reinstated by President Trump in January 2017, makes non-U.S. non-governmental organizations ineligible for U.S. foreign assistance if they provide access to or information about abortion. While evidence suggests previous iterations of the GGR negatively impacted sexual and reproductive health outcomes, no studies have quantitatively assessed the impacts of the Trump administration’s GGR. Methods We constructed a panel dataset of facilities (76% public) using 2017/2018 Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 service delivery point (SDP) surveys in Uganda. Based on information from stakeholder meetings, we classified districts as more or less exposed to the GGR; 45% (N = 34) of study districts were classified as “more exposed”, which corresponded to 145 “more exposed” and 142 “less exposed” health facilities in our sample. We assessed changes in provision of long-acting reversible contraceptives, contraceptive stock-outs, mobile outreach services, engagement with community health workers (CHWs), service integration, and quality of care from 2017 (pre-GGR) to 2018 (post-GGR). Multivariable regression models were estimated, and difference-in-differences impact estimators were determined by calculating predicted probabilities from interaction terms for exposure and survey round. Findings We observed no immediate impact of the GGR on the provision of long-acting reversible contraceptives, contraceptive stock-outs, mobile outreach services, service integration, or quality of care. We did observe a significant impact of the policy on the average number of CHWs, with “more exposed” facilities engaging 3.8 fewer CHWs post-GGR (95% CI:-7.31,-0.32). Conclusions The reduction in CHWs could reduce contraceptive use and increase unintended pregnancies in Uganda. The lack of other significant findings may not be surprising given the short post-GGR observation window. Rapid organizational responses and stopgap funding from foreign governments may have mitigated any immediate impacts on service delivery in the short term. The true impact may not be felt for many years, as stopgap funding potentially ebbs and service providers adapt to new funding environments."

Measles and comorbidities were defined by International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or ICD-10-CM codes. Multivariable survey logistic regression and linear regression models controlling for sociodemographic demographic factors were constructed to understand associations with organ-specific complications, and cost of care and length of stay, respectively.Overall, 1,018 measles hospitalizations occurred in 2002-2016, and hospitalizations increased over time. In multivariable logistic regression models, measles was associated with higher odds of gastrointestinal, hematologic, infectious, neurologic, ophthalmologic, pulmonary, and renal complications, with the strongest association observed with encephalitis (39.84 [16.51-96.12], P<0.0001). Increased length of stay (LOS) and similar cost of care (mean [95% CI]; 4.8 [4.4-5.4]; $7,438 [$6,446-$8,582]) were observed versus (vs.) all other admissions (4.5 [4.4-4.5]; P<0.01; $7,854 [$7,774-$7,935], P>0.05).

https://openalex.org/W3017988893,"Insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) is a Th-2, IgE-mediated dermatitis of horses caused by bites of insects of the genus Culicoides that has common features with human atopic dermatitis. Together with Th-2 cells, the epithelial barrier plays an important role in development of type I hypersensitivities. In order to elucidate the role of the epithelial barrier and of the skin immune response in IBH we studied the transcriptome of lesional whole skin of IBH-horses (IBH-LE; n = 9) in comparison to non-lesional skin (IBH-NL; n = 8) as well as to skin of healthy control horses (H; n = 9). To study the ""baseline state"" of the epithelial barrier, we investigated the transcriptome of non-lesional epidermis in IBH-horses (EPI-IBH-NL; n = 10) in comparison with healthy epidermis from controls (EPI-H; n = 9). IBH-LE skin displayed substantial transcriptomic difference compared to H. IBH-LE was characterized by a downregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation, alterations in keratins and substantial immune signature of both Th-1 and Th-2 types with particular upregulation of IL13, as well as involvement of the hypoxic pathway. IBH-NL shared a number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with IBH-LE, but was overall more similar to H skin. In the epidermis, genes involved in metabolism of epidermal lipids, pruritus development, as well as IL25, were significantly differentially expressed between EPI-IBH-NL and EPI-H. Taken together, our data suggests an impairment of the epithelial barrier in IBH-affected horses that may act as a predisposing factor for IBH development. Moreover, these new mechanisms could potentially be used as future therapeutic targets. Importantly, many transcriptional features of equine IBH skin are shared with human atopic dermatitis, confirming equine IBH as a natural model of skin allergy."

Phenomenological analysis was applied in this qualitative study. The patients diagnosed with lower limb varicose veins and undergoing elective surgery who showed non-compliance with GECS as the treatment were invited to have semi-structured, in-depth, face-to-face interviews. Colaizzi method was employed to analyze the data for emerging themes associated with the reasons for patients' non-compliance. Four main themes and nine subthemes related to the reasons for non-compliance with GECS for lower limb varicose veins were summarized. The main themes that emerged were (1) gaps in the knowledge of GECS therapy as a treatment for lower limb varicose veins, (2) few recommendations from the doctors and nurses, (3) disadvantages of GECS, and (4) sociopsychological factors. These themes provide data for policy and planning to improve patients' compliance with GECS in China.

https://openalex.org/W3018334732,"Perennial habit and floral scent are major traits that distinguish domesticated cowpeas from their wild relatives. However, the genetic basis of these two important traits remains largely unknown in cowpea. Plant longevity, a perenniality-related trait, and floral scent, an outcrossing trait, were investigated using a RIL population derived from a cross between a domesticated and a wild cowpea. QTL analysis revealed three significant loci, one on chromosome 8 associated with plant longevity and two, on chromosomes 1 and 11, for floral scent. Genes within the QTL regions were identified. Genes encoding an F-box protein (Vigun08g215300) and two kinases (Vigun08g217000, Vigun08g217800), and involved in physiological processes including regulation of flowering time and plant longevity, were identified within the perenniality QTL region. A cluster of O-methyltransferase genes (Vigun11g096800, Vigun11g096900, Vigun11g097000, Vigun11g097600, and Vigun11g097800) was identified within the floral scent QTL region. These O-methyltransferase cowpea genes are orthologs of the Arabidopsis N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) gene, which is involved in the biosynthesis of melatonin. Melatonin is an indole derivative, which is an essential molecule for plant interactions with pollinators. These findings lay the foundation for further exploration of the genetic mechanisms of perenniality and floral scent in cowpea.

However, many people’s hepatitis B virus (HBV) status remains unknown. Objective 1. To maximise the utility of existing HBV test and vaccination data in the NT by creating a linked dataset and computerised algorithmic coding. 2. To undertake rigorous quality assurance processes to establish feasibility of using the linked dataset and computerised algorithmic coding for individual care for people living with CHB. Methods Step 1: We used deterministic data linkage to merge information from three separate patient databases. HBV testing and vaccination data from 2008–2016 was linked and extracted for 19,314 people from 21 remote Aboriginal communities in the Top End of the NT. Step 2: A computerised algorithm was developed to allocate one of ten HBV codes to each individual. Step 3: A quality assurance process was undertaken by a clinician, using standardised processes, manually reviewing all three databases, for a subset of 5,293 Aboriginal people from five communities to check the accuracy of each allocated code. Results The process of data linking individuals was highly accurate at 99.9%. The quality assurance process detected an overall error rate of 17.7% on the HBV code generated by the computerised algorithm. Errors occurred in source documentation, primarily from the historical upload of paper-based records to electronic health records. An overall HBV prevalence of 2.6% in five communities was found, which included ten cases of CHB who were previously unaware of infection and not engaged in care. Conclusions Data linkage of individuals was highly accurate. Data quality issues and poor sensitivity in the codes produced by the computerised algorithm were uncovered in the quality assurance process. By systematically, manually reviewing all available data we were able to allocate a HBV status to 91% of the study population."
https://openalex.org/W3019929805,"The introduction of exotic disease vectors into a new habitat can drastically change the local epidemiological situation. During 2012-2015, larvae and an adult of the yellow-fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, were captured alive at two international airports serving the Greater Tokyo Area, Japan. Because this species does not naturally distribute in this country, those mosquitoes were considered to be introduced from overseas via air-transportation. To infer the places of origin of those mosquitoes, we genotyped the 12 microsatellite loci for which the most comprehensive population genetic reference is currently available. Although clustering by Bayesian and multivariate methods both suggested that all those mosquitoes captured at the airports in Japan belonged to the Asia/Pacific populations, they were not clustered into a single cluster. Moreover, there was variation in mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (CoxI) haplotypes among mosquitoes collected in different incidents of discovery which indicated the existence of multiple maternal origins. We conclude there is little evidence to support the overwintering of Ae. aegypti at the airports; nevertheless, special attention is still needed to prevent the invasion of this prominent arbovirus vector."
https://openalex.org/W3017927216,"Myosin XXI (Myo21) is a novel class of myosin present in all kinetoplastid parasites, such as Trypanosoma and Leishmania. This protein in Leishmania promastigotes is predominantly localized to the proximal region of the flagellum, and is involved in the flagellum assembly, cell motility and intracellular vesicle transport. As Myo21 contains two ubiquitin associated (UBA)-like domains (UBLD) in its amino acid sequence, we considered it of interest to analyze the role of these domains in the intracellular distribution and functions of this protein in Leishmania cells. In this context, we created green fluorescent protein (GFP)-conjugates of Myo21 constructs lacking one of the two UBLDs at a time or both the UBLDs as well as GFP-conjugates of only the two UBLDs and Myo21 tail lacking the two UBLDs and separately expressed them in the Leishmania cells. Our results show that unlike Myo21-GFP, Myo21-GFP constructs lacking either one or both the UBLDs failed to concentrate and co-distribute with actin in the proximal region of the flagellum. Nevertheless, the GFP conjugate of only the two UBLDs was found to predominantly localize to the flagellum base. Additionally, the cells that expressed only one or both the UBLDs-deleted Myo21-GFP constructs possessed shorter flagellum and displayed slower motility, compared to Myo21-GFP expressing cells. Further, the intracellular vesicle transport and cell growth were severely impaired in the cells that expressed both the UBLDs deleted Myo21-GFP construct, but in contrast, virtually no effect was observed on the intracellular vesicle transport and growth in the cells that expressed single UBLD deleted mutant proteins. Moreover, the observed slower growth of both the UBLDs-deleted Myo21-GFP expressing cells was primarily due to delayed G2/M phase caused by aberrant nuclear and daughter cell segregation during their cell division process. These results taken together clearly reveal that the presence of UBLDs in Myo21 are essentially required for its predominant localization to the flagellum base, and perhaps also in its involvement in the flagellum assembly and cell division. Possible role of UBLDs in involvement of Myo21 during Leishmania flagellum assembly and cell cycle is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3020186011,"Cementum is a bone connective tissue that provides a flexible attachment for the tooth to the alveolar bone in many mammalian species. It does not undergo continuous remodelling, unlike non-dental bone, which combined with its growth pattern of seasonal layering makes this tissue uniquely suitable as a proxy for tracking changes in body repair investment throughout an animal´s life. We tested functional and sexual selection hypotheses on the rate of cementum deposition related to the highly polygynous mating strategy of red deer. We used a sample of 156 first lower molars from wild Scottish red deer of known age between 1 and 17 years old, approximately balanced by sex and age class. Cementum deposition on the inter-radicular pad increased with age at a constant average rate of 0.26 mm per year, with no significant differences between sexes. Cementum deposition was independent of (i) tooth wear, other than that associated with age, and (ii) enamel and dentine micro-hardness. The results partially supported the hypothesis that the main function of cementum is the repositioning of the tooth to maintain opposing teeth in occlusion. However, teeth that had more wear or males´ teeth that had faster rates of tooth wear than those of females did not present the expected higher rates of cementum deposition."

Ninety-two male elite German junior field players were tested for height, mass, fat, and fat-free mass as well as aerobic endurance, squat (SJ) and counter movement jump (CMJ), linear sprint, core strength-endurance, and one repetition maximum (1RM) bench press performance. According to their age and competitive match playing times, the players were divided into the mentioned different groups. Magnitude-based inferences and effect sizes (ES) were computed for statistical analyses. The fat-free mass, SJ and CMJ, 1RM bench press, and linear sprinting performances increased likely to most likely from U17 to U21 players (ES: moderate to large), whereas the body fat, core strength-endurance, and aerobic endurance performances remain constant. The fat-free mass, 1RM bench press, and linear sprinting performances were likely to most likely higher in U21 starting compared to nonstarting players (ES: moderate to large). Our study shows that contrary to endurance, power associated capacities differ between different aged and starting-nonstarting elite junior soccer players. This outcome should be considered for training, testing, and talent selection procedures in elite junior soccer players."
https://openalex.org/W3019088716,"Lamin C2 (LMN C2) is a short product of the lamin a gene. It is a germ cell-specific lamin and has been extensively studied in male germ cells. In this study, we focussed on the expression and localization of LMN C2 in fully-grown germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes. We detected LMN C2 in the fully-grown germinal vesicle oocytes of various mammalian species with confirmation done by immunoblotting the wild type and Lmnc2 gene deleted testes. Expression of LMN C2 tagged with GFP showed localization of LMN C2 to the nuclear membrane of the oocyte. Moreover, the LMN C2 protein notably disappeared after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and the expression of LMN C2 was significantly reduced in the oocytes from aged females and ceased altogether during meiotic maturation. These results provide new insights regarding LMN C2 expression in the oocytes of various mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W3020025754,"The NUP98 and NUP214 nucleoporins (NUPs) are recurrently fused to heterologous proteins in leukemia. The resulting chimeric oncoproteins retain the phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat motifs of the NUP moiety that mediate interaction with the nuclear export receptor Crm1. NUP fusion leukemias are characterized by HOXA gene upregulation; however, their molecular pathogenesis remains poorly understood. To investigate the role of Crm1 in mediating the leukemogenic properties of NUP chimeric proteins, we took advantage of the Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1)-NUP214 fusion. SQSTM1-NUP214 retains only a short C-terminal portion of NUP214 which contains FG motifs that mediate interaction with Crm1. We introduced point mutations targeting these FG motifs and found that the ability of the resulting SQSTM1-NUP214FGmut protein to interact with Crm1 was reduced by more than 50% compared with SQSTM1-NUP214. Mutation of FG motifs affected transforming potential: while SQSTM1-NUP214 impaired myeloid maturation and conferred robust colony formation to transduced hematopoietic progenitors in a serial replating assay, the effect of SQSTM1-NUP214FGmut was considerably diminished. Moreover, SQSTM1-NUP214 caused myeloid leukemia in all transplanted mice, whereas none of the SQSTM1-NUP214FGmut reconstituted mice developed leukemia. These oncogenic effects coincided with the ability of SQSTM1-NUP214 and SQSTM1-NUP214FGmut to upregulate the expression of Hoxa and Meis1 genes in hematopoietic progenitors. Indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that impaired SQSTM1-NUP214 interaction with Crm1 correlated with impaired binding of the fusion protein to Hoxa and Meis1 genes. These findings highlight the importance of Crm1 in mediating the leukemogenic properties of SQSTM1-NUP214, and suggest a conserved role of Crm1 in recruiting oncoproteins to their effector genes."
https://openalex.org/W3018148641,"To assess prevalence, clinical presentation and multimodal imaging characteristics of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in a hospital-based setting in South India.Electronic medical records (EMR) of new patients presenting with suspected clinical signs of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a tertiary hospital from January to December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed using keywords and filtered for patient who underwent multimodal imaging. Clinical presentations were categorized into predominantly hemorrhagic, exudative or mixed pattern. The imaging features were compared in these clinical groups. The multimodal images were graded by two masked graders and discrepancies between them were settled by a senior arbitrator.Of the 147 clinically suspicious cases of PCV out of 785 patients with clinical presentation of AMD as recorded in the EMR, 73 (49.7%) patients had a multimodal imaging diagnosis of PCV. There was no difference in the demography, distribution of polyps, ICGA and OCT characteristics in eyes presenting with hemorrhagic, exudative or mixed clinical features.Approximately half of South Asian patients presenting with clinical features of neovascular AMD harbor PCV irrespective of their clinical presentation and so we recommend that multimodal imaging is done in all cases of suspicious neovascular AMD in Indian population."
https://openalex.org/W3018282964,"Aerospace manufacturing industry is predicted to continue growing. Rising demand is triggering the current global aerospace ecosystem to evolve and adapt to challenges never faced before. New players into the aerospace manufacturing industry and the development of new ecosystems are evidencing its evolution. Understanding how the aerospace ecosystem has evolved is thus essential to prepare optimal conditions to nurture its growth. Recent studies have successfully combined economics and network science methods to map, analyse and predict the evolution of industrial ecosystems. In comparison to previous studies which apply network science-based methodologies to macro-economic research, this paper uses these methods to analyse the evolution of a particular industrial ecosystem, namely the aerospace sector. In particular, we develop bipartite country-product networks based on trade data over 25 years, to identify patterns and similarities in the evolution of developed aerospace manufacturing countries ecosystems. The analysis is elaborated at a macroscopic (network) and microscopic (nodes) levels. Motivated by studies in ecological networks, we use nestedness analysis to find patterns depicting the distribution and evolution of exported products across ecosystems. Our analysis reveals that developed ecosystems tend to become more analogous, as countries lean towards having a revealed comparative advantage (RCA) in the same group of products. Countries also tend to become more nested in their aerospace product space as they start developing a higher RCA. It is revealed that although countries develop an advantage on unique products, they also tend to increase competition with each other. Further analysis shows that manufactured products have a stronger correlation to an aerospace ecosystem than primary products; and in particular, the automotive sector shows the highest correlation with positive aerospace sector evolution. Competition between countries with well-developed aerospace ecosystems tends to centre on automotive parts, general industrial machinery, power generating machinery and equipment, and chemical materials and products."
https://openalex.org/W3018569748,"Potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli Sulc)-transmitted ""Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum"" (Lso) has been negatively impacting the potato industry in the United States as well as other potato-producing countries. Lso has been linked to a condition known as zebra chip (ZC) that affects yield and quality of potato tubers. Efforts to find sources of resistance to ZC have primarily focused on greenhouse evaluations based on a single inoculation time prior to harvest. Plant response to infection, however, could be influenced by the developmental stage of the host plant, and ZC may continue to develop after harvest. The objectives of this study were to quantify Lso inoculation success, Lso titer, ZC severity and Lso development during storage in eight potato genotypes. These evaluations were conducted on plants infested with Lso-positive psyllids at 77, 12, and 4 days before vine removal (DBVR). The evaluated genotypes were categorized according to their relative resistance to Lso and tolerance to ZC symptoms. Lso inoculation success in the genotype family A07781, derived from Solanum chacoense, was lower than that of the susceptible control ('Russet Burbank'). A07781-4LB and A07781-3LB genotypes were characterized relatively resistant to the pathogen and highly tolerant to ZC symptoms, while A07781-10LB was categorized as susceptible to Lso but relatively tolerant to symptom expression. In stored potatoes, increase in Lso concentrations was observed for all infestation times. However, significantly higher Lso titer was detected in tubers infested 12 DBVR and the effect was similar across genotypes. Overall, the A07781 family can be considered as a promising source of resistance or tolerance to ZC."
https://openalex.org/W3019402391,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and its sequelae present a significant source of economic and societal burden. Introduction of highly effective curative therapies has made HCV elimination attainable. The study used a predictive model to assess the clinical and economic impact of implementing national screening and treatment policies toward HCV elimination in Korea.A previously validated Markov disease progression model of HCV infection was employed to analyze the clinical and economic impact of various strategies for HCV diagnosis and treatment in Korea. In this analysis, the model compared the clinical and economic outcomes of current HCV-related interventions in Korea (7,000 patients treated and 4,200 patients newly diagnosed annually, starting in 2017) to four elimination scenarios: 1) initiating sufficient diagnosis and treatment interventions to meet the World Health Organization's GHSS elimination targets by 2030, 2) delaying initiation of interventions by one year, 3) delaying initiation of interventions by two years and 4) accelerating initiation of interventions to meet elimination targets by 2025. Modelled historical incidence of HCV was calibrated to match a viremic HCV prevalence of 0.44% in 2009. Elimination scenarios required 24,000 treatments and 34,000 newly diagnosed patients annually, starting in 2018, to reach the 2030 targets.Compared to current ""status quo"" interventions, elimination (or accelerated elimination by 2025) would avert 23,700 (27,000) incident cases of HCV, 1,300 (1,400) liver-related deaths (LRDs) and 2,900 (3,100) cases of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) over the 2017-2030 time period. Postponing interventions by one (or two) years would avert 21,100 (18,600) new HCV infections, 920 (660) LRDs and 2,000 (1,400) cases of ESLD by 2030. Following elimination or accelerated elimination strategies would save 860 million USD or 1.1 billion USD by 2030, respectively, compared to the status quo, requiring an up-front investment in prevention that decreases spending on liver-related complications and death.By projecting the impact of interventions and tracking progress toward GHSS elimination targets using modelling, we demonstrate that Korea can prevent significant morbidity, mortality and spending on HCV. Results should serve as the backbone for policy and decision-making, demonstrating how aggressive prevention measures are designed to reduce future costs and increase the health of the public."
https://openalex.org/W3020642778,"BMI1 is a core protein of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) that is overexpressed in several cancer types, making it a promising target for cancer therapies. However, the underlying mechanisms and interactions associated with BMI1-induced tumorigenesis are often context-dependent and complex. Here, we performed a drug resistance screen on mutagenized human haploid HAP1 cells treated with BMI1 inhibitor PTC-318 to find new genetic and mechanistic features associated with BMI1-dependent cancer cell proliferation. Our screen identified NUMA1-mutations as the most significant inducer of PTC-318 cell death resistance. Independent validations on NUMA1-proficient HAP1 and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines exposed to BMI1 inhibition by PTC-318 or BMI1 knockdown resulted in cell death following mitotic arrest. Interestingly, cells with CRISPR-Cas9 derived NUMA1 knockout also showed a mitotic arrest phenotype following BMI1 inhibition but, contrary to cells with wildtype NUMA1, these cells were resistant to BMI1-dependent cell death. The current study brings new insights to BMI1 inhibition-induced mitotic lethality in cancer cells and presents a previously unknown role of NUMA1 in this process."

Globally, the prevalence of resistant hypertension is inclining from time to time and it is yet to be determined in Ethiopia.To assess the prevalence of apparent TRH and its predictors among ambulatory hypertensive patients on follow up in hypertension clinic of Mekelle Hospital, Northern Ethiopia.A hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from Nov 25, 2018 to July 20, 2019, among 338 adult ambulatory hypertensive patients on follow up in Mekelle Hospital hypertension clinic. Hypertensive patient aged ≥18 years who were on regular follow up and taking antihypertensive medications for at least 6 months were included in the study. A simple random sampling technique was used to recruit the study patients.A total of 338 adult ambulatory hypertensive patients were analysed. More than half, 182 (53.8%) patients were females and the average age of the patients was 58.9 ±11.5. Three hundred thirty-three (98.5%) patients had no family history of hypertension. Majority, 66.8% of the patients were on monotherapy. The prevalence of apparent TRH was calculated to be 8.6% [Confidence Interval = 0.056-0.116]. Patients with Body Mass Index(BMI) greater than 30[Adjusted Odds Ratio(AOR) = 12.1, 95%CI:2.00-73.19, p = 0.007] and longer duration of hypertension were the predictors of resistant hypertension.Even if escalation of antihypertensive medications was not aggressive, apparent TRH was common in the study setting. Obesity (BMI greater than 30) and longer duration of hypertension since diagnosis were the predictors of TRH. Meticulous emphasis should be placed on to detect the prevalence of true hypertension resistance and future studies should discover the impact of aggressive antihypertensive medications scale up on the risks of TRH."
https://openalex.org/W3019308175,"In this paper we suggest a new Bayesian approach to network meta-analysis for the case of discrete multiple outcomes. The joint distribution of the discrete outcomes is modeled through a Gaussian copula with binomial marginals. The remaining elements of the hierarchial random effects model are specified in a standard way, with the logit of the success probabilities given by the sum of a baseline log-odds and random effects comparing the log-odds of each treatment against the reference and having a Gaussian distribution centered at the vector of pooled effects. An adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is devised for running posterior inference. The model is applied to two datasets from Cochrane reviews, already analysed in two papers so to assess and compare its performance. We implemented the model in a freely available R package called netcopula."
https://openalex.org/W3020479309,"In the field of songbird neuroscience, researchers have used playback of aversive noise bursts to drive changes in song behavior for specific syllables within a bird's song. Typically, a short (~5-10 msec) slice of the syllable is selected for targeting and the average spectrum of the slice is used as a template. Sounds that are sufficiently close to the template are considered a match. If other syllables have portions that are spectrally similar to the target, false positive errors will weaken the operant contingency. We present a gradient descent method for template optimization that increases the separation in distance between target and distractors slices, greatly improving targeting accuracy. Applied to songs from five adult Bengalese finches, the fractional reduction in errors for sub-syllabic slices was 51.54±22.92%. At the level of song syllables, we use an error metric that controls for the vastly greater number of distractors vs. target syllables. Setting 5% average error (misses + false positives) as a minimal performance criterion, the number of targetable syllables increased from 3 to 16 out of 61 syllables. At 10% error, targetable syllables increased from 11 to 26. By using simple and robust linear discriminant methods, the algorithm reaches near asymptotic performance when using 10 songs as training data, and the error increases by <2.3% on average when using only a single song for training. Targeting is temporally precise, with average jitter of 3.33 msec for the 16 accurately targeted syllables. Because the algorithm is concerned only with the problem of template selection, it can be used as a simple and robust front end for existing hardware and software implementations for triggered feedback."
