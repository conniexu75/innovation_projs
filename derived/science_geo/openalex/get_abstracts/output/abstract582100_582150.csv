https://openalex.org/W2596164112,"HRDetect represents a model integrating whole-genome sequencing mutation signatures associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficiency. The implementation of this predictor across different tumor types identifies a larger proportion of patients displaying ‘BRCAness’ than previously recognized; they might derive benefit from platinum and PARP-inhibitor therapies. Approximately 1–5% of breast cancers are attributed to inherited mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and are selectively sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. In other cancer types, germline and/or somatic mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 (BRCA1/BRCA2) also confer selective sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Thus, assays to detect BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient tumors have been sought. Recently, somatic substitution, insertion/deletion and rearrangement patterns, or 'mutational signatures', were associated with BRCA1/BRCA2 dysfunction. Herein we used a lasso logistic regression model to identify six distinguishing mutational signatures predictive of BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency. A weighted model called HRDetect was developed to accurately detect BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient samples. HRDetect identifies BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient tumors with 98.7% sensitivity (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.98). Application of this model in a cohort of 560 individuals with breast cancer, of whom 22 were known to carry a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, allowed us to identify an additional 22 tumors with somatic loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 and 47 tumors with functional BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency where no mutation was detected. We validated HRDetect on independent cohorts of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers and demonstrated its efficacy in alternative sequencing strategies. Integrating all of the classes of mutational signatures thus reveals a larger proportion of individuals with breast cancer harboring BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency (up to 22%) than hitherto appreciated (∼1–5%) who could have selective therapeutic sensitivity to PARP inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2597078857,"Inducing macromolecular interactions with small molecules to activate cellular signaling is a challenging goal. PROTACs (proteolysis-targeting chimeras) are bifunctional molecules that recruit a target protein in proximity to an E3 ubiquitin ligase to trigger protein degradation. Structural elucidation of the key ternary ligase-PROTAC-target species and its impact on target degradation selectivity remain elusive. We solved the crystal structure of Brd4 degrader MZ1 in complex with human VHL and the Brd4 bromodomain (Brd4BD2). The ligand folds into itself to allow formation of specific intermolecular interactions in the ternary complex. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies, supported by surface mutagenesis and proximity assays, are consistent with pronounced cooperative formation of ternary complexes with Brd4BD2. Structure-based-designed compound AT1 exhibits highly selective depletion of Brd4 in cells. Our results elucidate how PROTAC-induced de novo contacts dictate preferential recruitment of a target protein into a stable and cooperative complex with an E3 ligase for selective degradation."

Liquids, hydrogels, dynamic fibers, colloids, and related massive networks of interacting molecules share, as a defining feature, a lack of fixed stoichiometry, unlike typical quaternary structures. Consequently, they have been termed quinary structures (Chien and Gierasch, 2014Chien P. Gierasch L.M. Challenges and dreams: physics of weak interactions essential to life.Mol. Biol.

Formation of quinary structures often involves multivalent interactions between groups of binding partners (Li et al., 2012Li P. Banjade S. Cheng H.C. Kim S. Chen B. Guo L. Llaguno M. Hollingsworth J.V. King D.S. Banani S.F. et al.Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins.Nature. 2012; 483: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Quinary interactions and colocalization into cellular-scale structures are, in certain cases, distinct processes. For example, stress-triggered quinary assemblies form during mild stress conditions, where stress granule formation does not occur, and when stress granules are pharmacologically blocked (Wallace et al., 2015Wallace E.W.J. Kear-Scott J.L. Pilipenko E.V. Schwartz M.H. Laskowski P.R. Rojek A.E. Katanski C.D. Riback J.A. Dion M.F.

Many studies of quinary behaviors have focused on the role of so-called low-complexity regions (LCRs), protein sequences consisting of a biased subset of amino acids. Multivalent interactions between LCRs can suffice to cause liquid-liquid phase separation, amyloid formation, and other demixing phenomena in vitro (Boke et al., 2016Boke E. Ruer M. Wühr M.

Phase separation by stress-granule-associated proteins in vitro has generally required conditions unrelated to stress-granule formation. Temperatures well below physiological range have been used to stimulate phase separation (Molliex et al., 2015Molliex A. Temirov J. Lee J. Coughlin M. Kanagaraj A.P. Kim H.J. Mittag T. Taylor J.P.

These studies illuminate a range of achievable material states. However, the link between these states and physiological stresses including heat, respiratory chain inhibition, and starvation is not readily apparent. Moreover, stress-related fitness effects arising from disrupting the quinary behavior of stress-granule-associated proteins have remained elusive. A major challenge is to identify whether and how demixing by RNA-binding proteins relates to an organism’s stress tolerance. Toward that end, we have turned our attention to the core stress-granule marker poly(A)-binding protein itself. Like its orthologs across eukaryotes, poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1) in budding yeast consists of a short N-terminal leader sequence; four RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs); a proline-rich LCR termed the P domain, which is predicted to be intrinsically disordered; and a C-terminal peptide binding domain. Pab1 is known to self-interact (Yao et al., 2007Yao G. Chiang Y.C. Zhang C. Lee D.J. Laue T.M. Denis C.L. PAB1 self-association precludes its binding to poly(A), thereby accelerating CCR4 deadenylation in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6243-6253Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although this behavior has not been linked to stress or to phase separation. We show that Pab1 phase separates and gels in response to physiological thermal and pH stresses, a demixing process, which is modulated by the P domain but does not require it. Extracting information from unusual evolutionary patterns, we make mutational perturbations, which systematically alter the temperature onset of phase separation in vitro and demixing in vivo. Mutations that reduce the thermal and pH sensitivity of Pab1’s demixing reduce fitness during growth at high temperature and during energy depletion, indicating that demixing is adaptive. Together, our results illuminate a uniquely complete path from evolved sequence features, to phase separation, to stress-triggered demixing, and finally to organism fitness during stress. Pab1 shows diffuse localization under favorable growth conditions (near 30°C) and localizes to stress granules—large cytosolic foci—within minutes of a shift to 46°C (Figure 1A). At 42°C, Pab1 is not recruited to stress granules detectable by standard fluorescence microscopy (Figure 1A [Cherkasov et al., 2013Cherkasov V. Hofmann S. Druffel-Augustin S. Mogk A. Tyedmers J. Stoecklin G. Bukau B. Coordination of translational control and protein homeostasis during severe heat stress.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 2452-2462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Wallace et al., 2015Wallace E.W.J. Kear-Scott J.L. Pilipenko E.V. Schwartz M.H. Laskowski P.R. Rojek A.E.

Franks A.M. et al.Reversible, specific, active aggregates of endogenous proteins assemble upon heat stress.Cell. 2015; 162: 1286-1298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar]). Consistent with these results, after 10 min at 42°C, pelletable quinary assemblies of Pab1 formed in the absence of Pab1-marked stress granules (Figure 1). After a more severe shock at 46°C, a greater proportion of Pab1 is recruited into small and large sedimentable assemblies (Figure 1) coincident with stress-granule formation. Pab1 may form quinary assemblies by binding to RNA or through protein-protein interactions. To distinguish between these, we measured Pab1 pelleting after RNase treatment (Figure 1B). Pelletable Pab1 from cells grown at 30°C was largely liberated by RNase (Figures 1B and 1C). By contrast, RNase had little effect on assemblies formed at 42°C and no effect after 46°C shock (Figure 1D). Mirroring RNase-resistance observed in yeast and mammalian stress granules ex vivo (Jain et al., 2016Jain S. Wheeler J.R. Walters R.W. Agrawal A. Barsic A. Parker R. ATPase-Modulated Stress Granules Contain a Diverse Proteome and Substructure.Cell. 2016; 164: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), our data indicate that both pre-granular quinary assemblies and stress-granule-associated Pab1 are RNase resistant. Either the quinary assemblies of Pab1 in vivo do not depend on RNA for their integrity, or stabilizing RNAs are efficiently protected from RNase cleavage. We therefore asked how Pab1 demixing depended upon RNA in vitro. We purified recombinant yeast Pab1 from E. coli and assessed Pab1 demixing in vitro under physiological conditions (see STAR Methods). We first asked how Pab1 responded to heat stress with and without polyadenylate RNA, monitoring the soluble fraction by gel filtration and the insoluble fraction on a denaturing gel. We found that 15 μM Pab1 (physiological ∼20 μM, see STAR Methods) was soluble at 30°C but demixed to form large particles after a 46°C, 30 min treatment (Figures 2A and 2B ). Pab1 binds 12 nucleotides of poly(A) RNA with full affinity and protects a footprint of roughly 25 nucleotides (Sachs et al., 1987Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Kornberg R.D. A single domain of yeast poly(A)-binding protein is necessary and sufficient for RNA binding and cell viability.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To promote 1:1 binding, we incubated Pab1 with a small excess of 19-mer polyadenylate RNA (A19). After shifting to 46°C for 30 min, Pab1:RNA complexes partially dissociated, with the free protein demixing into large particles and the released A19 returning to the free pool (Figures 2A and 2B). These results indicate that Pab1 releases RNA and demixes, forming particles stabilized by protein-protein interactions, consistent with its behavior in vivo (Figure 1). To obtain more-sensitive measurements, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS) and monitored the apparent hydration radius (Rh) of a 15 μM Pab1 solution during a slow (0.25°C/min) temperature ramp in the presence of increasing amounts of A19. Rapid particle growth in a narrow temperature window indicated the onset of demixing. We define the demixing temperature (Tdemix) as the temperature at which the apparent hydration radius doubles relative to its baseline value. Anticipating results below, Tdemix represents a measure of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), above which the solution separates into protein-rich and protein-depleted phases. Adding RNA increasingly inhibited Pab1 demixing (Figures 2C and 2D). Alone, Pab1 remained monomeric in shifts up to 33°C (Figure 2E); at these temperatures, S. cerevisiae grows robustly. When shifted to 36°C and above, the onset of the heat-shock response, Pab1 demixed at increasing rates such that by 42°C, where Pab1 in vivo assemblies are detectable after 10 min (Figure 1B), in vitro demixing occurs within seconds (Figure 2E). Demixing halted, but did not reverse, when the temperature was returned to 30°C, indicating lack of self-propagation of quinary assemblies and undetectable reversibility at these timescales (Figure S1). The remarkable acceleration in Pab1 demixing over a few degrees can be quantified by the temperature coefficient, Q10, the ratio of biological properties measured 10°C apart (see STAR Methods) (Kang et al., 2011Kang K. Panzano V.C. Chang E.C. Ni L. Dainis A.M. Jenkins A.M. Regna K. Muskavitch M.A.T. Garrity P.A.

Garrity P. Sensing temperature.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R304-R307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Typical biological processes have a Q10 of 2–4. The radial growth rate of Pab1 assemblies shows a Q1036°C of ∼350 (Figure 2F), placing a conservative lower bound on the volume growth rate. To monitor temperature-dependent structural changes of Pab1 in vitro, we used far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. A dilute sample (0.2 μM, to inhibit demixing) was scanned at 30°C for 30 min, shifted to 42°C, and scanned for a further 30 min (Figure 2G). The CD signal linearly decreased with time at both temperatures following similar kinetics, consistent with adsorption to the cuvette (Figure 2G). To account for this effect, we linearly extrapolated each scan to time zero, yielding scaled spectra (Figure 2G, bottom right). At both 30°C and 42°C, the CD spectrum has a broad negative signal between 200 and 230 nm, consistent with a largely α/β protein. The spectrum at 42°C shows slightly reduced signal between 205 and 230 nm, inconsistent with global denaturation but compatible with a limited conformational change. A similar decrease is seen in the corresponding measurement for RRM1-3, which also undergoes phase separation (Figures S2A and S2B). In vitro demixing does not involve a cooperative global unfolding transition by the bulk of the Pab1 molecules, although different effects may occur in vivo. To examine the physical forces contributing to Pab1 demixing, we asked how changes in ionic strength and pH affected demixing. At or below physiological ionic strength, Pab1 demixed readily at 46°C. At higher salt concentrations, however, demixing was almost completely inhibited (Figures 3A and S3A–S3C ), suggesting an electrostatically mediated process. Demixing was also pH dependent, with demixing inhibited above physiological pH values (pH ∼7 during exponential growth, 6.5 or lower following heat shock). Below pH 5.5, normal growth temperature (30°C) sufficed to induce demixing (Figure 3A).Figure S3Morphology of, and Conditions for, Pab1 Phase Separation, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A–C) Plots in (A) and (B) are reproduced from Figure 3A, with corresponding gels used to quantify fraction pelleted, where (T) is total, (P) is 20,000 g pellet fraction, and (S) is supernatant.

Denaturation of Pab1 at low pH produced grainy, amorphous particles rather than droplets (Figure S3E). Spherical droplets and the appearance of droplets wetting the microscope slide (Figure S3F) revealed the existence of a liquid phase at some time, indicating an initial phase separation. The persistence of clusters indicated that droplets did not coalesce even when in contact, similar to behavior observed in other studies (Lin et al., 2015Lin Y. Protter D.S.W. Rosen M.K. Parker R.

To measure the internal dynamics of pH-induced Pab1 droplets, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. No significant recovery occurred over nearly 7 min (Figure 3C). To examine longer timescales, we triggered phase separation in a 1:20 Clover (green):unlabeled Pab1 solution, waited 5 min, then added 1:20 mRuby2 (red):unlabeled Pab1 solution, forming two-layer droplets. Layers remained intact over 24 hr, indicating little or no mixing (Figure 3D). Plotting Pab1 demixing temperatures observed in temperature-ramp light-scattering experiments at varying pH reveals a continuous phase boundary passing through the physiological ranges of these parameters. Crossing this boundary either by raising temperature or lowering pH (Figure 3E, arrows) causes demixing. We then probed the contributions of each of Pab1’s six domains to phase separation by purifying deletion variants (Figure 3F, Table S1). DLS temperature-ramp experiments revealed that each construct self-associated in a narrow (∼1°C) temperature range, consistent with phase separation. All single-domain-deletion mutants still demixed by 50°C (Figures 3F and S2C). Nevertheless, the deletion of the P domain had the greatest positive effect on Tdemix (Figure 3E). We split Pab1 into its N- and C-terminal halves, RRM1-3 and RRM4-P-C (RPC). RRM1-3 demixed, whereas RPC did not up to 50°C (Figures 3E and S2B). These observations reinforce the finding that the P domain is not required for phase separation. Because the Pab1ΔP lacks an LCR yet retains the ability to phase separate, we examined its assembly morphology by microscopy. Pab1ΔP assemblies largely retained the droplet-cluster morphology of full-length Pab1 quinary assemblies (Figure 3G and 3H). Together, these results point to an electrostatically driven phase separation dependent on molecular determinants in the RRM regions, which is enhanced, but not solely caused, by the P domain. To identify the features of the P domain that might enhance demixing, we examined its sequence (Figure 4A). As the P domain’s name implies, this LCR is rich in proline (19% versus a yeast-proteome-average 4%), along with methionine (10% versus 2%) and glycine (14% versus 5%), and depleted in charged amino acids (Figures 4B and S4A). The rest of Pab1 (Pab1ΔP) exhibits similar amino acid frequencies to the proteome average, as did a set of intrinsically disordered regions (IDR) from DisProt (Sickmeier et al., 2007Sickmeier M. Hamilton J.A. LeGall T. Vacic V. Cortese M.S. Tantos A. Szabo B. Tompa P. Chen J. Uversky V.N. et al.DisProt: the Database of Disordered Proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D786-D793Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) (minimum pairwise rank correlation r = 0.72, p < 10−3 between each of these three sets versus maximum r = 0.19, p = 0.41 between these and P domain). IDRs tend to be proline-rich (Figure 4B). Methionine enrichment, by contrast, we found surprising. The P domain’s fractional methionine content is 5.5-fold higher than the median IDR and greater than 97.5% of these regions.Figure S4The"

Our results support a model of tissue ILC differentiation (“ILC-poiesis”), whereby diverse ILC subsets are generated in situ from systemically distributed ILCPs in response to local environmental signals. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a novel family of lymphoid effector cells that serve essential roles in the early immune response, comprising both “cytotoxic” ILCs (natural killer [NK] cells) and “helper” ILCs. The latter are characterized by CD127 expression and categorized as three groups based on transcription factors (TFs) and cytokine outputs. Group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s) express TBX21 (encoding T-BET) and produce T helper (TH)1-associated cytokines interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Group 2 ILCs (ILC2s) express GATA-3 and related orphan receptor A (RORA) and secrete TH2-associated cytokines, interleukin (IL)-5, and IL-13. Group 3 ILCs (ILC3s) utilize RORC (encoding RORγt) to drive production of the TH17-associated cytokines, IL-17 and/or IL-22 (Serafini et al., 2015Serafini N. Vosshenrich C.A. Di Santo J.P.

These different ILC subsets are found in diverse lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues and enriched at mucosal sites where they play essential roles in barrier function and innate immune defense (Artis and Spits, 2015Artis D.

Two distinct populations of IFN-γ-producing ILC1s have been described. A T-BET+ cell expressing high levels of CD127 and CD161 has been identified in tonsil and inflamed intestine (Bernink et al., 2013Bernink J.H. Peters C.P. Munneke M. te Velde A.A. Meijer S.L.

In contrast, an intraepithelial ILC1 expressing NKp44 and CD103, but not CD127, resides at mucosal sites (Fuchs et al., 2013Fuchs A. Vermi W. Lee J.S. Lonardi S. Gilfillan S. Newberry R.D. Cella M.

Both these ILC1s produce IFN-γ in response to IL-12, but unlike NK cells, they show minimal EOMES expression. Human GATA-3+ ILC2s express the chemoattractant receptor CRTh2 as well as IL-25R and IL-33R (Mjösberg et al., 2011Mjösberg J.M. Trifari S. Crellin N.K. Peters C.P. van Drunen C.M. Piet B.

Artis D. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells in health and disease.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a016337Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Group 3 ILCs include RORγt+ fetal lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells in fetal lymph nodes and spleen (Cupedo et al., 2009Cupedo T. Crellin N.K. Papazian N. Rombouts E.J. Weijer K. Grogan J.L.

Artis D. Innate lymphoid cells as regulators of immunity, inflammation and tissue homeostasis.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). A subset of ILC3s express natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) and are enriched in IL-22-producing cells (Cella et al., 2009Cella M. Fuchs A. Vermi W. Facchetti F. Otero K. Lennerz J.K. Doherty J.M.

Murine ILCs differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) via lymphoid progenitors to yield diverse ID2+TCF-1+PLZF+ ILC precursors (ILCPs) in fetal liver (FL) and adult bone marrow (BM) (Constantinides et al., 2014Constantinides M.G.

Di Santo J.P. Transcriptional regulation of innate lymphoid cell fate.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar); in contrast, human ILC development is less well characterized (Juelke and Romagnani, 2016Juelke K. Romagnani C. Differentiation of human innate lymphoid cells (ILCs).Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2016; 38: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NK precursors (NKPs) have been identified in fetal liver, BM, cord blood (CB), and adult tonsil (Renoux et al., 2015Renoux V.M. Zriwil A. Peitzsch C. Michaëlsson J. Friberg D. Soneji S. Sitnicka E. Identification of a human natural killer cell lineage-restricted progenitor in fetal and adult tissues.Immunity. 2015; 43: 394-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whereas committed ILC3 precursors (ILC3P) are found in tonsil and intestinal lamina propria but not peripheral blood (PB), thymus, or BM (Montaldo et al., 2014Montaldo E. Teixeira-Alves L.G. Glatzer T. Durek P. Stervbo U. Hamann W. Babic M. Paclik D. Stölzel K.

A recent study identified tonsillar human RORγt+ ILCPs that can develop into mature cytotoxic and helper ILCs (Scoville et al., 2016Scoville S.D. Mundy-Bosse B.L. Zhang M.H. Chen L. Zhang X. Keller K.A. Hughes T. Chen L. Cheng S.

Interestingly, these human NKPs, ILC3Ps, and ILCPs were CD34+ and enriched in secondary lymphoid tissues but were rare or absent from the circulation. It was unclear how these CD34+ hematopoietic precursors were developmentally related to mature tissue-resident ILC subsets. In this report, we have extensively characterized the phenotypic, molecular, and functional attributes of PB and tissue CD117+ ILCs. This included an in vitro study of over 1,300 ILC clonal cultures as well as an in vivo analysis using humanized mice. While ILCs with the CD117+ phenotype were previously proposed to represent human ILC3s (Hazenberg and Spits, 2014Hazenberg M.D. Spits H. Human innate lymphoid cells.Blood. 2014; 124: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), we find that PB CD117+ cells are remarkably enriched in multi-potent and uni-potent ILCPs that can give rise in vitro and in vivo to all known ILC subsets, including EOMES+ NK cells. CD117+ ILCPs are found not only in the circulation, but also in tissues where they retain ILC multi-potency. Our identification of systemically distributed ILCPs suggests a model whereby circulating and tissue ILCPs provide a cellular substrate for ILC differentiation in situ in response to local environmental signals. Circulating ILCs can be identified as a low-frequency population (<0.2% of total CD45+ cells) within lineage−CD7+CD56−CD127+ peripheral blood (PB) cells of healthy individuals as well as patients suffering from diverse clinical syndromes ((Hazenberg and Spits, 2014Hazenberg M.D. Spits H. Human innate lymphoid cells.Blood. 2014; 124: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, Munneke et al., 2014Munneke J.M. Björklund A.T. Mjösberg J.M. Garming-Legert K. Bernink J.H. Blom B.

Further fractionation of PB ILCs into ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 has been achieved using phenotypic markers, including CD161, CRTh2, CD117, and NKp44, that distinguish ILC subsets in fetal and adult tissues (Spits et al., 2013Spits H. Artis D. Colonna M. Diefenbach A. Di Santo J.P. Eberl G. Koyasu S. Locksley R.M. McKenzie A.N. Mebius R.E. et al.Innate lymphoid cells--a proposal for uniform nomenclature.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Circulating ILCs include predominant CRTh2+ ILC2 and a CD117+ subset that lacks CRTh2 expression (Figures 1A and 1B). While CD117+ cells are generally considered as circulating ILC3s (Hazenberg and Spits, 2014Hazenberg M.D. Spits H. Human innate lymphoid cells.Blood. 2014; 124: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, Munneke et al., 2014Munneke J.M. Björklund A.T. Mjösberg J.M. Garming-Legert K. Bernink J.H. Blom B.

Hazenberg M.D. Activated innate lymphoid cells are associated with a reduced susceptibility to graft-versus-host disease.Blood. 2014; 124: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we found that PB CD117+ ILCs differ dramatically from gut CD117+ ILCs in that they lack protein expression of NKp44 and RORγt that identifies ILC3 (Figure 1C and S1A). Accordingly, PB CD117+ ILCs do not produce IL-17A or IL-22 after pharmacological stimulation, whereas gut CD117+ cells abundantly produce these ILC3-associated cytokines (Figure 1D). Interestingly, circulating CD117+ ILCs express high levels of IL-1R1 and CD45RA and are CD69−, whereas gut-resident ILC3s are CD69+ but IL-1R1− and CD45RA− (Figure 1C and S1B). These observations suggest that PB CD117+ ILCs differ from bona fide ILC3s.Figure S1CD117+ ILC Gating Strategy, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) FACS analysis of ILCs from human peripheral blood and gut.

(B) Protein staining for surface receptors and intracellular PLZF in blood CD117+ ILC (blue) and NK cells (gray). PB CD117+ ILCs also do not express proteins for TF that characterize other known mature ILC subsets, including T-BET or EOMES (Figure 1C), although a fraction expressed PLZF (Figure S1B). Accordingly, PB CD117+ ILCs failed to express markers associated with NK cells, ILC1 and ILC2, such as CD94, CD244, and CRTh2 (Figure S1B) and did not produce IFN-γ or IL-13 after stimulation with pharmacological activators (Figure 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that PB CD117+ ILCs may represent an unusual ILC subset. In order to further understand the identity of PB CD117+ ILCs, we profiled the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of highly purified circulating CD117+ ILCs compared to CD34+ HSCs (Figure 2A). We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing using transposase-mediated tagmentation (ChIPm-seq) (Schmidl et al., 2015Schmidl C. Rendeiro A.F. Sheffield N.C. Bock C. ChIPmentation: fast, robust, low-input ChIP-seq for histones and transcription factors.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 963-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To expose common and unique epigenetic features of CD34+ HSCs and CD117+ ILCs, we mapped histone H3 lysine 4 di-methyl modifications (H3K4Me2s), which marks both active and poised gene regulatory elements (GREs) (Koche et al., 2011Koche R.P. Smith Z.D. Adli M. Gu H. Ku M. Gnirke A. Bernstein B.E. Meissner A. Reprogramming factor expression initiates widespread targeted chromatin remodeling.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 96-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We identified ∼18,000 and 35,000 GRE in CD117+ ILCs and CD34+ HSCs, respectively (Figure 2B; Table S1), the majority of which were located in introns and intergenic regions (Figure S2A). A significant number of H3K4Me2+ GREs were shared between the two cell types: 89% of GREs identified in CD117+ ILCs showed similar enrichment in HSCs and were associated with 13,159 genes of which many encoded housekeeping functions. Nevertheless, 11% of H3K4Me2+ GREs detected in CD117+ ILCs were absent in CD34+ HSCs, potentially regulating 2,283 genes. Pathway analysis of these genes revealed a strong enrichment for immune system and lymphocyte-related processes. Conversely, GREs only active in CD34+ HSCs were located near genes involved in more general pathways important for hematopoiesis, hemostasis, and platelet activation (Figure 2C).Figure S2Transcriptional and Epigenetics Signature of PB CD117+ ILC, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Annotation of H3K4Me2+ regions as defined by their overlap with known genomic features.(B) Comparative transcriptional and epigenetics profiles of CD117+ ILC and CD34+ HSC for selective loci.

We compared the transcriptome of CD117+ ILCs and CD34+ HSCs. Clear differences in gene expression profiles emerged, with a large cluster of 1,540 genes expressed at substantially higher levels in CD117+ ILCs (Figure 2D; Table S2) including many genes linked to the lymphoid lineage (IKZF1, CD2, CD7, and IL7R). In contrast, CD34+ HSCs highly expressed genes involved in the broader development of diverse hematopoietic lineages, including ID1, GATA1, GATA2, and MYB (Figures 2D and S2B) as well as cytokine receptors for myeloid lineages (CSF3R, CSF2RB, FLT3). Compared to HSCs, CD117+ ILCs express high levels of TFs that have been shown to be essential for murine ILC development, including ID2, GATA3, TOX, and TCF7. We did not detect transcripts characteristic of T and B cells development, such as RAG1, RAG2, EBF1, CD3E, BCL11A, or LMO2 in CD117+ ILC, although some of these genes are expressed by CD34+ HSCs (Figure S2B). As both transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses of CD117+ ILCs identified strong lymphoid signatures, we intersected these datasets in order to gain insights into the developmental status and potential of CD117+ ILCs. A substantial proportion (26%) of the genes most highly expressed in CD117+ ILCs were located in the direct vicinity of a CD117+ ILC-specific GREs (Figure 2E; Table S3). These included many transcription factors previously implicated in mouse ILC development, including ID2, GATA3, ETS1, TOX, TCF7, RORA, ZBTB16, and NOTCH1 (Figures 2E and S2A)—consistent with the commitment of CD117+ ILCs to the innate lymphoid fate. In contrast, we did not detect notable expression levels for TFs (EOMES, TBX21, RORC), cytokine receptors (CCR6, IL1RL1, IL23R), or signature cytokines (IFNG, IL13, IL5, IL22, IL17A) that are abundantly expressed by mature ILCs (Koues et al., 2016Koues O.I. Collins P.L. Cella M. Robinette M.L. Porter S.I. Pyfrom S.C. Payton J.E. Colonna M. Oltz E.M. Distinct gene regulatory pathways for human innate versus adaptive lymphoid cells.Cell. 2016; 165: 1134-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, many of these mature ILC identity genes were already marked with H3K4Me2, demonstrating that they may reside in a poised state (Figures 2F and S2B). Together, these analyses suggest that CD117+ ILC represent lymphoid-biased progenitors reminiscent of multi-potent ILCPs carrying a TF profile with key mature ILC signature genes in an epigenetically poised state. In order to assess the hematopoietic potential of circulating CD117+ ILCs, we cultured these cells in the presence of various cytokines. As CD117+ ILCs express CD25, CD127, and IL-1R1 (Figures 1A, 1C, and S1B), we added IL-2, IL-7, and/or IL-1β to these cultures. While bulk cultures of CD117+ ILCs minimally expanded in the presence of IL-2 and IL-7, robust proliferation was observed when IL-1β was added to the cultures (Figure S3A). The overall cell yield was reduced by more than 100-fold in the absence of any one of these cytokines (Figure S3A). Cultured cells did not harbor B (CD19+) or T (CD3+CD5+) cells but comprised a pure population of CD7+ cells that were CD161+ and expressed variable levels of CD117 and CD25 (Figure 3A). Remarkably, expanded cells included some EOMES+CD94+ NK cells as well as the three canonical ILC groups: IFN-γ+ ILC1, IL-13+ ILC2, and NKp44+IL-17A+IL-22+ ILC3 (Figures 3A and S3B). ILC1 (NKp44−, CD25−), ILC2 (NKp44−CD25+) and ILC3 (NKp44+CD25−) subsets expressed signature TFs (Figure S3C). While the additional presence of cytokines that can drive ILC1/NK (IL-12, IL-18), ILC2 (IL-25, IL-33), or ILC3 (IL-23) development did not further increase cell yield over that obtained with IL-2, IL-7, and IL-1β (Figures 3B and S3A), the addition of IL-12 clearly promoted the development of EOMES+CD94+ IFN-γ-producing NK cells and IL-23 was critical for IL-17A-producing ILC3s (Figures 3A and S3D). These results not only define a cytokine milieu that supports multi-lineage ILC and NK cell generation (IL-2, IL-7, IL-1β, IL-23) but also suggest that the PB CD117+ ILCs harbor multi-potent ILCPs.Figure 3Cloning Reveals Multi-ILC Lineage Potential of CD117+ ILCs In VitroShow full caption(A) FACS analysis of bulk cultured CD117+ ILCs for surface phenotypes, intracellular EOMES, and cytokine expression after 3 hr PMA/ionomycin stimulation to identify NK cells (EOMES+ cells), ILC1s (IFN-γ+ cells), ILC2s (IL-13+), and ILC3s (IL-22+ and/or IL-17A+).(B) Expansion of bulk cultured CD117+ ILCs (10 days) in stromal cell-free conditions with cytokines (20 ng/mL each).

We further characterized circulating CD117+ ILCPs using a modified stromal cell-based culture system that is permissive for B cell, T cell, and myeloid cell development (Figure 3C) (Mohtashami et al., 2010Mohtashami M. Shah D.K. Nakase H. Kianizad K. Petrie H.T. Zúñiga-Pflücker J.C. Direct comparison of Dll1- and Dll4-mediated Notch activation levels shows differential lymphomyeloid lineage commitment outcomes.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, this system can extensively expand human NK cells and ILC subsets at the clonal level (Lim et al., 2016Lim A.I. Menegatti S. Bustamante J. Le Bourhis L. Allez M. Rogge L. Casanova J.L. Yssel H. Di Santo J.P. IL-12 drives functional plasticity of human group 2 innate lymphoid cells.J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We analyzed progeny of single PB CD117+ ILCs cultured on OP9 and OP9-DL4 to identify EOMES+ NK cells and ILC subsets expressing signature TFs and producing IFN-γ, IL-13, IL-17A, and/or IL-22 (Figures 3D and S3E). Our analysis of over 340 clonal PB cultures allows several points to be made. First, PB CD117+ ILCs represent a heterogeneous population of uni-potent and multi-potent ILCPs. Approximately half of the cultures derived from single CD117+ ILCs generated a single ILC1, ILC2, or ILC3 subset and therefore represent lineage-restricted ILCPs, whereas the remainder are multi-potent ILCPs that can give rise to two or more separate Lin−CD7+ ILC lineages (Figure 3E; Table S4). B cell and T cell potential was not observed. Second, within the multi-potent ILCP population, a substantial fraction (between 9%–17%) are able to generate all three ILC subsets and likely represent immature uncommitted ILCPs. Moreover, clonal IFN-γ+ cultures also comprise EOMES+ NK cells demonstrating that some PB ILCPs have the potential to generate both “helper” and “cytotoxic” ILC lineages at the single-cell level. Third, a subset of Lin−CD7+ ILC clones failed to produce any cytokine tested (Figure 3E; Table S4). As these clones maintained a high level of CD117, but lacked other ILC markers, they may represent ILCPs that have not further differentiated (Figure S3F). Fourth, Notch signals clearly influence the cell fate potential of CD117+ ILCPs as multi-potentiality and development of ILC3-containing cells was enhanced on OP9-DL4 (Figure 3E; Table S4). Together, these data identify PB CD117+ ILCs as a circulating pool of partially committed ILC progenitors. The comparison of bulk and clonal assays clearly demonstrate the importance of the single-cell approach to define heterogeneity of CD117+ ILC cell fate potential and to establish functional multi-potency. We next assessed the in vivo potential of PB CD117+ ILCPs. Severely immunodeficient mouse strains engrafted with human CD34+ HSC progenitors generate human lymphoid (B, T, NK) and myeloid (DC, macrophage, neutrophils) cell subsets (reviewed in Rongvaux et al., 2013Rongvaux A.

We used BALB/c Rag2−/−Il2rg−/−SirpaNOD (BRGS) mice that are permissive for robust multi-lineage human hematopoietic cell engraftment, including NK cells (Legrand et al., 2011Legrand N.

Human PB CD34+ HSCs and CD117+ ILCPs were transferred to newborn BRGS mice; cytokine supplementation (human IL-2, IL-7, IL-1β, IL-23) was provided, and mice were analyzed 4 weeks later (Figure 4A).

In multiple sclerosis, remyelination can fail despite abundant oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, suggesting impairment of oligodendrocyte differentiation. T cells infiltrate the CNS in multiple sclerosis, yet little is known about T cell functions in remyelination. We report that regulatory T cells (Treg) promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and (re)myelination. Treg-deficient mice exhibited substantially impaired remyelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation, which was rescued by adoptive transfer of Treg. In brain slice cultures, Treg accelerated developmental myelination and remyelination, even in the absence of overt inflammation. Treg directly promoted oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation and myelination in vitro. We identified CCN3 as a Treg-derived mediator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in vitro. These findings reveal a new regenerative function of Treg in the CNS, distinct from immunomodulation. Although the cells were originally named 'Treg' to reflect immunoregulatory roles, this also captures emerging, regenerative Treg functions."
https://openalex.org/W2592834736,"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus orchestrates daily rhythms of physiology and behavior in mammals. Its circadian (∼24 hr) oscillations of gene expression and electrical activity are generated intrinsically and can persist indefinitely in temporal isolation. This robust and resilient timekeeping is generally regarded as a product of the intrinsic connectivity of its neurons. Here we show that neurons constitute only one ""half"" of the SCN clock, the one metabolically active during circadian daytime. In contrast, SCN astrocytes are active during circadian nighttime, when they suppress the activity of SCN neurons by regulating extracellular glutamate levels. This glutamatergic gliotransmission is sensed by neurons of the dorsal SCN via specific pre-synaptic NMDA receptor assemblies containing NR2C subunits. Remarkably, somatic genetic re-programming of intracellular clocks in SCN astrocytes was capable of remodeling circadian behavioral rhythms in adult mice. Thus, SCN circuit-level timekeeping arises from interdependent and mutually supportive astrocytic-neuronal signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2595351638,"Many genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interest are located outside of protein-coding genes, yet existing methods for identifying such variants have poor predictive power. Here we introduce a new computational method, called LINSIGHT, that substantially improves the prediction of noncoding nucleotide sites at which mutations are likely to have deleterious fitness consequences, and which, therefore, are likely to be phenotypically important. LINSIGHT combines a generalized linear model for functional genomic data with a probabilistic model of molecular evolution. The method is fast and highly scalable, enabling it to exploit the 'big data' available in modern genomics. We show that LINSIGHT outperforms the best available methods in identifying human noncoding variants associated with inherited diseases. In addition, we apply LINSIGHT to an atlas of human enhancers and show that the fitness consequences at enhancers depend on cell type, tissue specificity, and constraints at associated promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2596287310,"The authors used knockout mice to demonstrate the normal function of the protein α-synuclein, which has a central role in Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases. The presynaptic protein promoted dilation of the exocytotic fusion pore, and mutations that cause Parkinson's disease specifically impaired this normal function. The protein α-synuclein has a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Like that of other proteins that accumulate in neurodegenerative disease, however, the function of α-synuclein remains unknown. Localization to the nerve terminal suggests a role in neurotransmitter release, and overexpression inhibits regulated exocytosis, but previous work has failed to identify a clear physiological defect in mice lacking all three synuclein isoforms. Using adrenal chromaffin cells and neurons, we now find that both overexpressed and endogenous synuclein accelerate the kinetics of individual exocytotic events, promoting cargo discharge and reducing pore closure ('kiss-and-run'). Thus, synuclein exerts dose-dependent effects on dilation of the exocytotic fusion pore. Remarkably, mutations that cause Parkinson's disease abrogate this property of α-synuclein without impairing its ability to inhibit exocytosis when overexpressed, indicating a selective defect in normal function."
https://openalex.org/W2595605857,"The primate-exclusive MRGPRX2 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) has been suggested to modulate pain and itch. Despite putative peptide and small-molecule MRGPRX2 agonists, selective nanomolar-potency probes have not yet been reported. To identify a MRGPRX2 probe, we first screened 5,695 small molecules and found that many opioid compounds activated MRGPRX2, including (-)- and (+)-morphine, hydrocodone, sinomenine, dextromethorphan, and the prodynorphin-derived peptides dynorphin A, dynorphin B, and α- and β-neoendorphin. We used these to select for mutagenesis-validated homology models and docked almost 4 million small molecules. From this docking, we predicted ZINC-3573-a potent MRGPRX2-selective agonist, showing little activity against 315 other GPCRs and 97 representative kinases-along with an essentially inactive enantiomer. ZINC-3573 activates endogenous MRGPRX2 in a human mast cell line, inducing degranulation and calcium release. MRGPRX2 is a unique atypical opioid-like receptor important for modulating mast cell degranulation, which can now be specifically modulated with ZINC-3573."
https://openalex.org/W2591646072,"We molecularly dissected leptomeningeal metastasis, or spread of cancer to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is a frequent and fatal condition mediated by unknown mechanisms. We selected lung and breast cancer cell lines for the ability to infiltrate and grow in CSF, a remarkably acellular, mitogen-poor metastasis microenvironment. Complement component 3 (C3) was upregulated in four leptomeningeal metastatic models and proved necessary for cancer growth within the leptomeningeal space. In human disease, cancer cells within the CSF produced C3 in correlation with clinical course. C3 expression in primary tumors was predictive of leptomeningeal relapse. Mechanistically, we found that cancer-cell-derived C3 activates the C3a receptor in the choroid plexus epithelium to disrupt the blood-CSF barrier. This effect allows plasma components, including amphiregulin, and other mitogens to enter the CSF and promote cancer cell growth. Pharmacologic interference with C3 signaling proved therapeutically beneficial in suppressing leptomeningeal metastasis in these preclinical models."
https://openalex.org/W2593074826,"Squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck (HNSCC) is a common yet poorly understood cancer, with adverse clinical outcomes due to treatment resistance, recurrence, and metastasis. Putative cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in HNSCC, and BMI1 expression has been linked to these phenotypes, but optimal treatment strategies to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance and eliminate metastases have not yet been identified. Here we show through lineage tracing and genetic ablation that BMI1+ CSCs mediate invasive growth and cervical lymph node metastasis in a mouse model of HNSCC. This model and primary human HNSCC samples contain highly tumorigenic, invasive, and cisplatin-resistant BMI1+ CSCs, which exhibit increased AP-1 activity that drives invasive growth and metastasis of HNSCC. Inhibiting AP-1 or BMI1 sensitized tumors to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and it eliminated lymph node metastases by targeting CSCs and the tumor bulk, suggesting potential regimens to overcome resistance to treatments and eradicate HNSCC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2594685900,"Poised enhancers marked by H3K27me3 in pluripotent stem cells have been implicated in the establishment of somatic expression programs during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. However, the functional relevance and mechanism of action of poised enhancers remain unknown. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to engineer precise genetic deletions, we demonstrate that poised enhancers are necessary for the induction of major anterior neural regulators. Interestingly, circularized chromosome conformation capture sequencing (4C-seq) shows that poised enhancers already establish physical interactions with their target genes in ESCs in a polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Loss of PRC2 does not activate poised enhancers or induce their putative target genes in undifferentiated ESCs; however, loss of PRC2 in differentiating ESCs severely and specifically compromises the induction of major anterior neural genes representing poised enhancer targets. Overall, our work illuminates an unexpected function for polycomb proteins in facilitating neural induction by endowing major anterior neural loci with a permissive regulatory topology."

Through molecular modeling and comparative analysis of machines assembled with protein-tagged components or from different deletion mutants, we determined the molecular architecture of the secretion machine in situ and localized its structural components.

https://openalex.org/W2594338651,"Eukaryotic mRNAs generally possess a 5' end N7 methyl guanosine (m7G) cap that promotes their translation and stability. However, mammalian mRNAs can also carry a 5' end nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) cap that, in contrast to the m7G cap, does not support translation but instead promotes mRNA decay. The mammalian and fungal noncanonical DXO/Rai1 decapping enzymes efficiently remove NAD+ caps, and cocrystal structures of DXO/Rai1 with 3'-NADP+ illuminate the molecular mechanism for how the ""deNADding"" reaction produces NAD+ and 5' phosphate RNA. Removal of DXO from cells increases NAD+-capped mRNA levels and enables detection of NAD+-capped intronic small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), suggesting NAD+ caps can be added to 5'-processed termini. Our findings establish NAD+ as an alternative mammalian RNA cap and DXO as a deNADding enzyme modulating cellular levels of NAD+-capped RNAs. Collectively, these data reveal that mammalian RNAs can harbor a 5' end modification distinct from the classical m7G cap that promotes rather than inhibits RNA decay."
https://openalex.org/W2595618349,"Although blood-brain barrier (BBB) compromise is central to the etiology of diverse central nervous system (CNS) disorders, endothelial receptor proteins that control BBB function are poorly defined. The endothelial G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr124 has been reported to be required for normal forebrain angiogenesis and BBB function in mouse embryos, but the role of this receptor in adult animals is unknown. Here Gpr124 conditional knockout (CKO) in the endothelia of adult mice did not affect homeostatic BBB integrity, but resulted in BBB disruption and microvascular hemorrhage in mouse models of both ischemic stroke and glioblastoma, accompanied by reduced cerebrovascular canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Constitutive activation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling fully corrected the BBB disruption and hemorrhage defects of Gpr124-CKO mice, with rescue of the endothelial gene tight junction, pericyte coverage and extracellular-matrix deficits. We thus identify Gpr124 as an endothelial GPCR specifically required for endothelial Wnt signaling and BBB integrity under pathological conditions in adult mice. This finding implicates Gpr124 as a potential therapeutic target for human CNS disorders characterized by BBB disruption."

Although quiescent intestinal stem cell (ISC) populations have been described, the identity and features of such a population remain controversial. Here we report unanticipated heterogeneity within the Lgr5+ ISC pool. We found that expression of the RNA-binding protein Mex3a labels a slowly cycling subpopulation of Lgr5+ ISCs that contribute to all intestinal lineages with distinct kinetics. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed that Lgr5+ cells adopt two discrete states, one of which is defined by a Mex3a expression program and relatively low levels of proliferation genes. During homeostasis, Mex3a+ cells continually shift into the rapidly dividing, self-renewing ISC pool. Chemotherapy and radiation preferentially target rapidly dividing Lgr5+ cells but spare the Mex3a-high/Lgr5+ population, helping to promote regeneration of the intestinal epithelium following toxic insults. Thus, Mex3a defines a reserve-like ISC population within the Lgr5+ compartment."

We describe here a powerful anti-inflammatory effect of restraint stress, mediated by C1 neurons: protection against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Restraint stress or optogenetic C1 neuron (C1) stimulation (10 min) protected mice from ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The protection was reproduced by injecting splenic T cells that had been preincubated with noradrenaline or splenocytes harvested from stressed mice. Stress-induced IRI protection was absent in Chrna7 knockout (a7nAChR-/-) mice and greatly reduced by destroying or transiently inhibiting C1. The protection conferred by C1 stimulation was eliminated by splenectomy, ganglionic-blocker administration or β2-adrenergic receptor blockade. Although C1 stimulation elevated plasma corticosterone and increased both vagal and sympathetic nerve activity, C1-mediated IRI protection persisted after subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or corticosterone receptor blockade. Overall, acute stress attenuated IRI by activating a cholinergic, predominantly sympathetic, anti-inflammatory pathway. C1s were necessary and sufficient to mediate this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2592481914,"Synaptic connections undergo activity-dependent plasticity during development and learning, as well as homeostatic re-adjustment to ensure stability. Little is known about the relationship between these processes, particularly in vivo. We addressed this with novel quantal resolution imaging of transmission during locomotive behavior at glutamatergic synapses of the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. We find that two motor input types, Ib and Is, provide distinct forms of excitatory drive during crawling and differ in key transmission properties. Although both inputs vary in transmission probability, active Is synapses are more reliable. High-frequency firing ""wakes up"" silent Ib synapses and depresses Is synapses. Strikingly, homeostatic compensation in presynaptic strength only occurs at Ib synapses. This specialization is associated with distinct regulation of postsynaptic CaMKII. Thus, basal synaptic strength, short-term plasticity, and homeostasis are determined input-specifically, generating a functional diversity that sculpts excitatory transmission and behavioral function."
https://openalex.org/W2595843941,"Gain-of-function mutations in some genes underlie neurodegenerative conditions, whereas loss-of-function mutations in the same genes have distinct phenotypes. This appears to be the case with the protein ataxin 1 (ATXN1), which forms a transcriptional repressor complex with capicua (CIC). Gain of function of the complex leads to neurodegeneration, but ATXN1-CIC is also essential for survival. We set out to understand the functions of the ATXN1-CIC complex in the developing forebrain and found that losing this complex results in hyperactivity, impaired learning and memory, and abnormal maturation and maintenance of upper-layer cortical neurons. We also found that CIC activity in the hypothalamus and medial amygdala modulates social interactions. Informed by these neurobehavioral features in mouse mutants, we identified five individuals with de novo heterozygous truncating mutations in CIC who share similar clinical features, including intellectual disability, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder. Our study demonstrates that loss of ATXN1-CIC complexes causes a spectrum of neurobehavioral phenotypes."

Here we demonstrate that nigrostriatal dopamine biases ongoing action selection. When mice were trained to dynamically switch the action selected at different time points, changes in firing rate of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, as well as dopamine signaling in the dorsal striatum, were found to be associated with action selection. This dopamine profile is specific to behavioral choice, scalable with interval duration, and doesn't reflect reward prediction error, timing, or value as single factors alone. Genetic deletion of NMDA receptors on dopamine or striatal neurons or optogenetic manipulation of dopamine concentration alters dopamine signaling and biases action selection. These results unveil a crucial role of nigrostriatal dopamine in integrating diverse information for regulating upcoming actions, and they have important implications for neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease and substance dependence."

Moreover, subtypes of cytokine classes, such as type I interferons, which signal through a common set of receptors, display selectivity toward specific physiologic responses as a result of alterations in receptor-ligand binding affinities (Spangler et al., 2015Spangler J.B.

How signals from other natural ligands are tuned in this way remains largely unexplored, however, as do the in vivo consequences of variable activation of specific signaling pathways downstream of cytokines. In the context of GPCRs, functional selectivity (or, biased agonism) has been shown to arise from alteration of equilibrium binding affinity of a ligand to its receptor or from stabilization of particular receptor conformations as a result of ligand binding (Kenakin, 2011Kenakin T.

Xiao K. Thomsen A.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent developments in biased agonism.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 27: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A variety of analytic methods have been developed to formalize this concept and primarily rely upon the measurement of the dissociation constant that an agonist has for a particular activity (potency) and the maximal achievable effect downstream of a particular signaling response (efficacy) (Kenakin, 2011Kenakin T. Functional selectivity and biased receptor signaling.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2011; 336: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, Rajagopal et al., 2011Rajagopal S. Ahn S. Rominger D.H.

Pharmacol. 2011; 80: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Indeed, metrics to quantify biased agonism, such as the transducer ratio, have relied upon comparisons between the efficacy and potency for a particular response (Kenakin et al., 2012Kenakin T. Watson C. Muniz-Medina V. Christopoulos A. Novick S. A simple method for quantifying functional selectivity and agonist bias.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2012; 3: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In an analogous manner with GPCRs, recent studies of cytokine signaling have shown that both alteration of ligand-receptor affinities or stabilization of alternative conformational states can lead to biased agonism (Moraga et al., 2015bMoraga I. Wernig G. Wilmes S. Gryshkova V. Richter C.P. Hong W.J. Sinha R. Guo F. Fabionar H.

You C. et al.Receptor dimerization dynamics as a regulatory valve for plasticity of type I interferon signaling.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, emerging evidence suggests that kinetic parameters may also have a key role in determining the extent of biased agonism observed in GPCR signaling (Klein Herenbrink et al., 2016Klein Herenbrink C. Sykes D.A. Donthamsetti P. Canals M. Coudrat T. Shonberg J. Scammells P.J. Capuano B. Sexton P.M. Charlton S.J. et al.The role of kinetic context in apparent biased agonism at GPCRs.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 10842Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Here, through the investigation of rare experiments of nature, we uncover a cytokine-receptor binding kinetic mechanism that alters receptor dimerization dynamics and causes biased downstream signaling by JAK2. Additionally, the insight gained through these functional studies has allowed us to successfully apply recombinant cytokine therapy in a patient with a rare mutation affecting cytokine signaling.

The child was started on and responded to corticosteroids at 1.5 years of age, but severe steroid-induced osteopenia necessitated transitioning back to a chronic transfusion regimen 1 year later. When the child was 6 years of age, a decision was made to proceed with a bone marrow transplant from a fully human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched maternal aunt. Despite the achievement of full donor chimerism, the patient continued to require packed red blood cell transfusions. Gastrointestinal graft versus host disease occurred soon after chimerism was achieved, and by day 150 following the transplant, the patient developed capillary leak syndrome and passed away of resultant complications. Despite the typical clinical and pathologic appearance of DBA (Figure 1C, Figure S1), a number of features made this case unusual. First, stem cell transplantation in DBA normally cures the anemia once donor chimerism is achieved (Roy et al., 2005Roy V. Pérez W.S. Eapen M. Marsh J.C. Pasquini M. Pasquini R. Mustafa M.M. Bredeson C.N. Non-Malignant Marrow Disorders Working Committee of the International Bone Marrow Transplant RegistryBone marrow transplantation for diamond-blackfan anemia.Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant. 2005; 11: 600-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Second, given that DBA is generally thought to display autosomal dominant inheritance, it was surprising to discover that the parents of the child were unaffected first cousins (Figure 1A) (Sankaran et al., 2012Sankaran V.G. Ghazvinian R. Do R. Thiru P. Vergilio J.A. Beggs A.H. Sieff C.A. Orkin S.H. Nathan D.G. Lander E.S. Gazda H.T. Exome sequencing identifies GATA1 mutations resulting in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 2439-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Given these atypical features, whole-exome sequencing of the child was undertaken in an attempt to identify an underlying genetic etiology (Figure 1A) (Casanova et al., 2014Casanova J.L. Conley M.E.

After filtering out common genetic variation, no potential causal mutations could be identified in genes known to cause DBA (Landowski et al., 2013Landowski M. O’Donohue M.F. Buros C. Ghazvinian R. Montel-Lehry N. Vlachos A. Sieff C.A. Newburger P.E. Niewiadomska E. Matysiak M. et al.Novel deletion of RPL15 identified by array-comparative genomic hybridization in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.Hum.

Given that the parents were first cousins and unaffected, we hypothesized that a homozygous recessive mutation might underlie the anemia. By examining candidate homozygous recessive mutations, a previously unknown homozygous mutation in EPO was identified (chr7:100,320,704 G>A). This mutation was absent from a cohort of 60,706 individuals depleted for Mendelian disease (Lek et al., 2016Lek M. Karczewski K.J. Minikel E.V. Samocha K.E. Banks E. Fennell T. O’Donnell-Luria A.H. Ware J.S. Hill A.J. Cummings B.B. et al.Exome Aggregation ConsortiumAnalysis of protein-coding genetic variation in 60,706 humans.Nature. 2016; 536: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (6555) Google Scholar) and occurred in the heterozygous state in the unaffected sibling and parents, fitting the model of complete penetrance for an autosomal recessive mutation (Figures 1A and 2B, Tables S1, S2, and S3). The identified missense variant would result in substitution of glutamine for arginine at position 150 of the mature erythropoietin (EPO) protein (herein R150Q). Curiously, when EPO levels were measured while the patient was on regular transfusions (which will suppress the production of EPO), they were noted to be over 100-fold elevated (767 mU/mL; normal range of 3.5–17.6 mU/mL), suggesting that appropriate and elevated levels of the mutant EPO could be achieved.Figure S1Bone Marrow Aspirate Images from Patient, Related to Figure 1Show full captionBone marrow aspirate images taken at 100× magnification from the proband.

The paucity of erythroid precursors with identifiable cells from other lineages are depicted. Prior literature has shown the importance of the R150 residue in mediating interactions at the high affinity binding site (site 1) on the EPO receptor (EPOR) (Figures 2A and 2B ) (Bunn, 2013Bunn H.F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22839-22846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although mutations of the R150 site have been noted to mildly impair binding, the precise phenotypic effects of such mutations have not been examined in greater detail (Bunn, 2013Bunn H.F. Erythropoietin.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2013; 3: a011619Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To directly assess the effect of this mutation, we produced recombinant wild-type (WT) and mutated EPO. The EPO variant was well expressed and behaved similarly to the WT version (Figure S2A). Electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed the purity and normal glycosylation pattern of the mutant (Figure S2B). EPO R150Q was capable of forming a complex with EPOR of comparable stability to the WT when assessed by multi-angle light scattering coupled to size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALS) (Figures S2C and S2D). This finding suggested that there was likely a comparable affinity between EPOR and both the WT and R150Q forms of EPO. However, we could not obtain a precise measurement of affinity with SEC-MALS and therefore turned to surface plasmon resonance (Jenni et al., 2015Jenni S. Goyal Y. von Grotthuss M. Shvartsman S.Y.

It was therefore surprising that the elevated serum EPO levels in the patient could not compensate for this mildly reduced affinity. Since binding kinetics could not readily be determined given the multi-site interaction of EPO and EPOR, we mutated the low affinity binding site of EPO (site 2, S100E mutation) (Figure 2A) (Bunn, 2013Bunn H.F. Erythropoietin.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2013; 3: a011619Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, Elliott et al., 1997Elliott S. Lorenzini T. Chang D. Barzilay J. Delorme E.

Zhang J. et al.Efficiency of signalling through cytokine receptors depends critically on receptor orientation.Nature. 1998; 395: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). By comparing the WT and R150Q-mutated EPO in the S100E background (allowing only site 1 interactions), we could show that the KD of site 1 binding was reduced 8-fold in the R150Q mutant (Figure 2D, Table S4). Interestingly, the R150Q mutation resulted in a 12-fold faster on-rate (kon), as well as a 233-fold faster off-rate (koff) (Figure 2E, Figure S2E, Table S4). These findings demonstrate that the R150Q mutation only mildly affects the overall affinity, but significantly alters the kinetics of the cytokine’s interaction with EPOR, which could have important consequences for downstream signaling by analogy with other receptor systems (Klein Herenbrink et al., 2016Klein Herenbrink C.

Since the R150Q mutation appeared to alter erythropoiesis in vivo, we examined its effects on erythroid cells in vitro to gain further insight into how it causes disease. We assessed the overall proliferative response of the human erythroid cell line, UT7 (Moraga et al., 2015bMoraga I. Wernig G. Wilmes S. Gryshkova V. Richter C.P. Hong W.J. Sinha R. Guo F. Fabionar H.

This observation suggested that even at concentrations of ligand demonstrating maximal potency (i.e., 10−7 M), the mutated EPO cannot achieve the same effect on cell proliferation as is obtained with WT EPO—implying that when the R150Q EPO concentration is increased to account for affinity loss (as in the patient), it still cannot properly stimulate erythropoiesis. Using the S100E EPO variants, we further demonstrated that the interaction of site 2 was absolutely required to mediate the proliferative response in these cells (Figure S3A).Figure S3Analysis of Cellular Phenotypes of the EPO R150Q Mutant, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Proliferation of UT7 cells stimulated with EPO ligands containing S100E (site 2) mutation.

While fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors for these kinases had previously been developed, they did not provide sufficient sensitivity for imaging small neuronal compartments, such as single dendritic spines in brain slices. Here we improved the sensitivity of FRET-based kinase sensors for monitoring kinase activity under two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2pFLIM). Using these improved sensors, we succeeded in imaging ERK and PKA activation in single dendritic spines during structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, revealing that the activation of these kinases spreads widely with length constants of more than 10 μm. The strategy for improvement of sensors used here should be applicable for developing highly sensitive biosensors for various protein kinases. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

https://openalex.org/W2597327304,"Scientists have long debated the extent to which different brain regions are specialized for specific tasks. Here the authors show that electrical microstimulation of face-selective brain regions in the temporal lobe of monkeys distorts the animal's percept not just of faces but also of certain non-face objects including round objects. What is the range of stimuli encoded by face-selective regions of the brain? We asked how electrical microstimulation of face patches in macaque inferotemporal cortex affects perception of faces and objects. We found that microstimulation strongly distorted face percepts and that this effect depended on precise targeting to the center of face patches. While microstimulation had no effect on the percept of many non-face objects, it did affect the percept of some, including non-face objects whose shape is consistent with a face (for example, apples) as well as somewhat facelike abstract images (for example, cartoon houses). Microstimulation even perturbed the percept of certain objects that did not activate the stimulated face patch at all. Overall, these results indicate that representation of facial identity is localized to face patches, but activity in these patches can also affect perception of face-compatible non-face objects, including objects normally represented in other parts of inferotemporal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2593639501,"Most secreted growth factors and cytokines are functionally pleiotropic because their receptors are expressed on diverse cell types. While important for normal mammalian physiology, pleiotropy limits the efficacy of cytokines and growth factors as therapeutics. Stem cell factor (SCF) is a growth factor that acts through the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase to elicit hematopoietic progenitor expansion but can be toxic when administered in vivo because it concurrently activates mast cells. We engineered a mechanism-based SCF partial agonist that impaired c-Kit dimerization, truncating downstream signaling amplitude. This SCF variant elicited biased activation of hematopoietic progenitors over mast cells in vitro and in vivo. Mouse models of SCF-mediated anaphylaxis, radioprotection, and hematopoietic expansion revealed that this SCF partial agonist retained therapeutic efficacy while exhibiting virtually no anaphylactic off-target effects. The approach of biasing cell activation by tuning signaling thresholds and outputs has applications to many dimeric receptor-ligand systems."
https://openalex.org/W2593993808,"Brain accumulation of the amyloid-β protein (Aβ) and synapse loss are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). Aβ oligomers (AβOs) are synaptotoxins that build up in the brains of patients and are thought to contribute to memory impairment in AD. Thus, identification of novel synaptic components that are targeted by AβOs may contribute to the elucidation of disease-relevant mechanisms. Trans-synaptic interactions between neurexins (Nrxs) and neuroligins (NLs) are essential for synapse structure, stability, and function, and reduced NL levels have been associated recently with AD. Here we investigated whether the interaction of AβOs with Nrxs or NLs mediates synapse damage and cognitive impairment in AD models. We found that AβOs interact with different isoforms of Nrx and NL, including Nrx2α and NL1. Anti-Nrx2α and anti-NL1 antibodies reduced AβO binding to hippocampal neurons and prevented AβO-induced neuronal oxidative stress and synapse loss. Anti-Nrx2α and anti-NL1 antibodies further blocked memory impairment induced by AβOs in mice. The results indicate that Nrx2α and NL1 are targets of AβOs and that prevention of this interaction reduces the deleterious impact of AβOs on synapses and cognition. Identification of Nrx2α and NL1 as synaptic components that interact with AβOs may pave the way for development of novel approaches aimed at halting synapse failure and cognitive loss in AD. Brain accumulation of the amyloid-β protein (Aβ) and synapse loss are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). Aβ oligomers (AβOs) are synaptotoxins that build up in the brains of patients and are thought to contribute to memory impairment in AD. Thus, identification of novel synaptic components that are targeted by AβOs may contribute to the elucidation of disease-relevant mechanisms. Trans-synaptic interactions between neurexins (Nrxs) and neuroligins (NLs) are essential for synapse structure, stability, and function, and reduced NL levels have been associated recently with AD. Here we investigated whether the interaction of AβOs with Nrxs or NLs mediates synapse damage and cognitive impairment in AD models. We found that AβOs interact with different isoforms of Nrx and NL, including Nrx2α and NL1. Anti-Nrx2α and anti-NL1 antibodies reduced AβO binding to hippocampal neurons and prevented AβO-induced neuronal oxidative stress and synapse loss. Anti-Nrx2α and anti-NL1 antibodies further blocked memory impairment induced by AβOs in mice. The results indicate that Nrx2α and NL1 are targets of AβOs and that prevention of this interaction reduces the deleterious impact of AβOs on synapses and cognition. Identification of Nrx2α and NL1 as synaptic components that interact with AβOs may pave the way for development of novel approaches aimed at halting synapse failure and cognitive loss in AD.

As part of a strategy to identify novel AβO-interacting proteins at synapses, we have screened a phage display library to detect peptides that bind Aβ and are homologous to synaptic membrane proteins. Using this approach, we identified a heptapeptide (IGTVDRS) that exhibits significant sequence homology to an amino acid sequence motif contained within the NL-interacting domain in Nrxs. This suggests that Nrxs could represent novel synaptic components targeted by AβOs. Consistent with this hypothesis, we report that AβOs bind different isoforms of Nrx and its trans-synaptic partner, NL. Anti-Nrx2α and anti-NL1 antibodies reduced AβO binding and prevented AβO-induced oxidative stress and synaptotoxicity in cultured hippocampal neurons. Significantly, anti-Nrx2α and anti-NL1 protected against novel object recognition (NOR) memory impairment triggered by AβOs in mice, and anti-Nrx2α further protected against oligomer-induced object location (OL) memory impairment. These findings identify Nrx2α and NL1 as synaptic components targeted by AβOs and indicate that interfering with interactions between AβOs, Nrx2α, and NL1 decreases the impact of AβOs on synapses and cognition. The results may illuminate novel approaches to fight cognitive decline in AD. We initially screened a commercial phage display peptide library (see “Experimental Procedures”) to identify Aβ-binding peptides presenting sequence homology to synaptic membrane proteins. A systematic search of protein databases in NCBI using BLAST revealed that one of the Aβ-binding peptides thus identified (corresponding to the amino acid sequence IGTVDRS, henceforth termed IG peptide) presented significant sequence similarity to a sequence motif present in both Nrxα and Nrxβ (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, this motif is contained within the NL1-binding domain in Nrxs (Fig. 1, B and C) (22Miller M.T. Mileni M. Comoletti D. Stevens R.C. Harel M. Taylor P. The crystal structure of the α-neurexin-1 extracellular region reveals a hinge point for mediating synaptic adhesion and function.Structure. 2011; 19: 767-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We next aimed to biochemically validate the interaction between AβOs and Nrx. Using a plate binding assay (see “Experimental Procedures”), we first found that AβOs bind to the IG peptide (Fig. 1, D and E). Importantly, AβOs bound to purified recombinant full-length Nrx1α and Nrx2α (but not to BSA, used as a negative control) (Fig. 1, F and G). Consistent with recent reports (10Dinamarca M.C. Di Luca M. Godoy J.A. Inestrosa N.C. The soluble extracellular fragment of neuroligin-1 targets Aβ oligomers to the postsynaptic region of excitatory synapses.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2015; 466: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Dinamarca M.C. Weinstein D. Monasterio O. Inestrosa N.C. The synaptic protein neuroligin-1 interacts with the amyloid β-peptide. Is there a role in Alzheimer's disease?.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 8127-8137Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), AβOs bound purified recombinant NL1 (Fig. 1F). We further found that AβOs robustly bound NL2 but not NL3 (Fig. 1G). These results suggest that different isoforms of Nrxα and NL can be synaptic targets of AβOs. We then sought to investigate whether AβOs interact with human NL1 and Nrx2α. Using a ligand capture assay (see “Experimental Procedures”), we found that AβOs interact with both NL1 and Nrx2α, present in human adult brain tissue homogenates, but not with GABAA receptor subunit 5 (GABAAR5), mostly expressed at inhibitory synapses), supporting the notion that AβOs target these proteins in the human brain (Fig. 1H). We further confirmed that recombinant NL1 and Nrx2α directly interacted with each other in our plate binding assay (Fig. 1I). To determine whether the amino acid sequence motif homologous to Nrx that was identified by phage display was relevant for neuronal targeting by AβOs, we tested the ability of the IG peptide to act as a scavenger for AβOs. AβOs were preincubated in solution with the IG peptide at different molar ratios before addition to neuronal cultures. Hippocampal neurons exposed to AβOs incubated previously at a 5:1 Aβ:IG peptide molar ratio showed a 60% decrease in dendritic AβO binding (detected as immunoreactivity toward the NU4 monoclonal anti-AβOs antibody (23Lambert M.P. Velasco P.T. Chang L. Viola K.L. Fernandez S. Lacor P.N. Khuon D. Gong Y. Bigio E.H. Shaw P. De Felice F.G. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Monoclonal antibodies that target pathological assemblies of Aβ.J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar)) compared with neurons exposed to AβOs alone (Fig. 2, A–D). A molar ratio of 1:1 Aβ:IG peptide yielded similar results (data not shown). Because we identified Nrx2α and NL1 as proteins that interact with AβOs, we next hypothesized that Nrx2α and NL1 could mediate AβO binding to cultured hippocampal neurons. We thus asked whether blocking Nrx2α or NL1 with specific antibodies would attenuate AβO binding to neuronal dendrites. For this, we used an anti-Nrx2α antibody recognizing an epitope distal to the Nrx-NL interaction domain (Fig. 1C), thus minimizing the chance that the antibody itself might interfere with trans-synaptic Nrx-NL1 interactions. In addition, the anti-NL1 antibody we used recognizes a region distal to the NL1 esterase domain known to bind Nrxs. To exclude the possibility that the antibodies against synaptic proteins could directly recognize AβOs and thus mask their detection, we initially performed a control plate binding assay and found that neither anti-NL1 nor anti-Nrx2α bound to synthetic AβOs (Fig. 2E). Hippocampal neuronal cultures were then incubated for 30 min with anti-Nrx2α or anti-NL1 antibodies and subsequently exposed to AβOs (500 nm for 3 h). Interestingly, both antibodies caused significant decreases in dendritic binding of AβOs, as detected by the immunoreactivities of both NU4 (23Lambert M.P. Velasco P.T. Chang L. Viola K.L.

Detection of neuronal binding of AβOs using biotin-conjugated AβOs and Alexa-conjugated streptavidin yielded similar results (Fig. 2, P–T).

We hypothesized that interactions of AβOs with Nrx/NL1 could mediate spine/synapse loss in cultured hippocampal neurons.

We initially assessed dendritic spine density in hippocampal cultures by phalloidin labeling. In line with previous studies (8Lacor P.N. Buniel M.C. Furlow P.W. Clemente A.S. Velasco P.T. Wood M.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), exposure of hippocampal neurons to AβOs for 24 h reduced the density of dendritic spines. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with anti-NL1 (Fig. 4, A–D) or anti-Nrx2α (Fig. 4, E–H) prevented oligomer-induced loss of dendritic spines. Further, pretreatment of hippocampal cultures with anti-NL1 blocked AβO-induced loss of synaptophysin/PSD-95 co-localized puncta, a readout of synapse density in cultured neurons (33Christopherson K.S.

Similarly, anti-Nrx2α prevented synapse loss induced by AβOs in hippocampal neurons, as measured by synaptotagmin/PSD-95 co-localization (Fig. 3, E–H). Collectively, the results indicate that interaction of AβOs with NL1 and Nrx2α contributes to AβO-induced neuronal oxidative stress and synapse loss. Last, we asked whether antibodies targeting Nrx2α/NL1 could prevent memory impairment induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of AβOs in mice. Initial analysis in an open field arena showed that the exploratory behavior and locomotor activity of mice were not affected by treatments in any of the experimental groups (data not shown).

Interestingly, i.c.v. infusion of anti-Nrx2α or anti-NL1 (30 min prior to AβOs) prevented NOR memory impairment induced by AβOs (Fig. 6). Control experiments showed that an unrelated IgG (anti-GABAAR5) had no effect on cognitive impairment induced by AβOs (Fig. 6B). We further investigated whether anti-Nrx2α and anti-NL1 could prevent AβO-induced memory impairment in the OL task (Fig. 6, D and E), which assesses a contextual/location type of memory that is more dependent on the hippocampus than NOR (35Barker G.R.

We found that, although AβO-injected mice failed to identify the displaced object, mice injected with anti-Nrx2α had preserved OL memory (Fig. 6E). There was also a trend toward prevention against cognitive impairment in mice injected with anti-NL1, but this was not statistically significant (Fig. 6E). Synapse loss is a cardinal feature of AD and is considered the best neuropathological correlate of memory impairment (1Terry R.D. Masliah E. Salmon D.P. Butters N. DeTeresa R. Hill R. Hansen L.A.

Thus, approaches aimed to identify specific synaptic components targeted by Aβ hold significant potential to illuminate novel therapeutic strategies in AD. Using phage display of a peptide library, we identified an Aβ-binding heptapeptide that was highly homologous to a sequence motif present in the NL-binding site in Nrxs and represents a potential novel AβO-binding site at synapses. Nrxs and NLs are cell adhesion molecules that promote synapse stabilization and plasticity, learning, and memory (15Bemben M.A. Shipman S.L. Nicoll R.A. Roche K.W.

https://openalex.org/W2594755029,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a multidrug transporter that uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to export many structurally dissimilar hydrophobic and amphipathic compounds, including anticancer drugs from cells. Several structural studies on purified P-gp have been reported, but only limited and sometimes conflicting information is available on ligand interactions with the isolated transporter in a dodecyl-maltoside detergent environment. In this report we compared the biochemical properties of P-gp in native membranes, detergent micelles, and when reconstituted in artificial membranes. We found that the modulators zosuquidar, tariquidar, and elacridar stimulated the ATPase activity of purified human or mouse P-gp in a detergent micelle environment. In contrast, these drugs inhibited ATPase activity in native membranes or in proteoliposomes, with IC50 values in the 10-40 nm range. Similarly, a 30-150-fold decrease in the apparent affinity for verapamil and cyclic peptide inhibitor QZ59-SSS was observed in detergent micelles compared with native or artificial membranes. Together, these findings demonstrate that the high-affinity site is inaccessible because of either a conformational change or binding of detergent at the binding site in a detergent micelle environment. The ligands bind to a low-affinity site, resulting in altered modulation of P-gp ATPase activity. We, therefore, recommend studying structural and functional aspects of ligand interactions with purified P-gp and other ATP-binding cassette transporters that transport amphipathic or hydrophobic substrates in a detergent-free native or artificial membrane environment."
https://openalex.org/W2593841038,"The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a key therapeutic target in the management of type II diabetes mellitus, with actions including regulation of insulin biosynthesis and secretion, promotion of satiety, and preservation of β-cell mass. Like most class B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), there is limited knowledge linking biological activity of the GLP-1R with the molecular structure of an intact, full-length, and functional receptor·ligand complex. In this study, we have utilized genetic code expansion to site-specifically incorporate the photoactive amino acid p-azido-l-phenylalanine (azF) into N-terminal residues of a full-length functional human GLP-1R in mammalian cells. UV-mediated photolysis of azF was then carried out to induce targeted photocross-linking to determine the proximity of the azido group in the mutant receptor with the peptide exendin-4. Cross-linking data were compared directly with the crystal structure of the isolated N-terminal extracellular domain of the GLP-1R in complex with exendin(9–39), revealing both similarities as well as distinct differences in the mode of interaction. Generation of a molecular model to accommodate the photocross-linking constraints highlights the potential influence of environmental conditions on the conformation of the receptor·peptide complex, including folding dynamics of the peptide and formation of dimeric and higher order oligomeric receptor multimers. These data demonstrate that crystal structures of isolated receptor regions may not give a complete reflection of peptide/receptor interactions and should be combined with additional experimental constraints to reveal peptide/receptor interactions occurring in the dynamic, native, and full-length receptor state.

Accounting for as much as 2% of the human genome (2Lagerström M.C. Schiöth H.B. Structural diversity of G protein-coupled receptors and significance for drug discovery.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), GPCRs have a fundamental role in almost all physiological functions and as such have become key therapeutic targets in the treatment of many disease states. Although almost one-third of marketed drugs act on GPCRs (3Santos R. Ursu O. Gaulton A. Bento A.P. Donadi R.S. Bologa C.G. Karlsson A. Al-Lazikani B. Hersey A. Oprea T.I. Overington J.P.

Drug Discov. 2017; 16: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar), very few target the small subgroup of peptide-activated class B “secretin-like” receptors. Despite this, class B GPCRs have been validated for the treatment of a number of disease conditions, including depression and anxiety (corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors), osteoporosis (calcitonin and parathyroid hormone receptors), and metabolic disorders (glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), glucagon (GCG), and amylin receptors) (4Pal K.

Although crystallography is a powerful technique in establishing receptor structure, this platform only identifies static snapshots of highly dynamic entities. Furthermore, none of the reported class B structures are of full-length receptor proteins; N-terminal structures lack the entire TM region, and TM structures have substantial N- and C-terminal truncations. As with all documented GPCR crystal structures, both GCGR and CRF1R were purified with large bulky modifications (T4L for CRF1R and BRIL or T4L for GCGR), multiple thermostabilizing mutations, and were crystallized in the presence of small molecule antagonists (11Jazayeri A.

Consequently, the information ascertained from these structures may not give a complete account of native receptor configuration or peptide/receptor interactions required to achieve the “active” receptor conformations that drive intracellular signaling. Beyond crystallography, investigation of peptide/receptor interactions has principally involved receptor mutagenesis and incorporation of photolabile probes into peptides (14Dong M. Koole C. Wootten D. Sexton P.M. Miller L.J. Structural and functional insights into the juxtamembranous amino-terminal tail and extracellular loop regions of class B GPCRs.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171: 1085-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). While providing valuable insights, both strategies have limited interpretability due to structural perturbations inflicted on the receptor and peptide, respectively. More recently, genetic incorporation of photoactive unnatural amino acids into receptor proteins at putative peptide/receptor interaction points has gained traction, because of high tolerability and low impact on structural integrity (15Grunbeck A.

The subject of this study, GLP-1R, plays a fundamental role in controlling post-prandial insulin secretion upon interaction with its cognate ligand, GLP-1, or exogenous peptides, such as exendin-4 (28Eng J.

Additionally, with a broad range of actions, including promotion of insulin synthesis, decreasing GCG production, preservation of pancreatic β-cell mass, decreasing appetite, and gastric emptying, as well as cardio- and neuroprotective functions (29Koole C.

As such, comprehensive knowledge of peptide/receptor interactions within this receptor system is vital in the development of superior therapeutics to manage the condition. In this study, we have successfully incorporated the photoactive amino acid p-azido-l-phenylalanine (azF) into the human GLP-1R at N-terminal ECD sites reported to interact with peptide agonists (Table 1). Using the photocross-linking feature of azF, we have mapped the principal binding region between the GLP-1R N terminus and the exogenous peptide exendin-4 in live cells expressing intact GLP-1R, and we have used these data to generate a detailed model of the GLP-1R·exendin-4 complex. We observe that not all GLP-1R/exendin-4 interactions or proximity estimates documented in the literature are consistent with cross-linking data, demonstrating that crystal structures of isolated receptor regions (N-terminal or TM domains) may not give a true reflection of peptide/receptor interactions occurring in the dynamic, native, and full-length receptor state. Expansion of this technology to include other GLP-1R peptide ligands may allow for detection of subtle differences in receptor/peptide interactions and binding domains, aiding our understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between peptide binding and biased signaling at the GLP-1R.Table 1AzF-substituted residues of the human GLP-1R studied for cross-linking and their previously documented interactions with peptideGLP-1R residueReported interaction/saPeptide residue number is denoted in superscript following single code amino acid.Reported interactions in class B GPCR equivalent residuesRefs.Val-30Ligand recognition/specificity5Runge S.

The ability to learn and adapt to the changing environment is crucial for human cognition and has long been thought to depend on experience-dependent modification of synaptic efficacy and circuit connectivity in the brain (Bailey and Kandel, 1993Bailey C.H.

Dysregulated synaptic structure and function are associated with brain disorders ranging from neurodevelopmental to neurodegenerative diseases such as intellectual disability (ID), autism, and Alzheimer’s disease (Selkoe, 2002Selkoe D.J. Alzheimer’s disease is a synaptic failure.Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3396) Google Scholar, Volk et al., 2015Volk L. Chiu S.L. Sharma K. Huganir R.L. Glutamate synapses in human cognitive disorders.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 38: 127-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Synaptic plasticity, one of the most promising cellular models for learning and memory, often refers to a functional adaptation that transforms patterned neuronal activity into long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy: long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD). At glutamatergic synapses, LTP and LTD require the addition or removal of synaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Therefore, the mechanisms that regulate AMPAR trafficking are critical for synaptic plasticity and human cognitive behaviors (Huganir and Nicoll, 2013Huganir R.L. Nicoll R.A.

Synaptic AMPA receptor plasticity and behavior.Neuron. 2009; 61: 340-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). AMPARs conduct the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the CNS and are tetrameric receptors composed of subunits GluA1–4 (Shepherd and Huganir, 2007Shepherd J.D. Huganir R.L. The cell biology of synaptic plasticity: AMPA receptor trafficking.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 613-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). To adjust synaptic efficacy, AMPARs are dynamically regulated through continual endocytosis, sorting and recycling to the cell surface, or lysosomal degradation (Anggono and Huganir, 2012Anggono V.

AMPAR-interacting proteins are key players in these processes. For example, PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase 1) is involved in the retention of endocytosed AMPARs (Perez et al., 2001Perez J.L. Khatri L. Chang C. Srivastava S. Osten P. Ziff E.B.

Synapse function is also regulated by Rab family GTPases, molecular motors, or SNARE membrane fusion proteins via regulation of endocytic AMPAR trafficking under basal conditions and in response to neuronal activity (Esteban, 2008Esteban J.A.

Recycling endosomes regulate the balance of lipids and membrane proteins in the plasma membrane and are important for many cellular processes including cell adhesion, migration, and morphogenesis (Grant and Donaldson, 2009Grant B.D.

McGraw T.E. Endocytic recycling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). In cultured hippocampal neurons, recycling endosomes have been reported to be a key source to supply AMPARs and membrane per se at glutamatergic synapses. A general block of recycling endosomes with dominant-negative Rab11 or Syntaxin13 (Stx13) interferes with endosome fusion and impairs activity-induced synaptic AMPAR targeting and synaptic potentiation (Park et al., 2004Park M. Penick E.C. Edwards J.G. Kauer J.A.

Similarly, blocking recycling endosome trafficking abolishes activity-dependent membrane trafficking and subsequent expansion of existing spines as well as formation of new spines (Park et al., 2006Park M. Salgado J.M. Ostroff L. Helton T.D. Robinson C.G. Harris K.M.

While these results strongly support an activity-dependent role for recycling endosomes in coordinating synaptic structure and function in neurons, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved and their physiological roles in vivo remain unexplored. GRASP1 (GRIP-associated protein 1) is a neuron-specific endosomal protein, which was identified as part of an AMPAR complex through a direct interaction with the AMPAR scaffolding protein GRIP1 (Ye et al., 2000Ye B. Liao D. Zhang X. Zhang P. Dong H. Huganir R.L. GRASP-1: a neuronal RasGEF associated with the AMPA receptor/GRIP complex.Neuron. 2000; 26: 603-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recycling endosomes are formed through a series of membrane fusions of Rab5-positive early endosomes to Rab4-positive early/recycling endosomes, and Rab4-positive endosomes to Rab11-positive mature recycling endosomes destined for exocytosis to the plasma membrane (Sönnichsen et al., 2000Sönnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. Distinct membrane domains on endosomes in the recycling pathway visualized by multicolor imaging of Rab4, Rab5, and Rab11.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Recently, GRASP1 was reported to play an important role in promoting recycling endosome maturation by facilitating the transition from Rab4- to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes (Hoogenraad et al., 2010Hoogenraad C.C. Popa I. Futai K. Martinez-Sanchez E. Wulf P.S. van Vlijmen T. Dortland B.R. Oorschot V. Govers R. Monti M. et al.Neuron specific Rab4 effector GRASP-1 coordinates membrane specialization and maturation of recycling endosomes.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As a recycling endosome protein that also interacts with the AMPAR complex, we hypothesize that GRASP1 may be a key molecule essential for experience-dependent remodeling of synaptic transmission and structure necessary for proper learning and memory. Here, we report that Grasp1 knockout (KO) mice exhibit decreased glutamatergic synaptic connectivity and defective synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Moreover, Grasp1 KO mice displayed significantly impaired associative and spatial learning and memory, likely due to a failure in learning-induced synaptic AMPAR targeting. Furthermore, we identified two GRASP1 mutations that segregate with severe ID. GRASP1 ID mutations impaired activity-dependent AMPAR recycling by trapping internalized AMPAR in recycling endosomes and altering their interactions with key endosomal proteins, GRIP1 and Stx13. Molecular replacement with GRASP1 ID mutants significantly impaired glutamate uncaging-induced AMAPR incorporation and spine enlargement. Expression of wild-type (WT) GRASP1, but not ID-associated mutants, rescued spine loss in hippocampal CA1 neurons in Grasp1 KO mice, demonstrating the functional significance of ID mutations in vivo. Together, our study provides insights for the physiological and pathological roles of GRASP1 in regulating experience-dependent synaptic strengthening and cognitive functions. To investigate physiological functions of GRASP1 in vivo, we generated Grasp1 KO mice (Figure S1) and tested whether GRASP1 regulates basal AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. Spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were isolated and recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons of juvenile (postnatal day [P]21–P23) Grasp1 animals. A change in mEPSC amplitude indicates a change in the number of AMPARs at postsynaptic sites, while a change in mEPSC frequency suggests alteration of synapse number or presynaptic vesicle release probability. We found no change in the mEPSC amplitude between WT and KO mice, suggesting GRASP1 does not regulate steady-state postsynaptic AMPAR number (Figures 1B and 1D ). However, mEPSC frequency in KO mice was significantly reduced compared to WT littermates (Figures 1A and 1C), suggesting that GRASP1 mediates neuronal connectivity and/or presynaptic glutamate release. To test whether the reduced mEPSC frequency reflects a decrease in glutamatergic synapse number, we crossed Grasp1 mice with Thy1-GFP transgenic mice to sparsely label CA1 neurons with a GFP-fill (Figure 1E). We found that the glutamatergic synapse density, quantified as the number of spines on secondary dendrites, was significantly lower in juvenile KO than WT littermates (Figures 1E and 1F), suggesting that GRASP1 regulates neuronal connectivity in the developing hippocampus. To test whether GRASP1 influences synaptic plasticity, we examined NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated LTP induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS). LTP induction resulted in an initially less potentiated field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) and remained reduced for at least 1 hr in Grasp1 KO mice (Figures 2A–2C). Since this form of LTP results from an increase in postsynaptic AMPARs (Huganir and Nicoll, 2013Huganir R.L. Nicoll R.A. AMPARs and synaptic plasticity: the last 25 years.Neuron. 2013; 80: 704-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), these results suggest that GRASP1 is required for the appropriate delivery of synaptic AMPARs in response to TBS. On the other hand, NMDAR-mediated LTD was not different between KO and WT mice (Figures 2D and 2E), suggesting a specific role of GRASP1 in activity-dependent incorporation, but not removal, of synaptic AMPARs. We further tested whether GRASP1 regulates presynaptic function by comparing paired-pulse ratios (PPRs), a standard approach to assess neurotransmitter release probability. Grasp1 KO mice showed comparable PPRs in a wide range of inter-stimulus intervals, suggesting that GRASP1 does not regulate presynaptic vesicle release (Figure 2F). Together with the observation that Grasp1 KO mice had fewer spines, we concluded that the attenuated mEPSC frequency reflects primarily a reduction in glutamatergic inputs onto hippocampal CA1 neurons. Next, we tested whether GRASP1 is required for normal animal behavior using the Morris water maze (MWM) task, a hippocampal-dependent learning and memory assay (Morris, 1984Morris R. Developments of a water-maze procedure for studying spatial learning in the rat.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1984; 11: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5771) Google Scholar). To test spatial learning, adult (2–5 months old) Grasp1 mice were trained to locate a hidden platform in association with four visual cues in a water maze. Mice were automatically tracked and their swim latencies and distances to the platform were analyzed for 8 sessions over a 4-day period. During the initial training sessions, KO and WT mice spent similar time and swam a similar distance to find the hidden platform, suggesting they have comparable swim and motor capability (Figure 3A). However, WT mice learned to locate the platform rapidly and reached their plateau performance by the fifth session, whereas the KO mice did not achieve similar latency until session 7 (Figure 3A). Similar learning curves were observed with swim distance analysis (Figure S2C). To test spatial memory, we conducted a probe test 1 day after the final training session in which mice were exposed to the same arena but the platform was removed. In contrast to WT mice, which spent significantly more time in the target quadrant, KO mice showed no spatial preference and made fewer crossings over the prior platform location (Figures 3B and 3C), indicating their impaired memory retention. When exposed to the same arena with a visible platform at different quadrants, mice of either genotype showed similar latencies and distances to the platform, indicating their normal visual perception and swimming capability (Figures S2D and S2E). Together, these data suggest that GRASP1 is critical for hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory. Learning induces LTP in the hippocampus in vivo by incorporating more AMPARs into synapses (Whitlock et al., 2006Whitlock J.R. Heynen A.J. Shuler M.G. Bear M.F. Learning induces long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Science. 2006; 313: 1093-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar), whereas blocking synaptic delivery of AMPARs is known to impair hippocampus-dependent learning (Mitsushima et al., 2011Mitsushima D. Ishihara K. Sano A. Kessels H.W. Takahashi T. Contextual learning requires synaptic AMPA receptor delivery in the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 12503-12508Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To test whether GRASP1 regulates experience-dependent synaptic AMPAR delivery in vivo, we used inhibitory avoidance (IA), a single-trial associative learning task previously shown to induce LTP and synaptic AMPAR incorporation in the dorsal hippocampus (Cammarota et al., 1998Cammarota M. Bernabeu R. Levi De Stein M. Izquierdo I. Medina J.H. Learning-specific, time-dependent increases in hippocampal Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity and AMPA GluR1 subunit immunoreactivity.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2669-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Whitlock et al., 2006Whitlock J.R. Heynen A.J. Shuler M.G. Bear M.F. Learning induces long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Science. 2006; 313: 1093-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). Adult mice were first habituated to an arena consisting of light and dark chambers separated by a guillotine-style gate. When introduced to the light side, both WT and KO littermates shortly entered the dark chamber due to a natural preference for a dark environment (Figures S2F and 3D). During IA training, a mild foot shock was delivered to the mice upon entering the dark chamber. When tested 24 hr after shock, WT animals displayed a long step-through latency, showing clear associative memory, while Grasp1 KO mice showed significantly shorter step-through latency, indicating their impairment in IA learning/memory (Figure 3D). Because impaired synaptic connectivity and LTP were observed in juvenile mice, we further tested IA on 3-week-old Grasp1 mice. Similarly, juvenile KO mice showed a shorter step-through latency to the dark chamber after shock (Figure 3E), indicating that IA learning/memory impairment occurs early during development. To test whether GRASP1 is required for learning-induced synaptic AMPAR delivery, we isolated the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction, highly enriched in synaptic proteins, from the dorsal hippocampus of adult Grasp1 mice 30 min following IA training. Consistent with previous findings, we found that in WT animals, IA training increased the levels of GluA1, 2, and 3 AMPAR subunits compared to littermates that did not receive a foot shock (Figures 3F and 3G). The learning-induced increase in synaptic glutamate receptors is AMPAR specific because we did not detect changes in the NMDAR subunit GluN1 or the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Remarkably, this learning-induced increase in AMPAR is completely abolished in KO mice (Figures 3F and 3G). AMPARs in the post-nuclear supernatant 1 (S1) fraction remain comparable regardless of the genotype and IA training, indicating that GRASP1 is specifically required for synaptic delivery of AMPARs during IA learning (Figures 3H and 3I). Taken together, these data demonstrate a critical role for GRASP1 in spatial (MWM) and associative (IA) learning and memory, likely via regulation of activity-dependent AMPAR trafficking and synaptic potentiation. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which GRASP1 enhances AMPAR synaptic targeting during LTP, we used primary neurons with a well-established glycine-induced, NMDAR-dependent chemical LTP (cLTP) protocol that elicits synaptic AMPAR insertion supplied from recycling endosomes (Lu et al., 2001Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T.

Consistent with previous reports, we observed a 20%–30% increase in synaptic GluA1–3 subunits in PSD fractions upon glycine treatment (Figures 4A and 4B ). Interestingly, we also detected a significant increase in the abundance of GRASP1 and GRIP1 in the PSD, substantially larger than AMPARs (Figures 4A and 4B). We did not observe significant differences in the endocytosis trafficking protein, PICK1, or another GRASP1-interacting endosomal protein, Stx13 (Figures 4A and 4B). Notably, we saw no changes in total cellular levels of these proteins before and after cLTP, indicating that the PSD enrichments of GRASP1, GRIP1, and AMPARs are a result of trafficking events rather than an effect on total protein levels (Figures 4A and 4C). If GRASP1 and GRIP1 were actively recruited to synaptic fractions to facilitate AMPAR insertion during plasticity, we would expect to see an increase in their interaction with AMPARs upon glycine treatment. To test this, we immunoprecipitated AMPARs using a GluA1 antibody from cultured neurons before and after glycine treatment at various times. The presence of GRASP1 and GRIP1 in the immunoprecipitates indicated that GRASP1 is part of the GluA1/2 AMPAR protein complex (Figures 4D–4G). Moreover, we observed that both GRASP1-AMPAR and GRIP1-AMPAR associations were significantly enhanced at 5 and 10 min following glycine stimulation (Figures 4D–4F). Together, these data suggest that GRASP1 and GRIP1 function cooperatively to facilitate synaptic AMPAR delivery during activity-dependent synaptic potentiation. Given GRASP1’s function in neuronal connectivity, synaptic plasticity, and learning/memory in mice, we hypothesized that GRASP1 may be important for human cognitive function. Interestingly, GRASP1 is an X chromosome gene located at Xp11.23, a region that has been previously associated with ID and autism (Chung et al., 2011Chung B.H. Drmic I. Marshall C.R. Grafodatskaya D.

We performed a screen on a cohort of well-characterized male probands (n = 400) with ID and a pedigree consistent with X-linked (XL) inheritance (Wu et al., 2007Wu Y. Arai A.C. Rumbaugh G.

In one XL-ID family, we identified a GRASP1 missense mutation, c.2465G>A; p.R822Q, in two brothers with severe ID. This mutation segregated with the ID phenotype in this family (Figure S3) and was not found in a screen of 1,377 males with normal cognitive function. X chromosome-exome sequencing of the affected brothers identified no additional causal mutation for the ID phenotype (Niranjan et al., 2015Niranjan T.S. Skinner C. May M. Turner T. Rose R. Stevenson R. Schwartz C.E. Wang T. Affected kindred analysis of human X chromosome exomes to identify novel X-linked intellectual disability genes.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0116454Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Further screening of this XL-ID cohort identified another missense mutation, c.218G>A; p.S73N, in a 28-year-old male with severe ID and a pedigree consistent with X-linked inheritance (BH0092, Human Genetics Collection, ECACC). This mutation was not found in a screen of 1,295 males with normal cognitive function. Interestingly, both R822Q and S73N mutations involve evolutionarily conserved residues, suggesting that these sites may be important for GRASP1 function (Figure 5B). Two polymorphic GRASP1 missense variants, c.536C>T; p.P179L and c.1733A>C; p.E578A, were identified in both ID patients and normal controls in this study. To test whether GRASP1 ID mutations impact endosomal recycling of AMPARs, we employed a molecular replacement approach to examine AMPA-induced AMPAR recycling. Hippocampal neurons were transfected with GFP alone, or together with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting endogenous GRASP1 for protein knockdown (KD) and shRNA-resistant GRASP1 WT, S73N, or R822Q. Transfected neurons were stimulated with or without AMPA for 2 min to induce AMPAR internalization followed by a 58 min recovery period during which internalized AMPARs recycle back to the cell surface (Hoogenraad et al., 2010Hoogenraad C.C. Popa I. Futai K. Martinez-Sanchez E. Wulf P.S. van Vlijmen T. Dortland B.R. Oorschot V. Govers R. Monti M. et al.Neuron specific Rab4 effector GRASP-1 coordinates membrane specialization and maturation of recycling endosomes.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Surface levels of endogenous GluA2 (sGluA2) were used as an indicator to evaluate the effect of GRASP1 ID mutations on AMPAR recycling since we did not observe a difference in the AMPA-induced AMPAR internalization in GRASP1 ID mutant-replaced cells (Figure S4). In mock-treated neurons, sGluA2 signals were comparable among all groups, demonstrating that neither loss of GRASP1 nor expression of GRASP1 ID mutants affects basal AMPAR surface expression (Figures 5C and 5E). However, 58 min following AMPA stimulation, when most AMPARs have recycled back to surface in controls, KD neurons showed significantly less sGluA2, suggesting that GRASP1 is required for efficient AMPAR recycling (Figures 5D and 5F). We observed a full rescue of the sGluA2 level when neurons were co-transfected with a shRNA-resistant WT GRASP1. However, neither of the ID mutations rescued the reduced sGluA2, indicating a convergent effect of these ID mutants on activity-dependent AMPAR recycling (Figures 5D and 5F).

This process allows the generation of a double-stranded RNA for Dicer-like protein cleavage to give rise to a population of small regulatory RNAs that precisely match the excised DNA sequences. The functions of small RNAs in the eukaryotic cell are many and varied and their study continues to yield new insights into biological processes. The most well-characterized small RNA pathways are involved in silencing, either on the DNA level where transposons are silenced by Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) during germline development, or post-transcriptionally where small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) control gene expression through mRNA degradation and translational inhibition (Kawaji and Hayashizaki, 2008Kawaji H. Hayashizaki Y. Exploration of small RNAs.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e22Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are involved in post-transcriptional RNA processing including splicing and RNA editing (Matera et al., 2007Matera A.G. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Non-coding RNAs: lessons from the small nuclear and small nucleolar RNAs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). More recently, additional small RNA pathways have been discovered with roles in processes such as DNA repair (Wei et al., 2012Wei W. Ba Z. Gao M. Wu Y. Ma Y. Amiard S. White C.I. Rendtlew Danielsen J.M. Yang Y.-G. Qi Y. A role for small RNAs in DNA double-strand break repair.Cell. 2012; 149: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and transcriptional enhancement (Kim et al., 2010Kim T.-K. Hemberg M. Gray J.M. Costa A.M. Bear D.M. Wu J. Harmin D.A. Laptewicz M. Barbara-Haley K. Kuersten S. et al.Widespread transcription at neuronal activity-regulated enhancers.Nature. 2010; 465: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). It seems likely that additional classes of small RNAs await discovery as sequencing technologies continue to improve. The mechanisms by which small RNAs are produced are as diverse as the functions of the RNAs themselves. In many cases, the RNAs are produced from specific genes that have evolved separately from the RNA targets—this is the case for most miRNAs and for the snRNAs (Ha and Kim, 2014Ha M. Kim V.N. Regulation of microRNA biogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). In other cases, the small RNAs are generated directly from the sequence that they target, such as when siRNAs are generated from invading double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). piRNAs are generated from large piRNA transcription units, similar to miRNAs, but these clusters are mostly generated from ancient transposons, which are thus in some senses promoting their own silencing (Czech and Hannon, 2016Czech B. Hannon G.J. One loop to rule them all: the ping-pong cycle and piRNA-guided silencing.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 324-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). An important phenomenon found in more than one small RNA pathway is that of signal amplification by feedforward processes, whereby a secondary wave of RNAs is generated as a consequence of the action of the initial subset. An example of this is the production of secondary siRNAs from primary siRNAs by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRPs) in C. elegans and plants (Pak and Fire, 2007Pak J. Fire A. Distinct populations of primary and secondary effectors during RNAi in C. elegans.Science. 2007; 315: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, Sijen et al., 2007Sijen T. Steiner F.A. Thijssen K.L. Plasterk R.H.A. Secondary siRNAs result from unprimed RNA synthesis and form a distinct class.Science. 2007; 315: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Another such process is the so-called “ping-pong” mechanism for the generation of secondary piRNAs (Brennecke et al., 2007Brennecke J. Aravin A.A. Stark A. Dus M. Kellis M. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J.

Cell. 2008; 31: 785-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Here, a secondary wave of transposon-targeting RNAs is generated as a result of piRNA cleavage of transcribed transposons, ensuring that a large pool of piRNAs is generated which precisely match the target sequence. DNA deletion is a widespread phenomenon in most organisms. On the genome-wide level, it occurs in a precisely programmed, controlled way in a wide variety of organisms. Examples include the removal during development of germline-specific DNA in ciliates and certain parasitic nematodes and the removal of an entire chromosome in a wide variety of organisms including certain insects, birds, and mammals (Wang and Davis, 2014Wang J. Davis R.E. Programmed DNA elimination in multicellular organisms.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2014; 27: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). DNA deletion also occurs in a programmed, but less precisely determined way in the immune system of jawed vertebrates, where V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination involve the rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (Dudley et al., 2005Dudley D.D. Chaudhuri J. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Mechanism and control of V(D)J recombination versus class switch recombination: similarities and differences.in: Alt F.W. Advances in Immunology. Academic Press, 2005: 43-112Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Deletion of genomic regions is of course also associated with various genetic diseases as well as cancer, where deletions and rearrangements are commonplace and in many cases are believed to drive oncogenesis. An extreme example is that of chromothripsis, whereby an entire chromosome or region of a chromosome is shattered in a single catastrophic event and then re-ligated in an apparently random order, often with the loss of chromosomal regions (Stephens et al., 2011Stephens P.J. Greenman C.D. Fu B. Yang F. Bignell G.R. Mudie L.J. Pleasance E.D. Lau K.W. Beare D. Stebbings L.A. et al.Massive genomic rearrangement acquired in a single catastrophic event during cancer development.Cell. 2011; 144: 27-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that genomic deletions in a cell are generally only identified when associated with disease. It is thus possible that DNA deletion in healthy cells occurs at a higher frequency than thought. All of these examples involve the initiation of double-stranded DNA breaks and the ligation of the resulting ends via one of a number of DNA repair pathways. In the case of programmed DNA deletion, the Ligase IV-dependent non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway is frequently used. While much work has been done to determine the breakpoint initiation processes and the mechanisms for dsDNA breakpoint repair, not much is known about what happens to the pieces of excised DNA after they are removed from the genome. It is assumed in most cases that they are degraded and lost to the cell, but this is not known with certainty. In some cases, however, it is clear that deleted DNA is maintained apart from the genome and transcribed. An example is the so-called “double-minute chromosomes” that have been identified in some cancers that have undergone chromothripsis (Stephens et al., 2011Stephens P.J. Greenman C.D. Fu B. Yang F. Bignell G.R. Mudie L.J. Pleasance E.D. Lau K.W. Beare D.

Northcott P.A. et al.Genome sequencing of pediatric medulloblastoma links catastrophic DNA rearrangements with TP53 mutations.Cell. 2012; 148: 59-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Here, fragments of broken chromosomes are ligated and circularized and can be maintained as oncogene-producing units. Paramecium tetraurelia is a species of ciliate: single-celled organisms that separate their germline from their soma by way of nuclear dimorphism. Each individual contains both a germline nucleus, kept transcriptionally silent, and a somatic nucleus that is transcriptionally active and highly polyploid. The germline nucleus contains transposons, repeats and other parasitic DNA elements, while in the somatic nucleus all such unwanted elements are removed (Jahn and Klobutcher, 2002Jahn C.L. Klobutcher L.A. Genome remodeling in ciliated protozoa.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 489-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). During the sexual reproductive phase of the ciliate life cycle, a new somatic nucleus is generated from a meiotic product of the germline nucleus. In Paramecium, development of a new somatic nucleus involves the highly precise deletion of tens of thousands of parasitic DNA elements, known as internal eliminated sequences (IESs). These sequences, derived from ancient transposons, are excised by a domesticated piggyBac-like transposase called PiggyMac (Baudry et al., 2009Baudry C. Malinsky S. Restituito M. Kapusta A. Rosa S. Meyer E. Bétermier M. PiggyMac, a domesticated piggyBac transposase involved in programmed genome rearrangements in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2478-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because the excisase is expressed by the host, IESs have been free to evolve to very short lengths, with the shortest being only 26 bp in length. The removal of IESs depends on two classes of Piwi-interacting small RNAs, which target their complementary sequences for deletion. The first class of Piwi-interacting RNAs are known as scan RNAs (scnRNAs). scnRNAs are generated via a germline genome-wide transcription event in early development and are then sorted in the maternal somatic nucleus so that genome-matching RNAs are degraded and only IES-matching RNAs remain. These IES-matching scnRNAs then target their complementary sequences for excision in the newly developing somatic nucleus. Once excision has begun, the second class of Piwi-interacting RNAs is generated. These are termed iesRNAs, as they map exclusively to IESs, and they are between 26 and 31 nt in length (Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y. Swart E.C. Arambasic M. Nowacki M. Functional diversification of Dicer-like proteins and small RNAs required for genome sculpting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Due to the IES mapping, and to the fact that inhibition of IES excision leads to the loss of iesRNAs, it is believed that they are transcribed from IESs after excision. This would provide a means for amplifying the signal targeting IESs for excision, which might be necessary given that the DNA in the developing somatic nucleus is at the same time being amplified to high levels of polyploidy. The dual small RNA pathways in Paramecium development are thus reminiscent of the primary and secondary piRNA pathways in animals, whereby a first wave of general transposon-directed piRNAs initiates silencing, then leads to a second wave of piRNAs generated from the precise sequences that are being silenced. This both amplifies and specifies the silencing signal. The generation of iesRNAs has been a mystery due to the very short length of the supposed template. Here, we demonstrate that Paramecium has evolved a previously undescribed mechanism for transcribing short DNA pieces—their concatenation and circularization. The short transposon-derived IESs that are eliminated in the somatic nucleus have certain hallmarks that are related to their excision. They all contain a TA dinucleotide within an inverted repeat at either end. These TAs, one copy of which is excised and one retained in the genomic sequence, are necessary for the IESs’ recognition by the excision machinery. IESs also have end consensus sequences, thought to aid in their recognition, and exhibit an interesting length distribution (Arnaiz et al., 2012Arnaiz O. Mathy N. Baudry C. Malinsky S. Aury J.-M. Denby Wilkes C. Garnier O. Labadie K. Lauderdale B.E.

Genome-wide analysis of genetic and epigenetic control of programmed DNA deletion.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 8970-8983Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The shortest IESs, of 26–28 bp, form the largest group and then the distribution peaks every 10 bp with the exception of 36–38 bp. The current model for the excision of IESs is depicted in Figure 1A. The excisase PiggyMac cuts DNA with 4 nt 5′ overhangs centered on the TA repeat. The 5′-most nucleotide of the overhang is resected, and the ends are joined together at the TAs (Gratias and Bétermier, 2003Gratias A. Bétermier M. Processing of double-strand breaks is involved in the precise excision of paramecium internal eliminated sequences.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7152-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The missing nucleotide is then filled in and the ends are ligated with Ligase IV and Xrcc4 (Kapusta et al., 2011Kapusta A. Matsuda A. Marmignon A. Ku M. Silve A. Meyer E. Forney J.D. Malinsky S. Bétermier M. Highly precise and developmentally programmed genome assembly in Paramecium requires ligase IV-dependent end joining.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002049Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The production of iesRNAs is dependent on the excision of IESs, as is evident from the fact that silencing of proteins involved in IES excision prevents the production of iesRNAs (Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y. Swart E.C. Arambasic M. Nowacki M. Functional diversification of Dicer-like proteins and small RNAs required for genome sculpting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Maliszewska-Olejniczak et al., 2015Maliszewska-Olejniczak K. Gruchota J. Gromadka R. Denby Wilkes C.

TFIIS-dependent non-coding transcription regulates developmental genome rearrangements.PLoS Genet. 2015; 11: e1005383Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One explanation for this dependence is that the excised IESs act as a template for iesRNA transcription. Alternately, the transcription could occur pre-excision but be dependent on the assembly of the excisase complex on the DNA strands. We wished to determine whether excised IES DNA was sufficient in and of itself to initiate iesRNA production. To do this, regions of genomic DNA were identified whereby the IES end consensus inverted repeat of TATAG is separated by 27 nt, meaning that the locus has the length and sequence hallmarks of an IES, without being an IES. These loci were termed “cryptic IESs.” They are parts of genes or regulatory sequences and in normal cells are not excised during development. DNA oligonucleotides with 4 nt 5′ overhangs were designed and annealed to generate the theoretical excision product of these cryptic IESs. These oligonucleotides were injected into cells during the late stages of autogamy, at the point when iesRNAs are produced in the developing somatic nucleus. Cells were left to complete autogamy and go through four divisions before they were checked for excision by PCR using primers flanking the cryptic IES. PCR products were seen that correspond to amplified region following excision of a 27-bp segment (Figure 1B). These products were sent for sequencing that confirmed that the cryptic IES had been excised precisely, with one TA repeat left in the genome and one removed (Figure 1B). Three separate cryptic IESs of 27 nt were successfully excised following injection of DNA corresponding to their excision products. This supports the idea of a positive feedback loop, whereby excised transposon-like sequences trigger further excision of their own identical sequences. Co-injection of three cryptic IES oligonucleotides led to excision of all three in the same injected cells (Figure S1B). We named these cryptic IESs crypIESa, crypIESb, and crypIESc (see the Supplemental Information for sequences and primers). We wished to ascertain that the excision of cryptic IESs following oligonucleotide injection is due to the effect of iesRNAs. To do this, Dcl5 was silenced through RNAi-mediated gene knockdown by feeding (Beisson et al., 2010Beisson J. Bétermier M. Bré M.-H. Cohen J. Duharcourt S. Duret L. Kung C. Malinsky S. Meyer E. Preer J.R. et al.Silencing specific Paramecium tetraurelia genes by feeding double-stranded RNA.Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2010; 2010 (pdb.prot5363)Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Dcl5 is the Dicer-like protein responsible for iesRNA production, so if iesRNAs are required for DNA-induced cryptic IES excision, then Dcl5 silencing should abrogate this effect. Following Dcl5 silencing, cells were starved to initiate autogamy and injected with dsDNA corresponding to the excision product of crypIESb. As an injection control, 27 nt RNAs corresponding to the ends of the mating type IES were co-injected with the cryptic IES oligos. The mating type IES is only excised in mating type O cells and is retained in mating type E, with the excision or retention being epigenetically inherited (Singh et al., 2014Singh D.P. Saudemont B. Guglielmi G. Arnaiz O. Goût J.-F. Prajer M. Potekhin A. Przybòs E. Aubusson-Fleury A. Bhullar S. et al.Genome-defence small RNAs exapted for epigenetic mating-type inheritance.Nature. 2014; 509: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Injections were carried out in mating type E cells so that excision of the mating type IES was indicative of a successful injection. Dcl5 silencing will not affect excision following such an RNA injection, as the small RNAs are already present and thus do not need to be produced by Dcl5. Successful silencing of Dcl5 was confirmed by PCR to establish retention of IESs that require iesRNAs for their excision (Figure S1A). In control (unsilenced) cells, cryptic IES DNA injection was significantly more efficient at initiating excision than mating type (MT) RNA injection, with 13 successfully injected cells exhibiting crypIESb excision and only 5 cells exhibiting MT IES excision (Figure 1C). All cells that exhibited MT IES excision also exhibited crypIESb excision. In contrast, on Dcl5 silencing, the MT RNA injection was much more efficient at initiating excision than the cryptic IES DNA injection (Figure 1C). Very few injected cells excised the cryptic IES, and for those where excision occurred, the efficiency was low (Figure 1C). The silencing of Dcl5 thus has a strong effect on DNA-mediated cryptic IES excision, confirming that the excision occurs via the iesRNA pathway. The transcription of iesRNAs from excised IESs explains several observations, including the fact that iesRNAs map uniquely to IESs, are dependent on IES excision, and are only found in the developing somatic nucleus (Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y. Swart E.C. Arambasic M. Nowacki M. Functional diversification of Dicer-like proteins and small RNAs required for genome sculpting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, it poses serious problems for the transcription of the iesRNA template. As mentioned, the majority of IESs are <100 bp in length, and the length mode is 27 bp. If the iesRNA template is generated from these excised IESs, an RNA polymerase complex would have to assemble on these tiny fragments of DNA. RNA polymerase II has a footprint in the order of 30 nt (Brabant and Acheson, 1995Brabant F. Acheson N.H. RNA footprint mapping of RNA polymerase II molecules stalled in the intergenic region of polyomavirus DNA.J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4423-4430PubMed Google Scholar) that makes this impossible. Even if the polymerase responsible for iesRNA template transcription were capable of transcribing from such short molecules, there is a logistical problem with transcribing a complete iesRNA from an excised IES (see Figure 2A). iesRNAs have a 5′ UNG signature, with the 5′ U mapping to the nucleotide directly downstream of the TA repeat at the 5′ end of the IES (a T by consensus) (see Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y. Swart E.C. Arambasic M. Nowacki M. Functional diversification of Dicer-like proteins and small RNAs required for genome sculpting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). If the excised IES acts as a template for iesRNA transcription, then the polymerase will transcribe in a 5′-3′ direction from the lower strand. Due to the 4 nt 5′ overhangs, this strand does not contain the nucleotide that corresponds to the 5′ U in the iesRNA. Thus, there is a missing nucleotide in the hypothetical template. Mapping of iesRNAs demonstrates that this nucleotide is present in iesRNAs corresponding to the ends of IESs, which raises the question of how it is transcribed (Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y. Swart E.C. Arambasic M. Nowacki M. Functional diversification of Dicer-like proteins and small RNAs required for genome sculpting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is known that long IESs (over 200 nt) circularize following excision, with the 5′ most nucleotide being resected and then filled in upon ligation in a manner identical to that of the genomic DNA ends (Gratias et al., 2008Gratias A. Lepère G. Garnier O. Rosa S. Duharcourt S. Malinsky S. Meyer E. Bétermier M. Developmentally programmed DNA splicing in Paramecium reveals short-distance crosstalk between DNA cleavage sites.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3244-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This circularization would solve the problem of the missing templated nucleotide, as the circle junction would provide a complete template (see Figure 2A). Instead of having single-stranded 5′ overhangs whereby the antisense strand—from which transcription occurs—is missing, such circles would have complete double-stranded junctions with transcription possible from both strands. However, the shortest IESs are unable to form circles due to limits on the bending of the DNA double helix (Gratias and Bétermier, 2003Gratias A. Bétermier M. Processing of double-strand breaks is involved in the precise excision of paramecium internal eliminated sequences.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7152-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To investigate the dependence of the cryptic IES excision on the ends of the injected DNA, modified oligonucleotides with 4 nt 3′ overhangs were designed, annealed, and injected into autogamous cells. The cryptic IES in question had previously been successfully excised using dsDNA oligonucleotides with normal (4 nt 5′) overhangs. As an injection control, a second cryptic IES dsDNA oligonucleotide with 4 nt 5′ overhangs was co-injected with the modified oligonucleotide. Excision was seen for the control cryptic IES, but not for the 3′ overhang cryptic IES (Figure 1D). We hypothesized that the compatibility of the ends of the injected DNA was important for the formation of iesRNAs. The overhangs of the injected cryptic IES DNA are not complementary to each other (see Figures 1D and S1C), except at one end where a dimer could potentially form. Thus, they cannot ligate without prior end processing. In the normal situation, the 5′ most nucleotide from the 5′ overhang is removed, leaving a complementary TA on each overhang. The exonuclease responsible for this nucleotide removal can presumably only work in a 5′-3′ direction, meaning that the 3′ most nucleotide of the 3′ overhangs on the injected DNA will not be removed. To test whether complementary ends are necessary for iesRNA formation from injected DNA, modified dsDNA oligonucleotides with 3′ overhangs were injected, where the 3′ most nucleotide was replaced with an inosine nucleotide that can base pair with any other nucleotide. In two out of three injected cells, this injection led to efficient excision of the cryptic IES (Figure S1C). We conclude that complementarity of excised IES ends is an important factor in the formation of iesRNAs. If excised IESs are annealed via their 5′ overhangs in the same manner as the genomic DNA ends are ligated together, this provides a possible solution to the problem of the templating of the iesRNA template. Long dsDNA molecules could be formed from the annealing of multiple excised IESs and could thus provide a suitable template for an RNA polymerase to transcribe. The junctions, if annealed in the same way as the genomic DNA ends, could be read through by the polymerase and would solve the problem of the missing 5′ ribonucleotide template. One prediction from this model is that the Dcl5-mediated cleavage of the dsRNA template would be expected to occasionally produce iesRNAs that map across IES-IES junctions. To search for such RNAs, reads from a small RNA sequencing experiment were analyzed. The sequencing was carried out on Paramecium cells in the late stages of sexual development when iesRNAs are abundant (Sandoval et al., 2014Sandoval P.Y. Swart E.C. Arambasic M. Nowacki M. Functional diversification of Dicer-like proteins and small RNAs required for genome sculpting.Dev. Cell. 2014; 28: 174-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RNAs were identified that map partially to the ends of IESs with overhangs of at least 12 nt. The overhangs were then mapped to the Paramecium genome and IESs. The majority of such overhangs were found to map to the ends of other IESs (Figure 2B), which is what would be expected if IES ends are ligated together to form the template for iesRNA production. Many overhangs mapped inside IESs, but the majority of these were also found to map to other IES ends. It is likely that the highly repetitive nature of IES sequences means that there is a fairly high chance that a 12 nt sequence will map in multiple locations within the ∼45,000 IESs in the genome. However, if the overhangs mapped randomly, then it would be expected that the number that mapped inside IESs would be much greater than the number that mapped at ends, as there are far more possibilities for the mapping of a random 12 nt sequence within a ≥27 nt sequence than at the ends. We thus conclude that iesRNAs mapping to IES-IES junctions are present at significant levels and reflect the presence of such junctions within the iesRNA template. We hypothesized that concatenated IESs form a template for iesRNA generation and wis"

Post-translational protein translocation in yeast requires both the Sec61 translocation channel, and a complex of four additional proteins: Sec63, Sec62, Sec71, and Sec72. The structure and function of these proteins are largely unknown. This pathway also requires the cytosolic Hsp70 protein Ssa1, but whether Ssa1 associates with the translocation machinery to target protein substrates to the membrane is unclear. Here, we use a combined structural and biochemical approach to explore the role of Sec71-Sec72 subcomplex in post-translational protein translocation. To this end, we report a crystal structure of the Sec71-Sec72 complex, which revealed that Sec72 contains a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain that is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by Sec71. We also determined the crystal structure of this TPR domain with a C-terminal peptide derived from Ssa1, which suggests how Sec72 interacts with full-length Ssa1. Surprisingly, Ssb1, a cytoplasmic Hsp70 that binds ribosome-associated nascent polypeptide chains, also binds to the TPR domain of Sec72, even though it lacks the TPR-binding C-terminal residues of Ssa1. We demonstrate that Ssb1 binds through its ATPase domain to the TPR domain, an interaction that leads to inhibition of nucleotide exchange.

In co-translational translocation, the translating ribosome is first targeted to the ER membrane by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (SR). Subsequently, the ribosome binds to the translocation channel, the Sec61 channel, and the growing polypeptide chain is transferred from the ribosome tunnel into the channel. In the absence of SRP or SR, yeast cells remain viable and the translocation of certain proteins, such as prepro-carboxypeptidase Y (ppCPY) and prepro-α factor (ppαF), is not affected (4Hann B.C. Walter P. The signal recognition particle in S. cerevisiae.Cell. 1991; 67: 131-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).

Sec72 is a peripheral membrane protein, whereas Sec71 is a single-spanning membrane protein with a C-terminal cytosolic domain (11Feldheim D. Schekman R.

The tetrameric complex is required for the initial binding of post-translational substrates (10Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Posttranslational protein transport in yeast reconstituted with a purified complex of Sec proteins and Kar2p.Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), as well as for their subsequent translocation across the ER membrane (10Panzner S.

Posttranslational protein transport in yeast reconstituted with a purified complex of Sec proteins and Kar2p.Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). How the individual components of the tetrameric complex participate in substrate recognition and regulate translocation through the Sec61 channel is poorly understood. The only established function of the complex is a role for the J-domain of Sec63; it activates the ATPase activity of Kar2 (BiP), a member of the Hsp70 family of ATPases in the ER lumen (16Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A. J proteins catalytically activate Hsp70 molecules to trap a wide range of peptide sequences.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Following ATP hydrolysis, Kar2 binds to the translocating polypeptide chain and prevents the backsliding of the chain into the cytosol (17Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. BiP acts as a molecular ratchet during posttranslational transport of prepro-α factor across the ER membrane.Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Early work has shown that the Ssa proteins, cytoplasmic Hsp70 proteins, are also required for post-translational translocation (18Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A.

Waters M.G. Blobel G. 70K heat shock related proteins stimulate protein translocation into microsomes.Nature. 1988; 332: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments demonstrated that Hsp70 and other cytoplasmic chaperones associate with a translocation substrate as soon as it is released from the ribosome (21Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Spontaneous release of cytosolic proteins from posttranslational substrates before their transport into the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All these proteins are lost when the substrate engages the Sec complex and inserts into the translocon. Photo-crosslinking experiments have shown that the substrate is then in contact with Sec62, Sec71, and Sec72 (21Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Spontaneous release of cytosolic proteins from posttranslational substrates before their transport into the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is not known whether these proteins can serve as the targeting site for Ssa1. Whether cytoplasmic Hsp70 itself acts as a targeting factor analogous to SRP is also uncertain. It could simply act as a chaperone, keeping substrates in an unfolded or loosely folded conformation, as has been demonstrated previously (18Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Functional interaction of cytosolic hsp70 and a DnaJ-related protein, Ydj1p, in protein translocation in vivo.Mol. Cell.

Waters M.G. Blobel G. 70K heat shock related proteins stimulate protein translocation into microsomes.Nature. 1988; 332: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), whereas targeting would occur exclusively by an interaction of the signal sequence with the Sec61 channel. Alternatively, Hsp70 could have a specific interaction with the Sec complex components and thus facilitate targeting. Previous data suggest that the targeting of post-translational substrate to the ER membrane can also occur co-translationally, that is, before completion of polypeptide synthesis (5Hansen W.

Principles of ER cotranslational translocation revealed by proximity-specific ribosome profiling.Science. 2014; 3461257521Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In addition, using proximity-specific ribosome profiling, it was demonstrated that Sec71 deletion affects the co-translational targeting of certain substrates to the ER membrane (22Jan C.H. Williams C.C. Weissman J.S. Principles of ER cotranslational translocation revealed by proximity-specific ribosome profiling.Science. 2014; 3461257521Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), even though there is no known mechanism for coordinating translation with recruitment of the translating ribosome to the Sec complex. One possibility is that ribosome-nascent chain complexes bind to the Sec complex through a direct interaction of the ribosome with Sec61. However, this seems unlikely, because the Sec complex, in contrast to the Sec61 channel in isolation, does not interact with ribosomes (10Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Posttranslational protein transport in yeast reconstituted with a purified complex of Sec proteins and Kar2p.Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that the targeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes is mediated by another factor. A possible candidate is Ssb1, a cytoplasmic Hsp70 that associates with ribosomes (23Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. The translation machinery and 70 kd heat shock protein cooperate in protein synthesis.Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 24Peisker K.

Acta. 2010; 1803: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and interacts with nascent chains. Binding of nascent chains to Ssb1 and the ER targeting factor SRP appears to be mutually exclusive (25Willmund F. del Alamo M. Pechmann S. Chen T. Albanèse V. Dammer E.B. Peng J. Frydman J. The cotranslational function of ribosome-associated Hsp70 in eukaryotic protein homeostasis.Cell. 2013; 152: 196-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Ssb1, like the Sec complex, participates in the SRP-independent pathway and can serve as an early sorting factor for ribosome-bound nascent chains. However, it is unknown whether Ssb1 has a specific affinity for any of the components of the translocation machinery. It is likely that structural characterization of the Sec complex or its subcomplexes will be important for unraveling the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins mediate post-translational translocation. However, with the exception of a 21-Å low-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Sec complex (26Harada Y. Li H. Wall J.S. Li H. Lennarz W.J. Structural studies and the assembly of the heptameric post-translational translocon complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2956-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), no structural information is currently available. Here, we report the first structure of a constituent of the Sec complex, the Sec71-Sec72 subcomplex. The structure shows that Sec72 contains a TPR domain that is tethered to the ER membrane by Sec71. We also determined the crystal structure of the TPR domain bound to the C terminus of Ssa1, which suggests how full-length Ssa1 interacts with Sec72. Furthermore, the structure revealed a previously unappreciated variability in the mode of chaperone binding to TPR domains. We demonstrate that the TPR domain of Sec72 also binds the ATPase domain of Ssb1 and inhibits its nucleotide exchange activity. Mutagenesis shows that both binding interfaces, Sec72-Ssa1 and Sec72-Ssb1, play a role in protein translocation. Taken together, our results suggest that translocation substrates can be recruited to the Sec71-Sec72 subcomplex either post-translationally through Ssa1 or co-translationally through Ssb1. We reasoned that Sec71 and Sec72 may form a subcomplex of the tetrameric complex (Sec63, Sec62, Sec72, and Sec71) because Sec72 is required for the integration of Sec71 into the tetrameric complex (11Feldheim D. Schekman R. Sec72p contributes to the selective recognition of signal peptides by the secretory polypeptide translocation complex.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Sec71 is essential for the stability of Sec72 in vivo (11Feldheim D. Schekman R. Sec72p contributes to the selective recognition of signal peptides by the secretory polypeptide translocation complex.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Given that both Sec71 and Sec72 have domains that are primarily exposed to the cytosol, the N-terminal transmembrane segment of Sec71 is likely not required for the interaction between the two proteins. We therefore expressed Sec71 from Chaetomium thermophilum without its transmembrane segment (Sec71f) together with full-length Sec72 from the same species (Fig. 1a). The complex was expressed in Escherichia coli cells and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography, using an N-terminal His7-tag on Sec71, followed by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The size of the complex in gel filtration and the relative intensity of the two bands in Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels indicate that the assembly consists of one polypeptide each of Sec71f and Sec72 (Fig. 1a). The data also demonstrate that the cytosolic domain of Sec71 (Sec71f) is sufficient to bind Sec72. The 1:1 stoichiometry is confirmed by the crystal structure of the complex, determined at 3.0-Å resolution (Fig. 1b). Sec71f contains three α-helices, with the N-terminal two helices forming “the base” of Sec71. Given that the N terminus is preceded in the full-length protein by the transmembrane segment, we postulate that these helices are proximal to the membrane. The third helix points away from the base and serves as the anchor for Sec72. This helix is followed by an extended loop that is stabilized by crystal contacts. Sec72 consists of an N-terminal domain that interacts with the base of Sec71 and a C-terminal TPR domain. The TPR domain consists of three sets of helix-loop-helix motifs (TPR1–3) and a C-terminal stabilizing helix (Fig. 1c). The convex surface of the TPR domain interacts with the third helix of Sec71, leaving the concave surface unoccupied. This surface is generally the binding site for ligands in TPR domain-containing proteins. In Sec72, it is positively charged (Fig. 1d), similarly to the TPR domains in Hop, Tom71, and Unc45, which all interact with the negatively charged C termini of chaperones (27Scheufler C. Brinker A.

These features raise the possibility that the TPR domain of Sec72 also interacts with the negatively charged C terminus of a chaperone. To test whether cytoplasmic chaperones interact with the Sec71-Sec72 complex, we incubated His7-tagged complex with untagged Ssa1, Sse1, Hsc82, or Hsp104. After binding to Ni-NTA resin, the bound material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Binding was observed for Ssa1, whereas the other chaperones showed little or no interaction (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, Hsc82 (S. cerevisiae Hsp90) has the same four C-terminal amino acids as Ssa1 (EEVD). It is likely that upstream residues of the Hsp90 sequence, in particular a Met residue, interfere with the interaction in a similar manner as observed with the Hsp70-interacting TPR domain of the Hop protein (27Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I.

To test whether the TPR domain of Sec72 is responsible for the interaction with Ssa1, we performed gel filtration experiments with purified proteins (Fig. 2b). Indeed, a population of the two proteins co-eluted, the low percentage likely reflecting a weak interaction between the two proteins. Determination of the binding constant by microscale thermophoresis gave an apparent binding constant of ˜55 μm (Fig. 2c). We next tested whether Ssa1 binds the TPR domain of Sec72 via its C termini, akin to that seen for Hsp70 binding to other TPR domains such as Hop, Tom71, and Unc45 (27Scheufler C. Brinker A.

A GST fusion of the C-terminal lid domain of Ssa1 interacted with the TPR domain (Fig. 2d), whereas a construct lacking the last 14 amino acids did not bind (Fig. 2e). These results support the idea that the C terminus of Ssa1 interacts with the TPR domain of Sec72. Weak binding between TPR domains and an Hsp70 partner have also been reported for many other cases (18–230 μm) (27Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U.

To further characterize the interaction between the C terminus of Ssa1 and the TPR domain, we attempted co-crystallization of the Sec71-Sec72 complex or of the TPR domain with a synthetic C-terminal Ssa1 peptide, or soaking of Sec71-Sec72 crystals with the peptide. However, the resulting structures lacked bound peptide, likely because the interaction was weak. To facilitate binding, we therefore fused a C-terminal peptide of Ssa1 (HDNDGPTVEEVD) to the TPR domain of Sec72, both derived from C. thermophilum. The fusion protein indeed crystallized, and its structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined to a resolution of 2.87 Å. Eight copies of the fusion protein were located in the asymmetric unit, but they did not differ significantly (root mean standard deviation (r.m.s.d.) 0.35–0.5 Å). In addition, the structure of the TPR domain was essentially the same as in the Sec71-Sec72 structure determined without peptide (r.m.s.d. 0.36Å, supplemental Fig. S1). The only difference is in the orientation of Lys-159. In the Sec71-Sec72 structure, Lys-159 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp-193 of the stabilizing helix, whereas in the Sec72-Ssa1 peptide fusion protein structure, it reorients and contacts the terminal Asp-226 of the Ssa1 peptide. In agreement with our prediction, the negatively charged C terminus of Ssa1 (PTVEEVD) sits in the positively charged pocket formed by the concave surface of the TPR domain. Most of the preceding residues of Ssa1 are invisible, suggesting that they are flexible and do not perturb the binding of the C-terminal tail. The TPR domain forms a two-carboxylate clamp that holds the terminal Asp-226 of the PTVEEVD sequence in place. Asp-226 forms extensive hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with conserved residues in TPR1, TPR2, and TPR3, including Arg-80, Asn-84, Asn-128, and Lys-159 (Fig. 3a). In addition, side chains of Glu-223 and Thr-221 (corresponding to the underlined residues in the PTVEEVD sequence) contact TPR2 through Gln-135 and Gln-131 and the stabilizing helix through Asp-193, respectively (Fig. 3a). The backbone of the Ssa1 peptide also engages in polar contacts with residues Asn-128, Arg-163, Tyr-87, and Arg-80 of the TPR domain (Fig. 3a). In contrast to Hsp70 protein Ssa1, in Hsp90 protein, a Glu residue replaces Thr-221 at the corresponding position, providing another explanation why Sec72 is specific for Hsp70. The TPR domain of Sec72 is structurally similar to the TPR domains of Hop and Tom71 (27Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I.

Here we report ABL1 germline variants cosegregating with an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by congenital heart disease, skeletal abnormalities, and failure to thrive. The variant c.734A>G (p.Tyr245Cys) was found to occur de novo or cosegregate with disease in five individuals (families 1-3). Additionally, a de novo c.1066G>A (p.Ala356Thr) variant was identified in a sixth individual (family 4). We overexpressed the mutant constructs in HEK 293T cells and observed increased tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting increased ABL1 kinase activities associated with both the p.Tyr245Cys and p.Ala356Thr substitutions. Our clinical and experimental findings, together with previously reported teratogenic effects of selective BCR-ABL inhibitors in humans and developmental defects in Abl1 knockout mice, suggest that ABL1 has an important role during organismal development."

However, little is known about how Reelin controls the cytoskeleton during neuronal migration. Here, we identify CLASP2 as a key cytoskeletal effector in the Reelin signaling pathway. We demonstrate that CLASP2 has distinct roles during neocortical development regulating neuron production and controlling neuron migration, polarity, and morphogenesis. We found downregulation of CLASP2 in migrating neurons leads to mislocalized cells in deeper cortical layers, abnormal positioning of the centrosome-Golgi complex, and aberrant length/orientation of the leading process. We discovered that Reelin regulates several phosphorylation sites within the positively charged serine/arginine-rich region that constitute consensus GSK3β phosphorylation motifs of CLASP2. Furthermore, phosphorylation of CLASP2 regulates its interaction with the Reelin adaptor Dab1 and this association is required for CLASP2 effects on neurite extension and motility. Together, our data reveal that CLASP2 is an essential Reelin effector orchestrating cytoskeleton dynamics during brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2593702837,"The biogenesis and maintenance of cell organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts require the import of many proteins from the cytosol, a process that is controlled by phosphorylation. In the case of chloroplasts, the import of hundreds of different proteins depends on translocons at the outer and inner chloroplast membrane (TOC and TIC, respectively) complexes. The essential protein TOC159 functions thereby as an import receptor. It has an N-terminal acidic (A-) domain that extends into the cytosol, controls receptor specificity, and is highly phosphorylated in vivo However, kinases that phosphorylate the TOC159 A-domain to enable protein import have remained elusive. Here, using co-purification with TOC159 from Arabidopsis, we discovered a novel component of the chloroplast import machinery, the regulatory kinase at the outer chloroplast membrane 1 (KOC1). We found that KOC1 is an integral membrane protein facing the cytosol and stably associates with TOC. Moreover, KOC1 phosphorylated the A-domain of TOC159 in vitro, and in mutant koc1 chloroplasts, preprotein import efficiency was diminished. koc1 Arabidopsis seedlings had reduced survival rates after transfer from the dark to the light in which protein import into plastids is required to rapidly complete chloroplast biogenesis. In summary, our data indicate that KOC1 is a functional component of the TOC machinery that phosphorylates import receptors, supports preprotein import, and contributes to efficient chloroplast biogenesis."

KCNQ2/3 channel activity is augmented in vivo by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is generated from myo-inositol, an osmolyte transported into cells by sodium-dependent myo-inositol transporters (SMITs). Here, we discovered that KCNQ2/3 channels isoform-specifically colocalize with SMIT1 and SMIT2 at sciatic nerve nodes of Ranvier and in axon initial segments, and form channel–transporter complexes in vitro and in vivo. KCNQ2/3 coexpression protected SMIT1 activity from the otherwise inhibitory effects of cellular depolarization imposed by elevating extracellular [K+], and KCNQ2 was required for potentiation of SMIT activity by myo-inositol preincubation. Cytoskeletal disruption, which speeds PIP2 dispersion, attenuated potentiation of KCNQ2/3 currents by SMIT1-mediated myo-inositol uptake, suggesting close channel–transporter juxtaposition ensures KCNQ2/3 exposure to locally high myo-inositol-derived PIP2 concentrations. Thus, KCNQ2/3-SMIT1/2 coassembly permits cross talk via physical interaction, and may also be required for optimal, reciprocal indirect regulation via membrane potential and PIP2, especially within the specialized architecture of axons.—Neverisky, D.

The exosome is a large molecular machine involved in RNA degradation and processing. Here we address how the trimeric Rrp4 cap enhances the activity of the archaeal enzyme complex. Using methyl-TROSY NMR methods we identified a 50-Å long RNA binding path on each Rrp4 protomer. We show that the Rrp4 cap can thus simultaneously recruit three substrates, one of which is degraded in the core while the others are positioned for subsequent degradation rounds. The local interaction energy between the substrate and the Rrp4–exosome increases from the periphery of the complex toward the active sites. Notably, the intrinsic interaction strength between the cap and the substrate is weakened as soon as substrates enter the catalytic barrel, which provides a means to reduce friction during substrate movements toward the active sites. Our data thus reveal a sophisticated exosome–substrate interaction mechanism that enables efficient RNA degradation."

Storm events and periods of heavy rainfall and runoff can result in increased microbiological contaminants in raw water. Surface water supplies are open to the environment and runoff can directly influence the presence of contaminants. A time-stratified bi-directional case-crossover study design was used to estimate associations of heavy rainfall and hospitalizations for GI. Cases of GI were identified as in-patient hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of infectious disease associated diarrhea [ICD-9 codes: specified gastrointestinal infections 001–009.9 or diarrhea 787.91] among the residents of New Jersey from 2009 to 2013 resulting in a final sample size of 47,527 cases. Two control days were selected on the same days of the week as the case day, within fixed 21-day strata. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios controlling for temperature and humidity. To determine potential effect modification estimates were stratified by season (warm or cold) and drinking water source (groundwater, surface water, or ‘other’ category). Stratified analyses by drinking water source and season identified positive associations of rainfall and GI hospitalizations in surface water systems during the warm season with no lag (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.05–1.19) and a 2-day lag (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.03–1.16). Positive associations in ‘Other’ water source areas (served by very small community water systems, private wells, or unknown) during the warm season with a 4-day lag were also found. However, there were no statistically significant positive associations in groundwater systems during the warm season. The results suggest that water systems with surface water sources can play an important role in preventing GI hospitalizations during and immediately following heavy rainfall. Regulators should work with water system providers to develop system specific prevention techniques to limit the impact of heavy rainfall on public health."

Growing evidences support the use of multiclade immunization approaches (11Klasse P.J. LaBranche C.C. Ketas T.J. Ozorowski G. Cupo A. Pugach P. Ringe R.P. Golabek M. van Gils M.J. Guttman M. Lee K.K.

Sequential and simultaneous immunization of rabbits with HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein SOSIP.664 trimers from clades A, B and C.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12e1005864Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, to overcome HIV-1 diversity, there is a need to increase the repertoire of Env-based immunogens across different subtypes by designing clade-specific immunogens based on regional prevalence of a particular subtype for structural and immunogenicity studies (12Mann J.K. Ndung'u T. HIV-1 vaccine immunogen design strategies.Virol. J. 2015; 12: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Currently multipronged approaches are being pursued to design HIV-1 Env immunogens. A well documented strategy to enhance expression, decrease aggregation, and increase structural homogeneity is to truncate the env sequence before the membrane proximal external region at amino acid 664 and introduce six arginine (6R) residues at the furin cleavage site (REKR). A disulfide linkage between residue 501 of gp120 and 605 of gp41 (SOS) stabilizes the trimeric conformation, whereas the isoleucine to proline substitution (I559P) in the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region stabilizes the Env in its prefusion state (13Sanders R.W.

Envs expressed from this construct are known as SOSIP.664 Envs. Other strategies include adding a foldon-like trimeric motif at the C terminus of gp41 (14Ringe R.P. Yasmeen A. Ozorowski G. Go E.P.

Among the several Envs of different subtypes, which have been stabilized by using the strategies mentioned above, the soluble, native-like trimeric clade A Env, BG505.SOSIP.664, is the best characterized Env (17Julien J.P.

The clade C subtype of HIV-1 is the most prevalent with more than 50% coverage worldwide and remains the major circulating strain in India, Brazil, China, and parts of Africa. We focused our effort on designing an immunogen with our previously identified membrane-bound efficiently cleaved clade C Env, 4-2.J41, of Indian origin. This envelope was of particular interest to us as it binds efficiently to bNAbs but poorly to non-NAbs when expressed on the cell surface (19Boliar S. Das S. Bansal M. Shukla B.N. Patil S. Shrivastava T. Samal S. Goswami S. King C.R. Bhattacharya J. Chakrabarti B.K.

Variations in autologous neutralization and CD4 dependence of b12 resistant HIV-1 clade C env clones obtained at different time points from antiretroviral naive Indian patients with recent infection.Retrovirology. 2010; 7: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Using this Env, we envisaged that by priming with either plasmid DNA or vectors expressing efficiently cleaved membrane-bound Env followed by soluble native-like protein boost, we could improve on the quality and the durability of the immune response in immunized animals (21Chakrabarti B.K. Feng Y. Sharma S.K. McKee K. Karlsson Hedestam G.B. Labranche C.C. Montefiori D.C. Mascola J.R. Wyatt R.T.

Virol. 2008; 82: 7369-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here, we have stabilized a soluble form of 4-2.J41 Env by swapping the gp41 region from BG505.SOSIP.664 Env into 4–2.J41.SOSIP.664 Env, which otherwise does not form a stable native-like trimer. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and negative stain electron microscopy (NS-EM) data have confirmed that the trimers are homogenous, stable, and well ordered displaying a 3-lobed architecture resembling the native HIV-1 spike. Furthermore, biolayer light interferometry (BLI)-based analysis for binding to antibodies have shown that the purified Env binds efficiently to bNAbs and poorly to non-NAbs. Besides, the stability of the trimer at physiological temperature and its high melting temperature makes it a suitable candidate immunogen for testing for prime-boost immunization studies and also for structural analysis. The Indian clade C Env 4-2.J41 is naturally and efficiently cleaved into gp120 and gp41 when expressed on the cell surface and preferentially binds to bNAbs (19Boliar S. Das S. Bansal M. Shukla B.N. Patil S. Shrivastava T. Samal S. Goswami S. King C.R. Bhattacharya J. Chakrabarti B.K. An efficiently cleaved HIV-1 clade C Env selectively binds to neutralizing antibodies.PloS One. 2015; 10e0122443Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The availability of this Env provided us with the opportunity to modify this protein into a soluble and native-like trimeric form. The introduction of mutations to form 4-2.J41.SOSIP.664 Env failed to produce the desired result. Therefore, we chose to manipulate the N-terminal region of gp41 to test whether this region contributes to the stability of the protein (23Dey A.K. David K.B. Klasse P.J. Moore J.P. Specific amino acids in the N-terminus of the gp41 ectodomain contribute to the stabilization of a soluble, cleaved gp140 envelope glycoprotein from human immunodeficiency virus type 1.Virology. 2007; 360: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although high resolution crystal and cryo-EM structures of BG505.SOSIP.664 Env are available, the HR1 region is disordered in most structures (17Julien J.P. Cupo A. Sok D. Stanfield R.L. Lyumkis D.

The diffused electron density of the HR1 region of BG505 and JRFL Envs in two instances allows to trace the atomic coordinates and build-up the side chain rotamers with some degree of confidence (3Garces F.

As it was not clear which region of gp41 determines the stability of BG505, we designed three constructs by swapping the DNA sequence coding for the amino acids in gp41 region of BG505 Env to 4-2.J41 Env as described under “Experimental procedures.” The protein forms for the constructs mentioned above were represented as: 4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) Env, 4-2.J41.HR2(BG505) Env, and 4–2.J41.HR1(BG505)Env. Hence, this strategy enabled us to design Envs that displays the clade-specific epitopes in gp120 region of 4-2.J41 Env (Fig. 1A). The sequence alignment of the gp41 region between BG505.SOSIP.664 Env and 4-2.J41.SOSIP.664 Env shows that there is a difference of 21 amino acids in that region (Fig. 1B). To screen for the presence of well ordered, native-like trimers, 293F cells were transfected with each of the env constructs along with the plasmid expressing cellular protease, furin. The expressed proteins were individually tested for binding to a select panel of bNAbs and non-NAbs. The expressed Envs were immunoprecipitated (IP) followed by Western blot analysis with clade C-specific anti-gp120 antibody (15Sharma S.K. de Val N. Bale S. Guenaga J. Tran K. Feng Y. Dubrovskaya V.

Cleavage-independent HIV-1 Env trimers engineered as soluble native spike mimetics for vaccine design.Cell Rep. 2015; 11: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The antibodies tested included CD4-bs-directed bNAbs (VRC01 and VRC06), glycan-specific bNAb (PGT121), quaternary conformation dependent bNAb (PGT145), quaternary conformation and cleavage-specific bNAb (PGT151), and quaternary preferring and glycan-dependent bNAb (PG9). Initial screening showed that the full gp41-swapped Env, 4-2.J41.gp41(BG505), and HR1-swapped Env, 4-2.J41.HR1(BG505), were readily recognized by bNAbs VRC01, PGT121, PG9, PGT145, and PGT151 but not by non-NAbs (Fig. 1C). However, the 4-2.J41.HR2(BG505) Env bound to non-NAbs such as F105, b6, A32, C11, and 447–452D (data not shown). It is to be noted that none of the Envs expressed from these constructs recognized the monoclonal antibody, VRC06. This result is in concurrence with a previous study where clade C Env 16055 isolated from a plasma sample of an Indian patient failed to bind VRC06 (26Guenaga J. de Val N. Tran K. Feng Y. Satchwell K. Ward A.B. Wyatt R.T. Well-ordered trimeric HIV-1 subtype B and C soluble spike mimetics generated by negative selection display native-like properties.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11e1004570Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The antibody directed to CD4-induced (CD4i) conformation, 17b recognized the Envs expressed from all three constructs. The presence of bands corresponding to the Envs in Western blot analysis post-IP with bNAbs that target quaternary structure-specific epitopes of 4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) and 4-2.J41.HR1(BG505) Envs, suggested that the recombinant 4-2.J41.SOSIP.664 Env could be stabilized by swapping either the gp41 subunit or the HR1 region of BG505 Env to 4-2.J41 Env. After the initial screening by IP and Western blot, the 4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) and 4-2.J41.HR1(BG505) Envs were purified by lectin-affinity (Galanthus nivalis) column followed by SEC. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) was used to assess the presence of trimeric Env in the purified sample and the quality of the trimer was confirmed by NS-EM. The SEC profile showed a nice single peak, which eluted at ∼55 ml from a Superdex 200 16/60 column for both 4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) and 4-2.J41.HR1(BG505) Envs that corresponds to the elution volume for such trimeric Envs. From the eluent the trimeric Env resolved as a discrete band in BN-PAGE and separated into gp120 and gp41 components in the presence of reducing agent, indicating effective furin cleavage of the SOSIP trimers (Fig. 2A). However, under NS-EM, the 4-2.J41.HR1(BG505) Env was found to consist of a heterogeneous mixture of open trimer, some dimers, and closed compact native-like trimers, indicating that the single peak in SEC was associated with aberrant trimers and dimers that could not be resolved by SEC. On the other hand 4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) Env appeared more homogenous with >90% trimers that were 3-lobed propeller-shaped, closed, compact, and native-like as assessed by visual inspection when compared with NS-EM image of BG505.SOSIP.664 Env trimers (Fig. 2B). Thus, 4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) Env could be purified to homogeneity by a simple purification protocol, but a more stringent purification protocol was required for 4-2.J41.HR1(BG505) Env involving positive or negative Ab-affinity selection (26Guenaga J. de Val N. Tran K. Feng Y. Satchwell K. Ward A.B. Wyatt R.T. Well-ordered trimeric HIV-1 subtype B and C soluble spike mimetics generated by negative selection display native-like properties.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11e1004570Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on yield and quality of the proteins, we chose to further characterize the 4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) Env. Due to structural flexibility, the soluble form of Env frequently adopts a relatively open conformation exposing epitopes for CD4-induced antibodies leading to a transition from closed “compact” to labile “open” conformation. The CD4 mediates such transition by exposing V3 and bridging sheet epitopes and makes the immunogen less desirable. A double cysteine mutant (I201C/A433C) reported previously prevents CD4 from triggering and preferentially blocks access to CD4-induced non-neutralizing antibody epitopes (18Kwon Y.D. Pancera M. Acharya P. Georgiev I.S. Crooks E.T. Gorman J. Joyce M.G. Guttman M. Ma X. Narpala S. Soto C. Terry D.S. Yang Y. Zhou T.

Biol. 2015; 22: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). When the same double cysteine mutant was introduced in 4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) Env, the mutant Env, DC4-2.J41.gp41(BG505), was unable to bind to bridging sheet-directed antibodies, such as 17b and V3 epitope-directed antibody 447-52D. The Env, DC4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) was incubated with an increasing concentration of soluble CD4 (sCD4) followed by IP with either 447-52D or 17b. A 20 m excess of sCD4 was needed to expose the V3 and bridging sheet epitopes in DC4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) Env in comparison to 4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) Env (Fig. 3). The increased band intensity for 4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) Env with increasing concentrations of sCD4 suggested that more and more molecules adopted an open conformation in the presence of sCD4. The binding kinetics of the DC4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) Env with antibodies was determined by BLI. Recognition of this Env by bNAbs such as PG9, PGT145, PGT151, and PGT121 that are dependent on quaternary conformation was assessed and the Env bound to all these antibodies with high affinity (Fig. 4, upper panel). It is to be noted that the bNAb, PG9 (27Walker L.M. Phogat S.K. Chan-Hui P.Y. Wagner D. Phung P. Goss J.L. Wrin T. Simek M.D. Fling S. Mitcham J.L. Lehrman J.K. Priddy F.H. Olsen O.A. Frey S.M. Hammond P.W. et al.Broad and potent neutralizing antibodies from an African donor reveal a new HIV-1 vaccine target.Science. 2009; 326: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar), is a conformation-dependent antibody, which asymmetrically interacts with the V1/V2 loop of two protomers of a native trimeric Env. The contact regions primarily include the glycan at Asn-160 and Asn-156 and residue Lys-168 of one protomer and glycans Asn-160 and Asn-197 (V3 loop) of the adjacent protomer (28McLellan J.S.

Another quaternary-specific, trimer-selective conformational antibody, PGT145 binds to the high mannose glycan-dependent moieties at the trimer apex (V2 loop) (30Walker L.M. Huber M. Doores K.J.

Fling S. et al.Broad neutralization coverage of HIV by multiple highly potent antibodies.Nature. 2011; 477: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). As PG9 and PGT145 bind only one site per trimer and are not subject to avidity gain, it helped us to calculate the affinities for these trimer-preferring bNAbs after performing binding kinetics by BLI. The calculated affinity for PG9 and PGT145 are in the nanomolar range (KD for PG9, 13 nm; KD for PGT145, 2 nm). These results suggested that the designed envelope is trimeric and native-like in conformation with appropriately placed glycans at positions Asn-160, Asn-156, and Asn-173 that are hallmarks of nanomolar affinity to PG9 and PGT145. The trimer and cleavage-specific bNAb PGT151 (31Falkowska E. Le K.M. Ramos A. Doores K.J. Lee J.H. Blattner C. Ramirez A. Derking R. van Gils M.J. Liang C.H. Mcbride R. von Bredow B. Shivatare S.S.

The DC4-2.J41.gp41(BG505) Env trimer bound strongly to PGT151 with a fast on-rate, which was comparable with PG9. A very slow dissociation curve suggested that the purified Env not only forms native-like trimers but also was properly cleaved and maintained quaternary structure. The bNAb, PGT121 that recognizes the Asn-332 supersite bound with a fast on-rate but with no dissociation, and in fact secondary association was seen during wash, indicating very tight binding. Therefore the dissociation constant could not be calculated. Another critical feature of a native-like Env is not to expose the epitopes for non-NAbs (33Yasmeen A. Ringe R. Derking R. Cupo A.

https://openalex.org/W2591972979,"Mast cells are critical actors of hypersensitivity type I (allergic) reactions by the release of vasoactive and proinflammatory mediators following their activation by aggregation of the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcεRI). We have previously identified Phospholipid Scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) as a new molecular intermediate of FcεRI signaling that amplifies degranulation of the rat mast cell line RBL-2H3. Here we characterized primary mast cells from Plscr1-/- mice. The absence of PLSCR1 expression did not impact mast cell differentiation as evidenced by unaltered FcεRI expression, general morphology, amount of histamine stored and expression of FcεRI signal effector molecules. No detectable mast cell deficiency was observed in Plscr1-/- adult mice. In dose-response and time-course experiments, primary cultures of mast cells (bone marrow-derived mast cells and peritoneal cell-derived mast cells) generated from Plscr1-/- mice exhibited a reduced release of β-hexosaminidase upon FcεRI engagement as compared to their wild-type counterparts. In vivo, Plscr1-/- mice were protected in a model of passive systemic anaphylaxis when compared to wild-type mice, which was consistent with an observed decrease in the amounts of histamine released in the serum of Plscr1-/- mice during the reaction. Therefore, PLSCR1 aggravates anaphylactic reactions by increasing FcεRI-dependent mast cell degranulation. PLSCR1 could be a new therapeutic target in allergy."
https://openalex.org/W2591860688,"NHE3 directly binds Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) family scaffolding proteins that are required for many aspects of NHE3 regulation. The NHERFs bind both to an internal region (amino acids 586-660) of the NHE3 C terminus and to the NHE3 C-terminal four amino acids. The internal NHERF-binding region contains both putative Class I (-592SAV-) and Class II (-595CLDM-) PDZ-binding motifs (PBMs). Point mutagenesis showed that only the Class II motif contributes to NHERF binding. In this study, the roles in regulation of NHE3 activity of these two PBMs were investigated, revealing the following findings. 1) Interaction occurred between these binding sites because mutation of either removed nearly all NHERF binding. 2) Mutations in either significantly reduced basal NHE3 activity. Total and percent plasma membrane (PM) NHE3 protein expression was reduced in the C-terminal but not in the internal PBD mutation. 3) cGMP- and Ca2+-mediated inhibition of NHE3 was impaired in both the internal and the C-terminal PBM mutations. 4) There was a significant reduction in half-life of the PM pool of NHE3 in only the internal PBM mutation but no change in total NHE3 half-life in either. 5) There were some differences in NHE3-associating proteins in the two PBM mutations. In conclusion, NHE3 binds to NHERF proteins via both an internal Class II PBM and C-terminal Class I PBM, which interact. The former determines NHE3 stability in the PM, and the latter determines total expression and percent PM expression."
