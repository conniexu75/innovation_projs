https://openalex.org/W3006650868,"The heterogeneity of endothelial cells (ECs) across tissues remains incompletely inventoried. We constructed an atlas of >32,000 single-EC transcriptomes from 11 mouse tissues and identified 78 EC subclusters, including Aqp7+ intestinal capillaries and angiogenic ECs in healthy tissues. ECs from brain/testis, liver/spleen, small intestine/colon, and skeletal muscle/heart pairwise expressed partially overlapping marker genes. Arterial, venous, and lymphatic ECs shared more markers in more tissues than did heterogeneous capillary ECs. ECs from different vascular beds (arteries, capillaries, veins, lymphatics) exhibited transcriptome similarity across tissues, but the tissue (rather than the vessel) type contributed to the EC heterogeneity. Metabolic transcriptome analysis revealed a similar tissue-grouping phenomenon of ECs and heterogeneous metabolic gene signatures in ECs between tissues and between vascular beds within a single tissue in a tissue-type-dependent pattern. The EC atlas taxonomy enabled identification of EC subclusters in public scRNA-seq datasets and provides a powerful discovery tool and resource value."

https://openalex.org/W3006211741,"We undertook a comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of 95 prospectively collected endometrial carcinomas, comprising 83 endometrioid and 12 serous tumors. This analysis revealed possible new consequences of perturbations to the p53 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, identified a potential role for circRNAs in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and provided new information about proteomic markers of clinical and genomic tumor subgroups, including relationships to known druggable pathways. An extensive genome-wide acetylation survey yielded insights into regulatory mechanisms linking Wnt signaling and histone acetylation. We also characterized aspects of the tumor immune landscape, including immunogenic alterations, neoantigens, common cancer/testis antigens, and the immune microenvironment, all of which can inform immunotherapy decisions. Collectively, our multi-omic analyses provide a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians, identify new molecular associations of potential mechanistic significance in the development of endometrial cancers, and suggest novel approaches for identifying potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W3005961896,"Immune responses in diverse tissue sites are critical for protective immunity and homeostasis. Here, we investigate how tissue localization regulates the development and function of human natural killer (NK) cells, innate lymphocytes important for anti-viral and tumor immunity. Integrating high-dimensional analysis of NK cells from blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissue sites from 60 individuals, we identify tissue-specific patterns of NK cell subset distribution, maturation, and function maintained across age and between individuals. Mature and terminally differentiated NK cells with enhanced effector function predominate in blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lungs and exhibit shared transcriptional programs across sites. By contrast, precursor and immature NK cells with reduced effector capacity populate lymph nodes and intestines and exhibit tissue-resident signatures and site-specific adaptations. Together, our results reveal anatomic control of NK cell development and maintenance as tissue-resident populations, whereas mature, terminally differentiated subsets mediate immunosurveillance through diverse peripheral sites. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W3006529112,"The cerebral vasculature is a dense network of arteries, capillaries, and veins. Quantifying variations of the vascular organization across individuals, brain regions, or disease models is challenging. We used immunolabeling and tissue clearing to image the vascular network of adult mouse brains and developed a pipeline to segment terabyte-sized multichannel images from light sheet microscopy, enabling the construction, analysis, and visualization of vascular graphs composed of over 100 million vessel segments. We generated datasets from over 20 mouse brains, with labeled arteries, veins, and capillaries according to their anatomical regions. We characterized the organization of the vascular network across brain regions, highlighting local adaptations and functional correlates. We propose a classification of cortical regions based on the vascular topology. Finally, we analysed brain-wide rearrangements of the vasculature in animal models of congenital deafness and ischemic stroke, revealing that vascular plasticity and remodeling adopt diverging rules in different models."
https://openalex.org/W3005867992,"<h2>Summary</h2> Optical tissue transparency permits scalable cellular and molecular investigation of complex tissues in 3D. Adult human organs are particularly challenging to render transparent because of the accumulation of dense and sturdy molecules in decades-aged tissues. To overcome these challenges, we developed SHANEL, a method based on a new tissue permeabilization approach to clear and label stiff human organs. We used SHANEL to render the intact adult human brain and kidney transparent and perform 3D histology with antibodies and dyes in centimeters-depth. Thereby, we revealed structural details of the intact human eye, human thyroid, human kidney, and transgenic pig pancreas at the cellular resolution. Furthermore, we developed a deep learning pipeline to analyze millions of cells in cleared human brain tissues within hours with standard lab computers. Overall, SHANEL is a robust and unbiased technology to chart the cellular and molecular architecture of large intact mammalian organs."
https://openalex.org/W3005917863,"Multicomponent reactions are relied on in both academic and industrial synthetic organic chemistry owing to their step- and atom-economy advantages over traditional synthetic sequences1. Recently, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) motifs have become valuable as pharmaceutical bioisosteres of benzene rings, and in particular 1,3-disubstituted BCP moieties have become widely adopted in medicinal chemistry as para-phenyl ring replacements2. These structures are often generated from [1.1.1]propellane via opening of the internal C–C bond through the addition of either radicals or metal-based nucleophiles3–13. The resulting propellane-addition adducts are then transformed to the requisite polysubstituted BCP compounds via a range of synthetic sequences that traditionally involve multiple chemical steps. Although this approach has been effective so far, a multicomponent reaction that enables single-step access to complex and diverse polysubstituted drug-like BCP products would be more time efficient compared to current stepwise approaches. Here we report a one-step three-component radical coupling of [1.1.1]propellane to afford diverse functionalized bicyclopentanes using various radical precursors and heteroatom nucleophiles via a metallaphotoredox catalysis protocol. This copper-mediated reaction operates on short timescales (five minutes to one hour) across multiple (more than ten) nucleophile classes and can accommodate a diverse array of radical precursors, including those that generate alkyl, α-acyl, trifluoromethyl and sulfonyl radicals. This method has been used to rapidly prepare BCP analogues of known pharmaceuticals, one of which is substantially more metabolically stable than its commercial progenitor. A one-step, three-component radical coupling of [1.1.1]propellane by a photoredox reaction mediated by a copper catalyst produces drug-like bicyclopentanes."
https://openalex.org/W3005905327,"In many repeat diseases, such as Huntington's disease (HD), ongoing repeat expansions in affected tissues contribute to disease onset, progression and severity. Inducing contractions of expanded repeats by exogenous agents is not yet possible. Traditional approaches would target proteins driving repeat mutations. Here we report a compound, naphthyridine-azaquinolone (NA), that specifically binds slipped-CAG DNA intermediates of expansion mutations, a previously unsuspected target. NA efficiently induces repeat contractions in HD patient cells as well as en masse contractions in medium spiny neurons of HD mouse striatum. Contractions are specific for the expanded allele, independently of DNA replication, require transcription across the coding CTG strand and arise by blocking repair of CAG slip-outs. NA-induced contractions depend on active expansions driven by MutSβ. NA injections in HD mouse striatum reduce mutant HTT protein aggregates, a biomarker of HD pathogenesis and severity. Repeat-structure-specific DNA ligands are a novel avenue to contract expanded repeats."
https://openalex.org/W3006297827,"Summary The metabolic requirements of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) change with their cell cycle activity. However, the underlying role of mitochondria remains ill-defined. Here we found that, after mitochondrial activation with replication, HSCs irreversibly remodel the mitochondrial network and that this network is not repaired after HSC re-entry into quiescence, contrary to hematopoietic progenitors. HSCs keep and accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria through asymmetric segregation during active division. Mechanistically, mitochondria aggregate and depolarize after stress because of loss of activity of the mitochondrial fission regulator Drp1 onto mitochondria. Genetic and pharmacological studies indicate that inactivation of Drp1 causes loss of HSC regenerative potential while maintaining HSC quiescence. Molecularly, HSCs carrying dysfunctional mitochondria can re-enter quiescence but fail to synchronize the transcriptional control of core cell cycle and metabolic components in subsequent division. Thus, loss of fidelity of mitochondrial morphology and segregation is one type of HSC divisional memory and drives HSC attrition."

Corneal staining, tear break up time (TBUT) and tear secretion were evaluated. Bacterial genomic 16s rRNA from stool samples were analyzed. Main outcomes were microbiome compositional differences among groups and their correlation to dry eye signs.Gut microbiome analysis revealed significant compositional differences in SS compared to controls and DES. In phylum, Bacteriodetes increased, while Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and Actinobacteria decreased (p<0.05). In genus, Bifidobacterium was reduced (vs controls; p = 0.025, vs DES; p = 0.026). Beta diversity of SS also showed significant distances from controls and DES (p = 0.007 and 0.019, respectively). SS showed decreased genus of Blautia (p = 0.041), Dorea (p = 0.025) and Agathobacter (p = 0.035) compared to controls and increased genus of Prevotella (p = 0.026), Odoribacter (p = 0.028) and Alistipes (p = 0.46) compared to DES. On the other hand, DES only had increased genus Veillonella (p = 0.045) and reduced Subdoligranulum (p = 0.035) compared to controls. Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Bifidobacterium were significantly related with dry eye signs (p<0.05). After adjustment of age, gender and group classification, multivariate linear regression analysis revealed tear secretion was strongly affected by Prevotella (p = 0.025). With additional adjustment of hydroxychloroquine use, TBUT was markedly affected by Prevotella (p = 0.037) and Actinobacteria (p = 0.001).Sjögren's syndrome showed significant gut dysbiosis compared to controls and environmental dry eye syndrome, while dry eye patients showed compositional changes of gut microbiome somewhere in between Sjögren's syndrome and controls. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota was partly correlated to dry eye severity."
https://openalex.org/W3006098530,"Genetic studies have revealed that autoimmune susceptibility variants are over-represented in memory CD4+ T cell regulatory elements1-3. Understanding how genetic variation affects gene expression in different T cell physiological states is essential for deciphering genetic mechanisms of autoimmunity4,5. Here, we characterized the dynamics of genetic regulatory effects at eight time points during memory CD4+ T cell activation with high-depth RNA-seq in healthy individuals. We discovered widespread, dynamic allele-specific expression across the genome, where the balance of alleles changes over time. These genes were enriched fourfold within autoimmune loci. We found pervasive dynamic regulatory effects within six HLA genes. HLA-DQB1 alleles had one of three distinct transcriptional regulatory programs. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing we demonstrated that a promoter variant is causal for T cell-specific control of HLA-DQB1 expression. Our study shows that genetic variation in cis-regulatory elements affects gene expression in a manner dependent on lymphocyte activation status, contributing to the interindividual complexity of immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W3006566616,"Hepatic fibrosis occurs during chronic hepatic injury and is involved in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activated by several types of immune cells. Among the immune cells, hepatic macrophages and their crosstalk with HSCs play a vital role in all stages of hepatic fibrosis. Exosomes, which are 30-150 nm lipid bilayer vehicles, can transfer specific lipid, nucleic acids, proteins, and other bioactive molecules. Exosomes can act as good communication between macrophages and HSCs. Herein, we investigated the role of exosomes between THP-1 macrophage and HSCs in the progression of liver fibrosis. Exosomes originating from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated THP-1 macrophages promoted HSCs proliferation and induced the increased expression of fibrotic genes. LPS could alter the miRNA profile in exosomes secreted from THP-1 macrophages. The changed miR-103-3p in exosomes could promote HSCs proliferation and activation by targeting Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and it plays important roles in the crosstalk between THP-1 macrophages and HSCs during the progression of liver fibrosis. Moreover, miR-103-3p in serum exosomes from liver fibrosis patients could be a biomarker for liver fibrosis. Therefore, exosomes may have important roles in the crosstalk between macrophage and HSCs in the progression of chronic liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3006523404,"Pathogenic autoantibodies arise in many autoimmune diseases, but it is not understood how the cells making them evade immune checkpoints. Here, single-cell multi-omics analysis demonstrates a shared mechanism with lymphoid malignancy in the formation of public rheumatoid factor autoantibodies responsible for mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. By combining single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing with serum antibody peptide sequencing and antibody synthesis, rare circulating B lymphocytes making pathogenic autoantibodies were found to comprise clonal trees accumulating mutations. Lymphoma driver mutations in genes regulating B cell proliferation and V(D)J mutation (CARD11, TNFAIP3, CCND3, ID3, BTG2, and KLHL6) were present in rogue B cells producing the pathogenic autoantibody. Antibody V(D)J mutations conferred pathogenicity by causing the antigen-bound autoantibodies to undergo phase transition to insoluble aggregates at lower temperatures. These results reveal a pre-neoplastic stage in human lymphomagenesis and a cascade of somatic mutations leading to an iconic pathogenic autoantibody."
https://openalex.org/W3005654419,"Non-centrosomal microtubule-organizing centres (ncMTOCs) have a variety of roles that are presumed to serve the diverse functions of the range of cell types in which they are found. ncMTOCs are diverse in their composition, subcellular localization and function. Here we report a perinuclear MTOC in Drosophila fat body cells that is anchored by the Nesprin homologue Msp300 at the cytoplasmic surface of the nucleus. Msp300 recruits the microtubule minus-end protein Patronin, a calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein (CAMSAP) homologue, which functions redundantly with Ninein to further recruit the microtubule polymerase Msps—a member of the XMAP215 family—to assemble non-centrosomal microtubules and does so independently of the widespread microtubule nucleation factor γ-Tubulin. Functionally, the fat body ncMTOC and the radial microtubule arrays that it organizes are essential for nuclear positioning and for secretion of basement membrane components via retrograde dynein-dependent endosomal trafficking that restricts plasma membrane growth. Together, this study identifies a perinuclear ncMTOC with unique architecture that regulates microtubules, serving vital functions. Zheng et al. discover a type of perinuclear microtubule-organizing center, which is assembled by multiple factors and regulates retrograde endosomal trafficking and plasma membrane growth."
https://openalex.org/W3006501016,"Dopaminergic neurons (DAns), generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), are capable of functionally integrating following transplantation and have recently advanced to clinical trials for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, pre-clinical studies have highlighted the low proportion of DAns within hPSC-derived grafts and their inferior plasticity compared to fetal tissue. Here, we examined whether delivery of a developmentally critical protein, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), could improve graft outcomes. We tracked the response of DAns implanted into either a GDNF-rich environment or after a delay in exposure. Early GDNF promoted survival and plasticity of non-DAns, leading to enhanced motor recovery in PD rats. Delayed exposure to GDNF promoted functional recovery through increases in DAn specification, DAn plasticity, and DA metabolism. Transcriptional profiling revealed a role for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling downstream of GDNF. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of neurotrophic gene therapy strategies to improve hPSC graft outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3005541452,"<h2>Summary</h2> The most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in <i>C9orf72</i> (C9-HRE). While RNA and dipeptide repeats produced by C9-HRE disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport, the proteins that become redistributed remain unknown. Here, we utilized subcellular fractionation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and identified 126 proteins, enriched for protein translation and RNA metabolism pathways, which collectively drive a shift toward a more cytosolic proteome in C9-HRE cells. Among these was eRF1, which regulates translation termination and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). eRF1 accumulates within elaborate nuclear envelope invaginations in patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons and postmortem tissue and mediates a protective shift from protein translation to NMD-dependent mRNA degradation. Overexpression of eRF1 and the NMD driver UPF1 ameliorate C9-HRE toxicity <i>in vivo</i>. Our findings provide a resource for proteome-wide nucleocytoplasmic alterations across neurodegeneration-associated repeat expansion mutations and highlight eRF1 and NMD as therapeutic targets in <i>C9orf72</i>-associated ALS and/or FTD."
https://openalex.org/W3006072263,"The neurotoxicity of hard metal-based nanoparticles (NPs) remains poorly understood. Here, we deployed the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y differentiated or not into dopaminergic- and cholinergic-like neurons to study the impact of tungsten carbide (WC) NPs, WC NPs sintered with cobalt (Co), or Co NPs versus soluble CoCl2. Co NPs and Co salt triggered a dose-dependent cytotoxicity with an increase in cytosolic calcium, lipid peroxidation, and depletion of glutathione (GSH). Co NPs and Co salt also suppressed glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) mRNA and protein expression. Co-exposed cells were rescued by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of GSH, and partially by liproxstatin-1, an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, in silico analyses predicted a significant correlation, based on similarities in gene expression profiles, between Co-containing NPs and Parkinson's disease, and changes in the expression of selected genes were validated by RT-PCR. Finally, experiments using primary human dopaminergic neurons demonstrated cytotoxicity and GSH depletion in response to Co NPs and CoCl2 with loss of axonal integrity. Overall, these data point to a marked neurotoxic potential of Co-based but not WC NPs and show that neuronal cell death may occur through a ferroptosis-like mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3005808962,"Despite efforts to visualize the spatio–temporal dynamics of single messenger RNAs, the ability to precisely control their function has lagged. This study presents an optogenetic approach for manipulating the localization and translation of specific mRNAs by trapping them in clusters. This clustering greatly amplified reporter signals, enabling endogenous RNA–protein interactions to be clearly visualized in single cells. Functionally, this sequestration reduced the ability of mRNAs to access ribosomes, markedly attenuating protein synthesis. A spatio–temporally resolved analysis indicated that sequestration of endogenous β-actin mRNA attenuated cell motility through the regulation of focal-adhesion dynamics. These results suggest a mechanism highlighting the indispensable role of newly synthesized β-actin protein for efficient cell migration. This platform may be broadly applicable for use in investigating the spatio–temporal activities of specific mRNAs in various biological processes. Kim et al. develop an optogenetic visualization approach that can rapidly and reversibly trap messenger RNA molecules in protein clusters, thereby restricting their access to ribosomes and dampening translation efficiency."

https://openalex.org/W3005841925,"Abstract The oncogene epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is frequently expressed in glioblastomas (GBM) but its impact on therapy response is still under controversial debate. Here we wanted to test if EGFRvIII influences the sensitivity towards the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the survival of 336 GBM patients, demonstrating that under standard treatment, which includes TMZ, EGFRvIII expression is associated with prolonged survival, but only in patients with O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) promoter methylated tumors. Using isogenic GBM cell lines with endogenous EGFRvIII expression we could demonstrate that EGFRvIII increases TMZ sensitivity and results in enhanced numbers of DNA double-strand breaks and a pronounced S/G2-phase arrest after TMZ treatment. We observed a higher expression of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in EGFRvIII+ cells and patient tumor samples, which was most pronounced for MSH2 and MSH6. EGFRvIII-specific knockdown reduced MMR protein expression thereby increasing TMZ resistance. Subsequent functional kinome profiling revealed an increased activation of p38- and ERK1/2-dependent signaling in EGFRvIII expressing cells, which regulates MMR protein expression downstream of EGFRvIII. In summary, our results demonstrate that the oncoprotein EGFRvIII sensitizes a fraction of GBM to current standard of care treatment through the upregulation of DNA MMR."
https://openalex.org/W3006173183,"The Bcl-xL apoptosis inhibitor plays a major role in vertebrate development. In addition to its effect on apoptosis, Bcl-xL is also involved in cell migration and mitochondrial metabolism. These effects may favour the onset and dissemination of metastasis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully understood. Here we focus on the control of cell migration by Bcl-xL in the context of breast cancer cells. We show that Bcl-xL silencing led to migration defects in Hs578T and MDA-MB231 cells. These defects were rescued by re-expressing mitochondria-addressed, but not endoplasmic reticulum-addressed, Bcl-xL. The use of BH3 mimetics, such as ABT-737 and WEHI-539 confirmed that the effect of Bcl-xL on migration did not depend on interactions with BH3-containing death accelerators such as Bax or BH3-only proteins. In contrast, the use of a BH4 peptide that disrupts the Bcl-xL/VDAC1 complex supports that Bcl-xL by acting on VDAC1 permeability contributes to cell migration through the promotion of reactive oxygen species production by the electron transport chain. Collectively our data highlight the key role of Bcl-xL at the interface between cell metabolism, cell death, and cell migration, thus exposing the VDAC1/Bcl-xL interaction as a promising target for anti-tumour therapy in the context of metastatic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3005598796,"Abstract Chronic inflammation has been linked to promotion of tumorigenesis and metastasis in lung. However, due to lack of a relevant animal model for characterization, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Lung tumor suppressor gene Gprc5a -knockout (ko) mice are susceptible to lung inflammation, tumorigenesis and metastasis, which resembles the pathological features in human patients. Here, we showed that PTGES/PGE 2 signaling was highly associated with lung tumorigenesis and metastasis in Gprc5a -ko mice. Interestingly, Ptges-knockout in mouse lung tumor cells, although reduced their stemness and EMT-like features, still formed tumors and lung metastasis in immune-deficient nude mice, but not in immune-competent mice. This suggests that the major role of PTGES/PGE 2 signaling in tumorigenicity and lung metastasis is through immunosuppression. Mechanistically, PTGES/PGE 2 signaling intrinsically endows tumor cells resistant to T-cell cytotoxicity, and induces cytokines extrinsically for MDSC recruitment, which is crucial for suppression of T-cell immunity. Importantly, targeting PGE 2 signaling in Gprc5a -ko mice by PTGES inhibitor suppressed MDSC recruitment, restored T cells, and significantly repressed lung metastasis. Thus, PTGES/PGE 2 signaling links immunosuppression and metastasis in an inflammatory lung microenvironment of Gprc5a -ko mouse model."

Osteoblast proliferation, migration, and survival are pivotal during this process. In this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of the regulatory role of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 during osteoblast proliferation, migration, and survival. We searched the gene expression omnibus databases and LncBase Experimental V.2 to identify key microRNAs (miRNAs) targets of KCNQ1OT1. MiR-701-3p was selected as a differentially expressed miRNA and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to verify its interaction with KCNQ1OT1. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) was also identified as a target of miR-701-3p. We further identified KCNQ1OT1 as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-701-3p that could influence osteoblast proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that the KCNQ1OT1/miR-701-3p/FGFR3 axis is an important regulator of osteoblast proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, and provide a new therapeutic avenue for fracture healing."

https://openalex.org/W3005566067,"Background Progressive keratoconus can lead to severely impaired vision, but there is currently no consensus on the definition of progressive disease. Errors in the measurement of the parameters commonly used to establish progressive disease were evaluated in an attempt to determine the limits at which a true change in the values can be detected. The possible association between measurement error and disease severity was also investigated to evaluate the need for limits based on disease severity. Methods Sixty-one eyes were studied in 61 patients with keratoconus. Four replicate measurements were made in each patient using a Scheimpflug-based tomographic system (denoted the PC) and an auto-keratometer (denoted the AK). The repeatability coefficient, i.e., the level below which differences between two measurements are found in 95% of paired observations, was calculated. Patients were further divided into three groups based on disease severity (parameter magnitude). Results Increasing magnitude of all the keratometric parameters investigated was significantly associated with increasing measurement errors, and thus worse repeatability. The maximum keratometry value (Kmax) was the least repeatable parameter (1.23 D, 95% CI 1.11–1.35 D) and showed the strongest association between parameter magnitude and measurement error. The repeatability coefficient ranged between 0.32 and 1.62 D, depending on disease severity. The most repeatable parameter was the flattest central keratometry value (K1), measured with the PC (0.51 D, 95% CI 0.46–0.56 D) and the AK (0.54 D, 95% CI 0.48–0.59 D). K1 showed the weakest association between parameter magnitude and measurement error. The repeatability coefficient for K1 ranged between 0.40 and 0.54 D when using the PC, and between 0.34 and 0.70 D when using the AK in the three groups. Conclusions The association between the magnitude of the keratometric parameters and their measurement errors suggests that limits should be based on disease severity to ensure reliable detection of progressive keratoconus. Further studies are, however, required."
https://openalex.org/W3006563130,"Sex determination is a pivotal step in forensic and bioarchaeological fields. Generally, scholars focus on metric or qualitative morphological features, but in the last few years several contributions have applied geometric-morphometric (GM) techniques to overcome limitations of traditional approaches. In this study, we explore sexual dimorphism in modern human tali from three early 20th century populations (Sassari and Bologna, Italy; New York, USA) at intra- and interspecific population levels using geometric morphometric (GM) methods. Statistical analyses were performed using shape, form, and size variables. Our results do not show significant differences in shape between males and females, either considering the pooled sample or the individual populations. Differences in talar morphology due to sexual dimorphism are mainly related to allometry, i.e. size-related changes of morphological traits. Discriminant function analysis using form space Principal Components and centroid size correctly classify between 87.7% and 97.2% of the individuals. The result is similar using the pooled sample or the individual population, except for a diminished outcome for the New York group (from 73.9% to 78.2%). Finally, a talus from the Bologna sample (not included in the previous analysis) with known sex was selected to run a virtual resection, followed by two digital reconstructions based on the mean shape of both the pooled sample and the Bologna sample, respectively. The reconstructed talus was correctly classified with a Ppost between 99.9% and 100%, demonstrating that GM is a valuable tool to cope with fragmentary tali, which is a common occurrence in forensic and bioarchaeological contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3006455792,"TP53 mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with poor prognosis. Since no targeted therapy is available to restore p53 function, it is of great interest to test whether other pathways activated by TP53 mutations can be therapeutically targeted. Here, we showed HIF-1α target genes are enriched in TP53-mutated versus TP53-wild-type AML. To determine the role of this activation, we tested efficacy of HIF-1α inhibitor echinomycin in TP53-mutated AML samples in vitro and in vivo. Echinomycin was broadly effective against a panel of primary AML blast cells, with low nanomolar IC50s and, based on colony-forming unit assay, was tenfold more effective in eliminating AML stem cells. Echinomycin selectively eliminated CD34+CD38− AML cells. To test the therapeutic efficacy of echinomycin, we established a xenograft model of TP53-mutated AML. Echinomycin was broadly effective against xenografts from multiple AML samples in vivo, and more effective than cytarabine + daunorubicin chemotherapy. Importantly, while cytarabine + daunorubicin enriched for AML stem cells, echinomycin nearly eliminated this population. Using TP53-mutated AML cell line THP1 and patient-derived AML cells, we tested a new echinomycin formulation with longer half-life and significantly improved therapeutic effect. Our data suggest a novel approach to treat AML with TP53 mutations."

Induced sputum and blood obtained within 24 hrs of admission were examined via PCR, immunofluorescence and culture to detect 17 bacteria/viruses. A designated radiologist read the chest radiographs.Three hundred patients with a mean (SD) age of 14 (±15) months old were recruited. Significant pathogens were detected in 62% of patients (n = 186).

It has been suggested that Pol I–associated factors facilitate chromatin transcription, but it is unknown whether Pol I has an intrinsic capacity to transcribe through nucleosomes. Here, we used in vitro transcription assays to study purified WT and mutant Pol I variants from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and compare their abilities to pass a nucleosomal barrier with those of yeast Pol II and Pol III. Under identical conditions, purified Pol I and Pol III, but not Pol II, could transcribe nucleosomal templates. Pol I mutants lacking either the heterodimeric subunit Rpa34.5/Rpa49 or the C-terminal part of the specific subunit Rpa12.2 showed a lower processivity on naked DNA templates, which was even more reduced in the presence of a nucleosome. Our findings suggest that the lobe-binding subunits Rpa34.5/Rpa49 and Rpa12.2 facilitate passage through nucleosomes, suggesting possible cooperation among these subunits. We discuss the contribution of Pol I–specific subunit domains to efficient Pol I passage through nucleosomes in the context of transcription rate and processivity.

The molecular nature of their specialization is presently the subject of intensive investigations (for reviews, see Refs. 1Khatter H. Vorländer M.K. Müller C.W.

In most eukaryotes, RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcribes only one gene locus, the multicopy rRNA genes. Even in exponentially growing cells, only a fraction of the more than 100 copies of rRNA genes are transcribed (4Dammann R. Lucchini R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Chromatin structures and transcription of rDNA in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21 (8506130): 2331-233810.1093/nar/21.10.2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). More than 100 transcribing Pol I molecules can be packed on one rRNA gene (5Miller Jr., O.L. Beatty B.R. Visualization of nucleolar genes.Science. 1969; 164 (5813982): 955-95710.1126/science.164.3882.955Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 6Osheim Y.N. French S.L. Sikes M.L. Beyer A.L.

The dense packing of elongating Pol I molecules is probably not compatible with a regular nucleosomal structure. In agreement with this, most nucleosomes are depleted from transcribed rRNA genes, resulting in an open chromatin structure at transcribed rRNA genes (7Conconi A. Widmer R.M. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Two different chromatin structures coexist in ribosomal RNA genes throughout the cell cycle.Cell. 1989; 57 (2720786): 753-76110.1016/0092-8674(89)90790-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 8Merz K.

The balance between the transcriptionally active (open) and nucleosomal (closed) rRNA chromatin states is due to a dynamic equilibrium of transcription-dependent removal and replication-dependent assembly of nucleosomes (9Wittner M. Hamperl S. Stöckl U. Seufert W. Tschochner H. Milkereit P. Griesenbeck J. Establishment and maintenance of alternative chromatin states at a multicopy gene locus.Cell. 2011; 145 (21565613): 543-55410.1016/j.cell.2011.03.051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although it was shown that Pol I transcription is needed to establish the open chromatin structure, it is still unclear how nucleosomal barriers affect Pol I transcription and whether components of the basal Pol I machinery support chromatin transcription. Along this line, it is possible that Pol I subunits influence transcription of nucleosomal templates. RNA polymerase polymerase lobe-binding module amino acids nucleotides tandem winged helix core factor. Whereas knowledge about Pol I transcription of nucleosomal templates is rather sparse, transcription of nucleosomal templates by purified RNA polymerase II was studied in molecular detail (for reviews, see Refs. 10Venkatesh S. Workman J.L. Histone exchange, chromatin structure and the regulation of transcription.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Several factors were described to act on nucleosomes to modulate the barrier and facilitate Pol II passage (for a review, see Ref. 10Venkatesh S. Workman J.L. Histone exchange, chromatin structure and the regulation of transcription.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 (25650798): 178-18910.1038/nrm3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). One of them, FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription), was also suggested to support Pol I transcription through nucleosomes (13Birch J.L. Tan B.C. Panov K.I. Panova T.B. Andersen J.S. Owen-Hughes T.A. Russell J. Lee S.C. Zomerdijk J.C.

Other Pol II–associated factors are able to reduce intrinsic stalling of Pol II on chromatin templates, thereby reducing the amount and rate of backtracked and arrested enzymes (for a review, see Ref. 11Teves S.S. Weber C.M. Henikoff S. Transcribing through the nucleosome.Trends Biochem.

Among these factors are the Pol II transcription factors TFIIF and TFIIS, which are structurally and functionally related to the heterodimeric Pol I subunit Rpa34.5/Rpa49 and subunit Rpa12.2, respectively (14Kuhn C.D.

Interplay between the Pol II factors TFIIF and the RNA cleavage factor TFIIS was reported to promote transcript elongation and increase transcription through nucleosomes in a synergistic manner (17Schweikhard V.

Whether the Pol I counterparts play a role in nucleosomal transcription remains to be elucidated. The heterodimer Rpa34.5/Rpa49 of Pol I corresponds to Rpc37/Rpc53 of Pol III (3Engel C. Neyer S. Cramer P. Distinct mechanisms of transcription initiation by RNA polymerases I and II.Annu. Rev.

The heterodimer Rpa34.5/Rpa49 consists of three subdomains: a dimerization module formed by Rpa34.5 and the N-terminal part of Rpa49 (full-length Rpa34.5 and amino acids (aa) 1–110 of Rpa49), the A49 linker (aa 105–187 of Rpa49), and the C-terminal part of Rpa49 (aa 187–415, hereafter called Rpa49CT). The dimerization module binds to the “lobe” and “external” domains of the second largest Pol I subunit Rpa135 on the core module side (15Jennebach S. Herzog F. Aebersold R. Cramer P.

The lobe-associated N-terminal domain of Rpa12.2 is important for proper Pol I assembly, whereas the C-terminal domain supports RNA cleavage. To obtain insight into whether and how the lobe-associated subunits influence transcription of nucleosomal templates, we analyzed the function of the Rpa34.5/Rpa49 heterodimer and Rpa12.2 using defined promoter-dependent and -independent in vitro transcription systems. We studied effects of suboptimal transcription conditions for Pol I to pass a nucleosome and compared purified Pol I with Pol II and Pol III in nucleosomal transcription. Our investigations emphasize the roles of Rpa49LCT (containing the linker and the tWH domain of Rpa49 (i.e. aa 105–415)) and Rpa12CT for assuring Pol I transcription through an in vitro assembled nucleosome. In contrast to Pol I and Pol III, the lb-module is absent in Pol II. The lb-module of Pol I and Pol III is formed by subunits Rpa34.5/Rpa49 and Rpa12.2 and subunits Rpc37/Rpc53 and Rpc11, respectively. It was previously published that purified Pol III can transcribe through a nucleosome (37Studitsky V.M. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Felsenfeld G.

Furthermore, a synergistic positive effect of TFIIS and TFIIF on nucleosomal transcription by Pol II was reported (18Luse D.S. Spangler L.C. Újvári A. Efficient and rapid nucleosome traversal by RNA polymerase II depends on a combination of transcript elongation factors.J. Biol.

Interestingly, FACT supported as well Pol I transcription through nucleosomes (13Birch J.L. Tan B.C. Panov K.I. Panova T.B. Andersen J.S. Owen-Hughes T.A. Russell J. Lee S.C. Zomerdijk J.C.

Here, the three purified nuclear RNA polymerases from yeast were directly compared in their ability to transcribe nucleosomal templates. Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III were purified using the same one-step affinity purification procedure and identical buffers (42Merkl P. Perez-Fernandez J. Pilsl M. Reiter A. Williams L. Gerber J. Böhm M. Deutzmann R. Griesenbeck J. Milkereit P. Tschochner H.

Biol. 2014; 34 (25092870): 3817-382710.1128/MCB.00395-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The purified enzymes were free of detectable cross-contamination of transcription factors or RNA-synthesizing enzymes (42Merkl P. Perez-Fernandez J. Pilsl M. Reiter A. Williams L. Gerber J. Böhm M. Deutzmann R. Griesenbeck J. Milkereit P. Tschochner H.

Nucleosomes were assembled by salt dialysis at the 601 nucleosome-positioning sequence (43Lowary P.T. Widom J. New DNA sequence rules for high affinity binding to histone octamer and sequence-directed nucleosome positioning.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276 (9514715): 19-4210.1006/jmbi.1997.1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) on a tailed template carrying a 3′-single-stranded DNA overhang (see Fig. S1 and “Experimental procedures”). The use of tailed templates allowed promoter-independent transcription initiation by all three polymerases (42Merkl P. Perez-Fernandez J. Pilsl M. Reiter A. Williams L. Gerber J. Böhm M. Deutzmann R. Griesenbeck J. Milkereit P. Tschochner H. Binding of the termination factor nsi1 to its cognate DNA site is sufficient to terminate RNA polymerase I transcription in vitro and to induce termination in vivo.Mol. Cell.

For thorough quantification of the efficiency of RNA synthesis from a nucleosomal template, transcription reactions were performed in the presence of an additional nucleosome-free reference template, serving as an internal control. Transcription reactions were performed with a 7.5 nm concentration of the respective polymerases at identical salt concentrations (150 mm potassium acetate). All three polymerases were able to transcribe reference templates and/or the 601 sequence containing templates without nucleosomes quite efficiently (Fig. 1, lanes 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 15). Differences in signal intensities between the generated RNAs were due to the use of a universal buffer system that may not be ideal for all enzymes. The presence of a nucleosome on the DNA template reduced the efficiency of transcription. However, the level of inhibition differed significantly between the three polymerases. Whereas a major fraction of Pol I and Pol III could transcribe the nucleosomal 601 sequence (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 3, 11, and 13), full-length transcripts from nucleosomal templates were almost not detectable in Pol II–dependent reactions (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 8). Upon longer exposure times, additional smaller transcripts became visible in lane 6 (Fig. S2A). These smaller transcripts could be products of abortive or arrested transcription when Pol II encountered the nucleosome. This indicated that at least a minor fraction of Pol II initiated transcription from the nucleosome-decorated tailed template but was arrested or displaced upon collision with a nucleosome. Quantification revealed about 40% reduced RNA synthesis by Pol I and Pol III in the presence of a nucleosome and almost complete loss of Pol II–derived transcripts (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that Pol I and Pol III, but not Pol II, are capable of transcribing through a nucleosomal barrier without additional factors. In Pol II–dependent transcription, TFIIF together with the cleavage-stimulating factor TFIIS promotes elongation (17Schweikhard V. Meng C. Murakami K. Kaplan C.D. Kornberg R.D. Block S.M. Transcription factors TFIIF and TFIIS promote transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II by synergistic and independent mechanisms.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Because Rpa34.5/Rpa49 and Rpa12.2 share structural features with TFIIF and TFIIS, one could hypothesize that these subunits might facilitate transcription through a nucleosome. Therefore, we investigated whether the absence of Rpa12.2 and/or the Rpa34.5/Rpa49 heterodimer had an impact on Pol I transcription of a nucleosomal template. To study the influence of Pol I lb-module subunits on in vitro transcription, WT and mutant Pol I were affinity-purified from yeast"
https://openalex.org/W3005693736,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) selectively promotes translation of mRNAs with atypically long and structured 5'-UTRs and has been implicated in drug resistance. Through genome-wide transcriptome and translatome analysis we revealed eIF4E overexpression could promote cellular activities mediated by ERα and FOXM1 signalling pathways. Whilst eIF4E overexpression could enhance the translation of both ERα and FOXM1, it also led to enhanced transcription of FOXM1. Polysome fractionation experiments confirmed eIF4E could modulate the translation of ERα and FOXM1 mRNA. The enhancement of FOXM1 transcription was contingent upon the presence of ERα, and it was the high levels of FOXM1 that conferred Tamoxifen resistance. Furthermore, tamoxifen resistance was conferred by phosphorylation independent eIF4E overexpression. Immunohistochemistry on 134 estrogen receptor (ER+) primary breast cancer samples confirmed that high eIF4E expression was significantly associated with increased ERα and FOXM1, and significantly associated with tamoxifen resistance. Our study uncovers a novel mechanism whereby phosphorylation independent eIF4E translational reprogramming in governing the protein synthesis of ERα and FOXM1 contributes to anti-estrogen insensitivity in ER+ breast cancer. In eIF4E overexpressing breast cancer, the increased ERα protein expression in turn enhances FOXM1 transcription, which together with its increased translation regulated by eIF4E, contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Coupled with eIF4E translational regulation, our study highlights an important mechanism conferring tamoxifen resistance via both ERα dependent and independent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3005901110,"Spontaneously occurring canine mammary gland tumors share many features with human breast cancer, including biological behavior and histologic features. Compared to transgenic murine model, canine models have advantages including naturally occurring models of human diseases and cancer. In humans, breast cancer is divided into molecular subtypes based on ER, PR, and HER2 expression. In contrast with humans, few studies have evaluated these subtypes in canine mammary gland tumors, including expression of HER2. HER2 expression in canine mammary tissues has been further complicated by controversy regarding the antibody’s specificity. This study aimed to investigate c-erbB2 mRNA expression in retrospective formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples, using RNA in situ hybridization with a novel quantitative assay and to compare this method with immunohistochemistry. Using 48 canine mammary tumor samples and 14 non-neoplastic canine mammary tissues, RNA in situ hybridization was performed with RNAscope® using a canine-specific target gene probe (ERBB2), and quantitative measurement was performed using the housekeeping gene (POLR2A) to calculate the target gene/housekeeping gene ratio. The ratio of ERBB2/POLR2A was quantified using open-source image analysis programs and compared with the immunohistochemistry results. A significant correlation was observed between the HER2 immunohistochemistry score and ERBB2/POLR2A RNA in situ hybridization (P < 0.001). When the HER2 immunohistochemistry score was 3+, significantly higher expression of HER2 mRNA was observed by RNA in situ hybridization. Interestingly, HER2 mRNA was also observed in non-neoplastic mammary tissues by RNA in situ hybridization. This assay potentially facilitates the reliable quantification of mRNA expression levels in retrospective formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of HER2 in canine mammary gland tumors and to implement clinical trials in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3005957649,"The three-dimensional structures of chromosomes are increasingly being recognized as playing a major role in cellular regulatory states. The efficiency and promiscuity of phage Mu transposition was exploited to directly measure in vivo interactions between genomic loci in E. coli. Two global organizing principles have emerged: first, the chromosome is well-mixed and uncompartmentalized, with transpositions occurring freely between all measured loci; second, several gene families/regions show “clustering”: strong three-dimensional co-localization regardless of linear genomic distance. The activities of the SMC/condensin protein MukB and nucleoid-compacting protein subunit HU-α are essential for the well-mixed state; HU-α is also needed for clustering of 6/7 ribosomal RNA-encoding loci. The data are explained by a model in which the chromosomal structure is driven by dynamic competition between DNA replication and chromosomal relaxation, providing a foundation for determining how region-specific properties contribute to both chromosomal structure and gene regulation."

Here, we show that intra-amniotic lentiviral injection can efficiently transduce progenitor cells of the adult mammary gland and use that as a platform to functionally screen over 500 genetic lesions for functional roles in tumor formation. Targeted progenitors establish long-term clones of both luminal and myoepithelial lineages in adult animals, and via lineage tracing with stable barcodes, we found that each mouse mammary gland is generated from a defined number of ∼120 early progenitor cells that expand uniformly with equal growth potential. We then designed an in vivo screen to test genetic interactions in breast cancer and identified candidates that drove not only tumor formation but also molecular subtypes. Thus, this methodology enables rapid and high-throughput cancer driver discovery in mammary epithelium."

Unlike previous studies that were limited in the scope of analysis and manual examination. The present study aimed to conduct the automatic classification of acknowledgements on a large scale of data. To this end, we first created a training dataset for acknowledgements classification by sampling the acknowledgements sections from the entire PubMed Central database. Second, we adopted various supervised learning algorithms to examine which algorithm performed best in what condition. In addition, we observed the factors affecting classification performance. We investigated the effects of the following three main aspects: classification algorithms, categories, and text representations. The CNN+Doc2Vec algorithm achieved the highest performance of 93.58% accuracy in the original dataset and 87.93% in the converted dataset. The experimental results indicated that the characteristics of categories and sentence patterns influenced the performance of classification. Most of the classifiers performed better on the categories of financial, peer interactive communication, and technical support compared to other classes."
https://openalex.org/W3006587094,"Background Identifying acute ischemic stroke (AIS) among potential stroke cases is crucial for stroke research based on claims data. However, the accuracy of using the diagnostic codes of the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision was less than expected. Methods From the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) claims data, stroke cases admitted to the hospitals participating in the multicenter stroke registry (Clinical Research Collaboration for Stroke in Korea, CRCS-K) during the study period with principal or additional diagnosis codes of I60-I64 on the 10th revision of International Classification of Diseases were extracted. The datasets were randomly divided into development and validation sets with a ratio of 7:3. A stroke identification algorithm using the claims data was developed and validated through the linkage between the extracted datasets and the registry database. Results Altogether, 40,443 potential cases were extracted from the NHIS claims data, of which 31.7% were certified as AIS through linkage with the CRCS-K database. We selected 17 key identifiers from the claims data and developed 37 conditions through combinations of those key identifiers. The key identifiers comprised brain CT, MRI, use of tissue plasminogen activator, endovascular treatment, carotid endarterectomy or stenting, antithrombotics, anticoagulants, etc. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the algorithm were 81.2%, 82.9%, and 82.4% in the development set, and 80.2%, 82.0%, and 81.4% in the validation set, respectively. Conclusions Our stroke identification algorithm may be useful to grasp stroke burden in Korea. However, further efforts to refine the algorithm are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3041634142,"Abstract Accumulating evidences indicate that 3ʹUTR of the coding gene can act as crucial regulators in gastric cancer (GC). However, the detailed mechanisms and responsive targets are not well established. Here, we found that acvr1b gene 3ʹUTR ( acv 3UTR) was elevated in GC tissue, the expression of which was significantly correlated with advanced pTNM-stage and poor outcome in clinical patients. Forced expression of acv 3UTR promoted GC cells growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, our results suggested that acv 3UTR functioned as an oncogenic competing endogenous RNA via sponging miR-590-5p and enhancing YAP1 level. Tumor suppressor miR-590-5p was a molecular module in acv 3UTR regulatory axis, the forced expression of which led to impairing of oncogenic potential of acv 3UTR. The positive correlation of acv 3UTR and YAP1 expression, and the negative correlation of acv 3UTR and miR-590-5p expression, were verified in GC patients. Moreover, CFIm25 was identified as a key regulator contributing to acv 3UTR aberrant expression in GC binding to UGUA-264 motif. Overall, our finding defines a mechanism for understanding the potential role of acv 3UTR transcription in GC tumorigenesis, and indicates a correlation between 3ʹUTR trans -regulatory effect and GC development."
https://openalex.org/W3006379775,"Background Smoking is widely recognized as one of the most prevalent and preventable causes of many cancer types. This study aimed to quantify the population attributable fraction (PAF) of the lung cancer burden for smoking in Mongolia. Methods Lung cancer incidence and lung cancer-related death data came from the population-based national registry covering the period 2007–2016. Smoking prevalence data came from the STEPwise approach (STEP) national survey. The lung cancer-related disease burden was calculated and expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost by gender and by year. This was combined with current smoking and former smoking prevalence data, and relative risks (RR) of lung cancer-related deaths for current smokers and former smokers versus never smokers from region-specific cohort studies to estimate the PAF of lung cancer attributable to “ever-smoking” in Mongolia. Results Between 2007 and 2016, lung cancer accounted for the loss of over 63,000 DALYs in Mongolia. The PAF of lung cancer-related deaths attributable to current and former smoking combined was 58.1% (95% IR = 43.1%-72.2%) for men and 8.9% (95% IR = 4.1% -13.5%) for women. Smoking-attributable DALYs loss amounted to 2589 years (95% IR = 1907–3226) in 2016. Conclusions A considerable health loss may be prevented with an effective anti-smoking policy. In Mongolia, more than one third of lung cancer-related DALY loss is attributable to active smoking, and thus is potentially preventable. Furthermore, a gender-specific tobacco control policy may be worthwhile because of the large gender difference in smoking exposure in Mongolia. Next to this, age specific policy, including a smoke–free generation policy for adolescents, with targeted education, and mass media campaigns is needed."

The biochemical pathways of Eph receptors are context-dependent in part because of the varied composition of a heterotypic, oligomeric, active Eph receptor complex. Downstream of the Eph receptors, little is known about the essential phosphorylation events that define the context and instruct cell movement. Here, we define a pathway that is required for Eph receptor B2 (EphB2)–mediated cell sorting and is conserved among multiple Eph receptors. Utilizing a HEK293 model of EphB2+/ephrinB1+ cell segregation, we found that the scaffold adaptor protein SH2 domain–containing adaptor protein B (Shb) is essential for EphB2 functionality. Further characterization revealed that Shb interacts with known modulators of cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell mobility, including Nck adaptor protein (Nck), p120-Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP), and the α- and β-Chimaerin Rac GAPs. We noted that phosphorylation of Tyr297, Tyr246, and Tyr336 of Shb is required for EphB2–ephrinB1 boundary formation, as well as binding of Nck, RasGAP, and the chimaerins, respectively. Similar complexes were formed in the context of EphA4, EphA8, EphB2, and EphB4 receptor activation.

Eph receptors are the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases and play a distinct role in development, homeostasis, and cancer. The family is subdivided into two groups, composed of nine EphA receptors and five EphB receptors that participate in preferential binding to ligands within the ephrinA and ephrinB families, respectively. A well-defined cellular function of the Eph receptor is mediating directional cell movement during tissue boundary formation and axon guidance (reviewed in Ref. 1Kania A. Klein R.

Although these receptors use phosphotyrosine-mediated signals to alter cytoskeletal function, the biochemical mechanisms involved are complex and poorly defined. This is due, in part, to the diverse nature of receptor activation. To initiate signaling, a tetrameric or higher order complex forms consisting of at least two ephrins bound to two Eph receptors (9Himanen J.P. Yermekbayeva L. Janes P.W. Walker J.R. Xu K. Atapattu L.

A variety of Eph receptors and ephrin family members can participate in any given complex. In fact, the complex can expand to include both EphA and EphB receptors, as well as receptors that are not bound by ephrins (11Wimmer-Kleikamp S.H. Janes P.W. Squire A. Bastiaens P.I. Lackmann M.

Eph receptors activate diverse biochemical pathways by virtue of their unique intracellular domains that recruit a distinct set of proximal signaling effector proteins. To deconvolute Eph receptor signaling underlying the process of cell segregation, we undertook an siRNA screen in cell lines that overexpress EphB2 or its ligand ephrinB1 (13Jørgensen C. Sherman A.

Potential proteins of interest were then evaluated by quantitative MS for signaling-induced changes in phosphotyrosine levels. Because bidirectional signaling downstream of the Eph receptor and the ephrin ligand controls directed cell movement, we utilized isotopic labeling to distinguish phosphotyrosine-mediated signals in Eph receptor and ephrin-expressing cells, respectively.

Shb is phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues following activation of c-Met, epidermal growth factor receptor, or colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor and in response to fibroblast growth factor 2 (16Hornbeck P.V.

We previously demonstrated that Shb was required for in vitro boundary formation between EphB2+ cells and ephrinB1+ cells (13Jørgensen C. Sherman A. Chen G.I. Pasculescu A. Poliakov A. Hsiung M. Larsen B. Wilkinson D.G. Linding R. Pawson T. Cell-specific information processing in segregating populations of Eph receptor ephrin-expressing cells.Science. 2009; 326 (20007894): 1502-150910.1126/science.1176615Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the role of Shb during Eph or ephrin signaling remained unclear. Here we show that phosphorylated Shb binds known modulators of the cytoskeleton and polarized mobility, specifically Nck, p120 RasGAP, and Chimaerins, and these interactions enable EphB2-mediated heterotypic cell segregation. We previously identified Shb as a potential signaling protein required for Eph- and ephrin-mediated in vitro cell sorting in a large-scale siRNA screen in HEK293 cells (13Jørgensen C. Sherman A. Chen G.I. Pasculescu A. Poliakov A. Hsiung M. Larsen B. Wilkinson D.G. Linding R. Pawson T. Cell-specific information processing in segregating populations of Eph receptor ephrin-expressing cells.Science. 2009; 326 (20007894): 1502-150910.1126/science.1176615Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To determine whether Shb is required in both EphB2+ and ephrinB1+ cells or in only one cell type, we depleted Shb in each cell line and then reconstituted with the untreated heterologous cells in the sorting assay. HEK293 cells expressing a membrane-anchored GFP and EphB2 (EphB2+) were co-incubated with HEK293 cells expressing ephrinB1 (ephrinB1+) or parental HEK293 cells, as a negative control. After a 3-day period, the confluent monolayer was visualized by Hoescht-stained nuclei, and distribution of EphB2+ cells was monitored by the fluorescence of co-expressed GFP (Fig. 1). Compared with the negative control, where EphB2+ cells were co-incubated with parental HEK293 (Fig. 1A), incubation with ephrinB1-expressing cells forced the EphB2+ cells into compact clusters with cell crowding toward an elevated center and smooth, rounded borders (Fig. 1B). These clusters are evident through visualization of GFP or the tightly packed Hoescht-stained nuclei (Fig. 1B). Knockdown of ephrinB1 by siRNA in ephrinB1+ cells, but not EphB2+ cells, impaired heterotypic cell segregation (Fig. 1, C and D). Similarly, Shb siRNA treatment of the EphB2+ cells and not the ephrinB1+ cells impaired EphB2–ephrinB1 cell sorting. A time-lapse analysis of the Shb-depleted EphB2+GFP+ cell clusters that remained indicated that the clusters formed within 48 h after seeding but failed to develop sharper borders and become more compact at later times (Fig. S1). Thus, Shb primarily interacts with the EphB2 receptor to enhance the formation of boundaries between EphB2- and ephrinB1-expressing cells. Quantitative MS identified Shb as one of the most highly tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the EphB2-expressing cells upon co-incubation with ephrinB1-expressing cells, suggesting a phosphotyrosine-mediated scaffold function for Shb (13Jørgensen C. Sherman A. Chen G.I. Pasculescu A. Poliakov A. Hsiung M. Larsen B. Wilkinson D.G. Linding R. Pawson T. Cell-specific information processing in segregating populations of Eph receptor ephrin-expressing cells.Science. 2009; 326 (20007894): 1502-150910.1126/science.1176615Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Using soluble, cross-linked ephrinB1 to stimulate EphB2-expressing HEK293, we examined the time course of Shb phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Over the time period monitored, up to 60 min after ligation, a steady increase in Shb phosphorylation was observed, as detected by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting analysis. This temporal pattern also correlated with global changes to tyrosine phosphorylation in the whole cell lysate. To identify proteins associated with Shb during EphB2 signaling, we performed MS on Shb isolates from EphB2+ HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG epitope-tagged Shb (Shb+EphB2+). Nonspecific interactions were identified using a similar stable cell line expressing EphB2 and FLAG-tagged GFP (GFP+EphB2+). We found that adaptor proteins Nck1 and Nck2, the Ras GTPase-activating protein p120-RasGAP (RasGAP), and the α- and β-chimaerin RAC GAPs were enriched in Shb immunoprecipitate from cells stimulated with cross-linked ephrinB1 for 1 h (Table 1). The EphB2 receptor was also present but did not reliably demonstrate signaling-dependent association, suggesting that this interaction is weak, transient, or indirect in nature. Chimaerins are expressed in two main isoforms, with and without an SH2 domain. The peptide spectrum of β-chimaerin indicated that the SH2-containing isoform co-precipitated with Shb.Table 1Mass spectrometry analysis of FLAG-tagged Shb immunoprecipitationNCBIProteinExperiment 1Experiment 2StimulatedUnstimulatedStimulatedUnstimulatedTotal peptidesUnique peptidesMascot scoreTotal peptidesUnique peptidesMascot scoreTotal peptidesUnique peptidesMascot scoreTotal peptidesUnique peptidesMascot scoregi106879210Shb2568131142921911159330643392756645432958gi5453754Nck11812665285548gi52630423Nck2104320172459gi4506431RasGAP14332225047310822275gi209364623α-Chimaerin11641592358gi21396504EphB2863446832266247gi150378533Deubiquitinating enzyme 7662453310842141gi4757980β-Chimaerin32762398gi102469034Janus kinase 1228533167gi124378039SEC16 homolog A22932269 Open table in a new tab These MS results suggested that Shb forms a functional complex with Nck and RasGAP, both of which have been implicated in EphB2 signaling (20Holland S.J.

To further investigate whether Shb forms a complex with Nck and RasGAP following EphB2 activation, we monitored the kinetics of interaction by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). Although a low level of RasGAP appeared to associate with Shb prior to ephrinB1 stimulation, the levels of both Nck/Shb and RasGAP/Shb complex formation rose dramatically over the 60-min time period monitored. This pattern of association mirrored the enhancement of Shb tyrosine phosphorylation in Fig. 2. All subsequent experiments used a fixed 1-h time point to examine Shb complexes because this time point gave the strongest response in both assays. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation/Western blots performed on stimulated and unstimulated Shb+EphB2+ and GFP+EphB2+ cells further demonstrated association with Nck (Fig. 3B) and RasGAP (Fig. 3C), with detectable levels of Shb found only in samples from stimulated cells. Collectively, these results show the induction of a Shb complex with Nck and RasGAP following EphB2 stimulation. To confirm that Shb interacts with the Chimaerins downstream of EphB2, we examined Shb and Chimaerin immunoprecipitates in the context of EphB2 signaling. GFP+EphB2+ and Shb+EphB2+ cells expressing YFP-tagged 3The abbreviations used are: YFPyellow fluorescent proteinsiShbsiRNA targeting ShbCSTcortical spinal tract. α-Chimaerin or YFP-tagged β-Chimaerin were stimulated with ephrinB1. The presence of YFP-Chimaerin and FLAG-Shb was analyzed by Western blotting following immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG (Fig. 4A) or anti-YFP specific antibodies (Fig. 4B). FLAG-tagged Shb immunoprecipitates contained both α- and β-Chimaerin, specifically in samples from ephrinB1-stimulated cells. Chimaerins were not detected in FLAG-tagged GFP control precipitates. The reverse immunoprecipitation of YFP, YFP–α-Chimaerin, and YFP–β-Chimaerin similarly demonstrated an association between Shb and the Chimaerins (Fig. 4B). FLAG-Shb was enriched in precipitates of YFP-Chimaerin from stimulated EphB2+ cells. These data indicate that EphB2 stimulation enhances the association between Shb and Chimaerins. yellow fluorescent protein siRNA targeting Shb cortical spinal tract. Nck, RasGAP, and the Chimaerins all contain SH2 domains capable of interacting directly with phosphorylated tyrosines in Shb. We previously reported significantly enhanced Shb phosphorylation on tyrosines 114, 246, 268, 297, and 336 in EphB2+ cells stimulated by ephrinB1+ cells (13Jørgensen C. Sherman A. Chen G.I. Pasculescu A. Poliakov A. Hsiung M. Larsen B. Wilkinson D.G. Linding R. Pawson T.

To test whether these residues contribute to interactions with candidate SH2-containing proteins, we generated a series of variants in which each individual tyrosine was mutated to phenylalanine. Additionally, we created Y268F/Y336F Shb double mutant as RasGAP binds to similar phosphotyrosine motifs in the DOK1 scaffold (2F in Fig. 5A) (22Shah K. Shokat K.M. A chemical genetic screen for direct v-Src substrates reveals ordered assembly of a retrograde signaling pathway.Chem.

We then monitored the efficiency of protein association with each Shb variant following EphB2 stimulation. The Shb mutant Y297F demonstrated impaired Nck binding (Fig. 5B), whereas the Shb Y246F mutant exhibited diminished RasGAP binding (Fig. 5C). Mutation of Shb Tyr336 ablated binding of both α- and β-chimaerins (Fig. 6). These data demonstrate that distinct phosphotyrosine sites on Shb mediate the binding of distinct SH2-signaling proteins.Figure 6Shb requires Tyr336 to bind α- and β-chimaerin. EphB2+ HEK293 cells were transfected with empty vector, FLAG-tagged Shb, and FLAG-tagged Shb mutants, as well as α- or β-chimaerin as indicated. The cells were stimulated with cross-linked ephrinB1.

IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated whether the SH2 domains of RasGAP and α-Chimaerins were sufficient to mediate the interaction with Shb. (Fig. 7). We observed that the expressed GST-α-Chimaerin SH2 domain precipitated WT Shb efficiently from the lysates of stimulated cells and that this construct exhibited reduced binding to the Shb Y336F mutant (Fig. 7A). We observed that the C-terminal SH2 domain of RasGAP (C-SH2) was sufficient to bind to Shb (Fig. 7B), and interaction was lost with the Shb Y246F mutant. In distinction, the N-terminal SH2 domain of RasGAP (N-SH2) demonstrated no interaction with Shb. We note, however, that the RasGAP N-SH2 construct was difficult to express, suggesting that this construct may not be fully functional. These data indicate that the α-Chimaerin SH2 and the C-terminal SH2 of RasGAP effectively interact with Shb Tyr336 and Tyr246, respectively. To determine the functional significance of these interactions during EphB2–ephrinB1 boundary formation, we constructed a GFP+EphB2+ cell line expressing a Shb mutant with phenylalanine mutations at Tyr246, Tyr297, and Tyr336 (3FShbR). Four silent nucleotide mutations were also introduced for siRNA resistance, which would allow for testing of mutant activity in the absence of endogenous Shb. Control cell lines expressed vector alone, WT Shb (Shbwt), and an siRNA-resistant WT Shb (ShbR). Untreated cell lines were initially characterized for EphB2–ephrinB1 cell segregation activity by visualization of tightly packed GFP+ cells within a confluent well of a 96-well dish (Fig. 8). Cell lines with enhanced expression of WT Shb, Shbwt, and ShbR, formed more compact clusters with sharper borders compared with 3FShbR cells, the parental cell line and vector control (Fig. 8A). This effect was apparent in co-cultures with HEK293 cells (−ephrinB1), which express low levels of endogenous ephrinB ligands (23Poliakov A. Cotrina M.L. Pasini A. Wilkinson D.G. Regulation of EphB2 activation and cell repulsion by feedback control of the MAPK pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183 (19047466): 933-94710.1083/jcb.200807151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and was further enhanced during co-cultures with ephrinB1+ cells (+ephrinB1). Increased compaction was measurable as a decreased cluster size and enhanced fluorescence in Shb and ShbR samples (Fig. 8, B and C). Similar trends with statistical significance were apparent upon a manual count of efficient GFP+ cell segregation marked by clusters with an elevated center and smooth, rounded borders (Fig. S2). The ability of WT Shb to support boundary formation in the absence of exogenous ephrinB ligand was also seen during routine cell culture, where the Shb and ShbR cells spontaneously formed tight clusters that were slightly elevated from the cell monolayer (Fig. S3). Collectively, these data show that WT Shb is sufficient to enhance EphB2-mediated boundary formation, whereas the 3FShb is not. Shb was then depleted by siRNA to allow for examination of WT ShbR and 3FShbR activity in the absence of endogenous Shb (Fig. 9A). Segregation of EphB2+GFP+ cells expressing vector alone and Shbwt was impaired when siRNA targeting Shb (siShb) was added to the co-culture (Fig. 9, B–D, and Fig. S4). Expression of WT, siRNA-resistant ShbR partially restored the formation of tight GFP+ clusters during siShb treatment, whereas 3FShbR cells had a phenotype similar to that of Shbwt and vector controls. Thus, the 3F mutation ablates any restorative function, suggesting that these tyrosines are required for Shb activity during EphB2–eprhinB1 cell sorting. Because RasGAP (21Becker E. Huynh-Do U.

https://openalex.org/W3005610078,"Background Mozambique is one of the countries with the deadly implementation gaps in the tuberculosis (TB) care and services delivery. In-hospital delays in TB diagnosis and treatment, transmission and mortality still persist, in part, due to poor-quality of TB care cascade. Objective We aimed to assess, from the healthcare workers’ (HCW) perspective, factors associated with poor-quality TB care cascade and explore local sustainable suggestions to improve in-hospital TB management. Methods In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with different categories of HCW. Audio-recording and written notes were taken, and content analysis was performed through atlas.ti7. Results Bottlenecks within hospital TB care cascade, lack of TB staff and task shifting, centralized and limited time of TB laboratory services, and fear of healthcare workers getting infected by TB were mentioned to be the main factors associated with implementation gaps. Interviewees believe that task shifting from nurses to hospital auxiliary workers, and from higher and well-trained to lower HCW are accepted and feasible. The expansion and use of molecular TB diagnostic tools are seen by the interviewees as a proper way to fight effectively against both sensitive and MDR TB. Ensuring provision of N95 respiratory masks is believed to be an essential requirement for effective engagement of the HCW on high-quality in-hospital TB care. For monitoring and evaluation, TB quality improvement teams in each health facility are considered to be an added value. Conclusion Shortage of resources within the national TB control programme is one of the potential factors for poor-quality of the TB care cascade. Task shifting of TB care and services delivery, decentralization of the molecular TB diagnostic tools, and regular provision of N95 respiratory masks should contribute not just to reduce the impact of resource scarceness, but also to ensure proper TB diagnosis and treatment to both sensitive and MDR TB."

This exploratory study reports motivators for participation in BCEPs among women and racial/ethnic minority students-historically underrepresented groups-and the influence of program and personal variables on their research-career intent and self-efficacy beliefs. We studied the program variables of research experience, research duration, and mentor influence; and the personal variables of race, gender, family, and peers. Using the conceptual framework of planned behavior theory and social cognitive career theory, we interviewed students from underrepresented groups participating in BCEPs that offered research experience for short duration (Group A), long duration (Group B), and no research experience (Group C). We utilized Atlas Ti, a qualitative methodological software tool, to analyze the interview responses. Students choosing a BCEP with research experience cited ""opportunity to gain experience"" and ""interest or curiosity in research"" as motivators. Duration of research experience had a positive relationship with enhancement in research skills and self-efficacy beliefs, but did not change the initial research-career intent of these BCEP participants. The study revealed an interesting and unexpected theme of ""perceived deterrents"" to a career in research that included stress of competition (e.g. grants), the instability of projects, and the isolation of scientific research. Importantly, the study findings indicate the need to reform program design and science policies that challenge the current biomedical workforce and dissuade interested students from underrepresented groups from entering the field."
https://openalex.org/W3005607590,"Aim To examine patterns of hazardous, harmful and dependent drinking across different socio-economic groups, and how this relationship may be explained by common mental disorder. Methods and findings Between 2011–2013, 1,052 participants (age range 17–91, 53% female) were interviewed for Phase 2 of the South East London Community Health study. Latent class analysis was used to define six groups based on multiple indicators of socio-economic status in three domains. Alcohol use (low risk, hazardous, harmful/dependent) was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and the presence of common mental disorder was measured using the revised Clinical Interview Schedule. Multinomial regression was used to explore associations with hazardous, harmful and dependent alcohol use, including after adjustment for common mental disorder. Harmful and dependent drinking was more common among people in Class 2 ‘economically inactive renters’ (relative risk ratio (RRR) 3.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07–8.71), Class 3 ‘economically inactive homeowners’ (RRR 4.11, 95% CI 1.19–14.20) and Class 6 ‘professional renters’ (RRR 3.51, 95% CI 1.14–10.78) than in Class 1 ‘professional homeowners’. Prevalent common mental disorder explained some of the increased risk of harmful or dependent drinking in Class 2, but not Class 3 or 6. Conclusions Across distinct socio-economic groups in a large inner-city sample, we found important differences in harmful and dependent drinking, only some of which were explained by common mental disorder. The increased risk of harmful or dependent drinking across classes which are very distinct from each other suggests differing underlying drivers of drinking across these groups. A nuanced understanding of alcohol use and problems is necessary to understand the inequalities in alcohol harms."
https://openalex.org/W3006099313,"Background Although protective associations between dietary antioxidants and pregnancy outcomes have been reported, randomized controlled trials of supplementation have been almost uniformly negative. A possible explanation is that supplementation during pregnancy may be too late to have a beneficial effect. Therefore, we examined the relationship between antioxidant levels prior to pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods and findings Serum carotenoids and tocopherols were assayed in fasting specimens at 1985–86 (baseline) and 1992–1993 (year 7) from 1,215 participants in Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. An interviewer-administered quantitative food-frequency questionnaire assessed dietary intake of antioxidants. Pregnancy outcome was self-reported at exams every 2 to 5 years. Linear and logistic regression modeling was used to assess relationships of low birthweight (LBW; <2,500 g), continuous infant birthweight, preterm birth (PTB; <37 weeks) and length of gestation with antioxidant levels adjusted for confounders, as well as interactions with age and race. Results In adjusted models, lycopene was associated with higher odds of LBW (adjusted odds ratio for top quartile, 2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.14, 3.92) and shorter gestational age (adjusted beta coefficient -0.50 weeks). Dietary intake of antioxidants was associated with lower birthweight, while supplement use of vitamin C was associated with higher gestational age (0.41 weeks, 0.01, 0.81). Conclusions Higher preconception antioxidant levels are not associated with better birth outcomes."

A new test design and modified field methods have therefore been developed to decrease uncertainty and variability and to be able to detect small effects. The new test design comprises a monitoring phase (before the tunnel phase) for the selection of honeybee colonies and modified methods, which include assessments of colony strength, an evaluation of the cell content of all cells of hives using photos and digital analysis, and the use of video recordings for the assessment of foraging activity and forager mortality. With the proposed new study design and the modified field methods variability between hives was considerably reduced, which resulted in a marked reduction of the minimum detectable difference (MDD). This makes it possible to address the Specific Protection Goals defined by the European Food Safety Authority and to gain unprecedented insight into the development of hives and driving factors."
https://openalex.org/W3007387444,"During folliculogenesis, oocytes are dependent on metabolic and molecular support from surrounding somatic cells. Here, we examined the role of the dynamin (DNM) family of mechanoenzymes in mediating endocytotic uptake into growing follicular oocytes. We found DNM1 and DNM2 to be highly expressed in growing follicular oocytes as well as in mature germinal vesicle (GV) and metaphase II (MII) stage oocytes. Moreover, oocyte-specific conditional knockout (cKO) of DNM2 (DNM2Δ) led to complete sterility, with follicles arresting at the preantral stage of development. In addition, DNM2Δ ovaries were characterized by disrupted follicular growth as well as oocyte and follicle apoptosis. Further, the loss of DNM activity, either through DNM2 cKO or through pharmacological inhibition (Dyngo 6a) led to the impairment of endocytotic pathways in preantral oocytes as well as in mature GV and MII oocytes, respectively. Loss of DNM activity resulted in the redistribution of endosomes and the misslocalization of clathrin and actin, suggesting dysfunctional endocytosis. Notably, there was no observable effect on the fertility of DNM1Δ females. Our study has provided new insight into the complex and dynamic nature of oocyte growth during folliculogenesis, suggesting a role for DNM2 in mediating the endocytotic events that are essential for oocyte development."
https://openalex.org/W3005783611,"Genetically encoded pH indicators (GEpHI) have emerged as important tools for investigating intracellular pH (pHi) dynamics in Drosophila. However, most of the indicators are based on the Gal4/UAS binary expression system. Here, we report the generation of a ubiquitously-expressed GEpHI. The fusion protein of super ecliptic pHluorin and FusionRed was cloned under the tubulin promoter (tpHusion) to drive it independently of the Gal4/UAS system. The function of tpHusion was validated in various tissues from different developmental stages of Drosophila. Differences in pHi were also indicated correctly in fixed tissues. Finally, we describe the use of tpHusion for comparative analysis of pHi in manipulated clones and the surrounding cells in epithelial tissues. Our findings establish tpHusion as a robust tool for studying pHi in Drosophila."
