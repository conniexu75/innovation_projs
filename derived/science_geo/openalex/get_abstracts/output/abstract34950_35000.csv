https://openalex.org/W2004118180,"T cell proliferation in response to stimulation with Staphylococcus enterotoxin A (SEA) requires accessory cells that express class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Murine fibroblasts transfected with genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits of HLA-DR, DQ, or DP were used to show that the proliferative response of purified human T cells to SEA is dependent on class II molecules but is not restricted by the haplotype of the responder. Binding of fluoresceinated SEA to class II transfectants and precipitation of class II heterodimers with SEA-Sepharose show that the proliferative response is a result of SEA binding to class II molecules. The binding is specific for class II molecules and is independent of class II allotype or isotype. The ability of SEA to bind class II molecules may be a general characteristic of this class of antigens, now called ""superantigens""."
https://openalex.org/W1571641225,"Abstract Although fibroblasts are important in providing a structural framework for most tissues, they also appear to be active participants in the inflammatory process via the production of specific mediators. The production of inflammatory mediators by fibroblasts is especially important in relation to their strategic location within connective tissue as they may act as a cellular communication bridge between the interstitium and vasculature. In this paper, we demonstrate that fibroblasts may participate in these inflammatory reactions by the production of a neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) with characteristics similar to a recently isolated and cloned monocyte-derived NCF. Either tumor necrosis factor-alpha-, interleukin-1 alpha-, or interleukin-1 beta-stimulated fibroblasts showed both a time- and dose-dependent increase in steady-state levels of NCF mRNA and secretion of chemotactic activity. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-6 failed to induce fibroblast-derived NCF. The expression of fibroblast-derived NCF mRNA was first detectable by 30 min poststimulation, whereas chemotactic activity was significantly observed 3-4 h postchallenge. Heat-inactivated monokine (100 degrees C) failed to induce NCF mRNA expression, suggesting that only the active proteins are capable of inducing NCF. Gel filtration analysis using high pressure liquid chromatography indicated peak chemotactic activity with an approximate molecular mass of 8000 daltons. This peak of NCF activity was found to be relatively stable to both heat and trypsin inactivation. Specificity of the fibroblast-derived neutrophil chemotactic activity was demonstrated with inhibition of chemotaxis by the addition of neutralizing antibody directed against recombinant human neutrophil chemotactic factor. These data provide evidence that monokine-treated fibroblasts can synthesize a potent chemotactic agent with molecular and physicochemical characteristics similar to monocyte-derived NCF and that this factor may contribute to neutrophil-mediated disease processes."
https://openalex.org/W1537149240,"Insulin is a major regulator of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. The molecular events associated with LPL regulation by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were studied by determining LPL enzyme activity, mRNA levels, protein synthetic rate, and transcription run-off activity. Adipocytes treated with insulin (10(-6) M for 48 h) had substantially higher LPL activity (mean difference compared to carrier-treated cells 146%) with little difference in LPL mRNA levels (mean level 109% of control). Insulin regulation of LPL activity was dose-dependent but changes in LPL mRNA were not. Within 2 h of hormone addition, LPL activity was higher in insulin-treated versus carrier-treated adipocytes although their LPL mRNA levels were similar. In [35S]methionine pulse-labeled adipocytes, insulin decreased LPL protein synthetic rate measured by immunoprecipitation 42-48%, although increases (75-340%) in heparin-releasable LPL activity were detected in the same cells. In contrast, during differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to the adipocyte state, 5-80-fold increases of heparin-releasable LPL activity were closely associated with similar (8-60-fold) increases in LPL mRNA levels. LPL synthetic rate was 16-fold greater, and LPL gene transcription initiation measured by transcriptional run-off was 10-fold higher in adipocytes than in undifferentiated cells. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts increases transcription of the LPL gene leading to increased LPL mRNA, protein synthetic rate, and enzyme activity. Insulin regulation of LPL activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, however, is mediated entirely at posttranscriptional and posttranslational levels."
https://openalex.org/W1980552247,"The neuron-specific protein GAP-43 is associated with the membrane of the nerve growth cone and thus may be important to the activity of this distinctive neuronal structure. Transient transfection of COS and NIH 3T3 cells with appropriate vectors resulted in expression of GAP-43 in these non-neuronal cells; as in neurons, transfected GAP-43 associated with the membrane. In addition, many long fine filopodial processes extended from the periphery of such transfected cells. Stable CHO cell lines expressing GAP-43 also exhibited processes that were more numerous, far longer, and more complex than those of CHO cell lines not transfected or transfected with control plasmids. Thus GAP-43 may directly contribute to growth cone activity by regulating cell membrane structure and enhancing extension of filopodial processes."
https://openalex.org/W1602454738,"The polymerase and 3′-5′-exonuclease activities of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I are located on separate structural domains of the protein, separated by about 30 A. To determine whether a DNA primer terminus can move from one active site to the other without dissociation of the enzyme-DNA complex, we carried out reactions on a labeled DNA substrate in the presence of a large excess of unlabeled DNA, to limit observations to a single enzyme-DNA encounter. The results indicated that while Klenow fragment is capable of intramolecular shuttling of a DNA substrate between the two catalytic sites, the intermolecular pathway involving enzyme-DNA dissociation can also be used. Thus, there is nothing in the protein structure or the reaction mechanism that dictates a particular means of moving the DNA substrate. Instead, the use of the intermolecular or the intramolecular pathway is determined by the competition between the polymerase or exonuclease reaction and DNA dissociation. When the substrate has a mispaired primer terminus, DNA dissociation seems generally more rapid than exonucleolytic digestion. Thus, Klenow fragment edits its own polymerase errors by a predominantly intermolecular process, involving dissociation of the enzyme-DNA complex and reassociation of the DNA with the exonuclease site of a second molecule of Klenow fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1536942780,"The transcription of ribosomal RNA genes differs from that of other genes in several respects: the use of a specialized polymerase, the generally high level of transcription, and the tandem arrangement of the genes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified a nucleotide sequence in the nontranscribed spacer region that had many characteristics of an enhancer of transcription (8). More recently, it has become apparent that transcription of this sequence occurs (9) and that it may also be involved in some aspect of termination of 35 S rRNA transcription. The likelihood that there are protein factors involved in termination and activation of transcription and that these may participate in the coupling of the transcription of adjacent rRNA genes led us to search for proteins that might bind to the enhancer. We have identified two such proteins, termed REB1 and REB2, that bind to the enhancer and protect specific sequences from attack by chemical and enzymatic reagents. It is noteworthy that there is a second REB1 binding site approximately 210 base pairs upstream of the origin of transcription of rRNA and that binding of REB1 to this site alters the conformation of DNA adjacent to the site of initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1543507842,"Expression of the proto-oncogene p93c-fes and its associated tyrosine kinase activity is marked in mature granulocytes, monocytes, differentiated HL-60 leukemia cells, and leukemia cell lines KG-1, THP-1, HEL, and U-937, which can be induced to differentiate along the granulocyte/monocyte pathway. Conversely, p93-c-fes expression is absent in the K562 cell line, which is resistant to myeloid differentiation. Upon transfection and clonal selection of K562 cells using a mammalian expression vector containing the 13-kilobase pair c-fes gene, c-fes mRNA was transcribed and p93-c-fes tyrosine activity kinase was expressed. Clones expressing c-fes underwent myeloid differentiation as assessed by the appearance of phagocytic activity, Fc receptors, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction, Mac-1 immunofluorescence, and lysozyme production. These results indicate that the expression of the c-fes protooncogene and its associated tyrosine kinase activity plays a major role in the initiation of myeloid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1527910889,"Glucocorticoids induce growth inhibition and eventually cause cell lysis in certain sensitive leukemic cells. To investigate how glucocorticoids interact with cell growth pathways, we studied the expression of 14 growth-related genes in dexamethasone-treated CEM-C7A cells, a steroid-sensitive clone of the CCRF-CEM cell line, and in several closely related clones. The 14 genes studied were chosen to represent four different levels of mitogenic signal transduction. Detectable mRNA levels were found for 8 of the 14 genes, but among these only c-myc expression was obviously suppressed by dexamethasone. The c-myc mRNA levels declined abruptly during the first 12 h after addition of 1 microM dexamethasone, and maximal suppression occurred by 18 h. This change was not seen in the C7A controls, in the glucocorticoid-resistant, receptor-deficient clone ICR-27, or in the glucocorticoid-resistant, receptor-positive clone C1. H.10, a hybrid clone between C1 and ICR-27, showed restoration of the sensitive phenotype, and in H.10 cells the c-myc mRNA was also suppressed by dexamethasone. Our results suggest that: 1) functional glucocorticoid receptor is required for inducing c-myc suppression. 2) In dexamethasone-resistant cells with functional receptors c-myc is not suppressed. 3) The growth arrest induced by glucocorticoids correlates with, and may be regulated via, suppression of c-myc expression."
https://openalex.org/W1553140039,"The activity of the amino sugar-synthesizing enzyme L-glutamine:D-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.16) in haploid a cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae increases 1.7-fold after alpha factor addition. The gene (the gene should be called GFA1 for glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase) for the enzyme has been cloned by complementing the gcn1 mutation (Whelan, W. L., and Ballou, C. E. (1975) J. Bacteriol. 125, 1545-1557). Its expression is increased 2-3 times within 15 min when the mating pheromone is added. The gene codes for a protein of 716 amino acids in length. It is highly homologous (64%) to the corresponding gene of Escherichia coli, except for a sequence coding for 83 amino acids (numbers 204-286), which is lacking in E. coli. The amino-terminal region of the coding sequence also shows a high degree of homology to the corresponding sequence of the E. coli and S. cerevisiae L-glutamine:phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase. In the promotor region of the S. cerevisiae L-glutamine:D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase gene the heptanucleotide TGAAACA, shown to be required for pheromone control of transcription (Kronstad, J. W., Holly, J. A., and MacKay, V. L. (1987) Cell 50, 369-377), is present six times."
https://openalex.org/W2169041986,"Expression of the ompF and ompC genes of Escherichia coli requires the OmpR protein for transcriptional activation. In vivo binding of the OmpR protein to the ompF and ompC promoter regions was observed using an in vivo dimethyl sulfate DNA footprinting technique. Two different sequence motifs were found to be protected by OmpR in both the ompF and ompC promoter regions. This technique was further used to localize the DNA-binding domain of OmpR to be within the C-terminal 117 amino acid residues. Binding of the C-terminal portion OmpR to the ompF and ompC promoter regions, however, did not result in activation of transcription. Our results, together with sequence homologies between OmpR and other regulatory proteins, suggests that OmpR has separable domain structures: the C-terminal portion for binding-specific DNA sequences and the N-terminal portion for interacting with RNA polymerase and/or other transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1493145825,"Intact, monomeric type IV procollagen was isolated from the medium of PF-HR9 cells. Its stability was measured by optical rotatory dispersion, differential scanning calorimetry, and trypsin susceptibility of the partially unfolded molecules. At neutral pH, a complex transition between 35 and 42 degrees C and a smaller transition at 48 degrees C are observed by optical rotatory dispersion, using a heating rate of 10 degrees C/h. Reduction of the heating rate to 1.6 degrees C/h resulted in a 1 degree C lowering of the apparent melting temperatures. A similar curve is observed in 10 mM acetic acid, with transitions about 2 degrees C lower. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed transitions at 36.0, 42.1, and 48.0 degrees C at neutral pH, with a total transition enthalpy of 17.1 kJ/mol tripeptide units. In 10 mM acetic acid, transitions at 35.6, 38.9, 41.7, and 50.0 degrees C are observed. The transition enthalpy is 16.4 kJ/mol tripeptide units. The transition enthalpy is similar to values found for interstitial collagens. Results from trypsin digestion experiments are consistent with the stability found by optical methods and calorimetry. The rate and completeness of refolding after melting were measured. In neutral buffer, the initial rate was found to be 0.041 min-1, faster than the refolding rates observed with types pN III and III collagen. Peptidyl prolyl cis-trans-isomerase increased the refolding rate to 0.083 min-1, indicating that cis-trans-isomerization is the rate-limiting step, despite the interruptions in the triple helix. Trypsin digestion experiments indicated that the refolding mechanism is similar in the presence and absence of the enzyme. Refolding was nearly complete in neutral buffer. In 10 mM acetic acid, folding was considerably slower and went to about 74% completion. In both solvents, the refolded material was only slightly less stable than the native material. Electron microscopy of partially refolded samples showed that most refolding started at the COOH terminus, but some was initiated at other sites."
https://openalex.org/W1535993489,"Abstract Secretory granules exocytosed from rat serosal mast cells bind low density lipoprotein (LDL), and on being phagocytosed by macrophages, carry the bound LDL into these cells (Kokkonen, J. O., and Kovanen, P. T. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 2287-2291). The binding of LDL to the granules is mediated through interactions between the apolipoprotein B (apoB) component of LDL and the heparin proteoglycan component of the granules. Here we report how degradation of apoB by the neutral proteases of the granules affects the granule-mediated uptake of LDL by cultured mouse macrophages. During incubation of LDL with proteolytically inactive granules, the rate of uptake of LDL by macrophages increased by 10-fold; whereas during incubation with proteolytically active granules, it increased by 50-fold, the increase in the rate of uptake during proteolysis correlating with the degree of apoB degradation. The 5-fold greater capacity of the proteolytically active granules to enhance the uptake of LDL resulted from their greater capacity to bind LDL, and consequently, to carry it into the macrophages. Electron microscopic analysis of LDL bound to the proteolytically active granules disclosed large spherical particles of fused LDL. The diameters of the granule-bound particles ranged up to 90 nm compared with an average diameter of 22 nm for both native LDL and the LDL bound to proteolytically inactive granules. The results show that granule proteases, by inducing fusion of granule-bound LDL, increase the amount of LDL bound per unit weight of granule heparin proteoglycan. Hence, the two components of mast cell granules, the proteases and the heparin proteoglycan, act in concert to promote the uptake of LDL by macrophages in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1482754811,"Suramin, a drug used in the treatment of trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis inhibits growth factor-induced mitogenesis. In the present report, we show that suramin inhibits the growth of human colic adenocarcinoma cells HT29-D4 and rapidly induces their differentiation into enterocyte-like cells. As soon as 6 days after the addition of suramin (100 micrograms/ml) in the culture medium, the cells form a polarized monolayer of regular columnar cells with occluding junctions delimiting two distinct membrane domains (apical and basolateral) and an apical brush-border expressing alkaline phosphatase and sucrase-isomaltase. The process of differentiation is fully reversible when the drug is removed from the culture medium. We also show that suramin inhibits both glucose consumption and lactate production so that the glycolytic activity of the treated cells is lowered by 42%. This observation would shed some light on the complex mechanisms involved during the induction of HT29 cell differentiation when glucose is removed from the culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W1502915399,"Abstract The active form of protein B2, a homodimeric subunit of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase, contains a diferric iron center and a cationic free radical localized to tyrosine 122 of one of the two polypeptide chains. Hydroxyurea scavenges this radical but leaves the iron center intact. The resulting metB2 (earlier named B2/HU) is enzymatically inactive. Crude extracts of E. coli catalyze the interconversion of metB2 and B2. Radical introduction into metB2 requires a flavin reductase together with a second poorly defined protein fraction (Fraction b) as well as dioxygen, NAD(P)H, and a flavin (Fontecave, M., Eliasson, R., and Reichard, P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12325-12331). We now find that ferrous ions can substitute for Fraction b and that the diferric center of metB2 is reduced during anaerobic incubation of the system with reduced flavin and ferrous ions. Spectroscopic evidence and isotope experiments suggest an in situ reduction of the diferric to a diferrous center. Admission of oxygen then results in the instantaneous oxidation of tyrosine 122 to the cationic radical coupled to the reformation of the diferric center, giving enzymatically active B2. These data suggest that reduced diferrous B2 is an intermediate between metB2 and B2 during radical introduction. In addition, we find that anaerobic incubation of B2 with reduced flavin results in the loss of the tyrosyl radical and the formation of metB2. This reaction occurs in the absence of Fraction b or ferrous ions. Our experiments reconstitute with defined reagents the interconversion between metB2 and B2 observed earlier in the E. coli extract. The flavin reductase system catalyzes the interconversion in both directions with dioxygen as the critical factor deciding whether activation or inactivation of ribonucleotide reductase occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1530657391,"The effect of insulin on the expression of the gene encoding the rat brain glucose transporter (GT) was studied in 3T3 F442A murine adipocytes. Differentiation from fibroblasts into adipocytes did not alter the basal expression of this gene, but did confer on the cells the ability to accumulate GT mRNA in response to insulin. Concentrations of the hormone less than 40 nM were capable of stimulating about a 5-fold increase in GT mRNA in adipocytes, whereas insulin was without effect in fibroblasts. The stimulation in adipocytes by insulin was maximal 4 h after the addition of the hormone and was preceded by a 4-6-fold augmentation in the transcription of the GT gene. In NIH/3T3 HIR3.5 cells, which express 3 X 10(6) insulin receptors per cell due to the introduction of the receptor cDNA by DNA-mediated gene transfer (Whittaker, J., Okamoto, A., Thyss, R., Bell, G.I., Steiner, D.F., and Hofmann, C. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 5237-5241), insulin increased GT mRNA levels at the same concentrations and to the same extent as in adipocytes. The augmentation in GT gene expression in HIR3.5 cells occurred 3-4 h of addition of insulin correlated with a 3-4-fold increase in glucose transport in these cells. These data demonstrate that: 1) the differentiation from fibroblasts to adipocytes is accompanied by the acquisition of an insulin-stimulated mechanism for the regulation of GT gene expression. 2) In fibroblasts, the limiting factor in the pathway regulating GT mRNA levels by insulin is the low number of receptors, since their expression by gene transfer in the absence of differentiation is sufficient to confer sensitivity to insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1485428336,"The recombinase of the Salmonella inversion system, Hin, mediates site-specific recombination between two 26 base pairs (bp) inverted repeat sequences (hixL and hixR) which flank a 993-bp DNA segment. We have investigated Hin recognition of, and association with, the hix recombination sites. Nuclease and chemical protection studies with linear and supercoiled DNA substrates demonstrate that Hin initially binds hixL and hixR independently of binding of the other protein components of the inversion system, Fis and HU. DNA-binding assays with mutant recombination sites and methylation interference experiments indicate that the critical bases for Hin recognition of its DNA-binding site are within an 8-bp sequence covering adjacent major and minor grooves of the DNA helix in each of the 12-bp half-sites of the hix recombination sites. The nature of the Hin-hix complexes in these binding studies and the results of gel filtration assays with purified Hin suggests that Hin binds the recombination sites as a dimer. The implications of the nature of the interactions of Hin with its recombination sites on the mechanism of the recombination reaction and on the novel features of DNA recognition by Hin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W240886503,"The CDC6 gene product is required for entering the S phase of the cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It has been isolated on recombinant plasmids by selection for complementation of temperature-sensitive alleles with a yeast genomic library. The entire complementing activity is carried on a 1.8-kilobase chromosomal DNA fragment, as revealed by deletion mapping. Northern blotting shows that the size of the CDC6 mRNA is about 1.7 kilobases. A Southern blot of yeast chromosomes which were separated by the field inversion gel electrophoresis method indicates that the isolated DNA fragment is derived from chromosome X. The locus from which the clone was derived was marked by integration with a nutritional marker and found by meiotic mapping to cosegregate with CDC6. Thus, we conclude that we have isolated the authentic CDC6 gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the CDC6 gene has revealed an open reading frame that encodes a protein with Mr = 57,969. There are five potential Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) glycosylation sites and a highly conserved nucleotide-binding site in the CDC6 sequence. Although computer surveys indicate overall sequence homology between S. cerevisiae CDC6 protein and Saccharomyces pombe CDC10 START protein, they may not be functionally equivalent as evaluated by the complementation assay."
https://openalex.org/W1531494225,"We have employed a filter binding assay to help study the mechanism by which bound L-tryptophan enables the Escherichia coli trp repressor to bind its operators. We have prepared variants of the trp repressor using structural analogues of the natural corepressor, L-tryptophan, and measured the affinity of these variants for a 20-base pair oligonucleotide duplex containing a symmetrical idealization of the trp operator from the E. coli trpEDCBA operon. By normalizing for each analogue's previously determined affinity for the trp aporepressor, we have estimated the extent to which each of the functional groups of bound L-tryptophan contributes to operator affinity. We discuss the likely role of these functional groups in the context of the crystal structures of the inactive, unliganded trp aporepressor, the liganded, active repressor, an inactive pseudorepressor (Pseudorepressors are formed by analogues of L-tryptophan that bind at the tryptophan-binding site but form near isomorphs of the repressor that have poor affinity for operator-DNA.) and the trp repressor/operator complex. We find that the alpha-amino group and an unsubstituted amino (-NH-) nitrogen of L-tryptophan's indole ring are essential for operator affinity. The former properly orients the corepressor and the latter interacts directly with the DNA. The alpha-carboxyl group, on the other hand, greatly enhances but is not essential for operator binding. The alpha-carboxylate's role, which is dependent on the corepressor's orientation in the binding pocket, is apparently to position the guanidinium group of Arg-84 for favorable contacts with the operator's sugar-phosphate backbone."
https://openalex.org/W1579091669,"Escherichia coli tryptophan indole-lyase (tryptophanase) mutants, with cysteine residues 294 and 298 selectively replaced by serines, have been prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. Both mutant enzymes are highly active for beta-elimination reactions measured with both L-tryptophan and S-(o-nitrophenyl)-L-cysteine. The Cys-294----Ser mutant enzyme is virtually identical to the wild type with respect to pyridoxal phosphate binding (KCO = 2 microM), cofactor absorption spectrum (lambda max = 420 and 337 nm) and pH dependence (pK alpha = 7.3), pH profile for catalysis, and rate of bromopyruvic acid inactivation. In contrast, the Cys-298----Ser mutant enzyme exhibits a reduced affinity for pyridoxal phosphate (KCO = 6 microM), a shift in the cofactor absorption spectrum to 414 nm and an altered pK alpha = 8.5, an alkaline shift in the pH profile for catalysis, and resistance to inactivation of the apoenzyme by bromopyruvic acid. The C298S mutant enzyme (wherein cysteine 298 is altered to serine) also undergoes an isomerization to an unreactive state upon storage at 4 degrees C. These results demonstrate that the sulfhydryl groups of Cys-294 and Cys-298 are catalytically nonessential. However, these data suggest that Cys-298 is located within or very near the active site of the enzyme and is the reactive cysteine residue previously observed by others."
https://openalex.org/W1516614444,"Abstract Electrically permeabilized RINm5F cells were used to assess the factors required for activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and insulin secretion. PKC was activated either by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or by the generation of endogenous diacylglycerol in response to the nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analog guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S). As shown previously, both PMA and GTP gamma S elicit Ca2+-independent insulin secretion. This effect was mimicked by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) but not by guanosine 5'-O-(3-fluorotriphosphate) and guanosine 5'-O-(3-phenyltriphosphate) possessing only one negative charge in the gamma-phosphate group. The action of PMA was mediated by PKC, since the agent caused both phosphorylation of specific protein substrates and association of the enzyme with cellular membranes. This translocation was independent of the Ca2+ concentration employed. In contrast, GTP gamma S only promoted association of PKC with membranes at 10(-6) and 10(-5) M Ca2+ and failed to alter significantly protein phosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+. Neither Gpp(NH)p, which stimulates insulin release, nor the other two GTP analogs, increased the proportion of PKC associated with membranes. To verify that the Ca2+-dependent effect of GTP gamma S on PKC is due to activation of phospholipase C, we measured the generation of diacylglycerol. GTP gamma S indeed stimulated diacylglycerol production in the leaky cells by about 50% at Ca2+ concentrations between 10(-7) and 10(-5) M, an effect which was almost abolished in the absence of Ca2+. Thus, at 10(-7) M Ca2+, the concentration found in resting intact cells, the generated diacylglycerol was not sufficient to cause PKC insertion into the membrane, demonstrating that both elevated Ca2+ and diacylglycerol are necessary for translocation to occur. It is concluded that while PKC activation by PMA elicits Ca2+-independent insulin secretion, the kinase seems not to mediate the stimulatory action of GTP analogs in the absence of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1600420162,"The cultured myoblasts of the rat skeletal muscle cell line L6 proliferate till confluency and then fuse to form myotubes and express a number of muscle-specific proteins. We had shown that this differentiation process is blocked by specific metalloendoprotease inhibitors. We now demonstrate that metabolizing L6 myoblasts and their cell extracts degrade insulin to acid-soluble fragments by a non-lysosomal pathway. About 90% of the insulin-degrading activity residues in the cytoplasm and is due to a 110-kDa enzyme known as the insulin-degrading enzyme. The same metalloendoprotease inhibitors that block the differentiation of L6 myoblasts also inhibit insulin degradation by the metabolizing L6 cells, their cell extracts, and the insulin-degrading enzyme immunoprecipitated from the cytosolic extracts by a monoclonal antibody. These results suggest that the insulin-degrading enzyme is the metalloendoprotease whose activity is required for the initiation of the morphological and biochemical differentiation of L6 myoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1578031207,"Abstract Using cDNA cloning, ribonuclease protection, and Northern hybridization analysis, we showed that insulin gene expression occurs in yolk sac-derived fetal extraplacental membranes throughout the last half of rat fetal development. The mRNA product of the ancestral rat insulin II but not the duplicated rat insulin I gene was present in high copy number, and its abundance was regulated during development. Insulin mRNA was present in extraplacental membranes before pancreatic differentiation; membrane insulin mRNA content greatly exceeded that in pancreas until the last 2 days of gestation when content in each tissue became similar. Polyadenylation and intron splicing occurred at the same sites used in pancreas, but initiation of transcription occurred at multiple sites in membranes. Minces of membranes maintained in culture produced approximately 10 ng of radioimmunoassayable insulin/mg membrane protein/day. Over a 4-day period, approximately 50 times more insulin accumulated in medium than that present in membranes at the time of isolation. These studies indicate that yolk sac is a source for insulin during fetal development and that the mechanisms regulating insulin gene expression in this tissue differ from those in pancreatic beta cells."
https://openalex.org/W1596253765,"DNA photolyase catalyzes the photoreversal of pyrimidine dimers. The enzymes from Escherichia coli and yeast contain a flavin chromophore and a folate cofactor, 5,10-methenyltetrahydropteroylpolyglutamate. E. coli DNA photolyase contains about 0.3 mol of folate/mol flavin, whereas the yeast photolyase contains the full complement of folate. E. coli DNA photolyase is reconstituted to a full complement of the folate by addition of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate to cell lysates or purified enzyme samples. The reconstituted enzyme displays a higher photolytic cross section under limiting light. Treatment of photolyase with sodium borohydride or repeated camera flashing results in the disappearance of the absorption band at 384 nm and is correlated with the formation of modified products from the enzyme-bound 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. Photolyase modified in this manner has a decreased photolytic cross section under limiting light. Borohydride reduction results in the formation of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, both of which are released from the enzyme. Repeated camera flashing results in photodecomposition of the enzyme-bound 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and release of the decomposition products. Finally, it is observed that photolyase binds 10-formyltetrahydrofolate and appears to cyclize it to form the 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate chromophore."

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography of immunoprecipitates from [3H]palmitate-labeled platelets revealed two radiolabeled bands under reducing conditions at 24 and 19 kDa and two bands under nonreducing conditions at 170 and 19 kDa. As demonstrated by the parallel analysis of immunoprecipitates from periodate-[3H]sodium borohydride-labeled platelets, the [3H]palmitate-labeled bands obtained under reducing conditions corresponded to GP Ib beta and GP IX and the ones obtained under nonreducing conditions to intact GP Ib and GP IX, respectively. Using alkaline methanolysis followed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the methanolysis products, we demonstrated that the radioactivity associated with the GP Ib-IX complex from [3H]palmitate-labeled platelets was, in fact, covalently bound [3H]palmitate in ester linkage to protein. The protein-fatty acid linkage was also disrupted by hydroxylamine at neutral pH. Thus, this study demonstrates that GP Ib beta and GP IX in human platelets are both fatty acid-acylated with palmitate through thioester linkages."
https://openalex.org/W1568885376,"Abstract Pancreatic islets from ob/ob mice incubated with 3H2O and 5.5 mM glucose formed 3H-labeled glucose, 74 picoatoms incorporated/islet/h. Sixty-three percent of the 3H was bound to carbon 2 of the glucose. The amount of glucose-6-P dephosphorylated to glucose, determined from this incorporation, was 48 pmol/islet/h. Glucose utilization, measured by the formation of 3H2O from [5-3H]glucose, was 72 pmol/islet/h. The amount of glucose dephosphorylated was then about 40% of that phosphorylated. Thus, glucose-6-P is dephosphorylated to glucose to a significant extent by intact islets in vitro and presumably by the beta cells of the islets. The extent of this glucose cycling, i.e. glucose----glucose-6-P----glucose, may play a role in determining the extent of glucose-induced insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1533101300,"Abstract The type I and type II regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase can be distinguished by autophosphorylation. The type II regulatory subunits have an autophosphorylation site at a proteolytically sensitive hinge region, while the type I regulatory subunits have a pseudophosphorylation site. Only holoenzyme formed with type I regulatory subunits has a high affinity binding site for MgATP. In order to determine the functional consequences of regulatory subunit phosphorylation on interaction with the catalytic subunit, an autophosphorylation site was introduced into the type I regulatory subunit using recombinant DNA techniques. When Ala97 at the hinge region of the type I regulatory subunit was replaced with Ser, the regulatory subunit became a good substrate for the catalytic subunit. Stoichiometric phosphorylation occurred exclusively at Ser97. Radioactivity was incorporated primarily into the recombinant regulatory subunit when catalytic subunit and [gamma-32P]ATP were added to the total bacterial extract. Phosphorylation of the mutant regulatory subunit also occurred readily following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose. Phosphorylation occurred as an intramolecular event in the absence of cAMP indicating that the hinge region of the regulatory subunit occupies the substrate recognition site of the catalytic subunit in the holoenzyme complex. Holoenzyme formed with both the wild type and mutant regulatory subunits was susceptible to dissociation in the presence of high salt; however, only the native holoenzyme was stabilized by MgATP. In contrast to the wild type holoenzyme, the affinity of the mutant holoenzyme for cAMP was not reduced in the presence of MgATP. Holoenzyme formation also was not facilitated by MgATP."
https://openalex.org/W2026638408,"During frog embryogenesis, mesoderm is specified in the equatorial region of the early embryo by a signal from the vegetal hemisphere. Prospective ectodermal cells dissected from the animal hemisphere can be respecified to form mesodermal tissues by recombination with vegetal tissue or by treatment with any of several polypeptide growth factors or growth factor-like molecules. Together with the discovery that several developmental mutations in Drosophila are in genes with significant homology to mammalian mitogens and oncogenes, these observations suggest that early developmental signals may use similar transduction pathways to mitogenic signals characterized in cultured mammalian cells. Whether mesoderm can be induced by activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways implicated in mitogenesis and oncogenesis has been investigated with the viral oncogene polyoma middle T. Microinjection of middle T messenger RNA into early embryos results in the respecification of isolated prospective ectodermal tissue to form characteristic mesodermal structures. Middle T in frog blastomeres appears to associate with cellular activities similar to those observed in polyoma-transformed mouse cells, and transformation-defective middle T mutants fail to induce mesoderm. These results suggest that early inductive signals and mitogenic and oncogenic stimuli may share common signal transduction pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1523736322,"Abstract Thrombospondin (TSP) is a trimeric glycoprotein of Mr 420,000. It was originally described as a major component of human platelet alpha granules and is essential for the secondary phase of platelet aggregation. TSP is also synthesized and secreted by a variety of nucleated cells where it functions in processes involving growth and adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. Many of these processes are heparin-inhibitable and are mediated by a proteolytic fragment of TSP called the heparin binding domain (HBD). In order to facilitate the analysis of the structure and function(s) of this domain, we have expressed this molecule in Escherichia coli. A fragment of a TSP cDNA that encodes the heparin binding domain was inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pJBL6. In bacterial cells grown at 42 degrees C, this vector directs the synthesis of a 24,000-Da polypeptide. Milligram quantities of this protein were purified to homogeneity from E. coli lysates. The structure of the recombinant HBD was confirmed by protein sequencing. The protein was further characterized by analysis of its conformation and function. The recombinant HBD binds [3H]heparin with a Kd of 71 nM, almost identical to that of TSP-derived HBD (80 nM). Additionally, the recombinant HBD is able to compete for TSP binding to 11B carcinoma cells. These studies indicate that the recombinant HBD is synthesized and purified in a native configuration and is functionally equivalent to thrombospondin-derived HBD. They further indicate that glycosylation of the thrombospondin HBD is not necessary for its interaction with heparin and that sequences essential to this interaction reside within the first 229 amino acids of secreted thrombospondin."
https://openalex.org/W1486587808,"Isolated mature L-A viral particles from yeast have a transcriptase activity that uses endogenous L-A double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as template. We have previously demonstrated that empty particles derived from mature L-A viral particles have replicase activity capable of synthesizing minus strand single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) on an added plus strand ssRNA template to form dsRNA. We report here that empty particles also have transcriptase activity that uses added viral dsRNA as template. The newly synthesized ssRNA was the plus strand, and some of these transcripts were converted to the dsRNA form by the replicase activity associated with the empty particles. This transcriptase activity, however, required a much higher concentration of polyethylene glycol than that used previously for the replicase activity. The mode of transcription was conservative. The enzyme transcribed ssRNA from L-A, M1, or X (a deletion mutant of L-A) dsRNAs but not from other yeast dsRNAs (L-BC, T, or W), bacteriophage Phi6 dsRNAs, or animal rotavirus dsRNAs, indicating the same template specificity as that expected for the in vivo reaction. This assay system, and the replicase assay system, will allow us to study in vitro all the enzymatic reactions essential for the viral replication cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1602348579,"Abstract Ubiquitin is encoded as a variable, spacerless repeat of the gene terminating with an additional amino acid or as a gene coding for a single ubiquitin with a carboxyl-terminal extension of 52 to 80 amino acids. We report the identification and partial purification of enzymes that specifically hydrolyze the peptide bond between ubiquitin-ubiquitin conjugate (Ub-Ubase) or ubiquitin fusion proteins (Ub-Xase). The Ub-Ubase was separated from the Ub-Xase by dye-ligand-Sepharose chromatography. The Ub-Xase was purified further by affinity chromatography on ubiquitin-Sepharose. The fidelity of the endoprotease reaction was assessed by measuring the ability of the released ubiquitin to be activated by ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) which requires intact ubiquitin and by sequence analysis of the released carboxyl extension protein with 52 amino acids after endoproteolysis of human ubiquitin with 52-amino acid carboxyl extension. The failure of both Ub-Ubase and Ub-Xase to cleave a mutant ubiquitin-Gly-76----Ala-metallothionein showed that the endoproteases distinguish Gly-X from an Ala-X peptide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1504412300,"Abstract In response to microbial infection or mechanical injury, larvae of the fly, Phormia terranovae (Diptera), can induce de novo production of a group of antibacterial proteins including: peak I protein, diptericin A, diptericin B, diptericin C, and peak V protein. Administration of L-canavanine at the time of mechanical injury results in the incorporation of this arginine antagonist into these proteins. Canavanine replacement for arginine causes a total loss of detectable antibacterial activity for diptericin B and diptericin C, whereas diptericin A and peak V protein are severely inhibited. This loss in biological activity occurs in spite of the fact that canavanine stimulates induced protein synthesis. Analysis of the hydrolysate of diptericin A reveals that one-third of the 3 arginyl residues are replaced by canavanine. This investigation provides the first evidence that canavanine incorporation into a protein can impair its function."

The single crystals display variable morphology with varying pH. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group C222 with cell dimensions a = 141.4 A, b = 98.2 A, c = 103.5 A. Co-crystals have also been obtained in the presence of the inhibitor 5,8-dideazafolate (KI = 18 microM) under similar crystallization conditions. Crystals of a chemically modified enzyme, iodinated at Cys-21, were grown under similar conditions within the pH range 6.5-7.0. These crystals are isomorphous with the unmodified enzyme. Crystals suitable for high resolution (less than 2.5 A) x-ray diffraction studies have been obtained for each of the above."
https://openalex.org/W1510497666,"Abstract NADP+-specific glutamate dehydrogenase from Salmonella typhimurium, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, has been purified to homogeneity. The nucleotide sequence of S. typhimurium gdhA was determined and the amino acid sequence derived. The nucleotide analogue 2-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]-1,N6-ethenoadenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate (2-BDB-T epsilon A-2',5'-DP) reacts irreversibly with the enzyme to yield a partially inactive enzyme. After about 60% loss of activity, no further inactivation is observed. The rate of inactivation exhibits a nonlinear dependence on 2-BDB-T epsilon A-2',5'-DP concentration with kmax = 0.160 min-1 and KI = 300 microM. Reaction of 200 microM 2-BDB-T epsilon A-2',5'-DP with glutamate dehydrogenase for 120 min results in the incorporation of 0.94 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme subunit. The coenzymes, NADPH and NADP+, completely protect the enzyme against inactivation by the reagent and decrease the reagent incorporation from 0.94 to 0.5 mol of reagent/mol enzyme subunit, while the substrate alpha-ketoglutarate offers only partial protection. These results indicate that 2-BDB-T epsilon A-2',5'-DP functions as an affinity label of the coenzyme binding site and that specific reaction occurs at only about 0.5 sites/enzyme subunit or 3 sites/hexamer. Glutamate dehydrogenase modified with 200 microM 2-BDB-T epsilon A-2',5'-DP in the absence and presence of coenzyme was reduced with NaB3H4, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Labeled peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography and characterized by gas phase sequencing. Two peptides modified by the reagent were isolated and identified as follows: Phe-Cys(CM)-Gln-Ala-Leu-Met-Thr-Glu-Leu-Tyr-Arg and Leu-Cys(CM)-Glu-Ile-Lys. These two peptides were located within the derived amino acid sequence as residues 146-156 and 282-286. In the presence of NADPH, which completely prevents inactivation, only peptide 146-156 was labeled. This result indicates that modification of the pentapeptide causes loss of activity. Glutamate 284 in this peptide is the probable reaction target and is located within the coenzyme binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1494697908,"The effects of intracellular insulin on protein synthesis were examined in intact cells and isolated, undiluted cellular components. [35S]Methionine incorporation into protein was measured in Stage IV oocytes from Xenopus laevis maintained under paraffin oil. Radiolabel and insulin were introduced into the cytoplasm by microinjection. After a short delay (approximately 15 min), injected insulin stimulated the rate of methionine incorporation. Stimulation was dose-dependent, increasing with injected doses in the 7-50-fmol range. Neither proinsulin nor insulin-like growth factor 1 were as effective as insulin in stimulating protein synthesis; microinjected epidermal growth factor and the A and B chains of insulin were without effect. When oocyte surface membranes were removed under oil, the resulting cytoplasm-nucleus samples exhibited methionine incorporation rates that were comparable to those found in intact cells. Microinjection of insulin increased rates of methionine incorporation in cytoplasm-nucleus samples; the effects of external (prior to transfer to oil) and internal (microinjection in oil) insulin exposure were additive. Cytoplasm samples (nuclei and surface membranes removed under oil) also synthesized protein and responded to microinjected insulin. However, insulin responses were reduced relative to cells and to cytoplasm-nucleus samples. 125I-Insulin was degraded rapidly after microinjection into oocytes. Degradation occurred in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Degradation was delayed by injecting bacitracin into the cells and delaying degradation increased the effectiveness of a low dose of injected insulin. Together, the data show that insulin can act at external, nuclear, and cytoplasmic sites to stimulate protein synthesis in Xenopus oocytes. The signaling pathway activated by internal insulin does not involve plasma membrane-generated second messengers and appears to be separate from that activated by external hormone. Finally, although microinjected insulin is degraded rapidly, it is the intact hormone rather than a degradation product that stimulates protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1601651249,"Abstract DNA methylation in Escherichia coli plays a role in many key cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, restriction, and transcription. However, several mutant bacterial strains exist which are deficient in DNA methylase activities. Thus, it has been suggested that methylation produced by the dam (DNA adenine methylase) gene is required for the viability of E. coli and that dam- strains still produce low levels of methylation. Current experimental methods are not sensitive enough to detect a few potentially essential methylated sites per genome. Here we describe a method for the detection of N6-methyladenine at specific sites with a sensitivity of one site in more than 10 megabases. We show that methylation produced by both the dam and hsd (EcoK) genes is not required for the growth of E. coli and identify the site of EcoK modification. Minor adaptations of the technique should enable the identification of other rare DNA modifications."

https://openalex.org/W1585773097,"The present experiments were performed to identify calmodulin-binding proteins phosphorylated in response to insulin. Homogenates were prepared from 32Pi-labeled rat adipocytes. After centrifugation, the supernatants (+/- Ca2+) were applied to calmodulin-Sepharose columns. The bound proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphoproteins were visualized by autoradiography. Several proteins bound to the affinity resin in the presence of Ca2+, two bound +/- Ca2+, but only one protein, Mr = 170,000 (denoted pp170), bound in the absence of Ca2+. Binding of pp170 was inhibited by adding calmodulin (micromolar) or Ca2+ (nanomolar) to extracts prior to affinity chromatography. Physiological concentrations of insulin rapidly and reversibly increased (by as much as 4-fold) 32P-labeled pp170. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increased (up to 3-fold) phosphorylation of pp170; but 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate was without effect. Phosphorylation of pp170 in response to insulin and PMA occurred predominantly on serine residues; no phosphotyrosine was detected. Protein kinase C inhibitors attenuated PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of pp170, but had no effect on insulin-stimulated phosphorylation. Peptide mapping indicated that pp170 was phosphorylated on multiple sites and that insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of at least one site not phosphorylated in response to PMA. The results indicate that insulin and PMA stimulate the phosphorylation of pp170 via different pathways, the latter presumably via protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1500173903,"A tetrameric form of the ribosomal protein L7/L12 has been prepared and its structure studied by using hydrodynamic methods, photon correlation spectroscopy, and small angle x-ray scattering. The tetrameric nature of the protein preparation is confirmed by three independent determinations of its molecular weight, with analysis of accurate sedimentation equilibrium data giving the most reliable estimate. The species has a Stokes radius of 4.0 +/- 0.1 nm and an absolute frictional ratio of 1.7. Taken together, the hydrodynamic measurements suggest the possibility of a flat structure, and this is consistent with the x-ray scattering results. The molecule has a radius of gyration of 3.6 +/- 0.05 nm and a maximum dimension of 11-12 nm. A geometric model consisting of four elongated monomers, arranged in a plane, is proposed."

Protein cross-links were generated by treatment of intact ribosomal subunits with dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate. Proteins were extracted from the treated subunits and fractionated by Cm-cellulose chromatography. Cross-linked proteins in these fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis on two-dimensional diagonal Polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. Component members of cross-linked pairs were radiolabeled with 125I and identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and comparison with nonradioactive ribosomal protein markers. Seventeen pairs involving 16 of the 45 60 S subunit proteins were identified. Several proteins were detected in numerous cross-linked dimers and were used as foci for constructing a model depicting the arrangement of proteins within the 60 S ribosomal subunit. The model also incorporated previously published data on structure and function of proteins from the yeast 60 S subunit."
