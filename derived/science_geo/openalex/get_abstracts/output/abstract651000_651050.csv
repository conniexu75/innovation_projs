https://openalex.org/W3011720761,"Huge citizens expose to social media during a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China. We assess the prevalence of mental health problems and examine their association with social media exposure. A cross-sectional study among Chinese citizens aged≥18 years old was conducted during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020. Online survey was used to do rapid assessment. Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. More than 80% (95%CI:80.9%-83.1%) of participants reported frequently exposed to social media. After controlling for covariates, frequently SME was positively associated with high odds of anxiety (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.31–2.26) and CDA (OR = 1.91, 95%CI: 1.52–2.41) compared with less SME. Our findings show there are high prevalence of mental health problems, which positively associated with frequently SME during the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings implicated the government need pay more attention to mental health problems, especially depression and anxiety among general population and combating with “infodemic” while combating during public health emergency."
https://openalex.org/W3016811071,"Granzyme A lights a fire Cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells use several strategies to kill infected or transformed cells. One such pathway entails the delivery of a family of serine proteases called granzymes to target cells through perforin-mediated pores to induce a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Zhou et al. show that granzyme A cleaves and activates gasdermin B (GSDMB), a central player in the highly inflammatory cell death process known as pyroptosis (see the Perspective by Nicolai and Raulet). GSDMB expression was highly expressed in some tissues and could be up-regulated by interferon-γ. Enforced expression of GSDMB in cancer cells enhanced tumor clearance in a mouse model, suggesting that this pathway may be a target for future cancer immunotherapies.

Efficient storage and delivery require a balance of volumetric and gravimetric storage. Chen et al. designed a metal-organic framework with trialuminum nodes and a large hexadentate aromatic linker that optimizes both parameters. This material surpassed the U.S. Department of Energy targets for methane and had a deliverable capacity of 14% by weight for hydrogen. Science , this issue p. 297"
https://openalex.org/W3016718031,"Genomic havoc from one fateful mistake Many human tumors display scrambled genomes that arise from two distinct mutational processes. The first, the chromosome breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle, produces gene amplification and genomic instability. The second, chromothripsis, generates massive, clustered genomic rearrangements in one or a few chromosomes. Umbreit et al. hypothesized that these two processes are mechanistically related and tested this idea by recreating essential steps of the BFB cycle in cultured cells (see the Perspective by Paiano and Nussenzweig). They found that chromothripsis arises from a cascade of events that begins with aberrant chromosome bridge formation during mitosis, followed by chromosome fragmentation, DNA damage, chromosome missegregation, and the formation of micronuclei. They propose a model that explains how a single cell division error (chromosome bridge formation) can generate many hallmark features of cancer genomes.

https://openalex.org/W3017229457,"Caspases regulate cell death, immune responses, and homeostasis. Caspase-6 is categorized as an executioner caspase but shows key differences from the other executioners. Overall, little is known about the functions of caspase-6 in biological processes apart from apoptosis. Here, we show that caspase-6 mediates innate immunity and inflammasome activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that caspase-6 promotes the activation of programmed cell death pathways including pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis) and plays an essential role in host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) infection. In addition, caspase-6 promoted the differentiation of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs). Caspase-6 facilitated the RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM)-dependent binding of RIPK3 to ZBP1 via its interaction with RIPK3. Altogether, our findings reveal a vital role for caspase-6 in facilitating ZBP1-mediated inflammasome activation, cell death, and host defense during IAV infection, opening additional avenues for treatment of infectious and autoinflammatory diseases and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3017240771,"Signs of a metabolon in action Eukaryotic cells have a heterogeneous cytoplasm, with compartments large and small, membrane bound or not. Enzymes that catalyze the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides, which are needed in rapidly dividing cells, are known to assemble into loosely associated, multienzyme structures called purinosomes, but the extent to which these structures are metabolically active has been less certain. Pareek et al. performed metabolomics to trace how purines are synthesized within purinosomes and used sophisticated mass spectrometry imaging to directly observe hotspots of metabolic activity within frozen HeLa cells (see the Perspective by Alexandrov). They found evidence for metabolic channeling between enzymes, which limits equilibration of intermediates formed in purinosomes with the bulk cellular metabolite pool. This process occurs specifically within purinosomes associated with mitochondria, because the input metabolites, glycine, aspartate, and formate, come from mitochondrial metabolism. Such channeling may help cells control the ratio and abundance of purine nucleotides. Science , this issue p. 283 ; see also p. 241"
https://openalex.org/W3016895535,"Control of messenger RNA (mRNA) decay rate is intimately connected to translation elongation, but the spatial coordination of these events is poorly understood. The Ccr4-Not complex initiates mRNA decay through deadenylation and activation of decapping. We used a combination of cryo-electron microscopy, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays to examine the recruitment of Ccr4-Not to the ribosome via specific interaction of the Not5 subunit with the ribosomal E-site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae This interaction occurred when the ribosome lacked accommodated A-site transfer RNA, indicative of low codon optimality. Loss of the interaction resulted in the inability of the mRNA degradation machinery to sense codon optimality. Our findings elucidate a physical link between the Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome and provide mechanistic insight into the coupling of decoding efficiency with mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W3016693383,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive condition of chronic bronchitis, small airway obstruction, and emphysema that represents a leading cause of death worldwide. While inflammation, fibrosis, mucus hypersecretion, and metaplastic epithelial lesions are hallmarks of this disease, their origins and dependent relationships remain unclear. Here we apply single-cell cloning technologies to lung tissue of patients with and without COPD. Unlike control lungs, which were dominated by normal distal airway progenitor cells, COPD lungs were inundated by three variant progenitors epigenetically committed to distinct metaplastic lesions. When transplanted to immunodeficient mice, these variant clones induced pathology akin to the mucous and squamous metaplasia, neutrophilic inflammation, and fibrosis seen in COPD. Remarkably, similar variants pre-exist as minor constituents of control and fetal lung and conceivably act in normal processes of immune surveillance. However, these same variants likely catalyze the pathologic and progressive features of COPD when expanded to high numbers."
https://openalex.org/W3017342212,"Applications of biological knowledge, such as forensics, often require the determination of biological materials to a species level. As such, DNA-based approaches to identification, particularly DNA barcoding, are attracting increased interest. The capacity of DNA barcodes to assign newly encountered specimens to a species relies upon access to informatics platforms, such as BOLD and GenBank, which host libraries of reference sequences and support the comparison of new sequences to them. As parameterization of these libraries expands, DNA barcoding has the potential to make valuable contributions in diverse applied contexts. However, a recent publication called for caution after finding that both platforms performed poorly in identifying specimens of 17 common insect species. This study follows up on this concern by asking if the misidentifications reflected problems in the reference libraries or in the query sequences used to test them. Because this reanalysis revealed that missteps in acquiring and analyzing the query sequences were responsible for most misidentifications, a workflow is described to minimize such errors in future investigations. The present study also revealed the limitations imposed by the lack of a polished species-level taxonomy for many groups. In such cases, applications can be strengthened by mapping the geographic distributions of sequence-based species proxies rather than waiting for the maturation of formal taxonomic systems based on morphology."
https://openalex.org/W3016417719,"In many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle Trachemys scripta elegans (T. scripta), sex is determined by ambient temperature during embryogenesis. We previously showed that the epigenetic regulator Kdm6b is elevated at the male-producing temperature and essential to activate the male pathway. In this work, we established a causal link between temperature and transcriptional regulation of Kdm6b We show that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is phosphorylated at the warmer, female-producing temperature, binds the Kdm6b locus, and represses Kdm6b transcription, blocking the male pathway. Influx of Ca2+, a mediator of STAT3 phosphorylation, is elevated at the female temperature and acts as a temperature-sensitive regulator of STAT3 activation."
https://openalex.org/W3017227297,"There is little knowledge on socioeconomic differences in use of health care organized by different care schemes and on exclusive and concurrent use of health care at different schemes in different socioeconomic groups. In Finland, public, occupational and private schemes offer parallel outpatient primary health care services. Each scheme mainly reaches different population groups because of differences in availability, costs and gatekeeping. This study aimed to analyse how the probability of using health care organized by the three schemes differed by socioeconomic status in a working-age population. Individual-level register-based data on use of public, occupational and private outpatient primary health care during 2013 as well as data on sociodemographic covariates were linked for the total population aged 25–64 of the city of Oulu, Finland. Data were analysed with descriptive methods and multinomial logistic regression models. Those in the study population most often used only occupational care or only public care, or did not use any of the studied health care schemes at all. The lower the socioeconomic status, the higher was the probability of not using care or using only public care. The higher the socioeconomic status, the higher was the probability of using occupational care–either only occupational care or occupational care in combination with private care. Education, occupational class and income were all associated with care use also when adjusted for sociodemographic covariates and chronic disease, but income proved to be the strongest predictor of the three. The results reflect the design of the Finnish health care system, with a strong occupational health care scheme for the employed population contributing to inequality in use of health care and potentially to health inequality between socioeconomic groups."

https://openalex.org/W3016859443,"Domestic dogs have assisted humans for millennia. However, the extent to which these helpful behaviors are prosocially motivated remains unclear. To assess the propensity of pet dogs to actively rescue distressed humans without explicit training, this study tested whether sixty pet dogs would release their seemingly trapped owners from a large box. To examine the causal mechanisms that shaped this behavior, the readiness of each dog to open the box was tested in three conditions: 1) the owner sat in the box and called for help (distress test), 2) an experimenter placed high-value food rewards in the box (food test), and 3) the owner sat in the box and calmly read aloud (reading test). Dogs were as likely to release their distressed owner as to retrieve treats from inside the box, indicating that rescuing an owner may be a highly rewarding action for dogs. After accounting for opening ability, dogs released the owner more often when the owner called for help than when the owner read aloud calmly. In addition, opening latencies decreased with test number in the distress test but not the reading test. Thus, rescuing the owner could not be attributed solely to social facilitation, stimulus enhancement, or social contact-seeking behavior. Dogs displayed more stress behaviors in the distress test than in the reading test, and stress scores decreased with test number in the reading test but not in the distress test. This evidence of emotional contagion supports the hypothesis that rescuing the distressed owner was an empathetically-motivated prosocial behavior. Success in the food task and previous (in-home) experience opening objects were both strong predictors of releasing the owner. Thus, prosocial behavior tests for dogs should control for physical ability and previous experience."
https://openalex.org/W3016379451,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of visual function tests in intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). A total of 62 subjects (38 patients with iAMD and 24 controls) were included and underwent several functional assessments: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), low luminance visual acuity (LLVA), visual acuity (VA) measured with the Moorfields Vanishing Optotypes Acuity Charts (MAC), contrast sensitivity with the Pelli-Robson test, reading speed using the International Reading Speed texts (IReST) and mesopic and dark-adapted microperimetry (S-MAIA, CenterVue, Padova, Italy). Groups were compared using non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests and ROC analyses. Linear regression was used to control for confounding. Results showed that all visual function test performances except the IReST were significantly reduced in iAMD patients compared to controls (p < 0.05). These effects did not alter after controlling for age and sex. Best discrimination between iAMD and controls yield the combination of LLVA and contrast sensitivity as well as MAC-VA and contrast sensitivity (ROC area under the curve 0.95 and 0.93, respectively). Our results suggest that LLVA, MAC-VA, contrast sensitivity and mesopic and dark-adapted microperimetry can capture visual impairment characteristic for iAMD. Best discrimination against iAMD is achieved with a combination of two tests."
https://openalex.org/W3016416267,"Of the sub-species of Holarctic wolf, the Woolly wolf (Canis lupus chanco) is uniquely adapted to atmospheric hypoxia and widely distributed across the Himalaya, Qinghai Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and Mongolia. Taxonomic ambiguity still exists for this sub-species because of complex evolutionary history anduse of limited wild samples across its range in Himalaya. We document for the first time population genetic structure and taxonomic affinity of the wolves across western and eastern Himalayan regions from samples collected from the wild (n = 19) using mitochondrial control region (225bp). We found two haplotypes in our data, one widely distributed in the Himalaya that was shared with QTP and the other confined to Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand in the western Himalaya, India. After combining our data withpublished sequences (n = 83), we observed 15 haplotypes. Some of these were shared among different locations from India to QTP and a few were private to geographic locations. A phylogenetic tree indicated that Woolly wolves from India, Nepal, QTP and Mongolia are basal to other wolves with shallow divergence (K2P; 0.000–0.044) and high bootstrap values. Demographic analyses based on mismatch distribution and Bayesian skyline plots (BSP) suggested a stable population over a long time (~million years) with signs of recent declines. Regional dominance of private haplotypes across its distribution range may indicate allopatric divergence. This may be due to differences in habitat characteristics, availability of different wild prey species and differential deglaciation within the range of the Woolly wolf during historic time. Presence of basal and shallow divergence within-clade along with unique ecological requirements and adaptation to hypoxia, the Woolly wolf of Himalaya, QTP, and Mongolian regions may be considered as a distinct an Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU). Identifying management units (MUs) is needed within its distribution range using harmonized multiple genetic data for effective conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W3016663689,"Purpose To investigate whether estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki-67 expression discordance before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) correlates with prognosis and treatment of breast cancer patients. Methods The study cohort included 482 breast cancer patients at the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018. Core needle biopsies and excised tissue biopsies pre- and post-NAC were obtained. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine ER, PR and Ki-67 status. The relationship between biomarker discordance before and after NAC and clinicopathological features was compared retrospectively. Results ER (n = 482), PR (n = 482) and Ki-67 (n = 448) expression was assessed in the same lesion pre- and post-NAC. Discordance in the three markers pre- and post-NAC was observed in 50 (10.4%), 82 (17.0%) and 373 (77.4%) cases, respectively. Positive-to-negative PR expression changes were the most common type of discordance observed. The risk of death in patients with a PR positive-to-negative conversion was 6.58 times greater than for patients with stable PR expression. The risk of death in patients with increased Ki-67 expression following NAC treatment was 2.05 times greater than for patients with stable Ki-67 expression. Conclusion Breast cancer patients showed changes in ER, PR and/or Ki-67 status throughout NAC, and these changes possibly influenced disease-free survival and overall survival. A switch to negative hormone receptor expression with increased Ki-67 expression following NAC could be indicators of a worse prognosis. Biomarker expression investigations following NAC may potentially improve patient management and survival."
https://openalex.org/W3016883261,"Purpose Diabetic retinal neurodegeneration (DRN) has been demonstrated in eyes of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), even in the absence of diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, no studies have looked at the rate of change in retinal layers and presence/development of DR over time per quadrant of the macula. In this longitudinal study, we aimed to clarify whether the rate of DRN is associated with the development/presence of DR within 4 different quadrants of the retina. Methods 80 eyes of 40 patients with type 1 DM and no/minimal DR were included. At 4 visits over 6 years, SD-OCT and fundus images were acquired. Thickness of the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL), Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL) and Inner Plexiform Layer (IPL) was measured in a 1-6mm circle around the fovea overall and for each quadrant (superior, nasal, inferior, temporal). Fundus images were scored for the presence/absence of DR in these areas. Multilevel analyses were performed to determine the rate of change for each layer overall and per quadrant for eyes/quadrants without and with DR during the follow-up period. Results RNFL and GCL showed significant thinning over time, IPL significant thickening. These changes were more pronounced for GCL and IPL in eyes/quadrants with DR during the follow-up period. Conclusions RNFL and GCL both showed thinning over time, which was more pronounced in eyes with DR for GCL. This holds true even in regional parts of the retina, as quadrant analyses showed similar results, showing that structural DRN is associated with DR per quadrant independently."
https://openalex.org/W3017114811,"Platinum-based chemotherapies, including oxaliplatin, are a mainstay in the management of solid tumors and induce cell death by forming intrastrand dinucleotide DNA adducts. Despite their common use, they are highly toxic, and approximately half of cancer patients have tumors that are either intrinsically resistant or develop resistance. Previous studies suggest that this resistance is mediated by variations in DNA repair levels or net drug influx. Here, we aimed to better define the roles of nucleotide excision repair and DNA damage in platinum chemotherapy resistance by profiling DNA damage and repair efficiency in seven oxaliplatin-sensitive and three oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. We assayed DNA repair indirectly as toxicity and directly measured bulky adduct formation and removal from the genome by slot blot and repair capacity in an excision assay, and used excision repair sequencing (XR-seq) to map repair events genome-wide at single-nucleotide resolution. Using this combinatorial approach and proxies for oxaliplatin–DNA damage, we observed no significant differences in repair efficiency that could explain the relative sensitivities and chemotherapy resistances of these cell lines. In contrast, the levels of oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage were significantly lower in the resistant cells, indicating that decreased damage formation, rather than increased damage repair, is a major determinant of oxaliplatin resistance in these cell lines. XR-seq–based analysis of gene expression revealed up-regulation of membrane transport pathways in the resistant cells, and these pathways may contribute to resistance.

https://openalex.org/W3016481585,"Homelessness is one of the most disabling and precarious living conditions. The objective of this Delphi consensus study was to identify priority needs and at-risk population subgroups among homeless and vulnerably housed people to guide the development of a more responsive and person-centred clinical practice guideline.We used a literature review and expert working group to produce an initial list of needs and at-risk subgroups of homeless and vulnerably housed populations. We then followed a modified Delphi consensus method, asking expert health professionals, using electronic surveys, and persons with lived experience of homelessness, using oral surveys, to prioritize needs and at-risk sub-populations across Canada. Criteria for ranking included potential for impact, extent of inequities and burden of illness. We set ratings of ≥ 60% to determine consensus over three rounds of surveys.Eighty four health professionals and 76 persons with lived experience of homelessness participated from across Canada, achieving an overall 73% response rate. The participants identified priority needs including mental health and addiction care, facilitating access to permanent housing, facilitating access to income support and case management/care coordination. Participants also ranked specific homeless sub-populations in need of additional research including: Indigenous Peoples (First Nations, Métis, and Inuit); youth, women and families; people with acquired brain injury, intellectual or physical disabilities; and refugees and other migrants.The inclusion of the perspectives of both expert health professionals and people with lived experience of homelessness provided validity in identifying real-world needs to guide systematic reviews in four key areas according to priority needs, as well as launch a number of working groups to explore how to adapt interventions for specific at-risk populations, to create evidence-based guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3017109128,"Introduction Little is known of acupuncture patients’ experiences and opinions of clinical trials, and what may influence their compliance when participating in an acupuncture trial. Objectives To explore the potential factors that influence patients’ choice and determinants to participate in acupuncture clinical trials. Methods Ten qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with patients from acupuncture clinics in Beijing, who had previously participated in acupuncture clinical trials. Results Four main themes emerged from the interview data: effectiveness of the treatment, convenience of participating in a trial, doctor-participant communication, and participant acceptance of the treatment (or the trial). Effectiveness of acupuncture in treating the health condition was the most important factor for participant adherence. Pragmatics of treatment schedules, travel and attendance burden, together with confidence in the doctor’s ability additionally influenced trial and treatment compliance. Conclusions In-depth interviews suggest that treatment effectiveness, the pragmatics of attending treatment sessions, and the expertise and attitudes of acupuncturists are determining factors of participation and compliance in acupuncture clinical trials. Participants’ confidence in, and expectation of, acupuncture may facilitate compliance, while their fear of acupuncture and negative perceptions of the trial’s purpose may reduce treatment compliance. Compliance may be facilitated by enhanced doctor-patient communication, personalized treatment programs, and feedback on treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3016377249,"Non-invasive biomarkers will enable widespread screening and early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We hypothesized that the considerable loss of brain tissue in AD will result in detection of brain lipid components in urine, and that these will change in concert with CSF and brain biomarkers of AD. We examined urine dicarboxylic acids (DCA) of carbon length 3–10 to reflect products of oxidative damage and energy generation or balance that may account for changes in brain function in AD. Mean C4-C5 DCAs were lower and mean C7-C10 DCAs were higher in the urine from AD compared to cognitively healthy (CH) individuals. Moreover, mean C4-C5 DCAs were lower and mean C7-C9 were higher in urine from CH individuals with abnormal compared to normal CSF amyloid and Tau levels; i.e., the apparent urine changes in AD also appeared to be present in CH individuals that have CSF risk factors of early AD pathology. In examining the relationship between urine DCAs and AD biomarkers, we found short chain DCAs positively correlated with CSF Aβ42, while C7-C10 DCAs negatively correlated with CSF Aβ42 and positively correlated with CSF Tau levels. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation of C7-C10 DCAs with hippocampal volume (p < 0.01), which was not found in the occipital volume. Urine measures of DCAs have an 82% ability to predict cognitively healthy participants with normal CSF amyloid/Tau. These data suggest that urine measures of increased lipoxidation and dysfunctional energy balance reflect early AD pathology from brain and CSF biomarkers. Measures of urine DCAs may contribute to personalized healthcare by indicating AD pathology and may be utilized to explore population wellness or monitor the efficacy of therapies in clinical trials."

This study aimed to evaluate protection and immune response induced by Brucella ovis ΔabcBA (BoΔabcBA) encapsulated with alginate against the challenge with Brucella canis in mice and to assess the safety of this strain for dogs. Methods Intracellular growth of the vaccine strain BoΔabcBA was assessed in canine and ovine macrophages. Protection induced by BoΔabcBA against virulent Brucella canis was evaluated in the mouse model. Safety of the vaccine strain BoΔabcBA was assessed in experimentally inoculated dogs. Results Wild type B. ovis and B. canis had similar internalization and intracellular multiplication profiles in both canine and ovine macrophages. The BoΔabcBA strain had an attenuated phenotype in both canine and ovine macrophages. Immunization of BALB/c mice with alginate-encapsulated BoΔabcBA (108 CFU) induced lymphocyte proliferation, production of IL-10 and IFN-γ, and protected against experimental challenge with B. canis. Dogs immunized with alginate-encapsulated BoΔabcBA (109 CFU) seroconverted, and had no hematologic, biochemical or clinical changes. Furthermore, BoΔabcBA was not detected by isolation or PCR performed using blood, semen, urine samples or vaginal swabs at any time point over the course of this study. BoΔabcBA was isolated from lymph nodes near to the site of inoculation in two dogs at 22 weeks post immunization. Conclusion Encapsulated BoΔabcBA protected mice against experimental B. canis infection, and it is safe for dogs. Therefore, B. ovis ΔabcBA has potential as a vaccine candidate for canine brucellosis prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3016813674,"Hill’s thistle (Cirsium hillii (Canby) Fernald) is a perennial plant endemic to the Great Lakes region of North America. Hill’s thistle is listed as threatened in Ontario and Canada where it is found in globally rare alvar habitats. The main objective of this study was ex-situ conservation of Hill’s thistle using in vitro culture techniques and reintroduction of micropropagated plants back to their natural habitat in Bruce Peninsula National Park, Ontario, Canada. Two out of twenty-nine available seeds were successfully germinated under in vitro condition. An efficient micropropagation protocol was optimized with 100% survival during acclimatization of plantlets in the greenhouse. Three hundred micropropagated plants were reintroduced to twelve different sites within Bruce Peninsula National Park in June and July 2017. Plants were monitored for survival, rosette growth, and flowering on all sites from 2017–2019. After four months of planting, 67 to 99% of the plants were alive in different sites and 90 to 99% of them survived over winter. In the following years, shoot regeneration and flowering were observed on most sites. This study further confirms the benefit of plant tissue culture techniques to ensure revival of Hill’s thistle ecological biodiversity through the reintroduction of micropropagated plants. This approach consisting of the components of conservation, propagation, and reintroduction (CPR) may potentially serve as a model for saving and enriching other species at risk."
https://openalex.org/W3016880758,"Actively growing tumors are often histologically associated with Ki67 positivity, while the detection of invasiveness relies on non-quantitative pathologic evaluation of mostly advanced tumors. We recently reported that reduced expression of the Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding annexin A6 (AnxA6) is associated with increased expression of the Ca2+ activated RasGRF2 (GRF2), and that the expression status of these proteins inversely influence the growth and motility of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Here, we establish that the reciprocal expression of AnxA6 and GRF2 is at least in part, dependent on inhibition of non-selective Ca2+ channels in AnxA6-low but not AnxA6-high TNBC cells. Immunohistochemical staining of breast cancer tissues revealed that compared to non-TNBC tumors, TNBC tumors express lower levels of AnxA6 and higher Ki67 expression. GRF2 expression levels strongly correlated with high Ki67 in pretreatment biopsies from patients with residual disease and with residual tumor size following chemotherapy. Elevated AnxA6 expression more reliably identified patients who responded to chemotherapy, while low AnxA6 levels were significantly associated with shorter distant relapse-free survival. Finally, the reciprocal expression of AnxA6 and GRF2 can delineate GRF2-low/AnxA6-high invasive from GRF2-high/AnxA6-low rapidly growing TNBCs. These data suggest that AnxA6 may be a reliable biomarker for distant relapse-free survival and response of TNBC patients to chemotherapy, and that the reciprocal expression of AnxA6 and GRF2 can reliably delineate TNBCs into rapidly growing and invasive subsets which may be more relevant for subset-specific therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3016410065,"SHC adaptor protein (SHCA) and lipoma-preferred partner (LPP) mediate transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Reduced expression of either protein diminishes breast cancer lung metastasis, but the reason for this effect is unclear. Here, using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we found that TGFβ enhanced the assembly and disassembly rates of paxillin-containing adhesions in an SHCA-dependent manner through the phosphorylation of the specific SHCA tyrosine residues Tyr-239, Tyr-240, and Tyr-313. Using a BioID proximity labeling approach, we show that SHCA exists in a complex with a variety of actin cytoskeletal proteins, including paxillin and LPP. Consistent with a functional interaction between SHCA and LPP, TGFβ-induced LPP localization to cellular adhesions depended on SHCA. Once localized to the adhesions, LPP was required for TGFβ-induced increases in cell migration and adhesion dynamics. Mutations that impaired LPP localization to adhesions (mLIM1) or impeded interactions with the actin cytoskeleton via α-actinin (ΔABD) abrogated migratory responses to TGFβ. Live-cell TIRF microscopy revealed that SHCA clustering at the cell membrane preceded LPP recruitment. We therefore hypothesize that, in the presence of TGFβ, SHCA promotes the formation of small, dynamic adhesions by acting as a nucleator of focal complex formation. Finally, we defined a previously unknown function for SHCA in the formation of invadopodia, a process that also required LPP. Our results reveal that SHCA controls the formation and function of adhesions and invadopodia, two key cellular structures required for breast cancer metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W3016930085,"While overt instances of harassment and violence towards LGBQ+ individuals have decreased in recent years, subtler forms of heterosexism still shape the social and academic experience of students in higher education contexts. Such forms, defined as microaggressions, frequently include environmental slights that communicate hostile and derogatory messages about one’s sexual-minority status. However, there is some evidence suggesting that environmental microaggressions have deleterious effects on all students, regardless of their sexual orientation. The aim of the current study was to examine how heterosexist environmental microaggressions on campus contributed to heterosexual and non-heterosexual students’ negative perceptions of campus climate. We also analyzed whether the effect of microaggressions on campus climate was mediated by student social integration on campus. Data were collected in 2018 through an anonymous web-based survey that involved students from a large university of Southern Italy. The sample consisted of 471 students from 18 to 33 years old. Thirty-eight (8.1%) students self-identified as non-heterosexual. Measures included self-reported experiences of environmental microaggressions on campus, student degree of satisfaction with peer-group and student-faculty interactions, perceptions of faculty concern for student development, and of the overall campus climate. The structural equation model showed that heterosexist environmental microaggressions on campus were associated with negative perceptions of campus climate through lowered satisfaction with peer-group interactions and perceptions of faculty concern for student development, for both heterosexual and non-heterosexual students. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that heterosexist microaggressions within campus environments are negatively associated with students’ perceptions of campus climate, regardless of their sexual orientation. Both faculty and peers play an important role in creating an environment that supports the inclusivity of diversity and fosters a greater sense of belonging to the campus community."
https://openalex.org/W3016714772,"The Warburg effect, a hallmark of cancer, has recently been identified as a metabolic limitation of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, the primary platform for the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Metabolic engineering approaches, including genetic modifications and feeding strategies, have been attempted to impose the metabolic prevalence of respiration over aerobic glycolysis. Their main objective lies in decreasing lactate production while improving energy efficiency. Although yielding promising increases in productivity, such strategies require long development phases and alter entangled metabolic pathways which singular roles remain unclear. We propose to apply drugs used for the metabolic therapy of cancer to target the Warburg effect at different levels, on CHO cells. The use of α-lipoic acid, a pyruvate dehydrogenase activator, replenished the Krebs cycle through increased anaplerosis but resulted in mitochondrial saturation. The electron shuttle function of a second drug, methylene blue, enhanced the mitochondrial capacity. It pulled on anaplerotic pathways while reducing stress signals and resulted in a 24% increase of the maximum mAb production. Finally, the combination of both drugs proved to be promising for stimulating Krebs cycle activity and mitochondrial respiration. Therefore, drugs used in metabolic therapy are valuable candidates to understand and improve the metabolic limitations of CHO-based bioproduction."
https://openalex.org/W3016888476,"Elevated intraocular pressure is the only treatable risk factor for glaucoma, an eye disease that is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. We have identified cromakalim prodrug 1 (CKLP1), a novel water-soluble ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener, as a new ocular hypotensive agent. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of CKLP1 and its parent compound levcromakalim, Dutch-belted pigmented rabbits were treated intravenously (0.25 mg/kg) or topically (10 mM; 4.1 mg/ml) with CKLP1. Body fluids (blood, aqueous and vitreous humor) were collected at multiple time points and evaluated for the presence of CKLP1 and levcromakalim using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based assay. Histology of tissues isolated from Dutch-belted pigmented rabbits treated once daily for 90 days was evaluated in a masked manner by a certified veterinary pathologist. The estimated plasma parameters following intravenous administration of 0.25 mg/kg of CKLP1 showed CKLP1 had a terminal half-life of 61.8 ± 55.2 min, Tmax of 19.8 ± 23.0 min and Cmax of 1968.5 ± 831.0 ng/ml. Levcromakalim had a plasma terminal half-life of 85.0 ± 37.0 min, Tmax of 61.0 ± 32.0 min and Cmax of 10.6 ± 1.2 ng/ml. Topical CKLP1 treatment in the eye showed low levels (<0.3 ng/mL) of levcromakalim in aqueous and vitreous humor, and trace amounts of CKLP1 and levcromakalim in the plasma. No observable histological changes were noted in selected tissues that were examined following topical application of CKLP1 for 90 consecutive days. These results suggest that CKPL1 is converted to levcromakalim in the eye and likely to some extent in the systemic circulation."
https://openalex.org/W3016892612,"Introduction Risk reduction towards safer behaviour is promoted after enrolment in HIV prevention trials. We evaluated sexual behaviour, changes in sexual behaviour and factors associated with risky behaviour after one-year of follow-up among women enrolled in HIV prevention trials in Northern Tanzania. Methods Self-reported information from 1378 HIV-negative women aged 18–44 enrolled in microbicide and vaccine feasibility studies between 2008–2010,was used to assess changes in behaviour during a 12-month follow-up period. Logistic regression with random intercepts was used to estimate odds ratios for trends in each behaviour over time. A behavioural risk score was derived from coefficients of three behavioural variables in a Poisson regression model for HIV incidence and thereafter, dichotomized to risky vs less-risky behaviour. Logistic regression was then used to identify factors associated with risky behaviour at 12 months. Results At baseline, 22% reported multiple partners, 28% were involved in transactional sex and only 22% consistently used condoms with non-regular partners. The proportion of women reporting multiple partners, transactional sex and high-risk sex practices reduced at each 3-monthly visit (33%, 43% and 47% reduction in odds per visit respectively, p for linear trend <0.001 for all), however, there was no evidence of a change in the proportion of women consistently using condoms with non-regular partners (p = 0.22). Having riskier behaviours at baseline, being younger than 16 years at sexual debut, having multiple partners, selling sex and excessive alcohol intake at baseline were strongly associated with increased odds of risky sexual behaviour after 12 months (p<0.005 for all). Conclusion An overall reduction in risky behaviours over time was observed in HIV prevention cohorts. Risk reduction counselling was associated with decreased risk behaviour but was insufficient to change behaviours of all those at highest risk. Biological HIV prevention interventions such as PrEP for individuals at highest risk, should complement risk reduction counselling so as to minimize HIV acquisition risk."
https://openalex.org/W3017164214,"To develop a technique to compare the intra-tumoral distribution of the drug gemcitabine, its surrogate [18F]-fluoroarabinocytosine ([18F]-FAC) and related chemotherapeutics 5-FU and capecitabine in a pre-clinical model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Using a KPC-organoid derived model of PDAC, we obtained autoradiographic images of the tumor distribution of, [14C]-gemcitabine, [14C]-5-FU, [3H]-capecitabine. These were compared indirectly by co-administering [18F]-FAC, a close analog of gemcitabine with a proven equivalent intra-tumor distribution. The short half-life of 18F allows for clean separation of 3H/14C labeled drugs in specimens by dual isotope digital autoradiography. Autoradiographic images of [14C]-gemcitabine, [3H]-capecitabine and [14C]-5-FU were each correlated to [18F]-FAC on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The tumor drug penetration was compared using cumulative histograms.Gemcitabine distribution correlated strongly with FAC as expected. 5-FU also gave a similar microdistribution to that of FAC, whereas no correlation was found between capecitabine or its metabolic products and FAC distribution. Accumulation of Gemcitabine and 5-FU was lower in hypoxic regions of the tumor, whereas no such correlation was observed for capecitabine and its metabolites.Gemcitabine and 5-FU target the same regions of the tumor, leaving hypoxic cells untreated. Capecitabine metabolites penetrate further into the tumor but it is yet to be determined whether these metabolites are the active form of the drug."
https://openalex.org/W3016705130,"Software systems are often developed in such a way that good practices in the object-oriented paradigm are not met, causing the occurrence of specific disharmonies which are sometimes called code smells. Design patterns catalogue best practices for developing object-oriented software systems. Although code smells and design patterns are widely divergent, there might be a co-occurrence relation between them. The objective of this paper is to empirically evaluate if the presence of design patterns is related to the presence of code smells at different granularity levels. We performed an empirical study using 20 design patterns and 13 code smells in ten small-size to medium-size, open source Java-based systems. We applied statistical analysis and association rules. Results confirm that classes participating in design patterns have less smell-proneness and smell frequency than classes not participating in design patterns. We also noticed that every design pattern category act in the same way in terms of smell-proneness in the subject systems. However, we observed, based on the association rules learning and the proposed validation technique, that some patterns may be associated with certain smells in some cases. For instance, Command patterns can co-occur with God Class, Blob and External Duplication smell."
https://openalex.org/W3017167242,"Background Night shift work surrounding pregnancy may contribute to the risk of developing atopic diseases in offspring due to alterations in the prenatal environment, from stress. Objective To examine the association of maternal night shift work surrounding pregnancy and offspring risk of developing atopic diseases from childhood to adolescence. Methods We examined the association between night shift work before and during pregnancy among 4,044 mothers in the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) and atopic dermatitis, asthma and hay fever risk in 4,813 of their offspring enrolled in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS). Mothers reported whether GUTS participants had ever been diagnosed with atopic dermatitis, asthma or hay fever in the GUTS Mothers’ questionnaire. Generalized estimating equation regression models were used to estimate multivariable adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results There were no significant associations between pre-conception maternal night shift work and risk of atopic dermatitis, asthma or hay fever in their offspring. Among 545 mothers with information on night shift work during pregnancy, shift work also was not associated with atopic dermatitis, asthma or hay fever in the offspring. Stratified analyses by history of parental atopy and maternal chronotype showed some statistically significant findings, but they were inconsistent and no significant interaction was seen with increasing duration of night shift work. Conclusion In this study, night shift work before and during pregnancy did not increase offspring risk of developing atopic dermatitis, asthma or hay fever."
https://openalex.org/W3014937433,"Background Theories of health outcomes often hypothesize that living in more socially and economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods will lead to worse health. Multiple measures of neighbourhood disadvantage are available to researchers, which may serve as better or worse proxies for each other across time. To inform longitudinal study design and interpretation we investigated how perceived and objective measures of neighbourhood disadvantage vary over time and the factors underlying this variation. Methods Data were from 8,918 mothers with at least three time-points of neighbourhood data in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children in the UK. We analyzed measures of objective (Indices of Multiple Deprivation) and perceived (neighbourhood quality, social cohesion, and stress) exposure to neighbourhood disadvantage at 10 time-points over 18 years. We used group-based trajectory modelling to determine the overlap in participants' trajectories on the different measures and evaluated the baseline factors associated with different perceived trajectories over time. Results There was evidence of heterogeneity in both perceived and objective measures of neighbourhood disadvantage over time (e.g., on the objective measure, 5% of participants moved to more deprived neighbourhoods, 11% moved to less deprived neighbourhoods, 20% consistently lived in deprived neighbourhoods, and 64% consistently lived in non-deprived neighbourhoods). Perceived social cohesion showed the weakest relationship with exposure to objective neighbourhood deprivation: most participants in each trajectory group of objective neighbourhood deprivation followed non-corresponding trajectories of perceived social cohesion (61–80%). Accounting for objective deprivation exposure, poorer socioeconomic and psychosocial indicators at baseline were associated with following more negative perceived neighbourhood trajectories (e.g., high neighbourhood stress) over time. Conclusion Trajectories of perceived and objective measures of neighbourhood disadvantage varied over time, with the extent of variation depending on the time point of measurement and individual-level social factors. Researchers should be mindful of this variation when choosing and determining the timing of measures of neighbourhood disadvantage in longitudinal studies and when inferring effect mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3016388944,"Background Large local reactions (LLR) to Hymenoptera stings were considered as IgE-mediated late-phase inflammatory reactions. However, in older studies, most patients with LLR were skin test positive, but only around 50% had detectable sIgE determined by the RAST system. Methods Data of 620 patients were evaluated retrospectively: 310 patients who suffered from LLR and 310 patients with previous systemic sting reactions (SSR). We aimed to clarify if sIgE can generally be detected by the CAP system in patients with LLR; sIgE levels and clinical parameters were compared between patients with LLR and SSR. Results Positive sIgE levels were detected in 80.7% of patients with LLR, and in 95.2% of patients with SSR (p<0.001). Of the 310 patients with LLR, 80.6% had a LLR with a size of 10-20cm, whereas 19.4% had swellings >20cm, with a mean duration of seven days. In only 2.9% of patients, LLRs occurred after stings on the trunk, while 14.8% of SSR resulted from stings on this site (p<0.001). Similarly, LLR were also less frequent on the capillitium compared to SSR (8.1% versus 26.2%; p = 0.035) Conclusions LLR usually persisted over seven days and about one fifth of patients had swellings greater than 20cm. Contrary to SSR, LLR were less frequently observed on the capillitium and on the trunk. In most patients with LLR, sIgE could be detected. However, total IgE and sIgE levels to bee or vespid venom did not differ between patients with LLR and SSR."

EAC show an increasing incidence in the Western World and median survival rates are still low. The main reasons for poor prognosis despite new multimodal therapies are diagnosis of EACs at an already advanced stage and distant metastases. Hence, we wanted to investigate the presence of systemic inflammatory interleukins (IL) and their impact on patient prognosis.Systemic expression levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A and IL-22) in the sera of 43 EAC patients without neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy were measured by flow cytometric analysis. A correlation to clinicopathological data was performed. Log-rank and Cox regression analysis were used to investigate the impact on patient survival. 43 sera of age and gender matched healthy volunteers were used as controls.Increased systemic IL-6 (p = 0.044) and lower IL-17A (p = 0.002) levels were found in EAC patients as opposed to controls. A correlation of IL-10 levels with an increased T stage was found (p = 0.020). Also, systemic IL-10 levels were highly elevated in patients with distant metastasis (p<0.001). However, only systemic IL-17A levels had an influence on patient survival in multivariate analysis.Systemic IL-6 levels are increased, while IL-17A levels are reduced in EAC patients compared to healthy controls. In addition, circulating IL-10 might help to identify patients with advanced disease and high IL-17A might indicate a limited prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3016689983,"Understanding of interactional dynamics between several processes is one of the most important challenges in psychology and psychosomatic medicine. Researchers exploring behavior or other psychological phenomena mostly deal with ordinal or interval data. Missing values and consequential non-equidistant measurements represent a general problem of longitudinal studies from this field. The majority of process-oriented methodologies was originally designed for equidistant data measured on ratio scales. Therefore, the goal of this article is to clarify the conditions for satisfactory performance of longitudinal methods with data typical in psychological and psychosomatic research. This study examines the performance of the Johansen test, a procedure incorporating a set of sophisticated time series techniques, in reference to data quality utilizing a Monte Carlo method. The main results of the conducted simulation studies are: (1) Time series analyses require samples of at least 70 observations for an accurate estimation and inference. (2) Discrete data and failing equidistance of measurements due to irregular missing values appear unproblematic. (3) Relevant characteristics of stationary processes can be adequately captured using 5- or 7-point ordinal scales. (4) For trending processes, at least 10-point scales are necessary to ensure an acceptable quality of estimation and inference."

There are no routinely used targeted clinical therapies for TNBC; thus there is a clear need to identify prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets.We evaluated expression of 27,016 genes in 155 treatment-naïve TN tumors from AA women in Detroit. Associations with survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for stage and age at diagnosis, and p-values were corrected using a false discovery rate. Our validation sample consisted of 494 TN tumors using four publically available data sets. Meta-analyses were performed using summary statistics from the four validation results.In the Detroit AA cohort, CLCA2 [Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-1.86, nominal p = 5.1x10-7, FDR p = 0.014], SPIC [HR = 1.47, 95%CI 1.26-1.73, nominal p = 1.8x10-6, FDR p = 0.022], and MIR4311 [HR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.31-1.92, nominal p = 2.5x10-5, FDR p = 0.022] expression were associated with overall survival. Further adjustment for treatment and breast cancer specific survival analysis did not substantially alter effect estimates. CLCA2 was also associated with increased risk of death in the validation cohorts [HR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24, p = 0.038, p-heterogeneity = 0.88].We identified CLCA2 as a potential prognostic marker for TNBC in AA women."
https://openalex.org/W3017034424,"Objective The interrelation and clinical utility of the parameters for superior migration of the humeral head, such as the acromiohumeral interval (AHI), inferior glenohumeral distance (IGHD), and upward migration index (UMI), in the management of massive rotator cuff tears are not clear. The objectives of this study were to identify the relation between AHI, IGHD, and UMI when measured with radiography and MRI and to determine whether superior migration can predict the irreparability of massive rotator cuff tears. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the files of 64 consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic partial or complete repair for massive rotator cuff tears at our institution between August 2015 and August 2018. We recorded both radiography and MRI measurements of AHI, IGHD, and UMI, and further the tangent sign, fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles, and the Patte grade. We performed correlation assessments and multiple logistic regression analysis to identify potential predictors of the reparability of massive rotator cuff tears. Results Thirty-five patients had partially reparable and 29 had completely reparable tears. Parameters measured with either radiography or MRI were highly correlated with each other. The radiographic measurements showed a moderate or low correlation with the MRI measurements. All parameters of superior migration of the humeral head on radiography and MRI, the tangent sign, fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus muscle, and the Patte grade showed significant differences between patients with partially and completely repaired tears. Among these, the independent predictors for irreparability was Patte grade = 3. Conclusion The AHI, IGHD, and UMI were highly correlated when measured with either radiography or MRI, but not when comparing their radiographic with their MRI values. Furthermore, they were not independent indicators of reparability in massive rotator cuff tears."
https://openalex.org/W3016805270,"Adherence to treatment is a crucial factor for patients who have chronic illnesses or multiple morbidities and polypharmacy, which is frequently found in older adults. The non-adherence to medications has important economic and social consequences as well as impacts on the health of the patients. One of the reasons that can explain the low adherence to treatment, is the memory deficits that are characteristics of this population and that are even more evident in cases that involve neurodegenerative diseases.In this study, we explore whether the differential outcomes procedure (DOP), which has been shown to be useful in improving discriminative learning and memory in different populations, may facilitate learning and retention of medical recommendations in older adults who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The results demonstrate that when this procedure was applied, the patients showed improvements in learning and long-term retention of two pill/time of day associations in a situation that simulates adherence to medical prescriptions.These findings contribute new data about the potential benefits of the DOP in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting the important role that this procedure could play in addressing important issues related to the health and quality of life of older adults, with or without neurodegenerative diseases, such as low adherence to medical treatments."

https://openalex.org/W3016972599,"Quantitative evaluation using image biomarkers calculated from threshold-segmented low-attenuation areas on chest computed tomography (CT) images for diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) has been widely investigated. However, the segmentation results depend on the applied threshold and slice thickness of the CT images because of the partial volume effect (PVE). In this study, the air volume fraction (AV/TV) of lungs was calculated from CT images using a two-compartment model (TCM) for COPD diagnosis. A relative air volume histogram (RAVH) was constructed using the AV/TV values to describe the air content characteristics of lungs. In phantom studies, the TCM accurately calculated total cavity volumes and foam masses with percent errors of less than 8% and ±4%, respectively. In patient studies, the relative volumes of normal and damaged lung tissues and the damaged-to-normal RV ratio were defined and calculated from the RAVHs as image biomarkers, which correctly differentiated COPD patients from controls in 2.5- and 5-mm-thick images with areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of >0.94. The AV/TV calculated using the TCM can prevent the effect of slice thickness, and the image biomarkers calculated from the RAVH are reliable for diagnosing COPD."

We aimed to screen for Mtb clearance markers from in-vitro-infected leucocytes and to evaluate these markers in followed-up active TB (ATB) patients and latent TB (LTBI) cases after anti-TB drug treatment. Extracellular proteins from primary leucocytes infected with each of the Mtb lineages (East-Asian, Indo-Oceanic, Euro-American and the laboratory strain H37Rv) were screened as possible clearance markers. Leucocytes infected with Staphylococcus aureus acted as controls. The proteomic analysis was performed using GeLC-MS/MS. Several quantitative and qualitative candidate clearance markers were found. These proteins were suppressed during the infection stage of all Mtb lineages and re-expressed after bacillary clearance. PSTK, FKBP8 and MGMT were common clearance markers among the four Mtb lineages in our model. Only PSTK was a potential clearance marker based on western blot validation analysis from culture supernatants. The PSTK marker was further validated with western blot analysis using serum samples (n = 6) from ATB patients and LTBI cases during anti-TB drug treatment, and from healthy controls (n = 3). Time-dependent increase of PSTK was found both in ATB and LTBI patients during the course of anti-TB drug treatment, but not in healthy controls.

There were some remarkable differences among the 98 Danish municipalities.We found some match between need and use for total contacts, inpatient contacts (> 1 day), contacts with general practitioner, and medication use although the associations were relatively weak. For outpatient and specialist contacts, the mismatch may be related to services not addressing potentially fatal disease whereas for vaccination there was a small mismatch. Our results indicate local discrepancies in diagnosis, and a low adjusted utilisation of hospital admissions in Aarhus compared to the other three major cities in Denmark suggests that a comparison of the organisation of services could be useful."

However, it remains controversial whether nutrition therapy protocols are effective in improving clinical outcomes. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a surgical ICU nutrition protocol, and to compare the hospital mortality, hospital LOS, and ICU LOS of protocol and non-protocol groups.A randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Surgical ICU, Siriraj Hospital. The nutrition administration of the control group was at the discretion of the attending physicians, whereas that of the intervention group followed the ""Siriraj Surgical ICU Nutrition Protocol"". Details of the demographic data, nutritional data, and clinical outcomes were collected.In all, 170 patients underwent randomization, with 85 individuals each in the protocol and non-protocol groups. More than 90% of the patients in both groups were at risk of malnutrition, indicated by a score of ≥ 3 on the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 tool. The average daily calories of the 2 groups were very similar (protocol group, 775.4±342.2 kcal vs. control group, 773.0±391.9 kcal; p = 0.972). However, the median time to commence enteral nutrition was shorter for the protocol group (1.94 days) than the control group (2.25 days; p = 0.503). Enteral nutrition was provided within the first 48 hours to 53.7% of the protocol patients vs. 47.4% of the control patients (p = 0.589). In addition, a higher proportion of the protocol patients (36.5%) reached the 60% calorie-target on Day 4 after admission than that for the non-protocol group (25.9%; p = 0.136). All other clinical outcomes and nutrition-related complications were not significantly different.The implementation of the nutrition protocol did not improve the feeding effectiveness or clinical outcomes as compared to usual nutrition management practices of the Surgical ICU."
https://openalex.org/W3016526370,"Daniel S. Greenberg, pioneering journalist, author, and a founding editor of Science 's news section, died on 9 March at his home in Washington, D.C. He was 88. Dan was among the first reporters to write about the productive but sometimes troubled relationship between basic research and the U.S. government, and for more than five decades he was an influential, often acerbic, observer of research policy and the research community itself.

Dan's career as a science journalist began in 1961 when he was hired by Science with the vague remit to write about issues involving science and scientists. He was not an obvious choice: He had no formal scientific training—he graduated from Columbia University in 1953 with a degree in English—and later admitted that he had not even heard of Science at the time. But he did have 6 years of reporting experience at an evening newspaper in Wilmington, Delaware, and The Washington Post , as well as an intimate knowledge of Washington politics, having spent a year working as a congressional fellow. Soon after Dan joined Science , the editor who had hired him left; he was on his own.

With the support of Philip Abelson, who was appointed Science 's editor-in-chief in 1962, Dan built up the news section, then called News and Comment, into an authoritative and insightful source of information and analysis of government policies for basic research and the U.S. research enterprise. Dan led a small, talented team of reporters in covering a wide range of issues, including the space program; the growth of the National Institutes of Health; the channeling of scientific advice into the government; and the expensive project-turned-fiasco called Mohole, which aimed at drilling through Earth's crust.

At the time, the idea of a journalist-written section in a publication devoted to publishing research papers was highly unusual, and so was the approach that Dan and his team took. They covered basic research policy in much the same way a business reporter would cover development of economic policy: as a set of competing interests. Federal funding of basic research had ballooned in the postwar years, and scientists had become advisers to the expanding science bureaucracy. The fierce competition for government dollars led some scientists to become lobbyists for particular projects and disciplines, in stark contrast to the image of the scientist as a dispassionate seeker of the truth.

Dan laid out this viewpoint in his 1967 book, The Politics of Pure Science , which drew heavily on his reporting for Science . It became a widely acclaimed and discussed work. (I first came across it in 1968 as a student at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, where it was recommended reading for a course on science policy.) However, it was not greeted with universal enthusiasm. In a preface to the second edition, Dan noted that it sparked “reactions that flowed from the belief that the scientific community should be exempt from the types of journalistic inquiries that are commonplace to other segments of our society.” He called that attitude “nonsense.”



Dan left Science in 1970 and launched the biweekly newsletter Science and Government Report ( SGR ), through which he continued to chronicle developments in the basic research enterprise, many of which he found troubling, such as paid lobbying of Congress for projects that had not been peer reviewed and growing corporate influence on academic research. Dan wrote SGR himself, with the help of multiple sources within the government and academia. His wife, Wanda Reif, a lawyer and former congressional aide, provided management and business support.

Although its circulation never exceeded 2000 readers, SGR flourished in the preinternet days when expensive newsletters were a critical source of insider information. It was a must read for anybody interested in science policy. Dan sold SGR in 1997 and distilled much of his reporting into two books, Science, Money, and Politics (published in 2001) and Science for Sale (published in 2007). The Politics of Pure Science , long out of print, was republished in 1999.

Dan's writing style was unmistakable: direct, often critical, and sometimes bemused. It could also be funny: He satirized the endless thirst for research grants through the exploits of a character he called Dr. Grant Swinger, Director of the Center for the Absorption of Federal Funds. And he loved to skewer pompous scientists and officials by printing extracts from speeches under the headline “High Vacuum Oratory.”

His legacy goes beyond a vast collection of published writing. Dan influenced other publications' coverage of basic research and was a role model and mentor to many young science writers, myself included. I first met him in the early 1970s when I was a correspondent for Nature based in Washington, D.C. Like Science, Nature had launched a news section written by journalists. Dan's advice to a rather green young reporter finding his way through the complexities of the U.S. research system proved invaluable, as did Dan and Wanda's friendship over subsequent decades.

We would meet over dinner in Washington, D.C., and Dan would offer amused, sometimes outraged, and always insightful comments about people and the background to decisions in science policy. Our discussions over the years usually involved events we had already covered—we were writing for similar audiences, and Dan, a competitive journalist, was not about to give away his upcoming stories; nor was I.

Warm and unpretentious, Dan had an infectious sense of humor. He was a proud father and grandfather, with four daughters from his previous marriage, a stepdaughter, and 18 grandchildren. He was also devoted to his Labrador dogs, Walter and Ben, named after the journalist Walter Lippmann and Benjamin Franklin.

Dan died before the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States. Wanda says she misses the discussions they would have had about the pandemic and the government's response. Dan would have had plenty of interesting things to say."
