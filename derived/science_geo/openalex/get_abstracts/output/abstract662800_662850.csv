https://openalex.org/W3096867322,"Zoonotic introduction of novel coronaviruses may encounter preexisting immunity in humans. Using diverse assays for antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we detected preexisting humoral immunity. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S)-reactive antibodies were detectable using a flow cytometry-based method in SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals and were particularly prevalent in children and adolescents. They were predominantly of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) class and targeted the S2 subunit. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced higher titers of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies targeting both the S1 and S2 subunits, and concomitant IgM and IgA antibodies, lasting throughout the observation period. SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor sera exhibited specific neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes. Distinguishing preexisting and de novo immunity will be critical for our understanding of susceptibility to and the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3096712778,"β-Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Much is known regarding their cellular entry and replication pathways, but their mode of egress remains uncertain. Using imaging methodologies and virus-specific reporters, we demonstrate that β-coronaviruses utilize lysosomal trafficking for egress rather than the biosynthetic secretory pathway more commonly used by other enveloped viruses. This unconventional egress is regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase Arl8b and can be blocked by the Rab7 GTPase competitive inhibitor CID1067700. Such non-lytic release of β-coronaviruses results in lysosome deacidification, inactivation of lysosomal degradation enzymes, and disruption of antigen presentation pathways. β-Coronavirus-induced exploitation of lysosomal organelles for egress provides insights into the cellular and immunological abnormalities observed in patients and suggests new therapeutic modalities."

Inhibition of RecBCD by phages triggers retron defense Retrons are bacterial genetic elements comprised of a reverse transcriptase (RT) and a non-coding RNA (ncRNA). The RT uses the ncRNA as template, generating a chimeric RNA/DNA molecule in which the RNA and DNA components are covalently linked. Although retrons were discovered three decades ago, their function remained unknown. We report that retrons function as anti-phage defense systems. The defensive unit is composed of three components: the RT, the ncRNA, and an effector protein. We examined multiple retron systems and show that they confer defense against a broad range of phages via abortive infection. Focusing on retron Ec48, we show evidence that it “guards” RecBCD, a complex with central anti-phage functions in bacteria. Inhibition of RecBCD by phage proteins activates the retron, leading to abortive infection and cell death. Thus, the Ec48 retron forms a second line of defense that is triggered if the first lines of defense have collapsed.

Retrons are genetic elements composed of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and a specialized reverse transcriptase (RT). These elements typically generate a chimeric RNA-DNA molecule, in which the RNA and DNA components are covalently attached by a 2′-5′ phosphodiester bond (Figure S1). Retrons were originally discovered in 1984 in Myxococcus xanthus, when Yee et al., 1984Yee T. Furuichi T. Inouye S. Inouye M. Multicopy single-stranded DNA isolated from a gram-negative bacterium, Myxococcus xanthus.Cell. 1984; 38: 203-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar identified a short, multi-copy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) that is abundantly present in the bacterial cell. Further studies showed that this single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is covalently linked to an RNA molecule (Dhundale et al., 1987Dhundale A. Lampson B. Furuichi T. Inouye M. Inouye S.

It was found that the retron ncRNA is the precursor of the hybrid molecule and folds into a typical structure that is recognized by the RT (Hsu et al., 1989Hsu M.Y. Inouye S. Inouye M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 6214-6219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RT then reverse transcribes part of the ncRNA, starting from the 2′-end of a conserved guanosine residue found immediately after a double-stranded RNA structure within the ncRNA (Lampson et al., 1989Lampson B.C. Inouye M. Inouye S. Reverse transcriptase with concomitant ribonuclease H activity in the cell-free synthesis of branched RNA-linked msDNA of Myxococcus xanthus.Cell. 1989; 56: 701-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A portion of the ncRNA serves as a template for reverse transcription, which terminates at a defined position within the ncRNA (Lampson et al., 1989Lampson B.C. Inouye M. Inouye S. Reverse transcriptase with concomitant ribonuclease H activity in the cell-free synthesis of branched RNA-linked msDNA of Myxococcus xanthus.Cell. 1989; 56: 701-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). During reverse transcription, cellular RNase H degrades the segment of the ncRNA that serves as template, but not other parts of the ncRNA, yielding the mature RNA-DNA hybrid (Lampson et al., 1989Lampson B.C. Inouye M. Inouye S.

Dozens of retrons have been documented in a variety of microbial genomes, and 16 of them were studied experimentally in detail (Simon et al., 2019Simon A.J. Ellington A.D. Finkelstein I.J. Retrons and their applications in genome engineering.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: 11007-11019Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The documented retrons were all named following a naming convention that includes the first letters of their genus and species names, as well as the length of reverse-transcribed DNA (e.g., Ec48 is a retron found in Escherichia coli whose reverse transcribed DNA segment is 48 nt long). All studied retrons contain an RT and a ncRNA, with the conserved guanosine from which reverse transcription is initiated (Lampson et al., 2001Lampson B. Inouye M. Inouye S. The msDNAs of bacteria.Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 67: 65-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the sequences and lengths of the reverse transcribed template significantly vary and frequently show no sequence similarity between retrons (Das et al., 2011Das R. Shimamoto T. Hosen S.M.Z.

The ability of retrons to produce ssDNA in situ has been adapted for multiple applications of synthetic biology and genome engineering (Farzadfard and Lu, 2014Farzadfard F. Lu T.K. Synthetic biology.

Although retrons have been studied for over 35 years, their biological function remained unknown. It has been suggested that retrons are a form of selfish genetic elements (Rice and Lampson, 1995Rice S.A. Lampson B.C. Bacterial reverse transcriptase and msDNA.Virus Genes. 1995; 11: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or have a function in coping with starvation (Herzer, 1996Herzer P.J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4438-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pathogenesis (Elfenbein et al., 2015Elfenbein J.R. Knodler L.A. Nakayasu E.S. Ansong C. Brewer H.M. Bogomolnaya L. Adams L.G.

However, evidence for these functions was circumstantial, and the mechanism by which retrons would exert these putative functions was not identified. In the current study, we show that retrons form a functional component in a large family of anti-phage defense systems that are widespread in bacteria and confer resistance against a broad range of phages. We initiated the current study by searching for RT genes that may participate in defense against phages. This search was inspired by prior reports on the involvement of RTs in bacterial defense (Fortier et al., 2005Fortier L.-C. Bouchard J.D. Moineau S.

Because bacterial defense systems tend to cluster in “defense islands” in microbial genomes (Cohen et al., 2019Cohen D. Melamed S. Millman A. Shulman G. Oppenheimer-Shaanan Y. Kacen A. Doron S.

Snir S. Koonin E.V. Defense islands in bacterial and archaeal genomes and prediction of novel defense systems.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 6039-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we focused on RT genes of unknown function that are frequently encoded near known anti-phage systems such as restriction enzymes (STAR Methods). One of these RT genes is presented in Figures 1A and 1B . Homologs of this gene appear in a diverse set of bacteria (102 homologs found in species belonging to the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phyla) and show marked tendency to co-localize with known defense systems, with 60 (59%) located near known anti-phage operons (Figures 1A and 1B). The RT gene is always found next to a second gene with a predicted OLD-family endonuclease domain (Schiltz et al., 2020Schiltz C.J. Adams M.C. Chappie J.S. The full-length structure of Thermus scotoductus OLD defines the ATP hydrolysis properties and catalytic mechanism of Class 1 OLD family nucleases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 2762-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and we therefore hypothesized that the RT together with the endonuclease form a two-gene phage resistance system. To test this hypothesis, we cloned this two-gene system from E. coli 200499, together with its flanking intergenic regions, into the laboratory strain E. coli MG1655, which naturally lacks the system. We then challenged the transformed strain with a set of 12 coliphages and found that the system conferred protection against phages from a variety of families: T7 (Podoviridae), T4 and T6 (Myoviridae), and SECphi4, SECphi6, and SECphi18 (Siphoviridae) (Figures 1C and S2).Figure S2Efficiency of Plating of Phages Infecting E. coli with and without the Endonuclease-RT Defense System, Related to Figure 1.Show full captionThe system was cloned from E. coli strain 200499, together with its flanking intergenic regions, into the laboratory strain E. coli MG1655 (Methods).

Data represent plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml; bar graph represents an average of three replicates, with individual data points overlaid. The presence of an atypically large (>100 nt), conserved intergenic region between the predicted endonuclease and RT genes led us to hypothesize that this intergenic region might contain a non-coding RNA (Figure 1B). Indeed, examining RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from Paenibacillus polymyxa (Voichek et al., 2020Voichek M. Maaß S. Kroniger T. Becher D. Sorek R. Peptide-based quorum sensing systems in Paenibacillus polymyxa.Life Sci. Alliance. 2020; 3: e202000847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which naturally encodes this system, showed high levels of expression from the intergenic region (Figure 1D). Similar expression patterns were observed in RNA-seq data from the E. coli strain into which we cloned the defense system, consistent with the presence of a ncRNA in the intergenic region (Figure 1D). Because the RT gene showed significant homology to retron-type RTs (Simon and Zimmerly, 2008Simon D.M. Zimmerly S. A diversity of uncharacterized reverse transcriptases in bacteria.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the newly discovered defense system contains a retron, and the ncRNA we detected is the retron ncRNA precursor. In support of this, we found that the predicted secondary structure of the ncRNA conforms with the characteristics of known retron ncRNA precursors, including the conserved local dsRNA structure immediately followed by non-paired guanosine residues on both strands (Figures 1E and S1). These structural features were conserved among homologs of this system (Figure 1E). To check if the ncRNA indeed forms a precursor for ssDNA synthesis, we extracted the DNA from a strain into which we cloned the RT and ncRNA, and found a ssDNA species sized between 70–80 nt, which was absent from the control strain that contained a GFP gene instead (Figure 1F). These results confirm that the new defense system we discovered contains a previously unidentified retron. To examine whether the retron features are involved in the anti-phage activity of the new defense system, we experimented with mutated versions of the system. Point mutations in the conserved YADD motif of the catalytic core of the RT (D200A and D201A) (Lampson et al., 2005Lampson B.C. Inouye M. Inouye S. Retrons, msDNA, and the bacterial genome.Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2005; 110: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) rendered the system inactive (Figure 1G). Similarly, a point mutation in the ncRNA, mutating the guanosine predicted as the branching residue priming the reverse transcription (Hsu et al., 1992Hsu M.Y. Eagle S.G. Inouye M. Inouye S. Cell-free synthesis of the branched RNA-linked msDNA from retron-Ec67 of Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13823-13829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (G > C at position 17 of the ncRNA), or the second conserved guanosine that was shown in other retrons to be essential for initiation of reverse transcription (Hsu et al., 1992Hsu M.Y. Eagle S.G. Inouye M. Inouye S. Cell-free synthesis of the branched RNA-linked msDNA from retron-Ec67 of Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13823-13829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (G > A at position 147), completely abolished defense against phages (Figure 1G). These results suggest that proper reverse transcription of the retron ncRNA is essential for its defensive function. We also found that a point mutation in the ATP-binding motif of the associated predicted OLD-family endonuclease gene (K36A) completely eliminated the defense phenotype, showing that the predicted endonuclease gene is an indispensable component of the retron-containing defense system. We therefore conclude that the new defense system consists of three components essential for its anti-phage activity: the RT and ncRNA (that together form an active retron) and an additional gene that contains a predicted endonuclease domain. Following a recently proposed revised nomenclature for retrons (Simon et al., 2019Simon A.J. Ellington A.D. Finkelstein I.J. Retrons and their applications in genome engineering.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: 11007-11019Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we termed this defense system Retron-Eco8. The identification of a novel defense system that contains a retron led us to ask whether retrons in general may have a role in defense against phages. If this is the case, we would expect to find retrons enriched in defense islands, near known anti-phage defense systems. To test this hypothesis, we searched for homologs of the RT proteins of previously characterized retrons in a set of 38,167 bacterial and archaeal genomes (STAR Methods). We detected 4,802 homologs of retron RTs in 4,446 of the genomes and used hierarchical clustering to divide these homologs into eight clades (Figure 2A; Table S1). We found that in six of the clades, the RT genes had a strong tendency to be genomically associated with other known defense genes in defense islands (STAR Methods). Between 38% and 47% of the genes in each of these clades were found to be located near known defense systems, implying that most retrons may participate in anti-phage defense. Retrons have been previously described as two-component systems comprised of the RT and the precursor ncRNA (Simon et al., 2019Simon A.J. Ellington A.D. Finkelstein I.J. Retrons and their applications in genome engineering.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: 11007-11019Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, when examining the genomic environments of known retrons and their homologs, we observed that the vast majority are encoded as part of a gene cassette that includes one or two additional protein-coding genes (Figures 2B–2D; Table S1). For example, retrons Ec73, St85, and Vc81 (found in E. coli, Salmonella enterica, and Vibrio cholerae, respectively) all have an upstream gene containing a ribosyltransferase and a DNA-binding domain (Figure 2B); and retron Ec48 and its homologs are linked to a gene encoding a protein with two predicted transmembrane (2TM) helices (Figure 2C). Some retrons, including Ec78, Yf79, and Vc95 are encoded as part of a cassette that includes two additional genes: one with an ATPase domain and another with an HNH endonuclease domain, a gene organization that was previously identified in the anti-phage system Septu (Doron et al., 2018Doron S. Melamed S. Ofir G. Leavitt A. Lopatina A. Keren M. Amitai G. Sorek R. Systematic discovery of antiphage defense systems in the microbial pangenome.Science. 2018; 359: eaar4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar; Figure 2D). In other cases (e.g., retron Ec67), the associated gene is fused to the RT gene (Figure 2E). The tight genetic linkage of retrons with these genes suggests that the functional unit that includes the retrons also includes the associated genes. We refer to these associated genes as retron “effectors,” due to reasons explained below. Overall, we found 10 different types of such effector genes that are associated with the retron RTs (Figure 2E). To test whether retrons function as anti-phage defense systems, we experimentally examined six previously characterized retrons that were identified in E. coli strains, as well as five validated retrons encoded by S. enterica and V. cholerae. We cloned each retron, together with the predicted effector gene(s), into an E. coli MG1655 strain that is not known to encode retrons. We then challenged the retron-containing bacteria with an array of 12 phages that span several major phage families. For eight of the 11 systems, we observed marked anti-phage activity against at least one phage (Figures 3 and S3). For some strains (e.g., those harboring retrons Ec86 and Se72), anti-phage activity was restricted to one phage, while for others (Ec73 and Ec48) defense was broad, spanning phages from several different phage families (Figures 3 and S3).Figure S3Efficiency of Plating of Phages Infecting Retron Containing Strains, Related to Figure 3Show full captionThe efficiency of plating is shown for 12 phages infecting E. coli MG1655 strains cloned with retron defense systems, or with a plasmid encoding RFP as negative control.

Data represent plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml; bar graph represents an average of three replicates, with individual data points overlaid. To assess whether both the activity of the retron and its effector gene are necessary for anti-phage defense, we further experimented with the two retron systems that showed the broadest defense (Ec48 and Ec73). Point mutations predicted to inactivate the catalytic site of the RT (D216A/D217A in the RT of Ec48 and D189A/D190A in the RT of Ec73) completely abolished defense, indicating that reverse transcription of the retron is essential for defense. In addition, an E117Q point mutation predicted to inactivate the catalytic site of the ribosyltransferase domain of the Ec73 effector (Sikowitz et al., 2013Sikowitz M.D. Cooper L.E. Begley T.P. Kaminski P.A. Ealick S.E. Reversal of the substrate specificity of CMP N-glycosidase to dCMP.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 4037-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), led to a non-functional system, and similarly, deletion of the transmembrane helices of the gene associated with the Ec48 retron also abolished defense (Figures 3 and S3). Together, these results show that retrons, functioning together with their associated effector genes, form anti-phage defense systems. To assess the prevalence of retron defense systems in prokaryotes, we examined their distribution in the set of 38,167 bacterial and archaeal genomes that we analyzed, which belong to 14,566 species. Homologs of the retron RT were found in 1,928 species, belonging to over 20 different phyla. Retrons homologs were common in Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, and in these phyla, more than 20% of the species were found to encode retrons (Figure S4A). In contrast, retron homologs were rare in Archaea, with only 4 out of 347 species (1%) of the Euryarchaeota phylum harboring retrons (Figure S4A; Table S1). The most common retron effector type was a ribosyltransferase effector, appearing next to 1,525 (32%) of the retron RT homologs we found (Figures 2E and S4B). Retrons with this effector type are present in bacteria spanning a wide phylogenetic diversity, but other types of retrons appear only in a narrow range of bacteria. For example, retrons with predicted cold-shock protein, transmembrane domains (2TM), and ATPase + HNH nuclease effectors are only found in Proteobacteria (Figure S4B). Some of the retron effector genes include protein domains that are also found in effector proteins of CBASS anti-phage defense systems, which cause the cell to commit suicide once phage infection has been sensed (Cohen et al., 2019Cohen D. Melamed S. Millman A. Shulman G. Oppenheimer-Shaanan Y. Kacen A. Doron S. Amitai G. Sorek R. Cyclic GMP-AMP signalling protects bacteria against viral infection.Nature. 2019; 574: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In CBASS, effector proteins that encode transmembrane, endonuclease, and TIR domains are responsible for the cell-killing effect after receiving a signal indicative of phage infection, causing the metabolism of the infected bacteria to arrest before the phage is able to complete its replication cycle, a defense strategy that is generally referred to as abortive infection (Bernheim and Sorek, 2020Bernheim A. Sorek R. The pan-immune system of bacteria: antiviral defence as a community resource.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar; Lopatina et al., 2020Lopatina A. Tal N. Sorek R. Abortive Infection: Bacterial Suicide as an Antiviral Immune Strategy.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2020; 7: 371-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This has led us to hypothesize that retrons also function via abortive infection, and the retron effector genes may be responsible for the toxic effect in response to phage infection. In support of this hypothesis, a recent study by Bobonis et al., 2020aBobonis J. Mateus A. Pfalz B. Garcia-Santamarina S. Galardini M. Kobayashi C. Stein F. Savitski M.M. Elfenbein J.R. Andrews-Poymenis H. et al.Bacterial retrons encode tripartite toxin/antitoxin systems.bioRxiv. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.22.160168Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar showed that in the Salmonella retron St85 the associated effector protein is a toxin, which is inhibited by the activity of the retron RT and msDNA. If retrons function via abortive infection, it is predicted that infection with a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) (in which nearly all bacteria are infected in the first cycle) would cause cell death or growth arrest in all infected bacteria, even for cells that contain the defense system. To test this hypothesis, we infected retron-containing bacteria with varying MOIs and examined the infection dynamics in liquid culture (Figure 4A). At an MOI of 0.02, cell cultures that do not contain the defense system eventually collapsed due to phage propagation and eventual lysis, whereas retron-containing cultures did not collapse. However, at an MOI of 2, all retron-containing cultures either collapsed (Eco8) or entered a state of growth stasis. These results suggest that retrons, in general, protect against phages via an abortive infection defense strategy. To gain further insight into the abortive infection process, we focused on retron Ec48, as it provided strong defense against phages belonging to three different families (Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae) (Figure 3). The Ec48 retron defense system contains an effector gene with two transmembrane-spanning helices (Figure 2C). Such a transmembrane-spanning domain organization is common in effector proteins of CBASS systems, in which it is predicted to impair the membrane integrity, causing the infected bacteria to die before the phage is able to complete its replication cycle (Cohen et al., 2019Cohen D. Melamed S. Millman A. Shulman G. Oppenheimer-Shaanan Y. Kacen A. Doron S. Amitai G. Sorek R. Cyclic GMP-AMP signalling protects bacteria against viral infection.Nature. 2019; 574: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that in the process of the abortive infection inflicted by the Ec48 retron defense system, the transmembrane-spanning effector also exerts its toxicity by causing the cell membrane of infected cells to become permeable. To assess this possibility, we examined Ec48-containing cells under the microscope during infection with the λ-vir phage. Cells were stained with a membrane dye and with propidium iodide (PI), a fluorescent DNA-binding agent that penetrates cells only if they lost plasma membrane integrity, thus marking cells with impaired membranes (Figure 4B). Cells harboring a mutated, inactive Ec48 system, where the two predicted transmembrane helices were deleted in the effector gene, were not protected against the phage and exhibited phage-mediated cell lysis 45 min after initial infection. However, cells containing an intact Ec48 retron system became stained with PI already 15 min post"
https://openalex.org/W3096800861,"Cellular functioning requires the orchestration of thousands of molecular interactions in time and space. Yet most molecules in a cell move by diffusion, which is sensitive to external factors like temperature. How cells sustain complex, diffusion-based systems across wide temperature ranges is unknown. Here, we uncover a mechanism by which budding yeast modulate viscosity in response to temperature and energy availability. This ""viscoadaptation"" uses regulated synthesis of glycogen and trehalose to vary the viscosity of the cytosol. Viscoadaptation functions as a stress response and a homeostatic mechanism, allowing cells to maintain invariant diffusion across a 20°C temperature range. Perturbations to viscoadaptation affect solubility and phase separation, suggesting that viscoadaptation may have implications for multiple biophysical processes in the cell. Conditions that lower ATP trigger viscoadaptation, linking energy availability to rate regulation of diffusion-controlled processes. Viscoadaptation reveals viscosity to be a tunable property for regulating diffusion-controlled processes in a changing environment."
https://openalex.org/W3094964773,"Neurons are known to rely on autophagy for removal of defective proteins or organelles to maintain synaptic neurotransmission and counteract neurodegeneration. In spite of its importance for neuronal health, the physiological substrates of neuronal autophagy in the absence of proteotoxic challenge have remained largely elusive. We use knockout mice conditionally lacking the essential autophagy protein ATG5 and quantitative proteomics to demonstrate that loss of neuronal autophagy causes selective accumulation of tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in axons, resulting in increased excitatory neurotransmission and compromised postnatal viability in vivo. The gain in excitatory neurotransmission is shown to be a consequence of elevated calcium release from ER stores via ryanodine receptors accumulated in axons and at presynaptic sites. We propose a model where neuronal autophagy controls axonal ER calcium stores to regulate neurotransmission in healthy neurons and in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3096124115,"Background COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic, for which appropriate infection prevention and control measures need to be adopted. Healthcare workers’ adherence to prevention and control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we assessed the KAP among healthcare workers towards the COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. Method A self-developed piloted KAP questionnaire was administered to the recruited healthcare workers involved in the COVID-19 response at the Universal College of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital (UCMSTH), in Bhairahawa, Nepal. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of questions regarding the clinical characteristics, prevention, and management of COVID-19. Assessment on attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on behaviour and change in practices made towards COVID-19 response. Knowledge scores were calculated and compared by demographic characteristics and their attitude and practices towards COVID-19. Data were analysed using bivariate statistics. Results A total of 103 healthcare workers participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 28.24±6.11 years (range: 20–56); 60.2% were females; 61.2% were unmarried; 60.2% had a medical degree, and 39.8% were the nursing staff. The mean knowledge score was 10.59±1.12 (range: 7–13), and it did not vary significantly when adjusted for demographic characteristics. The attitude was positive for 53.4% of the participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.35±1.19 and negative for 46.6% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.88±0.98 (p = 0.02). The practice was good (≥3 score) for 81.5% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.73±1.12 and poor for 18.5% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.46±1.13 (p = 0.24). The attitude of the participants improved with increasing age (29.55±7.17, p = 0.02). Conclusion There is comparably better knowledge regarding COVID-19 among healthcare workers. Appropriate practice correlates with better knowledge and positive attitude towards COVID-19 infection is seen with increasing age. Hence, training on protection and protective measures for having a positive attitude among healthcare workers is necessary against the fight with COVID-19 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3096978385,"Development of drug resistance in opportunistic pathogens is one of the major healthcare challenges associated with infection management. Combination therapy has many advantages due to the simultaneous action of two drugs on two separate cellular targets. However, selection of the drugs should offer safety and synergistic interaction against most of the strains. Here, the efficacy of antibiotics in combination with quercetin, a natural flavonoid capable of targeting quorum sensing was tested against biofilm-forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains previously isolated from catheter associated urinary tract infection. Based on the antibiotic susceptibility pattern, synergistic effect of quercetin with selected antibiotics (levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, gentamycin, tobramycin and amikacin) was tested at the fractional concentrations of MIC by the checkerboard method and the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FIC i ) was calculated to estimate the synergistic effect. Effect of the synergistic combinations were further tested using time-kill assay, and against biofilm formation and biofilm cell viability. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using Human Embryonic Kidney 293T cells (HEK-293T) using the effective drug combinations with respective controls. The biofilm formation and biofilm cell viability were drastically affected with quercetin and selected antibiotics combinations with ≥80% inhibition. In vitro infection studies showed that all the strains could exert significant cell killing (68 to 85%) and the drug combinations decreased the infection rate significantly by reducing the cell killing effect of P . aeruginosa (p&lt;0.05). The synergistic effect of quercetin is attributed to its quorum sensing inhibitory properties. These findings indicate that quercetin along with existing antibiotics can potentiate the treatment against P . aeruginosa infection and may reduce the selection pressure due to antibiotic overuse."
https://openalex.org/W3096879739,"Extracellular vesicles (EV) have attracted much attention as potential biomarkers due to their protein, RNA and other nucleic acid content. The most common method used for EV isolation is differential ultracentrifugation (DU), however given the DU technical difficulties, other more practical methods have surged, such as membrane-affinity column commercial kits. Here, we assessed one commercial kit in terms of EV recovery and EV-derived RNA yield and compared it with a DU protocol. Our data shows that the commercial kit preparation results in a lower count of EV-like structures and a reduced expression of EV markers when compared to DU samples. Thus, apparently suggesting that the commercial kit had a lower EV yield. However, these findings did not reflect on RNA yield, which was greater with the commercial kit, even after an enzymatic treatment with proteinase K and RNAse A. We conclude that the kit has a higher EV-derived RNA yield in comparison to our DU protocol, suggesting that it may be the method of choice for RNA sequencing purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3094725717,"The largest and most dynamic agricultural frontier in Brazil is known as MATOPIBA, an area that covers part of the Cerrado biome. Within this region, Western Bahia stands out as a large producer of soy and cotton. There are no studies that quantify carbon stocks for different land uses and land cover types in Western Bahia, which hinders comprehension of the role of agricultural expansion in carbon dynamics and the development of sustainable agriculture policies. Here, we evaluate how the land use changes in this region have affected the carbon balance in the aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and soil reservoirs. We collected soil samples for areas with different land uses and land cover types to estimate soil carbon stocks (SCS) and combined remote sensing results and modeling techniques to develop a historical reconstruction of spatial patterns of SCS, AGB, and BGB during the period 1990–2018. The replacement of areas from the forest formations class with pasture and rainfed agriculture reduced the 100 cm depth SCS (SCS 100 ) by 37.3% ( p = 0.031) and 30.3% (p = 0.053), respectively. By contrast, the conversion of pasture and rainfed agriculture to irrigated agriculture increased SCS 100 by 34% ( p = 0.034) and 26.5% ( p = 0.022), respectively. Spatial changes in historical carbon stocks are strongly associated with land use changes that occurred between 1990 and 2018. We estimated a non-significant loss of 61.9 Tg-C ( p = 0.726) from the total carbon stocks (calculated as the sum of AGB, BGB, and SCS) of which 80% of the losses came from soil stocks, 11% from BGB, and 8% from AGB. These findings reveal the need to monitor carbon stocks in sandy soils to reduce the uncertainties of estimates and support the development of effective sustainable agriculture policies. The best alternatives for reducing carbon losses in the Cerrado are to maintain natural forest cover and to recover soils through sustainable soil management, especially in pasturelands where soil carbon stocks are lowest."
https://openalex.org/W3094635613,"Buprenorphine is a μ-opioid receptor (MOR) partial agonist used to manage pain and addiction. QT C prolongation that crosses the 10 msec threshold of regulatory concern was observed at a supratherapeutic dose in two thorough QT studies for the transdermal buprenorphine product BUTRANS ® . Because QT C prolongation can be associated with Torsades de Pointes (TdP), a rare but potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia, these results have led to further investigation of the electrophysiological effects of buprenorphine. Drug-induced QT C prolongation and TdP are most commonly caused by acute inhibition of hERG current (I hERG ) that contribute to the repolarizing phase of the ventricular action potentials (APs). Concomitant inhibition of inward late Na + (I NaL ) and/or L-type Ca 2+ (I CaL ) current can offer some protection against proarrhythmia. Therefore, we characterized the effects of buprenorphine and its major metabolite norbuprenorphine on cardiac hERG, Ca 2+ , and Na + ion channels, as well as cardiac APs. For comparison, methadone, a MOR agonist associated with QT C prolongation and high TdP risk, and naltrexone and naloxone, two opioid receptor antagonists, were also studied. Whole cell recordings were performed at 37°C on cells stably expressing hERG, Ca V 1.2, and Na V 1.5 proteins. Microelectrode array (MEA) recordings were made on human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). The results showed that buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, naltrexone, and naloxone had no effect on I hERG , I CaL , I NaL , and peak Na + current (I NaP ) at clinically relevant concentrations. In contrast, methadone inhibited I hERG , I CaL , and I NaL . Experiments on iPSC-CMs showed a lack of effect for buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, naltrexone, and naloxone, and delayed repolarization for methadone at clinically relevant concentrations. The mechanism of QT C prolongation is opioid moiety-specific. This remains undefined for buprenorphine, while for methadone it involves direct hERG channel block. There is no evidence that buprenorphine use is associated with TdP. Whether this lack of TdP risk can be generalized to other drugs with QT C prolongation not mediated by acute hERG channel block warrants further study."
https://openalex.org/W3095910038,"Background The rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (IA) causes devastating subarachnoid hemorrhages, yet most IAs remain undiscovered until they rupture. Recently, we found an IA RNA expression signature of circulating neutrophils, and used transcriptome data to build predictive models for unruptured IAs. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of using whole blood transcriptomes to predict the presence of unruptured IAs. Methods We subjected RNA from peripheral whole blood of 67 patients (34 with unruptured IA, 33 without IA) to next-generation RNA sequencing. Model genes were identified using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in a random training cohort (n = 47). These genes were used to train a Gaussian Support Vector Machine (gSVM) model to distinguish patients with IA. The model was applied to an independent testing cohort (n = 20) to evaluate performance by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Gene ontology and pathway analyses investigated the underlying biology of the model genes. Results We identified 18 genes that could distinguish IA patients in a training cohort with 85% accuracy. This SVM model also had 85% accuracy in the testing cohort, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.91. Bioinformatics reflected activation and recruitment of leukocytes, activation of macrophages, and inflammatory response, suggesting that the biomarker captures important processes in IA pathogenesis. Conclusions Circulating whole blood transcriptomes can detect the presence of unruptured IAs. Pending additional testing in larger cohorts, this could serve as a foundation to develop a simple blood-based test to facilitate screening and early detection of IAs."
https://openalex.org/W3097807172,"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is a fat-soluble antioxidant. Although CoQ10 has not been approved as medication by the Food and Drug Administration, it is widely used in dietary supplements. Some studies have shown that CoQ10 has anti-inflammatory effects on various autoimmune disorders. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of liposome/gold hybrid nanoparticles encoded with CoQ10 (LGNP-CoQ10). Both CoQ10 and LGNP-CoQ10 were administered orally to mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) for 10 weeks. The inflammation pathology of joint tissues of CIA mice was then analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin and Safranin O staining, as well as immunohistochemistry analysis. We obtained immunofluorescence staining images of spleen tissues using confocal microscopy. We found that pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased in LGNP-CoQ10 injected mice. Th17 cell and phosphorylated STAT3-expressed cell populations were also decreased in LGNP-CoQ10 injected mice. When human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were treated with CoQ10 and LGNP-CoQ10, the IL-17 expression of PBMCs in the LGNP-CoQ10-treated group was significantly reduced. Together, these results suggest that LGNP-CoQ10 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3097567327,"Ensuring good health and welfare is an increasingly important consideration for conservation of endangered species and includes breeding of individuals managed under human care. Understanding how factors in the captive environment affect individual animal wellbeing can be aided by long-term monitoring of biological functioning. This study involved longitudinal assessments (4 to 28 years) of reproductive and adrenal hormones in zoo-housed female Asian elephants ( Elephas maximus ) (age range 4 to ~71 years) to elucidate patterns in adrenal glucocorticoid (GC) activity in association with reproductive and demographic factors, and examine individual response to major social changes. Concentrations of serum and urinary cortisol covaried more consistently with physiological changes (ovarian cycle phase, puberty, pregnancy, lactational anestrus, and age) than with social life events (births, deaths, and facility transfers). Cortisol fluctuated across the ovarian cycle with mean concentrations being higher in the follicular than in the luteal phase, and concentrations were highest in lactational anestrous compared to all other reproductive states. The elephants in this study exhibited substantial individuality in adrenal GC response to major social change, reinforcing the need to assess welfare on an individual basis and to consider factors influencing the impact of perceived stressors, such as social relationships, social support, temperament, and life history. Outcomes from this study deepen our understanding of Asian elephant physiology and highlight the importance of taking intrinsic patterns of hormone secretion into account when evaluating the impact of external factors. Finally, a better understanding of the impact of social change and resiliency in response to real and perceived stressors allows us to improve social management to enhance welfare in both captive settings and free-ranging environments."

This is especially so when the quality of the water source is not reliable. We present a hierarchical Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model supported by statistical analysis to explore the influence of household’s socio-economic characteristics (SECs) on the HWT behavior via household’s psychological factors. The model uses eight SECs, such as mother’s and father’s education, wealth, and religion, and five RANAS psychological factors, i.e., risk, attitude, norms, ability, and self-regulation to analyse HWT behavior in a suburban area in Palu, Indonesia. Structured household interviews were conducted among 202 households. We found that mother’s education is the most important SEC that influences the regular use of HWT. An educated mother has more positive attitude towards HWT and is more confident in her ability to perform HWT. Moreover, self-regulation, especially the attempt to deal with any barrier that hinders HWT practice, is the most important psychological factor that can change irregular HWT users to regular HWT users. Hence, this paper recommends to HWT-program implementers to identify potential barriers and discuss potential solutions with the target group in order to increase the probability of the target group being a regular HWT user."

Active and inactive extracts were analyzed by UHPLC-MS and data evaluated using a metabolomics platform, revealing an unknown neoflavonoid (connarin, 3 ), isolated together with the pterocarpans: hemileiocarpin ( 1 ) and leiocarpin ( 2 ). The aforementioned compounds ( 1 – 3 ), together with the benzoquinones: rapanone ( 4 ), embelin ( 5 ) and suberonone ( 6 ) previously isolated by our group from the same species, were tested against: (i) L . amazonensis and L . infantum promastigotes, and (ii) L . amazonensis intracellular amastigotes, with the most active compound ( 3 ) also tested against L . infantum amastigotes. Cytotoxicity against murine peritoneal macrophages was also investigated. Compounds 2 and 3 presented an IC 50 33.8 μM and 11.4 μM for L . amazonensis promastigotes; and 44.3 μM and 13.3 μM for L . infantum promastigotes, respectively. For L . amazonensis amastigotes, the IC 50 of 2 was 20.4 μM with a selectivity index (SI) of 5.7, while the IC 50 of 3 was 2.9 μM with an SI of 6.3. For L . infantum amastigotes, the IC 50 of 3 was 7.7 μM. Compounds 2 and 3 presented activity comparable with the miltefosine positive control, with compound 3 found to be 2–4 times more active than the positive control, depending on the Leishmania species and form. The extracts and isolated compounds showed moderate toxicity against macrophages. Compounds 2 and 3 altered the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and neutral lipid body accumulation, while 2 also impacted plasma membrane permeabilization, culminating in cellular disorder and parasite death. Transmission electron microscopy of L . amazonensis promastigotes treated with compound 3 confirmed the presence of lipid bodies. Leiocarpin ( 2 ) and connarin ( 3 ) demonstrated antileishmanial activity. This study provides knowledge of natural products with antileishmanial activity, paving the way for prototype development to fight this neglected tropical disease."

Metagenomic data-mining reveals contrasting microbial populations responsible for trimethylamine formation in human gut and marine ecosystems.Microb. Genom. 2016; 2e000080PubMed Google Scholar). CntA belongs to a large group of non-heme-iron–containing Rieske oxygenase family (13Zhu Y. Jameson E. Crosatti M. Schafer H. Rajakumar K. Bugg T.D. Chen Y. Carnitine metabolism to trimethylamine by an unusual rieske-type oxygenase from human microbiota.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 4268-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Rieske oxygenases are typically multicomponent enzyme systems involving an oxygenase, a reductase, and sometimes a separate flavin cofactor (22Wackett L.P. Mechanism and applications of Rieske non-heme iron dioxygenases.Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 31: 577-587Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The oxygenase component has a conserved [2Fe-2S] Rieske center coordinated by two cysteine and two histidine residues and a catalytic mononuclear iron (Fe) center (23Barry S.M. Challis G.L. Mechanism and catalytic diversity of rieske non-heme iron-dependent oxygenases.ACS Catal. 2013; 3: 2362-2370Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Bugg T.D. Ramaswamy S. Non-heme iron-dependent dioxygenases: unravelling catalytic mechanisms for complex enzymatic oxidations.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A reductase component reduces pyridine nucleotides, generating electrons, which are ultimately transferred to the Rieske oxygenase for substrate oxidation. The archetypal Rieske oxygenases, also known as ring-hydroxylating Rieske oxygenases, catalyze the oxidation of a range of aromatic and polyaromatic substrates; as such, they are important in bioremediation of environmental pollutants (24Bugg T.D.

Structural determination of several ring-hydroxylating Rieske oxygenases (e.g., naphthalene dioxygenase and biphenyl dioxygenase) reveals that the Rieske center and the catalytic mononuclear Fe center are usually far apart in the same subunit (>40 Å) and effective electron transfer can only occur across the interface of two neighboring subunits (23Barry S.M.

It is becoming increasingly clear that quaternary amines-oxidizing Rieske oxygenases represent a new emerging clade of the Rieske oxygenases family that is distinct from the archetypal ring-hydroxylating aromatic Rieske oxygenases (13Zhu Y.

The carnitine-degrading CntA enzyme is a promising new drug target, given that gut microbial metabolism of carnitine is known to increase plasma TMAO, leading to the subsequent development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (9Brown J.M. Hazen S.L. Microbial modulation of cardiovascular disease.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, no structure of CntA or description of possible inhibitors has been published. In this study, we report high-resolution crystal structures of CntA with and without substrates bound and report the first known inhibitors for this enzyme and the crystal structure of an inhibitor-bound CntA. Structure, biochemical, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterization of CntA and mutants provides novel insights into the mode of inhibition and the inter-/intrasubunit electron transfer in carnitine oxidation. Our work therefore provides the structural and molecular basis for future discovery of drugs targeting this TMA-producing enzyme in human gut. We set out to solve the structure of CntA from Acinetobacter baumannii and successfully obtained structures of CntA in the apo protein form (2.1 Å, PDB 6Y8J) and ligand-bound forms with two substrates, carnitine (2.0 Å, PDB 6Y9D) and γ-butyrobetaine (gBB; 1.6 Å, PDB 6Y8S) (Table 1). We observed a head-to-tail α3 trimeric structure for CntA (Fig. 1B), with the Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster and mononuclear Fe center at opposing regions of the monomer 44 Å apart (Fig. 1C). The observed assembly of α3 homotrimer is in agreement with the analyses by native protein gel (13Zhu Y. Jameson E. Crosatti M. Schafer H. Rajakumar K. Bugg T.D. Chen Y.

Biol. 2009; 392: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2B). The active sites containing mononuclear Fe centers are, however, considerably varied in enzymes of the Rieske oxygenase family (Fig. S2B), reflecting the diverse catalytic reactions catalyzed by these enzymes. The mononuclear Fe exists in an octahedral geometry and is coordinated by two histidine ligands (His213, His208) and a bidentate aspartate residue (Asp 323) in a well-documented His-His-Asp catalytic triad (31Hegg E.L. Que Jr., L. The 2-his-1-carboxylate facial triad — an emerging structural motif in mononuclear non-heme iron(II) enzymes.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), coordinating one face of the Fe center (Fig. 1E). A pair of reduced Cys (Cys206, Cys209) is found near the mononuclear Fe in CntA, whereas in stachydrine demethylase Stc2 the corresponding Cys formed a disulfide bridge (28Daughtry K.D. Xiao Y. Stoner-Ma D. Cho E. Orville A.M. Liu P. Allen K.N. Quaternary ammonium oxidative demethylation: X-ray crystallographic, resonance Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopic analysis of a rieske-type demethylase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; 134: 2823-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A water molecule and a thiocyanate [SCN]- anion occupy the two coordination sites, which are 2.2 and 2.3 Å away from the mononuclear Fe center in CntA, respectively (Fig. 1E, Fig. S2C). Both the water molecule and [SCN]- are positioned 3.7 Å below the Cα adjacent to the carnitine ammonium group, which is expected to be the site of hydroxylation catalyzed by this enzyme (Fig. 1E). SCN- bound at the O2 site likely resulted in the stabilization of CntA cocrystalized with the substrates. The catalytic mononuclear Fe in purified CntA is in a ferrous (Fe2+) state, showing no EPR signals associated with either high-spin (S = 5/2) or low-spin (S = ½) ferric center (Fe3+) despite purifying the protein under aerobic conditions. This is confirmed by the addition of nitric oxide (NO) to CntA, showing an EPR signal from a S = ½ species of the Fe2+-NO adduct (Fig. 1F). This is contrast to the other nonheme oxygenase enzymes, where NO binding to the mononuclear iron center often led to the formation of high-spin, S = 3/2 signal (32Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Lipscomb J.D. Single turnover chemistry and regulation of O2 activation by the oxygenase component of naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This plausibly suggests that the mononuclear iron ion exists as an S = 0 in its ferrous state. The observed EPR signal for the Fe2+-NO adduct is similar to the previously reported heme-/nonheme-NO adducts (33Quaroni L.G. Seward H.E. McLean K.J. Girvan H.M. Ost T. W.B. Noble M.A. Kelly S.M.

Nitric oxide and iron proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 290-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Structural determination of CntA revealed that the two functional domains in CntA (the Rieske domain and the catalytic mononuclear Fe domain) are located 44 Å apart in the same subunit. As such, electron transfer to the catalytic mononuclear Fe center is likely to occur only at the interface of two adjacent CntA subunits (12.2 Å apart) and facilitated by the so-called bridging glutamate (E205, Fig. 2A) (13Zhu Y. Jameson E. Crosatti M. Schafer H. Rajakumar K. Bugg T.D. Chen Y. Carnitine metabolism to trimethylamine by an unusual rieske-type oxygenase from human microbiota.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 4268-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Electron transfer from NADH to the carnitine oxygenase CntA is mediated through a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-containing reductase CntB, which was essential for the enzyme activity (13Zhu Y. Jameson E. Crosatti M. Schafer H. Rajakumar K. Bugg T.D. Chen Y. Carnitine metabolism to trimethylamine by an unusual rieske-type oxygenase from human microbiota.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 4268-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To monitor electron transfer pathway (Fig. 2B) from the reductant NADH via the flavin-containing reductase CntB to the catalytic domain in the oxygenase CntA, continuous wave (cw)-EPR was used. Purified CntB is EPR-silent (Fig. 2C, black trace); however, the reduced ferredoxin center in CntB is readily detectable once NADH is added (red trace). The EPR spectrum of reduced CntB has a characteristic reduced ferredoxin [2Fe-2S]+1 signal [g tensor 2.031, 1.937, 1.899] and a radical signal resulting from flavin semiquinone gave = 2.0015. Similar flavin semiquinone radicals have been observed previously in other Rieske oxygenase reductase as well as monoamine oxidase (35Batie C.J. LaHaie E. Ballou D.P.

Reduced CntB spectrum was simulated by a combination of two different S = ½ spin states (97% for the reduced ferredoxin and 3% for a flavin semiquinone radical) (Table 2), confirming electron transfer from the reductant NADH to the ferredoxin domain in CntB (steps 1–3 in Fig. 2B). The purified CntA (blue trace) showed a very weak anisotropic EPR signal with gave < 2.0 (g tensor 2.011, 1.916, 1.757), indicating that the Rieske center in CntA is predominantly in the oxidized, diferric [2Fe-2S]2+ state (Table 2) (37Lee J. Simurdiak M. Zhao H. Reconstitution and characterization of aminopyrrolnitrin oxygenase, a rieske N-oxygenase that catalyzes unusual arylamine oxidation.J. Biol.

Addition of an oxidizing agent (H2O2) to CntA has minimal effect on the overall spectrum (Fig. S3A); however, the Rieske center in CntA can be readily reduced by dithionite (Fig. S3B). CntA also appears capable of oxidizing the substrate (carnitine) using H2O2 in the absence of CntB/NADH (Fig. S3A), consistent with the peroxide shunt-mechanism known in other Rieske oxygenases (39Wolfe M.D. Lipscomb J.D.

In order to monitor electron flow from CntB to CntA, the spectrum of CntA + NADH + CntB was recorded (magenta trace). This complex spectrum can be simulated by the combination of three different S = ½ spin states (Table 2, Fig. S4). Thus, the addition of CntB + NADH to CntA allowed reduction of the Rieske center in CntA, confirming cross-subunit electron transfer from CntB to CntA (step 4 in Fig. 2B).Table 2Spin-Hamiltonian parameters used to model the EPR spectra shown in Fig. 2CSamplesEPR active signalSpecies%g1g2g3gaveAs-isolated CntA2.01051.91571.75741.8945As-isolated CntBNo EPR active signal detectedCntB+NADH[2Fe-2S]+1specA (reduced ferredoxin domain)932.03141.93721.89881.9558Flavin radicalspecB (Flavin radical)72.00152.00152.00152.0015CntA+CntB+NADH[2Fe-2S]+1 in CntBspecA (reduced ferredoxin domain)612.03131.93761.89791.9556Flavin radicalspecB22.00102.00342.00392.0028[2Fe-2S]+1 in CntAspecC (reduced Rieske center)372.00791.91531.75421.8924CntA+CntB+NADH+Carnitinean organic radicalspecB342.00002.00352.00372.0024[2Fe-2S]+1 in CntAaThis EPR active signal may also contain overlapping EPR signals derived from the catalytic mononuclear iron center; plausible EPR active intermediates are ferric-(hydro)peroxy or a high-valent iron(V)-oxo species.specC662.00711.90771.79861.9045E205A+CntB+NADH+Carnitine[2Fe-2S]+1 in CntBspecA1402.03381.93971.88681.9534[2Fe-2S]+1 in CntBspecA2202.04491.94931.90371.9660Flavin radicalbThis may represent an overlay of both a flavin and an unidentified organic radical.specB82.00122.00402.00402.0031[2Fe-2S]+1 in CntAaThis EPR active signal may also contain overlapping EPR signals derived from the catalytic mononuclear iron center; plausible EPR active intermediates are ferric-(hydro)peroxy or a high-valent iron(V)-oxo species.specC322.00701.90771.78961.9014a This EPR active signal may also contain overlapping EPR signals derived from the catalytic mononuclear iron center; plausible EPR active intermediates are ferric-(hydro)peroxy or a high-valent iron(V)-oxo species.b This may represent an overlay of both a flavin and an unidentified organic radical.

https://openalex.org/W3096445433,"Novel Covid-19 has had a huge impact on the world’s population since December 2019. The very rapid spreading of the virus worldwide, with its heavy toll of death and overload of the healthcare systems, induced the scientific community to focus on understanding, monitoring and foreseeing the epidemic evolution, weighing up the impact of different containment measures. An immense literature was produced in few months. Many papers were focused on predicting the peak features through a variety of different models. In the present paper, combining the surveillance data-set with data on mobility and testing, we develop a deterministic compartment model aimed at performing a retrospective analysis to understand the main modifications occurred to the characteristic parameters that regulate the epidemic spreading. We find that, besides self-protective behaviors, a reduction of susceptibility should have occurred in order to explain the fast descent of the epidemic after the peak. A sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number, in response to variations of the epidemiological parameters that can be influenced by policy-makers, shows the primary importance of a rigid isolation procedure for the diagnosed cases, combined with an intensive effort in performing extended testing campaigns. Future scenarios depend on the ability to protect the population from the injection of new cases from abroad, and to pursue in applying rigid self-protective measures."
https://openalex.org/W3096603090,"The phenotypic changes that occurred during the domestication and diversification of grapevine are well known, particularly changes in seed morphology, but the functional causes and consequences behind these variations are poorly understood. Wild and domesticate grapes differ, among others, in the form of their pips: wild grapes produce roundish pips with short stalks and cultivated varieties have more elongated pips with longer stalks. Such variations of form are of first importance for archaeobotany since the pip form is, most often, the only remaining information in archaeological settings. This study aims to enlighten archaeobotanical record and grapevine pip development by better understanding how size and shape (co)variates between pip and berry in both wild and domesticated Vitis vinifera . The covariation of berry size, number of seeds per berry (“piposity”), pip size and pip shape were explored on 49 grapevine accessions sampled among Euro-Mediterranean traditional cultivars and wild grapevines. We show that for wild grapevine, the higher the piposity, the bigger the berry and the more elongated the pip. For both wild and domesticated grapevine, the longer is the pip, the more it has a “domesticated” shape. Consequences for archaeobotanical studies are tested and discussed, and these covariations allowed the inference of berry dimensions from archaeological pips from a Southern France Roman site.

They catalyze the addition of the N-acetylglucosamine to the N-acetyl-lactosamine repeat as a key step of the chain elongation process. Poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine is involved in the immune system in many ways. Particularly, its long chain has been demonstrated to suppress excessive immune responses. Among the characterized B3GNTs, B3GNT2 is the major poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine synthase, and deletion of its coding gene dramatically reduced the cell surface poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine and led to hypersensitive and hyperresponsive immunocytes. Despite the extensive functional studies, no structural information is available to understand the molecular mechanism of B3GNT2, as well as other B3GNTs. Here we present the structural and kinetic studies of the human B3GNT2. Five crystal structures of B3GNT2 have been determined in the unliganded, donor substrate-bound, acceptor substrate-bound, and product(s)-bound states at resolutions ranging from 1.85 to 2.35 Å. Kinetic study shows that the transglycosylation reaction follows a sequential mechanism. Critical residues involved in recognition of both donor and acceptor substrates as well as catalysis are identified. Mutations of these invariant residues impair B3GNT2 activity in cell assays. Structural comparison with other glycosyltransferases such as mouse Fringe reveals a novel N-terminal helical domain of B3GNTs that may stabilize the catalytic domain and distinguish among different acceptor substrates. β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (B3GNTs) are Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine chains.

Polylactosamine (poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine) is the essential feature of glycolipids and N-linked or O-linked glycans on glycoproteins. It contains multiple repeats of the N-acetyl-lactosamine (Galβ1-4GlcNAc) unit connected via β1-3 linkage and is frequently further decorated with other functional groups such as terminal sialic acids. Polylactosamine is involved in various biological processes including immune responses, through interacting with endogenous lectins or other carbohydrate-binding proteins. The multivalent interactions between the linear or modified polylactosamine and lectins create ordered lectin-saccharide lattices, which are proposed to initiate signal transduction and drive a series of cellular events including proliferation or death (1Brewer C.F.

Biol. 2002; 12: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). For example, the ubiquitously expressed galectin-1, which recognizes a single repeat of N-acetyl-lactosamine (LacNAc)unit and functions as homodimer (2Camby I. Le Mercier M. Lefranc F. Kiss R. Galectin-1: a small protein with major functions.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 137R-157RCrossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), binds T cell surface glycoproteins (CD3, CD7, CD43, and CD45) and induces redistribution of these proteins into segregated membrane microdomains, essential for triggering T cell apoptosis (3Pace K.E.

The sialic acid–containing glycoconjugates could be recognized by Siglecs and contribute to inhibiting immune cells, maintaining immunological tolerance, modulating immune cell function, and regulating immune cell activation, maturation, and apoptosis (4Pillai S.

The length of polylactosamine chain also affects immune reactions, and the long-chain polylactosamine on N-glycan is suggested to suppress excessive responses (5Togayachi A. Kozono Y. Ishida H.

The elongation of polylactosamine of bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary N-glycans (as well as O-glycans) involves two enzymes, β-1, 4-galactosyltransferase (B4GALT) and β-1, 3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GNT)(8Amado M.

They work in an alternating fashion to add galactose (Gal) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) building blocks to the growing chain via β1-4 and β1-3 linkages (Fig. 1A). Seven B3GNTs (B3GNT2–B3GNT8), which belong to Glycosyl Transferase family 31 in the CAZy database, have so far been identified and functionally characterized in vitro using various oligosaccharide substrates with B3GNT2 demonstrating the strongest polylactosamine synthesizing activity (9Togayachi A.

Supporting the connection of B3GNT2 and the immune system, genome-wide association studies revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms reducing B3GNT2 expression are associated with autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (11Okada Y.

To obtain insights into the molecular mechanism of B3GNTs, we determined the crystal structures of the luminal domain of human B3GNT2 (Fig. 1B) at different stages of its enzymatic reaction: apo (2.35 Å), in complex with the donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc (2.26 Å), in complex with the acceptor substrate LacNAc (2.19 Å), in complex with the product UDP (1.85 Å), and in complex with both products UDP and trisaccharide GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc (2.20 Å), hereinafter referred to as B3GNT2_apo, B3GNT2_UDPGlcNAc, B3GNT2_LacNAc, B3GNT2_UDP, and B3GNT2_tri_UDP, respectively. We also demonstrated that B3GNT2 transglycosylation reaction proceeded through a sequential mechanism with kinetic analysis. Key residues in the catalytic domain essential for binding donor and acceptor substrates as well as its enzymatic activity were identified and further characterized by functional analysis of structure-based mutants. A novel helical domain N-terminal to the catalytic domain was observed and hypothesized to be involved in stabilization of the catalytic domain and differentiation of glycan acceptors. The luminal domain structure of B3GNT2 was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using an iodide derivative to a resolution of 2.50 Å. Subsequently, B3GNT2 structures in apo form or in complex with either substrates or products were determined by molecular replacement using the iodide derivative structure as the template. The six structures presented here were solved in different space groups and the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit also varied (Table S1). But a common dimeric complex formed by two molecules related with crystallographic symmetry was observed. The dimer interface is formed between helices α1, α2, α8 and loop β2-α2 from each molecule and buries a surface area of ∼1963 Å2 (Fig. S1A). Dimer formation was also confirmed in analytical size exclusion chromatography, with an estimated molecular weight of ∼84 kDa (Fig. S1, B and C). The recombinant proteins used for crystallization contain residues Ser31–Cys397 or Lys45–Cys397, but only residues Pro55–Cys397 are well defined in the electron density maps, except for a disordered loop between residues Leu77 and Ser88. The luminal domain of B3GNT2 comprises an N-terminal helical domain (Pro55–Cys125) and a C-terminal catalytic domain (Cys138–Cys397) as well as an extended linker (Arg126–Lys137) that connects the helical domain to the catalytic domain (Fig. 1, C and D). The helical domain consists of three helices α1’, α2’, and α3’ and is unique to B3GNT2 as no such domain has been observed for other glycosyltransferases. The catalytic domain adopts a mixed α/β fold commonly observed in glycosyltransferases of the GT-A superfamily (14Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases: families and functional modules.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and is composed of a typical seven-stranded β sheet core (β1, β2, β3, β4, β5, β6, and β7) flanked mainly by α helices (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α6, and α7), a two stranded antiparallel β sheet formed by β4’ and β7’ (15Chang A. Singh S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Thorson J.S. Glycosyltransferase structural biology and its role in the design of catalysts for glycosylation.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2011; 22: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and an additional 12-residue α helix (α8) at the C terminus. The catalytic domain of human B3GNT2 closely resembles that of other glycosyltransferases, particularly mouse Fringe (PDB ID: 2J0B) (16Jinek M. Chen Y.W. Clausen H. Cohen S.M. Conti E. Structural insights into the notch-modifying glycosyltransferase Fringe.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 945-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E), with an RMSD of 2.17 Å for 181 Cα atoms despite 17% sequence identity between them. The main differences between B3GNT2 and Fringe lie in some of the loops. The α1-β2 loop and the β2-α2 loop are longer in B3GNT2 (12 and 12 residues, respectively) than in Fringe (7 and 2 residues, respectively), whereas the α6-α7 loop and the β7’-α8 loop are shorter in B3GNT2 (8 and 3 residues, respectively) than in Fringe (16 and 22 residues, respectively). The β3-α3 loop and the β5-β6 loop are ordered in the B3GNT2 structures, whereas they are disordered in the Fringe structure. Three disulfide bonds are observed in B3GNT2: Cys96-Cys125 in the helical domain; Cys138-Cys235 and Cys367-Cys397 in the catalytic domain. In addition, glycans could be assigned for three glycosylation sites: Asn127 in the linker; Asn173 and Asn219 in the catalytic domain (Fig. S2A). The second GlcNAc ring of glycosylated Asn127 potentially forms hydrogen bonds with residues of the helical domain (Fig. S2E). Glycosylated Asn173 appears to be solvent exposed and the attached glycan has sufficient electron density only in certain chains in the B3GNT2 structures reported here. Glycosylated Asn219 is buried between the helical domain and the catalytic domain, with its first two GlcNAc rings stacked against Tyr122 of the helical domain and hydrogen bonded to both the helical domain and the catalytic domain (Fig. S2E). The N-terminal domain of luminal B3GNT2 adopts a loose helical bundle with three helices α1’, α2’, and α3’ (Fig. 1D and S3) and neither Dali nor PDBeFold search showed any result with significant structural similarity. α1’ and α3’ helices are parallel to each other, whereas the shortest α2’ helix is positioned above them at a 60° angle (Fig. S3). These three α helices are connected by two flexible loops each containing a one-turn 310 helix. Although this three-helix bundle is not as tight as a typical three-helix bundle, there are some significant interactions within the helical domain, such as the hydrogen bonding network formed by Tyr58, Glu62, Lys65, Asp99, and Arg124. (Fig. 2A). In addition, the α1’-α2’ loop is covalently locked to the C terminus of the helical domain through Cys96-Cys125 disulfide bond (Fig. 2A). The helical domain makes extensive contacts with the catalytic domain, primarily the β5-β6 loop and the α6-α7 loop, and together bury a surface area of over 2500 Å2, hydrophilic on one side and hydrophobic on the other. Residues from the α1’ helix (Tyr58, Trp59, and Asn60) form hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogens and oxygens of Val294, Val295, Ser297, and Gly298 from the β5-β6 loop (Fig. 2B). And residues from both the α1’ helix (Glu62 and Gln63) and loop regions (Asn71, His92, and Leu123) are involved in hydrogen bond interactions with residues from the α6-α7 loop (Asp324, Gln325, His327, and Leu328) (Fig. 2B). In addition, there are also extensive hydrophobic interactions between the helical domain and the catalytic domain including residues Trp59 (from the α1’ helix), Val106 (from the α2’-α3’ loop), Phe116, Phe119, Leu120, Leu123 (all four from the α3’ helix), and residues Tyr290, Ile291, Val294, Val295, Tyr296 (all five from the β5-β6 loop), Val326, Leu328, Tyr329, Pro330 (all four from the α6-α7 loop) (Fig. 2C). By soaking B3GNT2 crystals with either the donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc or the acceptor substrate LacNAc, we were able to obtain B3GNT2 structures (B3GNT2_UDPGlcNAc and B3GNT2_LacNAc) in the substrate-bound states. The substrate-binding cleft is located on one end of the core β sheet of the catalytic domain (Figs. 1D and 2D). In the B3GNT2_UDPGlcNAc structure, the donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc is positioned at the bottom of the cleft with the GlcNAc moiety close to the center of the cleft (Figure 1, Figure 2A and 2E). The side chains of Asp215 and Lys223 are hydrogen bonded to the uracil ring of the UDP moiety, whereas the side chain of Asp246 is hydrogen bonded to the ribose hydroxyls. The pyrophosphate group of UDP clamps the divalent Mg ion in a bidentate manner. Two pyrophosphate oxygen atoms, Asp247 from the signature DXD motif (Asp245-Asp246-Asp247 in B3GNT2) (17Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Glycosyltransferases: structures, functions, and mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar), a conserved His376, and two water molecules, coordinate the Mg ion with the tetragonal bipyramidal geometry. The side chains of Lys149, Asp245 (the other Asp from the signature DXD motif), Tyr289, and Asp332 are involved in hydrogen bond interactions with the GlcNAc moiety with Asp245 engaged in additional interaction with the nitrogen of the N-acetyl group. These interactions force the GlcNAc moiety to bend toward the cleft wall, almost perpendicular to the pyrophosphate and parallel to the uracil ring, and fully expose the C1 atom for the nucleophilic attack. The acceptor substrate LacNAc (Galβ1-4GlcNAc) is bound to the top of the cleft and more solvent exposed (Fig. S4B and 2F). The Gal ring for the anticipated glycosidic bond formation reaction is located close to the center of the cleft, whereas the GlcNAc ring is close to the solvent. The hydroxyls of the Gal ring are engaged in direct hydrogen bond interactions with the side chains of His282 and Asp333 and water-mediated hydrogen bond interaction with the side chain of Tyr300. The Gal ring is also stacked against the side chain of Tyr289. In contrast, the GlcNAc ring is only involved in a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen of Gly280 through one of its hydroxyls. Biophysical binding interactions of the substrates (UDP-GlcNAc and LacNAc) and the product (UDP) to B3GNT2 coupled to streptavidin sensor were measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). A 1:1 binding was assumed based on the crystal structures, which clearly reveal the stoichiometry of the reaction. The steady-state (equilibrium) binding affinities (KD) of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP were calculated to be ∼140 μM (Fig. 3B) and ∼260 μM (Fig. 3D), respectively, whereas the binding affinity of LacNAc could not be measured reliably (likely millimolar KD) owing to very weak binding signal (Fig. 3E). The simple 1:1 kinetic model fitted (Fig. 3A and C) double referenced binding data of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP suggested weak binding affinity with B3GNT2 (partial ligand occupancy with nonsaturation up till 200 μM top concentration with rapid equilibrium and fast dissociation), a profile characteristic of small molecule binders with weak (in the micromolar range) affinity. Two-substrate reactions catalyzed by enzymes can proceed through either a sequential mechanism or a ping-pong mechanism (18Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1975Google Scholar). In a sequential mechanism, both substrates must bind to the enzyme to form the ternary complex before catalysis can occur. In contrast, in a ping-pong mechanism, one product must be released before the other substrate can react. To determine the kinetic mechanism of B3GNT2, we measured the initial velocities at various concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc and LacNAc using the UDP-Glo assay (Fig. 4, A and B) and constructed the double-reciprocal plots of the initial velocities versus the substrate concentrations (Fig. 4, C and D). The lines in the double-reciprocal plots intersect, indicating that B3GNT2 utilizes a sequential mechanism rather than a Ping-Pong mechanism. In addition, the pattern of the intersecting lines in the double-reciprocal plots excludes a rapid-equilibrium compulsory-order sequential mechanism because this mechanism requires the lines in the double-reciprocal plot to intersect on the y-axis. Since we were able to obtain the structures of the binary enzyme–substrate complexes for both UDP-GlcNAc and LacNAc and SPR data showed fast-on and fast-off binding kinetics for both substrates, we fit the initial velocities at various substrate concentrations to the rapid-equilibrium random-order sequential mechanism (Equation 1). The kinetic parameters obtained from the fit are: KUDP-GlcNAc = 216 ± 36 μM, KLacNAc = 8.99 ± 1.75 mM, α = 0.24 ± 0.06, and kcat = 35.8 ± 0.7 min−1. The equilibrium dissociation constants of the binary enzyme–substrate complex obtained from kinetic analysis (216 μM for UDP-GlcNAc and 8.99 mM for LacNAc) are similar to the values measured by the SPR study. The cooperativity factor of α (0.24) obtained from the fit indicates that the two substrates have positive binding cooperativity and they are held about fourfold more tightly in the ternary complex. The catalytic constant (kcat) of B3GNT2 (35.8 min−1) is within the range reported for other glycosyltransferases, which typically have low turnover numbers (19Ha S. Chang E. Lo M.-C. Men H. Park P. Ge M. Walker S. The kinetic characterization of Escherichia coli MurG using synthetic substrate analogues.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 8415-8426Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A sequential mechanism of the B3GNT2 reaction implies that both substrates can bind the enzyme at the same time. And superposition of the B3GNT2_UDPGlcNAc and B3GNT2_LacNAc structures shows that the acceptor substrate LacNAc binds right above the donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc in the substrate-binding cleft. The hydroxyl group on C3 of the Gal in the acceptor substrate points to the C1 of the GlcNAc in the donor substrate at a distance of 3.7 Å (Fig. 5A). To obtain a ternary complex structure, we soaked B3GNT2 crystals with both donor and acceptor substrates as well as magnesium ion at the same time. Interestingly, electron density was clearly observed for both products UDP and trisaccharide GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc but no remaining density for the residual substrates UDP-GlcNAc or LacNAc, indicating that the glycosyltransferase reaction took place during soaking and the products were not yet released. As a result, we were able to obtain the crystal structure of B3GNT2 with both products bound (B3GNT2_tri_UDP) (Fig. S4C and 2G). Structural comparison of the product-bound and the substrate-bound B3GNT2 reveals a clear picture of the inverting glycosyltransferase reaction. The Asp333, which is 2.7 Å from the hydroxyl group on C3 of Gal in the acceptor substrate LacNAc, serves as the active site base and abstracts the proton from this hydroxyl group (Fig. 2F). This facilitates the nucleophilic attack on the exposed C1 of the GlcNAc in the donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc, which undergoes an oxocarbenium ion–like transition state (17Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Glycosyltransferases: structures, functions, and mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5E). Owing to arrangement of the two substrates in the active site, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the si face of the transition state oxocarbenium ion, while the UDP leaves from the re face. Consequently, the C-P bond breaks in UDP-GlcNAc and the new β-1,3-glysosidic bond forms between GlcNAc and Gal, accompanied by GlcNAc converting from α anomer to β anomer (Fig. 5B). The GlcNAc ring therefore rotates by 30°, losing interactions with Tyr289 but establishing new hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of Gly306 through its N-acetyl group (Fig. 5C). The pyrophosphate of UDP is also able to rotate slightly to release the torsion and be further stabilized by Tyr289 and Lys288 (Fig. 5C). Notably, all the other residues coordinating the two products are the same residues recognizing the two substrates and they undergo minimal conformational changes during the reaction. To capture the conformations of the enzyme during the entire reaction cycle, we also determined two more structures of B3GNT2: unliganded and bound to only UDP (for the state when GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc is released) (Fig. S4D). Comparison of the unliganded structure to the substrate-bound or the product-bound structure demonstrates that the substrate-binding cleft of apo B3GNT2 is available to accommodate substrates for the reaction to occur. Nevertheless, some subtle conformational changes in the cleft have been observed at different stages of the reaction cycle (Fig. S7). One example is the catalytic residue Asp333 aforementioned. The side chain of Asp333 points away in apo B3GNT2 (Fig. S7, A and B) but rotates to engage the substrates upon binding of either the donor or the acceptor substrate (Fig. S7, C and D). It stays engaged after the reaction (Fig. S7E) and only to disengage after the release of the product GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc (Fig. S7F). To evaluate the importance of specific residues in catalysis and substrate recognition, we reconstituted B3GNT2-deficient Jurkat cells with various point mutants and assessed polylactosamine levels via flow cytometry using the LEA lectin derived from Lycopersicon esculentum.

https://openalex.org/W3095734785,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in Bhutan despite the implementation of directly observed treatment short-course since 1997. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice on TB among the teacher trainees of Samtse College of Education. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted among the teacher trainees of Samtse College of Education. A standardized pretested questionnaire was distributed and self-administered. The participants were selected randomly using randomization. The data was entered in Epi-data 4.4.2.1 and analysed using STATA version 13. A score of 1 point for a correct answer and 0 for wrong/don’t know answer was given. The knowledge, attitude and practice score were divided into good and poor based on 50% cut off. Logistic regression was used for the analysis to identify the significant covariates. Results A total of 420 trainees responded to the survey questionnaire. The average knowledge score on TB was 10.7 (Range = 0–21). Two hundred and forty respondents (58.6%) had low knowledge (mean score 7.8±2.5) on TB. Cough, chest pain and weight loss were correctly reported as the symptoms of TB by 306 (72.9%), 187(44.5%) and 187 (44.5%) participants. Eighty-nine-point five percent (376) of participants reported coughing as the main route of TB transmission and 85% (357) of the participants said that it could be prevented by covering the mouth while coughing. In multivariable analysis; the trainees in the junior years of college had good knowledge of TB compared with the senior years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18–3.5; p-value 0.011). Respondents previously treated for TB were more likely to have good knowledge on TB compared to those who never had TB in the past (AOR 2.39; 95% CI 1.07–5.31; p-value 0.033). The majority (93%) of respondents had a good attitude towards TB cases. Female trainees were 2.4 (95% CI 1.02–5.62; p-value 0.045) times more likely than male trainees to have a positive attitude towards TB. Eighty-eight percent of the respondents reported that they would visit the hospital if they had TB symptoms. The mean score for the practice on TB was 1.33±0.59 (Range:0–2). Conclusion In this study, the majority of the trainees had poor knowledge on TB, especially among the trainees in senior years of college and those who had never suffered from TB. The attitude towards TB was good especially among the female trainees. However, the overall practice was poor among the participants. Therefore, the Ministry of Health should collaborate with relevant stakeholders especially the Ministry of Education to incorporate topics on TB in the syllabus of students and colleges to create awareness on it."
https://openalex.org/W3096421494,"In order to further improve the utilization of solar energy in Chinese Solar Greenhouse (CSG), this paper systematically studied the effects of orientation and structure on solar radiation interception in CSG. A solar radiation model has been developed based on the previous research, which taking solar motion law, meteorological data, and optical properties of materials into consideration. The established model was used to optimize the orientation and structure of CSG. The analysis of structure considered two major structural parameters, which are the ridge height and the horizontal projection of the rear roof. Moreover, the widely used Liao-Shen type Chinese solar greenhouse (CSG-LS) has been taken as the prototype in the present research, and the measured data of the typical clear day was used for the model validation. The results showed that the ridge height has a remarkable influence on the solar energy captured by CSG-LS. Compared with the optimization of a single factor, the comprehensive optimization of orientation and structure can increase the solar radiation interception of the rear wall by 3.95%. Considering the limiting factor of heat storage-release capacity and the shading effect on the greenhouse structure, the optimal lighting construction of the CSG-LS (with a span of 9.0 m) was specified as 7~9° from south to west of azimuth angle, 4.5~4.7 m ridge height, and 1.4~1.6 m horizontal projection of the rear roof at 42°N latitude. The proposed solar radiation model can provide scientific guidance for the CSG-LS construction in different areas."
https://openalex.org/W3096766267,"Effectively planning conservation introductions involves assessing the suitability of both donor and recipient populations, including the landscape of disease risk. Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has caused extensive amphibian declines globally and may hamper reintroduction attempts. To determine Bd dynamics in potential source populations for conservation translocations of the threatened California red-legged frog ( Rana draytonii ) to Yosemite National Park, we conducted Bd sampling in two populations in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, U.S.A. At one of two sites, we observed lethally high Bd loads in early post-metamorphic life stages and confirmed one chytridiomycosis-induced mortality, the first such report for this species. These results informed source population site selection for subsequent R . draytonii conservation translocations. Conservation efforts aimed at establishing new populations of R . draytonii in a landscape where Bd is ubiquitous can benefit from an improved understanding of risk through disease monitoring and ex situ infection studies."
https://openalex.org/W3097020863,"Objective To determine the psychometric properties of the Person-Centered Therapeutic Relationship in Physiotherapy Scale (PCTR-PT) in order to find the most appropriate fit for the tool. Methods Patients who had received treatment at the physiotherapy service of nine hospitals in Spain were invited to complete the 31 items of the PCTR-PT scale. To select the most appropriate items of the PCTR-PT, an exploratory factorial analysis (EFA) was performed using the maximum likelihood and oblique rotation (promin) methods. Factor validity, goodness-of-fit and psychometric properties were analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Convergent (CFA) and discriminant validity were calculated. Internal consistency was verified using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to examine temporal stability. Results 366 patients over 18 years old who had received, at least, 15 physiotherapy treatment sessions completed the questionnaire. The results of the exploratory factor analysis revealed a tool with 15 items in four factors [Relational Bond (N items = 4); Individualized Partnership (N items = 4); Professional Empowerment (N items = 3) and Therapeutic Communication (N items = 4)], explaining 78.4% of the variance of the total variables of this tool. The confirmatory factor analysis further confirmed the four-structure model. Reliability of the tool was approved by Cronbach's alpha in all four dimensions, as all were above .70, ranging from .84 (Individualized Partnership) to .91 (Professional Empowerment). = 0.94. Test-retest was performed with two-week intervals, indicating an appropriate stability for the scale (ICC = 0.900). Conclusion The Person-Centered Therapeutic Relationship in Physiotherapy Scale (PCTR-PT) is a useful, valid and applicable instrument to evaluate the person-centered therapeutic relationship during physiotherapy interventions. It would be interesting to investigate the predictive capacity (sensitivity and specificity) of the PCTR-PT scale."
https://openalex.org/W3097325565,"Sequence logos have been widely used as graphical representations of conserved nucleic acid and protein motifs. Due to the complexity of the amino acid (AA) alphabet, rich post-translational modification, and diverse subcellular localization of proteins, few versatile tools are available for effective identification and visualization of protein motifs. In addition, various reduced AA alphabets based on physicochemical, structural, or functional properties have been valuable in the study of protein alignment, folding, structure prediction, and evolution. However, there is lack of tools for applying reduced AA alphabets to the identification and visualization of statistically significant motifs. To fill this gap, we developed an R/Bioconductor package dagLogo, which has several advantages over existing tools. First, dagLogo allows various formats for input sets and provides comprehensive options to build optimal background models. It implements different reduced AA alphabets to group AAs of similar properties. Furthermore, dagLogo provides statistical and visual solutions for differential AA (or AA group) usage analysis of both large and small data sets. Case studies showed that dagLogo can better identify and visualize conserved protein sequence patterns from different types of inputs and can potentially reveal the biological patterns that could be missed by other logo generators."

https://openalex.org/W3097222908,"Herein, the interaction among the antidepressant drug amitriptyline hydrochloride (AMT) and a green gemini surfactant, ethane-1, 2-diyl bis(N,N-dimethyl-N-tetradecylammoniumacetoxy) dichloride (14-E2-14), via numerous techniques such as tensiometry, fluorimetry, FT-IR and UV-visible spectroscopy in three different media (aqueous 0.050 mol·kg -1 NaCl, 0.50 and 1.0 mol·kg -1 urea) were investigated. AMT is used to treat mental illness or mood problems, such as depression. The aggregation of biologically active ingredients can enhance the bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs. A significant interaction between AMT and 14-E2-14 was detected by tensiometric study as the critical micelle concentration ( cmc ) of AMT+14-E2-14 is reduced upon an increase of mole fraction ( α 1 ) of 14-E2-14. The decrease in cmc indicates the nonideality of studied mixtures of different compositions. Although, employed drug AMT is freely soluble in the aqueous and non-aqueous system but is not hydrophobic enough to act as its carrier. Instead, gemini surfactant formed spherical micelles in an aqueous system and their high solubilization capability, as well as their relatively lower cmc value, makes them highly stable in vivo. The cmc values of AMT+14-E-14 mixtures in all cases were further decreased and increased in NaCl and urea solutions respectively as compared with the aqueous system. Numerous micellar, interfacial, and thermodynamic parameters have been measured by applying various theoretical models. The obtained changes in the physicochemical assets of AMT upon adding of 14-E2-14 are likely to enhance the industrial and pharmaceutical applications of gemini surfactants. The negative interaction parameters ( β m and β σ ), indicate synergistic attraction is occurring in the mixed systems. The aggregation number ( N agg ), Stern–Volmer constant ( K sv ), etc. are attained through the fluorescence method, also supporting the attractive interaction behavior of AMT+14-E2-14 mixtures in all solvents. The N agg was found to increase in the salt solution and decrease in the urea system compared with the aqueous solution. FT-IR and UV-visible analysis also depict the interaction between the constituent alike tensiometry and fluorimetry methods. The results suggested that gemini surfactants may serve as a capable drug delivery agent for antidepressants, improving their bioavailability."
https://openalex.org/W3096556383,"Background The transition to university often involves a change in living arrangement for many first-year students. While weight gain during first year of university has been well documented, Canadian literature on the impact of living arrangement within this context is limited. The objective of this investigation was to explore the effect of living arrangement on anthropometric traits in first-year university students from Ontario, Canada. Methods 244 first-year undergraduate students were followed longitudinally with data collected early in the academic year and towards the end of the year. Anthropometric parameters including weight, waist and hip circumference, body mass index (BMI), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were examined. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for pairwise comparison of traits from the beginning to end the year in the absence of adjustments. Additionally, linear regression models with covariate adjustments were used to investigate effect of the type of living arrangement (i.e. on-campus, off-campus, or family home) on the aforementioned traits. Results In the overall sample, a significant weight increase of 1.55kg (95% CI: 1.24–1.86) was observed over the school year (p&lt;0.001), which was also accompanied by significant gains in BMI, and waist and hip circumferences (p&lt;0.001). At baseline, no significant differences were found between people living on-campus, off-campus, and at home with family. Stratified analysis of change by type of living arrangement indicated significant gains across all traits among students living on-campus (p&lt;0.05), and significant gains in weight and BMI among students living at home with family. Additionally, a comparison between living arrangements revealed that students living on campus experienced significantly larger gains in weight and BMI compared to students living off-campus (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion Our findings indicate that living arrangement is associated with different weight gain trajectories in first-year university students."

Methods The study compared 272 eyes from 137 PA patients and 352 eyes from 177 control subjects selected randomly from 1173 participants of a public glaucoma screening. The presence of glaucomatous optic disc appearance (rim thinning and cup enlargement) and retinal nerve fiber layer defects (RNFLDs) was determined independently from fundus photographs. The results were compared between the PA and control groups. Results There were 9 patients (6.6%) with glaucomatous optic disc abnormalities in the PA group and 10 cases (5.6%) identified in the control group (p = 0.92). RNFLDs were detected more frequently in the PA group (55 eyes, 20.2%) than in the control group (26 eyes, 7.4%; p&lt;0.001). The two types of RNFLDs were classified as either having their central ends at the disc margin (D) or away from the disc margin and around the retinal vessels (V). Type D and V RNFLDs were detected in 35 (12.9%) and 26 (9.6%) eyes in the PA group and in 25 (7.1%) and 4 (1.1%) eyes in the control group, respectively. Both types of RNFLDs were more frequent in the PA group than in the control group (Type D and V, p = 0.03, &lt;0.001, respectively). Conclusion Although the prevalence of glaucomatous optic disc appearance did not differ between the two groups, RNFLDs were more frequent in PA patients than in the control group. Moreover, RNFLDs with their central ends located around retinal vessels were characteristic of PA patients."
https://openalex.org/W3095052545,"In this article, we compared the content validity of two instruments used in measuring pediatric pain knowledge and attitudes. This was considered necessary due to the universal differences in culture, semantics and healthcare resources in different parts of the globe. Thirteen (13) pediatric experts in Ghana assessed the content validity of two instruments: the 42-item Pediatric Nurses' Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain (PNKAS) and the 41-item Pediatric Healthcare Providers’ Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain (PHPKASRP). The relevance and clarity of each item on these instruments were rated on a four-point likert scaled options from 1 (not relevant/ not clear) to 4 (very relevant/ very clear). The item-level content validity index (I-CVI) was calculated by dividing the number of experts who rated an item with 3 or 4 by the total number of experts. The average scale-level content validity index (S-CVI/Ave) was also estimated by summing up the I-CVIs of all items and dividing them by the total number of items. The I-CVIs on the PNKAS ranged from 0.62 to 1.00 for the relevance component and 0.69 to 1.00 for the clarity component. The I-CVIs on the PHPKASRP ranged from 0.62 to 1.00 for both the relevance and clarity components. The S-CVI/Ave were 0.87 and 0.89 for the relevance and clarity aspects on the PNKAS respectively. The S-CVI/Ave for the PHPKASRP instrument were 0.86 and 0.89 for the relevance and clarity aspects correspondingly. At the end of the validation process, 5 items were revised on both instruments whilst 37 and 36 items were maintained on the PNKAS and PHPKASRP instruments respectively. The PNKAS and PHPKASRP have an acceptable level of content validity in the Ghanaian context and recommended for educational and research purposes. Other forms of validity and reliability of these instruments should also be examined in future studies."

This study aimed to identify the change in outcomes over a decade and effect of citywide intervention on good neurologic outcomes after OHCAs in Daegu. This is a before- and after-intervention study to examine the association between the citywide intervention to improve the chain of survival and outcomes after OHCA. The primary outcome was a good neurologic outcome, defined as a cerebral performance category score of 1 or 2. After dividing into 3 phases according to the citywide intervention, the trends in outcomes after OHCA by primary electrocardiogram rhythm were assessed. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between the phases and outcomes. Overall, 6203 patients with OHCA were eligible. For 10 years (2008–2017), the rate of survival to discharge and the good neurologic outcomes increased from 2.6% to 8.7% and from 1.5% to 6.6%, respectively. Especially for patients with an initial shockable rhythm, these changes in outcomes were more pronounced (survival to discharge: 23.3% in 2008 to 55.0% in 2017, good neurologic outcomes: 13.3% to 46.0%). Compared with phase 1, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for good neurologic outcomes was 1.20 (95% CI: 0.78–1.85) for phase 2 and 1.64 (1.09–2.46) for phase 3. For patients with an initial shockable rhythm, the AOR for good neurologic outcomes was 3.76 (1.88–7.52) for phase 2 and 5.51 (2.77–10.98) for phase 3. Citywide improvement was observed in the good neurologic outcomes after OHCAs of medical origin, and the citywide intervention was significantly associated with better outcomes, particularly in those with initial shockable rhythm."

Then, the obstacles to land-based ecological security were diagnosed. The results show that the values of the comprehensive evaluation index of land-based ecological security were 0.28–0.66 in the period from 2006 to 2017. The value of the index of land-based ecological security was low in the first seven years and gradually improved in the last five years of the study period. However, the overall situation was grave, and the ecological security conditions were poor. The main obstacles to land-based ecological security were the usage of pesticides, investment in environmental pollution treatments, the degree of machine cultivation, the rate of cultivation and the usage of fertilizer in Xingtai city. Based on the results of the land-based ecological security evaluation and the main obstacles identified in Xingtai city, this paper proposes management strategies and suggestions for improving land-based ecological security in Xingtai city. The specific proposals are as follows: vigorously develop green agriculture, increase investment in environmental pollution control, increase input in science and technology, and strengthen supervision and management of land use."

Although gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) are generally expected to be safe, the recent study contains conflicting data regarding their cytotoxicity in the darkling beetles Trachyderma hispida . The study postulated cellular perturbation in the ovarian tissue of the beetles induced by a sublethal dose of Au-NPs (0.01 mg/g). When compared with the controls, a significant inhibition in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes selenium-dependent (GPOX) and selenium-independent (GSTP) glutathione peroxidases (GPx) was observed in the treated beetles. The study proposed microRNAs (miRNA-282 and miRNA-989) as genotoxic markers for the first time, reporting a significant suppression in their transcriptional levels in the treated beetles. Furthermore, TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) and flow cytometry assays (annexin V-Fitc) indicated a significant increase in ovarian cell apoptosis in the treated beetles. Additionally, an ultrastructure examination revealed pathological changes in the ovarian cells of the treated beetles. The resulting anomalies in the present study may interrupt the fecundity of the beetles and lead to the future suppression of beetle populations."

In many rural areas of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) in South Africa, for instance, the most widely used languages include Zulu and Xhosa, with only limited comprehension in English and Afrikaans. Health care practitioners for HIV diagnosis and treatment, often, cannot communicate efficiently with their indigenous ethnic patients. An informatics tool is urgently needed to facilitate these health care professionals for better communication with their patients during HIV diagnosis. Here, we apply fuzzy logic and speech technology and develop a fuzzy logic HIV diagnostic system with indigenous multi-lingual interfaces, named Multi-linguAl HIV indigenouS fuzzy logiC - based diagnOstic sysTem (MAVSCOT). This HIV multilingual informatics software can facilitate the diagnosis in underprivileged rural African communities. We provide examples on how MAVSCOT can be applied towards HIV diagnosis by using existing data from the literature. Compared to other similar tools, MAVSCOT can perform better due to its implementation of the fuzzy logic. We hope MAVSCOT would help health care practitioners working in indigenous communities of many African countries, to efficiently diagnose HIV and ultimately control its transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3097291001,"Background Laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a popular bariatric procedure performed in Asia, as obesity continues to be on the rise in our population. A major problem faced is the development of de novo gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) after LSG, which can be chronic and debilitating. In this study, we aim to assess the relationship between the presence of small hiatal hernia (HH) and the development of postoperative GERD, as well as to explore the correlation between GERD symptoms after LSG and timing of meals. In doing so, we hope to gain a better understanding about the type of reflux that occurs after LSG and take a step closer towards effectively managing this difficult to treat condition. Methods We retrospectively reviewed data collected from patients who underwent LSG in our hospital from Dec 2008 to Dec 2016. All patients underwent preoperative upper GI endoscopy, during which the identification of hiatal hernia takes place. Patients' information and reflux symptoms are recorded using standardized questionnaires, which are administered preoperatively, and again during postoperative follow up visits. Results Of the 255 patients, 125 patients (74%) developed de novo GERD within 6 months post-sleeve gastrectomy. The rate of de novo GERD was 57.1% in the group with HH, and 76.4% in the group without HH. Adjusted analysis showed no significant association between HH and GERD (RR = 0.682; 95% CI 0.419 to 1.111; P = 0.125). 88% of the patients who developed postoperative GERD reported postprandial symptoms occurring only after meals, and the remaining 12% of patients reported no correlation between the timing of GERD symptoms and meals. Conclusion There is no direct correlation between the presence of small hiatal hernia and GERD symptoms after LSG. Hence, the presence of a small sliding hiatal hernia should not be exclusion for sleeve gastrectomy. Electing not to perform concomitant hiatal hernia repair also does not appear to result in higher rates of postoperative or de novo GERD."
https://openalex.org/W3095656296,"We report a study on toxoplasmosis in pregnant women in Luanda, Angola, determining the seroprevalence, geospatial distribution and its association with socio-economic features, dietary habits and hygiene and health conditions. Anti- Toxoplasma gondii IgG and IgM were quantified in serum samples of women attended at the Lucrecia Paim Maternity Hospital between May 2016 and August 2017. The IgG avidity test and qPCR assay were used for dating the primary infection. Data were collected by questionnaire after written consent, and spatial distribution was assessed through a Kernel Density Function. The potential risk factors associated with Toxoplasma infection were evaluated using bivariate and multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis. Anti- T . gondii antibodies were quantified in 878 pregnant women, and 346 (39.4%) samples were IgG positive, 2 (0.2%) positive for IgM and IgG, and 530 (60.4%) negative for both immunoglobulins. The longitudinal study showed that none of the seronegative women seroconverted during the survey. Regarding other infections, 226 (25.7%) were positive for hepatitis B, while 118 (13.4%) were HIV-positive. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis was similar in most municipalities: 43.8% in Cazenga (28 of 64); 42.5% in Viana (88 of 207); 42.3% in Cacuaco (22 of 52); and 41.1% in Luanda ((179 of 435). In contrast, the seroprevalence in municipality of Belas was lower (25.8%; 31 of 120) and bivariate and multivariate analysis has shown a lower risk for toxoplasmosis in this area (OR 0.479, CI: 0.305–0.737; OR 0.471, CI: 0.299–0.728). The multivariate analysis has shown a significant increased risk for toxoplasmosis in women in the last trimester of pregnancy (OR 1.457, CI: 1.011–2.102), suffering spontaneous abortion (OR 1.863, CI: 1.014–3.465) and having pets at home (OR 1.658, CI: 1.212–2.269). Also, women who tested positive for hepatitis B (OR 1.375, CI: 1.008–1.874) and HIV (OR 1.833, CI: 1.233–2.730) had a significant increased risk for T . gondii infection. In conclusion, our study showed that a large number of pregnant women are not immunized for toxoplasmosis and identified the risk factors for this infection in Luanda. It is crucial to establish the diagnosis of primary maternal infection as well as the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis. Our results underlined the need for diagnostic and clinical follow-up of toxoplasmosis, HIV and hepatitis B during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3096052559,"Predicting the future is essential for organisms like Homo sapiens , who live in a dynamic and ever-changing world. Previous research has established that conscious stimuli can lead to non-conscious predictions. Here we examine whether masked stimuli can also induce such predictions. We use masked movement–with and without obstacles–to examine predictions from masked stimuli. In six experiments a moving object was masked using continuous flash suppression (CFS). A few hundred milliseconds after the object had disappeared, a conscious probe appeared in a location that was either consistent with the masked stimulus or not. In Experiments 1–3 the movement was linear, and reaction times (RTs) indicated predictions that were based on direction and speed of movement. In Experiment 4, the masked moving object collided with an obstacle and then disappeared. Predictions in this case should reflect deflection, and indeed reaction times revealed predictions on the deflection route. In Experiments 5 and 6 we introduce an innovative way of using eye-tracking during continuous flash suppression (CFS) and report physiological evidence–in the forms of eye-movements–for masked stimuli induced predictions. We thus conclude that humans can use dynamic masked stimuli to generate active predictions about the future, and use these predictions to guide behavior. We also discuss the possible interpretations of these findings in light of the current scientific discussion regarding the relation between masked presentation, subliminal perception and awareness measurement methods."
https://openalex.org/W3096305291,"Time series gene expression data is widely used to study different dynamic biological processes. Although gene expression datasets share many of the characteristics of time series data from other domains, most of the analyses in this field do not fully leverage the time-ordered nature of the data and focus on clustering the genes based on their expression values. Other domains, such as financial stock and weather prediction, utilize time series data for forecasting purposes. Moreover, many studies have been conducted to classify generic time series data based on trend, seasonality, and other patterns. Therefore, an assessment of these approaches on gene expression data would be of great interest to evaluate their adequacy in this domain. Here, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of different traditional unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches as well as deep learning based techniques for time series gene expression classification and forecasting on five real datasets. In addition, we propose deep learning based methods for both classification and forecasting, and compare their performances with the state-of-the-art methods. We find that deep learning based methods generally outperform traditional approaches for time series classification. Experiments also suggest that supervised classification on gene expression is more effective than clustering when labels are available. In time series gene expression forecasting, we observe that an autoregressive statistical approach has the best performance for short term forecasting, whereas deep learning based methods are better suited for long term forecasting."
https://openalex.org/W3097554685,"Human stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) is a glycoprotein known to participate in inflammation and tumor progression. However, its role in cancer-macrophage interaction at the tumor environment is not known. In this study, the co-culture of the human metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (MHCC97L) stably transfected with a control vector (MHCC97L/P), or STC1-overexpressing vector (MHCC97L/S1) with human leukemia monocytic cell line (THP-1) was conducted. We reported that MHCC97L/S1 suppressed the migratory activity of THP-1. Real-time PCR analysis revealed the downregulation of the pro-migratory factors, monocyte-chemoattractant protein receptors, CCR2 and CCR4, and macrophage-migratory cytokine receptor, CSF-1R. Transcriptomic analysis of the THP-1 cells co-cultured with either MHCC97L/P or MHCC97L/S1, detected 1784 differentially expressed genes. The Ingenuity Canonical Pathway analysis predicted that RhoA signaling was associated with the inhibition of the cell migration. Western blot analysis revealed a significant reduction of Ser19-phosphorylation on MLC2, a Rho-A downstream target, in the THP-1 cells. Xenograft tumors derived from MHCC97/S1 in mice showed a remarkable decrease in infiltrating macrophages. Collectively, this is the first report to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of STC1-overexpressing cancer cells on macrophage migration/infiltration. Our data support further investigations on the relationship between tumor STC1 level and macrophage infiltration."
https://openalex.org/W3094859625,"In response to stagnant Federal grant funding levels and to catalyze early stage or high-risk research not currently supported by the NIH, many academic medical centers (AMCs) provide supplemental intramural funding to faculty investigators. However, it can be challenging to decide how to deploy these funds for maximum impact. We conducted a retrospective, descriptive analysis to explore trends in applications and awards associated with an institution-wide intramural funding center at a major U.S. AMC. From 2010 to 2017, the Brigham Research Institute at Brigham and Women’s Hospital awarded a total of 354 grants totaling over $9 million to affiliated researchers through six distinct and complementary grant programs. The number of applicants remained essentially stable, despite expansion of the funding program portfolio. Distribution of applicants and awardees by academic rank and gender generally reflected that of medical school faculty at large. This descriptive analysis demonstrates interest in a diverse range of intramural funding programs among AMC faculty, and a lack of overt rank or gender bias in the programs’ awardees. However, it highlights the institution’s need to better understand the amount of residual unmet demand for intramural funding; the degree to which underrepresented constituencies can and should be actively supported; and the “return on investment” of these grants."
https://openalex.org/W3097127302,"In plant cytokinesis, de novo formation of a cell plate evolving into the new cell wall partitions the cytoplasm of the dividing cell. In our earlier chemical genomics studies, we identified and characterized the small molecule endosidin-7, that specifically inhibits callose deposition at the cell plate, arresting late-stage cytokinesis in arabidopsis. Endosidin-7 has emerged as a very valuable tool for dissecting this essential plant process. To gain insights regarding its mode of action and the effects of cytokinesis inhibition on the overall plant response, we investigated the effect of endosidin-7 through a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) metabolomics approach. In this case study, metabolomics profiles of arabidopsis leaf and root tissues were analyzed at different growth stages and endosidin-7 exposure levels. The results show leaf and root-specific metabolic profile changes and the effects of endosidin-7 treatment on these metabolomes. Statistical analyses indicated that the effect of endosidin-7 treatment was more significant than the developmental impact. The endosidin-7 induced metabolic profiles suggest compensations for cytokinesis inhibition in central metabolism pathways. This study further shows that long-term treatment of endosidin-7 profoundly changes, likely via alteration of hormonal regulation, the primary metabolism of arabidopsis seedlings. Hormonal pathway-changes are likely reflecting the plant's responses, compensating for the arrested cell division, which in turn are leading to global metabolite modulation. The presented NMR spectral data are made available through the Metabolomics Workbench, providing a reference resource for the scientific community."
https://openalex.org/W3097401595,"Objective The present study aimed (1) to examine the association between circulating inflammatory biomarkers and academic performance in adolescents, and (2) to identify the ability of circulating inflammatory biomarkers to predict low academic performance. Methods A total of 244 adolescents (13.9±0.3 years, 112 girls) from the DADOS study were included in the analysis. Four inflammatory biomarkers were quantified: white blood cell (WBC) count, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Academic performance was assessed through academic grades and the Spanish version of the Science Research Associates Test of Educational Abilities. Results TNF-α was inversely associated with math, Spanish and grade point average (β ranging from -0.166 to -0.124; all p&lt;0.05), while CRP was inversely associated with verbal ability (β = -0.128; p&lt;0.05). Overall, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analyses showed discriminatory ability of WBC and TNF-α in identifying low academic performance (all p&lt;0.05). Moreover, logistic regression analyses indicated that students with levels of WBC and TNF-α above the ROC cut-offs values showed between 78% to 87% increased likelihood of lower academic performance (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Our findings suggested that some circulating inflammatory biomarkers were associated with academic performance in adolescents. Further larger longitudinal and interventional studies are needed to clarify the short-term and long-term relationship between inflammation and academic performance in youths."
https://openalex.org/W3095297257,"Background Since 2010 there has been a growing population of refugees and asylum seekers in Latin America. This study sought to investigate the perceived experiences and healthcare needs of refugees and asylum seekers of Latin American origin in Chile in order to identify main barriers to healthcare and provide guidance on allied challenges for the public healthcare system. Methods Descriptive qualitative case study with semi-structured interviews applied to refugees and asylum seekers (n = 8), healthcare workers (n = 4), and members of Non-Governmental Organizations and religious foundations focused on working with refugees and asylum seekers in Chile (n = 2). Results Although Chilean law guarantees access to all levels of healthcare for the international migrant population, the specific healthcare needs of refugees and asylum seekers were not adequately covered. Primary care and mental healthcare were the most required types of service for participants, yet they appeared to be the most difficult to access. Difficulties in social integration -including access to healthcare, housing, and education- upon arrival and lengthy waiting times for legal status of refugees also presented great barriers to effective healthcare provision and wellbeing. Healthcare workers and members of organizations indicated the need for more information about refugee and asylum-seeking populations, their rights and conditions, as well as more effective and tailored healthcare interventions for them, especially for emergency mental healthcare situations. Conclusions All participants perceived that there was disinformation among institutional actors regarding the healthcare needs of refugees and asylum seekers in Chile. They also perceived that there were barriers to access to primary care and mental healthcare, which might lead to overuse of emergency services. This study highlights a sense of urgency to protect the social and healthcare needs of refugees and asylum seekers in Latin America."

https://openalex.org/W3096696863,"Introduction Interfacility transfers may reflect a time delay of definitive surgical care, but few studies have examined the prevalence of interfacility transfers in the urban low- and middle-income (LMIC) setting. The aim of this study was to determine the number of interfacility transfers required for surgical and obstetric conditions in an urban MIC setting to better understand access to definitive surgical care among LMIC patients. Methods A retrospective analysis of public interfacility transfer records was conducted from April 2015 to April 2016 in Cali, Colombia. Data were obtained from the single municipal ambulance agency providing publicly funded ambulance transfers in the city. Interfacility transfers were defined as any patient transfer between two healthcare facilities. We identified the number of transfers for patients with surgical conditions and categorized transfers based on patient ICD-9-CM codes. We compared surgical transfers from public vs. private healthcare facilities by condition type (surgical, obstetric, nonsurgical), transferring physician specialty, and transfer acuity (code blue, emergent, urgent and nonurgent) using logistic regression. Results 31,659 patient transports occurred over the 13-month study period. 22250 (70.2%) of all transfers were interfacility transfers and 7777 (35%) of transfers were for patients with surgical conditions with an additional 2,244 (10.3%) for obstetric conditions. 49% (8660/17675) of interfacility transfers from public hospitals were for surgical and obstetric conditions vs 32% (1466/4580) for private facilities (P&lt;0.001). The most common surgical conditions requiring interfacility transfer were fractures (1,227, 5.4%), appendicitis (913, 4.1%), wounds (871, 3.9%), abdominal pain (818, 3.6%), trauma (652, 2.9%), and acute abdomen (271, 1.2%). Conclusion Surgical and obstetric conditions account for nearly half of all urban interfacility ambulance transfers. The most common reasons for transfer are basic surgical conditions with public healthcare facilities transferring a greater proportion of patient with surgical conditions than private facilities. Timely access to an initial healthcare facility may not be a reliable surrogate of definitive surgical care given the substantial need for interfacility transfers."
https://openalex.org/W3097591470,"Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) is one of the viruses that is most frequently associated with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD). Previous studies have shown that CV-A16 infections are mostly self-limiting, but in recent years, it has been gradually found that CV-A16 infections can also induce neurological complications and eventually cause death in children with HFMD. Moreover, no curative drugs or preventative vaccines have been developed for CV-A16 infection. Therefore, it is particularly important to investigate the mechanism of CV-A16 infection-induced neuropathy. In the current study, transcriptome sequencing technology was used to identify changes in the transcriptome of SH-SY5Y cells infected with CV-A16, which might hide the mechanism of CV-A16-induced neuropathology. The transcriptome profiling showed that 82,406,974, 108,652,260 and 97,753,565 clean reads were obtained in the Control, CV-A16-12 h and CV-A16-24 h groups, respectively. And it was further detected that a total of 136 and 161 differentially expressed genes in CV-A16-12 h and CV-A16-24 h groups, respectively, when compared with Control group. Then, to explore the mechanism of CV-A16 infection, we focused on the common differentially expressed genes at different time points of CV-A16 infection and found that there were 34 differentially expressed genes based on which clustering analysis and functional category enrichment analysis were performed. The results indicated that changes in oxidation levels were particularly evident in the GO term analysis, while only the “Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor pathway” was enriched in the KEGG pathway analysis, which might be closely related to the neurotoxicity caused by CV-A16 infection. Meanwhile, the ID2 closely related to nervous system has been demonstrated to be increased during CV-A16 infection. Additionally, the data on differentially expressed non-protein-coding genes of different types within the transcriptome sequencing results were analyzed, and it was speculated that these dysregulated non-protein-coding genes played a pivotal role in CV-A16 infection. Ultimately, qRT-PCR was utilized to validate the transcriptome sequencing findings, and the results of qRT-PCR were in agreement with the transcriptome sequencing data. In conclusion, transcriptome profiling was carried out to analyze response of SH-SY5Y cells to CV-A16 infection. And our findings provide important information to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms which were linked to the neuropathogenesis of CV-A16 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3097840556,"Multiple factors contribute to gestational duration variability. Understanding the sources of variability allows to design better association studies and assess public health measures. Here, we aimed to assess geographical and temporal changes in the determination of gestational duration and its reporting in Sweden between 1973 and 2012. Singleton live births between 1973 and 2012 were retrieved from the Swedish Medical Birth Register. Gestational duration trends in percentiles and rates of pre- and post-term deliveries were analyzed by plotting the values over time. Temporal changes in gestational duration based on ultrasound and last menstrual period (LMP) estimation methods were compared. Intervals between LMP date and LMP-based due date were analyzed to assess changes in expected gestational duration. In total, 3 940 577 pregnancies were included. From 1973 until 1985, the median of gestational duration estimated based on LMP or ultrasound decreased from 283 to 278 days, and remained stable until 2012. The distribution was relatively stable when ultrasound-based estimates were used. Until the mid-1990s, there was a higher incidence than expected of births occurring on every seventh gestational day from day 157 onward. On an average, these gestational durations were reported 1.8 times more often than adjacent durations. Until 1989, the most common expected gestational duration was 280 days, and thereafter, it was 279 days. The expected gestational duration varied from 279 to 281 days across different Swedish counties. During leap years, the expected gestational duration was one day longer. Consequently, leap years were also associated with significantly higher preterm and lower post-term delivery rates than non-leap years. Changes in data handling and obstetrical practices over the years contribute to gestational duration variation. The resulting increase in variability might reduce precision in association studies and hamper the assessment of public health measures aimed to improve pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3095800058,"Background This study aimed to explain the dynamics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients with prostate cancer who were treated with carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) and neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Methods Eighty-five patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer who received CIRT and neoadjuvant ADT from December 2015 to December 2017 were analyzed in the present study. The total dose of CIRT was set at 51.6 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) delivered in 12 fractions over 3 weeks. The PSA bounce was defined as a ≥0.4 ng/ml increase of PSA levels from the nadir, followed by any decrease. PSA failure was defined using the Phoenix criteria. Results The median patient age was 68 (range, 48–81) years. The median follow-up duration was 33 (range, 20–48) months. The clinical T stage was T1c, T2a, and T2b in 27, 44, and 14 patients, respectively. The Gleason score was 6 in 3 patients and 7 in 82 patients. The median pretreatment PSA level was 7.37 (range, 3.33–19.0) ng/ml. All patients received neoadjuvant ADT for a median of 6 (range, 2–117) months. PSA bounces were observed in 39 patients (45.9%), occurring a median of 12 (range, 6–30) months after CIRT. PSA failure was observed in eight patients (9.4%), occurring a median of 21 (range, 15–33) months after CIRT. The 3-year PSA failure-free survival rate was 88.5%. No clinical recurrence was observed during the follow-up period. Younger age and lower T stage were significant predictors of PSA bounce. Younger age was a significant predictor of PSA failure. Conclusions In this study, we identified the significant predictors of the occurrence of PSA bounce and failure. Further follow-up is needed to reveal the clinical significance of PSA dynamics."
