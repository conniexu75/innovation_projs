https://openalex.org/W1985159685,"A kinetic mathematical model of crystal growth from the melt is used to describe quantitatively the phenomenon of oscillatory zoning in plagioclase feldspar. In this model, the functional dependence of crystal growth rate on both melt and crystal surface composition and the transport of material within the melt are explicitly considered. Oscillatory zoning is found to develop for a wide variety of such functional dependence and to be sensitive to the initial composition of the melt."
https://openalex.org/W2000867488,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens incites crown gall tumors when bacterial DNA integrates into plant nuclear DNA. Plant cells can express these integrated bacterial genes. Following insertion of desired genes into bacterial DNA using recombinant DNA techniques, this system permits introduction of these new genes into plant DNA. We discuss the potential for genetic manipulation of plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the related organism Agrobacterium rhizogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2076979502,"Mirror-imaged doublets of the hypotrich ciliate Pleurotricha lanceolata were induced and analyzed with respect to the overall patterning (structural asymmetry and polarity) of the individual components of the ciliature. The overall pattern is arranged as a mirror image, but the individual components in the two halves of the doublet show the same organizational asymmetry. These data demonstrate the independence of the mechanisms for this kind of large-scale (global) patterning and control of assembly of the individual ciliary components."

However, these successes were won under generally favorable conditions of soil, climate, and irrigation water availability. The challenge of the future is to broaden the base of increased food production to include areas less well endowed with natural and economic resources. Chemistry and chemicals must play vital roles in this venture. Innovative chemical and biochemical approaches must be called upon to produce crop varieties, animal strains, and associated technologies to overcome constraints such as insects and diseases, acid and alkaline soils, and drought conditions. Genetic engineering will probably be a primary mechanism to achieve this goal."
https://openalex.org/W1975279996,Estimates based on potential maize crops and maize consumption patterns of the 15th-century Mesoamerican protohistoric Tarascan population living within its geopolitical core (Lake PÃ¡ttzcuaro Basin) indicate that this population had not maintained itself through agricultural- and lacustrine-carrying capacity alone. It was through having to obtain basic resources such as maize from outside the basin that the Tarascans developed mechanisms that formed the particular character of their state.

https://openalex.org/W2083316080,"The internal fine structure of crustacean compound eyes has been reexamined with scanning electron microscopy. Several different preparative techniques were used in a comparative study of crab, crayfish, shrimp, and stomatopod eyes. The three-dimensional pattern of photoreceptive, dioptric, and screening components of these eyes has been directly demonstrated, and new insight has been gained into their functional organization. Particularly interesting in apposition eyes is the elaborate array of boundary membranes and protoplasmic strands linking the photoreceptive microvilli to their parent cell cytoplasm across the large intracellular vacuoles surrounding the axial rhabdom. Quantitative application of scanning electron microscopy to this system promises to advance our understanding of its proven high rate of receptor membrane turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2066353447,Saturn's E ring is revealed by image processing of direct photographs of the 1966 edge-on presentation of the planet's ring plane. Two different techniques were used: scanning with an image quantizer operated in the derivative mode and computer-enhanced background subtraction from digitized images.

https://openalex.org/W1976551990,"A group of academic and industrial energy specialists met recently to discuss options for the United States in the event of an oil cutoff. The present rate of filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was seen as symbolic, with little practical value except as a means of buying a little time. The government's gasoline rationing plan was viewed as simply unworkable, as stated by one of the participants. Instead of the defensive plans characterized by reserves and rationing, the participants endorsed several proposals for quickly increasing energy supplies. These proposals include a relaxation of environmental laws, faster decontrol of oil and gas prices, and accelerated building of coal and nuclear electric plants. (SAC)"

https://openalex.org/W2004850272,"The selection of sites to store high-level radioactive waste will require more than technical decisions; an acceptable site must gain widespread public support. Ad hoc approaches have recently served as a stimulus to overcome institutional inertia in radioactive waste management, as exemplified by the Interagency Review Group and the State Planning Council for Radioactive Waste Management, but ad hoc approaches have not characteristically succeeded in resolving intense conflicts. Acceptable sites can best be established through traditional processes of legal and scientific advocacy, and their ultimate legitimacy will depend on the proper use of established democratic processes."
