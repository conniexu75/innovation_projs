Curative strategies that target the reservoir are being tested4,5 and require accurate, scalable reservoir assays. The reservoir was defined with quantitative viral outgrowth assays for cells that release infectious virus after one round of T cell activation1. However, these quantitative outgrowth assays and newer assays for cells that produce viral RNA after activation6 may underestimate the reservoir size because one round of activation does not induce all proviruses7. Many studies rely on simple assays based on polymerase chain reaction to detect proviral DNA regardless of transcriptional status, but the clinical relevance of these assays is unclear, as the vast majority of proviruses are defective7–9. Here we describe a more accurate method of measuring the HIV-1 reservoir that separately quantifies intact and defective proviruses. We show that the dynamics of cells that carry intact and defective proviruses are different in vitro and in vivo. These findings have implications for targeting the intact proviruses that are a barrier to curing HIV infection. An assay to measure the latent HIV-1 reservoir that separately quantifies intact and defective proviruses will facilitate evaluation of HIV-1 cure strategies by measuring the provirues that pose a barrier to cure."

https://openalex.org/W2912761389,"Environmental genotoxic factors pose a challenge to the genomic integrity of epithelial cells at barrier surfaces that separate host organisms from the environment. They can induce mutations that, if they occur in epithelial stem cells, contribute to malignant transformation and cancer development1–3. Genome integrity in epithelial stem cells is maintained by an evolutionarily conserved cellular response pathway, the DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR culminates in either transient cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair or elimination of damaged cells by apoptosis4,5. Here we show that the cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22), produced by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and γδ T cells, is an important regulator of the DDR machinery in intestinal epithelial stem cells. Using a new mouse model that enables sporadic inactivation of the IL-22 receptor in colon epithelial stem cells, we demonstrate that IL-22 is required for effective initiation of the DDR following DNA damage. Stem cells deprived of IL-22 signals and exposed to carcinogens escaped DDR-controlled apoptosis, contained more mutations and were more likely to give rise to colon cancer. We identified metabolites of glucosinolates, a group of phytochemicals contained in cruciferous vegetables, to be a widespread source of genotoxic stress in intestinal epithelial cells. These metabolites are ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)6, and AhR-mediated signalling in ILC3 and γδ T cells controlled their production of IL-22. Mice fed with diets depleted of glucosinolates produced only very low levels of IL-22 and, consequently, the DDR in epithelial cells of mice on a glucosinolate-free diet was impaired. This work identifies a homeostatic network protecting stem cells against challenge to their genome integrity by AhR-mediated ‘sensing’ of genotoxic compounds from the diet. AhR signalling, in turn, ensures on-demand production of IL-22 by innate lymphocytes directly regulating components of the DDR in epithelial stem cells. Sporadic inactivation of the interleukin-22 receptor in the intestinal epithelium of the mouse shows that IL-22 is required for effective activation of the DNA damage response following DNA damage."

https://openalex.org/W2912671957,"Fibroblasts are polymorphic cells with pleiotropic roles in organ morphogenesis, tissue homeostasis and immune responses. In fibrotic diseases, fibroblasts synthesize abundant amounts of extracellular matrix, which induces scarring and organ failure. By contrast, a hallmark feature of fibroblasts in arthritis is degradation of the extracellular matrix because of the release of metalloproteinases and degrading enzymes, and subsequent tissue destruction. The mechanisms that drive these functionally opposing pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory phenotypes of fibroblasts remain unknown. Here we identify the transcription factor PU.1 as an essential regulator of the pro-fibrotic gene expression program. The interplay between transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that normally control the expression of PU.1 expression is perturbed in various fibrotic diseases, resulting in the upregulation of PU.1, induction of fibrosis-associated gene sets and a phenotypic switch in extracellular matrix-producing pro-fibrotic fibroblasts. By contrast, pharmacological and genetic inactivation of PU.1 disrupts the fibrotic network and enables reprogramming of fibrotic fibroblasts into resting fibroblasts, leading to regression of fibrosis in several organs. The transcription factor PU.1 is an essential regulator of the pro-fibrotic gene expression program in fibroblasts; PU.1 expression is upregulated in various fibrotic diseases, whereas inactivation of PU.1 induces regression of fibrosis in a number of organs."
https://openalex.org/W2952000543,"Whether post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression controls differentiation of stem cells for tissue renewal remains unknown. Quiescent stem cells exhibit a low level of protein synthesis1, which is key to maintaining the pool of fully functional stem cells, not only in the brain but also in the bone marrow and hair follicles2-6. Neurons also maintain a subset of messenger RNAs in a translationally silent state, which react 'on demand' to intracellular and extracellular signals. This uncoupling of general availability of mRNA from translation into protein facilitates immediate responses to environmental changes and avoids excess production of proteins, which is the most energy-consuming process within the cell. However, when post-transcriptional regulation is acquired and how protein synthesis changes along the different steps of maturation are not known. Here we show that protein synthesis undergoes highly dynamic changes when stem cells differentiate to neurons in vivo. Examination of individual transcripts using RiboTag mouse models reveals that whereas stem cells translate abundant transcripts with little discrimination, translation becomes increasingly regulated with the onset of differentiation. The generation of neurogenic progeny involves translational repression of a subset of mRNAs, including mRNAs that encode the stem cell identity factors SOX2 and PAX6, and components of the translation machinery, which are enriched in a pyrimidine-rich motif. The decrease of mTORC1 activity as stem cells exit the cell cycle selectively blocks translation of these transcripts. Our results reveal a control mechanism by which the cell cycle is coupled to post-transcriptional repression of key stem cell identity factors, thereby promoting exit from stemness."
https://openalex.org/W2912684103,"The biochemical response to food intake must be precisely regulated. Because ingested sugars and fats can feed into many anabolic and catabolic pathways1, how our bodies handle nutrients depends on strategically positioned metabolic sensors that link the intrinsic nutritional value of a meal with intermediary metabolism. Here we describe a subset of immune cells-integrin β7+ natural gut intraepithelial T lymphocytes (natural IELs)-that is dispersed throughout the enterocyte layer of the small intestine and that modulates systemic metabolism. Integrin β7- mice that lack natural IELs are metabolically hyperactive and, when fed a high-fat and high-sugar diet, are resistant to obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, we show that protection from cardiovascular disease in the absence of natural IELs depends on the enteroendocrine-derived incretin GLP-12, which is normally controlled by IELs through expression of the GLP-1 receptor. In this metabolic control system, IELs modulate enteroendocrine activity by acting as gatekeepers that limit the bioavailability of GLP-1. Although the function of IELs may prove advantageous when food is scarce, present-day overabundance of diets high in fat and sugar renders this metabolic checkpoint detrimental to health."
https://openalex.org/W2911973964,"Tubular epithelia are a basic building block of organs and a common site of cancer occurrence1-4. During tumorigenesis, transformed cells overproliferate and epithelial architecture is disrupted. However, the biophysical parameters that underlie the adoption of abnormal tumour tissue shapes are unknown. Here we show in the pancreas of mice that the morphology of epithelial tumours is determined by the interplay of cytoskeletal changes in transformed cells and the existing tubular geometry. To analyse the morphological changes in tissue architecture during the initiation of cancer, we developed a three-dimensional whole-organ imaging technique that enables tissue analysis at single-cell resolution. Oncogenic transformation of pancreatic ducts led to two types of neoplastic growth: exophytic lesions that expanded outwards from the duct and endophytic lesions that grew inwards to the ductal lumen. Myosin activity was higher apically than basally in wild-type cells, but upon transformation this gradient was lost in both lesion types. Three-dimensional vertex model simulations and a continuum theory of epithelial mechanics, which incorporate the cytoskeletal changes observed in transformed cells, indicated that the diameter of the source epithelium instructs the morphology of growing tumours. Three-dimensional imaging revealed that-consistent with theory predictions-small pancreatic ducts produced exophytic growth, whereas large ducts deformed endophytically. Similar patterns of lesion growth were observed in tubular epithelia of the liver and lung; this finding identifies tension imbalance and tissue curvature as fundamental determinants of epithelial tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2914661502,"Focusing laser light onto a very small target can produce the conditions for laboratory-scale nuclear fusion of hydrogen isotopes. The lack of accurate predictive models, which are essential for the design of high-performance laser-fusion experiments, is a major obstacle to achieving thermonuclear ignition. Here we report a statistical approach that was used to design and quantitatively predict the results of implosions of solid deuterium–tritium targets carried out with the 30-kilojoule OMEGA laser system, leading to tripling of the fusion yield to its highest value so far for direct-drive laser fusion. When scaled to the laser energies of the National Ignition Facility (1.9 megajoules), these targets are predicted to produce a fusion energy output of about 500 kilojoules—several times larger than the fusion yields currently achieved at that facility. This approach could guide the exploration of the vast parameter space of thermonuclear ignition conditions and enhance our understanding of laser-fusion physics. A statistical approach to designing and predicting the fusion yield of cryogenic deuterium–tritium implosions leads to tripled yield in direct-drive laser fusion of deuterium–tritium layered targets."
https://openalex.org/W2911574805,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) coordinates regulation of growth, metabolism, protein synthesis and autophagy1. Its hyperactivation contributes to disease in numerous organs, including the heart1,2, although broad inhibition of mTORC1 risks interference with its homeostatic roles. Tuberin (TSC2) is a GTPase-activating protein and prominent intrinsic regulator of mTORC1 that acts through modulation of RHEB (Ras homologue enriched in brain). TSC2 constitutively inhibits mTORC1; however, this activity is modified by phosphorylation from multiple signalling kinases that in turn inhibits (AMPK and GSK-3β) or stimulates (AKT, ERK and RSK-1) mTORC1 activity3-9. Each kinase requires engagement of multiple serines, impeding analysis of their role in vivo. Here we show that phosphorylation or gain- or loss-of-function mutations at either of two adjacent serine residues in TSC2 (S1365 and S1366 in mice; S1364 and S1365 in humans) can bidirectionally control mTORC1 activity stimulated by growth factors or haemodynamic stress, and consequently modulate cell growth and autophagy. However, basal mTORC1 activity remains unchanged. In the heart, or in isolated cardiomyocytes or fibroblasts, protein kinase G1 (PKG1) phosphorylates these TSC2 sites. PKG1 is a primary effector of nitric oxide and natriuretic peptide signalling, and protects against heart disease10-13. Suppression of hypertrophy and stimulation of autophagy in cardiomyocytes by PKG1 requires TSC2 phosphorylation. Homozygous knock-in mice that express a phosphorylation-silencing mutation in TSC2 (TSC2(S1365A)) develop worse heart disease and have higher mortality after sustained pressure overload of the heart, owing to mTORC1 hyperactivity that cannot be rescued by PKG1 stimulation. However, cardiac disease is reduced and survival of heterozygote Tsc2S1365A knock-in mice subjected to the same stress is improved by PKG1 activation or expression of a phosphorylation-mimicking mutation (TSC2(S1365E)). Resting mTORC1 activity is not altered in either knock-in model. Therefore, TSC2 phosphorylation is both required and sufficient for PKG1-mediated cardiac protection against pressure overload. The serine residues identified here provide a genetic tool for bidirectional regulation of the amplitude of stress-stimulated mTORC1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2912324706,"Sphingolipids compose a lipid family critical for membrane structure as well as intra- and intercellular signaling. De novo sphingolipid biosynthesis is initiated by the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. In both yeast and mammalian species, SPT activity is homeostatically regulated through small ER membrane proteins, the Orms in yeast and the ORMDLs in mammalian cells. These proteins form stable complexes with SPT. In yeast, the homeostatic regulation of SPT relies, at least in part, on phosphorylation of the Orms. However, this does not appear to be the case for the mammalian ORMDLs. Here, we accomplished a cell-free reconstitution of the sphingolipid regulation of the ORMDL–SPT complex to probe the underlying regulatory mechanism. Sphingolipid and ORMDL-dependent regulation of SPT was demonstrated in isolated membranes, essentially free of cytosol. This suggests that this regulation does not require soluble cytosolic proteins or small molecules such as ATP. We found that this system is particularly responsive to the pro-apoptotic sphingolipid ceramide and that this response is strictly stereospecific, indicating that ceramide regulates the ORMDL–SPT complex via a specific binding interaction. Yeast membranes harboring the Orm–SPT system also directly responded to sphingolipid, suggesting that yeast cells have, in addition to Orm phosphorylation, an additional Orm-dependent SPT regulatory mechanism. Our results indicate that ORMDL/Orm-mediated regulation of SPT involves a direct interaction of sphingolipid with the membrane-bound components of the SPT-regulatory apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2913439423,"We previously showed that NADPH oxidase organizer 1 (Noxo1), a component of NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), is a TNF-α-induced tumor-promoting factor in gastric tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism of NOX1-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling for the gastric tumorigenesis has not been understood. Here, we showed that expression of NOX1 complex components, including Noxo1, but not other NOX family members was significantly upregulated in both mouse models for gastritis and gastric tumors, which was associated with increased ROS levels. We also found that NF-κB directly regulated NOXO1 expression in TNF-α-stimulated gastric cancer cells, suggesting that inflammation induces NOX1 complex activation through TNF-α/NF-κB pathway. Notably, in situ hybridization indicated that Noxo1 mRNA was detected in proliferating cells of gastritis and gastric tumors, and pharmacological inhibition of NOX activity significantly suppressed the proliferation of MKN45 gastric cancer cells and gastric hyperplasia of K19-C2mE mice. These results suggest that NOX1/ROS signaling has an important role in increased proliferation of stomach epithelial cells in the inflamed mucosa. Moreover, we found that expression of SOX2, a marker of gastric epithelial stem cells, was increased by NOX1/ROS signaling. Furthermore, disruption of Noxo1 in K19-C2mE mice significantly suppressed gastritis-associated metaplastic hyperplasia, a potent preneoplastic lesion, which was associated with decreased number of SOX2-positive cells. These results indicate that inflammation-induced Noxo1 expression is responsible for development of metaplastic hyperplasia in the stomach through an increase in SOX2-expressing undifferentiated epithelial cells. Therefore, inhibition of the NOX1/ROS signaling pathway is a possible strategy for prevention and therapy for gastric cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2914927848,"Purpose There is physiological and biomechanical evidence suggesting a possible advantage of using poles in walking training programs. The purpose of this proof-of-concept study was to test the hypothesis that untrained elderly training Nordic walking for eight weeks will show higher improvements on the functional mobility, quality of life and postural balance than that training without poles; more likely to occur in self-selected walking speed (primary outcome), and the locomotor rehabilitation index than the quality of life, the static balance and the dynamic stability. It was a two-arm randomized sample- and load-controlled study. Methods Thirty-three untrained older people were randomly assigned into Nordic walking (n = 16, age: 64.6±4.1 years old) and free walking (n = 17, age: 68.6±3.9 years old) training groups. Results Improvements in the self-selected walking speed (primary outcome, p = 0.011, ES = 0.42 95%CI -0.31 to 1.16), locomotor rehabilitation index (p = 0.013, ES = 0.36; (95%CI -0.39 to 1.10), quality of life (p<0.05), static balance (p<0.05) and dynamic variability (p<0.05) were found in both groups. Conclusions The hypothesis was not supported, our findings indicated that after 8 weeks, the Nordic walking training did not result in greater improvements than free walking training for the primary outcome (self-selected walking speed) and most of the secondary outcomes (including locomotor rehabilitation index, static balance, dynamic stability, and psychological and social participation domains of quality of life).

https://openalex.org/W2911304434,"Bone fracture healing is a complex, dynamic process that involves various cell types, with osteoclasts and osteoblasts playing indispensable roles. In this study, we found that psoralen, the main active ingredient in Psoralea corylifolia L. fruit extract, enhanced bone fracture healing through activation of osteoclast and osteoblast activity via the ERK signaling pathway. In detail, psoralen promoted receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand-induced osteoclastogenesis, mRNA expression of osteoclast-specific genes, and osteoclastic bone resorption in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages. Meanwhile, psoralen induced osteogenic differentiation by promoting the mRNA expression of the osteoblast differentiation markers alkaline phosphatase, runt-related transcription factor 2, osterix, and osteocalcin. At the molecular level, psoralen preferentially activated ERK1/2 but not JNK or p38 MAPKs. Further experiments revealed that psoralen-induced osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation was abrogated by a specific inhibitor of phosphorylated ERK. In addition, psoralen accelerated bone fracture healing in a rat tibial fracture model, and the numbers of osteoclasts and osteoblasts were increased in psoralen-treated fracture callus. Taken together, our findings indicate that psoralen accelerates bone fracture healing through activation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts via ERK signaling and has potential as a novel drug in the orthopedic clinic for the treatment of bone fractures.—Zhang, T., Han, W., Zhao, K., Yang, W., Lu, X., Jia, Y., Qin, A., Qian, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2914579308,"β-Cell mitochondria play a central role in coupling glucose metabolism with insulin secretion. Here, we identified a metabolic function of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B1—the activation of mitochondrial respiratory complex I—that is active in quiescent adult β-cells and hyperactive in β-cells from obese (ob/ob) mice. In WT islets, respirometry revealed that 65% of complex I flux and 49% of state 3 respiration is sensitive to CDK1 inhibition. Islets from ob/ob mice expressed more cyclin B1 and exhibited a higher sensitivity to CDK1 blockade, which reduced complex I flux by 76% and state 3 respiration by 79%. The ensuing reduction in mitochondrial NADH utilization, measured with two-photon NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), was matched in the cytosol by a lag in citrate cycling, as shown with a FRET reporter targeted to β-cells. Moreover, time-resolved measurements revealed that in ob/ob islets, where complex I flux dominates respiration, CDK1 inhibition is sufficient to restrict the duty cycle of ATP/ADP and calcium oscillations, the parameter that dynamically encodes β-cell glucose sensing. Direct complex I inhibition with rotenone mimicked the restrictive effects of CDK1 inhibition on mitochondrial respiration, NADH turnover, ATP/ADP, and calcium influx. These findings identify complex I as a critical mediator of obesity-associated metabolic remodeling in β-cells and implicate CDK1 as a regulator of complex I that enhances β-cell glucose sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2912835993,"Interpreting discourses among implementers of what is termed a “landscape approach” enables us to learn from their experience to improve conservation and development outcomes. We use Q-methodology to explore the perspectives of a group of experts in the landscape approach, both from academic and implementation fields, on what hinderances are in place to the realisation of achieving sustainable landscape management in Indonesia. The results show that, at a generic level, “corruption” and “lack of transparency and accountability” rank as the greatest constraints on landscape functionality. Biophysical factors, such as topography and climate change, rank as the least constraining factors. When participants considered a landscape with which they were most familiar, the results changed: the rapid change of regulations, limited local human capacity and inaccessible data on economic risks increased, while the inadequacy of democratic institutions, “overlapping laws” and “corruption” decreased. The difference indicates some fine-tuning of generic perceptions to the local context and may also reflect different views on what is achievable for landscape approach practitioners. Overall, approximately 55% of variance is accounted for by five discourse factors for each trial. Four overlapped and two discourses were discrete enough to merit different discourse labels. We labelled the discourses (1) social exclusionists, (2) state view, (3) community view, (4) integrationists, (5) democrats, and (6) neoliberals. Each discourse contains elements actionable at the landscape scale, as well as exogenous issues that originate at national and global scales. Actionable elements that could contribute to improving governance included trust building, clarified resource rights and responsibilities, and inclusive representation in management. The landscape sustainability discourses studied here suggests that landscape approach “learners” must focus on ways to remedy poor governance if they are to achieve sustainability and multi-functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2914436737,"Cystoseira is a common brown algal genus widely distributed throughout the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions whose taxonomical assignment of specimens is often hampered by intra- and interspecific morphological variability. In this study, three mitochondrial regions, namely cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI), 23S rDNA (23S), and 23S-tRNAVal intergenic spacer (mt-spacer) were used to analyse the phylogenetic relationships of 22 Cystoseira taxa (n = 93 samples). A total of 135 sequences (48 from COI, 43 from 23S and 44 from mt-spacer) were newly generated and analysed together with Cystoseira sequences (9 COI, 31 23S and 35 mt-spacer) from other authors. Phylogenetic analysis of these three markers identified 3 well-resolved clades and also corroborated the polyphyletic nature of the genus. The resolution of Cystoseira taxa within the three clades improves significantly when the inclusion of specimens of related genera was minimized. COI and mt-spacer markers resolved the phylogeny of some of the Cystoseira taxa, such as the C. baccata, C. foeniculacea and C. usneoides. Furthermore, trends between phylogeny, embryonic development and available chemotaxonomic classifications were identified, showing that phylogenetic, chemical and morphological data should be taken into account to study the evolutionary relationships among the algae currently classified as Cystoseira. The resolution of Cystoseira macroalgae into three well supported clades achieved here is relevant for a more accurate isolation and identification of natural compounds and the implementation of conservation measures for target species."
https://openalex.org/W2911704378,"Genetic instability, a heritable increase in the rate of genetic mutation, accelerates evolutionary adaptation1 and is widespread in cancer2,3. In mammals, instability can arise from damage to both copies of genes involved in DNA metabolism and cell cycle regulation4 or from inactivation of one copy of a gene whose product is present in limiting amounts (haploinsufficiency5); however, it has proved difficult to determine the relative importance of these two mechanisms. In Escherichia coli6, the application of repeated, strong selection enriches for genetic instability. Here we have used this approach to evolve genetic instability in diploid cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and have isolated clones with increased rates of point mutation, mitotic recombination, and chromosome loss. We identified candidate, heterozygous, instability-causing mutations; engineering these mutations, as heterozygotes, into the ancestral diploid strain caused genetic instability. Mutations that inactivated one copy of haploinsufficient genes were more common than those that dominantly altered the function of the mutated gene copy. The mutated genes were enriched for genes functioning in transport, protein quality control, and DNA metabolism, and have revealed new targets for genetic instability7–11, including essential genes. Although only a minority (10 out of 57 genes with orthologues or close homologues) of the targets we identified have homologous human genes that have been implicated in cancer2, the remainder are candidates to contribute to human genetic instability. To test this hypothesis, we inactivated six examples in a near-haploid human cell line; five of these mutations increased instability. We conclude that single genetic events cause genetic instability in diploid yeast cells, and propose that similar, heterozygous mutations in mammalian homologues initiate genetic instability in cancer. Repeated selection for adaptive mutations in a diploid yeast model results in increased genetic instability and sheds light on mechanisms of genetic instability that might contribute to tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2913539523,"Infertility has been a great challenge in reproductive medicine. At least 40% of human pregnancy losses are clinically unrecognized and occur because of embryo implantation failure. Identification of the proteins and biochemical factors involved in embryo implantation and that are essential for crosstalk between the embryo and uterus can further increase female fertility rates. The actin cytoskeleton and actin-binding proteins (ABPs) are of great importance for cell morphology and rearrangement, which is crucial for trophoblast adhesion and invasion. However, the research on ABPs in embryo implantation is insufficient. In this report, we found that transgelin (TAGLN)2 is highly expressed in mouse blastocyst trophoblasts. Notably, inhibition of mouse blastocyst trophoblast TAGLN2 by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference significantly impaired embryo adhesion and implantation ability. Further in vitro experiments demonstrated that TAGLN2 knockdown with small interfering RNA observably decreased the invasion and migration abilities of human trophoblast cells. Immunofluorescence colocalization and microscale thermophoresis analysis showed that TAGLN2 directly binds to actin. In addition, knockdown of TAGLN2 in trophoblast cells resulted in a remarkable reduction in F-actin rather than G-actin.

Mobile phones are emerging as a tool for rapid, cost effective data collection at scale in Africa, as mobile phone subscriptions and phone ownership increase at the highest rates globally. To assess the feasibility and biases of collecting nutrition data via computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) to mobile phones, we measured Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) and Minimum Acceptable Diet for Infants and Young Children (MAD) using a one-week test-retest study on 1,821 households in Kenya. Accuracy and bias were assessed by comparing individual scores and population prevalence of undernutrition collected via CATI with data collected via traditional face-to-face (F2F) surveys. We were able to reach 75% (n = 1366) of study participants via CATI. Women's reported nutrition scores did not change with mode for MDD-W, but children's nutrition scores were significantly higher when measured via CATI for both the dietary diversity (mean increase of 0.45 food groups, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.56) and meal frequency (mean increase of 0.75 meals per day, 95% confidence interval 0.53-0.96) components of MAD. This resulted in a 17% higher inferred prevalence of adequate diets for infants and young children via CATI. Women without mobile-phone access were younger and had fewer assets than women with access, but only marginally lower dietary diversity, resulting in a small non-coverage bias of 1-7% due to exclusion of participants without mobile phones. Thus, collecting nutrition data from rural women in Africa with mobile phones may result in 0% (no change) to as much as 25% higher nutrition estimates than collecting that information in face-to-face interviews."
https://openalex.org/W2911818284,"The signaling pathways that are mediated by Slit ligands and their Roundabout (Robo) family of receptors play multifunctional roles in the development of the nervous system and other organs. A recent study identified neural epidermal growth factor–like (NEL)–like 2 (NELL2) as a novel ligand for Robo3. In this study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1 and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for NELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the fourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can influence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1/2. Acidic conditions increased the binding affinity of Robo2 for NELL1. These results suggest that Robo2 functions as a receptor for NELL1/2, particularly under circumstances where Robo2 undergoes proteolytic digestion.

In this study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1 and the Robo family of receptors and demonstrated that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for both NELL1 and NELL2. NELL1/2 binds to the first fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain of Robo2 but not to intact Robo2. Mutation analysis revealed that several amino acids within the first FNIII domain are critical for NELL1 binding to Robo2 but not to Robo1. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the fourth immunoglobulin domain and single amino acid substitution mutants that can influence the architecture of the ectodomain facilitated binding to NELL1/2. Acidic conditions increased the binding affinity of Robo2 for NELL1. These results suggest that Robo2 functions as a receptor for NELL1/2, particularly under circumstances where Robo2 undergoes proteolytic digestion. If this is not the case, conformational changes of the ectodomain of Robo2 may unmask the binding site for NELL1/2.

The extracellular domain of Robo1–3 contains five Ig and three fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, whereas Robo4 has only two Ig and two FNIII domains. Robo receptors and their Slit ligands (Slit1–3), which were originally identified as important axon guidance molecules, have also been shown to function in a number of developmental events outside the nervous system (19Ypsilanti A.R. Zagar Y. Chédotal A.

Recently, NELL2 was identified as a secreted ligand for Robo3, thereby functioning as a repulsive axon guidance cue that contributes to commissural axon guidance to the midline (21Jaworski A. Tom I. Tong R.K. Gildea H.K. Koch A.W. Gonzalez L.C. Tessier-Lavigne M. Operational redundancy in axon guidance through the multifunctional receptor Robo3 and its ligand NELL2.Science. 2015; 350 (26586761): 961-96510.1126/science.aad2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although Robo3 binds both NELL1 and NELL2, NELL1 has no effect on commissural axon repulsion. These findings raise questions as to why NELL1 and NELL2 have different effects on commissural axon guidance following interaction with Robo3 and whether Robo3 is an exclusive receptor for NELL1 among the Robo family of receptors. In the present study, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between NELL1 and the Robo family of receptors in both cell-free and cell-based binding assays. We found that the FNIII domains of Robo2 have strong binding activity to both NELL1 and NELL2. Robo2 binds to the second and the third EGFL repeats of NELL1 through its first FNIII domain, and the critical amino acids for NELL1 binding were identified within the FNIII domain. The Robo2 deletion mutants without the fourth Ig domain and under acidic conditions facilitated binding to NELL1/2. These results raise the possibility that NELL1/2 interacts with Robo2, particularly under conditions where Robo2 undergoes proteolytic digestion or in an acidic environment. To investigate whether NELL1 binds to proteins of the Robo family (Fig. 1A), we first performed binding assays in solution using FLAG-tagged NELL1 and the HA-tagged extracellular domain (ECD) of Robo1–4. As shown in Fig. 1B, Robo3-ECD co-immunoprecipitated with full-length NELL1, which is consistent with a previous report (21Jaworski A. Tom I. Tong R.K. Gildea H.K. Koch A.W. Gonzalez L.C. Tessier-Lavigne M. Operational redundancy in axon guidance through the multifunctional receptor Robo3 and its ligand NELL2.Science. 2015; 350 (26586761): 961-96510.1126/science.aad2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but other Robo proteins did not co-immunoprecipitate with NELL1. Because NELL2 binds to FNIII domains of Robo3 (21Jaworski A. Tom I. Tong R.K. Gildea H.K. Koch A.W. Gonzalez L.C. Tessier-Lavigne M. Operational redundancy in axon guidance through the multifunctional receptor Robo3 and its ligand NELL2.Science. 2015; 350 (26586761): 961-96510.1126/science.aad2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we next performed solution-binding assays using the FNIII domains of Robo1–4 instead of the ECD. Interestingly, NELL1 bound not only to the FNIII domain of Robo3 but also strongly to that of Robo2 (Fig. 1C, left panel). Similar results were obtained using FLAG-tagged NELL2 (Fig. 1C, right panel). To confirm these results, solid-phase binding assays were performed using alkaline phosphatase (AP)–tagged NELL1 and Fc-tagged Robo1–4 in 96-well plates coated with protein A. AP-tagged NELL1, but not AP alone, bound to Fc-tagged Robo2-FNIII but not to Fc alone (Fig. S1). Further, AP-tagged NELL1 bound to Fc-Robo2 and -Robo3 in a similar manner to that observed in the solution-binding assays (Fig. 1, D and E, and Fig. S2). We performed cell-free binding assays using purified proteins to exclude the possibility that these results were because of indirect interactions mediated by other proteins present in conditioned media (Fig. S3). In the solid-phase binding assay, we used AP-tagged NELL1 containing only the C-terminal region because a sufficient amount of AP-tagged full-length NELL1 was not obtained because of a low expression level. Nevertheless, these assays demonstrated that NELL1 interacts with the FNIII domain of both Robo2 and Robo3. We also confirmed the interaction between NELL1 and the FNIII domain of Robo2 by biolayer interferometry (BLI) analysis (Fig. 1F and Fig. S4). These results suggested that Robo2 contains a cryptic binding site for NELL1/2 in FNIII domains. To determine which domain of Robo2 interacts with NELL1, deletion mutants of Fc-tagged Robo2-FNIII were prepared, and the binding activity was examined. The first FNIII domain (FNIII1) bound to NELL1, whereas the construct consisting of the second and third FNIII domains (FNIII23) did not bind, suggesting that Robo2 interacts with NELL1 through the first FNIII domain (Fig. 2, A and B, and Fig. S5). Similar results were obtained using the deletion mutants of Fc-tagged Robo3-FNIII (Fig. 2C). Conversely, to determine which domain of NELL1 interacts with Robo2, deletion mutants of AP-tagged NELL1 EGFL domains were prepared because NELL2 binds to Robo3 through the EGFL domains (21Jaworski A. Tom I. Tong R.K. Gildea H.K. Koch A.W. Gonzalez L.C. Tessier-Lavigne M. Operational redundancy in axon guidance through the multifunctional receptor Robo3 and its ligand NELL2.Science. 2015; 350 (26586761): 961-96510.1126/science.aad2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although the construct containing all six EGFL domains and constructs containing the sixth EGFL domain could not be examined because of difficulties with recombinant production, the construct consisting of the first three EGFL domains (EGFL123) was observed to interact with Robo2-FNIII, whereas the construct composed of EGFL domains three to five (EGFL345) did not bind (Fig. 2, A and D, and Fig. S5). Further, the construct consisting of the second and third EGFL domains (EGFL23) bound to Robo2-FNIII, whereas the construct consisting of the first and second EGFL domains (EGFL12) and the construct composed of the third EGFL domains (EGFL3) did not show binding, indicating that both the second and the third EGFL domains are required for interaction between NELL1 and Robo2. Amino acid sequence alignment of the first FNIII domain and linker region of mouse and human Robo1–3 shows very high homology among Robo members (51–61% identity and 71–80% similarity) (Fig. 3A), which enabled identification of potentially critical amino acids for NELL1 binding. Because NELL1 binds to the first FNIII domain of both Robo2 and Robo3, we focused on identifying amino acid residues that only differ between Robo1 and Robo2/3. Eight residues were found in the FNIII1 domain (Fig. 3A); however, we ignored Ser523 residue of mRobo1 (Gly523 of mRobo2) because it is located on the border of this domain. To investigate whether the remaining seven amino acid residues are involved in NELL1 binding, we prepared a series of mutant constructs of Fc-Robo2-FNIII in which the corresponding residues were substituted with those of Robo1 and tested the NELL1-binding activity of these mutants (Fig. 3B and Fig. S6). Because Var564 and Asn566 of mRobo2 are located close to each other, we prepared one construct with a double mutation (V564S and N566S). Among the five single mutants examined, the T581A mutant exhibited significant loss of NELL1-binding activity. Furthermore, a double or triple mutant containing the T581A mutation, such as T581A/T589A or V564S/N566S/T581A, showed complete loss of NELL1-binding activity. These results indicate that Thr581 plays a central role in NELL1 binding. A double mutant without the T581A mutation (T589A/P608Q) also exhibited significant loss of NELL1-binding activity, suggesting that several amino acids including Thr581 are responsible for NELL1 binding. We next prepared a series of mutant constructs of Fc-Robo1-FNIII where the corresponding residues were substituted with those of Robo2 and tested the NELL1-binding activity of these mutants (Fig. 3C and Fig. S6). Although a single mutant with the A581T mutation showed no significant induction, double to quintuple mutants exhibited 5–13-fold induction of NELL1-binding activity. These results reinforce the above suggestion that several amino acids including Thr581 of mRobo2 contribute to the NELL1 binding. A three-dimensional structure of the first FNIII domain of Robo2 was modeled using the crystal structure of the eighth FNIII domain of human sidekick 2 (Fig. S7A). Subsequently, the structural model of the T581A mutant was constructed based on the WT model. Analysis of the electrostatic surface potential of these homology-based structural models revealed that positively and negatively charged patches on the surface were absent in the T581A mutant probably because of conformational changes (Fig. S7, B and C), suggesting that NELL1 may interact with Robo2 through these charged patches. However, mutation of charged amino acids (Asp532 and Arg583) in these patches did not affect NELL1-binding activity (Fig. S7D), suggesting that another mechanism is involved in the reduction of NELL1-binding activity of the T581A mutant. To investigate whether NELL1 interacts with membrane-bound Robo2, COS1 cells were transiently transfected with the full-length Robo2 expression plasmid and its N-terminal deletion mutants (Fig. 4A and Fig. S8). The cells were incubated with AP-tagged NELL1, and bound NELL1 was assessed by in situ staining. Consistent with the results of the cell-free binding assays, AP-NELL1 showed moderate staining of cells expressing intact Robo3 but showed minimal staining of cells expressing intact Robo2 (Fig. 4B). However, when the first four Ig domains of Robo2 were deleted, AP-NELL1 showed significant staining. Similar results were obtained using AP-NELL2. These results suggest that the N-terminal Ig domains prevent NELL proteins from binding to the FNIII domain of Robo2. We prepared chimeric Robo2/3-ECD constructs by domain swapping between Ig domains and FNIII domains to investigate whether Ig domains of Robo2 have inhibitory properties on NELL1 binding. NELL1-binding activity in the solution-binding assay showed that both chimeric proteins were able to interact with NELL1 (Fig. 5), suggesting that NELL1 is not able to interact with intact Robo2 probably not because of the properties of the Ig domain, but because of the conformation of the entire extracellular domain structure. Interestingly, Ig domains of Robo2 bind to FNIII domains of Robo2 but not to those of Robo3 in the solid-phase binding assay (Fig. S9). This result suggests that Ig domains may mask the binding site for NELL1 by binding to FNIII domains (to be discussed later); however, the interaction between Ig domains and FNIII domains of Robo2 could not be detected in the solution-binding assay under our assay conditions (data not shown). Robo family members have been shown previously to interact homomerically and exist predominantly as homodimers (22Hivert B. Liu Z. Chuang C.-Y. Doherty P. Sundaresan V. Robo1 and Robo2 are homophilic binding molecules that promote axonal growth.Mol. Cell.

Roundabout 1 exists predominantly as a basal dimeric complex and this is unaffected by binding of the ligand Slit2.Biochem. J. 2014; 461 (24673457): 61-7310.1042/BJ20140190Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, the fourth Ig (Ig4) domain of Robo2 was identified as a dimerization domain (24Yom-Tov G. Barak R. Matalon O. Barda-Saad M. Guez-Haddad J. Opatowsky Y. Robo Ig4 is a dimerization domain.J. Mol.

NELL proteins did not bind to intact Robo2 and its deletion mutants containing the Ig4 domain (Fig. 4), prompting us to investigate whether the oligomeric state of Robo2 affects the interaction with NELL proteins. Thus, we prepared two single amino acid substitution mutants (F357R and L394R) where the hydrophobic core residues at the dimerization interface were substituted with arginine to reduce dimerization propensity (24Yom-Tov G. Barak R. Matalon O. Barda-Saad M. Guez-Haddad J. Opatowsky Y. Robo Ig4 is a dimerization domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 (29017837): 3606-361610.1016/j.jmb.2017.10.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and tested the binding activity to NELL1 in the cell-free binding assays. As shown in Fig. 6A, WT Robo2-ECD did not interact with NELL1, whereas F357R or L394R mutants of Robo2-ECD co-immunoprecipitated with NELL1 in the solution-binding assay. Similar results were obtained in the solid-phase binding assay (Fig. 6B and Fig. S10). To exclude the possibility that F357R and L394R mutants are prone to degradation and result in exposure of the binding site for NELL1, we confirmed these results by using purified proteins and verified the quality of the purified proteins by silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. S11). Fc-tagged Robo2-ECD proteins showed some degradation, but no such difference was observed between WT and mutants (Fig. S11C). We next determined the oligomeric state of the HA-tagged Robo2-ECD proteins by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), because the Fc tag itself mediates artificial dimerization. The SEC profile of the WT Robo2-ECD revealed that most of this protein exists as a dimer (Fig. S12A). Unexpectedly, the L394R mutant of Robo2-ECD also exists as a dimer (Fig. S12B), suggesting that either the F357R or L394R substitution did not affect the oligomeric state of the Robo2-ECD but may affect the conformation of Ig domains to expose the binding site for NELL1. We performed the solid-phase binding assay under acidic conditions to investigate whether low pH affects the NELL1-binding activity to the Robo2-ECD protein. As shown in Fig. 7A, the NELL1-binding activity increased as the pH decreased from 7.0 to 5.5, whereas the NELL1-binding activity to Robo2-FNIII did not change between pH 7.0 and 5.5 (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that acidic pH affects the conformation of the Ig domains but not the conformation of the FNIII domains. Similar to the Robo2-ECD, the NELL1-binding activity to the Robo3-ECD also increased as the pH decreased from 7.0 to 5.5 (Fig. 7C), indicating that Robo3-ECD has similar properties against acidic pH as Robo2-ECD. Acidic conditions also increased the NELL1-binding activity in cells expressing full-length Robo2 (Fig. 7D). We have investigated the binding activity of NELL1/2 to the Robo family of receptors using both cell-free and cell-based binding assays, and NELL1/2 was found to interact with not only intact Robo3 but also the Ig domain-deleted Robo2. Jaworski et al. (21Jaworski A. Tom I. Tong R.K. Gildea H.K. Koch A.W. Gonzalez L.C. Tessier-Lavigne M. Operational redundancy in axon guidance through the multifunctional receptor Robo3 and its ligand NELL2.Science. 2015; 350 (26586761): 961-96510.1126/science.aad2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Robo3 binds to both NELL1 and NELL2; however, NELL1 is not expressed in the spinal cord at the time of commissural axon growth to the midline and has no significant effect on commissural axon repulsion in vitro, suggesting that NELL1 is not a functional ligand for Robo3 in commissural axons. It remains possible, however, that NELL1 functions as a ligand for Robo3 at another spatiotemporal location. For example, NELL1-deficient mice show skeletal defects with alteration of spinal curvature that may resemble the scoliosis phenotype of human patients with horizontal gaze palsy with the progressive scoliosis disorder that is caused by a mutation in the Robo3 gene (8Desai J.

In contrast to the skeletal defects in the vertebral column, craniofacial defects of NELL1-deficient mice indicate a deficiency of neural crest cell derivatives (6Ting K. Vastardis H. Mulliken J.B.

Robo receptors and their Slit ligands form one of the most crucial ligand–receptor pairings among axon guidance molecules. However, Slit/Robo signaling not only functions in axon guidance but also in a variety of developmental events outside the nervous system (26Li Y. Zhang X.T. Wang X.Y. Wang G. Chuai M. Münsterberg A. Yang X. Robo signaling regulates the production of cranial neural crest cells.Exp. Cell Res. 2017; 361 (28987541): 73-8410.1016/j.yexcr.2017.10.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For example, Slit/Robo signaling is involved in many aspects of heart development, such as cardiac cell migration and alignment (27Zhao J. Mommersteeg M.T.M.

They also showed that Robo1 and Robo2 are predominantly expressed in mouse calvaria osteoblasts and participate in bone formation. Although at present we have no direct evidence that NELL1 interacts with intact Robo2 in vivo, NELL1 may transduce a signal through Robo2 in some conditions during craniofacial bone development. Further investigation is clearly necessary to elucidate the function of the NELL1–Robo2 interaction. Some extracellular proteins contain cryptic ligand-binding sites that have the potential to bind to ligands but are prevented from doing so under normal conditions (29Davis G.E. Bayless K.J.

Human TLS requires selective monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) sliding clamps encircling damaged DNA. This posttranslational modification (PTM) is catalyzed by Rad6/Rad18. Recent studies revealed that replication protein A (RPA), the major ssDNA-binding protein, is involved in the regulation of PCNA monoubiquitination and interacts directly with Rad18 on chromatin and in the nucleoplasm. However, it is unclear how RPA regulates this critical PTM and what functional role(s) these interactions serve. Here, we developed an in vitro assay to quantitatively monitor PCNA monoubiquitination under in vivo scenarios. Results from extensive experiments revealed that RPA regulates Rad6/Rad18 activity in an ssDNA-dependent manner. We found that “DNA-free” RPA inhibits monoubiquitination of free PCNA by directly interacting with Rad18. This interaction is promoted under native conditions when there is an overabundance of free RPA in the nucleoplasm where Rad6/Rad18 and a significant fraction of PCNA reside. During DNA replication stress, RPA binds the ssDNA exposed downstream of stalled primer/template (P/T) junctions, releasing Rad6/Rad18. RPA restricted the resident PCNAs to the upstream duplex regions by physically blocking diffusion of PCNA along ssDNA, and this activity was required for efficient monoubiquitination of PCNA on DNA. Furthermore, upon binding ssDNA, RPA underwent a conformational change that increased its affinity for Rad18. Rad6/Rad18 complexed with ssDNA-bound RPA was active, and this interaction may selectively promote monoubiquitination of PCNA on long RPA-coated ssDNA.

In eukaryotes, the replicative DNA polymerases (pols) 2The abbreviations used are: polspolymerasesPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRPAreplication protein AP/Tprimer/templateR6BRad6-bindingpoly(dT)3333-mer poly(dT)OBoligonucleotide-bindingWHwinged helixRFCreplication factor CPTMposttranslational modificationTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphineKOAcpotassium acetateSSBsingle-strand DNA–binding protein. anchor to PCNA sliding clamps encircling DNA to achieve the high degree of processivity required for efficient DNA replication (1Hedglin M.

Under native conditions, the replicative pols are rate-limited by unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) such that template bases are replicated as soon as they are available. This tight coupling limits exposure of ssDNA. However, the stringent replicative pols cannot accommodate distortions to the native DNA sequence. Prominent examples of these are modifications (lesions) to the native template bases from exposure to reactive metabolites and environmental mutagens such as UV radiation. Consequently, DNA synthesis on the afflicted template abruptly stops upon encountering these lesions but unwinding of dsDNA continues. These “uncoupling” events expose long stretches of the damaged template that are immediately coated by RPA, a heterotrimeric complex comprised of RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14 subunits. RPA is the major eukaryotic ssDNA-binding complex and protects exposed ssDNA from degradation and prevents formation of alternative DNA structures that are refractory to DNA synthesis (2Hedglin M. Benkovic S.J. Eukaryotic translesion DNA synthesis on the leading and lagging strands: Unique detours around the same obstacle.Chem. Rev. 2017; 117 (28497687): 7857-787710.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00046Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). dsDNA unwinding eventually stalls after an uncoupling event and failure to re-couple DNA synthesis and dsDNA unwinding often results in dsDNA breaks that may lead to gross chromosomal rearrangements, cell-cycle arrest, and cell death. These replicative arrests may be overcome by TLS where specialized TLS pols bind to the resident PCNA and replicate the damaged DNA, allowing DNA synthesis by a replicative pol to resume (2Hedglin M. Benkovic S.J. Eukaryotic translesion DNA synthesis on the leading and lagging strands: Unique detours around the same obstacle.Chem.

In humans, TLS requires monoubiquitination of PCNA encircling stalled P/T junctions and this critical PTM is catalyzed by Rad6/Rad18 (3Yoon J.H. Prakash S. Prakash L.

Rad6 is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that catalyzes covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a lysine residue within a target protein. On its own, Rad6 does not bind PCNA and is incapable of modifying PCNA. Furthermore, Rad6 alone can monoubiquitinate other Rad6 molecules and form mixed ubiquitin chains. The latter requires the noncovalent ubiquitin-binding site on Rad6. Selection of a target protein for Rad6 is dictated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase, such as Rad18, that simultaneously binds Rad6 and a target protein. Rad18 only functions as a homodimer and dimerization occurs through an N-terminal RING domain (Fig. S1). A Rad18 homodimer interacts with a Rad6 through two independent binding sites (4Hedglin M. Benkovic S.J. Regulation of Rad6/Rad18 activity during DNA damage tolerance.Annu. Rev.

A distinct region of a Rad18 RING domain recognizes Rad6 through a canonical interface that is conserved among all E2/E3 RING complexes (5Huang A. Hibbert R.G. de Jong R.N. Das D. Sixma T.K. Boelens R. Symmetry and asymmetry of the RING-RING dimer of Rad18.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 410 (21549715): 424-43510.1016/j.jmb.2011.04.051Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Notenboom V.

Also, the C-terminal Rad6-binding (R6B) domain of a Rad18 binds the noncovalent ubiquitin-binding site of Rad6, preventing mixed ubiquitin chain formation (7Hibbert R.G. Huang A. Boelens R. Sixma T.K. E3 ligase Rad18 promotes monoubiquitination rather than ubiquitin chain formation by E2 enzyme Rad6.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition to the RING domain, the N-terminal half of Rad18 contains multiple independent binding domains, one of which directly interacts with PCNA. Thus, Rad18 activates and targets Rad6 toward PCNA and only permits monoubiquitination (4Hedglin M. Benkovic S.J. Regulation of Rad6/Rad18 activity during DNA damage tolerance.Annu. Rev.

Recent cellular studies revealed that RPA is involved in the regulation of PCNA monoubiquitination by Rad6/Rad18 and interacts with Rad18 on chromatin and in the nucleoplasm (i.e. nonchromatin associated/soluble fraction). Interestingly, the latter are quite prominent in nonperturbed human cells (8Davies A.A. Huttner D. Daigaku Y. Chen S. Ulrich H.D.

However, it is unclear how RPA regulates this critical PTM and what functional role(s) these interactions serve. To address this, we developed an in vitro fluorescent assay to quantitatively monitor the effect of RPA on PCNA monoubiquitination under conditions that mimic in vivo scenarios.

Interestingly, PCNA protein levels are overabundant and essentially maintained throughout the cell cycle such that at least 30% of the PCNA pool resides in the nucleoplasm (i.e. free in solution) at any time. Particularly, free PCNA accounts for more than 80% of the pool throughout G1 and G2/M, which collectively last ∼16 h in rapidly proliferating human cells (19Cooper G.M. Hausman R.E.

Accordingly, we initially focused on monoubiquitination of free PCNA in solution over a biologically relevant time scale that approaches G1 phase (∼11 h) of rapidly proliferating human cells (19Cooper G.M. Hausman R.E. The Cell: A Molecular Approach.7th Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Publishers, Sunderland, MA2016Google Scholar). To comprehensively and quantitatively study PCNA monoubiquitination, we utilized fluorescence to monitor the attachment of ubiquitin to all proteins present. Human ubiquitin is devoid of cysteine and residue Glu-24 (Fig. S2A) is far removed from both the “hydrophobic patch” where ubiquitin-binding domains dock and the C-terminal glycine residue where target proteins are attached (24Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6 (16064137): 610-62110.1038/nrm1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Residue Glu-24 was mutated to cysteine (E24C) and labeled with fluorescein (Fig. S2B). All lysine residues of ubiquitin remain available for conjugation into polyubiquitin chains (7Hibbert R.G. Huang A. Boelens R. Sixma T.K. E3 ligase Rad18 promotes monoubiquitination rather than ubiquitin chain formation by E2 enzyme Rad6.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (21422291): 5590-559510.1073/pnas.1017516108Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The attachment of ubiquitin to proteins requires Rad6/Rad18 (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1–5 to lanes 8 and 9) and increases over time such that 2690 nm ± 61.7 nm ubiquitin is conjugated to proteins at 8 h (Fig. 1B). At this concentration, ∼90% of the total ubiquitin is conjugated to proteins and the fluorescence signal remains constant (Fig. S2C). Thus, attachment of fluorescein-labeled ubiquitin to proteins does not affect the fluorescence output of the dye, permitting quantitative analysis. The ubiquitinated proteins range in size from ∼20–150 kDa (Fig. 1A). In human cells, Rad18 is monoubiquitinated by Rad6 at four conserved lysine residues (Fig. S1) (25Miyase S. Tateishi S. Watanabe K. Tomita K. Suzuki K. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. Differential regulation of Rad18 through Rad6-dependent mono- and polyubiquitination.J. Biol.

This process has previously been reconstituted in vitro with recombinant human proteins and is indicated by the appearance of bands greater than 75 kDa in size (6Notenboom V.

As expected, these bands are only observed in the presence of Rad6/Rad18 (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1–5 to lanes 8 and 9) but are independent of PCNA (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1–5 to lanes 6 and 7; Fig. S3A, compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes 3 and 4). Western blotting confirmed the identity of these bands as ubiquitinated Rad18 (Fig. S3A, lanes 13–16). Rad18 is clearly the predominant ubiquitinated species and increases in fluorescence intensity over time (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–5). 2610 ± 63.6 nm of ubiquitin is conjugated to Rad18 over the incubation (Fig. 1B), indicating that each Rad18 contains approximately two ubiquitin moieties on average. A distinct band appears between 20–25 kDa in size and increases in fluorescence intensity over time (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–5). This band is only observed in the presence of Rad6/Rad18 (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1–5 to lanes 8 and 9) and is independent of PCNA (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1–5 to lanes 6 and 7; Fig. S3A, compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes 3 and 4). The molecular weight of Rad6 increases from ∼15 kDa to ∼24 kDa by the attachment of ubiquitin and Rad6 will monoubiquitinate itself in the absence of functional interactions with Rad18 (7Hibbert R.G. Huang A. Boelens R. Sixma T.K. E3 ligase Rad18 promotes monoubiquitination rather than ubiquitin chain formation by E2 enzyme Rad6.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Western blotting confirmed the identity of this band as monoubiquitinated Rad6 (Fig. S3A, lanes 9–12). Only 17.7 ± 1.62 nm of ubiquitin is conjugated to Rad6 at 8 h (Fig. 1B). Thus, monoubiquitinated Rad6 is minimal, accounting for less than 3% of the total Rad6 present. In the presence of PCNA and Rad6/Rad18 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–5), a distinct band appears between 40 and 50 kDa and increases in intensity over time. This band disappears when PCNA is removed (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1–5 to lanes 6 and 7; Fig. S3A, compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes 3 and 4). The molecular weight of a PCNA monomer increases from ∼36 kDa to ∼45 kDa by the attachment of ubiquitin (Fig. S3C) and Rad6/Rad18 will monoubiquitinate PCNA in solution (6Notenboom V.

Western blotting confirmed the identity of this band as monoubiquitinated PCNA (Fig. S3A, lanes 5–8). 71.1 ± 6.79 nm ubiquitin is conjugated to PCNA monomers over the incubation (Fig. 1B). At this concentration, 23.6 ± 2.25% of PCNA monomers are monoubiquitinated (Fig. 1C), which equates to 70.7 ± 6.76% of all PCNA homotrimers containing a single ubiquitin, on average. Altogether, these results indicate that 1) ubiquitinated Rad18 (which accounts for all Rad18 present) binds to and is functional with Rad6, 2) Rad6 and Rad18 maintain active/productive interactions throughout the incubation, and 3) Rad6/Rad18 monoubiquitinates free PCNA and this activity is prominent over a biologically relevant time scale. Rad6/Rad18 complexes are prominent in nonperturbed human cells and predominantly observed in the soluble fraction (i.e. nonchromatin associated) (8Davies A.A. Huttner D. Daigaku Y. Chen S.

Next, we repeated the assays described in Fig. 1 in the presence of free RPA. At the highest RPA concentration (6 μm), additional ubiquitinated species do not appear in fluorescence scans (Figs. S4 and S5) and ubiquitination of RPA subunits is not observed by Western blotting (Fig. S5). Thus, Rad6/Rad18 does not conjugate ubiquitin to free RPA and, hence, any observed effects are not attributable to RPA ubiquitination. Monoubiquitination of proteins (total) is slightly reduced over the range of RPA concentrations (Fig. 2) and this is primarily because of the minor reduction in Rad18 monoubiquitination. However, RPA dramatically stimulates monoubiquitination of Rad6 and such behavior is independent of PCNA (Fig. S4). Monoubiquitination of free PCNA is significantly reduced over the range of RPA concentrations, and identical results are observed by Western blotting (Fig. S4). Thus, RPA directly inhibits monoubiquitination of free PCNA by Rad6/Rad18. It should be noted that RPA was limited to ≤6 μm to maintain physiological ionic strength. At this concentration, RPA is only present at a 5-fold excess over Rad18. RPA is the most abundant ssDNA-binding protein in human cells and this high concentration is maintained throughout the cell cycle such that RPA is at least 100-fold in excess of Rad18 in unperturbed human cells (26Beck M. Schmidt A. Malmstroem J. Claassen M. Ori A. Szymborska A. Herzog F. Rinner O. Ellenberg J. Aebersold R. The quantitative proteome of a human cell line.Mol. Syst.

RPA:Rad18 ratios that approach physiological conditions are likely to further inhibit monoubiquitination of free PCNA. Rad6/Rad18 activity is imperative during DNA damage tolerance when RPA coats persistent ssDNA regions exposed by uncoupling events at replication-blocking lesions (2Hedglin M. Benkovic S.J. Eukaryotic translesion DNA synthesis on the leading and lagging strands: Unique detours around the same obstacle.Chem. Rev. 2017; 117 (28497687): 7857-787710.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00046Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hence, the observed inhibition of Rad6/Rad18 activity by free RPA must be relieved in the presence of ssDNA. To test this, we monitored the effect of ssDNA on the RPA-dependent inhibition of free PCNA monoubiquitination. We repeated the assays described above except RPA was first pre-incubated with a 33-mer poly(dT) ssDNA template (poly(dT)33) (Fig. S6). At physiological ionic strength, human RPA binds ssDNA with extremely high affinity (KD ∼ fm to pm), low cooperativity, and an occluded binding site size of 30 ± 2 nt (28Kim C. Snyder R.O. Wold M.S. Binding properties of replication protein A from human and yeast cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12 (1320195): 3050-305910.1128/MCB.12.7.3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Kim C.

Furthermore, nearly all ssDNA (24 ± 1 nt) occluded by a single RPA directly interacts with the protein (28Kim C. Snyder R.O. Wold M.S. Binding properties of replication protein A from human and yeast cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12 (1320195): 3050-305910.1128/MCB.12.7.3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Kim C.

In contrast, human Rad18 has relatively weak affinity (KD ∼ nm to μm) for purely ssDNA at minimal ionic strength (∼5 mm) and requires at least 49 nucleotides for binding to be observed (17Tsuji Y. Watanabe K. Araki K. Shinohara M. Yamagata Y. Tsurimoto T. Hanaoka F. Yamamura K. Yamaizumi M. Tateishi S. Recognition of forked and single-stranded DNA structures by human RAD18 complexed with RAD6B protein triggers its recruitment to stalled replication forks.Genes Cells. 2008; 13 (18363965): 343-35410.1111/j.1365-2443.2008.01176.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, occupation of the poly(dT)33 ssDNA by Rad6/Rad18 will be minimal, if at all. Indeed, binding of RPA to poly(dT)33 is stoichiometric at physiological ionic strength whereas binding of Rad6/Rad18 does not occur (Fig. S7 and Table S1). In the presence of excess ssDNA, additional ubiquitinated species do not appear in fluorescence scans (Figs. S5 and S8) and ubiquitination of RPA subunits is not observed by Western blotting (Fig. S5). Together with that described above, this indicates that RPA is not a ubiquitination target of Rad6/Rad18, confirming a recent report (31Elia A.E. Wang D.C. Willis N.A. Boardman A.P. Hajdu I. Adeyemi R.O. Lowry E. Gygi S.P. Scully R. Elledge S.J. RFWD3-dependent ubiquitination of RPA regulates repair at stalled replication forks.Mol.

Thus, any observed effects in the presence of ssDNA are not attributable to new ubiquitination events. The minor reductions in monoubiquitination of proteins (total) and Rad18 are essentially maintained over the range of ssDNA concentrations (Fig. 2). Hence, the observed effects on overall protein monoubiquitination are intimately correlated with Rad18 monoubiquitination. However, the RPA-dependent stimulation of Rad6 monoubiquitination is significantly dimin"

Four-week-old C57BL/6N male mice were randomly assigned to either CLP ( n = 30) or CLP-exercise (CLP+Exe; n = 30) groups. Prior to CLP-induced sepsis, the CLP+Exe mice were subjected to 8 wk of treadmill running. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA amplification sequencing to assess gut microbiota composition. Diversity analyses such as principal coordinates analysis and rarefaction curves showed that exercise preconditioning was associated with differences in gut microbiota community structure and species richness. Exercise preconditioning-induced differences in gut microbiota composition were also evident at the family level of taxonomic analysis, with the dominant phyla being Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, and, to a lesser extent, Cyanobacteria. Compared with control mice, preconditioned mice had a higher survival rate and less organ damage during the acute phase of sepsis, secondary to attenuation of the host response to septic shock. The current findings suggest that exercise preconditioning-induced modification in gut microbiota composition may lead to an attenuated host response to CLP-induced sepsis in wild-type mice, as shown by increased survival and less organ damage, as well as the establishment of a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.-Kim, D., Kang, H.

https://openalex.org/W2914465677,"Serine protease inhibitors of the Kunitz-bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) family are ubiquitous biological regulators of proteolysis. These small proteins are resistant to proteolysis, but can be slowly cleaved within the protease-binding loop by target proteases, thereby compromising their activity. For the human protease mesotrypsin, this cleavage is especially rapid. Here, we aimed to stabilize the Kunitz domain structure against proteolysis through disulfide engineering. Substitution within the Kunitz inhibitor domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APPI) that incorporated a new disulfide bond between residues 17 and 34 reduced proteolysis by mesotrypsin 74-fold. Similar disulfide engineering of tissue factor pathway inhibitor-1 Kunitz domain 1 (KD1TFPI1) and bikunin Kunitz domain 2 (KD2bikunin) likewise stabilized these inhibitors against mesotrypsin proteolysis 17- and 6.6-fold, respectively. Crystal structures of disulfide-engineered APPI and KD1TFPI1 variants in a complex with mesotrypsin at 1.5 and 2.0 A resolution, respectively, confirmed the formation of well-ordered disulfide bonds positioned to stabilize the binding loop. Long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of disulfide-engineered Kunitz domains and their complexes with mesotrypsin revealed conformational stabilization of the primed side of the inhibitor-binding loop by the engineered disulfide, along with global suppression of conformational dynamics in the Kunitz domain. Our findings suggest that the Cys-17-Cys-34 disulfide slows proteolysis by dampening conformational fluctuations in the binding loop and minimizing motion at the enzyme-inhibitor interface. The generalizable approach developed here for the stabilization against proteolysis of Kunitz domains, which can serve as important scaffolds for therapeutics, may thus find applications in drug development."

The appearance of food products may affect their perception by other senses, sometimes giving a false picture of their quality. A true assessment of such sensory attributes as aroma, taste, tenderness, and juiciness, which are components of the overall liking of food, without the use of instrumental methods is feasible only by blind people. We have advanced a hypothesis that blindness may modify the impressions perceived through other senses used in food evaluation. To confirm this hypothesis, a sensory testing of cooked breast and leg meat from various poultry species was conducted by normal sighted and blind panelists aged from 18 to 26 years. It has been demonstrated that the lack of sight is compensated by other senses, the intensified perception of which enables a more precise sensory evaluation of food in terms of such parameters as the aroma, tenderness and juiciness. Thus, blind people can be recommended as panelists evaluating the sensory profile of food products. Scores given by the sensory panel allowed the conclusion that the most desirable poultry meat was BM of broiler chicken and capon, followed by Guinea fowl. Lower scores were given by the panelists to meat of water fowl (goose, duck), whereas the lowest ones were assigned to cooked ostrich meat."
https://openalex.org/W2912756617,"Tissue-resident mast cells (MCs) are well known for their role in inflammatory responses and allergic and anaphylactic reactions, but they also contribute to processes of arterial remodeling. Although ribosomes and cytosolic RNAs are located around secretory granules in mature MCs, their functional role in MC responses remains unexplored. Previous studies by our group characterized extracellular RNA (eRNA) as an inflammatory and pathogenetic factor in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, RNA-containing MCs and eRNA were located in close proximity to growing collateral arteries in vivo. In vitro, various agonists were found to induce the degranulation of MCs and the concomitant release of eRNA in association with microvesicles (MVs). The liberation of eRNA from MCs was abolished by MC stabilizers or by preventing the increase of intracellular Ca2+ in MCs. eRNA was found to be mainly contained inside MVs, as demonstrated by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. The exposure to and the uptake of MC-released MVs by cultured endothelial cells increased their expression of cytokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein or IL-6, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These results indicate that RNA-containing MC-derived MVs are likely to be involved in inflammatory responses, relevant, for example, to processes of vascular remodeling.-Elsemüller, A.-K., Tomalla, V., Gärtner, U., Troidl, K., Jeratsch, S., Graumann, J., Baal, N., Hackstein, H., Lasch, M., Deindl, E., Preissner, K.

Although AICAr could regulate cellular energy metabolism by activating AMPK, the cytotoxic mechanisms of AICAr are still unclear. Here, we knocked out TP53 or PRKAA1 gene (encoding AMPKα1) in NALM-6 and Reh cells by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 system and found that AICAr-induced proliferation inhibition was independent of AMPK activation but dependent on p53. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of nucleotide metabolites indicated that AICAr caused an increase in adenosine triphosphate, deoxyadenosine triphosphate, and deoxyguanosine triphosphate levels by up-regulating purine biosynthesis, while AICAr led to a decrease in cytidine triphosphate, uridine triphosphate, deoxycytidine triphosphate, and deoxythymidine triphosphate levels because of reduced phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate production, which consequently impaired the pyrimidine biosynthesis. Ribonucleoside triphosphate (NTP) pool imbalances suppressed the rRNA transcription efficiency. Furthermore, deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pool imbalances induced DNA replication stress and DNA double-strand breaks, followed by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ALL cells. Exogenous uridine could rebalance the NTP and dNTP pools by supplementing pyrimidine and then attenuate AICAr-induced cytotoxicity. Our data indicate that RNA transcription inhibition and DNA replication stress induced by NTP and dNTP pool imbalances might play a key role in AICAr-mediated cytotoxic effects on ALL cells, suggesting a potential clinical application of AICAr in future ALL therapy.-Du, L., Yang, F., Fang, H., Sun, H., Chen, Y., Xu, Y., Li, H., Zheng, L., Zhou, B.-B.

https://openalex.org/W2912850119,"Sensitivity analysis applied to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as well as to other types of empirical ecological models allows assessing the importance of environmental predictive variables in affecting species distribution or other target variables. However, approaches that only consider values of the environmental variables that are likely to be observed in real-world conditions, given the underlying ecological relationships with other variables, have not yet been proposed. Here, a constrained sensitivity analysis procedure is presented, which evaluates the importance of the environmental variables considering only their plausible changes, thereby exploring only ecological meaningful scenarios. To demonstrate the procedure, we applied it to an ANN model predicting fish species richness, as identifying relationships between environmental variables and fish species occurrence in river ecosystems is a recurring topic in freshwater ecology. Results showed that several environmental variables played a less relevant role in driving the model output when that sensitivity analysis allowed them to vary only within an ecologically meaningful range of values, i.e. avoiding values that the model would never handle in its practical applications. By comparing percent changes in MSE between constrained and unconstrained sensitivity analysis, the relative importance of environmental variables was found to be different, with habitat descriptors and urbanization factors that played a more relevant role according to the constrained procedure. The ecologically constrained procedure can be applied to any sensitivity analysis method for ANNs, but obviously it can also be applied to other types of empirical ecological models."

Several miRNAs are exclusively expressed in skeletal muscle and participate in the regulation of muscle differentiation by interacting with myogenic factors. These miRNAs can be found at high levels in the serum of patients and animal models for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is expected to be useful as biomarkers for their clinical conditions. By miRNA microarray analysis, we identified miR-188 as a novel miRNA that is elevated in the serum of the muscular dystrophy dog model, CXMDJ. miR-188 was not muscle-specific miRNA, but its expression was up-regulated in skeletal muscles associated with muscle regeneration induced by cardiotoxin-injection in normal dogs and mice. Manipulation of miR-188 expression using antisense oligo and mimic oligo RNAs alters the mRNA expression of the myogenic regulatory factors, MRF4 and MEF2C. Our results suggest that miR-188 is a new player that participates in the gene regulation process of muscle differentiation and that it may serve as a serum biomarker reflecting skeletal muscle regeneration."

The purpose of the current study was to isolate and characterize stromal cells of the tumor microenvironment in CM. Four different patient-derived cell lines (PDCs) of stromal and one PDC of tumorigenic origin were generated from breast or lung CM. PDCs were analyzed by DNA/RNA sequencing, DNA methylation profiling, and immunophenotypic assays. The stromal derived PDCs were termed CNS metastasis-associated stromal cells (cMASCs). Functional analysis of cMASCs was tested by co-implanting them with tumorigenic cells in mice. cMASCs displayed normal genotypes compared with tumorigenic cell lines. RNA-seq and DNA methylation analyses demonstrated that cMASCs highly resembled each other, suggesting a common cell of origin. Additionally, cMASCs revealed gene expression signatures associated with cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), epithelial to mesenchymal transition, mesenchymal stem cells and expressed high levels of collagen. Functionally, cMASCs restricted tumor growth, and induced desmoplasia in vivo, suggesting that cMASCs may promote a protective host response to impede tumor growth.

Scarce studies on gene-microbiome interactions show very little overlap in their results. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that gene-microbiome studies are repeated. We aimed to replicate the association between the SLC39A8 [Thr]391 risk allele and gut microbiome composition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and healthy controls. Methods We collected faecal samples, peripheral blood and extensive phenotype data from 291 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 476 healthy controls. Carrier status information was obtained from whole exome sequencing data, generated using the Illumina HiSeq. The gut microbiome composition was determined by tag-sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Associations between carrier status and disease were tested using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Associations between carriers and gut microbiome composition were determined using principal coordinate analyses, variance explained, alpha diversity and additive general linear models in inflammatory bowel disease, healthy controls and all groups combined. Results Crohn’s disease patients were more often carriers of the missense variant (21/171, 12.3%) than controls (30/476, 6.3%) (OR = 2.1, P = 0.01). We could not identify associations between carrier status and overall gut microbiome composition and microbial richness in all tested groups after correcting for potential confounding factors. We did identify 37 different operational taxonomical units to be associated with carrier status among the tested groups. Two of these 37 were identified before in the discovery study. Conclusions We could confirm the genetic association of the SLC39A8 [Thr]391 risk allele with Crohn’s disease but we could only limited replicate the association in gut microbiome composition. Independent replication of gene-microbiome studies is warranted to identify true biological mechanisms."

Previously, our lab showed in vitro heteromer formation between angiotensin II receptor type 1 subtype a (AT1aR) and secretin receptor (SCTR), which is involved in in vivo control of hyperosmolality-induced water drinking behavior. Because the secretin (SCT)/SCTR axis is crucial to the central actions of angiotensin II (ANGII) and both SCT and ANGII are capable of triggering vasopressin (Vp) release from hypothalamus, we investigated here the in vivo role of SCTR-AT1aR heteromer in regulating Vp release in hypothalamus using transmembrane peptides as tools. We showed that SCTR-AT1aR heteromer mediates stimulatory actions of both SCT and ANGII in hypothalamic Vp expression and release as well as neuronal activities via the immediate early gene cFos. The results from this study not only are consistent with our hypothesis that SCT and ANGII interact at the receptor level to mediate their water homeostatic activities but also provide evidence for in vivo functions of cross-class GPCR heteromers.-Mak, S.

However, the mechanisms by which GABAergic system dysfunctions induce the pathophysiology of ASD remain unclear. We previously demonstrated that a selective type I 5α-reductase inhibitor SKF105111 (SKF) induced ASD-like behaviors, such as impaired sociability-related performance and repetitive grooming behaviors, in male mice. Moreover, the effects of SKF were caused by a decrease in the endogenous levels of allopregnanolone (ALLO), a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. In this study, we used SKF-treated male mice as a putative animal model of ASD and examined the effects of Kami-shoyo-san (KSS) as an experimental therapeutic strategy for ASD. KSS is a traditional Kampo formula consisting of 10 different crude drugs and has been used for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms. KSS dose-dependently attenuated sociability deficits and suppressed an increase in grooming behaviors in SKF-treated mice without affecting ALLO content in the prefrontal cortex. The systemic administration of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 reversed the ameliorative effects of KSS. On the other hand, the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride and GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline only attenuated the ameliorative effect of KSS on repetitive self-grooming behaviors. The present results indicate that KSS improves SKF-induced ASD-like behaviors by facilitating dopamine receptor-mediated mechanisms and partly by neurosteroid-independent GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission. Therefore, KSS is a potential candidate for the treatment of ASD."

We investigated these processes in a controlled environment (Montpellier European Ecotron) applying a continuous 13CO2 label for three weeks to 12 soil-vegetation monoliths originating from a grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment) and representing two diversity levels (4 and 16 sown species). Plant species richness did not affect community- and species-level 13C abundances neither in total biomass nor in non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). Community-level 13C excess tended to be higher in the 16-species than in the 4-species mixtures. Community-level 13C excess was positively related to canopy leaf nitrogen (N), i.e. leaf N per unit soil surface. At the species level, shoot 13C abundances varied among plant functional groups and were larger in legumes and tall herbs than in grasses and small herbs, and correlated positively with traits as leaf N concentrations, stomatal conductance and shoot height. The 13C abundances in NSC were larger in transport sugars (sucrose, raffinose-family oligosaccharides) than in free glucose, fructose and compounds of the storage pool (starch) suggesting that newly assimilated carbon is to a small portion allocated to storage. Our results emphasize that the functional composition of communities is key in explaining carbon assimilation in grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W2914955934,"The antibiotic bacitracin (Bac) inhibits cell wall synthesis of gram-positive bacteria. Here, we discovered a totally different activity of Bac: the neutralization of bacterial exotoxins. Bac prevented intoxication of mammalian cells with the binary enterotoxins Clostridium botulinum C2, C. perfringens ι, C. difficile transferase (CDT), and Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin. The transport (B) subunits of these toxins deliver their respective enzyme (A) subunits into cells. Following endocytosis, the B subunits form pores in membranes of endosomes, which mediate translocation of the A subunits into the cytosol. Bac inhibited formation of such B pores in lipid bilayers in vitro and in living cells, thereby preventing translocation of the A subunit into the cytosol. Bac preserved the epithelial integrity of toxin-treated CaCo-2 monolayers, a model for the human gut epithelium. In conclusion, Bac should be discussed as a therapeutic option against infections with medically relevant toxin-producing bacteria, including C. difficile and B. anthracis, because it inhibits bacterial growth and neutralizes the secreted toxins.-Schnell, L., Felix, I., Müller, B., Sadi, M., von Bank, F., Papatheodorou, P., Popoff, M.

https://openalex.org/W2889758478,"Various feature selection algorithms have been proposed to identify cancer prognostic biomarkers. In recent years, however, their reproducibility is criticized. The performance of feature selection algorithms is shown to be affected by the datasets, underlying networks and evaluation metrics. One of the causes is the curse of dimensionality, which makes it hard to select the features that generalize well on independent data. Even the integration of biological networks does not mitigate this issue because the networks are large and many of their components are not relevant for the phenotype of interest. With the availability of multi-omics data, integrative approaches are being developed to build more robust predictive models. In this scenario, the higher data dimensions create greater challenges. We proposed a phenotype relevant network-based feature selection (PRNFS) framework and demonstrated its advantages in lung cancer prognosis prediction. We constructed cancer prognosis relevant networks based on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and integrated them with different types of omics data for feature selection. With less than 2.5% of the total dimensionality, we obtained EMT prognostic signatures that achieved remarkable prediction performance (average AUC values >0.8), very significant sample stratifications, and meaningful biological interpretations. In addition to finding EMT signatures from different omics data levels, we combined these single-omics signatures into multi-omics signatures, which improved sample stratifications significantly. Both single- and multi-omics EMT signatures were tested on independent multi-omics lung cancer datasets and significant sample stratifications were obtained."

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to examine the probabilities of locoregional recurrence, local recurrence and distant metastases according to individual prognosis score, stratified by type of surgery (breast conserving therapy or mastectomy). The possible confounding of the relationship between recurrence risk and MDAPI by established risk factors was accounted for in multiple survival regression models. To define the clinical utility of the MDAPI we analyzed its performance to predict locoregional recurrence censoring patients with prior or simultaneous distant metastases.Mastectomized patients (42% of the patients) presented with more advanced tumor stage, lower tumor grade, hormone-receptor positive disease and consequently lower pathological complete response rates. Only a few patients presented with high-risk scores (2,7% MDAPI≥3). All patients with high-risk MDAPI score (MDAPI ≥3) who developed locoregional recurrence were simultaneously affected by distant metastases.Our data do not support a clinical utility of the MDAPI to guide local therapy."

Here, we report that myocardial-specific deletion of Jarid2 using αMHC::Cre mice (Jarid2αMHC) causes dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and premature death 6–9 months after birth. To determine functions of Jarid2 in the adult heart and DCM, we analyzed gene expression in the heart at postnatal day (p)10 (neonatal) and 7 months (DCM). Pathway analyses revealed that dysregulated genes in Jarid2αMHC hearts at p10, prior to cardiomyopathy, represented heart development and muscle contraction pathways. At 7 months, down-regulated genes in Jarid2αMHC hearts were enriched in metabolic process and ion channel activity pathways and up-regulated genes in extracellular matrix components. In normal hearts, expression levels of contractile genes were increased from p10 to 7 months but were not sufficiently increased in Jarid2αMHC hearts. Moreover, Jarid2 was also necessary to repress fetal contractile genes such as TroponinI1, slow skeletal type (Tnni1) and Actin alpha 2, smooth muscle (Acta2) in neonatal stages through ErbB2-receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ErbB4) signaling. Interestingly, Ankyrin repeat domain 1 (Ankrd1) and Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1), whose expression levels are known to be increased in the failing heart, were already elevated in Jarid2αMHC hearts within 1 month of birth. Thus, we demonstrate that ablation of Jarid2 in cardiomyocytes results in DCM and suggest that Jarid2 plays important roles in cardiomyocyte maturation during neonatal stages."

We examine if there is a clear age threshold between young and old patients at which there is a need for extra care and facilities in the emergency department. This retrospective cohort study uses emergency department (ED) data collected over the course of a year, containing information about 31,491 patient visits. The measured variables are treatment time, waiting time, number of tests, number of medical procedures, number of specialties involved and the patient’s length of stay on the ED. To examine the multivariate differences between different patient groups, the data set is split into eighteen age groups and a MANOVA analysis is conducted to compare group means. The results show that older patients tend to have a longer stay on the ED. They also require more medical tests, have higher resource utilization and admission rates to the hospital. When the patients are grouped according to life stages (<18, 18-39, 40-64 and ≥65), each life stage shows significantly different characteristics across all variables. To understand where these differences start, age bins of five years are analyzed and almost none of the consecutive groups are significantly different in any variable. A significant difference between all groups is observed when age interval of the bins is increased to 10 years. This indicates that although age has an effect on the patient’s treatment, a clear age threshold that identifies the group of elderly patients is not observable from emergency room variables. The results of this study show no clear age boundary between young and old patients. In other words, we could not find support for favoring the often-used age boundary of 65 over other boundaries (e.g. 60 or 70) to distinguish the group of elderly patients on the ED."

Since the recommendations concerning cervical cancer management adopted by Polish medical societies do not differ significantly from the ESGO or non-European guidelines, and the fact that evaluation of the system for CC treatment in Poland, as well as the mortality rate of Polish women with CC, which is 70% higher than the average for European Union (EU) countries, justifies the hypothesis that treatment of CC in Poland deviates from the Polish and international recommendations. This article puts forward the current management of cervical cancer in Poland and discusses it in the context of ASCO guidelines.A survey retrospective multicenter analysis of the medical records of 1247 patients with cervical cancer who underwent treatment for disease and who had completed at least two years of follow-up.Although concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy is a standard treatment of FIGO IB to IVA cervical cancer patients in enhanced- and maximum-resources settings, in our analysis, we found that the percentage of women subjected to chemotherapy was lower than in countries where total survival rates were lower.Within the IA to II A cervical cancer patients studied group, the methods of treatment remained in line with ASCO guidelines for countries with the highest standard of care. Although concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy is a standard treatment of FIGO IB to IVA cervical cancer patients in enhanced- and maximum-resources settings, in our analysis, we found that the percentage of women subjected to chemotherapy was lower than in countries where total survival rates were lower. Our findings, together with the inconsistencies within the cervical cancer screening program, may be one of the explanations of poorer survival rate of women with cervical cancer in Poland."
https://openalex.org/W2949380916,"In the airway network of a human lung, the airway diameter gradually decreases through multiple branching. The diameter reduction ratio of the conducting airways that transport gases without gas exchange is 0.79, but this reduction ratio changes to 0.94 in acinar airways beyond transitional bronchioles. While the reduction in the conducting airways was previously rationalized on the basis of Murray’s law, our understanding of the design principle behind the acinar airways has been far from clear. Here we elucidate that the change in gas transfer mode is responsible for the transition in the diameter reduction ratio. The oxygen transfer rate per unit surface area is maximized at the observed geometry of acinar airways, which suggests the minimum cost for the construction and maintenance of the acinar airways. The results revitalize and extend the framework of Murray’s law over an entire human lung."
https://openalex.org/W2953088255,"RB-E2F transcriptional control plays a key role in regulating the timing of cell cycle progression from G1 to S-phase in response to growth factor stimulation. Despite this role, it is genetically dispensable for cell cycle exit in primary fibroblasts in response to growth arrest signals. Mice engineered to be defective for RB-E2F transcriptional control at cell cycle genes were also found to live a full lifespan with no susceptibility to cancer. Based on this background we sought to probe the vulnerabilities of RB-E2F transcriptional control defects found in Rb1R461E,K542E mutant mice (Rb1G) through genetic crosses with other mouse strains. We generated Rb1G/G mice in combination with Trp53 and Cdkn1a deficiencies, as well as in combination with KrasG12D. The Rb1G mutation enhanced Trp53 cancer susceptibility, but had no effect in combination with Cdkn1a deficiency or KrasG12D. Collectively, this study indicates that compromised RB-E2F transcriptional control is not uniformly cancer enabling, but rather has potent oncogenic effects when combined with specific vulnerabilities."
