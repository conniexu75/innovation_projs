https://openalex.org/W1980493259,"Centrosomes consist of a centriole pair surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM). Previous work suggested that centrioles are required to organize PCM to form a structurally stable organelle. Here, we characterize SAS-4, a centriole component in Caenorhabditis elegans. Like tubulin, SAS-4 is incorporated into centrioles during their duplication and remains stably associated thereafter. In the absence of SAS-4, centriole duplication fails. Partial depletion of SAS-4 results in structurally defective centrioles that contain reduced levels of SAS-4 and organize proportionally less PCM. Thus, SAS-4 is a centriole-associated component whose amount dictates centrosome size. These results provide novel insight into the poorly understood role of centrioles as centrosomal organizers."

Treatment of mice with a potent and specific LXR agonist, T0901317, is associated with increased biliary cholesterol secretion, decreased fractional cholesterol absorption, and increased fecal neutral sterol excretion. Here we show that expression of two target genes of LXRα, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transportersAbcg5 and Abcg8, is required for both the increase in sterol excretion and the decrease in fractional cholesterol absorption associated with LXR agonist treatment. Mice expressing no ABCG5 and ABCG8 (G5G8 −/− mice) and their littermate controls were treated for 7 days with T0901317. In wild type animals, treatment with the LXR agonist resulted in a 3-fold increase in biliary cholesterol concentrations, a 25% reduction in fractional cholesterol absorption, and a 4-fold elevation in fecal neutral sterol excretion. In contrast, the LXR agonist did not significantly affect biliary cholesterol levels, fractional cholesterol absorption, or neutral fecal sterol excretion in the G5G8 −/−mice. Thus Abcg5 and Abcg8 are required for LXR agonist-associated changes in dietary and biliary sterol trafficking. These results establish a central role for ABCG5 and ABCG8 in promoting cholesterol excretion in vivo.

The cholesterol required to maintain membrane integrity can be synthesized de novo from acetyl-CoA or can be obtained from cholesterol-containing foods in the diet. The typical Western diet includes ∼400 mg of cholesterol per day, of which 40–50% is absorbed in the proximal small intestine. The major pathway by which cholesterol is eliminated from the body is by excretion into bile either as free cholesterol or after conversion to bile acids. A variety of noncholesterol sterols are also present in the diet. The most plentiful of these are the two plant sterols, sitosterol and campesterol. The levels of these sterols in tissues are very low, because plant sterols are poorly absorbed from the intestine and are preferentially secreted into the bile by hepatocytes (1Schoenheimer R.

One mechanism by which excess cholesterol and other sterols are eliminated from the body involves the action of two ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1half-transporters, ABCG5 and ABCG8 (4Berge K.E. Tian H.

Mutations in either of these genes cause sitosterolemia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of sterol trafficking (4Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A. Yu L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B.

Subjects with sitosterolemia have increased fractional absorption of dietary noncholesterol sterols and decreased biliary secretion of plant- and animal-derived sterols (6Miettinen T.A. Eur. J. Clin.

Consequently, these patients accumulate sitosterol, as well as other plant- and shellfish-derived neutral sterols, in the blood and tissues (8Salen G. Horak I. Rothkopf M. Cohen J.L. Speck J.

Subjects with sitosterolemia also are frequently hypercholesterolemic and develop tendon xanthomas and premature coronary artery disease (8Salen G. Horak I. Rothkopf M. Cohen J.L. Speck J. Tint G.S.

The pivotal role of ABCG5 and ABCG8 in enterohepatic sterol transport has been demonstrated directly by manipulating the expression of these genes in mice (11Yu L. Li-Hawkins J. Hammer R.E.

Transgenic mice containing ∼14 copies of a human genomic DNA fragment, including both human ABCG5 andABCG8 genes have a ∼50% reduction in the fractional absorption of dietary cholesterol, dramatically elevated levels of biliary cholesterol, and a 4.5-fold increase in fecal neutral sterol excretion (11Yu L.

Plant sterol levels are more than 50% lower in these mice than in their wild type littermates. Disruption of the mouseAbcg5 and Abcg8 genes has the opposite effect on dietary sterol trafficking. The G5G8 −/− mice have 30-fold higher plasma levels of sitosterol than do their wild type littermates due to increased fractional absorption of dietary plant sterols and impaired biliary sterol excretion (12Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Abcg5 and Abcg8 are expressed predominantly in the liver and small intestine (4Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A. Yu L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H.

By regulating the expression of these genes, LXRα coordinates the synthesis and trafficking of cholesterol and fatty acids between tissues. Mice lacking LXRα accumulate large amounts of cholesterol in the liver when fed a high cholesterol diet (21Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which LXRα prevents the accumulation of dietary cholesterol has not been fully defined. The decreased fractional absorption of dietary cholesterol associated with LXR agonist treatment was attributed initially to the action of ABCA1, because levels of ABCA1 mRNA increased dramatically in the small intestine of animals given the nonsteroidal synthetic LXR agonist:N-(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethyl)-N-[4-(2,2,2trifluoro-1-hydroxy-1-trifluoromethyl-ethyl)phenyl]benzenesulfonamide (T0901317) (14Repa J.J.

Subsequent characterization of mice expressing no ABCA1 (Abca1 −/− mice) revealed no impairment in biliary cholesterol secretion or fecal neutral sterol excretion (25Groen A.K. Bloks V.W.

In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that ABCG5 and ABCG8 mediate the LXR agonist-associated increase in biliary and fecal excretion of cholesterol and reduction in cholesterol absorption. The synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). Sterols were obtained either from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI) or from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Mice homozygous for a disruptedAbcg5 and Abcg8 allele (G5G8 −/−) were generated as described previously (12Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The mice used in these studies were offspring ofG5G8 +/− mice of mixed genetic background (129S6SvEv × C57BL/6J). The mice were housed in plastic cages in a temperature-controlled room (22 °C) with a daylight cycle from 6 am to 6 pm, and fed ad libitum a cereal-based rodent chow diet (Diet 7001, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) containing 0.02% cholesterol and 4% fat. All animal procedures were performed with approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Diets containing 0.025% of T0901317 (T-diet) were made by mixing powdered chow diet (Diet 7001, Harlan Teklad) with pure T0901317. The T-diet was stored in aluminum foil-covered containers at 4 °C for no more than 3 days. Female mice were housed individually 1 week before initiation of the T-diet and then fed for 1 week with either the T-diet or the chow diet dispensed from a feeder jar. The dose and duration of T0901317 treatment were based on prior studies (14Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Briefly, plasma and tissues were saponified in 3% potassium hydroxide/ethanol at 66 °C for 3 h after addition of 5α-cholestane as a quantitative recovery standard. Lipids were extracted using petroleum ether and dried under nitrogen. The residual lipids were re-dissolved in Tri-Sil reagent (product 48999, Pierce, Rockford, IL) for analysis by GC. Hepatic triglyceride levels were measured using Infinity triglycerides reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Lipoproteins were size-fractionated using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), and the total sterol concentration in each fraction was measured using cholesterol/HP kits (catalog number 1127771, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). Bile was collected from the gallbladder of anesthetized mice using a 30.5-gauge needle. The concentrations of cholesterol, phospholipids, and bile acids were measured as described previously (30Turley S.D. Daggy B.P. Dietschy J.M. Metabolism. 1991; 40: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mice were fed either the control or T-diet for 4 days prior to being moved to new cages containing fresh wood shavings. The diets were fed for an additional 3 days during which time the feces were collected. The feces were dried, weighed, and ground to a fine powder. An aliquot of 0.5 g of feces was used to determine fecal neutral and acidic sterol excretion (11Yu L. Li-Hawkins J. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin.

Mice were then housed individually in new cages containing fresh wood shavings. The diets were continued, and the feces were collected for 3 days and processed for sterol absorption as described (12Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C.

Total RNA was extracted from tissues using the RNA Stat-60 kit (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX), and real-time PCR was performed to assay the relative amounts of selected mRNAs as described (31Yang J.

The differences between the mean values were tested for statistical significance by the two-tailed Student's ttest. Plasma levels of sitosterol and campesterol were 30-fold higher inG5G8 −/− than in G5G8 +/+female mice fed a chow diet. Addition of T0901317 (0.025%) to the diet for 7 days resulted in a fall of plasma plant sterol levels to barely detectable levels in wild type mice. Mean plasma sitosterol levels increased from 20.6 to 39.6 mg/dl in the LXR agonist-treated knockout animals (Fig. 1); an increase of similar magnitude occurred in the plasma level of campesterol, the other major dietary plant sterol. Mean plasma levels of cholesterol were lower in chow-fedG5G8 −/− mice than in wild type mice, as previously described (12Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The levels of plasma cholesterol increased by 50% and by 90% in the wild type mice andG5G8 −/− mice with T0901317 treatment. FPLC analysis was performed to determine the distribution of sterols in the plasma of these mice. No significant difference was seen in the distribution of sterols in the knockout and wild type mice. The increase in plasma sterol levels was due to increases of HDL sterols in both strains of mice (Fig. 2). Treatment with T019101317 was associated with widening of the HDL sterol peaks and a shoulder extending into the larger size fractions, as has been reported previously (26Plosch T. Kok T. Bloks V.W.

T0901317 treatment increased biliary cholesterol levels of wild type mice by almost 3-fold (from 7.13 to 20.12 μmol/ml), as was observed previously (26Plosch T. Kok T. Bloks V.W. Smit M.J. Havinga R. Chimini G. Groen A.K. Kuipers F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33870-33877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). In contrast to wild type mice, no significant increase in mean biliary cholesterol level was seen in the G5G8 −/− mice after treatment with T0901317 (from 0.73 to 0.97 μmol/ml). These data are consistent with Abcg5 and Abcg8 being the target genes responsible for the increase in biliary cholesterol levels associated with LXR activation. Biliary phospholipid levels were significantly lower in the knockout than in the wild type mice. A similar difference in biliary phospholipid levels was observed previously in female, but not male,G5G8 −/− mice (12Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Biliary phospholipids and bile acid levels fell after T0901317 treatment in theG5G8 +/+ mice but not in theG5G8 −/− mice (Fig. 3). Similar reductions in biliary lipid levels were seen previously in wild type mice treated with an LXR agonist (26Plosch T. Kok T. Bloks V.W. Smit M.J. Havinga R. Chimini G. Groen A.K. Kuipers F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33870-33877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Levels of plant sterols were significantly higher in chow-fed G5G8 −/− mice than in wild type animals. G5G8 −/− mice have increased fractional absorption of dietary plant sterols and a decrease in the biliary excretion of sterols, which contribute to the higher hepatic levels of plant sterols in these mice (12Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Treatment of theG5G8 −/− mice with T0901317 resulted in a modest, but significant reduction in hepatic sitosterol and campesterol levels (Fig. 4). The hepatic cholesterol level fell by 30% in the wild type mice after treatment with T0901317, presumably in part due to the increase in biliary cholesterol secretion (Fig. 4). In contrast to the wild type mice, no change in hepatic cholesterol levels was seen in the knockout mice after LXR agonist treatment, presumably resulting from the lack of increase in biliary cholesterol secretion in these mice (Fig. 4). Hepatic triglyceride levels were similar in the chow-fedG5G8 +/+ and G5G8 −/−mice. Treatment with T090137 was associated with an increase in hepatic triglycerides in both groups of mice (Fig. 4), as previously observed (27Schultz J.R. Tu H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C. Li L.

These results are attributed to the activation ofSREBP-1c, which stimulates the expression of multiple genes in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway and is an LXR target gene (23Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). The fractional absorption of dietary cholesterol was reduced from 72% to 52% in the wild type mice treated with T0901317, which is similar to that observed by Repa et al. (14Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild type mice, the fractional absorption of cholesterol increased slightly (from 76% to 81%) in T0901317-treated G5G8 −/− mice (Fig.5). Decreased fractional cholesterol absorption and increased biliary cholesterol secretion both may contribute to the dramatic increase in fecal neutral sterol excretion that occurs with LXR agonist treatment (14Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 26Plosch T. Kok T.

The level of neutral sterols excreted into the feces over the 3-day collection period was ∼30% lower in the chow-fed G5G8 −/− mice than in the G5G8 +/+ mice, and this level failed to increase with T0901317 treatment (Fig.6). Thus, ABCG5 and ABCG8 are required for the stimulation of fecal neutral sterol excretion by the LXR agonist T0901317. Fecal bile acid excretion was similar in theG5G8 +/+ and G5G8 −/−mice and did not change significantly with T0901317 treatment (Fig.6). The mRNA levels of known LXR target genes, including Srebp-1c,Abca1, Abcg1, Abcg5, andAbcg8, were determined to confirm that T0901317 had the expected biological effects in the tissues of the treated mice. The expression levels of all selected LXR target genes were increased with T0901317 treatment in both strains of mice with the exceptions ofAbcg5 and Abcg8 inG5G8 −/− mice. The mRNA levels ofSrebp-2, which is not a target gene of LXR, did not increase significantly with T0901317 treatment in either wild type orG5G8 −/− mice (Fig.7). The major finding of this study is that ABCG5 and ABCG8 are required in mice for the stimulation of biliary and fecal cholesterol excretion by the synthetic LXR agonist, T0901317. Disruption ofAbcg5 and Abcg8 abolished the increase in biliary cholesterol levels, the reduction in fractional cholesterol absorption, and the increase in fecal neutral sterol excretion associated with LXR activation (14Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 26Plosch T. Kok T.

These data, taken together with the phenotypic characterization of mice expressing either no ABCG5 and ABCG8 or higher levels of both proteins (11Yu L. Li-Hawkins J. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 12Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), suggest that LXR activation promotes the excretion of sterols by increasing Abcg5 andAbcg8 expression. In wild type mice, treatment with the LXR agonist was associated with significantly lower plasma levels of both sitosterol and campesterol (Fig. 1). Similar reductions in plasma plant sterol levels were seen in transgenic mice containing 14 copies of the human ABCG5 andABCG8 transgenes (11Yu L. Li-Hawkins J. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild type mice, plasma levels of sitosterol and campesterol increased ∼2-fold with T0901317 treatment in the G5G8 −/− mice (Fig. 1). These data indicate that increased expression of Abcg5 andAbcg8 is both necessary and sufficient for the LXR agonist-associated reduction in plasma plant sterol levels observed in the wild type animals. In the absence of ABCG5 and ABCG8, plant sterols accumulate in the liver due to an inability to efficiently secrete sterols into the bile and an increased absorption of dietary plant sterols (12Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The increased hepatic levels of plant sterols in the knockout animals likely result in an increased incorporation of these sterols into lipoproteins and secretion into plasma. Further studies are required to determine if LXR agonist treatment results in a greater increase in the incorporation of plant sterols into lipoproteins or an increased secretion of lipoproteins into the circulation inG5G8 −/− mice. The LXR agonist also may promote the transport of sterols from peripheral tissues into the circulation of G5G8 −/− mice. Plasma cholesterol levels also increased significantly with T0901317 treatment in G5G8 +/+ andG5G8 −/− mice (Fig. 1). The increase in plasma cholesterol was limited to the HDL fraction (Fig. 2) and was associated with an increase in the size of HDL particles, as reported previously (27Schultz J.R. Tu H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C. Li L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar, 33Joseph S.B.

The fall in hepatic cholesterol levels (Fig. 4) in theG5G8 +/+ mice with LXR activation may also in part be due to an ABCA1-mediated increase in the efflux of cholesterol from the liver into the circulation (14Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 26Plosch T. Kok T.

The most dramatic difference between G5G8 +/+ andG5G8 −/− mice in response to T0901317 treatment was in biliary cholesterol levels. Mean biliary cholesterol levels increased 3-fold in wild type mice but did not change significantly in knockout mice. Biliary phospholipid and bile acid levels were lower in the G5G8 −/− mice than in their wild type littermates, which is comparable to the reductions observed previously in female mice (12Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Both the biliary phospholipid and bile acid levels fell in wild type mice treated with T0901317 (Fig. 3), as was seen previously in mice treated with LXR agonists (26Plosch T. Kok T. Bloks V.W. Smit M.J. Havinga R. Chimini G. Groen A.K. Kuipers F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33870-33877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). No reduction in the levels of bile acids or phospholipids in the bile occurred in the T0901317-treated G5G8 −/− mice. No change in fecal bile acid excretion was seen in either the knockout or the wild type animals treated with the LXR agonist (Fig. 6). Therefore, the increased excretion of biliary cholesterol associated with LXR agonist treatment was not quantitatively coupled to biliary bile acid or phospholipid excretion. The results of these studies demonstrate that ABCG5 and ABCG8 mediate the effects of LXR agonists on the increase in fecal loss of cholesterol. These studies do not distinguish the relative contributions of the liver and the intestine to the increased fecal neutral sterol excretion. The stimulation of fecal cholesterol loss by the LXR agonist may result from an increase in biliary cholesterol secretion by hepatocytes and/or the decreased fractional absorption of dietary cholesterol by enterocytes. Tissue-specific disruptions ofAbcg5 and Abcg8 will be required to assess the function of these transporters in the liver and small intestine. Reverse cholesterol transport involves the efflux of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, the secretion of cholesterol into bile, and the excretion of sterols in feces. The molecular machinery that affects reverse cholesterol transport has not been fully characterized. The data in this report are consistent with the notion that two ABC half-transporters, ABCG5 and ABCG8, mediate the final step in this pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2141055054,"Spindle alignment is the process in which the two spindle poles are directed toward preselected and opposite cell ends. In budding yeast, the APC-related molecule Kar9 is required for proper alignment of the spindle with the mother-bud axis. We find that Kar9 localizes to the prospective daughter cell spindle pole. Kar9 is transferred from the pole to cytoplasmic microtubules, which are then guided in a myosin-dependent manner to the bud. Clb4/Cdc28 kinase phosphorylates Kar9 and accumulates on the pole destined to the mother cell. Mutations that block phosphorylation at Cdc28 consensus sites result in localization of Kar9 to both poles and target them both to the bud. Thus, Clb4/Cdc28 prevents Kar9 loading on the mother bound pole. In turn, asymmetric distribution of Kar9 ensures that only one pole orients toward the bud. Our results indicate that Cdk1-dependent spindle asymmetry ensures proper alignment of the mitotic spindle with the cell division axis."

In the current studies we sought to identify novel ER stress-induced genes by conducting microarray analysis on tunicamycin-treated cells. We identified P58IPK, an inhibitor of the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, as induced during ER stress. Additional studies suggested that p58 IPK induction was mediated via ATF6 and that P58IPK played a role in down-regulating the activity of the pancreatic eIF2 kinase/eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α)-like ER kinase/activation transcription factor (ATF) 4 pathway. Modulation of P58IPK levels altered the phosphorylation status of eIF2α, and thereby affected expression of its downstream targets, ATF4 and Gadd153. Overexpression of P58IPK inhibited eIF2α phosphorylation and reduced ATF4 and Gadd153 protein accumulation, whereas silencing of P58IPK expression enhanced pancreatic eIF2α-like ER kinase and eIF2α phosphorylation and increased ATF4 and Gadd153 accumulation. These findings implicate P58IPK as an important component of a negative feedback loop used by the cell to inhibit eIF2α signaling, and thus attenuate the unfolded protein response.

Perturbations in the ER environment result in a condition known as ER stress, which can threaten cell survival. ER stress can be induced in cells by a variety of treatments including agents known to affect calcium homeostasis, inhibitors of glycosylation, and overloading of the cell with mutant proteins that cannot be properly folded. Such stress triggers the activation of a complex response termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), which in mammalian cells is characterized by coordinate transcriptional up-regulation of a number of proteins including molecular chaperones and folding enzymes, global inhibition of protein synthesis, and activation of apoptotic pathways (1Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). The first two components serve to reduce the load of client proteins and alleviate the stress, whereas the third functions to eliminate severely damaged cells. At least three separate mechanisms contribute to the transcriptional response to ER stress in mammalian cells. The first involves IRE1α and IRE1β, transmembrane protein kinases with endoribonuclease function, that sense the presence of unfolded proteins in the ER, leading to their activation (2Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 3Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In turn, activation of IRE1 results in the splicing of mRNA encoding the transcription factor XBP-1, increasing its efficiency of translation, thereby enhancing its expression (5Calfon M. Zeng H.

A second mechanism contributing to the transcriptional response to ER stresses is mediated through the ATF6 transcription factor, a member of the ATF/cAMP-response element-binding protein family of basic leucine zipper proteins. ATF6 is a type II ER transmembrane protein with its NH2-terminal DNA-binding domain facing the cytosol and its COOH terminus in the ER lumen (8Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). In response to ER stress, the cytosolic domain of ATF6 is cleaved off and translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of ER stress target genes (7Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T.

Overexpression of the active nuclear form of ATF6 is sufficient for transcriptional induction of GRP78 and transcription factors Gadd153 and XBP-1 (7Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K.

The third mechanism contributing to transcriptional regulation by ER stress involves the transcription factor ATF4, another ATF/cAMP-response element-binding protein family member. Its expression is regulated via the PERK/eIF2α pathway as discussed below. Like ATF6, ATF4 plays an important role in the activation of CHOP/Gadd153 (17Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol.

Repression of protein synthesis in response to ER stress is mediated through the increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), a modification that interferes with the formation of an active 43 S translation-initiation complex (19Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α during ER stress is carried out by the pancreatic eIF2α kinase (PEK or PERK), which is activated as part of the unfolded protein response (20Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar, 21Sood R. Porter A.C. Ma K. Quilliam L.A. Wek R.C. Biochem.

In addition to PERK, three other eukaryotic protein kinases are known to phosphorylate eIF2α, each of which responds to distinct stress signals. These include the heme-regulated inhibitory kinase, which phosphorylates eIF2α in response to heme depletion (23Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 24Han A.P. Yu C. Lu L. Fujiwara Y. Browne C. Chin G. Fleming M. Leboulch P. Orkin S.H. Chen J.J.

Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the interferon-induced protein kinase (PKR), which is activated by dsRNA produced during viral infection (27Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 28Samuel C.E. Kuhen K.L. George C.X. Ortega L.G. Rende-Fournier R. Tanaka H. Int. J. Hematol. 1997; 65: 227-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PERK, like IRE1, is a transmembrane protein, comprised of a cytoplasmic domain possessing kinase function and a stress-sensing lumenal domain (20Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). PERK and IRE1 are activated through a similar mechanism involving oligomerization and autophosphorylation (1Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar, 2Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although PERK-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation leads to a general suppression of translation, it promotes the preferential translation of certain mRNAs. Most notable among these is the transcription factor ATF4 (18Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). Genome-wide expression analysis using DNA microarrays has revealed that activation of the UPR in yeast results in the up-regulation of more than 350 genes. These include genes involved in various aspects of the secretory pathway, such as protein folding, ER to Golgi vesicular transport, and ER-associated protein degradation (22Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Although many of the molecular details of the UPR have been conserved in yeast and mammalian systems, the scope of UPR outputs in the mammalian cell is more complex and diverse. Accordingly, it is likely to involve a greater number of proteins and gene expression changes than seen in yeast. The present study utilized DNA microarray analysis to search for novel genes induced by ER stress in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We report here the identification of P58IPK, an inhibitor of the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), as a gene whose expression is up-regulated in response to ER stress. Additional studies provide evidence that ATF6 contributes to the induction of P58IPK and P58IPK plays a role in regulating the activity of the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 pathway. MEFs, human embryo kidney fibroblasts (HEK-293), and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin (Invitrogen) per ml, and were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Recombinant DNA techniques were performed by standard procedures. Plasmid pCGN-atf6 was kindly provided by Dr. R. Prywes (Columbia University) and used to constructpCGN-p50atf6 by inserting a PCR fragment spanning the NH2-terminal 1–373 amino acids of atf6, followed by a stop codon into the XbaI and BamHI sites of the pCGN vector. HEK-293 and HeLa cells were grown to 60% confluency in 100-mm plates and transfected using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Six μg ofpCGN-p50atf6,pCDNA3-atf4 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Leiden, University of Chicago),pCDNA1-p58 IPK (kindly provided by Dr. M. G. Katze, University of Washington), pcDNA-perk(kindly provided by Dr. D. Ron, New York University School of Medicine), or an empty vector were transfected per plate. Tunicamycin and thapsigargin were from Sigma. Whole cell lysate protein aliquots (20–30 μg) were size-fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by standard techniques. Blots were hybridized with the following antibodies: monoclonal anti-P58IPK (gift from Dr. M. G. Katze, University of Washington), polyclonal anti-Gadd153 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal anti-ATF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), monoclonal anti-KDEL (Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada), polyclonal anti-eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), polyclonal anti-phospho-eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), polyclonal anti-phospho-PERK (Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-PKR (Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-phospho-PKR (Cell Signaling Technology), monoclonal anti-cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling Technology), polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology), monoclonal anti-myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Abcam Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Proteins signals were detected by using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence ReagentPlus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To analyze RNA expression by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), total RNA from each sample was treated with DNase I and used for RT-PCR with SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with the Platinum Taq system (Invitrogen). The primers for gene-specific RT-PCR analysis were as follows: for P58IPK, GAGGTTTGTGTTGGGATGCAG (5′) and GCTCTTCAGCTGACTCAATCAG (3′); for ATF4, AGGAGTTCGCCTTGGATGCCCTG (5′) and AGTGATATCCACTTCACTGCCCAG (3′); for ATF6, ATCAGTTTACAACCTGCACCCAC (5′) and CTGTCTCCTTAGCACAGCAATATC (3′); for Gadd153, CTGAGTCATTGCCTTTCTCTTCG (5′) and CTCTGACTGGAATCTGGAGAGTG (3′); GAPDH, ACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCAGG (5′) and CTCTTGCTCTCAGATCCTTGCTGG (3′). Equal aliquots of the PCR products were electrophoresed through 2% agarose gels. For Northern blot analysis, 4-μg aliquots of total RNA (harvested using Nucleo Spin RNAII kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA)) were run on agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred onto GeneScreen Plus membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). cDNAs corresponding toatf4, gadd153, and grp78 (a generous gift from Amy S. Lee), were labeled by the random primer method and used to detect corresponding mRNAs on Northern blots. An end-labeled 24-bp oligonucleotide complementary to 18 S rRNA (ACGGTATCTGATCGTCTTCGAACC) was used as a probe to verify RNA integrity and loading differences. Total RNA was extracted from all samples using a NucleoSpin RNAII kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Atlas Human 1.2 K filters (www.Clontech) each containing 1174 genes were used. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse transcribed and labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Clontech cDNA array labeling kit. Hybridizations and washes were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. The cDNA array membranes were visualized for analysis by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and were quantitated as described (31Mayne M. Cheadle C. Soldan S.S. Cermelli C. Yamano Y. Akhyani N. Nagel J.E. Taub D.D. Becker K.G. Jacobson S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11641-11650Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). DAPI staining was performed as described previously (24Han A.P. Yu C. Lu L. Fujiwara Y. Browne C. Chin G. Fleming M. Leboulch P. Orkin S.H. Chen J.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6909-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In brief, prior to staining, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. DAPI was added to the fixed cells for 30 min, after which they were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified by condensation and fragmentation of nuclei. Percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the ratio of apoptotic cells to total cells counted ×100. A minimum of 400 cells were counted for each treatment. Twenty-one nucleotide double-stranded RNAs were transcribed in vitro using the SilencerTM siRNA construction kit according to the manufacturer instructions (Ambion Inc.). The targeting sequence of human P58IPK (accession number U28424), corresponding to nucleotide positions 137–157 (coding region), was AATTACTTGCAGCTGGACAGC. An siRNA targeting the luciferase mRNA (accession number X65324) served as a control. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates on the day before transfection at a concentration of 105 cells per well. Cells were transfected with OligofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, Opti-MEM (165 μl) was mixed with 20 μl of 1 μm siRNA duplex. In a separate tube, 12 μl of Opti-MEM I was incubated with 3 μl of OligofectAMINE for 5 min at room temperature. The two mixtures were combined, gently mixed, and incubated for another 20 min at room temperature. The entire mixture was added to the cells in 0.8 ml of 10% fetal bovine serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics. Cells were assayed at different time intervals after transfection. Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 105 cells per well. Twenty-four h following P58IPK siRNA transfection, cells were placed for 30 min in methionine-free minimal essential medium (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), and labeled by addition of [35S]methionine (20 μCi/ml; 1,000 Ci/mmol;Amersham Biosciences) to the culture medium for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). The protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein DC assay kit. The [35S]methionine incorporation was measured by cold trichloroacetic acid precipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For trichloroacetic acid precipitation, equal amounts of protein were added to 0.5 ml of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin containing 0.02% sodium azide and placed on ice. Ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid (0.5 ml) was added and samples were vortexed vigorously and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cell suspensions were filtered through glass microfiber discs (Whatman). Discs were washed three times with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and twice with 100% ethanol, after which they were air-dried, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. We sought to investigate the UPR stress response in mammalian cells by assessing changes in gene expression profiles after ER stress using the Atlas cDNA Gene Array (Clontech). This array contains cDNAs for 1174 genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle control, stress responses, transcription, and signaling. Total RNA was isolated from MEFs that were either left untreated or treated for 6 h with 2 μg/ml tunicamycin, an agent that causes ER stress by inhibiting proteinN-glycosylation. Analysis of the resulting signals on cDNA arrays (carried out as described under “Materials and Methods”) revealed 19 candidate genes whose expression was increased in response to tunicamycin treatment. Among these were a number of genes previously shown to play a role in the UPR response, includinggrp78, gadd153, and erp72. One novel gene whose expression was significantly elevated in MEFs following ER stress was p58 IPK, an established inhibitor of the eIF2α kinase PKR, a kinase related to the ER-specific kinase, PERK (Fig. 1 A). Hence, we further investigated the regulation of p58 IPK by ER stress and examined its potential role during the UPR response. To validate the findings obtained by microarray analysis,p58 IPK expression levels in MEFs and HEK-293 cells were examined using RT-PCR after treatment with either tunicamycin or thapsigargin (another ER stress agent that inhibits ER Ca2+-ATPase, thereby causing ER stress through a different mechanism). As shown, p58 IPK mRNA levels increased in both cell lines in response to each ER stress agent in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Further characterization of the response was carried out through kinetic analysis of P58IPK protein expression by Western blot analysis. As depicted in Fig. 1 C, P58IPK protein levels similarly increased following treatment with tunicamycin in both cell lines (Fig. 1 C). Because ATF4 and ATF6 are known to play a role in the transcriptional activation of ER stress-inducible genes, we examined their contribution to the induction of p58 IPK expression. To investigate the potential role of ATF6, we transfected HEK-293 cells with a plasmid that expresses p50 ATF6 (the soluble form of ATF6, capable of translocating into the nucleus). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and p58 IPK mRNA was examined using RT-PCR (Fig. 2). Overexpression of p50 ATF6 alone in HEK-293 cells resulted in up-regulation of the p58 IPK mRNA, even in the absence of ER stress. In contrast, overexpression of full-length ATF4 alone did not alter p58 IPK mRNA expression. To ensure that the ATF4 construct was functional in this assay, we also analyzed expression of gadd153, an established transcriptional target of both ATF4 and ATF6. gadd153mRNA was induced similarly by ectopically overexpressed p50 ATF6 and ATF4, indicating that the ATF4 construct was functional. These observations indicate that p58 IPK is a novel target of the ATF6, but not ATF4 pathway. To gain a better understanding of the biological role of P58IPK in the UPR, we tried to generate stable cell lines overexpressing P58IPK using both HEK-293 and HeLa cells. Despite our best efforts, no stable P58IPK-overexpressing clones could be obtained (data not shown). As an alternative strategy, we transiently transfected a plasmid expressing P58IPK into HeLa cells, where high transfection efficiencies could be achieved. ER stress is known to induce translational repression, which is mediated by phosphorylation of eIF2α. Phosphorylation of eIF2α leads to down-regulation of translation initiation through a well characterized mechanism involving inhibition of eIF2β activity (32Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P58IPK is a known inhibitor of the eIF2α kinase PKR, and it has been shown that overexpression of P58IPK can inhibit dsRNA-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α by PKR. Because ER stress leads to elevated P58IPK expression, we hypothesized that P58IPK might affect the eIF2α phosphorylation during the UPR. To address this possibility HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a P58IPK expression vector or empty vector (Fig. 3 A). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were treated with tunicamycin, and protein lysates were analyzed for both eIF2α phosphorylation and total eIF2α protein levels by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.3 B, overexpression of P58IPK significantly attenuated tunicamycin-induced eIF2α phosphorylation. Given that elevated P58IPK expression decreased the phosphorylation levels of eIF2α, we sought to analyze the levels of ATF4, a downstream target of this pathway, and Gadd153, whose expression is in turn regulated (at least in part) by ATF4. P58IPK overexpression profoundly inhibited ATF4 protein accumulation in tunicamycin-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 3 C), consistent with previous reports showing that the production of ATF4 protein requires eIF2α phosphorylation (18Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). Gadd153 protein induction in the P58IPK overexpressed cells was ∼70% of that seen in control cells after 4–6 h treatment with tunicamycin (Fig. 3 C). Previous reports have shown that P58IPK can protect cells from dsRNA or tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis. We were therefore interested in determining whether P58IPK could protect cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis. HeLa cells transiently transfected with either a p58 IPK -containing expression vector or an empty vector were treated with tunicamycin for different time periods and then analyzed for apoptosis. A hallmark of apoptosis is cleavage of the nuclear 116-kDa PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) protein to an 85-kDa inactive polypeptide. Inactivation of PARP through proteolytic cleavage facilitates chromosomal DNA fragmentation as part of the cellular apoptotic program (33Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). Our results show that the tunicamycin-induced PARP proteolysis was similar in vector and P58IPK-transfected HeLa cells (Fig.3 D). DAPI staining revealed a similar pattern of condensed and fragmented nuclei for both the control and P58IPK-transfected cells (Fig. 3 E). Taken together, these results suggest that under the conditions utilized here, overexpression of P58IPK does not alter the apoptotic response to ER stress. Whereas elevated P58IPK expression failed to alter the cellular outcome following ER stress, it remained possible that a reduction in P58IPK could influence the response. We decided to employ the RNA interference technique to address this possibility. A small inhibitory double-stranded RNA homologous to a 21-nucleotide sequence unique to the human P58IPK was used to reduce P58IPK expression. As shown in Fig.4 A, transfection of HeLa or HEK-293 cells with P58IPK siRNA resulted in a reduction of P58IPK protein levels, although control transfections with siRNA specific for luciferase, carried out in parallel, showed no effect on P58IPK expression. These observations indicate that the P58IPK siRNA treatment specifically reduced the abundance of P58IPK protein. Approximately 28 h after transfection with the P58IPKsiRNA duplex, we observed that many cells showed reduced ability to adhere to the plate and floated in the medium. To determine whether silencing P58IPK causes cell death, we examined the cell growth and viability of P58IPK siRNA-transfected cells. Cells transfected with the control siRNA grew very well. By contrast, cells transfected with P58IPK siRNA showed a marked reduction in viability (Fig. 4 B). Caspase-3 is one of the key executioners of apoptosis, being responsible either partially or totally for the proteolytic cleavage of many key proteins such as the nuclear enzyme PARP. Activation of caspase-3 requires the proteolytic processing of its inactive zymogen into activated p17 and p12 subunits. Cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP can be detected by Western blot analysis and was apparent 20 h after transfection of P58IPKsiRNA in HeLa cells, whereas no caspase-3 or PARP cleavage were detected in the control cells (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that silencing P58IPK decreases viability by causing apoptotic cell death. Because overexpression of P58IPK can inhibit eIF2α phosphorylation, we postulated that silencing of P58IPKwould induce eIF2α phosphorylation and inhibit protein translation. To determine the effect of P58IPK siRNA on eIF2α phosphorylation, HeLa and HEK-293 cells were transfected with the control siRNA or P58IPK siRNA and 20 h post-transfection, protein lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 5 A). The results show that P58IPK siRNA treatment markedly increased the level of eIF2α phosphorylation compared with control transfected cells. To further establish th"

Here, we provide evidence that tyrosine kinase Src is directly associated with Akt through the interaction between its SH3 domain and a conserved proline-rich motif (PXXP) in the C-terminal regulatory region of Akt. Substitution of the proline residues Pro-424 and Pro-427 by alanines results in loss of Akt activity and phosphorylation induced by the epidermal growth factor (EGF), possibly because these mutations disrupt the interaction between Akt and the SH3 domain of Src. This possibility is corroborated by our observation that the Akt mutant lacking these two prolines fails to bind to Src both in vivo and in vitro. We also showed that phosphorylation of Tyr-315 in Akt induced by Src or EGF is dependent on the integrity of this proline-rich motif. Furthermore, the Akt mutant lacking this proline motif fails to block the transcription activity of Forkhead in 293 cells and poorly stimulates the proliferation of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Taken together, our data suggest that the interaction between the SH3 domain of Src family kinases and the proline-rich motif in the C-terminal regulatory region of Akt is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt and its subsequent activation. It is noteworthy that this PXXP motif is conserved throughout several members of AGC kinase family, implying that association of this motif with the SH3 domain of an upstream regulator may represent a general mechanism applicable to these kinases as well.

Given its critical role in physiological response as well as in malignant transformation, the mechanisms underlying Akt activation are of great interest. Akt belongs to the AGC protein kinase family. Structural analysis showed that Akt contains an N-terminal PH1 domain, a central catalytic domain, and a C-terminal regulatory region. The intact PH domain is essential for activation of Akt. Upon growth factor stimulation, binding of the PH domain to the secondary messenger, PIP3, mediates translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane and the conformational change, which renders the kinase accessible to its upstream kinases such as PDK1 and Src (4Datta K.

Chem. 2002; PubMed Google Scholar). As a conserved feature shared by members of AGC protein kinase family, full activation of Akt requires phosphorylation at Thr-308 in the activation loop and Ser-473 in the C-terminal regulatory domain (2Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 9Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B.

Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of Akt at several tyrosine residues is also involved in the regulation of Akt activation (7Chen R. Kim O. Yang J. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J. Chen H. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31858-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Marmy-Conus N. Hannan K.M. Cristiano B.E. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, protein-protein interaction between signaling molecules and Akt, especially at its C-terminal regulatory region, plays important roles in regulation of its activity. The turn motif of the AGC family kinase is reported to provide a binding site for HSP70, which may stabilize the kinase and allow it to be re-activated (11Gao T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31585-31592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The C-terminal modulator protein (CTMP), a recently identified negative regulator of Akt, is also associated with Akt at the C-terminal region encompassing amino acids 411–480 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (12Maira S.M. Galetic I. Brazil D.P. Kaech S. Ingley E. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. Science. 2001; 294: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These observations suggest an essential role for the C-terminal regulatory region in mediating interaction of Akt with key regulatory molecules during its activation process. It is noteworthy that there are several proline-rich “patches” in the C-terminal region that may potentially serve as protein-protein interaction site(s). However, their functional implications still remain elusive.In this report, we show that a conserved SH3-domain binding motif (PXXP), located in the C-terminal regulatory region of Akt, is involved in the interaction between Akt and its upstream tyrosine kinase Src and is essential for Akt activation in response to growth factors. Mutation of this motif in Akt dramatically diminished its interaction with Src, which seems to be required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt and its subsequent activation by other upstream kinases such as PDK1. Our data further demonstrated the important role of the C-terminal regulatory domain and the direct involvement of Src family kinases in the regulation of Akt activity.RESULTSAlignments of the C-terminal regulatory region of Akt kinases from various organisms revealed an evolutionarily conserved SH3 domain-binding motif, PXXP, encompassing the residues 424–427 (Fig. 1 A). To test whether this proline-rich motif is of functional importance, we substituted both proline residues (Pro-424 and Pro-427) with alanines. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the P424A/P427A mutant failed to respond to EGF stimulation, as evidenced by its lack of phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 as well as in vitro kinase activity using H2B as a substrate. These data suggest that the integrity of this proline-rich motif is essential for Akt activity induced by growth factors. We further examined the effects of the mutation of these two proline residues on Akt activation induced by Src, which contains an SH3 domain and can potentially interact with the PXXP motif in Akt. Fig. 1 C shows that mutation of Pro-424 and Pro-427 abolished the activation of Akt induced by a constitutively active Src527F. These results prompted us to test whether Src is physically associated with Akt upon growth factor stimulation. As shown in Fig.2 A, we were able to detect the co-precipitation of endogenous Akt with Src in human prostate cancer cell PC3 cells after 5 min of treatment with EGF. This interaction seemed to be transient and peaked at 15 min of treatment and decayed rapidly at 30 min. Similar results were also obtained in COS1 cells. To further confirm this interaction, c-Src and Akt were co-expressed in COS1 cells, and immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-Src antibody followed by Western blotting with an anti-Akt antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 B, in the presence of serum wild-type Akt was efficiently co-precipitated with Src, but the mutant Akt was not, suggesting that Akt is associated with Src and that this interaction depends on the PXXP motif. These results are further supported by the following GST pull-down experiments. GST·Akt or its mutant, P424A/P427A, was immobilized to glutathione beads and then mixed with the cell extracts from COS1 cells overexpressing c-Src. In Fig. 2 C, we showed that c-Src was only pulled down by the wild-type Akt but not the P424A/P427A mutant. These data suggest that the PXXP motif could serve as a binding site for the SH3 domain of Src, and such an interaction seems to be required for Akt activation by Src as shown above. The interaction between Akt and the Src SH3 domain appeared to be specific, because no detectable association of Akt with the SH3 domain of p130Cas was observed (data not shown).Figure 2Interaction between the proline-rich motif of Akt and the SH3 domain of Src. a, co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Akt with Src upon EGF-treatment. PC3 and COS1 cells were serum starved overnight and followed by treatment with EGF for the indicated time.

We would like to know whether the interaction between Src and Akt could be a prerequisite step for phosphorylating Akt by Src. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the mutation of Pro-424 and Pro-427 dramatically diminished the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt induced by Src. These results are further confirmed by using an antibody specific for phosphorylated Tyr-315. Similar results were also obtained when the cells were stimulated with EGF (Fig. 3 B). To understand the relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation and Ser/Thr phosphorylation of Akt during its activation, we also examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt derivatives containing two major Ser/Thr phosphorylation site mutations. As shown in Fig 2 C, phosphorylation of Tyr-315 was readily detected in wild-type Akt, Akt T308A, and Akt S473A in EGF-treated or Src527F-contransfected cells. This suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr-315 may be prior to and independent of the phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473. Taken together, these observations allow us to conclude that the interaction between the PXXP motif of Akt with the SH3 domain of Src family kinases is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt and its subsequent activation by other upstream kinases.Figure 3The proline-rich motif is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt. a, mutation of the proline-rich motif diminishes tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt. HA-tagged wild type Akt or Akt P424A/P427A were cotransfected with Src527F into COS1 cells. The cells were serum starved, and immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-HA antibody.

Fig.4 A shows that co-transfection of wild-type Akt with FKHR into 293 cells dramatically inhibited FKHR activity as evidenced by a marked reduction of the luciferase activity under the control of a promoter containing three copies of the FKHR recognition motif IRS. The mutant Akt P424A/P427/A virtually lost its inhibitory effect on FKHR, which is consistent with its lack of kinase activity in the in vitro kinase assays. As another functional assay, we also examined the effects of the mutation of this proline-rich motif on cell proliferation. As shown in Fig.4 B, overexpression of constitutively active myr Akt in MDCK cells resulted in 2-fold increase in cell proliferation, whereas its derivative containing P424A/P427A mutations had very little effect. Our data suggest that the integrity of this proline-rich motif is required for its biological functions.Figure 4The proline-rich motif is required for the biological functions of Akt. a, mutation of the proline-rich motif attenuated the inhibitory effects of Akt on FKHR transcription activity. 293 cells were transfected with 3XIRS-luc, FLAG-tagged FKHR, pRL-TK, and HA-tagged Akt or its mutants.

In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, that a PXXP motif, which is evolutionarily conserved in Akt kinases among organisms from Caenorhabditis elegans to human, plays a crucial role in regulating Akt activity. This PXXP motif is located in the C-terminal regulatory region of Akt. When it is mutated, Akt is no longer activated by EGF. Because phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 is necessary for Akt activation, we then examined the effects of the mutation of the PXXP element on the phosphorylation state of these two critical sites. As expected, EGF failed to induce phosphorylation of either site. According to the current model of Akt activation, translocation of Akt from cytosol to the plasma membrane is required for its phosphorylation by upstream kinases. The loss of response of the mutant to growth factors may result from incapability of translocation to the plasma membrane, because the interaction between proline-rich motif and SH3 domain has been implicated in plasma membrane localization of some proteins (17de Mendez I.

However, we found that the mutant Akt P424A/P427A can still be efficiently recruited to the plasma membrane as the wild-type (data not shown). These data suggested that this PXXP element regulates Akt activation through mechanisms other than affecting its recruitment to plasma membrane. Recently, we and others have reported that, in addition to phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473, tyrosine phosphorylation is also implicated in the regulation of Akt activation (7Chen R. Kim O.

Cristiano B.E. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous study, we provided evidence showing that Src directly regulates Akt activity by phosphorylating Tyr-315 and Tyr-326 in the activation loop of Akt. Because Src contains an SH3 domain, it is likely that Src could potentially interact with the PXXP motif in Akt. In this report, we showed that endogenous Akt is associated with Src in response to EGF. Such interaction was confirmed by both in vivo and in vitro binding assays. As expected, the mutation of the PXXP motif markedly reduced the amount of Src associated with Akt. This indicated that binding of the PXXP motif on Akt and the SH3 domain of Src plays a major role in mediating their interaction. We then demonstrated that this interaction could be a prerequisite for the Src family kinases to phosphorylate the two critical tyrosine residues in the activation loop of Akt, because replacement of the two proline residues with alanines dramatically blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Tyr-315 was also significantly reduced. Furthermore, we showed that that EGF- or Src527F-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-315 is not affected in Akt T308A or Akt S473A, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt may occur prior to serine/threonine phosphorylation, at least in COS1 cells. The interaction between Akt and Src is functionally important because the mutant Akt P424A/P427A failed to inhibit FKHR transcriptional activity and can hardly stimulate cell proliferation. Our data are consistent with the model in which Akt translocates to the plasma membrane through the binding of its PH domain to the second messenger PIP3 generated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, where Akt meets with membrane-bound Src via the interaction between its PXXP motif in the C-terminal regulatory region and the SH3 domain of Src. This allows Src family kinase(s) to phosphorylate Akt at Tyr-315 and Tyr-326, which is followed by phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 and Ser-473 by other upstream kinases such as PDK1. Our results further support the notion that Src family tyrosine kinases can directly regulate Akt activity in concert with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and PDK1. Most intriguingly, this PXXP motif is conserved throughout several members of the AGC kinase family including protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and S6K, suggesting that the association of this motif with its recognition domain in the corresponding upstream regulator may be a general mechanism applicable to these kinases. Serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) is a key regulator in a variety of cellular processes including apoptosis, proliferation, intermediary metabolism, and response to inflammatory agents (1Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: PE1PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 3Galetic I. Andjelkovic M.

Given its critical role in physiological response as well as in malignant transformation, the mechanisms underlying Akt activation are of great interest. Akt belongs to the AGC protein kinase family. Structural analysis showed that Akt contains an N-terminal PH1 domain, a central catalytic domain, and a C-terminal regulatory region. The intact PH domain is essential for activation of Akt. Upon growth factor stimulation, binding of the PH domain to the secondary messenger, PIP3, mediates translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane and the conformational change, which renders the kinase accessible to its upstream kinases such as PDK1 and Src (4Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.I. Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Datta K. Bellacosa A.

Chem. 2002; PubMed Google Scholar). As a conserved feature shared by members of AGC protein kinase family, full activation of Akt requires phosphorylation at Thr-308 in the activation loop and Ser-473 in the C-terminal regulatory domain (2Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 9Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B.

Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of Akt at several tyrosine residues is also involved in the regulation of Akt activation (7Chen R. Kim O. Yang J. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J. Chen H. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31858-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Marmy-Conus N. Hannan K.M. Cristiano B.E. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, protein-protein interaction between signaling molecules and Akt, especially at its C-terminal regulatory region, plays important roles in regulation of its activity. The turn motif of the AGC family kinase is reported to provide a binding site for HSP70, which may stabilize the kinase and allow it to be re-activated (11Gao T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31585-31592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The C-terminal modulator protein (CTMP), a recently identified negative regulator of Akt, is also associated with Akt at the C-terminal region encompassing amino acids 411–480 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (12Maira S.M. Galetic I. Brazil D.P. Kaech S. Ingley E. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. Science. 2001; 294: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These observations suggest an essential role for the C-terminal regulatory region in mediating interaction of Akt with key regulatory molecules during its activation process. It is noteworthy that there are several proline-rich “patches” in the C-terminal region that may potentially serve as protein-protein interaction site(s). However, their functional implications still remain elusive. In this report, we show that a conserved SH3-domain binding motif (PXXP), located in the C-terminal regulatory region of Akt, is involved in the interaction between Akt and its upstream tyrosine kinase Src and is essential for Akt activation in response to growth factors. Mutation of this motif in Akt dramatically diminished its interaction with Src, which seems to be required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt and its subsequent activation by other upstream kinases such as PDK1. Our data further demonstrated the important role of the C-terminal regulatory domain and the direct involvement of Src family kinases in the regulation of Akt activity. RESULTSAlignments of the C-terminal regulatory region of Akt kinases from various organisms revealed an evolutionarily conserved SH3 domain-binding motif, PXXP, encompassing the residues 424–427 (Fig. 1 A). To test whether this proline-rich motif is of functional importance, we substituted both proline residues (Pro-424 and Pro-427) with alanines. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the P424A/P427A mutant failed to respond to EGF stimulation, as evidenced by its lack of phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 as well as in vitro kinase activity using H2B as a substrate. These data suggest that the integrity of this proline-rich motif is essential for Akt activity induced by growth factors. We further examined the effects of the mutation of these two proline residues on Akt activation induced by Src, which contains an SH3 domain and can potentially interact with the PXXP motif in Akt. Fig. 1 C shows that mutation of Pro-424 and Pro-427 abolished the activation of Akt induced by a constitutively active Src527F. These results prompted us to test whether Src is physically associated with Akt upon growth factor stimulation. As shown in Fig.2 A, we were able to detect the co-precipitation of endogenous Akt with Src in human prostate cancer cell PC3 cells after 5 min of treatment with EGF. This interaction seemed to be transient and peaked at 15 min of treatment and decayed rapidly at 30 min. Similar results were also obtained in COS1 cells. To further confirm this interaction, c-Src and Akt were co-expressed in COS1 cells, and immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-Src antibody followed by Western blotting with an anti-Akt antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 B, in the presence of serum wild-type Akt was efficiently co-precipitated with Src, but the mutant Akt was not, suggesting that Akt is associated with Src and that this interaction depends on the PXXP motif. These results are further supported by the following GST pull-down experiments. GST·Akt or its mutant, P424A/P427A, was immobilized to glutathione beads and then mixed with the cell extracts from COS1 cells overexpressing c-Src. In Fig. 2 C, we showed that c-Src was only pulled down by the wild-type Akt but not the P424A/P427A mutant. These data suggest that the PXXP motif could serve as a binding site for the SH3 domain of Src, and such an interaction seems to be required for Akt activation by Src as shown above. The interaction between Akt and the Src SH3 domain appeared to be specific, because no detectable association of Akt with the SH3 domain of p130Cas was observed (data not shown).Our previous study showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-315 and Tyr-326 by Src plays an important role in the regulation of Akt activity (7Chen R.

We would like to know whether the interaction between Src and Akt could be a prerequisite step for phosphorylating Akt by Src. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the mutation of Pro-424 and Pro-427 dramatically diminished the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt induced by Src. These results are further confirmed by using an antibody specific for phosphorylated Tyr-315. Similar results were also obtained when the cells were stimulated with EGF (Fig. 3 B). To understand the relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation and Ser/Thr phosphorylation of Akt during its activation, we also examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt derivatives containing two major Ser/Thr phosphorylation site mutations. As shown in Fig 2 C, phosphorylation of Tyr-315 was readily detected in wild-type Akt, Akt T308A, and Akt S473A in EGF-treated or Src527F-contransfected cells. This suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr-315 may be prior to and independent of the phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473.

Moreover, the phosphorylation of Tyr-315 was also significantly reduced. Furthermore, we showed that that EGF- or Src527F-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-315 is not affected in Akt T308A or Akt S473A, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt may occur prior to serine/threonine phosphorylation, at least in COS1 cells. The interaction between Akt and Src is functionally important because the mutant Akt P424A/P427A failed to inhibit FKHR transcriptional activity and can hardly stimulate cell proliferation. Our data are consistent with the model in which Akt translocates to the plasma membrane through the binding of its PH domain to the second messenger PIP3 generated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, where Akt meets with membrane-bound Src via the interaction between its PXXP motif in the C-terminal regulatory region and the SH3 domain of Src. This allows Src family kinase(s) to phosphorylate Akt at Tyr-315 and Tyr-326, which is followed by phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 and Ser-473 by other upstream kinases such as PDK1. Our results further support the notion that Src family tyrosine kinases can directly regulate Akt activity in concert with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and PDK1. Most intriguingly, this PXXP motif is conserved throughout several members of the AGC kinase family including protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and S6K, suggesting that the association of this motif with its recognition domain in the corresponding upstream regulator may be a general mechanism applicable to these kinases. Protein-protein interactions, which control the organization of the complex network of molecules involved in signal transduction, are mediated via interactions of various structure domains and their recognition motifs. In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, that a PXXP motif, which is evolutionarily conserved in Akt kinases among organisms from Caenorhabditis elegans to human, plays a crucial role in regulating Akt activity. This PXXP motif is located in the C-terminal regulatory region of Akt. When it is mutated, Akt is no longer activated by EGF. Because phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 is necessary for Akt activation, we then examined the effects of the mutation of the PXXP element on the phosphorylation state of these two critical sites. As expected, EGF failed to induce phosphorylation of either site. According to the current model of Akt activation, translocation of Akt from cytosol to the plasma membrane is required for its phosphorylation by upstream kinases. The loss of response of the mutant to growth factors may result from incapability of translocation to the plasma membrane, because the interaction between proline-rich motif and SH3 domain has been implicated in plasma membrane localization of some proteins (17de Mendez I.

However, we found that the mutant Akt P424A/P427A can still be efficiently recruited to the plasma membrane as the wild-type (data not shown). These data suggested that this PXXP element regulates Akt activation through mechanisms other than affecting its recruitment to plasma membrane. Recently, we and others have reported that, in addition to phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473, tyrosine phosphorylation is also implicated in the regulation of Akt activation (7Chen R. Kim O.

In our previous study, we provided evidence showing that Src directly regulates Akt activity by phosphorylating Tyr-315 and Tyr-326 in the activation loop of Akt. Because Src contains an SH3 domain, it is likely that Src could potentially interact with the PXXP motif in Akt. In this report, we showed that endogenous Akt is associated with Src in response to EGF. Such interaction was confirmed by both in vivo and in vitro binding assays. As expected, the mutation of the PXXP motif markedly reduced the amount of Src associated with Akt. This indicated that binding of the PXXP motif on Akt and the SH3 domain of Src plays a major role in mediating their interaction. We then demonstrated that this interaction could be a prerequisite for the Src family kinases to phosphorylate the two critical tyrosine residues in the activation loop of Akt, because replacement of the two proline residues with alanines dramatically blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt.

https://openalex.org/W1977165141,"Separase is a protease that triggers chromosome segregation at anaphase onset by cleaving cohesin, the chromosomal protein complex responsible for sister chromatid cohesion1,2. After anaphase, cells exit from mitosis; that is, they complete downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase activity, undergo cytokinesis and enter G1 of the next cell cycle. Here we show that separase activation at the onset of anaphase is sufficient to promote release from the nucleolus and activation of the budding yeast phosphatase, Cdc14, a key step in mitotic exit3,4,5. The ability of separase to activate Cdc14 is independent of its protease function but may involve promoting phosphorylation of the Cdc14 inhibitor Net1. This novel separase function is coregulated with its proteolytic activity by the separase inhibitor securin. This helps to explain the coupling of anaphase and mitotic exit — after securin degradation at anaphase onset, separase cleaves cohesin to trigger chromosome segregation and concurrently uses a non-proteolytic mechanism to initiate mitotic exit."

The present study was undertaken to clarify the osmoregulation mechanism of AQP1 in renal medullary cells. In cultured mouse medullary (mIMCD-3) cells, AQP1 expression was significantly induced by hypertonic treatment with impermeable solutes, whereas urea had no effect on AQP1 expression. This result indicates the requirement of a hypertonic gradient. Hypertonicity activated ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK in mIMCD-3 cells. Furthermore, all three MAPKs were phosphorylated by the upstream activation of MEK1/2, MKK3/6, and MKK4, respectively. The treatments with MEK inhibitor U0126, p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580, and JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly attenuated hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression in mIMCD-3 cells. In addition, hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression was significantly reduced by both the dominant-negative mutants of JNK1- and JNK2-expressing mIMCD-3 cells.

Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) was first discovered in human erythrocytes as a water channel for high osmotic water permeability (2Preston G.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11110-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 3Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). In addition to erythrocytes, AQP1 is abundantly present in the epithelium of kidney proximal tubules and descending thin limbs and endothelium of the descending vasa recta (4Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Agre P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). AQP1 has been suggested to be important in constitutive water reabsorption, especially in the epithelial cells of the renal medulla. The AQP1-expressing vasa recta of the renal medulla are critical in generating and maintaining an axial osmotic gradient through the medulla (5Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Kwon T. Fr℘kiaer J. Diseases of the Kidney and Urinary Tract. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 109-134Google Scholar). Sodium chloride (NaCl), urea, and water transporters in the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) all play an important role in the regulation of solute-free water excretion in the kidney. Although most cells in mammals are not normally stressed by hypertonicity, epithelial cells of the renal medulla are constantly subjected to a hypertonic condition. Specifically, as a consequence of the urinary concentrating mechanism, cells in the renal inner medulla are normally exposed to a variety of high concentrations of NaCl and urea. Hypertonicity, which results from a high concentration of salt and urea, provides a mechanical stress to shrink medullary cells. However, medullary cells adapt to hypertonicity by a variety of responses through an acute influx of NaCl and water (6Hoffmann E.K. Simonsen L.O. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 315-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), chronic accumulation of organic osmolytes (7Yancey P.H. Clarl M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3042) Google Scholar), and acute activation of immediate early and heat shock genes (8Cohen D. Wasserman J. Gullans S. Am. J.

Although the amounts of total RNA transcription, DNA synthesis, and protein synthesis are significantly decreased by hypertonicity, a limited number of genes are up-regulated by hypertonicity-induced transcription (10Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 11Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The cellular and molecular mechanisms of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) regulation via vasopressin in the collecting duct of the kidney are well understood (12Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Nature. 1993; 361: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 13Nielsen S. DiGiovanni S.R. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Harris H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 2000; 78: 1024-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the AQP1 regulation in the kidney is still unknown. Studies performed in the human primary proximal tubule epithelial cell (15Jenq W. Cooper D.R. Bittle P. Ramirez G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and mouse medullary cell line (mIMCD-3) (16Jenq W. Mathieson I.M. Ihara W. Ramirez G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) demonstrate that AQP1 mRNA and protein expressions were up-regulated by hypertonicity. It was also reported that the AQP1 transcript was up-regulated by a hypertonicity response element (HRE) in the promoter region of AQP1 gene that was located at −54 to −46, which responded to hypertonic stimulation (17Umenishi F. Schrier R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This HRE sequence is different from previously reported tonicity-responsive enhancer (TonE) consensus sequence, which is also responsible for hypertonicity. Additional studies in mIMCD-3 cells showed that all three MAPKs (ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK) were activated by hypertonicity (18Zhang Z. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1234-F1238PubMed Google Scholar, 19Berl T. Siriwardana G. Ao L. Butterfield L.M. Heasley L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F305-F311PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was possible that the osmoregulation of AQP1 may be mediated by MAPK pathways, which are induced by hypertonicity. However, the role of MAPKs in hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression remains unclear. The objective of the present study was to elicit the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression in renal medullary cells. We show here that hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression is mediated by the activation of the ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK pathways in mIMCD-3 cells. Functional analysis of the AQP1 promoter containing the HRE sequence also demonstrated that the AQP1 promoter activity was stimulated by hypertonicity and regulated by MAPK pathways. mIMCD-3 cells used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Total RNA was isolated from mIMCD-3 cells using a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed and then directly amplified by PCR using two sets of primers: AQP1 sense primer, 5′-CGGGCTGTCATGTACATCATCGCCCA-3′ (nucleotides 276–301); AQP1 antisense primer, 5′-CCCAATGAACGGCCCCACCCAGAAA-3′ (nucleotides 632–656); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense primer, 5′-ATGGGAAGCTTGTCATCAACGGGAA-3′ (nucleotides 184–208); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antisense primer, 5′-TGGCAGGTTTCTCCAGGCGGCACGT-3′ (nucleotides 729–753). The PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. mIMCD-3 cells grown on 6-cm dishes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm sucrose and homogenized by 10 passages through a 27-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was measured using the Bradford protein assay method (Bio-Rad protein assay kit). Protein (10 μg) from the cell extract was resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-human AQP1 antibody for 1 h. As a protein loading control, the membrane was also incubated with anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). For the analysis of MAPK signaling pathways, cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The lysates were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membranes were incubated with antibodies to phospho-ERK, ERK, phospho-p38, p38, phospho-JNK, JNK, phospho-mitogen-activated ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2, MEK1/2, phospho-MAPK kinase (MKK) 3/6, MKK3, phospho-MKK4 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA), or MKK4 (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). After washing, the membrane was incubated with anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The plasmid pCAT-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to examine the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region in the human AQP1 gene (17Umenishi F. Schrier R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Umenishi F. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1998; 47: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Umenishi F. Schrier R.W.

The AQP1 promoter construct (−54/+23; CP-54), which contains the HRE sequence, was generated by PCR and ligated into Hind III andXbaI sites of pCAT-basic vector. The sense primer corresponded to nucleotides −54 to −33 and contained an engineeredHind III restriction site. The antisense primer for amplification corresponded to nucleotides +23 to +4 and contained an engineered XbaI restriction site. The CAT construct was confirmed by sequence analysis. The transient transfection experiment was performed by the modification of previous reports (17Umenishi F. Schrier R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Umenishi F. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1998; 47: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Umenishi F. Schrier R.W.

Genomics. 1998; 50: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). mIMCD-3 cells were resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium without serum and transfected by electroporation under 300 V at 500 microfarads in a 0.4-mm cuvette. Each transfection was performed with 10 μg of the AQP1 promoter-CAT construct (CP-54) and 5 μg of the plasmid pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) on a total volume of 300 μl. After overnight incubation, cells were incubated with or without 100 mm NaCl. After a 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested, and cell extracts were isolated using the reporter lysis buffer (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in every experiment for normalization. CAT activity was measured usingd-threo[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Biosciences) and the phase extraction method. A previous study demonstrated that AQP1 expression was induced by hypertonic medium supplemented with NaCl in mouse renal medullary (mIMCD-3) cells (16Jenq W. Mathieson I.M. Ihara W. Ramirez G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To examine the hypertonic induction of AQP1 in mIMCD-3 cells, cells were incubated in medium supplemented with hyperosmotic agents (NaCl and urea) and impermeable osmolytes (raffinose, glucose, sucrose, and sorbitol). After the treatment with hyperosmolar medium, cell lysates were immunoblotted by using anti-AQP1 antibody. AQP1 protein expression was increased by NaCl, raffinose, glucose, sucrose, and sorbitol but not urea (Fig.1 A). These data indicate that AQP1 induction by hypertonicity requires a hypertonic gradient. Next, to investigate the time course for hypertonic induction of AQP1 protein, mIMCD-3 cells were incubated in hypertonic medium by the addition of 100 mm NaCl. Samples were harvested at specific times for immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 B, AQP1 protein significantly increased by 12 h after exposure to hypertonic medium and peaked at 16–20 h. To test the AQP1 induction in medium osmolality, cells were incubated in medium by the addition of NaCl, raffinose, or glucose with different hyperosmolality. A minimum addition of 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm raffinose, or 100 mm glucose to the medium was needed to increase AQP1 protein expression in mIMCD-3 cells, and stronger induction of AQP1 was obtained by the exposure to higher medium osmolality (Fig. 2). However, the addition of 200 mm raffinose to the medium showed much less AQP1 expression than that of 100 and 150 mm raffinose, because the cell viability significantly decreased at that condition. Taken together, these data indicate that AQP1 expression in mIMCD-3 cells is significantly increased in hypertonic condition in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression may be caused by mRNA induction or stability or protein stability. To distinguish the mechanism, cells were pretreated with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D or protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and then incubated under isotonic or hypertonic condition. The expression levels of AQP1 mRNA and protein were examined by reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblot analysis, respectively. As shown in Fig.3, pretreatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide completely inhibited NaCl-induced AQP1 mRNA and protein expressions. These results suggest that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations are required for AQP1 induction by hypertonicity. Previous works show that all three MAPKs (ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK) can be activated by hypertonicity (18Zhang Z. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1234-F1238PubMed Google Scholar, 19Berl T. Siriwardana G. Ao L. Butterfield L.M. Heasley L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F305-F311PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether MAPK-mediating signaling was involved in hypertonic induction of AQP1 in mIMCD-3 cells, antibodies specific for either the phosphorylated or total form of each of three MAPKs were used. Cells were treated with hyperosmotic condition containing 100 mmNaCl or 200 mm urea for 10 min, and then the phosphorylation of all three MAPKs were investigated by immunoblot analysis. NaCl significantly activated the ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK pathways in mIMCD-3 cells, whereas urea activated only the ERK pathway (Fig. 4). These data confirmed the results reported previously (18Zhang Z. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1234-F1238PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yang X.-Y. Zhang Z. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F176-F185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, activation of MAPKs is mediated by MEK or MKKs. ERK is activated by MEK1 and MEK2, whereas p38 kinase is activated by MKK3 and MKK6, and JNK is activated by MKK4 (24Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

To further investigate the differential activation of MAPKs in mIMCD-3 cells in response to hypertonicity, the phosphorylation for the upstream activation of MAPKs was assessed using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated or total form of MEK1/2, MKK3/6, or MKK4. As shown in Fig. 4, NaCl activated the MEK1/2, MKK3/6, and MKK4 pathways, whereas urea activated only the MEK1/2 pathway. Thus, NaCl significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of all three subfamilies of MAPKs in mIMCD-3 cells, but urea only the ERK phosphorylation. To determine whether the activation of ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK was involved in the regulation of hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression, a MEK inhibitor, U0126, a p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580, and a novel specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (29Bennett B.L.

To investigate the specificity of each MAPK inhibitor, mIMCD-3 cells were pretreated with the different concentrations of U0126, SB203580, or SP600125, and then NaCl-induced ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK phosphorylations were analyzed by immunoblot. As shown in Fig.5, all three MAPK inhibitors revealed the specific selectivity for other MAPKs within the range of a given concentration. On the basis of the result in Fig. 5, we proceeded to assess the effect of MAPK inhibitors on NaCl-induced AQP1 protein expression. Cells were pretreated with each MAPK inhibitor and stimulated with NaCl. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot. Results were normalized to expression of β-actin by densitometry of immunoblot (Fig.6). NaCl-induced AQP1 expression was significantly blocked by U0126 (0.5–2.5 μm), SB203580 (0.5–2.5 μm), and SP600125 (2–10 μm). The treatment of a higher concentration with each MAPK inhibitor almost completely abolished NaCl-induced AQP1 expression (data not shown). Therefore, this result provides that AQP1 induction by hypertonicity requires the activation of ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK pathways. As an alternative approach to the involvement of JNK pathway on hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression, mIMCD-3 cells were transiently cotransfected with the dominant-negative mutants of JNK1 (JNK1-DN) or JNK2 (JNK2-DN) and pSV-β-galactosidase plasmids. After 16 h of incubation without or with 100 mm NaCl, AQP1 protein expression was examined by immunoblot analysis. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in each experiment for correction of transfection efficiency. Results were normalized to expression of β-actin by densitometry of immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 7, NaCl-induced AQP1 expression was significantly reduced by both the JNK1-DN- and JNK2-DN-transfected mIMCD-3 cells. Taken together, the activation of ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK pathways is necessary for AQP1 up-regulation in mIMCD-3 cells that is responsible for hypertonicity. Our results demonstrated that both NaCl and urea activated the ERK pathway. To determine whether the ERK activation is sufficient to induce AQP1 expression, arginine vasopressin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate, or calcium ionophore (ionomycin), which are known as potent stimulators of ERK pathway, were tested. As shown in Fig.8 A, all three potent stimulators indeed activated the ERK pathway. However, they did not induce AQP1 protein expression under isotonic or hypertonic condition (Fig. 8 B). Therefore, the ERK activation is necessary but not sufficient to induce AQP1 expression by hypertonicity. Our previous study demonstrates that a novel HRE is present in the AQP1 promoter region, which is located in the region from −54 to −46 (17Umenishi F. Schrier R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This critical element responds to hypertonicity and is required for basal and hypertonicity-induced expression of the AQP1 gene. To investigate the involvement of ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK pathways in hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression at the transcriptional level, transient transfection experiments were performed using the AQP1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct CP-54 (−54/+23), which contains the HRE sequence. These results are showed in Fig.9. When cells were transfected with the CP-54, the treatment with NaCl led to an ∼3.4-fold increase in the promoter activity, whereas the treatment with urea did not. NaCl-induced promoter activity was attenuated in the presence of U0126, SB203580, and SP600125 in a dose-dependent manner. In cotransfection experiments, NaCl-induced promoter activity was significantly inhibited by the dominant-negative mutants of JNK1 (JNK1-DN) or JNK2 (JNK2-DN). These results indicate that the HRE in AQP1 promoter is essential for the hypertonicity-induced regulatory effects by ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK pathways on AQP1 expression. In the book From Fish to Philosopher, Smith suggests that the capacity to conserve solute-free water excretion by activating a urinary concentrating mechanism was an important factor in the evolution from fresh water fishes to land-dwelling mammals (31Smith H.W. From Fish to Philosopher: The Story of Our Internal Environment. Little, Brown, and Co., Boston, MA1951Google Scholar). Much has been learned about the mammalian urinary-concentrating mechanism, including the osmotic and non-osmotic release of the antidiuretic hormone, vasopressin (32Schrier R.W. Berl T. Anderson R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 236: F321-F322PubMed Google Scholar), the countercurrent concentrating and exchange mechanisms (33Berl T. Schrier R.W. Renal and Electrolyte Disorders. 6th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1997: 1-64Google Scholar), the cloning of the collecting duct vasopressin V2 receptor (34Birnbaumer M. Seibold A. Gilbert S. Ishido M. Barberis C. Antaramian A. Brabet P. Rosenthal W. Nature. 1992; 357: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), and most recently, the cloning of the renal water channels, termed aquaporins (35Knepper M.A. Wade J.B.

Although the up-regulation and trafficking to the collecting apical membrane of AQP2 is a critical factor in the urinary-concentrating mechanism (36Nielsen S. Chou C.-L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), there is recent evidence implicating an important role of AQP1. AQP1 resides in the proximal tubule, descending thin limb of Henle's loop and endothelial cells of the vasa recta (4Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Agre P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Mutations of the AQP1 gene both in knockout mice (37Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and humans (38King L.S. Choi M. Fernandez P.C. Cartron J.P. Agre P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) have been shown to exhibit a defect in maximal urinary concentrating capacity. A recent study shows that a hypertonic NaCl environment in mouse medullary cells is associated with an up-regulation of AQP1 (16Jenq W. Mathieson I.M. Ihara W. Ramirez G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this effect has, however, not been elucidated. Such an up-regulation of AQP1 protein expression would likely enhance the urinary concentrating mechanism, since mutations of AQP1 impair urinary concentration. The present study was undertaken to examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms on the effect of hypertonic stress to up-regulate AQP1 protein expression. The initial study was performed with mouse medullary (mIMCD-3) cells incubated in medium supplemented with hyperosmotic NaCl or urea as well as with medium containing impermeable osmolytes including raffinose, glucose, sucrose, and sorbitol. AQP1 protein expression was increased in medium containing all of these substrates except urea. Because urea crosses cell membrane freely and, thus, does not create an osmotic gradient, these results implicate a hypertonic gradient in this induction of AQP1 protein expression. Further studies demonstrated the time- and dose-dependent effects of the hypertonic gradient using NaCl, raffinose, or glucose to induce AQP1 protein expression. The actinomycin D and cycloheximide treatment experiments suggested the respective involvement of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations in hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression. A recent study demonstrated that AQP1 protein stability was crucial in AQP1 induction by hypertonicity in mouse BALB/c fibroblasts, which was mediated by the proteasome degradation pathway (39Leitch V. Agre P. King L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2894-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that AQP1 induction by hypertonicity occurs at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Hypertonicity activated all three MAPK signaling pathways (ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK) in mIMCD-3 cells. These signaling pathways were shown to mediate hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression. Specifically, it was demonstrated that the blockade of any one of ERK, p38 kinase, or JNK signaling pathway by a specific inhibitor significantly reduced hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression. U0126, SB203580, or SP600125 selectively inhibited the ERK, p38 kinase, or JNK pathway in a dose-dependent fashion, respectively. Interestingly, the partial ERK inhibition by SB203580 was observed at 5 μmbut not 2.5 μm (data not shown). The maximal dose used in the present study was 2.5 μm. The similar observation was previously reported by Yang et al. (23Yang X.-Y. Zhang Z. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F176-F185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggested a potential interrelationship between ERK and p38 kinase activation. Although SP600125, which was recently identified as a specific JNK inhibitor, blocked the JNK activation in a dose-dependent fashion, it has been demonstrated that this inhibitor also had a partial p38 inhibition at a concentration higher than the maximal dose used in the present study (29Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). It should be noted that mIMCD-3 cells are highly sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, we showed that the blockade of JNK pathway by dominant-negative mutants of JNK1 and JNK2 as an alternative approach significantly reduced hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that the activation of all three MAPK is indispensable for AQP1 induction by hypertonicity. In mIMCD-3 cells, although NaCl activated the ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK, urea activated only the ERK. Although both NaCl and urea activated the ERK, only NaCl induced AQP1 expression. Furthermore, other ERK stimulators such as arginine vasopressin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate, and ionomycin did not induce AQP1 expression under isotonic or hypertonic condition. These results indicate that the ERK activation is necessary but not sufficient to induce AQP1 expression by hypertonicity. A similar study also demonstrates that hypertonicity-induced AQP5 expression in mouse lung epithelial cells was mediated by the ERK-dependent pathway, although the ERK activation was not sufficient for AQP5 induction by hypertonicity (40Hoffert J.D. Leitch V. Agre P. King L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9070-9077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The detailed regulatory mechanism via MAPK pathways in hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression is still unclear. Our data suggest that the three MAPKs may be necessary to phosphorylate transcriptional factors that bind to hypertonicity-responsive elements in the AQP1 gene. The induction of AQP1 gene by hypertonicity results from a sequential MAPK-signaling pathway that directly affects the promoter region of AQP1 gene. Previous studies demonstrate that the genes of the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter (41Rim J.S. Atta M.G. Dahl S.C. Berry G.T. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20615-20621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), sodium/chloride/betaine cotransporter (42Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Chen C.P. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F753-F761PubMed Google Scholar), and aldose reductase (43Ferraris J.D. Burg M. Jung K.-Y. Bedford J.J. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18318-18321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) are up-regulated in response to hypertonicity. The tonicity responsive enhancer (TonE) consensus sequence present in these genes mediates the transcriptional stimulation. It seems that AQP1 induction by hypertonicity is mediated by an osmotic response element such as TonE. However, no TonE consensus sequence is present in a 1.8-kilobase AQP1 promoter region (20Umenishi F. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1998; 47: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We recently characterized a novel HRE in the AQP1 gene that is different from TonE consensus sequence (17Umenishi F. Schrier R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using the AQP1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct that contains the HRE sequence, we showed that any of three MAPK specific inhibitors and dominant-negative mutants of JNK1 or JNK2 significantly reduced NaCl-induced AQP1 promoter activity in a dose-response manner. In contrast, urea did not induce the promoter activity. In addition, the promoter activity was not affected by U0126, SB203580, or SP600125 under isotonic conditions. 2F. Umenishi and R. W. Schrier, unpublished observation. Thus, the novel HRE, which only responds to hypertonicity, is essential for the transcriptional regulation of hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression. Identification of a trans-acting HRE-binding protein that binds to the HRE should further elucidate the transcriptional regulation of hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression. In summary, the present results demonstrate that hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression is regulated by ERK, p38 kinase, and JNK activation and the HRE in the AQP1 promoter. Inhibition of each MAPK pathway results in significant reduction of hypertonicity-induced AQP1 expression, indicating that all three MAPK signaling pathways are indispensable for AQP1 induction.

Identification of the molecular basis of the increased thermostability of the proteins of such hyperthermophilic organisms is expected to help our understanding of protein folding as well as the design of enzymes retaining their activity at high temperatures (Ref. 1Kumar S. Nussinov R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1216-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar and references therein). In a previous comparative study, Cambillau and Claverie (2Cambillau C. Claverie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32383-32386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) found that a large difference between the proportions of charged (Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg) versus polar (non-charged) (Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr) amino acids (abbreviated asCvP1-bias) was the most prominent signature of the hyperthermophilic life style at the proteome level. This global CvP-bias was reflected in the amino acid composition of the water-accessible residues computed from an analysis of the surface of 131 mesophilic versus 58 hyperthermophilic proteins. Given the rapidly increasing number of fully sequenced microbial genomes (more than doubled since the initial study), inferences derived in the past from correlation studies on a limited set of examples are in constant danger of being proven wrong. Now the genomes of seven new thermophilic and hyperthermophile archaea and of three new thermophilic bacteria have been deciphered. Besides these thermophilic organisms, numerous new extremophile organisms, such as the halophilic archaea Halobacterium sp., the halophilic bacteriumSinorhizobium meliloti, and the alkaliphilic bacteriumBacillus halodurans have been added to the list,as well as a large number of mesophilic bacteria and archaea (Table I). With these new genomes from a wider evolutionary spectrum, any previously derived “life style” criterion is at risk of failure in the form of false positive (classifying a mesophile as hyperthermophile) or false negative (classifying an hyperthermophile as mesophile) predictions. In particular, the newly added extremophile sequence data allow us to investigate whether the bias in favor of charged rather than polar residues previously observed in the proteome of hyperthermophiles by Cambillau and Claverie (2Cambillau C. Claverie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32383-32386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) is truly specific to the adaptation in high temperatures or whether it could also be linked to other extreme environments.Table IProperties of the 71 genomes analyzed here, ranked by decreasing CvP biasProperties of the 71 genomes analyzed here, ranked by decreasingCvP bias (see “Materials and Methods” for details).

Mesophiles (OGT, <557) are highlighted in blue, thermophiles (OGT, <80°) in orange, and hyperthermophiles in red. This new body of sequence data also gives us an opportunity to reassess the conclusions of several other studies. By systematically comparing the archaeon Thermoplasma volcanium genomic sequence with seven other genomic sequences of archaea, all exhibiting higher optimal growth temperature (OGT), Kawashima et al. (3Kawashima T. Amano N. Koike H. Makino S. Higuchi S. Kawashima-Ohya Y. Watanabe K. Yamazaki M. Kanehori K. Kawamoto T. Nunoshiba T. Yamamoto Y. Aramaki H. Makino K. Suzuki M. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 14257-14262Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) identified a number of strong correlations between some characteristics of genome organization. For instance, they reported that theJ2 index (computed from the dinucleotide frequency, see “Materials and Methods”) was increasing together with the OGT. They also noticed some characteristic changes in the distribution of the isoelectric points (pI) of the proteins: with increasing OGT, the fraction of the basic protein subset (pI >7) becomes larger and with it the genome-average pI. In a different work, Kreil and Ouzounis (4Kreil D.P. Ouzounis C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) used hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis to identify the factors affecting the global amino acid composition of the predicted proteome of 6 thermophilic archaea, 2 thermophilic bacteria, 17 mesophilic bacteria, and 2 eukaryotic species. They concluded that the G + C content is indeed a dominant discriminating property but unrelated to any preference for a thermophilic lifestyle. They also noticed that thermophilic species could be identified by their global amino acid compositions alone, albeit without precisely defining the nature of this discriminating power. In this study, we applied a similar approach to a much larger genomic data set. This allows us to show that the most discriminating factor between hyperthermophile and mesophile genomes remains the absolute difference between the frequency of charged and polar amino acid residues (CvP-bias). Furthermore, we show that a high J2 index value is a necessary, but not sufficient, criterion for the recognition of a hyperthermophilic proteome, whereas the previously proposed genome-average pI is not a satisfactory correlate of hyperthermostability. A total of 71 fully sequenced genomes was analyzed (TableI), including 53 mesophiles (<50 °C) (50 bacteria, 3 archaea), 9 thermophiles (50–80 °C) (4 bacteria, 5 archaea), and 9 hyperthermophiles (>80 °C) (1 bacteria, 8 archaea). 69 of those genome sequences were downloaded from GenBankTM and 2 unfinished genomes, Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans andBacillus stearothermophilus, from the Institute for Genome Research (TIGR, Rockville, MD) and from the University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, respectively. The proteomes of the various organisms were defined according to the available open reading frame (ORF) annotation (when available in GenBankTM). For the two unfinished genomes, the proteomes were defined as the subsets of ORFs longer than 200 amino acids. Transmembrane segments were then predicted using the simple algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle (5Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar). For each organism, the “soluble” moiety of the proteome was then defined by discarding all proteins (ORFs) containing at least two predicted trans-membrane segments. The subsequent statistical analyses were all performed on these predicted soluble proteins. Following Kawashima et al. (3Kawashima T. Amano N. Koike H. Makino S. Higuchi S. Kawashima-Ohya Y. Watanabe K. Yamazaki M. Kanehori K. Kawamoto T. Nunoshiba T. Yamamoto Y. Aramaki H. Makino K. Suzuki M. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 14257-14262Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the genome sequences were used to compute the J2 index as:J2 = FYY +FRR − FYR −FRY where FYY designates the relative frequency of dinucleotides pyrimidine (TT, TC, CT, CC),FRR the relative frequency of purine dinucleotides (AA, AG, GA, GG), and FYR andFRY the corresponding mixed purine/pyrimidine combinations. Pure purine and pyrimidine dinucleotides were found to be more frequent than their mixed counterparts in hyperthermophilic Pyrococci (3Kawashima T. Amano N. Koike H. Makino S. Higuchi S. Kawashima-Ohya Y. Watanabe K. Yamazaki M. Kanehori K. Kawamoto T. Nunoshiba T. Yamamoto Y. Aramaki H. Makino K. Suzuki M. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 14257-14262Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The program “iep” from the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) was used to calculate the theoretical pI value for every soluble protein and, from those, the average pI for every genome. Principal component analysis was performed using the statistical package R. 71 genomes from meso-, thermo-, and hyperthermophilic organisms were included. When multiple genome sequences from closely related strains or species were available, only one of them was included in the analysis to avoid introducing a potential statistical bias. The computed amino acid compositions for 9 fully sequenced hyperthermophilic and 53 mesophilic bacteria and archaea are presented in Table I and Fig.1, a–c. The case of the 9 moderately thermophilic genomes will be discussed later. As previously observed by Cambillau and Claverie (Fig. 2 and a-c in Ref. 2Cambillau C. Claverie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32383-32386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) but now confirmed on a much larger data set, the proteins of hyperthermophiles exhibit a strong bias for the use of charged residues at the expense of polar residues. This includes strongly reduced frequencies for the thermolabile amino acid residues Gln and Asn, as also noted by Vieilleet al. (6Vieille C. Epting K.L. Kelly R.M. Zeikus J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6291-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Among other trends, the aliphatic residue Val appears to be preferred in hyperthermophiles, whereas the tiny non-polar non-charged residue Ala is avoided.Figure 2Biplot of a principal component analysis of the amino acid composition of all studied organisms.Blue dots identify mesophiles; orange dots identify thermophiles; red dots identify hyperthermophiles.Green vectors represent the position of the different amino acids in the biplot (only vectors with significant contributions to PCA components 1 and 2 are drawn).

Our PCA analysis (Fig.2) is consistent with earlier results obtained with a much smaller data set by Kreil and Ouzounis (4Kreil D.P. Ouzounis C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); 857 of the data variance is accounted by the first two principal components. The first component (727 of the variance) strongly correlates with the G + C content of the genomes (Fig.3a, r2= 0.94). The second component (137 of the variance) turns out to be the sole discriminating factor between meso- and hyperthermophilic lifestyles, correlating quite well with the optimal growth temperature (Fig. 3c, OGT, r2 = 0.72). All other PCA components account for not more than 3.77 each of the variance. The first PCA component being the G + C content, we had to find the biochemical interpretation of the second component. First, we found that this component exhibits a strong correlation with the previously defined (CvP-bias) (Fig. 3b,r2 = 0.93). Second, once projected on the first two dimensions of PCA space, the (20-dimensional) vector representing the difference between the frequencies of charged and polar residues (CHA-POL) appears almost parallel to the second PCA dimension (Fig. 2, black vector). As shown in Fig. 3d, the CvP-bias also correlates with the OGT almost as well as the second PCA component (r2 = 0.68 and 0.72, respectively). Finally, this parameter also successfully discriminates all hyperthermophilic microorganisms from all mesothermophilic ones. In conclusion, this analysis indicates that, among all possible combinations of G + C content and amino acid frequencies, the CvP-bias is a near optimal discriminating quantity to characterize the hyperthermophilic proteins from evolutionarily diverse microorganisms. In contrast to the CvP-bias, other previously proposed quantities thought to characterize the hyperthermophilic life style do not fare well when confronted with this expanded proteome data set. Fig. 3, e and f, shows that theJ2 index, as well as the average pI, now fail to correctly discriminate between hyperthermophiles and mesophiles. In fact, both parameters correlate only weakly, if at all, with OGT (r2 = 0.27 for J2 andr2 = 0.01 for average pI). However, all hyperthermophiles have a J2 index greater than 0.06, so that a high J2 index can be considered a necessary, but not a sufficient, criterion for the identification of a hyperthermophilic genome. Because only a single moderate thermophilic organism had been sequenced (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum) at the time of the work of Cambillau and Claverie (2Cambillau C. Claverie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32383-32386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), little could be said about the properties of moderately thermophile organisms. Proteome data is now available for nine of them. Two (Thermotoga maritimaand Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis) have OGTs close to the threshold of 80 °C we somewhat arbitrarily used to define hyperthermophile organisms. It turns out that they both exhibit PCA2,CvP-bias, and J2 values that could all allow their classification in continuity with previously defined hyperthermophiles. This clear discrimination breaks down if we use an OGT of 75 °C as the hyperthermophilicity threshold. Down to this temperature, the value along the PCA2 coordinate remains a valid criterion, allowing twoSulfolobus species (OGT of 80 and 78 °C) to be classified in continuity with the other hyperthermophiles (PCA2 < −1.6 for OGT higher than 75 °C, and PCA2 > −1.3 OGT lower than 75 °C; see Fig. 3c). However, the straightforward, more biochemically meaningful CvP-bias criteria become invalidated by three mesophiles with OGT of 37 °C,Fusobacterium nucleatum (CvP = 9.06),Halobacterium sp (CvP = 9.17),Clostridium perfingens (CvP = 9.39), exhibiting larger values than Sulfolobus(CvP = 8.90 and 8.80). Using a much larger data set including many new thermophile and mesophile whole genome sequences, this follow-up study confirms the previous suggestion that the global replacement of polar residues (Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr) by charged residues (Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg) is the dominant proteome characteristic of microorganisms adapted to hyperthermophilic growth condition (OGT >80 °C). This effect is observed for both bacteria and archaebacteria and thus is not a simple consequence of phylogenetic relationship. Even though the strict correspondence between the highestCvP-bias and the highest OGT breaks down below 80 °C, this property globally remains a characteristic of all thermophilic (OGT >55 °C) microorganisms, as shown in Fig. 1c where the CvP-bias averaged over all mesothermophiles remains markedly higher than for mesophile organisms. The influence of other adaptive strategies (e.g. to high salinity or extreme pH environments), together with the phylogenetic affinities of certain mesophiles to thermophile organisms (7Brochier C. Philippe H. Nature. 2002; 417: 244Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), probably contributes to weakenCvP-bias signal, allowing a few false positives to sneak in (such as Clostridium perfringens or Streptomyces coelicolor) (Table I.). This study confirms that a strong CvP-bias is specifically associated with hyperthermophilic proteomes. This observation is consistent with the thermodynamic advantage resulting from the increased significance of coulomb interaction with the increasing temperature (as the dielectric constant of water decreases). The simultaneous increase of oppositely charged residues (mostly Arg, Lys, and Glu) further allows for more ion pairs to be formed at the surface of hyperthermostable proteins (2Cambillau C. Claverie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32383-32386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This rationale involving the stability of proteins in a high temperature aqueous environment is also supported by our observation that the proteins predicted to be associated to the membrane (and thus designed for hydrophobic environments) exhibit a much less significant CvP-bias (data not shown). Finally, the fact that a large number of diverse genomes confirms a statistical trend previously inferred from a much smaller data set argues that increased ion-pair formation is both a significant physico-chemical factor and the preferred evolutionary pathway toward thermostable soluble proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2046643029,"We studied the role of the adenylyl cyclase ACA in Dictyostelium discoideum chemotaxis and streaming. In this process, cells orient themselves in a head to tail fashion as they are migrating to form aggregates. We show that cells lacking ACA are capable of moving up a chemoattractant gradient, but are unable to stream. Imaging of ACA-YFP reveals plasma membrane labeling highly enriched at the uropod of polarized cells. This localization requires the actin cytoskeleton but is independent of the regulator CRAC and the effector PKA. A constitutively active mutant of ACA shows dramatically reduced uropod enrichment and has severe streaming defects. We propose that the asymmetric distribution of ACA provides a compartment from which cAMP is secreted to locally act as a chemoattractant, thereby providing a unique mechanism to amplify chemical gradients. This could represent a general mechanism that cells use to amplify chemotactic responses."

We have shown previously that IRF-5, like IRF-3 and IRF-7, is a direct transducer of virus-mediated signaling and plays a role in the expression of multiple cytokines/chemokines. The present study is focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and function of IRF-5/IRF-7 heterodimers in infected cells. The interaction between IRF-5 and IRF-7 is not cooperative and results in a repression rather than enhancement of IFNA gene transcription. The formation of the IRF-5/IRF-7 heterodimer is dependent on IRF-7 phosphorylation, as shown by the glutathione S-transferase pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays. Mapping of the interaction domain revealed that formation of IRF-5/IRF-7 heterodimers occurs through the amino terminus resulting in a masking of the DNA binding domain, the consequent alteration of the composition of the enhanceosome complex binding to IFNA promoters in vivo, and modulation of the expression profile ofIFNA subtypes. Thus, these results indicate thatIRF-5 can act as both an activator and a repressor ofIFN gene induction dependent on the IRF-interacting partner, and IRF-5 may be a part of the regulatory network that ensures timely expression of the immediate early inflammatory genes.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), constitutive expression of IRF-7 was observed only in lymphoid cells but could be induced by type IIFN in other cell types (20Au W.C.

Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 9Barnes B.J. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J.

In the murine system, induction of type I IFN genes in virus-infected primary embryonic fibroblasts was proposed to proceed by two sequential phases. During the initial phase, which does not require protein synthesis, transcription of IFNB andIFNA4 genes was activated. The second phase, during which the rest of the IFNA subtypes were induced, depended on the IFN-mediated induction of IRF-7 expression (23Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, in recently generated mice with a homozygous deletion of theIRF-7 gene, production of IFNα in the isolated mouse embryo fibroblasts was completely abolished, whereas the expression of IFNऔ was significantly reduced (30Taniguchi T. Takaoka H. Takayanagi H. Kenya H. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22 (Abstr. PL-1-4): 37Crossref Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the observations in human cells, where expression ofIRF-3 conferred only virus-mediated induction of theIFNB gene (31Juang Y. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W.C. Lin R. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9837-9842Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and IRF-7 was required for expression of IFNA genes. In both the infected mouse and human cells, expression of IFNA could be rescued upon reconstitution of IRF-7 expression (25Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Surprising, however, was the observation that in the absence of IRF-7, induction of IFNA genes could be rescued by overexpression of IRF-5 (5Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to IRF-7, activation of IRF-5 was virus-specific and resulted in the expression of different IFNA subtypes than were identified in infected cells expressing IRF-7 (21Barnes B.J.

In uninfected cells, these three IRF proteins are generally present in the cytoplasm. Viral infection induces phosphorylation of IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7 by yet unidentified kinase(s), and these IRF are then retained in the nucleus where they interact with the histone transacetylases p300/CBP or PCAF (32Lin R.

Of note, IRF-5 contains two nuclear localization signals and translocates to the nucleus in uninfected cells, although less efficiently than in virus-infected cells (5Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although a large number of RNA and DNA viruses, as well as double-stranded RNA, induce phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IRF-7, phosphorylation of IRF-5 seems to be virus-specific, and this factor is not induced or phosphorylated by double-stranded RNA (5Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Structure-function analysis of IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7 proteins revealed that all of these IRF contain an auto-inhibitory domain, which in transient transfection assays suppresses the transcriptional activity of these factors (5Barnes B.J.

Furthermore, results from a study with the IRF-7dominant-negative mutant suggested that IRF-3 and IRF-7 form homo- and heterodimers and that these interactions are critical for the stimulation of the transcriptional activity of endogenousIFNA genes (22Lin R.

Virology. 2001; 280: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although the promoters of all IFNA genes are highly homologous, differential expression of these genes, as a function of cell type and inducing agent, has been observed (39Hiscott J. Cantell K.

Analysis of the transcriptional complex/enhanceosome assembled on the promoter of the IFNA1 and IFNB genes revealed that both theIFNA and IFNB enhanceosomes contain IRF-3 and IRF-7, as well as IRF-1 (19Au W.C.

In cells that express IRF-5, but not IRF-7, both IRF-3 and IRF-5 were found to be bound to IFNAVRE and the endogenous IFNA promoters (5Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell.

Barnes and P. F. Bocarsly, unpublished data. that in monocytes, and particularly in precursor dendritic cells (pDC2) that are high producers of IFNα, both IRF-7 and IRF-5are expressed. The goal of this study was therefore to gain more insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of human IFNAgenes in cells expressing both IRF-7 and IRF-5, and to determine whether the expression of these two IRF in the cell is associated with high levels of IFNA production, as seen in pDC2 cells (42Siegal F.P.

To this effect, we have generated 2fTGH cell lines expressing ectopic IRF-7 or IRF-5, or both of these proteins. Surprisingly, the simultaneous expression of both IRF-5 and IRF-7 did not result in an enhanced synthesis of biologically active IFN in infected cells; to the contrary, expression of both factors resulted in a distinct repression of IFN. We also reveal that whereas IRF-5 can interact with IRF-7, there is a mutual binding exclusion between these two family members to IFNA promoters from the lysates of infected cells. These results indicate the lack of cooperative interaction between IRF-5 and IRF-7 and enhancement of IFNAproduction but show that the relative levels of IRF-5 andIRF-7 expressed in infected cells determine the distinct profile of IFNA genes induced. 2fTGH/IRF-5 and 2fTGH/IRF-7 overexpressing cells were generated as described previously (21Barnes B.J.

M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma. GST fusion constructs were transformed into BL21 bacteria and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-औ-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The GST fusion proteins were purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-agarose column (Sigma). Coomassie Blue staining of the GST fusion proteins was used to quantify the amount of protein bound to beads. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins and beads were then applied in each pull-down assay. The 35S-labeled proteins were synthesized in vitro using the coupled TnT T7 transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each reaction mixture contained 1 ॖg of nonlinearized expression plasmid and was incubated (90 min, 30 °C) in the presence of 4 ॖl of Translabel (DuPont) amino acid mixture. GST fusion proteins (0.5 ॖg) bound to glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 10-ॖl reaction mixture aliquots of35S-labeled proteins in 250 ॖl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.17 Nonidet P-40, 500 ॖg of bovine serum albumin, and 87 glycerol) at 4 °C for 2 h. After three washes (10 min at room temperature) with binding buffer, the proteins bound to the beads were solubilized in sample buffer and resolved by 87 SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to film. In addition, binding of IRF from whole cell lysates of uninfected or virus-infected 2fTGH/IRF-5 cells was performed using lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mm protease inhibitor mixture). GST fusion protein immobilized on beads and whole cell extract were incubated in 300 ॖl of binding buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed 3 times with binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted and resolved by 107 SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond transfer membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated with anti-IRF-1 antibodies or anti-IRF-7 antibodies. Immunocomplexes were detected by using the ECL system. 2fTGH/IRF-5 cells were co-transfected with the IRF-7 expression plasmid to examine interactions between IRF-5/IRF-7. Cells were uninfected or infected with Sendai virus or NDV for 6 h and then lysed in IP lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.17 Nonidet P-40, 107 glycerol, and 0.2 mm protease inhibitor mixture). Extracts (250 ॖg) were incubated with 1 ॖg of anti-IRF-1 antibodies or 1 ॖg of anti-IRF-7 antibodies cross-linked to 30 ॖl of protein A-Sepharose beads, respectively, for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed 4 times with IP lysis buffer and eluted by boiling the beads for 3 min in 1× SDS loading buffer. Eluted proteins were separated by 107 SDS-PAGE and transferred, and IRF-5 was detected by anti-FLAG antibodies. In the transient transfection assay, 2 × 106 2fTGH or HeLa cells were transfected with a constant amount of DNA (5 ॖg/60-mm plate) by using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). For the SAP assays, equal amounts (2.5 ॖg) of reporter plasmid and IRF-expressing plasmid were co-transfected with the औ-galactosidase expression plasmid (50–100 ng). The transfected cells were divided 14 h later and infected with NDV for 16 h. The alkaline phosphatase (SAP) assays were performed as described previously (44Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 46Au W.C. Raj N.B. Pine R. Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated 3 times. The औ-galactosidase expression levels were used to normalize the difference in transfection efficiency. Double-stranded oligomers corresponding to theIFNA1 and IFNA14 VRE region (−110 to −53 bp) were synthesized and biotin-labeled at the 5′ end of the antisense strand. Two micrograms of the double-stranded oligomers were incubated with streptavidin magnetic beads (200 ॖl) (Dynal Inc.) for 1 h in TEN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl), and the unbound DNA was removed by extensive washing with same buffer. IRF from whole cell extracts were bound to DNA on magnetic beads as described previously (21Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Beads were then washed, and the bound proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. IRF were identified by immunoblot with the respective antibodies as described (5Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Blots were stripped (200 ml of 107 SDS in 1000 ml, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 0.77 2-mercaptoethanol) by incubating for 10 min at 65 °C and then rotating for 10 min at room temperature. Blots were then washed 3–5 times with TBST and re-probed with the respective antibodies. One microgram of total RNA isolated by the cesium chloride method was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with oligo(dT) primers in a 30-ॖl reaction. From this mixture of cDNAs, IFNA was amplified by PCR using primers that detect all IFNA genes, and औ-actin was amplified as an internal control (25Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L.

A one-way analysis of variance (faculty.vassar.edu/∼lowry/VassarStats.html) was used to analyze the significance of observed differences in IFNA subtype expression. Levels of biologically active IFNα in the medium were determined by the antiviral assay (47Cheung S.C. Chattopadhyay S.K. Hartley J.W. Morse H.C.I. Pitha P.M. J.

Briefly, 2fTGH/IRF-5 or 2fTGH/IRF-7 cells (6 × 107) were infected with Sendai virus or NDV for 6 h or left uninfected. The proteins bound to DNA were cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde in aqueous buffer (0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 17 for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.125 m glycine. The cell pellets were washed with 5 ml of wash buffer (5 mmPIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm PMSF), resuspended in sonication buffer (17 SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) on ice, and lysed by sonication for 10 s. Samples were diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (0.017 SDS, 1.17 Triton X-100, 1.2 mmEDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl) and pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose. Following the pre-clearing, equal amounts of proteins (as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent) were immunoprecipitated with 1 ॖg of anti-IRF-1, anti-IRF-3, anti-IRF-7, or anti-FLAG antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were extensively washed and treated with RNase A (50 ॖg/ml), 0.57 SDS, and proteinase K (500 ॖg/ml). The cross-linked DNA-protein complexes were reverted by heating at 65 °C for 6 h, and the DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA purified by precipitation with 2 m ammonium acetate/ethanol was used as a template for PCR amplification with universal primers corresponding to the regions of human endogenous IFNA genes that are conserved in all subtypes (5Barnes B.J.

Molecular genetic and biochemical studies were used to define further the functional and physical interactions between these proteins. Multicopy extragenic suppressors were selected in strains carrying deletions inFAA1 and FAA4 or FAA1 andFAT1. Each strain is unable to grow under synthetic lethal conditions when exogenous long-chain fatty acids are required, and neither strain accumulates the fluorescent long-chain fatty acid C1-BODIPY-C12 indicating a fatty acid transport defect. By using these phenotypes as selective screens, plasmids were identified encoding FAA1, FAT1, andFAA4 in the faa1Δ faa4Δ strain and encoding FAA1 and FAT1 in thefaa1Δ fat1Δ strain. MulticopyFAA4 could not suppress the growth defect in thefaa1Δ fat1Δ strain indicating some essential functions of Fat1p cannot be performed by Faa4p. Chromosomally encoded FAA1 and FAT1 are not able to suppress the growth deficiencies of the fat1Δfaa1Δ and faa1Δ faa4Δstrains, respectively, indicating Faa1p and Fat1p play distinct roles in the fatty acid import process. When expressed from a 2μ plasmid, Fat1p contributes significant oleoyl-CoA synthetase activity, which indicates vectorial esterification and metabolic trapping are the driving forces behind import. Evidence of a physical interaction between Fat1p and FACS was provided using three independent biochemical approaches. First, a C-terminal peptide of Fat1p deficient in fatty acid transport exerted a dominant negative effect against long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity. Second, protein fusions employing Faa1p as bait and portions of Fat1p as trap were active when tested using the yeast two-hybrid system. Third, co-expressed, differentially tagged Fat1p and Faa1p or Faa4p were co-immunoprecipitated.

This complexity is essential and contributes to the barrier function of the membrane and to selectively regulated transport of molecules into and out of the cell. Unlike hydrophilic molecules such as sugars and amino acids, hydrophobic fatty acids are able to dissolve in the membrane, and as a consequence, the processes governing their regulated movement across membranes are likely to be quite distinct. Recent investigations into the problem of fatty acid transport have intensified due to findings that exogenous fatty acids influence a number of important cellular functions, including signal transduction and transcriptional control. To date, several distinct membrane-bound and membrane-associated proteins have been identified as components of fatty acid import systems in eukaryotic cells. Most notable among these are fatty acid translocase (FAT,1 the murine homologue to CD36) (1Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol.

Abumrad N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whereas FATP and fatty acyl-CoA synthetase were both identified using expression cloning (3Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Both FAT and FATP have been claimed to be fatty acid transport proteins (1Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R.

Despite these claims, there is controversy surrounding the classification of FAT/CD36 and FATP asbona fide integral membrane-bound fatty acid transporters (10Hamilton J.A. Johnson R.A. Corkey B. Kamp F. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 16: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Indeed, there are gnawing questions as to whether these proteins actually function as components of a fatty acid delivery system (i.e. FAT/DC36) or as components of a utilization driven fatty acid import system (i.e. FATP), which also includes fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (2Abumrad N.A. Coburn C. Ibrahimi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37051-37059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this regard, proteins identified as required for fatty acid transport may function not as transport proteins per se but in an alternative manner, perhaps by promoting selectivity and specificity of fatty acid delivery to downstream metabolic events. The best characterized fatty acid transport system is that found inEscherichia coli (4DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 41-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the specific integral outer membrane protein, FadL, is required for long-chain fatty acid binding and transport across that membrane. The fatty acid ligands must then traverse the bacterial periplasmic space and the inner membrane. No inner membrane proteins have been identified that are required for this process. On the basis of studies defining the energetics of fatty acid transport, we suggested protonated fatty acids flip across the inner membrane and are subsequently abstracted from the inner membrane concomitant with activation by fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (12Azizan A. Sherin D. DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this manner, exogenous fatty acids are metabolically trapped as CoA thioesters upon transport, which in turn generates a concentration gradient further driving the system. Overath and colleagues (5Klein K. Steinberg R. Fiethen B. Overath P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) coined the term “vectorial acylation” to describe this process at the time they identified the structural gene for the E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (fadD). This postulate was initially expanded by Frerman and Bennett (6Frerman F.E. Bennett W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 159: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and subsequently by our laboratory (4DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 41-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Azizan A. Sherin D. DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as the underlying mechanism driving long-chain fatty acid transport in bacteria. Although at the time the model of vectorial acylation was proposed the bacterial fatty acid transporter FadL had not been identified, our subsequent studies have clearly shown that both FadL and fatty acyl-CoA synthetase are required for fatty acid transport in E. coli. By using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model eukaryotic system, we have recently shown the fatty acyl-CoA synthetases Faa1p or Faa4p function in the fatty acid transport system presumably by activating exogenous fatty acids concomitant with transport (11Færgeman N.J. Black P.N. Zhao X.D. Knudsen J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37051-37059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This finding presents somewhat of a conundrum as we have also shown that long-chain fatty acid import in yeast requires Fat1p, the yeast orthologue of the murine FATP1 (13Færgeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). One of the central questions we are now faced with is to determine the mechanisms by which Fat1p and fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (Faa1p and/or Faa4p) work in concert to promote fatty acid import. A similar situation appears to be operational in murine adipocytes, where there are data supporting a functional association of mmFATP1 with fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (3Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar,15Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest vectorial acylation is one general mechanism of fatty acid import, which functions to promote the regulated import and metabolic trapping of exogenous long-chain fatty acids. In our prior investigations into fatty acid import in yeast, we used reverse genetic approaches to demonstrate this process requires the yeast orthologue of mmFATP (Fat1p) and fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (Faa1p or Faa4p) (11Færgeman N.J.

Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Despite the information gleaned from these studies, there are no data demonstrating these proteins function cooperatively in a physical complex, and there is no information as to whether there are additional proteins involved in mediating the regulated import of exogenous long-chain fatty acids. In the present work, we sought to identify additional components required for fatty acid transport and to confirm the importance of Fat1p and fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (Faa1p and Faa4p) by using a genetic approach. A valuable molecular-genetic method for the identification of participants in multicomponent cellular processes is the selection of plasmid-encoded multicopy extragenic suppressors (16Rhine J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The rationale behind this approach is that the altered phenotype resulting from a deficiency in one participant can be suppressed by overexpression of another participant required for the same process (16Rhine J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this manner, we sought to identify plasmid-encoded multicopy extragenic suppressors of the deficiency in fatty acid import caused by deletion ofFAT1 and/or FAA1 and FAA4. We report that plasmids encoding Fat1p, Faa1p, and Faa4p were identified in a screen for multicopy extragenic suppressors of the transport and activation deficiency of a faa1Δ faa4Δ strain, and plasmids encoding only Fat1p and Faa1p were identified as multicopy extragenic suppressors of the transport deficiency of afaa1Δ fat1Δ strain. Additional biochemical evidence is provided demonstrating Fat1p and acyl-CoA synthetase interact in a physical complex. This work establishes for the first time a genetic, physical, and functional linkage between Fat1p and fatty acyl-CoA synthetase and substantiates the hypothesis that these proteins, perhaps exclusively, are required for long-chain fatty acid transport in yeast. The S. cerevisiaestrains used in this study are listed in TableI. The fat1Δ::G418 mutation was introduced by transformation of the strain of interest with linear DNA generated by amplification of the kanamycin resistance cassette (resulting in G418 resistance) using oligonucleotides complementary to both FAT1 and the cassette as described (17Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar).

Chromosomal replacement of the native gene was confirmed by Southern analysis of chromosomal DNA from the transformants by comparison to DNA obtained from the parental strain.

Yeast-supplemented minimal media contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (YNB), 2% dextrose, adenine (20 mg/liter), uracil (20 mg/liter), and amino acids as required (arginine, tryptophan, methionine, histidine, and tyrosine (20 mg/liter); lysine (30 mg/liter); and leucine (100 mg/liter)). To assess growth when fatty-acid synthase was inhibited, cells were grown on YNBD or YPDA plates supplemented with 45 μm cerulenin and 100 μm oleic acid unless otherwise indicated. Growth in liquid culture and on plates was at 30 °C. Yeast extract, yeast peptone, and yeast nitrogen base were obtained from Difco. Oleic acid was obtained from Sigma. 3H- or14C-labeled fatty acids were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and American Radiochemicals. C1-BODIPY-C12 was purchased from Molecular Probes. Enzymes required for all DNA manipulations were from Promega, Invitrogen, New England Biolabs, U. S. Biochemical Corp., or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-V5 antibody and anti-T7 antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen and Novagen, respectively. Anti-Pma1p was the gift of Dr. Günther Daum (Technische Universität Graz, Graz, Austria). Cells of the faa1Δfaa4Δ strain or faa1Δ fat1Δ strain were rendered competent using lithium acetate as noted above, transformed with a yeast multicopy library in YEp24, and transformants selected on YNBD containing the appropriate supplements but lacking uracil (19Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Thirty thousand individual Ura+ transformants were selected from the library and were screened for growth following replica plating on YPD plates containing 45 μm cerulenin and 100 μm oleic acid (YPD-CER-OLE). Transformants that were able to grow on YPD-CER-OLE were colony-purified on the same media and phenotypes validated on YPD-CER-OLE. Plasmids were isolated from those that retained positive growth on all three media and retransformed into the faa1Δ faa4Δ andfaa1Δ fat1Δ strains. Additionally, the same plasmids were propagated in the E. coli strain DH5α, purified using QiaPrep columns (Qiagen), and sequenced using two plasmid-specific primers flanking the insert (upstream, 5′-GGAGCCACTATCGACTACGC-3′; downstream, 5′-CCTGTGGCGCCGGTGATG-3′) using an Applied Biosystems automated fluorescence DNA sequencer. The sequences obtained were compared with the Saccharomycesgenome data base for identification. Fatty acid import was assessed using confocal laser scanning microscopy to detect accumulation of the fluorescent long-chain fatty acid analogue 4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid (C1-BODIPY-C12) as described previously (13Færgeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Following growth under selective conditions, cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 0.1 volume of PBS. All steps were performed at room temperature. Washed cells were incubated with 10 μmC1-BODIPY-C12 for 60 s, washed with PBS containing 50 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (two times), PBS, resuspended in PBS, and visualized on an NORAN-OZ confocal laser scanning microscopy, interfaced with a Nikon Diaphot 200 inverted microscope equipped with a PlanApo ×60, 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective lens. The instrument settings for brightness, contrast, laser power, and slit size were optimized for the brightest sample to ensure that the confocal laser scanning microscopy was set for its full dynamic range. The same settings were used for all subsequent image collections. Cells were grown from overnight cultures in YNBD (with appropriate supplements) and grown toA 600 of 1.0. Following growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended to a density of 1.2 × 109 cells/ml in 200 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm EDTA, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μmpepstatin A, and 8 μm leupeptin. The cells were lysed by vigorously vortexing the cell suspension containing glass beads for 1 min, 5 times at 0 °C. Samples were clarified by centrifugation (1,500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and supernatants were used to assess fatty acyl-CoA synthetase activities as described (20Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 0.01% Triton X-100, fatty acid dissolved in 10 mg/ml α-cyclodextrin (final concentrations of fatty acids were 50 μm), 0.5 mm coenzyme A, and cell extract in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The reactions were initiated by the addition of coenzyme A, incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and terminated by the addition of 2.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol, n-heptane, 1 mH2SO4 (40:10:1). The radioactive fatty acid was removed by organic extraction using n-heptane. Acyl-CoA formed during the reaction remained in the aqueous fraction and was quantified by scintillation counting. Protein concentrations in the cell extracts were determined using the Bradford assay and bovine serum albumin as a standard (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216204) Google Scholar). The values presented represent the average from at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. All experiments were subjected to analysis of variance (StatView, SAS Institute, Inc.). The sequence encoding the C-terminal 125 amino acids (residues 545–669) of Fat1p was cloned in-frame to the T7 epitope tag of the yeast expression vector YEpGALSET983 to generate YEpDB213. The resulting T7Fat1p125C fusion was expressed under the control of the GAL10 promoter. To test for negative dominance, YEpDB213 was transformed into YB332. Cells transformed with the vector (YEpGALSET983) served as a control. The cells were pre-grown in YNBD (without leucine) overnight. The culture was harvested by centrifugation and resuspended to a cell density of 0.1 A 600 in 50 ml of YNB containing 2% galactose and 2% raffinose to induce expression ofT7Fat1p125C. When the density reached 1.0A 600, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of breaking buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μmpepstatin A, and 8 μm leupeptin). The cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads and assayed for long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity as detailed above. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to test Faa1p-Fat1p interaction (22Bartel P.L. Fields S. Bartel F. The Yeast Two Hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997Google Scholar). The bait plasmid vector used was pEG202; the trap plasmid vector was pJG4-5, and the reporter plasmid was pSH18-34T. To generate the full-length Faa1p-bait fusion protein, the coding sequence of FAA1 was amplified using the upstream primer 5′-AGACCCATGGATGGTTGCTCAATATACCG-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-AAATGTTGGCGGCCGCAGACGAACTATAAACGGC-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was cleaved with NcoI and NotI and ligated into pEG202 cleaved with the same enzymes. For the trap plasmids, a single primer was used to amplify DNA at the 3′ end of the gene including the termination codon encoding amino acid 669, 5′-GAACATCCTCGAGTAATTTAATTGTTTGTGC-3′, whereas unique primers were used to amplify DNA at the 5′ ends. These included 5′-TTTTTAGCGCGCAATACTAAAGGCACTCCG-3′ to generate a peptide from amino acids 169 to 669 of Fat1p (Fat1p500C) and 5′-GAAGATGAATTCACGGCCAGTAACAAAGAAC-3′ to generate a peptide from amino acids 544 to 669 of Fat1p (Fat1p125C). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into pJG4-5. To test interaction, the Faa1p bait plasmid and the target trap plasmid of interest were transformed into yeast strain W303B carrying the reporter plasmid pSH18-34T. The reporter plasmid pSH18-34T contains thelacZ gene encoding β–galactosidase driven by a promoter controlled by eight LexA operators. To maintain each plasmid, transformants were selected and maintained on YNBD media lacking uracil (for pSH18-34T), histidine (for the pEG202-derived bait), and tryptophan (for the pJG4-5-derived traps). Expression of β-galactosidase activity was measured using the liquid assay employing o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate as described previously (23Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). For these experiments, cells were grown overnight in YNBD (without uracil, histidine, or tryptophan) and subcultured to A 600 0.02–0.1 in 10 ml of YNB containing 2% galactose and 2% raffinose. Growth was continued until the A 600 reached 0.5–1.0, at which time was stopped by placing the cultures on ice. Aliquots of cells (1 ml) were harvested by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 3 min). The cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.05% Triton X-100. The sample was frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C prior to assay. All experiments defining β-galactosidase activities were performed in duplicate at least five times as described previously (23Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar); the data were analyzed using pairedt-tests against cells containing the bait (Faa1p), the trap vector (pJG4-5), and the reporter (StatView, SAS Institute, Inc.). To identify a protein complex containing Fat1p and Faa1p or Faa4p, plasmids were constructed expressing each protein fused to a peptide tag, which is recognized by a commercially available antibody. Full-length Fat1p tagged with a T7 epitope was constructed in the vector YEpGALSET983 to generate plasmid YEpDB204. The coding sequence of FAT1 was amplified using the upstream primer 5′-GCGGAGCTCATGTCTCCCATACAGGTTGTTG-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-CGCGGTACCATGCTCTAATGGAAAGGTAC-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was cleaved with SacI and KpnI and ligated into YEpGALSET983 cleaved with the same restriction enzymes. Expression clones encoding full-length Faa1p or Faa4p tagged at the C terminus with a V5 epitope were obtained from Invitrogen (GeneStormTM clones pYES2/YOR317w and pYES2/YMR246w, respectively). The plasmid pair encoding the proteins of interest (e.g. T7Fat1p and V5Faa1p or V5Faa4p) was transformed into the fat1Δ faa1Δ strain to test Fat1p-Faa1p interaction or the fat1Δfaa4Δ strain to test Fat1p-Faa4p interaction. The cells were pre-grown in YNBD without leucine and uracil to maintain both plasmids; cells were subsequently subcultured to 0.1A 600 in 75 ml of YNB containing 2% galactose and 2% raffinose (without leucine and uracil) to induce expression of the epitope-tagged target proteins. When the cell density reached 1.0A 600, the cells were harvested, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. The cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads on ice as detailed above. The glass beads were pelleted by centrifugation (2,000 rpm, 2 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was removed to a new tube, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 45 min. The sample was clarified by centrifugation (4,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). The resultant supernatant was split into three 0.5-ml aliquots (∼0.7 mg/ml); 2 μg of anti-T7 or 2 μg of anti-V5 antibodies was added to the first two, and an equal volume of lysis buffer was added to the third as a control (protein A-Sepharose bead control). The samples were incubated with gentle rotation overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (50 μl of 50% slurry) were added to each sample, which were then incubated for 2 h with gentle rotation at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose beads (containing the antigen-antibody complex) were pelleted by centrifugation (1,000 rpm, 1 min, 4 °C) and subsequently washed 5 times in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. The final pellets containing the protein A-Sepharose beads/antigen-antibody complex were resuspended in 70 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled 5 min, and the proteins from"
https://openalex.org/W2104155937,"The mechanism of RNA degradation in Escherichia coli involves endonucleolytic cleavage, polyadenylation of the cleavage product by poly(A) polymerase, and exonucleolytic degradation by the exoribonucleases, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) and RNase II. The poly(A) tails are homogenous, containing only adenosines in most of the growth conditions. In the chloroplast, however, the same enzyme, PNPase, polyadenylates and degrades the RNA molecule; there is no equivalent for the E. coli poly(A) polymerase enzyme. Because cyanobacteria is a prokaryote believed to be related to the evolutionary ancestor of the chloroplast, we asked whether the molecular mechanism of RNA polyadenylation in the Synechocystis PCC6803 cyanobacteria is similar to that in E. coli or the chloroplast. We found that RNA polyadenylation in Synechocystis is similar to that in the chloroplast but different from E. coli. No poly(A) polymerase enzyme exists, and polyadenylation is performed by PNPase, resulting in heterogeneous poly(A)-rich tails. These heterogeneous tails were found in the amino acid coding region, the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of mRNAs, as well as in rRNA and the single intron located at the tRNAfmet. Furthermore, unlikeE. coli, the inactivation of PNPase or RNase II genes caused lethality. Together, our results show that the RNA polyadenylation and degradation mechanisms in cyanobacteria and chloroplast are very similar to each other but different from E. coli.

The degradation starts with the initial endonucleolytic cleavage carried out primarily by the endoribonuclease E (RNase E). The cleavage products are then polyadenylated at their 3′ ends by the poly(A) polymerase (PAP)1 enzyme inEscherichia coli and the polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) in the chloroplast. The polyadenylated molecules are then rapidly degraded exonucleolytically by PNPase and ribonuclease II (RNase II) (1Schuster G. Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Hayes R. Kudla J. Gruissem W. Tren. Biochem.

Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Finally, the remaining short oligoribonucleotides are degraded by the oligoribonuclease enzyme (4Deutscher M.P. Li Z. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 67-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although the inhibition of polyadenylation in the chloroplast inhibited exonucleolytic degradation, implying that this is the only mechanism in the RNA degradation process, two RNA degradation mechanisms, a polyadenylation-dependent and a polyadenylation-independent one, were suggested to take place in E. coli (5Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1173-1178Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4658-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Polyadenylation in E. coli is carried out primarily by PAP (7Mohanty B.K. Kushner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11966-11971Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Also in this bacterium, the RNase E enzyme, part of the PNPase population, an RNA helicase, some RNA molecules, and the glycolytic enzyme enolase are associated in a high molecular weight complex called a degradosome (8Carpousis A.J. Vanzo N.F. Raynal L.C. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the chloroplast, the photosynthetic organelle of the plant cell is believed to have an evolutionary prokaryotic origin; many characteristics of the gene expression system resemble those of bacteria. When the RNA degradation mechanism was analyzed in the chloroplast, it was found to be very similar to that of E. coli (1Schuster G. Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Hayes R. Kudla J. Gruissem W. Tren. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 199-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Monde R.A. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, significant differences were observed in the two systems. The first is the lack of the degradosome, the high molecular weight complex described above (9Baginsky S. Shteiman-Kotler A. Liveanu V. Yehudai-Resheff S. Bellaoui M. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Schuster G. Gruissem W. RNA. 2001; 7: 1464-1475PubMed Google Scholar). Second, whereas PAP is responsible for most of the polyadenylation activity in E. coli, PNPase performs both the polymerization and the degradation of the endonucleolytic cleavage products during the RNA degradation process in the chloroplast of higher plants. This is the reason why, unlike the situation in E. coli where the sequences of the poly(A) tails are mostly homogenous adenosines, these sequences in the chloroplast are heterogeneous and also include the three other nucleotides (10Yehudai-Resheff S. Hirsh M. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These observations raised the question as to why RNA polyadenylation is performed by PAP in E. coli whereas the same function is performed by PNPase in the chloroplast. Assuming a common, unique evolutionary ancestor for prokaryotes and the chloroplast organelle, one possibility is that the PAP and degradosome functions were acquired by E. coli late in its evolution. Another possibility is that they might have been lost in the chloroplast. Cyanobacteria is a prokaryote believed to be evolutionarily closely related to the chloroplast ancestor. However, unlike the chloroplast of higher plants in which the mRNA half-life is in the order of hours, it is in the range of several minutes or less in cyanobacteria, similar to E. coli (11Suzuki I. Los D.A. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Murata N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12Garcia-Dominguez M. Muro-Pastor M.I. Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Kujat S.L. Owttrim G.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Synechocystis genome contains genes that are highly homologous to RNase E, PNPase, RNase II/R, and PAP, the major players in the RNA polyadenylation and degradation pathway. Here, we analyzed whether the polyadenylation of RNA molecules is performed in the Synechocystiscyanobacteria by the PAP enzyme, as in E. coli, or by the PNPase enzyme, as in the chloroplast of higher plants. Our results suggest that PNPase carries out this function inSynechocystis. We also confirmed a previous observation that RNase E in Synechocystis is not engaged in an E. coli-type degradosome multicomponent complex (14Kaberdin V.R. Miczak A. Jakobsen J.S. Lin-Chao S. McDowall K.J. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11637-11642Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is most likely that E. coli and some other related bacteria have acquired the PAP and degradosome complex functions late in evolution, possibly to enable rapid RNA turnover in these bacteria strains. We also analyzed the single intron located at the tRNAfmet gene and found it to be heavily polyadenylated at internal sites, suggesting that introns are degraded by the same mechanism following splicing. Synechocystis PCC6803 was grown in a BG11 medium at 30 °C (15Rippka R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). A freshly grown logarithmic culture was divided into two parts; half was transferred to a medium without phosphate for 2 days, and half was maintained in a phosphate-containing medium. Total RNA was isolated using the “hot phenol” protocol (16Rott R. Levy H. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4605-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the poly(A) RNA was isolated using the Qiagen kit (Qiagen Inc.). Total spinach leaf RNA (30 μg) and the poly(A)+ RNA of Synechocystis (obtained from 200 μg of total RNA) were 3′ end-labeled with [32P]pCp and T4 RNA ligase for 24 h at 4 °C before digestion with 25 μg of RNase A and 300 units of RNase T1 for 1 h at 37 °C (17Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). poly(A) tails were resolved in 12% polyacrylamide sequencing gels containing 7 m urea. To obtain an equal signal, the equivalent of 8 and 200 μg of total RNA from spinach andSynehcocystis, respectively, were loaded on the gel. RNA was isolated from a freshly grown logarithmic culture ofSynechocystis PCC6803. The guanylation of the RNA was performed on 40 μg of RNA incubated for 60 min at 25 °C with 1 mm GTP and E. coli PNPase (Sigma). Following phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, cDNA was synthesized using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase and d(C9T6) primer at 50 °C for 2 h (18Kusov Y.Y. Shatirishvili G. Dzagurov G. Gauss-Muller V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E57Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,19Komine Y. Kwong L. Anguera M. Schuster G. Stern D.B. RNA. 2000; 6: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Following reverse transcription, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of H2O, and 0.5 μl was used for PCR amplification using d(C9T6) and gene-specific primers (see Fig. 2). The PCR products were gel-purified and either directly sequenced or cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega Inc.). In some of the clones, the oligo(dT)-adaptor oligonucleotide was used to prime the cDNA synthesis, as described previously (17Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotides used were as follows: oligonucleotide rbcLA1, starting at nucleotide 1345 of rbcL, 5′-CGGGAAGCCTGTCGTTGGTC; rbcL3, starting at nucleotide 1373 ofrbcL, 5′-AGTTGGCCGCCGCCGCCTGCGAA; rbcL6, nucleotide −130; and 5′-CGCAGATTTTTCTCGCAACC (see Fig. 3). The eight nucleotides of the 3′ end of rbcL6 were found also at location 2478 of the 23 S rRNA, and therefore this oligonucleotide was used as well in the RT-PCR of this gene (see Fig. 4), tRNAu, starting at nucleotide 342 of the tRNAfmet 5′-TGAGCTGTTTTACGTCTTCC (see Fig. 4).Figure 3poly(A)-rich addition to rbcLtranscripts in Synechocystis.

The PAP (putative), PNPase, RNase II, and RNase E genes (see TableII for the identification of the genes) were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA, isolated as described previously (20Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar), and cloned into the PUC57T plasmid (Fermentus Inc.). The nucleotide sequences of the PCR primers are available upon request. The kanamycin cassette was cloned into theAvrII sites of the putative PAP, theAcc65I sites of PNPase,NheI/StuI of RNase II, andBspMI/StyI of RNase E. Each plasmid contained about 200–500 bp of the corresponding 5′ and 3′ ends interrupted by the 1,200 bp of the kanamycin resistance expression cassette. The plasmids were transformed into Synechocystis PCC6803 cells, as described previously (22Jansson C. Salih G. Eriksson J. Wiklund R. Ghebramedhin C.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 166-181Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The transformed cells were spread on a nitrocellulose membrane, grown on increasing concentrations of kanamycin (5–500 μg/ml), and analyzed by PCR for the homoplasmic presence of the disrupted gene. No homoplasmic cells could be obtained in all of the genes disrupted in this work, even after transferring the colonies eight times on plates containing 500 μg/ml kanamycin. This indicated that the expression of these genes is required for the viability of the cells.Table IIThe Synechocystis genes that were inactivated in this workNameGeneAmino acidsViabilityPAP (putative)Sll1253942NoPNPaseSll1043718NoRNase II/RSll1290667NoRNase ESlr1129674NoThe genes indicated were interrupted with a kanamycin cassette inserted into the middle of each one.

The putative PAP ofSynechocystis was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the E. coli pQE31 expression vector (New England Biolabs, Inc.) using the SmaI and PstI restriction endonuclease sites. Expression and purification on a NTA-agarose column were performed, as described previously (9Baginsky S. Shteiman-Kotler A. Liveanu V. Yehudai-Resheff S. Bellaoui M. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Schuster G. Gruissem W. RNA. 2001; 7: 1464-1475PubMed Google Scholar). An in vitro polyadenylation assay, using either the recombinant putative PAP protein or the yeast PAP (Amersham Biosciences), was performed as described previously (10Yehudai-Resheff S. Hirsh M. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, [32P]-labeled RNA corresponding to the 3′ end of the spinach chloroplast gene petD was incubated with 1 mm ATP in Buffer E (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 70 mm KCl, 16.25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol). Following incubation, the RNA was purified and analyzed using denaturing polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography. For the nucleotidyltransferase activity assay, the recombinant protein (10 ng) was incubated with E. coli tRNA (Sigma) in a buffer containing CTP, ATP, and [32P]ATP (23Yue D. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29693-29700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Following incubation, the RNA was purified and analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed by applying Synechocystis soluble proteins to a Superdex 200 column in Buffer E at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (9Baginsky S. Shteiman-Kotler A. Liveanu V. Yehudai-Resheff S. Bellaoui M. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Schuster G. Gruissem W. RNA. 2001; 7: 1464-1475PubMed Google Scholar). Each fraction was then loaded on a heparin column. The bound proteins were eluted, precipitated by cold acetone, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using specific antibodies against the ArabidopsisRNase E. The Superdex 200 column was calibrated with the following protein standards: thyroglobolin, 669 kDa; catalase, 232 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; and casein, 30 kDa. For the production of antibodies, the Arabidopsis RNase E was expressed in E. coli, tagged with His6 using the pQE expression system, purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, and injected into a rabbit. Specific antibodies were prepared as described previously (24Lisitsky I. Kotler A. Schuster G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17648-17653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and were used to detect the protein. The protein amount was determined using the Bio-Rad assay. The addition of poly(A) and poly(A)-rich tails to the RNA of E. coli, the chloroplast, and the mitochondria of higher plants has been studied in recent years. Although the analysis of poly(A) tails in E. coli disclosed homogenous, 30–60-nt-long poly(A) tails located at the 3′ end, as well as at internal sites, poly(A) tails containing other nucleotides were described in stationary grown bacteria and when the gene of PAP was inactivated (7Mohanty B.K. Kushner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11966-11971Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This strain, containing an inactivated PAP, is viable, because PNPase polyadenylates the RNA. Most of the polyadenylating sites in chloroplasts were located internally and not at the 3′ end; they were several hundred nucleotides long and heterogeneous, consisting of about 70% adenosines, 20% guanosines, and the rest of nucleotides, uridines, and cytidines (17Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity of the polyadenylated tails was later explained by the lack of equivalent E. coli PAP enzyme. Indeed, it was found that PNPase is the only polyadenylation enzyme in the chloroplast (10Yehudai-Resheff S. Hirsh M. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, the nature of the polyadenylated tail could enlighten us regarding the polyadenylating enzyme, which is homogenous for PAP and heterogeneous for PNPase. Because cyanobacteria is believed to be closely related to the evolutionary ancestor of the chloroplast, we intended to analyze which is the major polyadenylating enzyme in this organism, PAP as in E. coli or PNPase as in the chloroplast. To detect RNA polyadenylation in Synechocystis, and because we had predicted that only a minute fraction of the RNA is polyadenylated at the steady-state level, we first enriched the polyadenylated RNA by applying the total RNA to the oligo(dT) affinity column. The oligo(dT) purification step was necessary, because several trials to carry out this experiment on total RNA had previously failed. The RNA bound to the column was radioactively labeled at the 3′ end with [32P]pCp and then digested for completion with RNase A (cutting after C and U residues) and RNase T1 (cleaving after G residues). Therefore, only poly(A) sequences present at the 3′ end of the RNA molecules remained intact and radioactively labeled. As a control, we used total RNA isolated from spinach leaves, in which we expected to get a ladder of poly(A) tails of all lengths (17Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, because phosphate starvation was reported recently (25Lilly J.W. Maul J. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2681-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to enhance RNA stability significantly in the chloroplast ofChlamydomonas reinhardtii, we performed the same experiment on culture that was starved for phosphate. An analysis of the products on polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography revealed that the total spinach leaf RNA was degraded into a ladder of A-containing homopolymers, as reported previously (17Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) for polyadenylated RNA (Fig.1). The ladder shape of these results reflected the formation of poly(A) tails of every length because of the metabolism of the polyadenylated tails (26Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 27Sachs A.B. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22955-22958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The products ofSynechocystis RNA also resulted in a ladder of shorter tails of up to about 30 nucleotides long (Fig. 1). BecauseSynechocystis-polyadenylated RNA was first isolated on an oligo(dT) column, we could not determine whether the stronger signal observed in the non-phosphate depleted cells indicated a greater amount of polyadenylated tails under these conditions. However, this difference was observed in several repetitions of this experiment. Roughly 25 times the amount of Synechocystis RNA was used as a starting material to obtain a similar signal (Fig. 1). This may indicate that the amount of polyadenylated tails inSynechocystis is about 25 times less the amount of mRNA in the plant cell. Together, these results implied thatSynechocystis RNA is polyadenylated, suggesting that this polyadenylation produces homogenous poly(A) tails of up to about 30 nucleotides long. If only these homogenous tails are present, then we can expect a poly(A) polymerase and not PNPase to be the major polyadenylating enzyme, similar to the situation in E. coliand unlike the case in the chloroplast. Indeed, a gene termed PAP was identified in the fully sequenced Synechocystis genome (see below). However, because only poly(A) RNA was analyzed in this experiment because of the oligo(dT) column purification step, the other possibility is that there are heterogeneous tails inSynechocystis containing only short adenosine stretches that were not purified by the oligo(dT) purification step and not detected in these experiments. To examine this possibility, we analyzed the location, length, and sequences of polyadenylated tails of this prokaryote using reverse-transcription PCR. In previous experiments, we used oligo(dT)-primed cDNA for the analysis of the chloroplast poly(A) tails (17Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although tails of several hundred nucleotides long were observed, we could not assure that the actual tails were not even longer. Therefore, we modified this procedure to analyze the full-length of the poly(A) tail. First, the RNA molecules were polyguanilated by adding GTP and the E. coli PNPase (Fig.2). The transcript was then reverse-transcribed using the d(C9T6) primer, and the cDNA was amplified using the same primer, in addition to the gene-specific one (Fig. 2). The previous oligo(dT)-primed RT-PCR method was also used, and no significant differences were obtained between the two (17Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The rbcL gene encoding the large subunit of the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase was chosen as a representative protein-encoding transcript. An inverted repeat sequence located between nucleotides 1,470 and 1,545 (counting started from the first AUG) suggested the formation of a stem-loop structure typically of prokaryotic and organelle genes at the 3′ end. Many polyadenylated tails were observed in the 3′ region of this transcript ranging in length from 15 to 172 nt (Fig. 3). Similar to the situation observed previously in the chloroplast, the polyadenylation sites were distributed throughout the analyzed region, including the amino acid coding region, the 3′ untranslated region, and the putative stem-loop structure. In addition, again similar to the situation in the chloroplast, the sequences were heterogeneous, containing 60% or more adenosines, about 15–25% guanosines, and the rest, cytidines and uridines, making them purine-rich sequences (Fig.3). The search for polyadenylated sequences at the 5′ untranslated region of the rbcL transcript revealed polyadenylation sites located in this region as well (Fig. 3). In addition, in several cases the rbcL gene-specific primers annealed to other transcripts, such as heme oxygenase, CDP glucose dehydratase, and several open reading frames related to unknown genes, revealing polyadenylation sites in these RNAs (TableI). The tails presented in Figs. 3 and4 and Table I are part of the large collection obtained throughout the course of this work. No significant differences were observed between the oligo(dT)- and the d(C9T6)-primed systems except that, as expected, the tails observed using the second system were longer.Table Ipoly(A)-rich tailed RNAs detected in several genes of SynechocystisName of geneGeneLocationLength of tailUnknownslr127093929Heme oxygenasesll1875772, 785, 812, 815, 816, 817(2), 832, 86317, 41, 18, 28, 36, 20, 21, 25, 19Unknownsll1414529, 64727, 17CDP glucose dehydrataseslr0984575, 644, 672127, 69, 79ORF376sll059788475Unknownsll092685957Unknownsll013579073Polyadenylated transcripts identified when analyzing the reverse-transcribed PCR clones using specific primers for therbcL gene.

Each clone presented here contained a nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene elongated by the poly(A)-rich tail at the indicated nucleotide (counting started from the ATG of the first methionine). The length of the tails in nucleotides is indicated. The Synechocystis genome contains one intron in the tRNAfmet gene. This single intron belongs to self-splicing group I harboring an open reading frame encoding specific DNA endonuclease (28Bonocora R.P. Shub D.A. Mol Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the degradation of spliced introns is very fast, and no polyadenylation of intron sequences has been analyzed yet, with the exception of one chloroplast intron that was characterized recently (29Vogel J. Borner T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3794-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to harbor a short poly(A) tail, we looked for polyadenylation of this transcript. Indeed, 11 polyadenylated transcripts were detected in 10 different sites of this intron (Fig.4 A). The tails were heterogonous, similar to those obtained in the rbcL transcript, and were between 16 and 128 nt long. Interestingly, no poly(A) tails were observed at the 3′ end of the intron (nucleotide number 655), which is the 3′ end resulting from the splicing event (Fig. 4 A).

In response to low sterol and other unidentified factors, SREBP cleavage-activating protein escorts SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi, where SREBPs are sequentially cleaved by Site-1 protease and Site-2 protease. The processed mature SREBPs enter the nucleus and transactivate target genes (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). Three SREBP isoforms have been identified: SREBP-1a and -1c (alternatively known as adipocyte determination and differentiation factor-1 (ADD1)) (2Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), which are derived from the same gene through alternative splicing, and SREBP-2, which is encoded by a distinct gene (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). SREBPs play an essential role in regulation of lipid homeostasis in animals and have been shown to directly activate the expression of more than 30 genes dedicated to the biosynthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, triglycerides, and phospholipids (3Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3835) Google Scholar). SREBP-1 preferentially regulates genes implicated in fatty acid synthesis, whereas SREBP-2 preferentially activates genes involved in cholesterol synthesis (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). In particular, SREBP-1c mediates insulin effects on lipogenic gene expression in both adipocytes and liver (4Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J.

Nature. 2001; 414: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (4594) Google Scholar). Affected patients are usually obese with accumulation of lipids in non-adipose tissues such as the pancreatic islets, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and blood vessels (7Unger R.H. Zhou Y.T. Orci L.

This is associated with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, increased hepatic glucose production, peripheral insulin resistance, and late complications in various organs (10Cavaghan M.K. Ehrmann D.A. Polonsky K.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 11Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The ultimate precipitating process responsible for the development of Type 2 diabetes is the failure of the pancreatic औ-cells to compensate for insulin resistance (7Unger R.H. Zhou Y.T. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 10Cavaghan M.K. Ehrmann D.A. Polonsky K.S. J. Clin.

Leptin also prevents the SREBP-1c overexpression in insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2-null mice (15Tobe K. Suzuki R. Aoyama M. Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Matsui J. Akanuma Y.

It is noteworthy that metformin, an oral antihyperglycemic agent, also corrects fatty liver disease in ob/obmice by inhibition of obesity-related induction of SREBP-1c (14Lin H.Z. Yang S.Q. Chuckaree C. Kuhajda F. Ronnet G. Diehl A.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of metformin on hepatic SREBP-1c expression involves activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (17Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4471) Google Scholar). Similarly, Troglitazone, an antidiabetic agent and a high-affinity ligand for the PPARγ, prevents SREBP-1c overexpression in Zucker diabetic fatty rats (12Kakuma T. Lee Y. Higa M. Wang Z. Pan W. Shimomura I. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently been reported that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SREBP-1c in MIN6 cells results in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (18Andreolas C. da Silva Xavier G. Diraison F. Zhao C. Varadi A. Lopez-Casillas F. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2536-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, these studies suggest that overexpression of SREBP-1c may be the cause of both liver steatosis and islet औ-cell dysfunction. The present study was designed to evaluate the direct correlation between SREBP-1c overexpression and औ-cell dysfunction and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. The Tet-On system was employed in INS-1 cells to achieve tightly controlled and inducible expression of a nuclear active form of SREBP-1c (naSREBP-1c; N-terminal 1–403 amino acids) (19Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Quantification of the gene expression profile in this INS-1 stable cell line revealed that naSREBP-1c induced औ-cell dysfunction by targeting multiple genes implicated in carbohydrate metabolism, lipid biosynthesis, cell growth, and eventually apoptosis. Rat insulinoma INS-1 cell-derived clones were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 11.2 mm glucose (20Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), unless otherwise indicated. The first step stable clone INS-rऔ cell line, which carries the reverse tetracycline/doxycycline-dependent transactivator (21Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar) was described previously (22Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The plasmid used in the secondary stable transfection were constructed by subcloning the cDNA encoding the nuclear active form of SREBP-1c (naSREBP-1c/ADD1-(1–403) (19Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), kindly supplied by Dr. B. M. Spiegelman) into the expression vector PUHD10–3 (21Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar) (a generous gift from Dr. H. Bujard). The procedures for stable transfection, clone selection and screening were described previously (22Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, cells grown on polyornithine-treated glass coverslips were treated for 24 h with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline. Cells were then washed, fixed in 47 paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.17 Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 17 BSA (PBS-BSA). The preparation was then blocked with PBS-BSA before incubating with the first antibody, anti-SREBP-1 (Santa Cruz, Basel, Switzerland) (1:100 dilution), followed by the second antibody labeling. For Western blotting cells were cultured with 0, 75, 150, and 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Rat islets were isolated by collagenase digestion as described (24Rubi B. Ishihara H. Hegardt F.G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36391-36396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and their nuclear proteins were extracted as previously reported (25Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Total cell proteins were prepared by lysis and sonication of naSREBP-1c#233 and INS-1E cells in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 17 Triton X-100, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclear extracts and total cellular proteins were fractionated by 97 SDS-PAGE. The dilution for SREBP-1 antibody is 1:1,000. Immunoblotting procedures were performed as described previously (26Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) for detection. Cells were cultured with 0, 75, 150, and 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Cells were fixed and stained as previously reported (19Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Lipid droplets were visualized using phase-contrast microscopy (Nikon Diaphot). Cellular triglyceride content was determined using Triglyceride (GPO-TRINDER) kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Insulin secretion in naSREBP-1c#233 cells was measured in 12-well plates over a period of 30 min, in Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate-HEPES buffer (KRBH, 140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 0.5 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 0.17 BSA) containing indicated concentrations of glucose. Insulin content was determined after extraction with acid ethanol following the procedures of Wanget al. (26Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin was detected by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as a standard (26Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline in 2.5 mmglucose medium for 16 h and then incubated for a further 8 h at 2.5, 6, 12, and 24 mm glucose concentrations. Alternatively, naSREBP-1c#233 cells were cultured with or without 75 ng/ml doxycycline in standard medium (11.2 mmglucose) for 0, 24, 48, and 96 h. Total RNA was extracted and blotted to nylon membranes as described previously (22Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The membrane was prehybridized and then hybridized to 32P-labeled random primer cDNA probes according to Wang and Iynedijian (22Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To ensure equal RNA loading and even transfer, all membranes were stripped and re-hybridized with a “housekeeping gene” probe cyclophilin. cDNA fragments used as probes for SREBP-1c, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1α, HNF-4α, glucokinase, Glut-2, insulin, Sur1, Kir6.2, and pancreas duodenum homeobox (Pdx-1) mRNA detection were digested from the corresponding plasmids. cDNA probes for rat islet amyloid polypeptide, Nkx6.1, adenine nucleotide translocator 1 and 2, mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, glyceraldehydes-3 phosphate dehydrogenase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, glycerol-phosphate acyltransferase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, acyl-CoA oxidase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, P21WAF1/CIP1, P27KIP1, Bax, Bad, APO-1, Cdk-4, IRS-2, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor were prepared by reverse transcription-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. Cells seeded in 24-well plates were cultured with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline in 11.2 mmglucose medium for 24, 48, and 96 h (day 1, day 2, and day 4, respectively). Cells were then maintained for 2 h in 2.5 mm glucose medium at 37 °C before loading with 10 ॖg/ml rhodamine-123 for 20 min at 37 °C in KRBH (28Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The Δψm was monitored in a plate-reader fluorimeter (Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) with excitation and emission filters set at 485 and 520 nm, respectively, at 37 °C with automated injectors for glucose (addition of 13 mm on top of basal 2.5 mm) and carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). Quantification of cell proliferation/viability was measured by a Quick Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (LabForce/MBL, Nunningen, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's protocol. This assay is based on the reduction of a tetrazolium salt WST-1 to formazan by cellular mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Expansion in the number of viable cells results in an increase in the overall activity of the mitochondrial dehydrogenases and subsequently an augmentation in the amount of formazan dye formed. The formazan dye produced by viable cells was quantified with a multiwell spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance at 440 nm. Experiments for DNA fragmentation were performed using a Quick Apoptosis DNA Ladder Detection Kit (LabForce/MBL) following the manufacturer's protocol. Detection of mitochondrial cytochromec release into cytosol was performed as described previously (29Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 15-cm dishes were harvested and suspended in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized by a Dounce homogenizer. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. The cytosolic proteins (supernatant fractions) were separated by 157 SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with a specific antibody against cytochrome c (LabForce/MBL). A rat insulinoma INS-1-derived stable cell line, INSrऔ (23Wang H. Maechler P. Ritz-Laser B. Hagenfeldt K.A. Ishihara H. Philippe J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which expresses the reverse tetracycline-dependent activator (21Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar), was used for the secondary stable transfection with an expression vector, PUHD10–3 (21Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar), carrying the naSREBP-1c and a plasmid pTKhygro containing the hygromycin-resistant marker. Five-round stable transfection experiments were performed, and a total of 400 hygromycin-resistant clones were screened by Northern blotting for clones positively expressing naSREBP-1c after doxycycline induction. Our persistent effort was rewarded. Only one clone, termed naSREBP-1c#233, which actually represented undetectable background expression under non-induced conditions, showed remarkable expression of naSREBP-1c mRNA after doxycycline induction. From experience, we would have anticipated that 10–207 of hygromycin-resistant clones should positively express the transgene. The unexpected results indicate that expression of naSREBP-1c even at leakage level was sufficient to cause “औ-cell toxicity.” The INS-1 stable cell line naSREBP-1c#233 provided a unique chance to study the impact of naSREBP-1c expression on औ-cell function. Immunofluorescence (Fig.1A) with an antibody against the N terminus of SREBP1c illustrated that nuclear localized naSREBP1c protein was induced homogeneously in naSREBP-1c#233 cells cultured with 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Western blotting (Fig. 1B) with the same antibody demonstrated that naSREBP-1c#233 cells expressed the transgene-encoded protein in a doxycycline dose-dependent manner. As predicted, naSREBP-1c#233 cells did not show detectable expression of naSREBP-1c protein under non-induced conditions (Fig. 1). The protein levels of naSREBP-1c in cells cultured with 75, 150, and 500 ng/ml were ∼107, 257, and 1507, respectively, of endogenous level of SREBP-1c precursor protein (Fig. 1B). Oil Red O staining showed that induction of naSREBP-1c with 75, 150, and 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h resulted in accumulation of lipid droplets in INS-1 cells cultured in standard medium (107 fetal calf serum) (Fig.2A). Cellular triglyceride content was increased by 397 (−Dox: 0.536 ± 0.08; +Dox: 0.745 ± 0.10 mg/mg protein, p < 0.001,n = 14) after 24 h of induction with 500 ng/ml doxycycline. Similar results were obtained in cells cultured in serum-free medium (data not shown), suggesting that the naSREBP-1c-induced lipid accumulation was not due to uptake of fatty acids by the cells. This contention was supported by results of quantitative Northern blotting. Induction of naSREBP-1c significantly increased the expression of genes dedicated to biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol but did not alter the expression of genes involved in औ-oxidation of fatty acids (Fig. 2, B andC). The increased mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, glycerol-phosphate acyltransferase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase would explain the naSREBP-1c-induced lipid accumulation. In addition, the increased lipogenesis did not raise the transcript levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and acyl-CoA oxidase, which are important for fatty acid metabolism. Induction of naSREBP1c with 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h (Fig. 3A) or 75 ng/ml doxycycline for 96 h (Fig. 3B) caused blunted glucose- and leucine-stimulated but not K+-depolarization-induced insulin secretion. Glucose generates ATP and other metabolic-coupling factors important for insulin exocytosis through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation (30Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Leucine stimulates insulin release through direct uptake and metabolism by the mitochondria, thereby providing substrates for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (30Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). K+ causes insulin secretion by depolarization of the औ-cell membrane, resulting in increased cytosolic Ca2+ (30Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To explore the molecular targets of naSREBP-1c responsible for the impaired metabolism-secretion coupling, we examined the gene expression profile in naSREBP-1c#233 cells. Quantitative Northern blotting revealed that similar induction of naSREBP1c also caused marked down-regulation of glucokinase and Glut2 but up-regulation of mitochondrial UCP-2 (Fig. 4,A and B). In contrast, naSREBP-1c did not alter the mRNA levels of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator-1 and -2, glutamate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, KATP channel subunits SUR1 and KIR6.2 (Fig. 4,A and B). Glucokinase is the rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis and thereby determines औ-cell glucose sensing (22Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,31Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The effect of naSEBP-1c on औ-glucokinase expression is opposite to its action on liver glucokinase, which is transcribed from a distinct liver-specific promoter (5Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 32Magnuson M.A. Andreone T.L. Printz R.L. Koch S. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

UCP-2 may act as a protonophore and dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby uncoupling respiration from ATP synthesis (33Boss O. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.P. Eur. J.

Induction of naSREBP1c also suppressed the expression of Pdx-1, HNF-4α, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-औ in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4, C andD). The HNF-1α expression was unaffected, whereas the mRNA level of a औ-cell transcription factor Nkx6.1 was increased by naSREBP-1c (Fig. 4, C and D). High-level induction of naSREBP-1c also decreased the transcript levels of insulin and islet amyloid polypeptide (Fig. 4C). Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), reflecting electron transport chain activity, was measured in attached cells by monitoring rhodamine-123 fluorescence. In non-induced control cells, the addition of 13 mm glucose (15.5 mmfinal) hyperpolarized Δψm and 1 ॖm the protonophore FCCP deploarized Δψm. After induction of naSREBP1c, glucose-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization was markedly inhibited as early as day 1 (24 h of induction) and completely abolished at days 2 and 4 (Fig. 5). Basal activity of the electron transport chain was progressively lost, as indicated by the dissipation of Δψm by FCCP, and completely abrogated at day 4 (Fig. 5). The mitochondrion is not only the powerhouse for cell growth and survival but also the arsenal for cell apoptosis (37Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). Disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential is an essential event that commits a cell to undergo apoptosis (38Gross A.

Intensive study of the promoter of c-fos(−325 to −80) by transient or permanent transfections of synthetic DNA constructs has repeatedly shown the importance of several sequence elements and the resident nuclear proteins that bind them (e.g. ternary complex factor/ELK1; serum response factor, cAMP response element-binding protein/amino-terminal fragment/AP-1). However these studies have left unanswered numerous questions about the role of these proteins in the regulation of the native chromosomal gene. In particular, the role of a site in this enhancer that binds STATs has been controversial. We present evidence here that STAT3 and not STAT1 accumulates on the chromosomal c-fos promoter and provides a boost to transcription without the activation of resident nuclear proteins through serine kinases. Also, when resident nuclear proteins such as ELK1 are activated to varying extents by mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, STAT3 activation provides a 2-fold boost regardless of the final level of activated transcription. Thus the several proteins that interact with the c-fos enhancer apparently can act either in a cooperative or independent manner to achieve very different levels of transcription.

Because of this initial characterization, the c-fos promoter has been extensively studied, and binding sites for several DNA binding factors have been determined to lie between −325 and −60 upstream of the c-fos start site (4Hill C.S.

Of particular note, the transfection of wild type and mutant c-fos promoter constructs has demonstrated the critical importance of the Ets and serum response elements at −320 (see Fig. 1). The Ets site is bound by ternary complex factors (TCFs),1 Ets family members (i.e. ELK1, SAP1a/b, or SAP2) that are subject to inducible serine phosphorylation (4Hill C.S. Treisman R.

In the case of ELK1, extracellular ligands stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of serine 383, leading to tighter association with serum response factor homodimers constitutively bound to the serum response element and to increased rates of transcription (8Marais R.

Histone modification of the chromatin substrate for chromosomal c-fos activation has been described recently (15Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 16Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), but the assembly of resident nuclear proteins on the c-fos promoter during gene activation has not. No firm conclusion has been reached about the importance of the SIE to the regulation of the chromosomal c-fos locus, which raises doubts about any role of the STATs in regulating c-fos transcription. On the one hand, the SIE is conserved across species (17Treisman R. Cell. 1985; 42: 889-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), and in vivo footprinting has demonstrated SIE protection within 20 min of epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation (10Herrera R.E. Shaw P.E. Nordheim A. Nature. 1989; 340: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), the SIE site can clearly bind to STAT proteins that have been activated by treatment with platelet-derived growth factor and EGF, among other cytokines (18Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 19Gronowski A.M. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Thomas M.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 171-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and reporter constructs bearing the SIE confer transient platelet-derived growth factor inducibility in the absence of the serum response element (13Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 18Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Also, mutations of this site in transiently expressed as well as stably integrated reporter constructs impair transcriptional responses not only tosis/platelet-derived growth factor but also to TPA and serum (4Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 20Robertson L.M. Kerppola T.K. Vendrell M. Luk D. Smeyne R.J. Bocchiaro C. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 241-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, other investigators have discounted the importance of STAT regulation. For example, deletion of the SIE from a luciferase construct including the TCF/serum response element/AP-1 sites failed to have any impact on EGF inducibility during the transfection of cultured HeLa cells (21Leaman D.W. Pisharody S. Flickinger T.W. Commane M.A. Schlessinger J. Kerr I.M. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition, the discovery of an overlapping TFII-I site that is required for serum induction of c-fos (Fig.1) has raised some doubts about whether the previously characterized mutations in the SIE site were the result of a loss of STAT or TFII-I function (14Kim D.W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover the SIE does not resemble an optimal STAT-binding site (13Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 22Hodge C. Liao J. Stofega M. Guan K. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol.

However, all of these transcription studies were not definitive for the native chromosomal c-fos gene. Also, the stimuli used (e.g. growth hormone or EGF) have a very significant MAP kinase component that is known to be a potent stimulus on its own (e.g. TPA treatment) (22Hodge C. Liao J. Stofega M. Guan K. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31327-31336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J.

Cell. 1996; 84: 431-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Therefore the extent to which STAT activity alone or in combination contributes to the regulation of the chromosomal gene has remained unclear. In this series of experiments, we have examined chromosomal c-fos transcription by STAT3 in the absence of detectable STAT1 or MAP kinase activity. We find that STAT3 activation alone induces c-fos mRNA accumulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that STAT3 but not STAT1 can accumulate at the c-fos promoter. This selectivity in chromatin accumulation is not the result of differences in DNA-binding preferences that are evident in in vitro DNA-binding assays, and it is presumably the result of STAT3 interaction with other nuclear proteins that are known to be on the promoter. Finally, we show that although the STAT3-associated induction of c-fos in response to human interleukin-6 (IL-6) is much weaker on its own than when induction is brought about by TPA or EGF stimulation, it maximizes the transcriptional response to either of these stimuli. HepG2 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Eagle's modified essential medium (with nonessential amino acids, Earle's salts, 2 mml-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Before all experiments, cells were serum-starved overnight with minimum Eagle's medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum. Whole and fractionated cell extracts were prepared as described previously (24Yang E. Wen Z. Haspel R.L. Zhang J.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5106-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, recombinant IL-6 (R&D Systems) was used at a concentration of 2.5 ng/ml final concentration. 12-O-tetradecanoyphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, Sigma) was resuspended in Me2SO and used at a 100 ng/ml final concentration. Recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF, Calbiochem) was used at a 100 ng/ml final concentration. Kinase inhibitors were used at 50 μm for PD098059 (MEK1 inhibitor) and 2 μm for SB203580 (p38 inhibitor). Inhibitors were added 10–15 min before stimulation with cytokine or TPA. Durations of treatments were as stated in the text. Phosphospecific antibodies for pS727-STAT3, pY705-STAT3, pT202pY204-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibody, pT183pY185-JNK, and pT180pY182-p38 were obtained from Cell Signaling and used at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting. Antibodies to the STAT1 C terminus, STAT3 C terminus, ELK1, and pS383-ELK1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. EMSAs were performed as described previously (24Yang E. Wen Z. Haspel R.L. Zhang J.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5106-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Yang E. Henriksen M.A. Schaefer O. Zakharova N. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13455-13462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Blunt-ended EMSA probes were phosphorylated by polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP to approximately the same specific activity. The sequences for the oligonucleotide probes were (sense strand): SIE, 5′-GAGCAGTTCCCGTCAATCCCT-3′; and m67, 5′-GAGCATTTCCCGTAAATCCCT-3′. Formaldehyde fixation, chromatin breakage, antibody precipitation protocols, and PCR conditions were described previously (25Yang E. Henriksen M.A. Schaefer O. Zakharova N. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13455-13462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used for precipitation: pS383 ELK1 monoclonal antibody, STAT3 C-terminal polyclonal antibody, and STAT1 C-terminal polyclonal antibody (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In the case of precipitation with monoclonal antibody, a protein A/G resin (Gamma Bind, Amersham Biosciences) was added in addition to the normal protein A, which was sheared salmon sperm slurry. The PCR primers used for the analysis of the c-fos promoter, which spanned −363 to −163 upstream of the c-fostranscription start site: CHFOSU, 5′-GCAGCCCGCGAGCAGTT-3′; and CHFOSL, 5′-GCCTTGGCGCGTGTCCTAATC-3′. The RT-PCR protocol and primers for human IRF-1 and GAPDHwere reported previously (24Yang E. Wen Z. Haspel R.L. Zhang J.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5106-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Primers for c-fos,junB, and SOCS3 were: FOSU, 5′-AACCGGAGGAGGGAGCTGACTGAT-3′ and FOSL 5′-GGGCCTGGATGATGCTGGGAACA-3′; JUNBU, 5′-CGGCGGTGGCGGCAGCTACTTTTC-3′ and JUNBL, 5′-GGGGGTGTCACGTGGTTCATCTTG-3′; and SSI3U, 5′-ACCACTACATGCCGCCCCCTGGAG-3′ and SSI3L, 5′-CCCCGGCAGCTGGGTGACTTTCTC-3′. For all samples, no detectableGAPDH amplification was detected before reverse transcription. Although 25 PCR cycles were used for the detection of any given transcript, the amount of input cDNA used was varied (see Fig. 6). A luciferase reporter construct described previously and bearing −711 to +45 of the human c-fos promoter (26Schonthal A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ponta H. Cell. 1988; 54: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) was used as a template for QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The following mutants were generated (wild type → mutant underlined): GAS-KO 5′-TTCCCGTCAA-3′ → 5′-CTCGAGTCAA-3′; M67/TFII-I KO 5′-TTCCCGTCAA-3′ → 5′-TTCCCGTAAA-3′; AP1-KO 5′-TCTGCGTCA-3′ → 5′-TCGCCGGCA-3′. Mutations were evaluated for selective removal of original binding site without detectable introduction of new sites by TRANSFAC. 2www.transfac.gbf.ed/dbsearch/clustalw.html. All clones used for reporter analysis were sequenced over the length of the promoter. Transfections were performed in six-well plates with 3 μl of Fugene (Roche Applied Science) and 1 μg of DNA (66 ng of reporter plasmid, 333 ng of cytomegalovirus-enhanced green fluorescent protein, 222 ng of cytomegalovirus-β- galactosidase, and 377 ng of RC/cytomegalovirus expression plasmid)/well. After a 4-h transfection, cells were allowed to recover for 18–24 h and then starved for 15–18 h in a low serum (0.2% fetal calf serum) medium. Cells were then activated in duplicate with IL-6 for 3.5 h, TPA for 3 h, IL-6 for 0.5 h followed by TPA for 3 h, or left untreated. Luciferase assays were performed according to manufacturer directions (Promega). Because conditions that activate c-fos were found to also markedly and consistently increase β- galactosidase expression, the average β- galactosidase activity for the two untreated samples was used to normalize the transfections. The error bars represent half of the difference between duplicate measurements. Previous studies of STAT activation of the c-fos promoter have often made use of ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases that activate several signaling pathways in addition to the STATs (1–7; see the Introduction). Therefore the strong activation of the c-fos promoter by MAP kinases might obscure the impact of the STATs on the regulation of this locus. Furthermore, many ligands activate both STAT1 and STAT3. We dissected the contribution of different STATs from each other and from MAP kinases by using IL-6 at low concentrations that activated STAT3 preferentially to STAT1 (Fig.2 A); 2.5 ng/ml IL-6 affords near maximal activation of STAT3 with only a trace of activated STAT1. Because in some cell types IL-6 activates MAP kinase signaling (27Hirano T. Thomson A.W. The Cytokine Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 197-228Google Scholar) and might contribute to c-fos activation through this route, we determined the extent of MAP kinase activation in HepG2 cells under conditions of low-dose IL-6 treatment. Western blotting with phosphospecific antibodies to various MAP kinases and ELK1 established that the level of IL-6 treatment used does not lead to detectable MAP kinase activity (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–3). Likewise, treatment with TPA, which stimulates various serine kinases, did not lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4and 5). Thus the two activators, IL-6 and TPA, apparently act through different signaling pathways under these conditions. As reported previously, simultaneous co-treatment with TPA blocks IL-6-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (28Sengupta T.K. Talbot E.S. Scherle P.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). STAT3 serine phosphorylation was found to be sensitive to application of the MEK1 inhibitor PD098059 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7–12), thereby precluding the use of MAP kinase inhibitors to completely remove the possibility of low level activation. In all cases in Fig. 2, equal loading was confirmed by stripping the Western blots and probing for equal STAT3 or ELK1 immunoreactivity (data not shown). As judged by RT-PCR assays of mRNA concentration (Fig.2 C), TPA treatment led to a very large induction of the chromosomal c-fos gene, whereas a much smaller induction (∼5%) of the c-fos gene followed IL-6 treatment (Fig.2 C). Similar patterns were also observed forjunB, an immediate early gene also thought to be subject to regulation by STAT3 (29Coffer P. Lutticken C. van Puijenbroek A. Klop-de Jonge M. Horn F. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 985-994PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The IL-6-mediated stimulation of the c-fos and junB genes was attenuated by the addition of the kinase inhibitor PD098059, suggesting potential sensitivity of these promoters to STAT3 serine phosphorylation, a modification known to be required for maximal STAT3 transcriptional activity (30Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). This sensitivity to PD098059 was also observed for SOCS3, a target gene insensitive to TPA stimulation alone (data not shown). Although the data shown in Fig. 2 suggested that IL-6-dependent STAT3 activation of c-fostranscription is possible, definitive proof required more sensitive examination of MAP kinase activity and direct evidence for binding to the chromosomal c-fos promoter by STAT3. We therefore sought a highly sensitive indicator of MAP kinase activity in HepG2 cells. With two c-fos copies per cell, we reasoned that c-fos promoter-bound phosphorylated ELK1, the terminal substrate of the various MAP kinases, should provide a sensitive marker for p38, ERK1/2, or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity (31Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-pS383-ELK1 antibodies showed the presence of serine phosphorylated ELK1 on the promoter after 30 min of TPA treatment but not after IL-6 treatment (Fig.4 A, lanes 6–8), suggesting again that IL-6 does not activate a serine kinase cascade that reaches the c-fos promoter. Therefore the IL-6 activation of the chromosomal c-fos gene is most likely to occur through STAT3. We then turned to the importance of STAT3 compared with STAT1 as an activator of c-fos by doing chromatin precipitation with various antibodies both on the c-fospromoter and the IRF-1 promoter, which is a gene activated by IFNγ through the activation of STAT1. RT-PCR demonstrated that IL-6 treatment leads to c-fos mRNA accumulation with minimal or no IRF-1 accumulation, and IFNγ leads to accumulation of IRF-1 mRNA but not c-fos mRNA (Fig. 3). We then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments of the c-fos and IRF promoters. The anti-STAT3 antibody precipitated both c-fos and IRF-1 promoter DNA after 30 min of IL-6 treatment (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–3). On the other hand, activation for 30 min with the STAT1-specific cytokine IFNγ led to STAT1 accumulation at the IRF-1 promoter but not the c-fos promoter (Fig. 4 A,lanes 4 and 5). As a control, precipitation of an internal segment of the c-fos coding region was found not to precipitate with either antibody (data not shown). Thus STAT3 accumulates at the c-fos promoter after IL-6 treatment, but STAT1 does not, which indicates a specificity for STAT3 over STAT1. On the other hand, both STAT3 and STAT1 accumulate on the IRF-1promoter, but only STAT1 accumulation correlates with actual transcriptional activation (Fig. 3). Both STAT3 and STAT1 are known to bind to the SIE site in EMSA DNA binding assays (18Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar,32Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Therefore the discovery of selective STAT3 retention at the c-fos locus during transcriptional activation raises two possibilities. One possibility is that STAT3 has decreased kinetics of DNA dissociation compared with STAT1 with similarK d. For a previously reported STAT1 linker mutant, this sort of change in kinetics compared with wild type led to impaired chromatin accumulation and transcriptional inactivity (25Yang E. Henriksen M.A. Schaefer O. Zakharova N. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13455-13462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that STAT3 interacts with other proteins present at the c-fos promoter that serve to retain it. We therefore repeated the observation that STAT1 and STAT3 bind approximately equally (18Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar) in EMSA analysis with either the SIE from the c-fos gene (Fig.5 A, left) or a mutated version of this site (variously termed M67 or hSIE) that has increased binding for the STATs (Fig. 5 A, right). We then examined the off-rate of DNA binding by exposure of the DNA– protein complex to unlabeled probe for the SIE site (m67 provided as reference) (Fig. 5 B). The SIE exhibits rapid and equal protein-DNA dissociation kinetics for both STAT1 and STAT3. Therefore STAT3-specific accumulation on the c-fos promoter (see Fig. 4 A) does not rely on a markedly different dissociation rate of STAT3 compared with STAT1, which strongly suggests protein interaction between STAT3 and other proteins on the promoter as the basis for stable STAT3 binding and chromatin accumulation. Given the weak induction of the c-fos gene by IL-6 alone, we examined the effect of IL-6 treatment after co-treatment with TPA or the natural polypeptide activator, EGF. As mentioned earlier, TPA treatment has the effect of blocking STAT3 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. To achieve near simultaneous activation of STAT3 and proteins activated by TPA/EGF, we pretreated cells with IL-6 for 5–30 min before a 30-min TPA or EGF treatment and then examined c-fos mRNA accumulation (Fig. 6). Although both TPA and EGF result in much stronger c-fos mRNA accumulation, the IL-6 pretreatment resulted in an ∼2-fold boost to the large TPA or EGF inductions. (To demonstrate this difference the RT-PCR reaction was carried out under non-saturating conditions.) We also carried out a transfection experiment to examine the supplemental effect of IL-6 on TPA-induced transcription (Fig.7) using a luciferase reporter assay. Once again, under conditions of acute transfection there was an ∼2-fold boost in signal by IL-6 compared with TPA alone. This effect required an intact SIE site indicating the critical importance of STAT3 binding to the IL-6 supplementation. This work addresses several different questions about activation of the chromosomal c-fos promoter. First, it has been concluded from many transfection (permanent and transient) experiments that the serum response factor-ELK1 complex, likely also including the nearby AP-1 proteins, is required for the optimal transcriptional response to growth factors and to phorbol esters (TPA). Yet there was also evidence from transfections that a STAT site (SIE) had a role in the regulation of c-fos. Whether activity of the chromosomal gene depended on this latter element was not settled. In these studies, we examined the role of the SIE in the regulation of the endogenous c-fos locus. We first uncoupled stimulation of the STAT proteins from the MAP kinase induction of the chromosomal gene by using low levels of IL-6. IL-6 treatment leads to STAT3 activation with little STAT1 activation, and IL-6 does not induce phosphorylation of ELK1 at the c-foslocus as does TPA, as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Thus we conclude that IL-6 treatment alone induces c-fos gene transcription in the absence of demonstrable MAP kinase activation. Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation established that IL-6 stimulation correlates with binding by STAT3. Even though the IL-6 induction of c-fos was ∼20-fold less than that stimulated by TPA or EGF, it is clear that IL-6 treatment augments by 2–3-fold either TPA or EGF stimulation of c-fos transcription. Our experiments also shed light on mechanisms for inducing STAT1- or STAT3-specific activation of chromosomal genes. For a number of years, it has been clear that STAT3 and STAT1 have opposing roles in growth control; STAT3 is activated in proliferative states and STAT1 in growth arrest (33Bromberg J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). However, the virtually identical DNA binding specificities of these two STATs have raised the question of how these opposing signals are interpreted at the DNA level (34Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Using the c-fos and IRF-1 genes, we demonstrate two ways that such a conundrum can be resolved. In the case of c-fos, both STAT3 and STAT1 bind weakly to the nonoptimal SIE site, but only STAT3 is retained at the promoter, presumably because of protein contacts made by STAT3 that are not made by STAT1 (Fig. 4). Thus, IL-6 activates transcription of the c-fos gene and IFNγ does not. In the case of IRF-1, a perfect STAT site is present in the promoter ∼150 bp from the start site, and both activated STAT3 and STAT1 bind to the chromatin at this site. However, only IFNγ (through STAT1) leads to strong induction of the IRF-1promoter. Although both STATs are retained on the chromatin, only STAT1 activates transcription. It should also be noted that these specificities of transcriptional regulation make physiological sense, because c-fos is a proto-oncogene and IRF-1 is a proapoptosis gene, which fits the consensus for roles of STAT3 and STAT1 (2Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar, 35Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Kitagawa M. Harada H. Kimura T. Matsuyama T. Lamphier M.S. Aizawa S. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1994; 77: 829-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Therefore STAT specificity at the promoter level can be determined by selective factor retention or selective factor activity. We speculate that other transcriptionally active proteins bound to adjacent sites on these two promoters may govern this selective accumulation and activity of the STAT1 and STAT3 molecules. For example, c-Jun, which interacts more strongly with STAT3 than STAT1 (36Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), could be constitutively present on the AP-1 site(s) in the c-fos promoter and may help immobilize STAT3. How do these findings affect thinking about the enhanceosome concept popularized by studies on the IFNβ and TCRα gene promoters (37Carey M. Cell. 1998; 92: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In those two cases, multiple proteins are bound to short DNA segments and apparently physically interact with high spatial specificity in order for fulsome transcriptional activation of the two genes. Previous work with stably integrated c-fos reporter constructs suggested that a productive transcriptional response from c-fosrequires the SIE, AP-1, and serum response element to work in concert in a manner similar to the IFNβ and TCRα gene enhanceosomes (20Robertson L.M. Kerppola T.K. Vendrell M. Luk D. Smeyne R.J. Bocchiaro C. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 241-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In our experiments, there may be protein-protein interaction on the c-fos promoter between activated STAT3 and other constitutively bound proteins. But the activation by serine phosphorylation of ELK1, a necessary event in TPA and EGF stimulation of transcription, does not have to occur in STAT3-driven transcription of c-fos. (Figs. 3 and 4). Nonetheless, simultaneous action of STAT3 and phospho-ELK1 (plus perhaps other serine phosphorylations) does appear to maximize the transcriptional output from c-fos. So even though large inductions are possible in the absence of bound STAT3, maximal inductions may require simultaneous binding and phosphorylation of constitutive factors and of STAT3. This arrangement seems appropriate, because many growth factors which activate MAP kinases are also sources of STAT3 activation (38Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). We thank Lois Cousseau for assistance with manuscript preparation. We also thank Peter Shaw for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1974712482,"The PXIXIT calcineurin binding motif or highly related sequences are found in a variety of calcineurin-binding proteins in yeast, mammalian cells, and viruses. The accessory protein p12I encoded in the HTLV-1 pX ORF I promotes T cell activation during the early stages of HTLV-1 infection by activating nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) through calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. We identified in p12I, a conserved motif, which is highly homologous with the PXIXIT calcineurin-binding motif of NFAT. Both immunoprecipitation and calmodulin agarose bead pull-down assays indicated that wild type p12I and mutants of p12I that contained the motif-bound calcineurin. In addition, an alanine substitution p12I mutant (p12I AXAXAA) had greatly reduced binding affinity for calcineurin. We then tested whether p12I binding to calcineurin affected NFAT activity. p12I competed with NFAT for calcineurin binding in calmodulin bead pull-down experiments. Furthermore, the p12I AXAXAA mutant enhanced NFAT nuclear translocation compared with wild type p12I and increased NFAT transcriptional activity 2-fold greater than wild type p12I. Similar to NFAT, endogenous calcineurin phosphatase activity was increased in Jurkat T cells expressing p12Iindependent of its calcineurin binding property. Thus, the reduced binding of p12I to calcineurin allows enhanced nuclear translocation and transcription mediated by NFAT. Herein, we are the first to identify a retroviral protein that binds calcineurin. Our data suggest that HTLV-1 p12I modulates NFAT activation to promote early virus infection of T lymphocytes, providing a novel mechanism for retrovirus-mediated cell activation. The PXIXIT calcineurin binding motif or highly related sequences are found in a variety of calcineurin-binding proteins in yeast, mammalian cells, and viruses. The accessory protein p12I encoded in the HTLV-1 pX ORF I promotes T cell activation during the early stages of HTLV-1 infection by activating nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) through calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. We identified in p12I, a conserved motif, which is highly homologous with the PXIXIT calcineurin-binding motif of NFAT. Both immunoprecipitation and calmodulin agarose bead pull-down assays indicated that wild type p12I and mutants of p12I that contained the motif-bound calcineurin. In addition, an alanine substitution p12I mutant (p12I AXAXAA) had greatly reduced binding affinity for calcineurin. We then tested whether p12I binding to calcineurin affected NFAT activity. p12I competed with NFAT for calcineurin binding in calmodulin bead pull-down experiments. Furthermore, the p12I AXAXAA mutant enhanced NFAT nuclear translocation compared with wild type p12I and increased NFAT transcriptional activity 2-fold greater than wild type p12I. Similar to NFAT, endogenous calcineurin phosphatase activity was increased in Jurkat T cells expressing p12Iindependent of its calcineurin binding property. Thus, the reduced binding of p12I to calcineurin allows enhanced nuclear translocation and transcription mediated by NFAT. Herein, we are the first to identify a retroviral protein that binds calcineurin.

The understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection, immortalization, and transformation has been primarily focused on the role of Tax and Rex (5Mesnard J.M. Devaux C.

A small hydrophobic protein, p12I, contains several potential functional motifs, including two transmembrane domains, leucine zipper motifs, and four Src homology 3 domain-binding motifs (PXXP) (2Koralnik I.J.

However, defined motifs of p12I that may alter key T cell signaling pathways that thereby influence cell activation have not been identified. We have reported that p12I is required for early establishment of HTLV-1 infection (19Collins N.D. Newbound G.C. Albrecht B. Beard J.L. Ratner L. Lairmore M.D. Blood. 1998; 91: 4701-4707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Albrecht B. Collins N.D. Burniston M.T. Nisbet J.W. Ratner L. Green P.L. Lairmore M.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9828-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). When compared with the wild type infectious molecular clone (ACH), ORF I-mutated ACH-immortalized T cell lines (ACH·p12I) failed to establish infection in rabbits (21Collins N.D. Newbound G.C.

ACH·p12I also exhibited reduced infectivity in quiescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells but not in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting a role for p12I in T cell activation during the early stages of infection (20Albrecht B. Collins N.D. Burniston M.T. Nisbet J.W. Ratner L. Green P.L. Lairmore M.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9828-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that p12Ilocalizes to the ER and associates with an ER luminal protein, calreticulin (12Ding W. Albrecht B. Luo R. Zhang W. Stanley J.R. Newbound G.C. Lairmore M.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7672-7682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and selectively activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in a calcium-dependent manner (12Ding W. Albrecht B. Luo R. Zhang W. Stanley J.R. Newbound G.C. Lairmore M.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7672-7682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,23Albrecht B. D'Souza C.D. Ding W. Tridandapani S. Coggeshall K.M. Lairmore M.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3493-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Importantly, p12I expression in lymphocytes directly increases cytoplasmic calcium from ER calcium stores (12Ding W. Albrecht B. Luo R. Zhang W. Stanley J.R. Newbound G.C. Lairmore M.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7672-7682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Ding W. Albrecht B. Kelley R.E. Muthusamy N. Kim S. Altschuld R.A. Lairmore M.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10374-10382Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which serves to explain how the protein activates the NFAT signaling pathway. The transcriptional activation of NFAT is regulated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin (25Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Amasaki Y. Arai K. Arai N. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Through protein-protein interaction, calcineurin triggers the dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of NFAT, which results in transactivation of NFAT-inducible cytokine genes including interleukin-2 (25Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Amasaki Y. Arai K. Arai N. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). A conserved calcineurin-binding motif (PXIXIT) has been identified in the N-terminal regulatory domain of NFAT, which serves as a major binding site with both inactivated and activated calcineurin (27Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 28Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A.

Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition, secondary calcineurin binding sites in NFAT have been identified that contribute to higher affinity binding with calcineurin (29Garcia-Cozar F.J. Okamura H. Aramburu J.F. Shaw K.T.

The NFAT SPRIEIT calcineurin binding sequence and synthetic peptides containing the critical binding amino acids (PXIXIT) inhibit binding between calcineurin and NFAT without affecting calcineurin phosphatase activity (27Aramburu J.

A number of calcineurin-binding proteins inhibit either calcineurin phosphatase activity or its substrate NFAT transcriptional activity. These include the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (31Shibasaki F.

Interestingly, the African swine fever virus immunosuppressive protein A238L inhibits NFAT activation and has a calcineurin binding sequence resembling that of NFAT (36Miskin J.E. Abrams C.C. Goatley L.C. Dixon L.K. Science. 1998; 281: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 37Miskin J.E. Abrams C.C. Dixon L.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9412-9420Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Herein, we identified a conserved sequence (PSLP(I/L)T) in p12I, which is highly homologous to the PXIXIT calcineurin-binding motif of NFAT. Full-length p12I and the PSLP(I/L)T motif-containing mutants bound calcineurin in both immunoprecipitation and calmodulin bead pull-down assays. In contrast, serial mutations of p12I that lacked PSLP(I/L)T motif or had selective alanine substitutions of the motif (p12IAXAXAA) exhibited abolished or decreased binding affinity with calcineurin. Furthermore, p12I competed with NFAT for calcineurin binding in calmodulin bead pull-down experiments. Interestingly, the p12I AXAXAA mutant induced more NFAT nuclear translocation than wild type and increased NFAT transcriptional activity (∼2-fold) in a reporter gene assay when compared with wild type p12I. The existence of a calcineurin binding motif in p12I suggests that there may be at least two regulatory actions for p12I that modulate NFAT activation: 1) to cause calcium release from ER stores and 2) through calcineurin binding. Collectively, our data provide new insight into the role of a retroviral accessory protein in mediating early events in T cell infection and activation. The 293T HEK (American Type Culture Collection catalog no. 1573) cells and HeLa-Tat cells (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health, HLtat, catalog no. 1293) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg of streptomycin plus penicillin/ml, and 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen). Jurkat T cells (clone E6-1; American Type Culture Collection catalog no. TIB-152) were maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg of streptomycin plus penicillin/ml, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen) (complete RPMI). pME18S and pMEp12I plasmids were kindly provided by G. Franchini (National Institute of Health) (14Koralnik I.J. Fullen J. Franchini G. J.

Rao, Harvard Medical School) was used for NFAT expression in 293T and HeLa-Tat cell lines. The serial deletion mutants of p12I (1–47, 48–99, 15–69, and 15–86) were previously described (12Ding W. Albrecht B. Luo R. Zhang W. Stanley J.R. Newbound G.C. Lairmore M.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7672-7682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Point mutants of p12I were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Point mutant L74I was made by substituting the 74th leucine residue to isoleucine within the 99-amino acid sequence of p12I. Point mutant p12IAXAXAA was made by multiple alanine substitution of the PXLXLT motif (e.g. 70th proline to alanine, 71st leucine to alanine, 73rd leucine to alanine, and 75th threonine to alanine) motif. To construct the L74I mutant, 5′-CCTCAGCCCGTCGCTGCCGATCACGATGCGTTTCCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGGAAACGCATCGTGATCGGCAGCGACGGGCTGAGG-3′ primers were used. To construct the p12I AXAXAA mutant, 5′-CCTCTTCTCCTCAGCGCGTCGGCGCCGGCAGCGATGCGTTTCCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGGAAACGCATCGCTGCCGGCGCCGACGCGCTGAGGAGAAGAGG-3′ primers were used. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm that the sequences of each p12I mutant plasmids were correct and in frame. An NFAT-luciferase construct, pNFAT-luc, which has a trimerized human distal interleukin-2 NFAT site inserted into the minimal interleukin-2 promoter, was used for the reporter gene assay (38Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 293T cells were seeded at 50% confluence in 10-cm-diameter tissue culture dishes 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of pME18S, wild type pMEp12I, and mutants of p12I using LipofectAMINETM reagent (12Ding W. Albrecht B. Luo R. Zhang W. Stanley J.R. Newbound G.C. Lairmore M.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7672-7682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen). For Jurkat T cell transfection, 107 cells were electroporated in complete RPMI (350 V, 975 microfarads; Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II) with 30 μg of pME18S, wild type pMEp12Iand mutant expression vectors. To test the binding between p12I and calcineurin, 293T cells or Jurkat T cells were transfected with wild type pMEp12I or mutated p12I expression vectors. Transfected 293T cells (1–2 × 107) or Jurkat T cells (1 × 107) were lysed with Triton X-100 buffer (1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), with Complete® Protease Inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). CaCl2 (2 mm), EDTA (5 mm), or EGTA (5 mm) were added to test the calcium chelation effect in p12I and calcineurin binding. Cell lysates were incubated with 1:200 diluted rabbit polyclonal calcineurin antibody (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecular, CA) overnight. The immune complex mixture was then incubated with 50 μl of protein A/G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 4 h. Beads were washed three times in Triton X-100 buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and supernatants were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. To test pharmacological inhibitors in a p12I and calcineurin binding assay, cyclosporin A (Sigma) (10 μm) or glycine,N,N′-1,2-ethanediylbis(oxy-2,1-phenylene)-bis-N-2-(acetyloxy)methoxy-2-oxoethyl-, bis(acetyloxy)methyl ester (BAPTA-AM; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (1 μm) were added in culture 30 min before cell lysis. To test p12I binding with calcineurin and to test for competition between p12I and NFAT for calcineurin binding, a calmodulin bead assay was performed as previously described (39Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells or Jurkat T cells were transfected with wild type pMEp12I or mutated p12I expression vectors or an NFAT expression vector. Transfected 293T (2 × 107) or Jurkat T cell (1 × 107) were lysed in Triton X-100 buffer (1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), with Complete® protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) with CaCl2 (2 mm). Calmodulin-agarose (phosphodiesterase 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotide activator from bovine brain) beads (Sigma) were washed three times in 1 ml of preactivation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2) to activate calmodulin. Lysates were then incubated with 60 μl of packed beads for 3 h at 4 °C. To remove unbound proteins, the beads were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors supplemented with CaCl2 (2 mm)). The beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and supernatants were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. Western immunoblotting was used to analyze immunoprecipitated and calmodulin bead pull-down products. Protein concentrations in all lysates were determined by BCA assay (micro-BCA Protein Assay; Pierce). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h, incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:1000) (clone 16B-12;Covance Research Products), with polyclonal calcineurin antibody (1:1000) (Chemicon International) or with monoclonal NFAT1c antibody (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for detection of p12I, calcineurin, and NFAT2 (23Albrecht B.

The blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA). The density of each band was measured using a commercial software package (Gel-pro Analyzer software; Media Cybernetic, Inc., Silver Spring, MD). For analysis of NFAT transcriptional activity in wild type pMEp12I and alanine-substituted mutant (p12IAXAXAA) transfected Jurkat T cells, NFAT-driven luciferase activity assay was performed as previously described (23Albrecht B. D'Souza C.D. Ding W. Tridandapani S. Coggeshall K.M. Lairmore M.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3493-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat T cells (107) were electroporated as described above with 30 μg of expression vectors (pME18S, pMEp12I, or p12I AXAXAA mutant), 10 μg of reporter plasmid (NFAT-luc), and 1 μg of pCMV·SPORT-β-gal to normalize for transfection efficiency. The transfected cells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 5 × 105/ml. Cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) at 6 h post-transfection. After 18 h of stimulation, cells were lysed (Cell Culture Lysis Reagent;Promega, Madison, WI) and analyzed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Values were normalized for transfection efficiency based on β-galactosidase activity. Data expressed in reporter gene assays were the mean of at least two independent experiments conducted in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. HeLa-Tat cells were seeded into chamber slides (Fisher) and were cotransfected with 2 μg of HA-NFAT1c-GFP expression vector (28Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and 4 μg pME18S, pMEp12I, or p12I AXAXAA mutant expression vectors. Two days post-transfection, cells were fixed for 15 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and were visualized by an Olympus BH-2 fluorescence microscope or Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. To quantify the HA-NFAT1c-GFP nuclear localization, cells that had sole or predominant nuclear fluorescence were counted as positive cells. Values were obtained from two wells of a single representative experiment (∼600 cells). To measure GFP intensity in cytoplasmic and nuclear regions, MetaMorph® Imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA) was used. Values represent nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of GFP intensity of up to 25 cells. Endogenous calcineurin phosphatase activity of Jurkat cells was measured by using the calcineurin assay kit (Biomol; Plymouth Meeting, PA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 107 Jurkat cells were transfected with 30 μg of expression vectors (pME18S, pMEp12I, or p12I AXAXAA mutant). At 24 h post-transfection, phosphatase activity was measured using phosphopeptide substrate (RII peptide) in the presence or absence of EGTA. The released free PO4 was measured colorimetrically by using the Biomol Green reagent. The peptide alignment of p12Isequences with the calcineurin binding peptide sequence from NFAT (SPRIEIT) was carried out using a commercial software package (Align X software of the Vector NTI suite; InforMax Inc., Bethesda, MD). We compared p12I sequences from pMEp12I plasmid, ACH molecular proviral clone, and five different p12Isequences from the Entrez protein data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). We identified a highly conserved70PSLP(I/L)T75 sequence in p12I(Fig. 1). p12I sequences from various HTLV-1 strains had nearly identical sequences compared with the consensus calcineurin binding PXIXIT sequence of NFAT except the 72nd leucine residue. The pMEp12I plasmid was the only clone that had a leucine residue at amino acid 74. This putative calcineurin-binding motif is also conserved in the closely related simian T cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1) p12I(40Saksena N.K. Srinivasan A. Ge Y.C. Xiang S.H. Azad A. Bolton W.

However, the accessory proteins R3 and G4 of bovine leukemia virus, also a member of the Deltaretrovirus group, did not share these consensus sequences (41Lefebvre L. Ciminale V. Vanderplasschen A.

In calcium-containing buffer, calmodulin beads precipitated both calcineurin and its binding protein NFAT (39Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). p12I was consistently pulled down in calmodulin-agarose bead and immunoprecipitation assays (Fig.2 B). Thus, p12I, as a full-length protein, had the capacity to bind endogenously expressed calcineurin in both 293T and Jurkat T cells. As expected, using the pMEp12I vector, the detected p12I in higher percentage SDS gels (15%) showed typical doublet bands as described (18Trovato R. Mulloy J.C. Johnson J.M. Takemoto S. Deoliveira M.P. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6460-6467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two forms of p12I may be due to post-translational modification of p12I, such as phosphorylation or ubiquitylation (18Trovato R. Mulloy J.C. Johnson J.M. Takemoto S. Deoliveira M.P. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6460-6467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To define the regions in p12I that are responsible for binding with calcineurin, we tested serially deleted p12Imutants for calcineurin binding (Fig. 2 A). The mutants p12I 48–99, p12I 15–86, and p12I15–69 bound calcineurin in immunoprecipitation and calmodulin bead pull-down assays (Fig. 2 B). However, the mutant p12I 1–47 (the N-terminal half of p12I) failed to bind calcineurin in either assay (Fig. 2 B). These data indicated that amino acids 48–99 of p12I, which contains the putative calcineurin-binding (70PSLP(I/L)T75) motif, was probably responsible for calcineurin binding. The mutant p12I15–69, which did not contain the putative calcineurin binding motif, weakly bound to calcineurin (Fig. 2 B). This finding was not unexpected, because secondary calcineurin binding sites are predicted from the p12I amino acid sequence when compared with homologous alignment of secondary binding sequences of NFAT (data not shown). To more specifically test whether the calcineurin-binding region in p12I was due to the PSLP(I/L)T motif, we constructed an alanine substitution mutant of p12I (p12I AXAXAA) and carried out immunoprecipitation and calmodulin bead pull-down assays (Fig. 3). These substitutions were designed to rep"

For example, methylation of histone H3 at lysine 79 (H3-meK79) has been implicated recently in gene silencing inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the distribution and function of H3-meK79 in mammalian chromatin are not known. We found that H3-meK79 has a variable distribution within the murine β-globin locus in adult erythroid cells, being preferentially enriched at the active βmajor gene. By contrast, acetylated H3 and H4 and H3 methylated at lysine 4 were enriched both at βmajorand at the upstream locus control region. H3-meK79 was also enriched at the active cad gene, whereas the transcriptionally inactive loci necdin and MyoD1 contained very little H3-meK79. As the pattern of H3-meK79 at the β-globin locus differed between adult and embryonic erythroid cells, establishment and/or maintenance of H3-meK79 was developmentally dynamic. Genetic complementation analysis in null cells lacking the erythroid and megakaryocyte-specific transcription factor p45/NF-E2 showed that p45/NF-E2 preferentially establishes H3-meK79 at theβmajor promoter. These results support a model in which H3-meK79 is strongly enriched in mammalian chromatin at active genes but not uniformly throughout active chromatin domains. As H3-meK79 is highly regulated at the β-globin locus, we propose that the murine ortholog of Disruptor of Telomeric Silencing-1-like (mDOT1L) methyltransferase, which synthesizes H3-meK79, regulates β-globin transcription.

Cell. 2000; 11: 3601-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mutation of Lys-79 and mutations that abrogate DOT1 catalytic activity impair telomeric silencing (26Ng H.H. Feng Q. Wang H.

Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), indicating that DOT1 mediates telomeric silencing via methylation of Lys-79. Taken together with results that H3-meK79 is abundant in bulk yeast histones and is deficient from telomeres, it has been proposed that H3-meK79 excludes silent information regulator (SIR) complexes (27van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). SIR complexes assemble at telomeres and mediate heterochromatin formation (35Gasser S.M. Cockell M.M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The model assumes that H3-meK79 excludes SIR proteins from the bulk of genomic DNA, thus yielding sufficient amounts of SIR proteins to assemble repressive complexes at heterochromatic sites.The studies described above have led to a compelling model to explain the functional consequences of H3-meK79 in yeast. However, given the considerably larger size of mammalian genomes versus the yeast genome, it would be striking if all active chromatin regions require H3-meK79 to prevent SIR-mediated heterochromatization. The distribution of H3-meK79 in mammalian chromatin has not been determined. Thus, we developed a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to measure H3-meK79 levels at a mammalian chromatin domain, the erythroid-specific murine β-globin locus, and at other functionally distinct sites of mammalian chromatin. Although the distribution of H3-meK79 at these sites is consistent with the model in which H3-meK79 is enriched at active promoters, surprisingly, H3-meK79 levels were highly variable throughout the active β-globin domain in adult erythroid cells. As H3-meK79 levels were dynamically regulated by the hematopoietic activator p45/NF-E2 and differed between adult and embryonic erythroid cells, H3-meK79 is likely to be an important determinant of β-globin gene expression.

An almost endless number of histone modifications has been documented, and it has been hypothesized that a histone code exists in which unique combinations of histone modifications confer distinct functional consequences (1Strahl B.D.

H3 dimethylated at Lys-4 is enriched within coding regions of transcribed genes in yeast, and this modification is established by the methyltransferase Set1 (22Bernstein B.E. Humphrey E.L.

A more recent analysis in yeast revealed that H3 dimethylated at Lys-4 was enriched at active and inactive genes, whereas H3 trimethylated at Lys-4 marked only active genes (23Santos-Rosa H.

The functional consequences of H3-meK4 include inhibiting interaction of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase repressor complex with the amino terminus of H3; H3-meK9 does not prevent nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase repressor complex binding (24Nishioka K.

In addition to acetylation and methylation of Lys-4 and Lys-9 within the amino terminus of histone H3, H3 is modified in the central globular domain by methylation at Lys-79 (26Ng H.H. Feng Q.

DOT1 was also identified as a regulator of the pachytene checkpoint, which ensures proper chromosome segregation during the meiotic cell cycle (34San-Segundo P.A. Roeder G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3601-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mutation of Lys-79 and mutations that abrogate DOT1 catalytic activity impair telomeric silencing (26Ng H.H. Feng Q. Wang H.

Taken together with results that H3-meK79 is abundant in bulk yeast histones and is deficient from telomeres, it has been proposed that H3-meK79 excludes silent information regulator (SIR) complexes (27van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). SIR complexes assemble at telomeres and mediate heterochromatin formation (35Gasser S.M. Cockell M.M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The model assumes that H3-meK79 excludes SIR proteins from the bulk of genomic DNA, thus yielding sufficient amounts of SIR proteins to assemble repressive complexes at heterochromatic sites. The studies described above have led to a compelling model to explain the functional consequences of H3-meK79 in yeast. However, given the considerably larger size of mammalian genomes versus the yeast genome, it would be striking if all active chromatin regions require H3-meK79 to prevent SIR-mediated heterochromatization. The distribution of H3-meK79 in mammalian chromatin has not been determined. Thus, we developed a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to measure H3-meK79 levels at a mammalian chromatin domain, the erythroid-specific murine β-globin locus, and at other functionally distinct sites of mammalian chromatin. Although the distribution of H3-meK79 at these sites is consistent with the model in which H3-meK79 is enriched at active promoters, surprisingly, H3-meK79 levels were highly variable throughout the active β-globin domain in adult erythroid cells. As H3-meK79 levels were dynamically regulated by the hematopoietic activator p45/NF-E2 and differed between adult and embryonic erythroid cells, H3-meK79 is likely to be an important determinant of β-globin gene expression.

This is in contrast to its most extensively characterized in vitro ligand, the small calcium-binding protein S100A6 (calcyclin), which is concentrated in the nuclear envelope. Here we have examined the significance of the association of annexin 11 and S100A6 by asking whether circumstances exist in which the two proteins occupy the same subcellular localization. First, we show that in both A431 and vascular smooth muscle cells, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ leads to translocation of annexin 11 from the nucleus to the nuclear envelope where it co-localizes with S100A6. We also demonstrate, using fusions of annexin 11 with green fluorescent protein, that whereas the C-terminal core domain of annexin 11 is essential for Ca2+ sensitivity, the N-terminal domain is required for targeting to the nuclear envelope. Second, we show that annexin 11 relocalizes to the nuclear envelope as A431 cells transit from early to mid-prophase. In late prophase, at the time of nuclear envelope breakdown, annexin 11 and S100A6 become intensely localized with lamina-associated polypeptide 2 to folds in the nuclear envelope. From metaphase to telophase S100A6 is degraded, but in late telophase annexin 11 associates with the reforming nuclear envelope before resuming a nucleoplasmic location in interphase. These results show that co-localization of annexin 11 and S100A6 at the nuclear envelope may be regulated either by elevation of intracellular Ca2+ or by cell cycle progression and provide the first evidence that these proteins may associate in vivo.

The vertebrate annexins constitute a family of 12 distinct genes that encode proteins with the shared ability to bind calcium dependently to negatively charged phospholipids (for reviews see Refs. 1Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar and 2Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). Despite their considerable structural similarity and overlapping biophysical characteristics, research in recent years indicates that individual annexins have distinct physiological roles. Thus, although annexin function is still not understood at the mechanistic level, targeted gene disruption experiments in mice and chick DT40 cells have revealed a range of phenotypes that are generally unaccompanied by compensatory changes in expression of other annexins. These phenotypes point to roles for annexins in diverse biological processes, including vesicle trafficking (3Emans N. Gorvel J.P. Walter C. Gerke V. Kellner R. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J.

Cell. 1997; 8: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For several annexins it is clear they do not act alone. Annexin 2 was first isolated as a component of a stable heterotetrameric complex with S100A10 (formerly p11) (9Glenney Jr., J.R. Boudreau M. Galyean R. Hunter T. Tack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10485-10488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S100 proteins form a branch of the EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins exemplified by calmodulin and constitute a second family of calcium-binding proteins of poorly understood functions (10Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The (annexin 2·S100A10)2 complex is unusual in being calcium-independent. This is because the two EF-hands of S100A10 contain amino acid changes that render the canonical helix-loop-helix incapable of binding calcium ions while driving structural changes that effectively lock S100A10 into a form that mimics a hypothetical Ca2+-bound structure (11Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Although the complex is stable in the absence of Ca2+, the two annexin 2 monomers within the complex retain Ca2+ sensitivity, rendering the quaternary protein complex potentially sensitive to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Interactions between annexins and S100 proteins are now known to extend to other members of these protein families. Annexin 1 binds to S100A11 (formerly S100C) (12Mailliard W.S. Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Rety S. Osterloh D. Arie J.P. Tabaries S. Seeman J. Russo-Marie F. Gerke V. Lewit-Bentley A. Structure. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and annexin 11 binds to S100A6 (formerly calcyclin) (14Tokumitsu H. Mizutani A. Hidaka H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast to the annexin 2·S100A10 complex, interactions between annexins 1 and 11 and their respective S100 ligands are absolutely dependent on Ca2+. For this reason, it has so far proven impossible to isolate the Ca2+-dependent annexin·S100 complexes from cell or tissue extracts. The discovery that annexin 11 binds to S100A6 was the result of affinity chromatography using immobilized S100A6 (15Minami H. Tokumitsu H. Mizutani A. Watanabe Y. Watanabe M. Hidaka H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A reverse strategy, in which the immobilized N terminus of annexin 1 was used as bait in A431 cell extracts, led to the discovery of S100A11 as a cognate binding partner (12Mailliard W.S. Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 719-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Given the specificity of the annexin 1-S100A11 and annexin 11-S100A6 interactions and the relatively low Ca2+ requirement for their formation, it is reasonable to expect that under certain circumstances these complexes may exist in living cells. Indeed, mutation of the binding site for annexin 1 on S100A11 results in failure of S100A11 to be recruited to transferrin receptor-positive endosomes, indicating that this interaction does indeed occur in vivo (16Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite several studies on the interaction between annexin 11 and S100A6, including identification of the binding site to residues 49-62 in the long N-terminal domain (17Sudo T. Hidaka H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the mutual exclusion of the two proteins from a single subcellular compartment raises the possibility that the annexin 11·S100A6 complex may exist only in vitro. Because annexin 11 and S100A6 are both Ca2+-binding proteins and because S100A6 protein levels oscillate in a cell cycle-dependent manner (18Kindy M.S. Brown K.E. Sonenshein G.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 46: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we therefore examined whether Ca2+ fluxes and/or cell cycle progression might regulate the co-localization of annexin 11 and S100A6. We show here that, whereas S100A6 is relatively sedentary in the nuclear envelope, annexin 11 interacts dynamically with the nuclear envelope in both a Ca2+- and cell cycle-dependent manner. These results support the idea of a functional relationship between annexin 11 and S100A6.

For live cell microscopy, cells were grown in 35-mm glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek). Antibodies and Growth Factors—Primary antibodies for immunofluorescence were L-19 goat polyclonal anti-human annexin 11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-pig S100A6 (Sigma), M-20 goat polyclonal anti-mouse lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse monoclonal anti-rat lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) (Transduction Laboratories). Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-goat-Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes), donkey anti-mouse-Cy5, and donkey anti-mouse-TRITC (gift from Dr. C. Futter, Institute of Opthalmology, University College London, UK). Antibodies for Western blotting were affinity-purified sheep polyclonal anti-chicken annexin 11 (raised against recombinant chicken annexin 11 protein) and 4G10 mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology). Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a gift from Dr. A. Limb (University College London, UK), was used at 40 ng/ml, and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), a gift from Dr. M. Bailly (University College London, UK), was used at 50 ng/ml. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were washed in PBS, fixed/permeabilized on ice for 30 min in 2% paraformaldehyde + 0.1% Triton X-100, washed four times in PBS and blocked for 15 min with 1% BSA (Sigma). Fixed cells were then incubated in a moist chamber with primary antibody in 1% BSA for 1 h, followed by four washes of 5-10 min each in PBS before incubation with the secondary antibody in 1% BSA for another hour. After four more washes in PBS, samples were observed under a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 AGR 3 (Q) confocal attached to a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV inverted microscope using a ×100 oil immersion lens. Images were acquired with LaserSharp 2000 (Bio-Rad) and processed using Metamorph 4.6r9 (Universal Imaging). Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—A431 cell monolayers were washed in PBS, solubilized in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, 0.02% sodium azide) supplemented with 10 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) per 107 cells and lysed by three rounds of sonication on ice. Lysates were precleared at 16,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 30 μl of 50% Protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, and then 5 min of centrifugation at 16,000 g at 4 °C. L-19 goat anti-human annexin 11 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was immobilized on Protein G-Sepharose beads and added to the precleared lysates for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged, and the supernatant discarded. Beads were washed four times in lysis buffer minus BSA and once in ice-cold PBS. After removal of the supernatant, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on discontinuous mini-gels. Proteins were electroblotted for 45 min at 400 mA onto Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were treated with blocking solution (10% skimmed milk or 10% BSA in PBS-Tween (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20)) for 40 min at room temperature and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with primary antibody in PBS-Tween. Following three PBS-Tween washes, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody for 90 min, also in PBS-Tween (1/10,000 dilution). IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were used as secondary antibodies. Blots were developed after three more PBS-Tween washes using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized in a Fujifilm Intelligent Dark Box II coupled to a LAS-1000 charge coupled device-camera. Generation of Annexin 11·Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Fusion Constructs—Full-length human annexin 11 coding sequence, annexin 11 N-terminal domain (nucleotides 1-642 in the annexin 11 coding sequence), and annexin 11 C-terminal core domain (nucleotides 624-1515 in the annexin 11 coding sequence) were amplified by RT-PCR from A431 cDNA and cloned in-frame into pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) for fusion at the C-terminal end of GFP or into pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech) for fusion at the N-terminal end of GFP. Transient Transfection and Live Cell Imaging—Cells were transfected with the different annexin 11·GFP fusion constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions and incubated for 24 h to allow gene expression before placing them in a 37 °C preheated microscope chamber with 5% CO2 supply. Cells were observed before and after stimulation under a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 AGR-3 (Q) confocal attached to a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV inverted microscope using a ×100 oil immersion lens. Images were acquired with LaserSharp 2000 (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using Metamorph 4.6r9 (Universal Imaging). Cell Synchronization—Cells were grown to 50% confluence and incubated overnight in medium containing 4 mm thymidine (Sigma) to achieve S phase block. Dishes were extensively washed in PBS and cultured for a further 6 h in medium containing 0.07 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for growth arrest at the onset of mitosis. Cells were then extensively washed and allowed to recover in normal medium for 5-60 min before immunofluorescence analysis. We first examined the subcellular localization of annexin 11 and S100A6 in fixed A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. Annexin 11 was predominantly nuclear, though excluded from the nucleoli, and was also apparent in punctate form in the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). In contrast, S100A6 displayed a strong signal in the region of the nuclear envelope, together with discrete inner nuclear structures and punctate cytoplasmic staining that did not coincide with annexin 11. Thus, in unstimulated A431 cells, S100A6 and annexin 11 appear to occupy non-overlapping subcellular compartments. Similar results were obtained in HeLa and HEp2 cells (data not shown). To confirm that the S100A6-positive ring-like structure at the nuclear periphery is the nuclear envelope, A431 cells were co-stained for lamin B, a well characterized resident of the inner nuclear membrane (Fig. 1B). The results show that S100A6 is indeed strongly enriched at the nuclear envelope and also co-localizes with lamin B at focal points within the nucleus. The constitutive association of S100A6 with the nuclear envelope in A431 cells contrasts with previous studies in vascular smooth muscle cells in which this interaction was reported to be Ca2+-dependent (19Stradal T.B. Gimona M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31593-31596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To investigate the Ca2+ sensitivity of S100A6 and annexin 11 in our experimental model, A431 cells were exposed to ionomycin for 30 min prior to fixation and immunostaining (Fig. 2A). Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ caused the relocalization of annexin 11 to the nuclear envelope but had little effect on either S100A6 or the punctate cytoplasmic pool of annexin 11. Because annexin 11 has been reported to be a substrate for cellular protein kinases, including the calcium-activated tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (20Mizutani A. Tokumitsu H. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15517-15522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Furge L.L. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33504-33509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we also examined whether the response to ionomycin was accompanied by protein phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Immunoprecipitation of annexin 11 from ionomycin-treated cells, followed by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, revealed that annexin 11 is indeed phosphorylated on tyrosine under these conditions. In contrast, neither staurosporine nor EGF treatment led to tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin 11, nor did either stimulus drive the association of annexin 11 to the nuclear envelope (not shown). Because the lysis conditions used in these immunoprecipitation experiments favored a whole cell extraction, we next investigated the ionomycin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin 11 in cytosolic and nuclear extracts prepared in the absence and presence of 200 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 2C). These experiments demonstrate that preservation of tyrosine phosphorylation in lysates of ionomycin-treated A431 cells requires the presence of Ca2+ in the lysis buffer. Interestingly, separation of the nuclear and cytosolic pools led to the apparent partial degradation of tyrosine-phosphorylated annexin 11 in both fractions to polypeptide species of 30 and 40 kDa, respectively. However, reprobing the blot with antisera to annexin 11 shows that the majority of the protein remains in the 55-kDa form, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin 11 may increase its susceptibility to proteolysis. Because studies elsewhere have shown that annexin 11 can also be tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated VSMCs (21Furge L.L. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33504-33509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the results obtained in A431 cells would be paralleled in VSMCs. In these experiments we performed live cell-image analysis to track the localization of an ectopically expressed annexin 11·GFP fusion protein in primary cultures of porcine VSMCs. A series of confocal images were obtained every 5 s for 3 min following exposure to ionomycin and clearly showed that annexin 11·GFP becomes tightly localized to the nuclear envelope as well as to both plasma membrane and dispersed intracellular structures within a few seconds of ionophore treatment (Fig. 3A). Treatment of VSMCs with PDGF-BB had no effect on the nuclear annexin 11·GFP but led to a concentration of cytoplasmic annexin 11·GFP partly to the plasma membrane and also to intracellular structures (Fig. 3B). The contrasting effects of ionophore and growth factor in VSMCs closely match the results obtained in A431 cells. Consistent with these findings, we observed a negligible effect of PDGF-BB on tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin 11 in stimulated VSMCs (Fig. 3C), whereas annexin 11 was clearly tyrosine-phosphorylated in ionomycin-treated cells. Next, we investigated the structural basis for the annexin 11 response to ionomycin (Fig. 4). Two constructs were generated in which the full-length annexin 11 coding sequence was fused to GFP, one with GFP at the C terminus of annexin 11 (anx11·GFP) and the other with GFP at the N terminus (GFP·anx11). Two additional expression plasmids were constructed, one in which the four-repeat Ca2+-binding C terminus of annexin 11 was replaced with GFP (N-ter·GFP) and a second in which GFP replaced the long proline-, tyrosine- and glycine-rich N terminus (GFP·C-ter). Transient transfection of these constructs in A431 cells revealed that anx11·GFP and GFP·anx11 were expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of living cells, with anx11·GFP tending to exhibit a greater enrichment in the nucleus. N-ter·GFP expression was markedly stronger in the nucleus than the cytoplasm, whereas GFP·C-ter was completely excluded from the nucleus. This is in agreement with previous observations that showed the N-terminal domain of annexin 11 is both necessary and sufficient for the nuclear localization of annexin 11 (22Mizutani A. Watanabe N. Kitao T. Tokumitsu H. Hidaka H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We then compared the responses of these expression constructs to ionomycin treatment in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. Both anx11·GFP and GFP·anx11 displayed almost complete relocalization from the nucleus to the nuclear envelope, together with a change from diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence to punctate cytoplasmic or plasma membrane-associated fluorescence. Similar results were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+, indicating that mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores alone is sufficient to elicit these responses. In contrast, N-ter·GFP completely failed to respond to ionomycin, and although GFP·C-ter exhibited sensitivity to Ca2+ by relocating to intracellular membranes, there was no evidence of preferential translocation to the nuclear envelope. These results demonstrate that whereas the C-terminal core domain of annexin 11 is essential to confer Ca2+ sensitivity, the N-terminal domain determines the specificity for the nuclear envelope in the Ca2+-dependent relocalization of annexin 11. Furthermore, the images obtained using anx11·GFP and GFP·anx11 demonstrate that GFP may be fused to either end of the annexin 11 molecule without interfering with normal responses to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Although these results reveal a potential mechanism whereby the annexin 11-S100A6 interaction might be regulated, we were interested to explore the possibility of a cell cycle-dependent interaction. In A431 cells at early prophase we obtained evidence in support of this idea (Fig. 5A). At this point in the cell cycle the nuclear pool of annexin 11 apparently relocates, at least in part, to the nuclear envelope. The annexin 11 remaining in the nucleus becomes distinct from the condensed DNA content, which contrasts with the picture obtained for interphase cells (Fig. 1A). We also observed, in cells further into prophase, that annexin 11 becomes associated with invaginations or folds in the nuclear envelope where it co-localizes with S100A6. The pattern of immunostaining for annexin 11 and S100A6 in these late prophase cells is similar to that reported for other nuclear envelope proteins, in particular LAP2 (23Holmer L. Worman H.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1741-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We therefore co-stained late prophase cells for annexin 11 and LAP2 (Fig. 5B), which enabled us to confirm that annexin 11 is indeed associated with microtubule-induced folds that serve an initiating role in nuclear envelope breakdown (24Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). S100A6 immunostaining was virtually undetectable in A431 cells from metaphase to telophase (not shown), indicating that S100A6 protein levels drop during mitosis. This observation is in agreement with previous studies that showed the level of expression of S100A6 is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, peaking in the transition from G0- to S-phase in smooth muscle cells (18Kindy M.S. Brown K.E. Sonenshein G.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 46: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We therefore immunostained A431 cells in telophase for annexin 11 and LAP2 (Fig. 5C). In late telophase, annexin 11 and LAP2 again co-localize, this time in the reforming nuclear envelope. However, while LAP2 remains clearly associated with the nuclear envelope as cells progress into early interphase, annexin 11 becomes concentrated within the nucleus. These observations show that annexin 11 displays a dynamic and biphasic interaction with the nuclear envelope, first during nuclear envelope breakdown and again during reassembly of the nuclear envelope. Annexin 11 is unusual within the annexin family in being a predominantly nuclear protein. This is in contrast to its most extensively characterized in vitro ligand, S100A6, which is shown here and in other studies (19Stradal T.B. Gimona M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31593-31596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to be localized to the nuclear envelope. Because the annexin literature contains several unverified reports of interactions between annexins and putative intracellular ligands, it is important to establish which, if any, of these occur in vivo because such interactions are likely to have functional consequences. A more recently identified ligand of annexin 11, namely the penta-EF-hand protein ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene 2) (25Satoh H. Shibata H. Nakano Y. Kitaura Y. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is expressed in the nucleus (26Kitaura Y. Matsumoto S. Satoh H. Hitomi K. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14053-14058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), though ALG-2 also binds annexin 7, peflin, and AIP1/Alix (25Satoh H. Shibata H. Nakano Y. Kitaura Y. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Satoh H. Nakano Y. Shibata H. Maki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The binding site for ALG-2 on annexins 7 and 11 is located in the long PYG domain at the N terminus of each annexin, a domain that is also present in AIP1/Alix. Because the binding sites for ALG-2 and S100A6 on annexin 11 are therefore both located in the N terminus, these observations raise the possibility that, depending on subcellular localization and the availability of free Ca2+, S100A6 and ALG-2 may compete for and differentially modulate the properties of annexin 11. However, prior to consideration of these hypothetical possibilities it is necessary to establish a prerequisite for the annexin 11-S100A6 interaction, namely that the two proteins occupy a single subcellular compartment. We show here that whereas annexin 11 and S100A6 are unlikely to interact in vivo in interphase cells under resting conditions, they are both present at the nuclear envelope upon elevation of intracellular calcium. Interestingly, despite the fact that annexin 11 and S100A6 are both Ca2+-binding proteins, annexin 11 alone manifested its Ca2+ sensitivity as a change in localization. Moreover, the N-terminal domain of annexin 11, known to contain the S100A6-binding site, was necessary for the relocalization of annexin 11 to the nuclear envelope in ionomycin-treated A431 cells, reinforcing the idea that the association of annexin 11 with the nuclear envelope in the presence of calcium may occur via a direct interaction with S100A6. The finding that ionomycin treatment leads not only to the relocalization of annexin 11 to the nuclear envelope but also to its tyrosine phosphorylation suggests that a Ca2+-activated tyrosine kinase may be involved in the specific association of annexin 11 with the nuclear envelope. Thus, in two distinct cell types we have shown that ionophore-mediated translocation of annexin 11 to the nuclear envelope is accompanied by annexin 11 tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas growth factor stimulation has no effect on either parameter. The failure of EGF and PDGF-BB to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin 11 is consistent with a previous report in which it was shown that stimulation of VSMCs with PDGF-BB induced tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin 11 only when added in conjunction with peroxovanadate (21Furge L.L. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33504-33509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these observations raise the question why EGF and PDGF fail to reproduce the responses observed with ionomycin, given that both growth factors also mobilize Ca2+. The most likely explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that the nucleus is ‘buffered’ from growth factor-mediated changes in cytosolic Ca2+ but not from the effects of ionophore (28al-Mohanna F.A. Caddy K.W. Bolsover S.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 29Badminton M.N. Kendall J.M. Rembold C.M. Campbell A.K. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The role of annexin 11 at the nuclear envelope during nuclear envelope breakdown and nuclear envelope reassembly is not known, but our findings illustrate a physiological situation in which annexin 11 and S100A6 might interact in vivo. The enrichment of annexin 11 at the nuclear envelope invaginations created by microtubules during nuclear envelope breakdown (24Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) is of particular interest because it could indicate a role for annexin 11 as a link between the nuclear envelope and the microtubules at these sites. Furthermore, several reports have established that calcium is required for nuclear envelope breakdown in eukaryotic cells (30Kao J.P. Alderton J.M. Tsien R.Y. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Wilding M. Wright E.M. Patel R. Ellis-Davies G. Whitaker M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and that spontaneous cell cycle-dependent Ca2+ transients are generated by pulsatile fluxes in inositol trisphosphate (32Ciapa B. Pesando D. Wilding M. Whitaker M. Nature. 1994; 368: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Calcium is also required for lamin B degradation (33Neamati N. Fernandez A. Wright S. Kiefer J. McConkey D.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3788-3795PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a role for Ca2+-binding proteins in these events. As a cell cycle-regulated nuclear Ca2+-binding protein, it is clearly possible that via its interaction with S100A6 annexin 11 has a role in membrane deconstruction during nuclear envelope breakdown. In contrast, the reappearance of annexin 11 during nuclear envelope reassembly may simply reflect passive transit of the protein to its notionally inactive nucleoplasmic location. If the putative annexin 11·S100A6 complex possesses such destructive activity, it would make sense that S100A6 protein levels are almost undetectable at the point in the cell cycle of nuclear envelope reassembly, thereby eliminating any possible and untimely deconstructive activity of the annexin 11·S100A6 complex. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and cell cycle-dependent events are independently capable of driving the translocation of annexin 11 from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear envelope. Our observations support the idea that annexin 11 and S100A6 interact in vivo and provide evidence for a role for annexin 11 in the regulation of nuclear envelope dynamics.

Indeed, recent evidence suggests that decorin plays an important role in suppressing tumor growth by two independent mechanisms (6Santra M. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

J. 1987; 248: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) amino acids, to which are attached a single glycosaminoglycan chain of dermatan or chondroitin sulfate (at Ser-4, Ref. 11Chopra R.K. Pearson C.H. Pringle G.A. Fackre D.S. Scott P.G. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and three N-linked oligosaccharides (12Scott P.G. Dodd C.M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1990; 24: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In chicken there is a form of decorin that carries two glycosaminoglycan chains (13Blaschke U.K. Hedbom E. Bruckner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30347-30353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of decorin includes a series of at least 10 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs),1 averaging 24 residues in length (14Patthy L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Decorin is a member of the family of extracellular matrix small leucine-rich repeat glycoproteins/proteoglycans (15Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) but the LRR motif is more widely distributed and has been found in many intracellular, cell surface, and extracellular proteins (16Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). There have been a number of studies of the interactions of decorin with other extracellular proteins, with cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β (3Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) and with cell-surface receptors (4Iozzo R.V. Moscatello D.K. McQuillan D.J. Eichstetter I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35153-35161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the physical properties of this small proteoglycan, which are important for the proper interpretation and understanding of these interactions, have not been well characterized. Early light scattering studies on decorin (then called proteodermatan sulfate) extracted from pig skin suggested a very high particle mass in solution: 3.4 × 103 kDa (17Coster L. Fransson L.A. Sheehan J. Nieduszynski I.A. Phelps C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 197: 483-490Google Scholar). A later study of material extracted from cow skin, as described here, gave molecular masses for the intact proteoglycan and the glycoprotein core produced by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase in 0.15 m NaCl of 610 and 650 kDa, respectively (18Zangrando D.W. Gupta R. Jamieson A.M. Blackwell J. Scott P.G. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In 4 m GdnHCl the molecular masses reduced to 62 and 39 kDa; values much closer to those estimated from the mobility in SDS-PAGE or calculated from the amino acid composition (36,333 Da) plus the single dermatan sulfate chain (∼24 kDa, Ref. 18Zangrando D.W. Gupta R. Jamieson A.M. Blackwell J. Scott P.G. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and the three N-linked oligosaccharides (∼6 kDa). 2P. G. Scott, unpublished data. The anomalously high molecular weights measured in solution were attributed to self-association that has also been reported to be a property of dermatan sulfate chains in NaCl (19Fransson L.A. Nieduszynski I.A. Phelps C.F. Sheehan J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 586: 179-188Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the exponential dependence of light scattering intensity on particle size can lead to erroneous results for samples containing small proportions of aggregated material incompletely removed during sample preparation or formed in situ. The investigation described here avoided this pitfall by using continuous monitoring of the refractive index and light scattering intensity of the effluent from gel chromatography columns. The contribution of any aggregate present in the solution is then readily detected and can be corrected for, or, if necessary, it can be eliminated by re-chromatography. Previous studies have shown that some samples of decorin extracted from tissues with chaotropes do not regain native structure and activity once the denaturant has been removed (15Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). There have also been reports that some preparations of tissue-derived decorin have lower activity in functional assays than recombinant decorin (20Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegard D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Therefore, here we used both extracted decorin and recombinant prodecorin purified entirely without chaotropes. The results clearly establish that both forms of decorin are dimers in solution, over a wide concentration range. Furthermore, the solution x-ray scattering profile gives insight into the shape of this protein dimer. Bovine skin decorin was extracted from the hide of a young steer of between 18 months and 2 years of age into deionized 7m urea, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris, adjusted to pH 6.5 with HCl and containing sodium azide (0.02%, w/v) and proteinase inhibitors (10 mm disodium EDTA, 0.1m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mmphenylmethane sulfonic acid, 5 mg/liter pepstatin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin). It was purified by a combination of anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, precipitation with 75% ethanol, and cetylpyridinium chloride and gel-filtration chromatography (21Pearson C.H. Winterbottom N. Fackre D.S. Scott P.G. Carpenter M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15101-15104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant bovine prodecorin was isolated from the medium of 293A cells infected with an adenovirus engineered to express full-length bovine decorin. The Adeno-Quest™ kit (Quantum Biotechnologies Inc., Laval, Quebec, Canada), comprising a transfer vector (pQBI-AdBM5),ClaI-digested DNA from adenovirus type 5 with E1 and E3 deletions, and associated reagents, was used. The cDNA encoding the full protein sequence of bovine decorin was kindly provided by Dr. Larry Fisher of the Bone Research Branch, NIDR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, as an EcoR1 insert in the plasmid PG-28 (10Day A.A. McQuillan C.I. Termine J.D. Young M.R. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For large-scale production of recombinant decorin, host 293A cells were grown to confluence in “triple flasks” of 500-cm2 growth area (Nalge Nunc International), 6 × 107 cells per flask, in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The medium was changed to DMEM, 5% FBS (90 ml/flask) and 4 × 109 PFU of decorin adenovirus were added to each flask, which was then incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Cells and medium were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant collected from 8 triple flasks (about 700 ml) was thawed and applied to a 2.6 × 10-cm column of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.2m NaCl, buffered at pH 7.2 with sodium phosphate (buffer A) at 4 °C. The column was washed with 5 volumes of buffer A, and bound material was then eluted with a linear gradient of 150 ml each of buffer A and buffer B (buffer A with 1.0 m NaCl). Fractions containing decorin, as detected by the dimethylmethylene blue assay for glycosaminoglycans (22Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), were pooled, diluted with water to reduce the concentration of NaCl to below 0.1 m, and reapplied to the same DEAE-Sephacel column, which had been washed extensively with buffer A. Elution of bound proteoglycan, which emerged as a single broad peak at about 0.5 m NaCl, was repeated as above. After extensive dialysis against water, the partially purified decorin (yield 20 mg) was freeze-dried. Portions (10 mg) of this material were dissolved in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris/HCl, 0.5 mNaCl, pH 7.2 (buffer C) and applied to a 1 × 5-cm column of concanavalinA-Sepharose (Sigma Chemical Co.), equilibrated in buffer C at 4 °C. After washing to remove any unbound material, as detected by monitoring the absorbance at 230 nm, bound proteoglycan was eluted as a single peak with a linear gradient of 15 ml each of buffer C and the same buffer containing 0.5 m α-methylmannoside. Fractions containing glycosaminoglycan were pooled, dialyzed exhaustively against water, and freeze-dried. The yield of purified recombinant decorin was about 14 mg from each batch of 700 ml of conditioned medium. This material was stored dessicated at −80 °C. Decorin core protein was prepared by digesting intact proteoglycan with chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4, Seikagaku) at a ratio of 1 unit of enzyme per 6 mg of proteoglycan in 0.1 m Tris adjusted to pH 7.3 with acetic acid and containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. The digest was then applied to a 0.8 × 5-cm column of concanavalin A-Sepharose equilibrated in 0.05 m sodium phosphate, 0.5m NaCl, pH 7.0 at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. After washing with about 8 column volumes of this buffer, bound proteoglycan core was eluted as a single peak with the same buffer containing 0.3m α-methyl-d-mannoside (Sigma). Fractions containing protein, as monitored by absorption at 280 nm, were pooled and desalted by three successive rounds of 10-fold concentration and dilution with water in a centrifugal concentrator (Millipore UltrafreeR, nominal molecular mass cutoff 10 kDa) at 1900 × g. This material was stored at 4 °C. Protein contents were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (23Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk DC. Analyt. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycan contents were determined by the dimethylmethylene blue dye-binding assay using pig skin dermatan sulfate (Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) as a standard (22Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The purified proteoglycans and the protein cores produced from them by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase or by chondroitin ABC lyase followed by N-glycosidase F (EC 3.2.2.18, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described (12Scott P.G. Dodd C.M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1990; 24: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were examined by gel electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1 m Tris, 0.1m sodium borate, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.6 (24Mechanic G. Simmons D.J. Kumin A.S. Skeletal Research: An Experimental Approach. Academic Press, New York1979: 227-241Google Scholar). The reactivity of the recombinant decorin with four monoclonal antibodies (7B1, 3B3, 5D1, and 6D6) prepared against natural bovine decorin was tested by Western blotting, as described (25Scott P.G. Dodd C.M. Pringle G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11558-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the first 27 amino acid residues of the recombinant decorin was determined in a Biolynx amino acid sequencer on a sample of the core protein produced by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase, purified by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (26Scott P.G. Nakano T. Dodd C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter on samples of proteoglycan dissolved in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 at protein concentrations of about 0.1 mg/ml (determined by the BCA protein assay), in thermostatted cells of 1-mm pathlength. Samples of intact natural and recombinant decorins were dissolved at various concentrations (determined by the BCA protein assay, using bovine serum albumin as standard), in TBS (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, pH 7.0). After centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove particulate matter, samples of 0.25 or 0.5 ml were chromatographed on SuperoseTM 6 HR 10/30 and SuperoseTM 12 HR 10/30 columns (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS with or without 2.5m GdnHCl. The effluent from these columns was led through a DAWN-DSP laser light scattering photometer and Optilab 903 interferometer refractometer (Wyatt Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA). Light scattering data were processed by the Zimm method, using AstraTM for Windows software, version 4.10 (Wyatt Technologies). Values of dn/dc of 0.150 and 0.170, as determined previously (18Zangrando D.W. Gupta R. Jamieson A.M. Blackwell J. Scott P.G. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), were used for the intact skin decorin and the protein cores produced by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase. A value of 0.160 was assumed for the recombinant prodecorin based on its lower glycosaminoglycan content compared with that of skin decorin (see below). Satisfactory performance of the refractometer and light scattering detectors was checked by chromatography of samples of bovine serum albumin. X-ray scattering data were collected at station 2.1 (27Towns-Andrews E. Berry A. Bordas J. Mant P.K. Murray K. Roberts K. Sumner I. Worgan J.S. Lewis R. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1989; 60: 2346-2349Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) of the Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), Daresbury Laboratory. Solutions for the scattering experiments were prepared in TBS, pH 7.0, chromatographed on Superose-12 or Superose-6 columns to remove any aggregated material (see below), and then concentrated by ultrafiltration, as described above. Both full-length decorin and decorin core were measured at 4 °C, whereas the latter was also measured at 20 °C. The studies were performed in a standard cell at sample concentrations of 1 or 5 mg/ml, according to established procedures (28Grossmann J.G. Scharff A.J. O'Hare P. Luisi B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6267-6274Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This included the examination of the scattering data, which had been collected in individual time frames of 60 s, to ensure that no observable radiation damage, protein aggregation, or deposition on the cell windows, had occurred. After checking and averaging several runs, it was concluded that the samples were unaffected by the synchrotron X-rays and that the profiles obtained over a total data collection time of 90 min (120 min) for intact decorin (decorin core) were suitable for subsequent data analysis. A sample-to-detector distance of 1.25 m was used for both samples to cover the momentum transfer interval 0.03 Å−1 ≤ q ≤ 0.63 Å−1. In view of the large size of intact decorin, additional measurements at a distance of 4.25 m were performed, permitting q-values between 0.006 Å−1 and 0.18 Å−1. The latter provided a sufficiently large scattering range for merging profiles collected at short and long detector distances. The modulus of the momentum transfer is defined as q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength (1.54 Å). The q-range was calibrated using silver behenate powder and wet rat tail collagen (based on diffraction spacings of 58.38 and 670 Å, respectively). The radius of gyration, the forward scattering intensity, and the intraparticle distance distribution function p(r) were calculated from the experimental scattering data using the indirect Fourier transform method as implemented in the program GNOM (29Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Particle shapes were restored from the experimental scattering profiles using the ab initio procedure based on the simulated annealing algorithm to a set of dummy spheres representing the amino acid chain of the protein (30Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Since both intact decorin and decorin core exist as dimers in solution (see below), shape restorations were performed using a 2-fold symmetry axis. The program CRYSOL (31Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2778) Google Scholar) was used for the simulation of scattering curves from models based on the crystal structures of YopM, the leucine-rich effector protein fromYersinia pestis (PDB codes 1G9U and 1JL5). Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the purified natural and recombinant decorin samples by SDS-PAGE. The only differences that are apparent are the slightly higher electrophoretic mobility and more diffuse character of the band obtained with intact recombinant decorin (lane 4), compared with the natural material (lane 1). No differences were seen between the core proteins produced by digestion of the intact proteoglycans with chondroitin ABC lyase (lanes 2 and 5). Therefore the higher mobility of the recombinant decorin is a result of its having a shorter dermatan sulfate chain. This was confirmed by the lower content of dermatan sulfate measured colorimetrically (27% compared with 35%). The more diffuse appearance of this band indicates that the glycosaminoglycan chain on the recombinant decorin is also more variable in length. The indistinguishable mobilities of the bands seen after further digestion of the chondroitin ABC lyase core proteins with N-glycosidase F (lanes 3 and 6), demonstrate that both materials are substituted withN-linked oligosaccharides to the same extent. The recombinant and natural decorins are both recognized on Western blots by four monoclonal antibodies (7B1, 3B3, 5D1, and 6D6) raised against bovine skin decorin (25Scott P.G. Dodd C.M. Pringle G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11558-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Decorin from cow skin has been sequenced in its entirety in our laboratory by Edman degradation (9Scott P.G. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate and Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans: Chemistry, Biology, Chemical Pathology. Portland Press, London1993: 81-101Google Scholar). The sequence of the first 27 amino acids of the recombinant decorin was determined in the present study by Edman degradation on a sample of the protein core produced by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase. The major sequence (accounting for about 75% of the yield of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatized amino acid at early cycles) was GPFQQKGLFDFMLEDEA-GIGPEEHFP. This is the sequence of the pro-form of bovine decorin. A second, minor, sequence (DEA-GI-PE), corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of mature bovine decorin, was apparent at cycles 1 to 9. We therefore conclude that proteolytic processing of the recombinant protein by the host 293A cells was inefficient and that this product is predominantly in the pro-form. The gap in the sequence at cycle 18 (or 4) corresponds to the serine residue that is substituted with the single dermatan sulfate chain in bovine decorin (11Chopra R.K. Pearson C.H. Pringle G.A. Fackre D.S. Scott P.G. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows circular dichroism spectra recorded for intact natural decorin and recombinant prodecorin samples in 0.025 m sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. Three features (Cotton effects) are apparent: a negative at 217 nm, a weak positive at 204 nm, and a second (weaker) negative at 196 nm. The spectra for natural and recombinant decorin are very similar and are characteristic of secondary structures dominated by β-sheet and β-turn, with little if any α-helix. We have previously published an interpretation of an almost identical spectrum that had been obtained for the protein core of a different sample of natural decorin prepared as described here, namely 2% α-helix, 43% β-sheet, and 14% β-turn (32Scott P.G. Winterbottom N. Dodd C.M. Edwards E. Pearson C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Communs. 1986; 138: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra recorded in the presence of 2.25 m GdnHCl (Fig. 2) show essentially complete abolition of the negative Cotton effect near 217 nm. Removal of GdnHCl by dialysis resulted in complete recovery of the original secondary structure, as previously reported by us for urea (32Scott P.G. Winterbottom N. Dodd C.M. Edwards E. Pearson C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Communs. 1986; 138: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the results of chromatography on Superose-12 of a sample of bovine skin decorin dissolved in TBS. The refractive index signal shows a major peak, accounting for more than 90% of the total mass of recovered material, with a small shoulder on the leading edge accounting for about 7%. The 90° light scattering detector shows three peaks: one at V0 not corresponding to any detectable refractive index signal and therefore presumably caused by a small amount of fine particulate material, which was not removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, a second associated with the shoulder on the leading edge of the main peak, and a third, corresponding to the main refractive index peak. Results for recombinant prodecorin were identical (data not shown). Light scattering by the small amount of material associated with the shoulder, which was always present in freshly dissolved samples of intact natural decorin or recombinant prodecorin, is strong and interferes with the estimation of the molecular weight of the material in the major peak. Therefore fractions corresponding to the major peak, pooled as indicated, were re-chromatographed on the same column at least once (Fig.3B), prior to the calculation of molecular weights. Duplicate analyses gave molecular masses for natural and recombinant decorin of 165 ± 1 kDa (average and range) and 148 ± 18 kDa, respectively. The effects of concentration on chromatography and mass were investigated by re-running material from the main peak on the same column. No decrease in average mass was seen for intact decorin samples at peak concentrations of between 2.53 μm and 59.5 nm. Chromatographic behavior, as assessed by monitoring the refractive index, was unchanged even at 2.7 nm, although values for mass could not be estimated reliably at such low protein concentrations. The dimer is therefore stable at very high dilutions and does not have a measurable dissociation constant under the conditions used here. Fig. 4A shows gel chromatography profiles and plots of molecular weight against elution volume for intact decorin and the protein core in the presence and absence of 2.5 m GdnHCl. Denaturation of intact decorin by GdnHCl caused a slight increase in elution volume but an ∼2-fold decrease in mass (to 88.3 ± 2.8 kDa). The native core protein gave only a single peak of mass 84.6 ± 4 kDa when chromatographed in TBS but in 2.5 m GdnHCl it eluted earlier, with a 2-fold reduction in mass (to 48.2 ± 3.6 kDa). This value is in reasonable agreement with the molecular mass of 42.3 kDa that can be calculated for the decorin monomer from its composition (36.3 kDa for the protein and 6 kDa for the N-linked oligosaccharides). Fig. 4B compares the chromatographic behavior and mass of samples dissolved in TBS containing 2.5m GdnHCl and then chromatographed in TBS alone, with those dissolved directly in TBS. Material under the peaks obtained in the first case gave mass values of 112.8 kDa (for intact decorin) and 68.9 kDa (for the protein core). These values are intermediate between those determined above for the denatured monomers (in 2.5 mGdnHCl) and the native dimers (in TBS), indicating that they are mixtures of monomer and dimer. Core protein recovered from these columns gave CD spectra that were indistinguishable from those of the native protein shown in Fig. 2. Taken together, these results show that denatured monomeric decorin can reassemble into native dimers in solution rapidly when separated from chaotrope. Solution x-ray scattering profiles of intact natural decorin and decorin core and their distance distribution functions are shown in Fig. 5, A and B, respectively. The insets to the p(r) plots in Fig. 5B show the low angle regions in the form of Guinier plots (i.e. ln(I) versus q2), from which the radius of gyration (Rg) can be extracted from the slope (Rg2/3) of the straight line.

The sensor histidine kinase autophosphorylates upon receiving a signal and transfers the phosphoryl group to the response regulator, thereby activating it to initiate or repress transcription of appropriate target response genes (1Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). In the NtrC family of response regulators, the phosphorylated response regulator activates transcription from ς54 promoters by oligomerizing at an upstream enhancer-like element of DNA (2Porter S.C. North A.K. Wedel A.B. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2258-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 3Wyman C. Rombel I. North A.K. Bustamante C. Kustu S. Science. 1997; 275: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), interacting with ς54 holoenzyme via DNA looping (4Su W. Porter S.C. Kustu S. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5504-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and hydrolyzing ATP to initiate open complex formation (5Popham D.L. Szeto D. Keener J. Kustu S. Science. 1989; 24: 629-635Crossref Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Genes controlled by this subfamily of ς54 activators include those regulating nitrogen, pili synthesis, and development (6Merrick M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Several bacterial species with unique developmental stages have been shown to require two-component systems and minor ς factors for regulation of stage-specific gene expression. Bacillus subtilis sporulation is regulated by its cascade of ς factors and two-component regulatory systems (7Kroos L. Zhang B. Ichikawa H. Yu Y.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Likewise, bothCaulobacter crescentus (8Marques M.V. Gomes S.L. Gober J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5502-5510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Myxococcus xanthus(9McCleary W.R. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6661-6668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) specifically require activation of transcription by two-component systems and ς54 holoenzyme for differentiation processes in response to cell cycle signals and fruiting body formation, respectively. In fact, most bacterial species possess two-component systems, with an apparent correlation between the number of systems and adaptability to changing environments. Chlamydiae are obligate, intracellular bacterial pathogens that adapt morphologically and metabolically according to two distinct environments, extracellular and intracellular. Their unique, biphasic developmental cycle consists of the infectious elementary body (EB)1 and the vegetative reticulate body (RB). The infectious EB are often described as “spore-like” because of their highly disulfide cross-linked outer membranes and lack of metabolic activity. Upon infecting the eukaryotic host cell and residing in a membrane-bound vesicle, called an inclusion, the EB differentiates into the metabolically active RB. The RB actively undergoes division by binary fission, but can only survive within the inclusion. After 18 h postinfection, RBs reorganize into EB within the growing inclusion, the host cell lyses, and EB are released to infect new cells. This developmental cycle appears to be tightly regulated so that dividing organisms may parasitize the host cell for energy and nutrients and yet be protected from the hostile extracellular environment. Because Chlamydia has optimized survival by adapting to two distinct environments, its development is likely controlled through recognition of environmental cues or intracellular conditions followed by subsequent regulation of gene expression. Due to the lack of a system for stable transformation ofChlamydia, little is known about transcriptional regulation of its developmental cycle. The genome sequence of C. trachomatis (11Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar) revealed several genes whose predicted protein products had sequence conservation to bacterial transcription factors. These included a pair of proteins with similarity to the histidine kinase response regulator pairs of two-component systems, as well as the sigma factor (ς54) it is predicted to activate. Interestingly, whereas many bacteria possess several two-component systems for adapting to various environmental changes, the NtrB/AtoS-NtrC/AtoC orthologs represent the only complete two-component system identified in the chlamydial genome. Because only one sensor kinase response regulator pair has been identified in the genome, we hypothesized that the chlamydial two-component system is functional and, together with ς54, mediates the transcriptional regulation of stages of its developmental cycle. Our results show that Chlamydia has a functional two-component system, capable of autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer reactions, and whose expression occurs during the transition from RB to EB. Now that function has been demonstrated, we have named these genes ctcB and ctcC forchlamydial two-component system. C. trachomatis serovar D was propagated in monolayers of HeLa 229 cells, and serovar L2 was propagated in L929 cells in spinner flasks. RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium (Invitrogen) was supplemented with 5–107 fetal bovine serum and 50 ॖg/ml vancomycin. Chlamydial EB were isolated by sonic treatments of cell suspensions and purified by ultracentrifugation over 30 and 30/447 renograffin gradients as described by Koehler et al. (12Koehler J.E. Burgess R.R. Thompson N.E. Stephens R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13206-13214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were frozen at −80 °C in sucrose-phosphate-glutamate buffer. The pET system (Novagen, Inc.) was the expression system used for overexpression of cloned CtcB and CtcC. ctcBfrom C. trachomatis serovar D was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers 5′-GAATTCGATGCCAAAAATCGACACTTG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGAGCGGGAGTCCATAG-3′, and ctcC was amplified using primers 5′-GAGCTCCATGTCGATAGAACACATTCTTATTATTGACGATGATCCC-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTAAGAGAGCGAGCATAGAAGGAGTGATCGC-3′ (Operon). The PCR products were cloned into TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The ctcBPCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and the ctcC PCR product was digested with SacI andXhoI. Each fragment was subcloned into pET21b expression vector. The CtcC-D54A mutant was prepared using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Primers selected were 5′-TCGATCTGATTATTTCCGCTATGAATATGCCTGATGGTTC-3′ and 5′-GAACCATCAGGCATTTCATAGCGGAAATAATCAGATCGA-3′. The pET21b constructs were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C in 100 ml of Luria broth with 100 ॖg/ml ampicillin. At OD600 of 0.6, cultures were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-औ-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Overexpressed recombinant CtcB and CtcC were found in insoluble inclusion bodies and purified under denaturing conditions. InducedE. coli were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 10 min and resuspended in 50 ml of wash buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.17 Triton X-100), sonicated briefly on ice, and centrifuged. The pellet was washed three times with wash buffer and dissolved in 5 ml of phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 1 h on ice. After a final centrifugation of 39,000 × gfor 20 min, supernatant containing denatured recombinant protein was loaded on a nickel resin column according to manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Inc.). Denatured protein was refolded by dialysis at 4 °C against refolding buffer (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 107 (v/v) glycerol) containing 6m urea (13Li Y. Plamann L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 289-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The buffer was exchanged for decreasing concentrations of urea (3, 2, 0.5, 0, 0 m) for at least 4 h per buffer exchange. Refolded protein was divided into 50-ॖl aliquots and stored at −20 °C. C. trachomatis serovar L2 was used to infect 8 × 105 cells/ml L929 cells at an multiplicity of infection of 1 in a 1-liter spinner flask. Total RNA was extracted from infected cells at 0, 4, 10, 24, and 48 h postinfection using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions, followed by DNase I treatment to remove contaminating DNA. Primer pairs were designed according to the predicted open reading frames from the C. trachomatis serovar D genome and used to amplify 400-bp regions within the ctcB and ctcCcoding sequences. euo and omcB were used as early and late expression controls, respectively. Primer pairs used were as follows: ctcB 5′-TCTCACGACTTCCTCTTCCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGGATCTATAGAGCGCTGT-3′ (reverse), ctcC5′-CCAGCGCTACAACAAGACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGCTTGCAAATGGATCGGA-3′ (reverse), euo 5′-GCAGCAAGAAGAGAATGCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCGCTCAGCTTCCTTCT-3′ (reverse), and omcB5′-TGCAACAGTATGCGCTTGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGACCAATCTGCTCCTGCA-3′ (reverse). cDNA synthesis was conducted using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 1 ॖg of RNA at 37 °C for 1 h. PCR reactions were conducted using Amplitaq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and consisted of 30 cycles of 95 °C denaturation, 52–55 °C annealing, and 72 °C extension. Controls with no RT were used for each PCR reaction, and chlamydial DNA controls were used for each primer pair. Purified C. trachomatis serovar D EB were pelleted and lysed with lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01m EDTA, 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, 0.17 SDS, 0.57 Triton X-100). Genomic DNA was digested with DNase I. Protein samples were resolved on 127 SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose. CtcB and CtcC were detected using mouse sera raised against recombinant proteins. Seminative gel electrophoresis was conducted according to Cullenet al. (14Cullen P.J. Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6530-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CtcC was separated on 107 polyacrylamide gels with SDS present only in the running buffer and not in the sample buffer or gel. Autophosphorylation assays were carried out with reaction volumes of 10 ॖl of 12 ॖmrecombinant CtcB in TEDG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, and 107 (v/v) glycerol) supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, FeCl2, CuCl2, or ZnSO4. CtcB was preincubated at 25 °C for 2 min before addition of 0.2 ॖm [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, final concentration, Amersham Biosciences) to the reaction mixture and allowed to incubate for indicated times. Reactions were stopped with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 47 SDS, 1.42 m औ-mercaptoethanol, 207 glycerol, and 10 ॖg of bromphenol blue) and loaded on a 107 SDS-PAGE gel, which was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager. Phophotransfer assays were conducted by allowing 6 ॖmCtcB to autophosphorylate for 30 min, followed by the addition of purified 6.65 ॖm CtcC in 20 ॖl of TEDG buffer, pH 6.5, with 5 mm MgCl2. Reactions were stopped at indicated times. Controls included a reaction mixture with CtcB∼P alone and a reaction mixture with CtcC and [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were separated on a 127 SDS-PAGE gel, which was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager. ctcB(CT467) is comprised of a 1059-bp sequence, predicted to encode a 352-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 39.9 kDa. A sequence similarity search in GenBankTM showed that CtcB was homologous to several histidine kinases, having the highest similarity scores with E. coli AtoS (15Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), M. xanthus PilS (16Wu S.S. Kaiser D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and NtrB of several bacterial species. However, the similarity scores against these sequences were relatively low (227 identity, 417 similarity toE. coli AtoS). Alignments of the sequences (Fig.1) showed that CtcB possesses most of the conserved motifs characteristically associated with histidine kinases. These motifs include blocks H (containing the His161autophosphorylation site), N, G2, and F (1Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Block G1, which comprises one of the glycine-rich, nucleotide-binding sites, is not conserved in CtcB. The CtcB sensor domain contains regions with homology to PAS domains (amino acids 28–96), which are sensors of overall energy levels of a cell (17Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CtcB does not possess an outer membrane leader sequence and is predicted to be cytosolic. ctcC (CT468) is comprised of a 1161-bp sequence, predicted to encode a 386-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 43.2 kDa. A sequence similarity search in GenBankTM showed good correlation with ς54 activator sequences. The highest similarity scores (407 identity, 627 similarity) were found withE. coli AtoC (18Flashner Y. Weiss D.S. Keener J. Kustu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 700-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PilR (19Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P.

Spencer D. Wong G.K. Wu Z. Paulsen I.T. Nature. 2000; 406: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar), and NtrC from several bacterial species. Alignment of the sequences (Fig. 2) revealed that CtcC has all of the conserved residues found to be necessary for function in other response regulators, including the Asp54phosphorylation site, and Asp10, Asp11, Lys104, and Thr82, which, together with Asp54, are predicted to constitute the active site in the receiver domain (amino acids 1–115) (20Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the ATPase domain (amino acids 161–305) has high sequence similarity to the AAA+ family of ATPases, characteristic of NtrC-related transcriptional regulators. This domain includes the Walker A box, which has an ATP-binding motif (GESGCGKE), and the predicted ς54 interaction site (GAFTGA) (21Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the CtcC sequence is lacking the C-terminal helix-turn-helix motif that is responsible for binding to DNA upstream of the ς54 promoter (22Contreras A. Drummond M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Morett E. Cannon W. Buck M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11469-11488Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). If functional, CtcC represents the only ς54 activator identified lacking the C-terminal DNA-binding domain. Because CtcB and CtcC sequence analysis revealed that they are unique in comparison to other two-component systems, we first determined whether the genes are transcribed and translated during the developmental cycle. To determine the expression pattern of chlamydial ctcB-ctcC, with respect to the developmental cycle, RT-PCR was used to detect transcripts ofctcB and ctcC at various time points postinfection (Fig. 3). Time points selected (0, 4, 10, 24, and 48 h postinfection) were representative of temporal classes of transcription during the chlamydial developmental cycle (24Shaw E.I. Dooley C.A. Fischer E.R. Scidmore M.A. Fields K.A. Hackstadt T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). euo (25Wichlan D.G. Hatch T.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2936-2942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andomcB (26Hatch T.P. Miceli M. Sublett J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 379-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) represented as early and late expression controls, respectively (data not shown). Both ctcB and ctcCtranscripts were first detected at 24 h postinfection (Fig.3), indicating late expression in the developmental cycle, correlating with RB to EB reorganization. To detect translated gene products in C. trachomatis, mouse antisera were raised against recombinant proteins (see below) and used to immunoblot lysates of purified EB (Fig.4). Antisera against CtcB recognized a distinct band of Mr ∼40,000, corresponding to the calculated mass of CtcB. Antisera against CtcC detected a distinct band at Mr 45,000, corresponding approximately to the calculated mass of CtcC. Neither protein was detected in chlamydial RB (data not shown). The presence of CtcB and CtcC in EB lysates is consistent with the developmentally late expression profiles for each gene. Having established thatctcB and ctcC are transcribed and translated, we next characterized the function of the chlamydial two-component system by producing recombinant CtcB and CtcC for in vitrofunctional assays. Recombinant CtcB and CtcC were overexpressed inE. coli with His tags to facilitate purification. Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting of SDS-PAGE gels with E. coli lysates expressing CtcB or CtcC showed overexpressed bands atMr 44,000 and Mr 47,000, respectively (Fig. 5). These sizes corresponded approximately to the calculated masses of recombinant protein with His tags. However, both CtcB and CtcC were found in insoluble fractions of the lysates (data not shown). To obtain soluble proteins, purified inclusion bodies were denatured in 6 mguanidine hydrochloride and refolded in decreasing concentrations of urea. The refolded proteins maintained solubility and were used inin vitro functional assays. Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels showed a single distinct band for each purified protein (Fig. 5). Immunoblotting with antisera against CtcB detected only the full-length purified protein (Fig. 5A), and antisera against CtcC detected the full-length purified protein, as well as some smaller minor bands that probably represent degradation products (Fig.5B). Sequence analysis revealed thatctcC was missing the C-terminal DNA-binding domain that is found in ς54 activators of other organisms. Because DNA binding is believed to facilitate oligomerization of NtrC-like activators in proximity to ς54 (3Wyman C. Rombel I. North A.K. Bustamante C. Kustu S. Science. 1997; 275: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that if CtcC is functional it must be capable of oligomerization, despite the absent C-terminal domain. Therefore, purified CtcC was resolved on a seminative PAGE gel and detected it by immunoblot. Bands were detected at 51, 110, and 220 kDa, corresponding approximately to the expected sizes of CtcC monomers, dimers, and tetramers, respectively (Fig. 6). Two-component systems possess a unique phosphotransfer mechanism in which a sensor kinase autophosphorylates a histidine residue using ATP as a phosphodonor and then transfers the phosphate to an aspartate residue in the response regulator. CtcB has the conserved His161 that is autophosphorylated in histidine kinases, but is missing one of the glycine-rich motifs (G1) predicted to be responsible for nucleotide binding. Therefore, it was important to determine whether CtcB was capable of autophosphorylation using ATP as a phosphodonor. In vitro phosphorylation assays were conducted to determine CtcB autokinase activity. Because histidine kinases are known to have different divalent cation requirements for autophosphorylation, we varied the reaction conditions by adding Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, or Cu2+ to the reaction buffer (Fig.7A). CtcB became labeled in the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+, and, to a lesser degree, in the presence of Fe2+. To measure the temporal process of the reaction, the phosphorylation reaction was stopped at various time points after addition of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig.7B). CtcB became labeled after 2 min, and the autophosphorylation reaction continued for at least 2 h. If CtcB-CtcC comprise a functional two-component system, it should have both autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer activity. CtcB was shown to have autokinase activity and should, therefore, be capable of transferring the labeled phosphate to CtcC. Purified, recombinant CtcC was added to autophosphorylated CtcB, and samples were taken at various time points (Fig. 8A). Between 1 and 10 min, CtcB-32P lost its label, but only in the presence of CtcC. Autophosphorylation of CtcB continued in the absence of CtcC, indicating the necessity of CtcC for removing the label. Dephosphorylation of CtcB occurred more rapidly than the autophosphorylation reaction, indicating a high turnover of CtcC phosphorylation. To show specificity of phosphotransfer to CtcC, we generated a mutant whose predicted phosphorylation site was changed to an alanine (CtcC-D54A). Addition of CtcC-D54A to CtcB-32P did not cause a depletion of label in CtcB-32P, demonstrating that phosphotransfer is specific for CtcC containing the Asp54 phosphoacceptor (Fig. 8B). Sequence analysis of CtcB and CtcC revealed some important differences from other two-component systems. First, CtcB had relatively low sequence similarity to other histidine kinases and was missing the signature G1 motif in the ATP-binding cleft. Since other functional histidine kinases have been identified with missing block motifs (20Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the missing G1 motif in CtcB should not ablate its function as an autokinase, but likely alters the kinetics of the autophosphorylation reaction (1Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). The response regulator, CtcC, had highly conserved receiver and catalytic domains and should, therefore, be capable of catalyzing the phosphotransfer reaction from CtcB. CtcB and CtcC had autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer activity in vitro, but both reactions were weaker than those of enteric NtrB and NtrC (data not shown). The weaker activity could be attributed to several possibilities. First, because CtcB is missing part of its nucleotide-binding cleft, it likely binds the ATP phosphodonor less efficiently than orthodox histidine kinases. Second, while CtcB-P maintained stable phosphorylation for up to 2 h, CtcC-P appears to have a very short half-life, as has been described for some other response regulators (1Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Alternatively, because both recombinant proteins were refolded, the percentage of proteins folded to native conformation is unknown. However, when we purified soluble CtcB as a maltose-binding protein fusion protein, the autophosphorylation rate was limited as well (data not shown), suggesting that refolding was not a significant factor in reducing its activity. Because cytosolic conditions of Chlamydia are unknown, the in vitro conditions of the assays may not have been optimal for chlamydial proteins. That chlamydial CtcB-CtcC autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer reactions were weak was not surprising, given that Chlamydiaseems to acquire mildly deleterious mutations at a relatively high rate (27Stephens R.S. Wyrick P.B. Proceedings of the Tenth International Symposium on Human Chlamydial Infection. International Chlamydia Symposium, Antalya, Turkey2001: 3-12Google Scholar). As an obligate intracellular pathogen that does not encounter other organisms in its metabolically active form, Chlamydiaundergoes lower selective constraints and higher mutation rates that become fixed in the population, analogous to bacterial endosymbionts (28Moran N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 98: 2873-2878Crossref Scopus (772) Google Scholar). As a result, chlamydial proteins and enzymes tend to function less efficiently and have weaker catalytic activity than enzymes from free-living bacteria (29Koshiyama K.Y. Stephens R.S. Stamm W.E. Proceedings of the Ninth International Symposium on Human Chlamydial Infection. International Chlamydial Symposium, San Francisco1998: 535-538Google Scholar, 30Fehlner-Gardiner C. Rosnick C.

CtcC is the only ς54-activator homolog identified that lacks a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. NtrC of enteric bacteria dimerizes in solution, and higher ordered oligomerization is facilitated by phosphorylation and binding of DNA upstream of the promoter (3Wyman C. Rombel I. North A.K. Bustamante C. Kustu S. Science. 1997; 275: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). While the major dimerization determinant of enteric NtrC is found in the C-terminal domain (31Klose K.E. North A.K. Stedman K.M. Kustu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), truncation studies have shown that other ς54 activators, such as DctD and NifA ofRhizobium, do not require this domain for activation of ς54 (32Huala E. Ausubel F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3354-3365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Huala E. Stigter J. Ausubel F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1428-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since oligomerization of NtrC-like response regulators is essential for activation of ς54, we hypothesized that CtcC would be capable of aggregating in solution despite its missing DNA-binding domain. Our experiments confirmed that CtcC was able to dimerize and tetramerize in the absence of DNA. Therefore, CtcC likely activates transcription by oligomerizing in proximity to ς54 holoenzyme, thereby bypassing the DNA binding requirement. The ς54 holoenzyme mode of transcription requires long stretches of intergenic DNA for binding the transcriptional activator to sequences upstream of the promoter. TheChlamydiae are very distantly related to other eubacteria, based on rRNA sequences (34Pace N.R. Science. 1997; 276: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). That CtcB-CtcC had significant differences from other two-component systems has important evolutionary implications, especially in light of the fact that other pathogens, including Neisseria spp., have abandoned their requirement for ς54-regulated transcription, based on the presence of rpoN (ς54) pseudogenes and non-functional ς54 promoters (35Laskos L. Dillard J.P. Seifert H.S. Fyfe J.A. Davies J.K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ς54holoenzyme mode of transcription is advantageous to bacteria because it provides tight control of gene expression; activators of ς54 allow physiological or environmental conditions to govern whether genes are silent or highly expressed. However, a disadvantage is that this mode of transcription requires long stretches of intergenic DNA, thereby dictating an additional requirement for a larger chromosome. Therefore, the pressures that select for compact bacterial genomes may also select against ς54holoenzyme-mediated transcription (36Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The chlamydial genome is very small in comparison to other eubacteria (11Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar), and the missing DNA-binding domain of CtcC suggests that binding to an upstream enhancer-like element is not necessary for ς54activation. Therefore, without the requirement for DNA binding by CtcC for activation of ς54 holoenzyme, it is likely that selective pressures have enabled the development of a more compact genome for Chlamydia. In addition to showing that CtcB and CtcC comprise a functional two-component system, it was important to show thatChlamydia expressed these genes to rule out the possibility that they were pseudogenes. The chlamydial ctcB-ctcCtranscripts were detected at 24 h, about the time of transition from RB to EB. Consistent with the late gene expression profile, antisera raised against recombinant proteins detected CtcB and CtcC in EB lysates. While the RT-PCR data distinctly showed late transcription of these genes, it is unclear whether the presence of the CtcB in EB is functionally significant or results from residual undegraded proteins no longer necessary for transcriptional regulation. However, as many other two-component systems are expressed constitutively for efficient adaptation to changing environments, the late developmental expression of the chlamydial two-component system has implications for having a functional role in late developmental gene regulation. Therefore, CtcB and CtcC likely activate a subset of late genes or other transcription factors required for reorganization of RB to EB. Although, through genomic analysis, no obvious role has been assigned to the chlamydial two-component system, we speculate that it may be necessary for regulation of the unique developmental cycle ofChlamydia. ς54 promoters have been identified for two chlamydial genes of unknown function (38Studholme D.J. Buck M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Mathews S.A. Timms P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6239-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but DNA binding by ς54 has not been demonstrated. Sequence analysis showed that CtcB possesses a PAS domain, which is a known sensor of energy levels or redox state (17Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that both energy levels and redox state are important determinants in the chlamydial developmental cycle (40Kaul R. Wenman W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 41Hackstadt T. Todd W.J. Caldwell H.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 25-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Bavoil P. Ohlin A. Schachter J. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 479-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Entry of EB into host cells results in a reduction of disulfide-linked outer membrane proteins, resulting in increased membrane flexibility, relaxation of major outer membrane protein porin size, and increased uptake of essential nutrients. Likewise, upon decrease of available energy sources or reducing agents, RB development is hindered, resulting in a retardation of metabolic activity and oxidation of sulfhydryl groups of outer membrane proteins (43Ward M.E. Barron A.L. Microbiology of Chlamydia. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 71-95Google Scholar). As developmentally late-expressed proteins containing a redox sensing domain, the chlamydial two-component system likely has a role in late gene activation, perhaps in regulation of differentiation from RB to EB. We thank Dr. S. Kustu (University of California, Berkeley, CA) for her critical insight and helpful advice and Dr. E. Nicholson (University of California, Berkeley, CA) for his technical assistance in the CtcC-D54A mutant construction."

These tumors have a tendency to invade diffusely into the surrounding healthy brain tissue, thereby precluding their successful surgical removal. In this report, we examine the potential for the neuregulin-1/erbB receptor signaling network to contribute to this process by modulating glioma cell motility. Neuregulin-1 is expressed throughout the immature and adult central nervous system and has been demonstrated to influence the migration of a variety of cell types in the developing brain. In addition, erbB2, an integral member of the heterodimeric neuregulin-1 receptor, has been shown to be overexpressed in human glioma biopsies. Using antibodies specific for erbB2 and erbB3, we show that these receptors localize preferentially in regions of the plasma membrane which are involved in facilitating cellular movement. Here, erbB2 colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with members of the focal complex including β1-integrin and focal adhesion kinase. Further, erbB receptor activation by neuregulin-1 enhances cell motility in two-dimensional scratch motility assays and stimulates cell invasion in three-dimensional Transwell migration assays. These effects of neuregulin-1 appear to involve the activation of focal adhesion kinase, which occurs downstream from erbB2 receptor stimulation. Taken together these data suggest that neuregulin-1 plays an important modulatory role in glioma cell invasion. Gliomas are the most frequently diagnosed adult primary brain malignancy.

Primary brain tumors are derived from the various types of cells of the central nervous system and include gliomas, neuroblastomas, ependymomas, and meningiomas. The most common adult primary brain tumor is the glioma, which is thought to arise from central nervous system glial cells. Of the gliomas, those classified as astrocytic tumors are the most frequently diagnosed (1Kleihues P. Burger P.C. Collins V.P. Newcomb E.W. Ohgaki H. Cavenee W.K. Kheihues P. Cavenee W.K. World Health Organization Classification of Tumors: Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Nervous System. IARC Press, Lyon2002: 2Google Scholar). Implicit in this classification is the assumption that astrocytic tumors arise from astrocytic glial cells. However, their precise lineage relationship is unknown; it is unclear whether these tumors arise from differentiated astrocytes or from their undifferentiated precursors. Indeed, there are striking similarities between neural precursors and gliomas such as their ability to migrate, often over long distances, through the brain (for review, see Ref. 2Dirks P.B. J. Neurooncol. 2001; 53: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Successful surgical treatment of patients diagnosed with a glioma is difficult because of this migratory phenotype. In particular, it is believed that cells at the tumor margin migrate away from their site of origin to colonize distant sites within the brain (3Bolteus A.J. Berens M.E. Pilkington G.J. Curr. Neurol. Neurosci. Rep. 2001; 1: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Berens M.E. Giese A. Neoplasia. 1999; 1: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying this aggressive phenotype are poorly understood. However, a number of factors have been implicated in promoting tumor cell invasion. These include the remodeling of the extracellular environment through the secretion of matrix proteases such as matrix metalloprotease-2 (5Sawaya R.E. Yamamoto M. Gokaslan Z.L. Wang S.W. Mohanam S. Fuller G.N. McCutcheon I.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Nicolson G.L. Rao J.S. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins such as laminins that facilitate tumor cell migration (6Tysnes B.B. Larsen L.F. Ness G.O. Mahesparan R. Edvardsen K. Garcia-Cabrera I. Bjerkvig R. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the mutation and/or overexpression of growth factor receptors capable of initiating intracellular signaling cascades that enhance cellular motility (7Kassis J.

One example of a growth factor receptor that has received particular attention in other malignancies is the erbB2 receptor. Specifically, in human breast cancer cell lines, ligand-dependent activation of erbB2 has been shown to promote cellular motility and invasiveness via activation of matrix proteases (9Yao J. Xiong S. Klos K. Nguyen N. Grijalva R. Li P. Yu D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8066-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 10Mazumdar A. Adam L. Boyd D. Kumar R.

ErbB2 is a member of the type 1 family of receptor tyrosine kinases which also includes erbB1, erbB3, and erbB4. Ligand-dependent activation of erbB receptors results in homo- or heterodimerization. This stimulates receptor auto- and/or transphosphorylation on cytoplasmic tyrosine residues creating binding sites for adaptor proteins, kinases, and phosphatases. The downstream signaling cascades initiated depend on the identity of the erbB heterodimers, which is determined, in part, by the specific erbB receptor ligand (15Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). Although erbB2 has no known ligand, it can be activated in a ligand-dependent manner via heterodimerization with other erbB receptors (16Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligands for erbB1 are numerous and include transforming growth factor-α and epidermal growth factor. ErbB3 and erbB4 bind with low and high affinity, respectively, to a family of polypeptide growth factors called the neuregulins (17Carraway III, K.L. Burden S.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is expressed by both neurons and glia (18Pinkas-Kramarski R. Eilam R.

Neurosci. 1999; 11: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, the extracellular domain of type I and type II NRG-1 isoforms contains an Ig-like motif that enables them to adhere to the extracellular environment (21Loeb J.A. Fischbach G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This allows them to function in a paracrine manner. Interestingly, recent findings (22Westphal M. Meima L. Szonyi E. Lofgren J. Meissner H. Hamel W. Nikolics K. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Neurooncol. 1997; 35: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) demonstrate that glioma cells can produce NRG-1 isoforms. Furthermore, erbB2 has been repeatedly reported to be overexpressed in human glioma biopsy samples and in a number of human glioma cell lines (22Westphal M. Meima L. Szonyi E. Lofgren J. Meissner H.

Neurosurgery. 1993; 33: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Despite this evidence, relatively little is known regarding the role of the NRG-1/erbB receptors in glioma cell biology. In an attempt to fill this void, we examined the potential for NRG-1 to modulate glioma cell motility. Our results demonstrate that the NRG-1 receptors erbB2 and erbB3 localize in regions of the plasma membrane involved in cellular movement. In addition, their activation by a recombinant form of NRG-1, NRG-1β, stimulates a functional association between erbB2 and FAK, thereby facilitating glioma cell migration. Cell Culture and Reagents—The U251-MG (U251) human glioma cell line was a gift from the laboratory of Dr. Y. Gillespie (University of Alabama at Birmingham). U87-MG and U118-MG human glioma cells were purchased from ATTC. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium F-12 (50/50), supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (MediaTech, University of Alabama at Birmingham Media Preparation Facility) and 7% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Recombinant NRG-1β was produced by the laboratory of Dr. S. Carroll (University of Alabama at Birmingham). Inhibitors Tyrphostin AG 825 (AG 825), PP2, and PP3 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at -20 °C. All chemicals and other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. In all experiments, control samples received the same concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide or other vehicle as experimental samples. Immunocytochemistry—For our initial erbB receptor immunostaining, U251 cells on uncoated glass coverslips were rinsed with sterile PBS and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were rinsed three times with PBS, then placed in a blocking buffer, which consisted of PBS, 5% normal goat serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After 30 min, cells were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Polyclonal antibodies for the erbB receptors (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used at 1 μg/ml (1:200). The following day, the cells were rinsed three times for 10 min with blocking buffer and then incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times for 10 min with PBS, mounted using mounting medium with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), visualized (Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope, Heerbrugg, Switzerland), and digitally imaged (Spot RT, Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). To study erbB2 localization in actively migrating glioma cells, U251 cells were fixed after a migration assay (see below). The cells and cellular processes on the undersurface of the Transwell filter were immunostained for erbB2 as above. The filter was then removed from the insert using a scalpel blade, mounted on a glass microscope slide, visualized, and imaged as above. For colocalization of erbB receptors with focal complex components, cells were processed as for a migration assay (see below). After 4 h, cells were fixed as above and double labeled with antibodies for erbB2 and one of the following mouse monoclonal antibodies: erbB3 (Santa Cruz), β1-integrin (Santa Cruz), FAK (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), or phalloidin-586 (Molecular Probes). Antibodies and phalloidin were used at the manufacturer's recommended dilution. Cells were visualized and imaged as above. Motility and Migration Assays—The scratch motility assay was used to measure two-dimensional movement. U251 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. A scratch was then made on the monolayer using a sterile 200-μl pipette tip. The monolayer was rinsed three times with migration assay buffer (MAB) consisting of serum-free medium plus 0.1% fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin and placed in MAB without or with 1 ng/ml NRG-1β. At the initiation of the experiment (t = 0) a digital image of the scar was taken at a magnification of ×10 (Axon Imaging, Foster City, CA). 24 h later (t = 24) the same region of the scar was imaged again. The images were imported into the Scion imaging program (available online at scioncorp.com). This software allowed us to quantify the two-dimensional movement of the cells by measuring the surface area of the scar at t = 0 and comparing it with the surface area at t = 24. Experiments were done at least three times. Measurements were made in triplicate. To measure three-dimensional movement, the Transwell migration assay was used as described previously (27Manning Jr., T.J. Parker J.C. Sontheimer H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Transwell filters (B-D Falcon, Bedford, MA) with 8-μm pores were coated on the undersurface with 10 μg/ml laminin. The following day, they were washed three times with PBS and blocked for 1 h with 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. In addition to providing a necessary substrate for migration, the laminin undercoating filled the 8-μm pores of the Transwell, creating a liquid diffusion barrier effectively dividing the well into two chambers, upper and lower, to which factor and/or inhibitors were added. Subconfluent U251 cells in 10-cm dishes were serum starved overnight. On the day of the experiment, they were lifted from the plate using 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in MAB to attain a concentration of 100,000 cells/ml. Equal numbers of cells (40,000/filter) were aliquoted onto the top surface of the Transwell filter and allowed to adhere for ∼30 min prior to the addition of any drugs. Inhibitors (AG 825, PP2, and PP3) were added for 30 min prior to the addition of NRG-1β. The cells were returned to the incubator for 4–6 h, rinsed with PBS, fixed, and stained with an ethanol-based crystal violet solution. Cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed using a cotton-tipped applicator. Cells on the lower surface of the filter were visualized and imaged as above for immunostaining. Experiments were repeated at least three times. Adhesion Assay—96-well plates were coated overnight with 10 μg/ml laminin. Cells were maintained as for a migration assay, plated at 25,000 cells/well using MAB, and treated with MAB without or with NRG-1β or NRG-1β plus AG 825. After 30 min, the cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed, and stained with crystal violet. The plates were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader at 590 nm and analyzed. Experiments were repeated at least four times. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on confluent U251 cells grown on 10-cm dishes. Cells were serum starved overnight. The following day, the cells were placed in MAB for at least 1 h prior to the addition of drugs. AG 825 was added for 30 min prior to the addition of NRG-1β. After 30 additional min, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 30 min with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma)) on a shaker at 4 °C. Lysates were placed in microcentrifuge tubes and spun for 4 min at 12,000 rpm to pellet the DNA. After determining the protein concentration using a detergent-compatible protein assay (Dc protein assay kit, Bio-Rad), lysates were diluted to equal concentrations (1 mg/ml) using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Samples were precleared with 5 μl of normal rabbit serum plus protein A beads or with beads alone. Primary antibodies were added to the precleared lysates at the following concentrations: 2 μg/ml erbB2, 6 μg/ml β1-integrin, and 5 μg/ml FAK. Lysates with primary antibodies were incubated with constant rotation overnight at 4 °C. The next day, 50 μl of agarose-conjugated protein A beads (Roche Applied Science) was added to each sample for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. For anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations, 30 μl/ml agarose-conjugated anti-PY 99 was used (Santa Cruz). Immunoprecipitates were pelleted at low speed at 4 °C and rinsed three times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. To release the immunoprecipitates from the beads, 2× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% brom-phenol blue, and 600 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) was added, and the samples were placed in boiling water for 5 min. Proteins were separated using 7.5% polyacrylamide ready gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and blocked overnight with 5% nonfat milk. The membranes were subsequently incubated in primary antibodies diluted in 5% nonfat milk for 2 h, rinsed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.19% Tween 20 three times for 10 min each, and probed with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:3,000) (Sigma) or mouse (1:2,000) (Santa Cruz) secondary antibody for 1 h. Membranes were rinsed three times for 10 min each, incubated with ECL Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences), exposed, and developed. ErbB2 and ErbB3 Receptors Are Localized in Lamellipodia— When cells move across a two-dimensional surface, they extend actin-rich processes called lamellipodia. Molecular components that are necessary for cellular adhesion and motility are concentrated within this lamellipodial extension (28Small J.V. Stradal T. Vignal E. Rottner K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 112-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). To examine whether erbB receptors also localize in this highly dynamic region of the membrane, we immunostained cultured glioma cells with antibodies specific for the NRG-1/erbB receptors, erbB2– 4 (Fig. 1). For this purpose, we used the U251 human glioma cell line. This cell line was isolated from a patient diagnosed with a highly invasive grade 4 glioblastoma and is frequently used as a model system to study invasive properties of gliomas. Cells were plated onto uncoated glass coverslips and maintained for at least 2 days prior to fixing and staining with antibodies specific to erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4. Representative examples (Fig. 1, A–C) demonstrate positive immunoreactivity for all three NRG-1/erbB receptors. However, only the immunostaining for erbB2 and erbB3 receptors showed prominent localization on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, A and B). Indeed, these receptors appeared to be concentrated in regions of the plasma membrane which resembled lamellipodia (Fig. 1, A and B, insets). NRG-1β Increases Motility of U251 Human Glioma Cells— Because erbB2 and erbB3 receptors localized in regions of the cell important for movement, we set out to determine whether their activation could modulate motility, defined herein as movement in a two-dimensional plane. This was accomplished by using a scratch motility assay in which the repopulation of cells into a cell-free region (scar) could be examined quantitatively. U251 cells were maintained until they reached confluence. Subsequently, a scar was created in the monolayer, and the cells were washed and placed in MAB without or with 1 ng/ml NRG-1β. We have demonstrated previously that exogenous NRG-1β can activate erbB2 and erbB3 receptors in U251 glioma cells as measured by induction of tyrosine phosphorylation (29Ritch P.S. Sontheimer H. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2001; : 473.7Google Scholar). After 24 h, the surface area of the scarred region was quantified using imaging software (see “Experimental Procedures”) and compared with the surface area of the scarred region at the initiation of the experiment. Movement of cells into the scarred region resulted in a decrease in the surface area of the scar. Fig. 2A is a digital image of the scarred region before (t = 0) and after the 24-h incubation period (t = 24) from a typical experiment. The same experiment is quantified in Fig. 2B. The overall change in the surface area of the scar for control, untreated samples was 31.83% ± 0.23%, whereas the change in the surface area of the scar for samples treated with 1 ng/ml NRG-1β was 52.48% ± 0.88%, an increase of about 20% (p < 0.001). NRG-1β Increases Transwell Migration of U251 Human Glioma Cells—Our results from the scratch motility assay indicated that NRG-1β could modulate glioma cell movement in a two-dimensional plane. In the brain, such movement is not likely. Instead, glioma cells must be able to migrate and invade through the three-dimensional spatial constraints of the surrounding brain tissue. To replicate this type of environment more closely, we employed a Transwell migration assay (Fig. 3). To induce glioma cell migration, it was necessary to coat the undersurface of the filter with an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein (data not shown). A similar dependence for ECM proteins is thought to occur with glioma cells in vivo (30Uhm J.H. Gladson C.L. Rao J.S. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D188-D199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We performed our migration assays using laminin, a potent inducer of U251 cell migration (27Manning Jr., T.J. Parker J.C. Sontheimer H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Serum-starved U251 glioma cells were plated onto the top of the Transwell filter and allowed to migrate for 4–6 h before they were fixed, stained, and counted. Fig. 3, A and B, shows representative digital images of cells on the undersurface of a filter which migrated in response to laminin alone (control) or in response to laminin plus 1 ng/ml NRG-1β added to the lower chamber. These images show that U251 cells migrated in response to laminin but that the number of migrating cells increased markedly in the presence of NRG-1β. Similar results were seen with two other human glioma cell lines, U87-MG and U118-MG (data not shown), suggesting that this was not a cell type-specific phenomenon. These experiments were repeated with the U251 glioma cell line using a concentration range of NRG-1β from 0.1 to 100 ng/ml. The resulting dose-response relationship is shown in Fig. 3C and Table I.Table ISummarized data from migration experiments displayed in Fig. 3Factor/DrugUpper concentrationLower concentrationFold change relative to controlNone1 ± 0.02NRG-1β0.1 ng/ml1.60 ± 0.05**NRG-1β1 ng/ml2.36 ± 0.02**NRG-1β10 ng/ml1.95 ± 0.04**NRG-1β100 ng/ml1.60 ± 0.03**NRG-1β1 ng/ml1.42 ± 0.07**NRG-1β1 ng/ml1 ng/ml1.94 ± 0.06**NRG-1β (1 ng/ml) + AG 8256.25 μm6.25 μm1.64 ± 0.12**NRG-1β (1 ng/ml) + AG 82512.5 μm12.5 μm1.26 ± 0.04*NRG-1β (1 ng/ml) + AG 82525.0 μm25.0 μm0.41 ± 0.04**NRG-1β (1 ng/ml) + AG 82550.0 μm50.0 μm0.36 ± 0.02** Open table in a new tab To determine whether NRG-1β effects on migration were permissive (chemokinetic) or instructive (chemotactic), we designed a series of Transwell experiments with 1) NRG-1β in the lower chamber, 2) NRG-1β in the upper chamber, or 3) NRG-1β in both the lower and upper chambers. The results for these studies are summarized in Fig. 3D and Table I. In each experimental configuration, NRG-1β significantly increased the number of cells successfully migrating through to the undersurface of the filter, implying that NRG-1β acted in a permissive manner. However, although migration was enhanced in each configuration, more cells were induced to migrate when NRG-1β was present in the bottom of the chamber (2.36 ± 0.02-fold increase) versus in the top (1.42 ± 0.07-fold increase), suggesting an instructive role (see “Discussion”). Although our data clearly indicated that NRG-1β could enhance the Transwell migration of glioma cells, a role for erbB2 in the effect was not conclusive. Therefore, we examined NRG-1β effects in the presence of the erbB2-specific pharmacological inhibitor, AG 825 (31Murillo H. Schmidt L.J. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7408-7412PubMed Google Scholar, 32Fernandes A. Hamburger A.W. Gerwin B.I. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Tsai C.M. Levitzki A. Wu L.H. Chang K.T. Cheng C.C. Gazit A. Perng R.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1068-1074PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, 1 ng/ml NRG-1β and increasing concentrations of AG 825 were included in both the upper and lower chambers. As demonstrated (Fig. 3E) AG 825 dose-dependently inhibited the NRG-1β-induced stimulation of Transwell migration with an apparent IC50 of 12.28 μm. Results for the migration experiments are summarized in Table I. Because the ability of cells to migrate depends critically on their interactions with the ECM, we next examined the potential effect of NRG-1β on the adhesion of U251 cells to laminin. Serum-starved cells were plated onto a laminin-coated 96-well plate and allowed to adhere for 30 min to 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed, fixed, and stained. The number of adherent cells was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. As indicated (Fig. 3F), the ability of the U251 cells to adhere to laminin was not altered by exposing the cells to a range of NRG-1β concentrations, or to 50 μm AG 825. ErbB2 Receptor Immunoreactivity Localizes to the Invadipodia of Migrating Cells and Colocalizes with the Focal Complex Proteins β1-Integrin and FAK—Thus far, our results indicated that stimulation of glioma cells by NRG-1β could enhance motility and migration. Our initial immunostaining (Fig. 1) demonstrated that the erbB2 and erbB3 receptors localized in regions of the plasma membrane called lamellipodia. We hypothesized that this localization might help facilitate the ability of the receptors to modulate migration. To investigate further, we performed erbB2 immunostaining in actively migrating cells. For these studies, we used the same Transwell migration assays; however, instead of fixing and staining the cells for cell counting, we processed them for immunostaining of the erbB2 receptor. As with the migration assays (see “Experimental Procedures”), cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed, leaving only the cells and the invading processes on the undersurface. The invading processes of the migrating cells, called invadipodia (34Chen W.T. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), contain the components necessary for migration into the pore. The digital image displayed in Fig. 4 is a composite image made by combining sample images taken from the undersurface of one Transwell filter. For this experiment, the cells were exposed to 1 ng/ml NRG-1β in both the upper and lower chambers. It is clear from this composite that the erbB2 receptor localized in the invadipodia. The morphology of the invadipodia varied depending on the temporal status of the cells in the migration process. We saw no significant difference in the erbB2 staining pattern from cells on filters that were unstimulated, exposed to NRG-1β in the lower chamber only, or exposed to NRG-1β plus AG 825 (data not shown), suggesting the constitutive and invariant expression of these receptors on glioma cells. In light of our immunostaining results localizing erbB2 in invadipodia and based on evidence from the literature indicating the presence of focal complex proteins in these processes (34Chen W.T. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we decided to examine whether erbB2 could colocalize with other molecules implicated in the migration process. Specifically, we examined the localization of erbB2 with F-actin, the polymerized form of actin which is present in these cellular extensions (35Nakahara H. Mue"

https://openalex.org/W1974665653,"The NADH-quinone oxidoreductase fromParacoccus denitrificans consists of 14 subunits (Nqo1–14) and contains one FMN and eight iron-sulfur clusters. The Nqo3 subunit possesses fully conserved 11 Cys and 1 His in its N-terminal region and is considered to harbor three iron-sulfur clusters; however, only one binuclear (N1b) and one tetranuclear (N4) were previously identified. In this study, the Nqo3 subunit containing 1×[2Fe-2S] and 2×[4Fe-4S] clusters was expressed in Escherichia coli. The second [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster is detected by EPR spectroscopy below 6 K, exhibiting very fast spin relaxation. The resolved EPR spectrum of this cluster is broad and nearly axial. The subunit exhibits an absorption-type EPR signal around g ∼ 5 region below 6 K, most likely arising from an S = 3/2 ground state of the fast-relaxing [4Fe-4S]1+ species. The substitution of the conserved His106 with Cys specifically affected the fast-relaxing [4Fe-4S]1+cluster, suggesting that this cluster is coordinated by His106. In the cholate-treated NDH-1-enriched P. denitrificans membranes, we observed EPR signals arising from a [4Fe-4S] cluster below 6 K, exhibiting properties similar to those of cluster N5 detected in other complex I/NDH-1 and of the fast-relaxing [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster in the expressed Nqo3 subunit. Hence, we propose that the His-coordinated [4Fe-4S] cluster corresponds to cluster N5."
https://openalex.org/W2038742562,"We describe here biochemical characterization of the 20 S proteasome from the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. Similar to the mammalian proteasome, the T. brucei proteasome is made up of seven α- and seven β-subunits. Of the seven β-type subunits, five contain pro-sequences that are proteolytically removed during assembly, and three of them are predicted to be catalytic based on primary sequence. Affinity labeling studies revealed that, unlike the mammalian proteasome where three β-subunits were labeled by the affinity reagents, only two β-subunits of the T. brucei proteasome were labeled in the complex. These two subunits corresponded to β2 and β5 subunits responsible for the trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like proteolytic activities, respectively. Screening of a library of 137,180 tetrapeptide fluorogenic substrates against theT. brucei 20 S proteasome confirmed the nominal β1-subunit (caspase-like or PGPH) activity and identified an overall substrate preference for hydrophobic residues at the P1 to P4 positions in a substrate. This overall stringency is relaxed in the 11 S regulator (PA26)-20 S proteasome complex, which shows both appreciable activities for cleavage after acidic amino acids and a broadened activity for cleavage after basic amino acids. The 20 S proteasome fromT. brucei also shows appreciable activity for cleavage after P1-Gln that is minimally observed in the human counterpart. These results demonstrate the importance of substrate sequence specificity of the T. brucei proteasome and highlight its biochemical divergence from the human enzyme.

Entry of substrate into the catalytic chamber is assisted by binding of a 19 S regulatory “cap” complex at the top and bottom of the 20 S CP (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). This regulatory complex contains six ATPase subunits and 11 non-ATPase subunits and is required for the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar,7Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Additionally, substrate-binding properties of the CP can be altered by binding of an 11 S regulator complex, resulting in enhanced proteolytic activity and production of extended peptide substrate required for major histocompatibility complex class I-mediated antigen presentation (9Preckel T. Fung-Leung W.P. Cai Z. Vitiello A. Salter-Cid L. Winqvist O. Wolfe T.G. Von Herrath M. Angulo A. Ghazal P. Lee J.D. Fourie A.M. Wu Y. Pang J. Ngo K. Peterson P.A. Fruh K. Yang Y.

Yamamura K. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The human 11 S regulator protein has also recently been shown to alter the cleavage pattern and substrate specificity of the CP (12Nazif T. Bogyo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2967-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic proteasomes possess multiple peptidase activities that are classified into three major categories based upon the primary amino acid residues found at the site of hydrolysis. The “chymotrypsin-like” activity cleaves substrates after hydrophobic residues and is thought to be the primary activity of the complex required for initial attack on protein substrates. The “trypsin-like” activity cleaves substrates after basic residues and the “peptidyl-glutamyl peptide hydrolytic” (PGPH) or “caspase-like” activity cleaves after acidic residues (13Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10289-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 14Rivett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12215-12219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These primary hydrolytic activities have been linked through mutagenesis and inhibitor studies to three catalytically active β subunits: β1, β2, and β5 (15Enenkel C. Lehmann H. Kipper J. Guckel R. Hilt W. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These studies have assigned the chymotryptic activity to β5, the tryptic activity to β2, and the PGPH activity to β1 (16Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7156-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis by the proteasome is catalyzed by activation of a bound water molecule by the free N-terminal threonine residue found on all catalytically active β subunits (17Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). These N-terminal threonine residues are generated by proteolytic cleavage of extended precursor proteins during proteasome assembly, which serves as the primary mechanism to prevent pre-mature activation of incompletely assembled complexes (18Zwickl P. Kleinz J. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition, a lysine residue at position 33 of the mature β-subunit protein is essential for catalysis (19Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 20Seemuller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Although the primary protease activities of the proteasome have been classified based on the amino acid residues found at the site of amide bond hydrolysis (P1 position), extensive inhibitor (21Bogyo M. Shin S.B. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), substrate (22Harris J.L. Alper P.B. Li J. Rechsteiner M. Backes B.J. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and structural (23Groll M. Nazif T. Huber R. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) studies have confirmed the importance of extended substrate recognition by the proteasome. In particular, variations at the P4 position of a substrate or inhibitor have a profound effect on recognition by individual β subunits (21Bogyo M. Shin S.B. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 22Harris J.L. Alper P.B. Li J. Rechsteiner M. Backes B.J. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent observations suggested that the primary proteolytic activities of the mammalian proteasome might be linked through allosteric interactions in a bite-chew model (24Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Castillo V. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 395-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear if this substrate-induced regulation of hydrolysis may in fact result from multiple substrate binding sites on a single catalytic subunit. Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protozoan that is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. Resistance to commonly used anti-trypanosomal chemotherapeutics presents a potentially serious problem for most parts of sub-Saharan Africa (25Borst P. Fairlamb A.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 745-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Maser P. Sutterlin C. Kralli A. Kaminsky R. Science. 1999; 285: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Several unique characteristics of proteasome-mediated protein degradation in T. brucei have been recently reported. First, mouse ornithine decarboxylase expressed in T. bruceitogether with a rat antizyme was found to be highly stable (27Bass K.E. Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11034-11037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas this same protein complex is rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome in mammalian cells (28Hua S.B. Li X. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10264-10271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Second, down-regulation of expression of each of the 7 α-subunits, 7 β-subunits, the 6 ATPase subunits, and the 11 non-ATPase subunits of the 26 S proteasome by RNA interference in T. brucei leads to intracellular accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and blocked cell growth (29Li Z. Zou C.-B. Yao Y. Hoyt M.A. McDonough S. Mackey Z.B. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15486-15498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,30Li Z. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42686-42693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Third, the 11 S regulator PA26–20 S proteasome complex constitutes the predominant complex in T. brucei (31Yao Y. Huang L. Krutchinsky A. Wong M.L. Standing K.G. Burlingame A.L. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33921-33930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), yet a down-regulation of PA26 expression by RNA interference results in no detectable phenotype in the insect form of T. brucei (29Li Z. Zou C.-B. Yao Y. Hoyt M.A. McDonough S. Mackey Z.B. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15486-15498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not clear how the various forms of proteasome in T. brucei are regulated for coordinated protein degradation, cell cycle progression, and development of T. brucei. A detailed biochemical analysis of the proteasome from T. brucei may help to explain how this enzyme complex differs from the human homolog. Such information is likely to help find ways to specifically target this essential cellular component of protein breakdown for therapeutic gain. In the present study, we describe the subunit composition and biochemical properties of the T. brucei proteasome. Surprisingly, although five of the seven β-subunits undergo apparent post-translational modifications via proteolytic removal of a portion of the N termini, only two show proteolytic activity as measured by labeling with irreversible inhibitors. The profile of peptidase activities in the T. brucei 20 S proteasome suggests a stringent substrate specificity for the β1 and the β2 subunit and a broad substrate specificity for the β5 subunit. These profiles became considerably less selective and included an increase in the caspase-like activity when the PA26 heptamer rings bound the 20 S CP, suggesting an 11 S regulator-induced structure-function change of the β-subunits. Comparison of overall substrate specificity of theT. brucei and human proteasome suggests that subtle differences exist that may aid in the design of specific inhibitors of this essential protease complex in trypanosome. T. brucei 427 strain procyclic form cells were cultured in Cunningham's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at a final concentration of 10% (32Cunningham I. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Purification of the 20 S proteasome from T. bruceiprocyclic form cells was carried out as previously described (33Hua S. To W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The human 20 S proteasome, purified from outdated human blood by previously described methods (34Realini C. Jensen C.C. Zhang Z. Johnston S.C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Prof. Martin Rechsteiner of the University of Utah. Two-dimensional protein gel analysis of the purified T. brucei 20 S proteasome was carried out as previously described (31Yao Y. Huang L. Krutchinsky A. Wong M.L. Standing K.G. Burlingame A.L. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33921-33930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The separated subunit proteins in the gel were stained with Coomassie Blue, and each protein spot was subjected to Edman degradations for N-terminal sequence determination at the Protein Core Facility, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY. 4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-vinylsulfone (NP-L3-VS), Tyr-Leu-Leu-Leu-vinylsulfone (YL3-VS), and 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenol-Leu-Leu-Asn-vinylsulfone (NP-L2N-VS) were synthesized and iodinated with125I as described (21Bogyo M. Shin S.B. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 35Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Leupeptin (acetyl-Leu-Leu-dl-Arginal) was purchased from Boehringer Manheim. Fluorogenic peptides succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-4-methyl-7-aminocoumarin Suc-(LLVY-MAC) and Gly-Gly-Arg-4-methyl-7-aminocoumarin (GGR-MAC) were purchased from Sigma. For peptidase assay, 1 μg of the purified 20 S proteasome fromT. brucei was suspended in 100 μl of the peptidase assay buffer; 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. Individual vinylsulfone derivatives or leupeptin were each added to the proteasome-containing peptidase assay buffer at varying concentrations and incubated at 25 °C for 45 min prior to adding 1 μl of a 5 mm stock solution of fluorogenic peptide substrate. The assay mixture was further incubated at 25 °C for 60 min, and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction was stopped by 100 μl of 2% SDS. The fluorescence in the mixture was measured with a fluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Purified T. brucei 20 S proteasome (1–3 μg) was suspended in 100 μl of TSDG (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20% glycerol). 125I-YL3-VS,125I-NP-L3-VS, and125I-NP-L2N-VS were each added at 1.8 × 104 Bq/ml. The labeling reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 60 min and then stopped by adding 25 μl of 5× Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the reaction mixture (21Bogyo M. Shin S.B. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, 1–3 μg of the purified T. brucei 20 S proteasome was preincubated with the unlabeled inhibitors (as indicated) under the identical conditions as for the labeling experiment. 125I-YL3-VS was then added to the reaction mixture at 1.8 × 104 Bq/ml. Protein labeling proceeded at 25 °C for 60 min and was then stopped by adding 25 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer as before. The radiolabeled protein was fractionated and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The purified recombinant T. brucei 11 S regulator protein PA26 was prepared as previously described (31Yao Y. Huang L. Krutchinsky A. Wong M.L. Standing K.G. Burlingame A.L. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33921-33930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purified T. brucei 20 S proteasome (24 nm for assays without PA26, 2.4 nm for assays with 640 nm PA26) in a buffer containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min to allow for association of the 20 S proteasome with PA26. The preincubated proteasome was then added to the substrate libraries, which were synthesized using methods described previously (22Harris J.L. Alper P.B. Li J. Rechsteiner M. Backes B.J. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The substrate concentration was 15 nm/substrate/well in the one-position fixed library at 6859 substrates/well (Cys was excluded and Met was replaced by the isosteric non-natural amino acid norleucine (Nle)). In the two-position fixed library, the substrate concentration was 0.25 μm/substrate/well at 361 substrates/well (Cys was excluded and Met was replaced by Nle). Fluorescence was monitored for 30 min at λex of 380 nm and λem of 450 nm in a Molecular Devices Gemini XS microtiter plate reader. The purified human 20 S proteasome was used to screen the substrate libraries by the same procedures (22Harris J.L. Alper P.B. Li J. Rechsteiner M. Backes B.J. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The following substrate sequences were designed to be selective substrates for the β1, β2, and β5 subunits for both the human and the T. brucei proteasome: acetyl-EPFD-7-amino-4-carbamoylcoumarin (acc), acetyl-norleucine(n)RnR-acc, and acetyl-HHSL-acc. An additional substrate was designed based on the substrate specificity for cleavage after P1-Gln observed in the T. brucei proteasome, acetyl-YWTQ-acc. The purified 20 S proteasomes from human and T. brucei at a concentration of 20 nm were preincubated for 10 min in the assay buffer containing, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. Substrates were added at multiple concentrations, from 0.00001 to 1.75 mm (depending on solubility) to the preincubated enzyme, and substrate hydrolysis was monitored for 90 min at λexof 380 nm and λem of 450 nm in a Molecular Devices Gemini XS microtiter plate reader. Data were fit using non-linear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation and values fork cat, K m, andk cat/K m were determined. Samples of purified T. brucei 20 S proteasome were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue (data not shown). The identity of each protein spot on the stained gel was previously determined by mass spectrometric analysis (31Yao Y. Huang L. Krutchinsky A. Wong M.L. Standing K.G. Burlingame A.L. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33921-33930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The molecular masses and pI values of each of the identified subunit proteins were estimated by their positions in the two-dimensional gel. These values were compared with the molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) of each of the α- and the β-subunits of T. brucei20 S proteasome calculated based on sequences of the full-length cDNAs encoding each protein (see footnote 2 and Tables I andII). 2The GenBankTM database accession numbers of the DNA sequences encoding the 14 subunits of T. brucei 20 S proteasome are as follows: α1, AF198386; α2,AF148125; α3, AF198387; α4, AF169652; α5, AF140353; α6,AJ131148; α7, AF169651; β1, AJ131043; β2, AJ130820; β3,AF169653; β4, AF226673; β5, AF226674; β6, AF148124; and β7,AF290945.

This subunit has a calculated pI of 9.24 but an experimentally determined pI of 6.1. The molecular basis for this discrepancy remains unclear. On the other hand, five of the seven β-subunits demonstrated significantly lower molecular masses by two-dimensional gel when compared with their calculated molecular weights from the encoding cDNAs (Table I). These subunits, β1, β2, β5, β6, and β7, also showed significant differences between their calculated and experimental pI values (Table II). N-terminal sequence analysis of each of the 14 identified protein spots indicated that all the α-subunits with the exception of α3 have blocked N termini. The experimentally determined N-terminal sequence of α3 was identical to that of the predicted sequence, indicating no post-translational modification at its N terminus. Despite having blocked N termini, the α2, α4, α5, α6, and α7 subunits had very similar predicted and measured molecular weights and pI values, suggesting a lack of significant modification of their N termini. However, a major post-translational modification of α1 may have occurred, resulting in a blocked N terminus, a decreased molecular mass, and a dramatic decrease in its pI value (from 9.24 to 6.1). The precise structural changes involved in this post-translational modification remain to be elucidated. Among the β-subunits, only β4 was found blocked at its N terminus. This N-terminal modification does not result in a major change in either its molecular weight or its pI (Tables I and II). Sequencing of β3 indicated that its N terminus matched that predicted by the encoding cDNA, whereas the remaining five β-subunits each lost a portion of their N termini (Fig. 1). N-terminal sequencing of these subunits identified N-terminal truncation of 53 residues from β1, 29 residues from β2, 46 residues from β5, 41 residues from β6, and 5 residues from β7. The molecular weights and pI values derived from the corresponding truncated cDNAs agree well with those observed from the two-dimensional gel (Tables I and II). Among the five truncated β-subunits, β1 and β2 have an N-terminal amino acid sequence of TTI, whereas β5 has the sequence TTTL, both of which are typical of the N termini of catalytically active β-subunits (19Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 20Seemuller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is a conserved catalytic lysine residue at position 33 of each of these three matured β proteins (Fig.2). The mature β6 and β7 subunits, on the other hand, lack both the catalytic Thr-1 and Lys-33 residues (Fig. 2), thus suggesting that β1, β2, and β5 are the only catalytically active subunits of the T. brucei 20 S proteasome.Figure 2Labeling of the catalytically active β-subunits in T. brucei 20 S proteasome with irreversible inhibitors. The125I-vinylsulfones used in the individual labeling experiments are indicated at the top of eachlane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Peptide vinylsulfone derivatives have been shown to function as irreversible inhibitors of the three primary peptidase activities of the mammalian and yeast 20 S proteasomes (21Bogyo M. Shin S.B. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These small molecule inhibitors act by formation of a covalent bond with the catalytic Thr-1 hydroxyl residues in each of the active β subunits. Because inhibition results in permanent modification of the active subunits, the radiolabeled version of these compounds can be used for biochemical analysis of each of the proteasome active sites. The peptide vinylsulfones, 125I-NP-L3-VS and125I-YL3-VS, can be used to label the β1, β2, and β5 as well as the γ-interferon-inducible subunits β1i (LMP-2), β2i (MECL-1), and β5i (LMP-7) of the human 20 S proteasome (21Bogyo M. Shin S.B. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, these compounds label the active sites with different relative intensities based on binding affinity, with YL3-VS having a dramatically increased activity for the β2 and β2i subunits (21Bogyo M. Shin S.B. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Labeling of purified T. brucei 20 S proteasome with125I-YL3-VS revealed modification of only two subunits of apparent molecular masses of 22.7 and 24.0 kDa (Fig. 2). The identity of these two subunits was confirmed as the β5 and the β2 subunits, respectively, by mapping of the labeled proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Surprisingly, this radiolabeled vinylsulfone failed to label the T. brucei β1 subunit (24.7 kDa), predicted to be catalytically active based on primary sequence and homology to the mammalian β1 subunit. This result suggests that the β1 either has a dramatically altered substrate specificity compared with the mammalian 20 S proteasome and is not sensitive to labeling or it is catalytically inactive. Interestingly, even upon addition of the PA26 cap complex to the 20 S core, the β1 subunit still failed to label with the general affinity probe (data not shown). Affinity labeling of the T. brucei proteasome with the related peptide vinylsulfone, 125I-NP-L3-VS resulted in modification of only the β5 subunit, indicating an extended substrate specificity similar to that observed in the mammalian enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2053775289,"The ClC-2 chloride channel has been implicated in essential physiological functions. Analyses of ClC-2 knock-out mice suggest that ClC-2 expression in retinal pigment epithelia and Sertoli cells normally supports the viability of photoreceptor cells and male germ cells, respectively. Further, other studies suggest that ClC-2 expression in neurons may modify inhibitory synaptic transmission via the γ-aminobutyric acid, type A receptor. However, complete understanding of the physiological functions of ClC-2 requires elucidation of the molecular basis for its regulation. Using cell imaging and biochemical and electrophysiological techniques, we show that expression of ClC-2 at the cell surface may be regulated via an interaction with the dynein motor complex. Mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis of eluate from a ClC-2 affinity matrix showed that heavy and intermediate chains of dynein bind ClC-2in vitro. The dynein intermediate chain co-immunoprecipitates with ClC-2 from hippocampal membranes suggesting that they also interact in vivo. Disruption of dynein motor function perturbs ClC-2 localization and increases the functional expression of ClC-2 in the plasma membranes of COS7 cells. Thus, cell surface expression of ClC-2 may be regulated by dynein motor activity. This work is the first to demonstrate an in vivointeraction between an ion channel and the dynein motor complex. The ClC-2 chloride channel has been implicated in essential physiological functions. Analyses of ClC-2 knock-out mice suggest that ClC-2 expression in retinal pigment epithelia and Sertoli cells normally supports the viability of photoreceptor cells and male germ cells, respectively. Further, other studies suggest that ClC-2 expression in neurons may modify inhibitory synaptic transmission via the γ-aminobutyric acid, type A receptor.

Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant ClC-2 in Xenopus oocytes (2Thiemann A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) and in mammalian cells (3Schwiebert E.M. Cid-Soto L.P. Stafford D. Carter M. Blaisdell C.J. Zeitlin P.L. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) confers the expression of a hyperpolarization and swelling-activated chloride conductance path exhibiting an inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship. Recent studies in which ClC-2 expression was disrupted in model organisms support the claim that ClC-2 directly mediates this chloride conductance. For example, a chloride conductance path with the above biophysical properties was detected in studies of salivary gland cells obtained from normal mice whereas this function was absent in salivary gland cells obtained from ClC-2 knock-out mice (4Nehrke K. Arreola J. Nguyen H.V. Pilato J. Richardson L. Okunade G. Baggs R. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23604-23611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similarly, depletion of theCaenorhabditis elegans ortholog of ClC-2, CLH-3, in maturing oocytes by RNA interference leads to the complete abrogation of the native, inwardly rectifying chloride conductance (5Rutledge E.

Biol. 2001; 11: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The physiological consequences of disrupting ClC-2 expression in these organisms implicate a role for this channel at the cell surface in modifying extracellular microenvironments or cell-cell communication (5Rutledge E.

These defects have been attributed to altered chloride conductance across the plasma membrane of retinal pigment epithelium and Sertoli cells, affecting the microenvironment surrounding photoreceptors and male germ cells, respectively. Localization of ClC-2 to the apical membrane of fetal lung epithelia suggests a role in regulating airway surface fluid (7Murray C.B. Chu S. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L829-L837PubMed Google Scholar, 8Blaisdell C.J. Pellettieri J.P. Loughlin C.E. Chu S. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, ClC-2 channel function has been implicated in mediating intestinal fluid secretion, as it has been localized close to the apical tight junctions of intestinal epithelia (9Gyomorey K. Yeger H. Ackerley C. Garami E. Bear C.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1787-C1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8306-8313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Detailed studies have revealed that ClC-2 channels are also localized to intracellular vesicular compartments. Electron micrographs of immunogold-labeled ClC-2 endogenously expressed in hippocampal neurons show that it is localized not only to the plasma membrane of somata, proximal dendrites, axon initial segments but also to small transport vesicles in the cytosol (11Sik A. Smith R.L. Freund T.F. Neuroscience. 2000; 101: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This expression pattern is similar to that described previously for the γ-aminobutyric acid, type A receptor and suggests that, as in the case of the γ-aminobutyric acid, type A receptor, the number of ClC-2 channels on the cell surface may be regulated by vesicular transport. In fact, recent studies by Bali et al. (12Bali M. Lipecka J. Edelman A. Fritsch J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1588-C1598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, a lipid kinase with a well established role in membrane trafficking, reduce the basal amplitude of ClC-2-mediated chloride currents measured by patch clamp electrophysiology on the cell surface (12Bali M. Lipecka J. Edelman A. Fritsch J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1588-C1598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cell surface expression of ClC-2 may be regulated via membrane trafficking. However, as yet, little is known regarding the molecular components that regulate the cell surface expression of ClC-2. In the present study, using an integrated approach involving biochemical and cell imaging and electrophysiological techniques, we show that ClC-2 interacts with the retrograde dynein motor complexin vitro and in vivo. Further, this interaction likely mediates trafficking of ClC-2 as the subcellular distribution and functional expression of this channel at the cell surface is disrupted by inhibition of dynein function. To our knowledge, these are the first results to demonstrate an in vivo interaction between an ion channel and the dynein motor complex. The antisense ClC-2 construct was made by cloning the rat ClC-2 open reading frame into pCDNA 3.1(−) vector so that the reversed restriction sites on this vector would reverse the orientation of the open reading frame to create the antisense plasmid (10Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8306-8313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The constructs for the expression of GFP1-tagged dynamitin, and DSRed-tagged CC1 were kindly provided by Dr. T. Schroer (The Johns Hopkins University). For immunofluorescence analysis, endogenous ClC-2 was detected using a peptide-purified polyclonal antibody (8 μg/ml) directed against the N terminus of ClC-2. Dynein complex was labeled with a monoclonal antibody against the intermediate chain (IC) of dynein (1:100; Chemicon, Pittsburgh, PA), early endosomal compartments with monoclonal anti-EEA1 antibody (1:200; BD Biosciences), and tubulin with monoclonal anti-α tubulin (1:2000; Sigma). Fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (in 50% glycerol; 1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) secondary antibodies were used. For immunogold labeling, goat anti-rabbit IgG 10-nm gold complexes and goat anti-mouse IgG 5-nm gold complexes (Amersham Biosciences) were used. Several antibodies were screened for the detection of endogenous dynein: two monoclonal antibodies against the dynein heavy chain (DHC) and intermediate chain (DIC) subunits, respectively (Sigma), and one against the intermediate chain (Chemicon). However, only the Chemicon antibody exhibited positive immunoreactivity upon analysis of rat hippocampal homogenate (anti-dynein IC; 1:1,000; Chemicon). Endogenous ClC-2 was detected using polyclonal antibodies raised against either the N or the C terminus of ClC-2 (directed against residues 31–74 and 869–907 of rat ClC-2, respectively). Where relevant, actin detection with a monoclonal actin antibody (1:1,000; Sigma) was used as a control for equal protein loading. COS7 cells (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured at 37 °C in minimum essential medium (Wisent Inc., Montreal, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were generally grown to 30% confluency prior to transfection, as well as for patch clamp experiments. Transfections were performed on cells (seeded onto 35-mm coverslips 12 h prior to transfection) with SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Cells were incubated with transfection reagent for 3–6 h in 5% serum-supplemented medium, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Wisent Inc.), and grown for 16–24 h. For nocodazole experiments, cells were washed three times with PBS, followed by a 30-min incubation with 35 μm nocodazole (methyl-(5-2-thienylcarbonyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate; Sigma) in serum-free medium, at either 4 or 37 °C. For experiments requiring drug recovery, cells were washed extensively with PBS following exposure to nocodazole and incubated with serum-supplemented medium for 120 min. In cycloheximide treatment experiments, cells were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with growth medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for 4 h to arrest protein synthesis. For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were washed with PBS followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton in PBS. Coverslips were blocked in 5% goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS for 2 h followed by a 1-h incubation in primary antibody diluted to the desired concentration in blocking buffer. Coverslips were washed in blocking buffer for 30 min before incubation in secondary antibody for 1 h and washed again in PBS before mounting with DAKO (DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark) medium. For double-labeling experiments, two primary antibodies developed in different species were applied together, followed by simultaneous detection using Cy3 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibodies. Slides were analyzed with a Carl Zeiss confocal laser microscope (LSM 510) under a ×63 objective. Optical sections were generally 0.7–0.9 μm thick. The extent of co-localization of ClC-2 with EEA1 was quantified using a modification of methods described previously (44Janevski J. Park P.C. De Boni U. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 45Martou G. De Boni U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, background-corrected EEA1-specific immunofluorescence was subtracted from ClC-2-specific immunofluorescence to yield a “difference” image (using Scion Image; Scion Corporation). Vesicular structures within this difference image represent ClC-2 and EEA1 co-localized within endosomes. The extent of co-localization of ClC-2 with EEA1 was determined as the percent intensity of the co-localized signal relative to the total ClC-2-specific immunofluorescence. ImageJ (NIH imaging) was employed for line scanning analysis to quantitatively assess ClC-2 subcellular distribution in COS7 cells. Lines were typically drawn from the periphery of the nucleus to the cell edge through the intracellular staining pattern for ClC-2. This line was then divided into four equal segments. The fluorescence intensity for each segment was quantified and expressed as a fraction of total fluorescence intensity. Paraformaldehyde- and glutaraldehyde-fixed COS7 cells were infused with a solution of 10% gelatin in PBS at 37 °C, allowed to gel at 4 °C, and infused with 2.3 m sucrose overnight. Ultrathin sections (100 nm) were mounted on Formvar-coated nickel grids. Sections were labeled with ClC-2 and/or dynein antibodies as described previously (9Gyomorey K. Yeger H. Ackerley C. Garami E. Bear C.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1787-C1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Controls included the omission of either of the primary antisera. Specimens were examined and images acquired with a JEOL JEM transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA) equipped with a digital camera (AMT Corp., Danvers, MA). 1 ml Hi-Trap columns (Amersham Biosciences) were injected with either 10 mg/ml amylase (Sigma) or ClC-2, purified as described previously (14Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Huan L.J. Garami E. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13838-13847Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in 0.2m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3 (supplemented with 4% pentadecafluorooctanoic acid (Dakwood Products Inc., West Columbia, SC) for the application of purified ClC-2). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the column was washed with Buffer A (0.5 m ethanolamine, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3), followed by Buffer B (0.1 m acetate, 0.5m NaCl, pH 4.0). Mouse brain lysate was passed through the column, equilibrated previously with 1% Triton in PBS, pH 8.0. Briefly, tissue was homogenized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS with protease inhibitors, 10 mg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mmbenzamidine, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm E64, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Homogenate was spun at 100,000× g for 2 h to remove unsolubilized material before application to the column. The column was then washed twice in equilibration buffer, and bound protein was eluted with 4% pentadecafluorooctanoic acid in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 4.0. 1-ml fractions were collected, and protein content was assayed by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions containing the highest levels of protein (18van Deurs B. Petersen O.W. Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 171: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Le T.L. Yap A.S.

Following determination of protein concentration using a modified Lowry protocol, eluant from all three columns was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–12% Tris-glycine, NOVEX) and silver staining. For Western blotting analysis, antibodies were diluted to the required working concentrations in blocking buffer (5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS). For sequential probing of the same samples, membranes were stripped by washing in SDS-stripping buffer at 55–60 °C for 40 min. Blots were first re-blocked and re-probed with secondary antibody to confirm effective stripping, before incubation with the desired antibody. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed by the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at the Molecular Medicine Research Centre (University of Toronto). Briefly, the dominant protein band (100 kDa) eluted from the ClC-2 affinity column was excised from the silver-stained gel, washed twice with acetonitrile followed by 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate, and digested with 6.25 ng of trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 4 mmCaCl2, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C overnight. Tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel slice with two washes of 100 μl each of 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Pooled peptides were acidified by addition of acetic acid to 1% and reverse phase extracted with a 1:1 suspension of C18 silica resin. Resin was washed with two 100-μl aliquots of 2% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid, and peptides were eluted with 5 μl of 65% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid. A MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprint was obtained with an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE STR instrument using α-cyano hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. Hippocampal slices (300-μm thickness) were prepared from adult male rats (Sprague-Dawley, 150–200 g; Charles River) as described previously (13Wan Q. Man H.Y. Braunton J. Wang W. Salter M.W. Becker L. Wang Y.T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5062-5069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A crude membrane preparation was obtained from tissue homogenate (in PBS with protease inhibitors by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h following a 10-min low speed spin at 2,000 × g to pellet nuclei and unlysed cells. For co-immunoprecipitations, 500 μg of protein from crude membrane preparations were solubilized in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) SDS, 1% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors) at 37 °C for 10 min. Samples were spun at 15,000 × g to sediment unsolubilized protein aggregates and incubated with ClC-2 antibody (2 μg/ml) for 16 h at 4 °C. The antibody-protein complexes were adsorbed from solution with protein A-Agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were eluted from beads with SDS loading buffer containing 63 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 25 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were reduced with 10 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine and analyzed for the presence of dynein and ClC-2. COS7 fibroblasts grown to 70% confluency on 15-cm dishes were incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed with biotinylation buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8) and then incubated with 1.0 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido) ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. Biotinylation was quenched by rinsing cells with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were then lysed with modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors). Solubilized cell extracts were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were incubated with streptavidin beads (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C, and biotinylated proteins were eluted from beads with 63 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mmEDTA, 2% (w/v) SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mmdithiothreitol. Eluants were then analyzed for the presence of ClC-2. COS7 membrane currents were measured using conventional whole cell patch clamp technique as described previously (10Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8306-8313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, currents were measured using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and were filtered at 100 Hz with a six-pore Bessel Filter. Sampling rate was 4 kHz for most data, and junction potentials were corrected. Voltage clamp protocols were generated using pCLAMP software (version 7; Axon Instruments). Current-voltage relationships were determined in a stepwise clamp protocol. From a holding potential of 30 mV, voltage pulses of 3.0 s were applied from −140 to +40 mV in 20-mV increments. The bath solution contained 140 mm N-methyl-d-glutamine chloride, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mmHEPES, whereas the pipette solution contained 140 mm N-methyl-d-glutamine chloride, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES. Both pipette and bath solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4 and 260 milliosmoles. Patch clamp and immunofluorescence quantitation data are presented as the means ± S.E. Most statistical analyses were performed using the Student's unpaired t test. Results obtained in patch clamp studies with drug-treated and -transfected cells were analyzed using the unpaired Student'st test. Differences between multiple treatment groups were assessed by ANOVA, and differences between specific pairs were subsequently analyzed using the Bonferroni method. As previous studies by Bali et al. (12Bali M. Lipecka J. Edelman A. Fritsch J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1588-C1598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) implicate a role for vesicular trafficking in ClC-2 regulation, we sought to identify proteins that may interact with ClC-2 and serve to mediate or regulate its translocation between the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles. An affinity column bearing purified intact ClC-2 protein was used to capture ClC-2-binding proteins. Recombinant rat ClC-2 protein, engineered to possess a polyhistidine tail at its N terminus, was expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system and purified by metal affinity using the methods described in our previously published work (14Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Huan L.J. Garami E. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13838-13847Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Purified ClC-2 was conjugated to a Hi-Trap column, through which mouse brain homogenate was passed. Brain tissue was used as starting material as ClC-2 is abundantly expressed in this organ (Fig. 1 A). Control experiments were conducted simultaneously using an unconjugated and an amylase-conjugated Hi-Trap column. Interacting proteins were eluted using a pH gradient, and fractions containing the highest levels of protein were pooled, concentrated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Multiple silver-stained bands were detected specifically in the eluant from the ClC-2 affinity column (Fig.1 B). We excised the prominent 100-kDa band for analysis by mass spectrometry. Briefly, a MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprint of the excised band was obtained, and monoisotopic protonated peptide masses were used to search the NCBI sequence databases using PROFOUND. The tentative protein identification as a fragment of DHC subunit was based on the high number of matched peptide masses observed (25% sequence coverage) and low mass error (<0.5 atomic mass unit). The dynein motor complex is comprised of several different polypeptide components; a functional complex is typically composed of two copies of one of the heavy chain subunits, together with multiple copies of intermediate, light intermediate, and light chains (15King S.J. Bonilla M. Rodgers M.E. Schroer T.A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Dissociated heavy chain (isolated from purified bovine brain cytoplasmic dynein) migrates with an apparent molecular mass slightly greater than 200 kDa (15King S.J. Bonilla M. Rodgers M.E. Schroer T.A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, silver stain analysis of the ClC-2 column eluant detects a similarly sized protein. However, commercially available antibodies were not effective in detecting the putative DHC fragment in total brain lysate or in immunoblots of the eluant from the ClC-2 affinity, possibly because of digestion of the antibody epitope. Recent experiments conducted by King et al. (15King S.J. Bonilla M. Rodgers M.E. Schroer T.A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) report unstable DHC-containing subcomplexes generated from potassium iodide-treated purified bovine dynein, which was attributed to a loss in stability conferred by interactions with DIC and dynein light chain subunits. In fact, SDS-PAGE analysis of the DHC-containing complex revealed several distinct bands with molecular masses of slightly greater than 100 kDa (15King S.J. Bonilla M. Rodgers M.E. Schroer T.A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that fragmentation of DHC may have occurred in our ClC-2 column because of a loss in stabilizing contacts with other dynein subunits during gradient pH elution. We reasoned that other subunits of the dynein motor complex may have been specifically eluted as multiple silver-stained bands were seen in Fig. 1 B. Indeed, immunoblotting revealed the presence of DIC specifically in the ClC-2 column eluant (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, DIC migrates as a 75–80-kDa protein, and inspection of the silver-stained gel in Fig.1 B reveals the presence of a protein of this mass. Thesein vitro findings suggest that ClC-2 protein can interact (directly or indirectly) with the multi-subunit dynein motor complex. To determine whether the interaction between ClC-2 and dynein exists in vivo, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using rat hippocampal membranes and polyclonal antibodies directed against the N or the C terminus of ClC-2 or pre-immune IgG as a control. As with the N-terminal antibody (Nt-ClC-2; see Fig. 1 A), the C-terminal-directed antibody (Ct-ClC-2) is specific as Western blotting of membranes prepared from murine brain tissue reveals a single band that migrates at 97 kDa that is absent in the ClC-2 knock-out sample (generated by Melvin and co-workers (4Nehrke K. Arreola J. Nguyen H.V. Pilato J. Richardson L. Okunade G. Baggs R. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23604-23611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); see Fig.2 C). Crude hippocampal membranes were prepared, and immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 plus 0.05% SDS as described under “Materials and Methods.” Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed using our ClC-2 antibody directed against the N terminus. Similar levels of ClC-2 can be immunoprecipitated with both anti-ClC-2 antibodies (Fig. 2 A). As expected, the nonspecific antibody (i.e. preimmune IgG) did not immunoprecipitate ClC-2. Co-precipitation of dynein with ClC-2 was assessed by probing the immunoprecipitates described above with anti-dynein (IC) antibody. Dynein IC could be detected in immunoprecipitates using our Ct-ClC-2 but not in immunoprecipitates using nonspecific IgG (n = 3) or our Nt-ClC-2 (n = 1) (Fig. 2 B). These findings suggest that the ClC-2 interacts with the dynein motor protein complex in vivo and implicate the N terminus of ClC-2 in mediating this interaction. The biochemical assays described in the preceding sections suggest an interaction between ClC-2 and the dynein motor complex. In the following studies, we assessed the functional significance of this interaction in the COS7 fibroblasts as this cell line endogenously expresses ClC-2 and can be readily transfected. Confocal micrographs of ClC-2-specific immunofluorescence in COS7 cells revealed a predominant perinuclear staining pattern with a fainter signal detected close to the cell surface (Fig. 3 A, indicated by arrowheads). Electron micrographs of immunogold-labeled ClC-2 support our claim that ClC-2 localizes to the plasma membrane of COS7 cells (Fig. 3 B). Further confirmation of the presence of ClC-2 at the cell surface was achieved using cell surface biotinylation. Intact COS7 fibroblasts were incubated with sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido) ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate to selectively label cell surface-associated proteins. To ensure that biotin had not labeled intracellular protein, we also assessed biotinylation of the abundant intracellular protein, actin.

Chem. 275, 19224–19230), it was demonstrated that the regulators CbbR and RegA (PrrA) interacted with both promoter proximal and promoter distal regions of the form I (cbbI ) promoter operon specifying genes of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. To determine how these regulators interact with the form II (cbbII ) promoter, threecbbFII::lacZtranslational fusion plasmids were constructed containing various lengths of sequence 5′ to the cbbII operon ofR. sphaeroides CAC. Expression of β-galactosidase was monitored under a variety of growth conditions in both the parental strain and knock-out strains that contain mutations that affect synthesis of CbbR and RegA. The binding sites for both CbbR and RegA were determined by DNase I footprinting. A region of thecbbII promoter from +38 to −227 bp contained a CbbR binding site and conferred low level regulatedcbbII expression. The region from −227 to −1025 bp contained six RegA binding sites and conferred enhancedcbbII expression under all growth conditions. Unlike the cbbI operon, the region between −227 and −545 bp that contains one RegA binding site, was responsible for the majority of the observed enhancement. Both RegA and CbbR were required for maximal cbbII expression. Two potentially novel and specific cbbII promoter-binding proteins that did not interact with thecbbI promoter region were detected in crude extracts of R. sphaeroides. These results, combined with the observation that chemoautotrophic expression of thecbbI operon is RegA independent, indicated that the mechanisms controlling cbbI andcbbII operon expression during chemoautotrophic growth are quite different. In a previous study (Dubbs, J. M., Bird, T. H., Bauer, C. E., and Tabita, F. R. (2000)J. Biol.

Calvin-Benson-Bassham ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase The nonsulphur purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroidesutilizes the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB)1 reductive pentose cycle as its primary pathway for CO2 fixation. In this metabolically diverse organism the CBB cycle plays two very different roles. Under autotrophic growth conditions, CO2 serves as the sole carbon source, and the CBB cycle is the primary source for nearly all of the fixed carbon utilized by the cell. This may entail aerobic chemoautotrophic growth in the dark (i.e. in a minimal medium lacking organic carbon under an atmosphere of 5% CO2/45% H2/50% air) or anaerobic photoautotrophic growth in the light (i.e. in a minimal medium bubbled with 1.5% CO2/98.5% H2). Photoheterotrophic growth in the presence of a fixed carbon source causes the role of the CBB cycle to shift, such that CO2serves primarily as an electron sink, with excess reducing equivalents generated by the oxidation of fixed carbon compounds funneled to CO2 (1Tabita F.R. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 885-914Google Scholar). When grown under conditions where the CBB cycle is required, R. sphaeroides maintains the appropriate level of CBB cycle activity through the coordinate expression of two CBB cycle operons, denoted cbbI andcbbII (2Gibson J.L. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 1107-1124Google Scholar, 3Gibson J.L. Tabita F.R. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to structural genes that encode CBB cycle enzymes, each operon encodes one of two distinct forms of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). The cbbI operon contains the genes for a form I (L8S8) Rubisco (cbbLIcbbSI ) (4Gibson J.L. Falcone D.L. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14646-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whereas the cbbII operon encodes the large subunit of a form II type Rubisco (cbbMII ) (5Chen J.-H. Gibson J.L. Macue L.A. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20447-20452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of cbb gene expression in R. sphaeroides is quite complex (2Gibson J.L. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 1107-1124Google Scholar). Expression of the genes in both the cbbI and cbbII operons is highly induced during anaerobic phototrophic growth and moderately induced during aerobic chemoautotrophic growth (6Paoli G.C. Tabita F.R. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). During growth under CO2 fixing conditions, expression of each operon is modulated independently in response to a number of environmental parameters such as the level of CO2 and the reduction state of organic carbon compounds supplied for growth (7Falcone D.A. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2099-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gibson J.L. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 132: 818-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hallenbeck P.L. Lerchen R.

This independent regulation results in shifts in the relative abundance of proteins encoded within each operon. In general, growth under photoheterotrophic conditions, with a fixed (organic) carbon source, results in an excess of cbbII expression over cbbI. Maximal expression from both operons is observed under photoautotrophic and chemoautotrophic conditions;i.e. when CO2 is used as the sole carbon source, with cbbI operon expression exceeding that for the cbbII operon (11Jouanneau Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 620-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the apparent independent regulation of cbbI andcbbII gene expression, a mechanism for interdependent regulation also exists that results in a compensatory increase in the expression of one operon when the other is inactivated (4Gibson J.L. Falcone D.L. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14646-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Falcone D.A. Tabita F.R. J.

Lerchen R. Hessler P. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1749-1761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cbbR gene, which encodes a LysR-type transcriptional regulator, is located immediately upstream and divergently transcribed from cbbFI (12Gibson J.L. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5778-5784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mediates this compensatory effect. CbbR is a positive regulator of the expression of both the cbbI andcbbII operons (12Gibson J.L. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5778-5784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regA-regB(prrA-prrB) two component regulatory system, encoding sensor kinase RegB (PrrB) and response regulator RegA (PrrA) also plays a role in cbb regulation. Although originally identified as a regulator of photosystem biosynthesis genes in both Rhodobacter capsulatus (14Inoue K. Kouadio J.L. Mosley C.S. Bauer C.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Mosley C.S. Suzuki J.Y. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7566-7573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and R. sphaeroides (16Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), theregA-regB (prrA-prrB) two-component regulatory system was implicated in cbb regulation by genetic studies that demonstrated that a R. sphaeroides regB insertion mutant exhibited reduced cbbI andcbbII expression during photoautotrophic growth in a 1.5% CO2/98.5% H2 atmosphere (17Qian Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 12-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that regA is required forcbbI and cbbII expression during incubation under photoautotrophic growth conditions (18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that RegA binds directly to cbboperon promoters in both R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides (18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Vichivanives P. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1079-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A growing number of studies have shown that the regA-regB (prrA-prrB) two-component system and its homologs regulate the expression of genes involved in a wide variety of metabolic processes such as nitrogen fixation and nitrogen metabolism (20Joshi H.M.

Biol. 1998; 280: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).The overall goal of our ongoing investigation is to understand the mechanism(s) involved in the regulation of cbb gene expression in R. sphaeroides. Prior to this work, the primary model system for our cbb gene regulation studies was the R. sphaeroides cbbI operon. Previous studies, using cbbI::lacZpromoter fusions showed that the cbbI promoter contains a promoter proximal region (−100 to +1 bp) that confers low level regulated expression of cbbI that is CbbR-dependent (13Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNaseI footprinting studies showed that this region contained a binding site for CbbR (−10 to −70 bp), along with two RegA binding sites (−61 to −110) (18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A promoter distal upstream activating region was also identified, between −280 and −636 bp, that significantly enhanced cbbI expression under all growth conditions tested. This region was found to contain two RegA binding sites (−301 to −415 bp) (18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although earlier work determined that the cbbII promoter occurred within 1000 bp of the cbbII transcription start (25Xu H.H. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7299-7308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), details of the structure of the R. sphaeroides cbbII promoter have not been investigated previously. In this study,cbbII ::lacZtranslational fusions with different amounts of upstream sequence were constructed to facilitate monitoring of gene expression under a variety of growth conditions. Evidence for upstream activating sequences was obtained within the cbbII promoter region, and DNaseI footprint analyses enabled binding sites for both CbbR and RegA to be identified within the cbbII promoter region. An important byproduct of these studies was the demonstration that two potentially novel and specific cbbII promoter-binding proteins were present in cell extracts of R. sphaeroides. The results of this investigation indicated that the structure of the R. sphaeroides cbbII promoter exhibited both similarities and differences to the R. sphaeroides cbbI promoter (18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with consequent effects on differential regulation of the cbb operons.DISCUSSIONThis investigation and previous studies (13Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) indicate that theR. sphaeroides cbbI andcbbII promoters have similar structural features. Both promoters are composed of a promoter proximal regulatory region, containing a CbbR binding site sufficient to confer low level regulated cbb expression; in addition, a more distal upstream activating region, containing RegA binding sites, enhances expression. Although each upstream activating region contains multiple RegA binding sites, a single site in each operon (located at −301 bp in cbbI and −282 bp incbbII ) is responsible for the majority of this activation suggesting that both of these sites function similarly during cbb activation. The placement of the CbbR and RegA binding sites and the involvement of upstream sequences in regulated expression of the cbbII operon is summarized (Fig. 6). Not surprisingly the regulation of the cbbII operon mirrored that of thecbbI operon with low expression during aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth and high expression during phototrophic growth. Maximal cbb expression during phototrophic growth has been shown to be dependent on cbbR, as well asreg (12Gibson J.L. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5778-5784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus far, the involvement of upstream activating sequences appears to be unique to R. sphaeroidesas such sequences are not involved with the regulation of thecbbI and cbbII operons of the related organism R. capsulatus (19Vichivanives P. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1079-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The discovery that maximal aerobic chemoautotrophic expression ofcbbII required regA was unexpected, given that chemoautotrophic expression of cbbI is regA-independent (34Gibson J.L. Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6654-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This indicates that molecular mechanisms involved with regulating the two operons are quite distinct under this growth condition. Although the nature of the different chemoautotrophic regulatory mechanisms is not known, the need for different control mechanisms may stem from the fact that O2serves as a terminal electron acceptor during chemoautotrophic growth. Previously, it was shown that the action of the Reg/Prr two-component system of R. sphaeroides may be mediated by electron flow through a cbb3-type terminal cytochrome oxidase, because inactivation of the operon (ccoNOPQ) that encodes this oxidase resulted in aberrant regA-dependent activation of photopigment gene expression under aerobic growth conditions (35O, Gara J.P. Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4044-4050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that during chemoautotrophic growth electron flow to O2 via the cbb3-oxidase may dampen the Reg/Prr-mediated activation of cbb gene expression to the extent that RegA activation alone would produce an insufficient level of CBB cycle enzymes to support optimal growth. The fact that the cbbII promoter is expressed at reduced levels during chemoautotrophic growth relative to photoautotrophic growth is consistent with this idea. An inability to support high level cbb expression might necessitate the recruitment of an additional positive regulatory system(s). The most probable target for chemoautotrophic up-regulation would be thecbbI operon, because it encodes the form I (L8S8) Rubisco, used as the major autotrophic enzyme in the CBB pathway (1Tabita F.R. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 885-914Google Scholar). However, form II Rubisco and enzymes encoded by the cbbII operon allow the CBB pathway to play a somewhat more specialized role such that CO2 may be employed as a terminal electron acceptor (11Jouanneau Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 620-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, retaining Reg/Prr control over cbbII gene expression during chemoautotrophic growth may give R. sphaeroides an enhanced ability to regulate redox poise when growing at the expense of highly reduced electron donors (i.e. molecular H2).Additional regulators may also affect cbbII expression during aerobic chemoautotrophic growth. In a regAbackground, the level of chemoautotrophic cbbII expression from the promoter proximal regulatory region (pVKCIIXcm) was significantly higher than that in parental strain CAC. This increase incbbII expression in the regA mutant could be because of either activation by CbbR or additionalcbbII -specific regulatory proteins whose expression may or may not be affected by regA. The detection of two cbbII promoter-binding proteins, X and Y, in extracts of R. sphaeroides grown both chemoautotrophically and photoautotrophically, provided direct evidence for additional cbbII -specific proteins that bind physiologically significant regulatory sequences. Although proteins X and Y have not yet been identified, binding cannot be attributed to RegA because of the fact that these proteins were present in extracts of a R. sphaeroides regA strain. Moreover, protein X was detected in extracts of photoheterotrophically grown R. sphaeroides cbbR mutant strain 1312.In conclusion, despite the involvement of similar upstream activation sequences, it is clear that distinct molecular mechanisms serve to regulate gene expression of the two major cbb operons ofR. sphaeroides. Moreover, it is apparent that the global two-component Reg/Prr system is only selectively involved withcbb control, with Reg/Prr required to activate transcription of only the cbbII operon, and not thecbbI operon under aerobic chemoautotrophic growth conditions. Future studies will focus on further elucidating regulatory mechanism(s) involved in cbb activation that are both distinct and common to both operons, as well as identifying and determining the role of recently discovered proteins that bind specifically to the cbbII promoter. The nonsulphur purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroidesutilizes the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB)1 reductive pentose cycle as its primary pathway for CO2 fixation. In this metabolically diverse organism the CBB cycle plays two very different roles.

Microbiol. 1996; 166: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to structural genes that encode CBB cycle enzymes, each operon encodes one of two distinct forms of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). The cbbI operon contains the genes for a form I (L8S8) Rubisco (cbbLIcbbSI ) (4Gibson J.L. Falcone D.L. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14646-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whereas the cbbII operon encodes the large subunit of a form II type Rubisco (cbbMII ) (5Chen J.-H. Gibson J.L. Macue L.A.

Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 12-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that regA is required forcbbI and cbbII expression during incubation under photoautotrophic growth conditions (18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that RegA binds directly to cbboperon promoters in both R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides (18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol.

A growing number of studies have shown that the regA-regB (prrA-prrB) two-component system and its homologs regulate the expression of genes involved in a wide variety of metabolic processes such as nitrogen fixation and nitrogen metabolism (20Joshi H.M.

Biol. 1998; 280: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The overall goal of our ongoing investigation is to understand the mechanism(s) involved in the regulation of cbb gene expression in R. sphaeroides. Prior to this work, the primary model system for our cbb gene regulation studies was the R. sphaeroides cbbI operon. Previous studies, using cbbI::lacZpromoter fusions showed that the cbbI promoter contains a promoter proximal region (−100 to +1 bp) that confers low level regulated expression of cbbI that is CbbR-dependent (13Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNaseI footprinting studies showed that this region contained a binding site for CbbR (−10 to −70 bp), along with two RegA binding sites (−61 to −110) (18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A promoter distal upstream activating region was also identified, between −280 and −636 bp, that significantly enhanced cbbI expression under all growth conditions tested. This region was found to contain two RegA binding sites (−301 to −415 bp) (18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although earlier work determined that the cbbII promoter occurred within 1000 bp of the cbbII transcription start (25Xu H.H. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7299-7308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), details of the structure of the R. sphaeroides cbbII promoter have not been investigated previously. In this study,cbbII ::lacZtranslational fusions with different amounts of upstream sequence were constructed to facilitate monitoring of gene expression under a variety of growth conditions. Evidence for upstream activating sequences was obtained within the cbbII promoter region, and DNaseI footprint analyses enabled binding sites for both CbbR and RegA to be identified within the cbbII promoter region. An important byproduct of these studies was the demonstration that two potentially novel and specific cbbII promoter-binding proteins were present in cell extracts of R. sphaeroides. The results of this investigation indicated that the structure of the R. sphaeroides cbbII promoter exhibited both similarities and differences to the R. sphaeroides cbbI promoter (18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with consequent effects on differential regulation of the cbb operons. DISCUSSIONThis investigation and previous studies (13Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) indicate that theR. sphaeroides cbbI andcbbII promoters have similar structural features. Both promoters are composed of a promoter proximal regulatory region, containing a CbbR binding site sufficient to confer low level regulated cbb expression; in addition, a more distal upstream activating region, containing RegA binding sites, enhances expression. Although each upstream activating region contains multiple RegA binding sites, a single site in each operon (located at −301 bp in cbbI and −282 bp incbbII ) is responsible for the majority of this activation suggesting that both of these sites function similarly during cbb activation. The placement of the CbbR and RegA binding sites and the involvement of upstream sequences in regulated expression of the cbbII operon is summarized (Fig. 6). Not surprisingly the regulation of the cbbII operon mirrored that of thecbbI operon with low expression during aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth and high expression during phototrophic growth. Maximal cbb expression during phototrophic growth has been shown to be dependent on cbbR, as well asreg (12Gibson J.L. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5778-5784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19224-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus far, the involvement of upstream activating sequences appears to be unique to R. sphaeroidesas such sequences are not involved with the regulation of thecbbI and cbbII operons of the related organism R. capsulatus (19Vichivanives P. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1079-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The discovery that maximal aerobic chemoautotrophic expression ofcbbII required regA was unexpected, given that chemoautotrophic expression of cbbI is regA-independent (34Gibson J.L. Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6654-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This indicates that molecular mechanisms involved with regulating the two operons are quite distinct under this growth condition. Although the nature of the different chemoautotrophic regulatory mechanisms is not known, the need for different control mechanisms may stem from the fact that O2serves as a terminal electron acceptor during chemoautotrophic growth. Previously, it was shown that the action of the Reg/Prr two-component system of R. sphaeroides may be mediated by electron flow through a cbb3-type terminal cytochrome oxidase, because inactivation of the operon (ccoNOPQ) that encodes this oxidase resulted in aberrant regA-dependent activation of photopigment gene expression under aerobic growth conditions (35O, Gara J.P. Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4044-4050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that during chemoautotrophic growth electron flow to O2 via the cbb3-oxidase may dampen the Reg/Prr-mediated activation of cbb gene expression to the extent that RegA activation alone would produce an insufficient level of CBB cycle enzymes to support optimal growth. The fact that the cbbII promoter is expressed at reduced levels during chemoautotrophic growth relative to photoautotrophic growth is consistent with this idea. An inability to support high level cbb expression might necessitate the recruitment of an additional positive regulatory system(s). The most probable target for chemoautotrophic up-regulation would be thecbbI operon, because it encodes the form I (L8S8) Rubisco, used as the major autotrophic enzyme in the CBB pathway (1Tabita F.R. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 885-914Google Scholar). However, form II Rubisco and enzymes encoded by the cbbII operon allow the CBB pathway to play a somewhat more specialized role such that CO2 may be employed as a terminal electron acceptor (11Jouanneau Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 620-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, retaining Reg/Prr control over cbbII gene expression during chemoautotrophic growth may give R. sphaeroides an enhanced ability to regulate redox poise when growing at the expense of highly reduced electron donors (i.e. molecular H2).Additional regulators may also affect cbbII expression during aerobic chemoautotrophic growth. In a regAbackground, the level of chemoautotrophic cbbII expression from the promoter proximal regulatory region (pVKCIIXcm) was significantly higher than that in parental strain CAC. This increase incbbII expression in the regA mutant could be because of either activation by CbbR or additionalcbbII -specific regulatory proteins whose expression may or may not be affected by regA. The detection of two cbbII promoter-binding proteins, X and Y, in extracts of R. sphaeroides grown both chemoautotrophically and photoautotrophically, provided direct evidence for additional cbbII -specific proteins that bind physiologically significant regulatory sequences. Although proteins X and Y have not yet been identified, binding cannot be attributed to RegA because of the fact that these proteins were present in extracts of a R. sphaeroides regA strain. Moreover, protein X was detected in extracts of photoheterotrophically grown R. sphaeroides cbbR mutant strain 1312.In conclusion, despite the involvement of similar upstream activation sequences, it is clear that distinct molecular mechanisms serve to regulate gene expression of the two major cbb operons ofR. sphaeroides. Moreover, it is apparent that the global two-component Reg/Prr system is only selectively involved withcbb control, with Reg/Prr required to activate transcription of only the cbbII operon, and not thecbbI operon under aerobic chemoautotrophic growth conditions. Future studies will focus on further elucidating regulatory mechanism(s) involved in cbb activation that are both distinct and common to both operons, as well as identifying and determining the role of recently discovered proteins that bind specifically to the cbbII promoter. This investigation and previous studies (13Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dubbs J.M. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. Tabita F.R. J. Biol.

Homologous ssDNA-binding proteins like RPA that are essential for cell viability have been found in all eukaryotic species investigated to date. RPA is one of the key players in various essential processes of DNA metabolism including the initiation and elongation of DNA replication, nucleotide and base excision repair, and homologous recombination (reviewed in Refs. 1Iftode C.

A total of three DNA-binding sites are now distinguished in this subunit, which are referred to as the DNA-binding domains A–C (DBD-A, DBD-B, and DBD-C, respectively) (5Brill S.J. Bastin-Shanower S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7225-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A fourth DNA-binding domain, domain D (DBD-D), resides in the RPA32 subunit (6Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The interaction of RPA with various ssDNA substrates has been investigated in detail. Several ssDNA-binding modes were observed and characterized both biochemically and structurally (reviewed in Refs.1Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Grosse F. Weisshart K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 41-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the first mode RPA binds to ssDNA with an occluded binding site of 8–10 nucleotides (nt) in a cooperative manner with low affinity. A second one is characterized by high affinity binding, an occluded binding site of 30 nucleotides, and a low cooperativity (10Blackwell L.J. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2058-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It has now become an accepted view that RPA binds to ssDNA in a multistep pathway (6Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36446-36453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Bochkareva E. Belegu V. Korolev S. Bochkarev A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22630-22637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The first step involves the cooperative binding to DNA by DBD-A and DBD-B and corresponds to the less stable “8-nt” binding mode. On a gapped template binding is performed in a 5′ → 3′ direction that determines the overall polarity of RPA (16Kolpashchikov D.M. Khodyreva S.N. Khlimankov D.Y. Wold M.S. Favre A. Lavrik O.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The following steps include the successive 3′-directed DNA binding of DBD-C adjacent to DBD-B and of DBD-D adjacent to DBD-C resulting in the stable “30-nt” binding mode (6Bastin-Shanower S.A.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). All these transitions are accompanied by changes in the conformation of the RPA heterotrimer as has been revealed by electron microscopy and limited proteolysis (11Blackwell L.J. Borowiec J.A.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Among the different DNA structures partial DNA duplexes are mimickingin vivo intermediates that occur during DNA replication and DNA repair (3Nasheuer H.P. Smith R. Bauerschmidt C. Grosse F. Weisshart K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 41-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Sugasawa K. Weterings E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H.

Because these structures are more complex than exclusive ssDNA templates, it is the central question how RPA interacts with these DNA structures. In previous reports, photoaffinity labeling studies using DNA duplexes with 5′-protruding ends suggested that binding of RPA subunits is dependent on the template configuration, and the protein:DNA ratio. RPA70 subunit binds to the single-stranded part of the DNA duplex, whereas the RPA32 subunit is located near 3′-end of the primer (19Lavrik O.I. Kolpashchikov D.M. Nasheuer H.P. Weisshart K. Favre A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4235-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These studies were confirmed in vivo by investigating replicating SV40 minichromosomes. Depending on the extent of primer elongation, both subunits were photocross-linked to the 3′-end of the growing primer (20Mass G. Nethanel T. Kaufmann G. Mol. Cell.

In this report we have investigated conformational changes, which accompany the binding of RPA to partial DNA duplexes and assigned protein domains playing important roles in such interactions. Recombinant human DNA polymerase औ (pol औ) was purified as described previously (23Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). RPA was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as outlined elsewhere (24Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol.

Sequencing grade modified trypsin (17400 units/mg) was purchased from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). The 10-kDa protein ladder and prestained molecular mass markers were from Invitrogen and from Sigma, respectively. The RPA70-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies 70A, 70B, and 70C have been described elsewhere (26Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7693-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat monoclonal antibodies directed against the C terminus of RPA70 (RAC-1 and RAC-4) as well as RPA32 (RBF-7) were produced according to standard procedures (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Secondary horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany) and Promega. The ECL chemiluminescence kit for immunoblotting was fromAmersham Biosciences; 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrates for immunoblotting were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Abteilung Biochemie (Institut für Molekulare Biotechnologie, Jena, Germany). The photoreactive nucleotide analogs NAB-4-dUTP (28Wlassoff W.A. Dobrikov M.I.

The designations and sequences of hairpin oligonucleotides are as follows (underlined is the palindrome part of the hairpin, which were designed according to Ref. 18de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E.

The partial duplex system is as follows: PT32, 5′-(T)32AGTGTTATAGCCCCTACC-3′ and 3′-ACAATATCGGGGATGG-5′. The deoxyoligonucleotides d(AT4), d(AT8), d(AT16), and d(AT32) were used to compare ssDNAs and partial duplex DNAs. Primer of the partial duplex system was annealed to the template at a molar ratio of 1:1 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, by heating the mixture at 95 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooling it down to room temperature. Hairpins were self-annealed in the same manner. 5 ॖg of RPA was treated at 37 °C with the indicated amount of trypsin (2.5–100 ng) in a reaction mixture (10 ॖl) containing 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 1 mmEDTA, 70 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT. Where indicated a DNA hairpin (HP-T0, HP-T4, HP-T8, HP-T16, or HP-T32) was present in concentrations equimolar to that of RPA. After 20 min of incubation, reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 15 min. The proteolyzed products were separated by 147 SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 staining, immunoblotting, and automated N-terminal sequencing. Molecular masses of the products were determined on the basis of their electrophoretic mobility using protein molecular mass markers as a reference. Protein samples were separated by 147 SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. RPA subunits and proteolytic fragments were detected using monoclonal antibodies to RPA70 and RPA32, respectively. Secondary antibody conjugates, ECL detection, and bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium detection kits were used according to the manufacturer's protocols. Protein samples were separated by 147 SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The protein bands of interest were excised, and the first 8–10 N-terminal amino acids were determined using a Procise 494 HT Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). The “WinPep” software (30Hennig L. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 1170-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the polypeptides of RPA70 and RPA32 derived from limited proteolysis and characterized by N-terminal sequencing and SDS-gel electrophoresis. The protein sequences of RPA70 and RPA32 were obtained from the Swiss-Prot protein Sequence Database (entries RFA1-HUMAN, P27694, and RFA2-HUMAN, P15927). Primers were 3′-end-labeled at 37 °C in a reaction mixture (300 ॖl) containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.32 ॖm pol औ, 0.54 ॖm partial duplex DNA PT32, 1 ॖCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and 2.5 ॖmunlabeled dCTP. After 5 min of incubation photoreactive NAB-4-dUTP or 4-S-TTP was added at a final concentration of 5 ॖm, and the mixture was further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by heating the mixture for 5 min at 95 °C and rapidly cooling down on ice for 5 min. After such a treatment denatured pol औ was precipitated and removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Resulting mixtures were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and cooled down slowly to room temperature to allow the radioactively labeled photoreactive primer to reanneal to the template strand. RPA was labeled with a photoreactive primer in a reaction mixture (200 ॖl) containing 50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 ॖm radioactively labeled photoreactive partial duplex DNA, and 0.5 ॖm RPA. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, placed in micro-Eppendorf tubes on ice, and irradiated through the open top for 10 min using the Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) equipped with lamps producing UV light of 312 nm. After cross-linking EDTA, MgCl2, and DTT were added to final concentrations of 1, 70, and 10 mm, respectively. Partial proteolysis of the samples was started by adding trypsin (17,400 units/ॖg) to a trypsin:RPA weight ratio of 1:250 and subsequent incubation at 37 °C. Aliquots (20 ॖl) of the reaction mixture were quenched with Laemmli loading buffer at the indicated times and boiled for 15 min. Photochemically cross-linked and partially digested protein-DNA samples were separated by 13.57 SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with silver (31Nasheuer H.-P. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8981-8988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Swain M. Ross N.W. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 948-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), dried, and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak Biomax, Sigma) or quantified using the PhosphorImager Storm 860 (Amersham Biosciences). In a previous report (17Gomes X.V. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) limited proteolysis was used to analyze the protein conformation and to determine structural domains of RPA. It was shown that the heterotrimer undergoes a significant conformational change upon binding to extended ssDNA regions. We have used the same technique to address the question of whether the binding of RPA to partial DNA duplexes (DNA hairpins) containing 5′-protruding ends shows some peculiarities in comparison to the binding of ssDNA. Proteolysis was performed using trypsin as a protease and RPA being either free in solution, bound to ssDNA or DNA-hairpins with ssDNA template strands of various lengths. As shown earlier (17Gomes X.V. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), digestion of RPA by trypsin results in a limited number of distinct fragments. In our experiments we have made titrations of RPA with increasing amounts of the protease. As can be seen in Fig. 1 the proteolytic pattern in this case was almost identical to that obtained when free RPA was digested with a fixed amount of protease for increasing times (17Gomes X.V. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In some instances it was not possible to resolve fragments from each other during denaturing one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Therefore, sometimes single Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained band contained two distinct peptides (Fig. 1; peptides designated “1” and “2,”RPA32, and “6,” as well as “9a” and “9b”) that could be distinguished by region-specific antibodies. Several tryptic peptides have not been identified previously, so we employed immunoblotting and automated Edman sequencing to map precisely the origins of the products. We used five different monoclonal antibodies directed against RPA70 that recognize different parts of the subunit. 70A and 70B bind within the first 173 amino acids (aa), which cover the N-terminal part and some of the following interdomain linker. 70C interacts with the region of amino acids 174–330, which compose the central domain of the 70-kDa subunit. RAC-1 and RAC-4 are both antibodies specific for the C-terminal domain of RPA70 and recognize regions spanning amino acids 441–525 and 525–616, respectively (Fig.2 and data not shown). In addition, N-terminal sequences of the proteolytic fragments were determined. The polypeptides were then identified by calculation using WinPep software (30Hennig L. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 1170-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and selecting the polypeptides with the best matches to the experimentally obtained data, molecular masses, N-terminal sequences, and antibody reactivities. The results of the peptide mapping are summarized in Table I and in Fig. 3. (A more detailed explanation of the proteolytic degradations is presented in the Supplemental Material Figs. S1–14.

As was shown earlier, major cleavage sites are located in the linker between the N-terminal domain (NTD70) and DBD-A after Lys-167 and Lys-163, dividing RPA70 into peptides designated “3,” “10,” and “11” (Figs. 1,4A, and 5A) (17Gomes X.V. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, additionally determined fragments indicate that this site is not the only one accessible during this initial stage of degradation. The cleavage sites after Lys-367, Arg-390, and Lys-354, which are all located within the DBD-B (Figs. 1 and 4A), lead to the peptides “5a,” “8,” and 6, respectively, which are present in small amounts. A minor cleavage site after Lys-431, which lies in the linker between DBD-B and DBD-C, creates peptides “4” and 9a, and the tryptic digestion after Arg-489 and Lys-473 within DBD-C yields the minor proteolytic fragments 1 and 2. This number of exposed sites and available proteolytic pathways explain in part the high rate of RPA70 degradation (Fig. 5A). The relatively large tryptic peptides 3 and 5a are proteolyzed further utilizing the latter cleavage sites. The kinetics of digestion suggests that product 3 is further degraded within the DBD-B region giving rise to fragments 8, 9a, or 9b. Peptide 5a seems to be cleaved in the region of the interdomain linker into fragment 10 and further to 11, which contain the N-terminal part of the RPA70 subunit. Peptides 8 and 6 are further reduced to the C-terminal DBD-C-containing fragment 9a.Figure 5Digestion pathways of RPA70 by trypsin in the absence and in the presence of partial DNA hairpins with extended 5′-protruding tails.A depicts the digestion pathway of RPA70 by trypsin in the absence of DNA and B in the presence of DNA hairpins with extended 5′-protruding tails. Each barrepresents a peptide with structural domains shown in gray, and unstructured linkers are shown in white(NTD70, N-terminal domain of RPA70; DBD,DNA-binding domain). The designation of each peptide is shown on theleft of the bar. Arrows indicate positions of available tryptic cleavage sites for each peptide. The most common cleavage sites are indicated by black, the least frequent ones are marked by white arrowheads, and those with intermediate accessibility are marked in gray arrowheads. Peptides that are the products of a specific cleavage event are shown next to the arrow representing this cleavage. For some peptides we have omitted the schematic bar and put the fragment name instead. The asterisk in Aindicates the cleavage site that is sensitive to the addition of DNA hairpins even with a single 5′-prominent nucleotide. The double asterisks in B identify those cleavage sites that are only sensitive to DNA hairpins with long (17 and 33 nucleotides) protruding ssDNA tails.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In accordance with earlier published data, RPA32 is degraded primarily because of the potential cleavage at the Lys-38 which removes the N-terminal part and gives rise to fragment 7 (Figs. 1 and4A) (8Bochkareva E.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This product is further cleaved at Arg-180 so that the proteolytically stable core of RPA32, peptide “12,” is obtained (data not shown). 2E. Bochkareva and A. Bochkarev, unpublished results. The addition of equimolar amounts of partial DNA-hairpins to RPA changed the pattern of the RPA70 subunit proteolysis (Figs. 4, A–F, and 5; summarized in Table I; a detailed description of the proteolytic degradations is given in the Supplemental Material (Figs. S1–14); Figs. S8–12 show an extensive comparison of the changes in the polypeptide pattern in the presence of partial duplex DNAs). As in the case of ssDNA, the presence of partial DNA hairpins in the reaction mixture leads to a decrease of the proteolytic sensitivity of RPA70 (17Gomes X.V. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The access to cleavage sites might be blocked either by the bound DNA or by changes of the RPA conformation that are induced upon DNA binding. When we used a partial DNA hairpin with only a single 5′-prominent nucleotide (HP-T0) the access to the initial cleavage sites within the DBD-B and the linker between DBD-B and DBD-C were greatly reduced as indicated by the significantly lower amounts of fragment pairs 5a and 8, 4 and 9a, as well as fragment 6 (Fig. 4, A and B; groups of arrows “a,” for explanations see Table I and Figs. 3 and 5). The same initial cleavage sites seems to be completely blocked in the presence of a hairpin with a 9-nt ssDNA tail (HP-T8) (Fig. 4D and Supplemental Material Figs. S8–12).

Oxidation of bovine lipid extract surfactant (BLES), a therapeutic surfactant, with hypochlorous acid (H-BLES) or the Fenton reaction (F-BLES) led to temporary increases in conjugated dienes and formation of malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed the appearance of lipid hydroperoxides, peroxides, lysophospholipids, and free fatty acids. Captive bubble tensiometer studies of H-BLES demonstrated prolonged adsorption times, film instability at low surface tensions during film compression, and reduced respreadability during film expansion. F-BLES exhibited prolonged adsorption times, a marked effect on increasing compressibility during compression, and a lesser effect on reducing respreadability on expansion. Addition of native bovine or rat surfactant-associated protein A (SP-A) reversed the effects of oxidation on surfactant biophysical properties. Studies using mutant recombinant rat SP-As indicated that an intact carbohydrate recognition domain and disulfide-dependent oligomeric assembly are critical for these effects, but the collagen-like region is not required. We conclude that SP-A can reverse the detrimental effects of surfactant oxidation on the biophysical properties of surfactant, by a mechanism that is dependent on interchain disulfide bond formation and the C-terminal domains of the protein.

Through its ability to generate very low tensions during expiration, surfactant stabilizes the alveoli at low lung volumes and limits transudation of interstitial fluid into the airspaces.

Although surfactant is resistant, to some extent, to oxidation because of the predominance of saturated PL (∼30–45% DPPC), unsaturated PLs represent ∼55–70% of the weight of surfactant, including ∼12% with two or more double bonds (8Veldhuizen R. Nag K. Orgeig S. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 90-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 9Yu S. Harding P.G. Smith N. Possmayer F. Lipids. 1983; 18: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Whereas unsaturated PL species are essential to the fluidity of surfactant, the initial formation of the surface film, and the reincorporation of material into the film during expansion in the breathing cycle (1Keough K.M.W. Rooney S.A. Lung Surfactant: Cellular and Molecular Processing. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1998: 1-27Google Scholar, 2Possmayer F. Polin R.A. Fox W.W. Fetal and Neonatal Physiology. W. B.

Surfactant oxidation and dysfunction likely contributes to the pathophysiology of several diseases including adult respiratory distress syndrome (10Gunther A. Siebert C. Schmidt R. Ziegler S.

In addition to direct effects on the surface properties of surfactant, lipid peroxidation products can inhibit the synthesis and secretion of new surfactant (14Warburton D. Buckley S. Cosico L. Forman H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L217-L220PubMed Google Scholar) and reduce the viability of alveolar macrophages, and type II pneumocytes (15Uhlson C. Harrison K. Allen C.B. Ahmad S.

Toxicol. 2002; 15: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).In vitro studies indicate that the most abundant surfactant-associated protein, SP-A, facilitates the surface tension-lowering properties of surfactant PLs (16Rodriguez-Capote K. Nag K. Schurch S. Possmayer F. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 281: L231-L242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cockshutt A.M. Weitz J. Possmayer F.

Lipids. 1990; 52: 243-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although not yet clearly delineated in vivo, these studies suggest that SP-A may enhance surfactant function in vivo under stress conditions associated with lung injury and proteinaceous pulmonary edema.The structural domains of SP-A required for surface tension lowering effects have been mapped by targeted mutagenesis, which has revealed the importance of intact oligomeric assembly and the PL binding function of the COOH-terminal domains. The supraquaternary structure of SP-A consists of six trimeric subunits. Each monomer has four distinct domains: a short NH2-terminal domain containing one or two cysteines that function to stabilize the octadecamer by forming disulfide bonds between trimers; a collagen-like domain, a neck region, and a globular C-terminal domain. The collagen and neck portions of the monomers combine as triple helices to form trimers, and six trimers associate to form an octadecameric “flower bouquet-like” structure that resembles C1q, the first component of complement. The COOH-terminal domain contains both a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), and an overlapping PL binding domain (4McCormack F.X. Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 20McCormack F.X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).In the present study we hypothesized that SP-A may restore the surface-active ability of surfactant inactivated through oxidation. The effects of SP-A and mutant recombinant SP-As on the biophysical function of bovine lipid extract surfactant (BLES) were tested in the captive bubble tensiometer (CBT) before and after oxidation with Fenton chemistry or hypochlorous acid. Our results demonstrated that oxidative modification of surfactant results in loss of surface properties that can be restored to preoxidation levels by the addition of SP-A, through a mechanism that requires the carbohydrate-recognition domain and intact oligomeric assembly.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—All reagents were purchased from Sigma and/or VWR/Canlab unless otherwise noted. BLES was a kind gift of BLES Biochemicals, Inc., London, Ontario, Canada. BLES for these studies contained 80.1 ± 1.53% PC, 0.9 ± 0.12% lyso-PC, 13.2 ± 1.17% PG, 2.7 ± 0.37% PE, 0.9 ± 0.25% PI, 0.2 ± 0.09% phosphatidylserine, and 1.5 ± 0.22% sphingomyelin (n = 3).In Vitro Oxidation—Reaction mixtures composed of 10 mg/ml surfactant lipids, plus Fenton reagents, HOCl/–OCl or controls in buffer A (0.150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Tris-HCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) were incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for 24 h. Hypochlorous acid was purchased as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl, 10–13%) from Sigma. Hypochlorite concentration was determined spectrophotometrically immediately before use by diluting the NaOCl stock solution 1:10 in 1 m NaOH and applying a molar extinction coefficient for pH 12 of 43.6 mol–1 cm–1 at 240 nm. Treatment with HOCl/–OCl was carried out at a final concentration of 0.5 mm at pH 7.4. Because hypochlorous acid hasapKa of 7.46, the term HOCl/–OCl used in this paper represents the mixture of hypochlorite and its corresponding free acid. For oxidation by the Fenton reaction, BLES was incubated with 0.65 mm FeCl2, 0.65 mm sodium EDTA, and 30 mm H2O2 in buffer A. These conditions approximate those used by a number of other investigators who conclude that they represent high physiological ranges (21Amirkhanian J.D. Merritt T.A. Lung. 1998; 176: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Andersson S. Kheiter A. Merritt T.A. Lung. 1999; 177: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Merritt T.A. Amirkhanian J.D. Helbock H. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Biochemical Analysis—Conjugated dienes formed during oxidation were measured via spectrophotometric monitoring of the absorbance at 235 nm (A235) after exposure to HOCl/–OCl or Fenton reagents, as above. Aliquots of the oxidized BLES were diluted to 0.25 mg/ml surfactant and A235 determined every 10 min for 5.5 h against a buffer blank. Data are expressed as the changes in UV absorbance at 235 nm across time. The lipid peroxide content of the surfactant formed during oxidation was measured by using a lipid peroxidation assay kit BIOXYTECHTM LPO-586 (OXIS International, Inc.), which is based on the formation of a colored adduct that absorbs at A586, from the reaction of a chromogenic reagent with either malondialdehyde (MDA) and/or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). Data are expressed as nanomoles of MDA and HNE/mg of surfactant PLs.Mass Spectroscopy—Molecular species of surfactant PLs were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) with a triple quadrupole ESI-MS (model PI 365, Sciex Co., Concord, ON, Canada) using positive mode for PCs and negative mode for PGs employing a slight modification of the method of Postle et al. (13Wright S.M. Hockey P.M. Enhorning G. Strong P. Reid K.B. Holgate S.T. Djukanovic R. Postle A.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Postle A.D.

Briefly, the surfactant lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) by the method of Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar). The lower chloroform layers were dried under N2 and the samples were stored in choroform: methanol (1:1, v/v). Dimyristoyl-PC and dimyristoyl-PG (10 μg, 10:1), from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL), were added as internal standards to aliquots of each surfactant preparation containing ∼80 μg of surfactant. Samples were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in 0.5 ml of methanol:chloroform (2:1, v/v) containing 5 mm NaOH. PC molecular species were detected as sodiated adducts under positive conditions, (M + Na)+, whereas PG and PI molecular species were detected as their molecular ions under negative conditions, (M – H)–. Spectra were obtained by signal averaging (typically 50 scans, 1 min) and processed by use of software supplied by the manufacturer.SP-A—Bovine SP-A was extracted from natural pulmonary surfactant and purified by chromatography on mannose columns as previously described by Cockshutt et al. (17Cockshutt A.M. Weitz J. Possmayer F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8424-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Protein purity was tested by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) under reducing conditions. Rat SP-A was isolated from surfactant obtained from rats exposed to silica, using chromatography on mannose-Sepharose 6B columns. The various rat recombinant SP-As (rSP-A) were prepared as previously described (26McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Wild-type recombinant SP-A (wt rec) lacks proline hydroxylation as it is produced in insect cells. The recombinant SP-AΔN1-P80 (ΔN1-P80) lacking the NH2-terminal and collagen-like regions, is trimeric (31McCormack F.X. Damodarasamy M. Elhalwagi B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3173-3181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The rSP-AΔG8-P80 (ΔG8-P80) is a collagen deletion mutant containing the NH2 terminus, the neck region, and the CRD (29McCormack F.X. Pattanajitvilai S. Stewart J. Possmayer F. Inchley K. Voelker D.R.

The mutant rSP-Ahyp-C6S (C6S), which has Cys6 replaced by a serine, forms trimers but not larger oligomeric forms (29McCormack F.X. Pattanajitvilai S. Stewart J. Possmayer F. Inchley K. Voelker D.R.

The two CRD mutant proteins, rSP-Ahyp-E195A (E195A) and rSP-Ahyp-D215A (D215A), bear point mutations in amino acids predicted to contribute to coordination of a calcium ion involved in PL and carbohydrate binding (28McCormack F.X. Stewart J. Voelker D.R. Damodarasamy M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13963-13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although these SP-As have reduced ligand binding, they are isolated by mannose chromatography and consequently retain some carbohydrate binding activity (Fig. 1).Captive Bubble Tensiometry—CBT assays were performed in triplicate, using 0.05 mg/ml samples diluted in buffer (0.150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Tris-HCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2). The effect of SP-A was tested by adding natural bovine or recombinant rat SP-A at 5% (w/w) relative to surfactant phospholipids. Samples were incubated in a shaking water bath for 1 h prior to measurements. All the experiments were performed at 37 °C except those involving the recombinant rat SP-As because the lack of hydroxyprolines makes these proteins less stable at temperatures above 30 °C (32Ikegami M. Elhalwagi B.M. Palaniyar N. Dienger K. Korfhagen T. Whitsett J.A. McCormack F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38542-38548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33McCormack F.X. Pediatr. Pathol. Mol. Med. 2001; 20: 293-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore the effect of the recombinant SP-As was studied at 25 °C.After filling the CBT chamber with a suspension of the desired surfactant in buffer, an air bubble, 5–8 mm diameter, was introduced. The change in bubble shape was recorded to monitor the adsorption of the surface-active materials to the air-saline interface. After (γeq, mN/m) was attained, the chamber was sealed, and quasi-static or dynamic compression-expansion cycles were performed. Changes in bubble area were recorded during each individual experiment and the bubble shapes analyzed using custom designed software to calculate the surface tension of the film (34Schurch S. Bachofen H. Goerke J. Possmayer F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1989; 67: 2389-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 35Schurch S. Green F.H. Bachofen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 180-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).For quasi-static experiments, the film was allowed to adsorb to γeq before cycling. Quasi-static compression-expansion curves were generated by increasing the pressure in the sample chamber by slowly turning the plunger 5–10° to generate ∼10% changes in bubble volume per step, and allowing 10 s for equilibration after each step. Five quasi-static cycles were conducted with an inter-cycle delay of 1.5 min on return to the original volume. Minimum surface tension (γmin) was established either as the lowest γ attainable without bubble clicking (observed as an instantaneous change to a small surface area with a higher γ) or γ near 1.0 mN/m. In the case of F-BLES, compression was discontinued at ∼50% of the original surface area to avoid breaking the chamber by the high hydrostatic pressure.For dynamic cycling, the surfactant was allowed to adsorb to near γeq. A quasi-static compression-expansion cycle was conducted to establish the surface area reduction required to attain γmin. Dynamic modes were implemented by cycling the bubble between 100 and 110% of the original surface area and the area required to achieve γmin at 30 cycles per minute.The compressibility (C) and respreadibility (R) of the film at a desired γ were calculated using {C/R(γ) = 1/A (δA/δγ)} for the compression or expansion curve, respectively, where A is surface area and δA/δγ is the slope at a desired γ. C refers to the ability of the film to reduce γ during surface area reduction. C = 1.0 indicates no reduction in γ during compression. R refers to the ability of the film to maintain low γs during surface area expansion. This property represents the elasticity of the film, plus the insertion or reinsertion of phospholipid molecules into the expanding film. Insertion occurs through adsorption while reinsertion occurs from the surface-associated surfactant reservoir (2Possmayer F. Polin R.A. Fox W.W. Fetal and Neonatal Physiology. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, PA2003Google Scholar, 36Schurch S. Qanbar R. Bachofen H. Possmayer F. Biol. Neonate. 1995; 67: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). R = 1.0 would indicate no increase in γ during expansion. For samples unable to reach surface tension values ≤10 mN/m, γ at 10 mN/m was obtained by extrapolation of the curve.Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three times with individual freshly prepared samples. Standard error of the mean was obtained from samples of n = 3 or greater. Statistical comparisons were conducted using SPSS Inc. (Chicago, IL) software. Comparisons between two groups were made using paired Student's t test and comparisons between larger groups were conducted by analysis of variants followed by a Tukey post-hoc test. Probability values below 0.05 are considered significant.RESULTSEffect of Free Radical Exposure on Surfactant Phospholipids—Both hypochlorous acid and the Fenton reaction were effective in oxidizing BLES, as shown by increased primary (conjugated dienes, Fig. 2A) and secondary lipoperoxidation products (MDA and HNE, Fig. 2B). The conjugated dienes formed during oxidation (Fig. 2A) were monitored by reading the absorbance at 235 nm after the exposure of BLES to oxidation. In the absence of oxidants (closed circles), in the presence of Fe2+/EDTA (closed triangles) or H2O2 (open circles) small, similar increases in A235 were observed that remained relatively constant over the 2-h period shown in Fig. 2A. The levels did not change further over the remaining 3.5 h of the experiment (data not shown). In the presence of HOCl/–OCl 0.5 mm (closed squares) and the Fenton reagents (FeCl2:EDTA: H2O2, 0.65:0.65:30 mm, open triangles), A235 increased rapidly, reaching maximal levels at 20–30 min, after which it declined. Higher differences in A235 were evident with the Fenton reaction compared with hypochlorous acid. Differences between the oxidation reactions and the control incubations disappeared at ∼60 min for BLES:HOCl/–OCl and ∼90 min for BLES:Fenton. The decrease in absorbance, observed between 90 and 100 min, is consistent with the consumption of the susceptible unsaturated fatty acids and the production of secondary products.Fig. 2Primary and secondary lipoperoxides.A, the conjugated dienes formed during oxidation were monitored, by reading the absorbance at 235 nm after the exposure of BLES at 0.25 mg/ml to oxidation (n = 3). Control samples included: BLES in the absence of oxidants (•) and in the presence of Fe2+/EDTA (▾) and H2O2 (○). Experimental samples included: BLES in the presence of HOCl/–OCl 0.5 mm (▪) and the Fenton reagents (FeCl2:EDTA:H2O2, 0.65:0.65:30 mm ▿). B, the secondary peroxidation products formed during oxidation were measured after 24 h of incubation as the content of MDA and HNE in the surfactant sample. The Fenton reaction, which acts through generation of reactive hydroxyl radical, produced 4.5-fold and the reaction with HOCl/–OCl generated 2.0-fold MDA and HNE than was present in the BLES control (BLES versus BLES:HOCl/–OCL, p < 0.001, BLES versus BLES:Fenton, p < 0.001; n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The secondary peroxidation products formed during oxidation were measured after 24 h incubation as the content of MDA and HNE in the surfactant sample (Fig. 2B). The Fenton reaction, which acts through generation of reactive hydroxyl radicals (37Eberhardt M.K. Reactive Oxygen Metabolites: Chemistry and Medical Consequences. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2000Crossref Google Scholar), generated 4.5 times more MDA and HNE than the control while there was a 2.0-fold increase after reaction with HOCl/–OCl. These results are in overall agreement with the kinetic analysis of the conjugated diene formation (Fig. 2A), where the increased absorbance produced by the Fenton reaction on BLES was approximately double H-BLES and triple the BLES control (BLES versus F-BLES p < 0.001, BLES versus H-BLES p < 0.001). These findings are consistent with and expand on previously published results reporting elevations in primary (conjugated dienes) and secondary lipid peroxidation products (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) after incubation of various surfactants with in vitro reactive oxygen species generating systems (21Amirkhanian J.D.

The lipid profile for BLES PLs before oxidation (Mass spectra, Fig. 3A) was typical of previous reports on lung surfactant (6Postle A.D. Heeley E.L. Wilton D.C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr.

The spectrum is clearly dominated by diacyl-PCs detected as sodiated adducts (M + 22)+, with DPPC (m/z 256) being the major component. The presence of the quaternary ammonia group in PC results in highly efficient detection.

Receptor clusterization is the result of highly regulated processes involving functional and structural proteins. Among the structural elements, microtubules are known to play a crucial role in anchoring of γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptors. Here we show that microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole induces the declusterization of GABAA receptors and modifies the kinetic properties of GABAergic currents in cultured hippocampal neurons. In particular, this drug, applied either in the bath or via the patch pipette, induced the acceleration of the onset kinetics of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) without significantly affecting their frequency, thus suggesting a main postsynaptic site of action. After nocodazole treatment, current responses to ultrafast applications of GABA exhibited a faster rise time and an accelerated onset of desensitization. A quantitative analysis of GABA-evoked currents and model simulations suggest that declusterization affects the gating properties of GABAAreceptors. In particular, a faster entry into the desensitized state of declustered GABAA receptors may account for the changes in the kinetic properties of mIPSCs after nocodazole treatment. Hence it appears that the clustered condition of GABAA receptors contributes in shaping GABAergic currents.

To form and maintain postsynaptic clusters, neurons must possess the ability to appropriately sort, target, cluster, recycle, and degrade GABAA receptors (1Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Rev.

Neurochem. 2000; 75: 644-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and interaction with the γ2 subunit of GABAA receptors (4Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), but it also bindsN-ethylmalemide sensitive factor, a protein that plays an essential role in intracellular membrane trafficking (6Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). The possible role of GABAA receptor-associated protein in GABAA receptors trafficking is strengthened by its sequence and structural similarities with mammals and yeast proteins involved in membrane dynamics and vesicular transport (7Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 8Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J.

Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 39: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After the insertion into the plasma membrane, GABAAreceptors may undergo clusterization. One of the major candidate molecules for synaptic GABAA receptor clustering is gephyrin (11Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9289-9297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a tubulin-binding protein that has been shown to co-localize with GABAA receptors at postsynaptic sites (15Sassoe-Pognetto M. Kirsch J. Grunert U. Greferath U. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. Betz H. Wassle H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 357: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, additional proteins must be involved in the clustering process (3Kneussel M. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 39: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), because biochemical approaches failed to show a direct interaction between gephyrin and GABAA receptors (16Kannenberg K. Sieghart W. Reuter H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An increasing body of evidence indicates that the cytoskeleton is essential for clustering GABAA receptors (4Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 17Whatley V.J. Mihic S.J. Allan A.M. McQuilkin S.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol.

The cytoskeleton is formed by a complex meshwork of microtubules, actin microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and many associated proteins. The state of polymerization of microtubules appears to contribute in modulating the activity of GABAA receptors (17Whatley V.J. Mihic S.J. Allan A.M. McQuilkin S.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19546-19552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Meyer D.K. Olenik C. Hofmann F. Barth H. Leemhuis J. Brunig I. Aktories K. Norenberg W. J.

The disruption of microtubules with colchicine, vinblastine, and nocodazole has been shown to block muscimol-stimulated36Cl− uptake into cortical microsacs and to inhibit GABA-mediated currents in Xenopus laevisoocytes expressing GABAA receptor subunits (17Whatley V.J. Mihic S.J. Allan A.M. McQuilkin S.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19546-19552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in cultured hippocampal neurons nocodazole treatment induced a rundown of muscimol-induced currents (18Meyer D.K. Olenik C. Hofmann F. Barth H. Leemhuis J. Brunig I. Aktories K. Norenberg W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6743-6751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the efforts to clarify the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating cytoskeleton-receptor interactions, this topic is still a matter of debate. In particular, it is unknown whether receptor clusterization may interfere with the gating properties of GABAA receptors. In this study we induced the depolymerization of microtubules with nocodazole to alter the organization of GABAA receptor clusters in cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that declusterization of GABAA receptors was associated with an acceleration of the rise time of mIPSCs. Moreover, in diffuse GABAA receptors, current responses to ultrafast applications of GABA showed a faster onset and an accelerated desensitization. Model simulations suggested that the increased rate of entry into the desensitized state might account for the accelerated onset kinetics of GABAergic currents. Primary cell cultures were prepared as previously described (21Andjus P.R. Stevic-Marinkovic Z. Cherubini E. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2- to 4-day-old (P2–P4) Wistar rats were decapitated after being anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of urethane (2 mg/kg). This procedure is in accordance with the regulation of the Italian Animal Welfare Act and was approved by the local veterinary service authority. Hippocampus were dissected free, sliced, and digested with trypsin, mechanically triturated, centrifuged twice at 40 × g, plated in Petri dishes, and cultured for up to 14 days. Experiments were performed on cells cultured for at least 7 days. Nocodazole (purchased from Sigma, Milano, Italy) was used to disrupt microtubules. It was applied at the concentration of 10 μg/ml (22Bueno O.F. Leidenheimer N.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) from a 100% Me2SO stock solution. The final concentration of Me2SO in the working solutions was 0.1% (v/v). Nocodazole was applied in two different ways: in the culture medium (bath treatment) and via the patch pipette (intrapipette application). Bath treatment consisted of adding the drug to the neuronal culture medium and incubating the cells at 37 °C for 2 h. Because the effects of nocodazole are reversible, in electrophysiological experiments the drug was added to the extracellular and intracellular solutions (10 μg/ml). To verify whether Me2SO itself could affect synaptic transmission, some electrophysiological experiments (n = 12) were performed also on cells incubated with Me2SO alone in the culture medium at 37 °C for 2 h. Me2SO 0.1% (v/v) did not produce any change in the kinetic properties of mIPSCs. Intrapipette application consisted of adding nocodazole to the intracellular solution to apply the drug only to the recorded cell via the patch pipette (18Meyer D.K. Olenik C. Hofmann F. Barth H. Leemhuis J. Brunig I. Aktories K. Norenberg W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6743-6751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23van Zundert B. Alvarez F.J. Yevenes G.E. Carcamo J.G. Vera J.C. Aguayo L.G. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry for the γ2 subunit of the GABAA receptor was performed to analyze the organization of GABAA receptors on the neuronal membrane both before and after bath treatment with nocodazole as described above. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, hippocampal neurons seeded on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 5% normal serum, and incubated with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against the amino-terminal region of the γ2 subunit (γ2[1–33]R13/7, kindly provided by W. Sieghart, University of Wien, Austria). The resulting immune complex was visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, Milano, Italy). Note that the receptors labeled were only those expressed on the cell surface, because the incubation with the anti-GABAA receptor γ2 subunit antibody was performed on non-permeabilized cells. To evaluate the disruptive effect of nocodazole on the microtubular network, the same hippocampal neurons were then used for a second immunocytochemical experiment using an antibody against tubulin. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 5% normal serum, and incubated with a rat monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody. The resulting immune complexes were visualized with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-rat IgG (Sigma, Milano, Italy). Neurons were imaged with the Olympus (BX51WI) confocal system by using sequential dual-channel recording of double-labeled cells. Currents were recorded in the whole-cell and outside-out configurations of the patch-clamp technique using an EPC-7 amplifier (List Medical, Darmstadt, Germany). In the case of whole-cell recordings, the stability of the patch was checked by repetitively monitoring the input and series resistance during the experiments. Cells exhibiting changed values were excluded from the analysis. The series resistance (R s) was in the range of 4–8 MΩ. Both mIPSCs and GABA-evoked currents were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV. The intrapipette solution contained (in millimolar): CsCl 137, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 2, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N9-tetraacetic acid 11, ATP 2, and HEPES 10, pH 7.2, with CsOH. The composition of the external solution was (in millimolar): NaCl 137, KCl 5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, glucose 20, and HEPES 10, pH 7.4, with NaOH. mIPSCs were recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 μm) and kynurenic acid (1 mm) to block fast sodium spikes and fast glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic events, respectively. To gain a better resolution of the kinetic properties of GABAA receptors, all the electrophysiological experiments have been performed at room temperature (22–24 °C) rather than at physiological temperatures (35 °C). This choice is also justified by the fact that, at higher temperatures, the recordings (particularly in the excised patch mode) are very unstable and therefore not particularly suitable for the kinetic analysis performed in the present experiments. For the analysis requiring a high temporal resolution (e.g. rise time kinetics of synaptic and evoked currents) signals were low pass-filtered at 10 kHz with a Butterworth filter and sampled at 50–100 kHz using the analog-to-digital converter CED 1401 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK) and stored on a computer hard disk. The data and acquisition software were kindly given by Dr. J. Dempster (Strathclyde University, Glasgow, UK). GABA was applied to excised patches using an ultrafast perfusion system based on a piezoelectric-driven theta glass application pipette (24Jonas P. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-Channel Recording. Plenum, New York1995: 231-243Crossref Google Scholar). The piezoelectric translator was from Physik Instrumente (Waldbronn, Germany), and theta glass tubing was from Hilgenberg (Malsfeld, Germany). The time course of the solution exchange was estimated by liquid junction potential measurements. The application of a 10%-diluted external solution to the open tip patch pipette evoked a junctional current. The establishment of this current represents the complete solution exchange around the patch pipette. The 10–90% of this process occurred in 40–80 μs (10–90% solution exchange time). The speed of the solution exchange was also estimated around the excised patch by the 10–90% onset of the membrane depolarization induced by application of high (25 mm) potassium saline. In this case the 10–90% rise time value (60–90 μs) was very close to that found for the open tip recordings. Miniature synaptic currents were analyzed with the AxoGraph 3.5.5 program (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). This program uses a detection algorithm based on a sliding template. The template did not induce any bias in the sampling of events, because it was moved along the data trace one point at a time and was optimally scaled to fit the data at each position. The detection criterion was calculated from the template-scaling factor and from how closely the scaled template fitted the data. The threshold for detection was set at 3.5 times the S.D. of the baseline noise. Using the same program, the decay time constant of averaged mIPSCs was taken from the biexponential fit of the decay time. The rise time was estimated as the time needed for 10–90% increase of the peak current response. The decaying phase of the mIPSCs and GABA-evoked currents was fitted with exponential functions in the form, y(t)=∑i=1nAi*exp(−t/τi)Equation 1 where τi and A i are the time constants and relative fractions of the respective components In the case of analysis of normalized currents, the fractions of kinetic components fulfilled the normalization condition, as in Equation 2. ∑i=1nAi=1Equation 2 Deactivation time courses of mIPSCs and GABA-evoked currents were fitted with a sum of two and three exponentials, respectively (n = 2 and n = 3). The mean time constant calculated as, τmean=∑i=1nAi*τiEquation 3 was used to estimate the speed of the decaying process. In the case of current responses elicited by long (250 ms) GABA pulses, the desensitization onset was described by, y(t)=Afast*exp(−t/τfast)+Aslow*exp(−t/τslow)+AsEquation 4 where A fast andA slow are the fractions of the fast and the slow component, respectively, and τfast and τslow are the fast and the slow time constants.A s is the steady state current. The goodness of the fit was assessed by minimizing the sum of the squared differences. Brief (2 ms) paired pulses separated by a variable time interval were used to test whether or not the entrance of bound receptors into the desensitized state proceeded after the agonist removal. The parameter R was calculated according to the formula, R=(I2−Iend)/(I1−Iend)Equation 5 where I 1 is the first peak amplitude,I end is the current value immediately before the application of the second pulse, and I 2 is the second peak amplitude. During the 2-ms pulse the onset of the use-dependent desensitization is minimal. Thus, in the case of continued entrance into the desensitized state after the first short agonist pulse, the peak of the second response (I 2) was smaller than the first one resulting inR < 1. Simulation experiments were performed using the Bioq software (kindly provided by Dr. H. Parnas, Hebrew University, Jerusalem). The Bioq software converted the kinetic model (see Fig.8 A below) into a set of differential equations and solved them numerically. Because in the absence of agonist receptors can spontaneously open at very low probability (25Birnir B. Everitt A.B. Lim M.S. Gage P.W. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 174: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Birnir B. Eghbali M. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 181: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Bianchi M.T. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9083-9091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for simulation convenience it was assumed as the initial condition,i.e. at t = 0 no bound or open receptors were present. Various experimental protocols were investigated by “clamping” the agonist concentration time course in the form of square-like pulses (ultrafast perfusion experiments). The solution of such equations yielded the time courses of probabilities of all the states assumed in the model. The fit of the experimental data was performed by optimizing the values of rate constants. The procedure for the rate constants optimization was based on the comparison of the time course of recorded currents and that of simulated responses. As described in detail under “Results,” specific experimental protocols were used to estimate different sets of rate constants. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., and all the values included in the statistics represent recordings from separate cells. Unless otherwise stated, statistical comparisons were made with the use of unpaired t test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p < 0.05 was taken as significant). GABAA receptor clusterization is known to be dependent on the presence of the intact cytoskeleton. Nocodazole was tested on cultured hippocampal neurons for its ability to depolymerize microtubules and disrupt the cytoskeleton. Neurons were incubated with nocodazole (10 μg/ml) for 20, 40, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C and then immunostained for tubulin. Progressive disruption of microtubules occurred with the increasing duration of the incubation time. By 40 min most of the microtubules were depolymerized (data not shown). Bath application of nocodazole for 2 h at room temperature and 37 °C produced similar microtubule disruption (n = 4, data not shown), indicating that incubation temperature does not influence nocodazole effect. Then the organization of GABAA receptors in the plasma membrane was analyzed upon nocodazole-induced depolymerization of microtubules. In control conditions, the typical branched microtubule bundles were associated with brightly stained clusters of GABAA receptors on the soma and dendrites (Fig.1, A and B). After nocodazole treatment for 1–2 h, the disassembly of the microtubular network was accompanied by a redistribution of GABAAreceptors, because they were diffusely expressed throughout the surface of the cells or still belonged to residual puncta (Fig. 1, Cand D). These experiments provide evidence that nocodazole is able to depolymerize microtubules and to induce GABAAreceptors declusterization in cultured hippocampal neurons. mIPSCs were recorded from cultured hippocampal neurons in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique at a holding potential of −70 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 μm) and kyneurenic acid (1 mm). Miniature events were reversibly blocked by bicuculline (10 μm) indicating that they were GABAA-mediated (data not shown). mIPSCs were recorded from untreated neurons (control), and cells were incubated for 2 h with nocodazole (10 μg/ml). Nocodazole treatment induced a significant (p < 0.0001) acceleration of the current onset: in control conditions, the mean 10–90% rise time of mIPSCs was 0.96 ± 0.03 ms (n = 35), whereas in cells treated with nocodazole it was 0.72 ± 0.02 ms (n = 29, Fig.2 A). This acceleration resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) shift to the left of the cumulative rise time distribution (Fig. 2 B). Nocodazole treatment did not significantly (p > 0.05) affect the mean frequency of mIPSCs (0.67 ± 0.11 and 0.46 ± 0.10 Hz, in control and nocodazole, respectively, data not shown). Although nocodazole treatment induced a slight reduction of the mean peak amplitude (from 63.2 ± 3.4 to 58.6 ± 4.8 pA), and this difference was not significant (p > 0.05). Moreover, the cumulative amplitude distribution of mIPSCs was not significantly different from control (p > 0.05; Fig. 2 D). The decay of mIPSCs was unaffected by nocodazole: current decay was fitted with a biexponential function with time constants τfast and τslow of 8.0 ± 0.7 and 39.7 ± 1.9 ms (A fast = 0.35) and 6.3 ± 0.8 and 36.4 ± 3.6 ms (A fast = 0.33) in control and in nocodazole treated neurons, respectively (Fig.2 C). This resulted in a mean time constant (τmean) of 28.1 ± 1.2 (control) and 26.1 ± 2.3 ms (nocodazole). Altogether, these results indicate that the declusterization of GABAA receptors subsequent to microtubule disruption accelerates the onset kinetics of mIPSCs. Moreover, the lack of a clear effect of nocodazole on mIPSCs frequency suggests that this drug does not have a main effect on transmitter release. To confirm this hypothesis, further experiments were performed by adding nocodazole into the patch pipette, so as to disrupt microtubules only in the recorded cell. Currents were recorded for at least 50 min to allow nocodazole to produce its effect (as detected from immunocytochemical experiments). mIPSCs recorded in 10-min epochs were pooled together and then analyzed. In control conditions (n = 10) the onset of mIPSCs did not significantly change with time, and no signs of rundown were observed. During intrapipette application of nocodazole (n = 11) a progressive acceleration of mIPSCs onset was observed (Fig.3 A). Compared with controls, in the presence of nocodazole a significant (p < 0.05) reduction of mIPSCs rise time was detected from 30 min on. The linear regression curves through the data points obtained in control and in the presence of nocodazole had almost the same intercept, indicating that, starting from similar conditions, it took some time for nocodazole to produce its effect. If we considered the first 10 min of intrapipette application of nocodazole as internal control, the progressive reduction of the rise time became significant (p < 0.05) after 40 min. The cumulative rise time distribution of the events recorded during the last 10 min was significantly (p < 0.001) shifted to the left compared with that relative to the first 10 min (Fig. 3 B). This result was consistent with the immunocytochemical data showing that it takes less than 40 min for nocodazole to considerably disrupt microtubules and to induce the declusterization of GABAAreceptors. No significant changes (p > 0.05) in the peak amplitude and decay of mIPSCs occurred during intrapipette application of nocodazole. During the first and the last 10-min epochs, the peak amplitude was 58.4 ± 2.7 and 52.5 ± 4.9 pA, respectively, whereas τmean was 28.2 ± 2.3 and 29.9 ± 4.0 ms, respectively (Fig. 3 C). Similarly to the bath treatment, the intrapipette application of nocodazole did not alter the frequency of mIPSCs, because the cumulative interevent interval distributions of mIPSCs recorded at 10 and 50 min were similar (p > 0.05, Fig.3 D). The lack of changes in mIPSCs frequency obtained after bath treatment and during intrapipette application of nocodazole suggests that the main site of action of this drug is postsynaptic. The use of the ultrafast agonist application system allows determination of the microscopic gating of GABAA receptors with a time resolution adequate to synaptic events (28Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 29Mozrzymas J.W. Barberis A. Michalak K. Cherubini E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Barberis A. Cherubini E. Mozrzymas J.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8618-8627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Firstly we have investigated the possible direct effect of nocodazole on the kinetic properties of GABAergic currents. GABA was applied alone or with nocodazole to the same patch excised from untreated neurons (n = 6). The co-application of GABA (10 mm) and nocodazole (10 μg/ml), after a pre-equilibration with nocodazole for 1 min, did not alter the peak amplitude and the kinetic properties of the currents, compared with controls (p > 0.05; Fig.4 A). In particular, in the absence or presence of this drug, the mean 10–90% rise time and the mean peak amplitude values of GABA-evoked responses were similar (312 ± 25 μs and 375 ± 48 pA in control,versus 302 ± 32 μs and 412 ± 74 pA in nocodazole, respectively, n = 6, paired ttest p > 0.05, Fig. 4 A). Single applications of GABA (n = 10) or GABA plus nocodazole (n = 9) were also tested in different patches. Again nocodazole (10 μg/ml) did not induce any modification in the shape of GABA-evoked currents. The 10–90% rise time was 309 ± 15 and 314 ± 19 μs and the peak amplitude was 371 ± 78 and 352 ± 89 pA, in control and co-application of nocodazole, respectively (p > 0.05). Altogether these data demonstrate that nocodazole does not have a direct effect on GABAA receptors. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the changes of mIPSCs kinetics induced by GABAA receptor declusterization, currents evoked by ultrafast applications of GABA were studied with different protocols in patches excised from nocodazole-treated neurons. Similarly to mIPSCs, nocodazole treatment (10 μg/ml, for 2 h) induced an acceleration of the onset of currents evoked by brief (2 ms) pulses of a saturating concentration of GABA (10 mm, Fig.4 B, left). In these conditions, the value of the mean 10–90% rise time of GABA-evoked currents was significantly (p < 0.01) smaller than control (297 ± 9 and 245 ± 8 μs, in control, n = 29, and nocodazole,n = 26, respectively, Fig. 4 B,right). According to the kinetic model proposed by Jones and Westbrook (28Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6431-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the peripheral antenna, Lhc proteins bind a number of xanthophyll species, namely lutein, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin, acting in the harvesting of light and transfer of excitation energy to Chls (3Gradinaru C.C. van Stokkum I.H.M.

Müller M.G. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Holzwarth A.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2517-2532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The photoprotection function of xanthophylls is accomplished through multiple mechanisms including the quenching of Chl a triplet states, scavenging of singlet oxygen produced by the reaction of Chl triplets with O2, and participation to non-photochemical quenching, a mechanism in which violaxanthin is de-epoxidated to zeaxanthin and excess energy is dissipated into heat (7Demmig B. Winter K. Kruger A. Czygan F.-C. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 218-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, xanthophylls are essential for Lhc protein folding (8Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas their binding to a specific allosteric site controls the transition between dissipative and conservative protein conformations (9Moya I. Silvestri M. Vallon O. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 10Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The reason why Lhc proteins require a number of xanthophyll species while reaction center proteins only require β-carotene is not completely understood; these carotenoid species have very similar physico-chemical properties, enabling, in each case, efficient light harvesting, triplet quenching, and singlet oxygen scavenging (11Bassi R. Caffarri S. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 64: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the pigment composition is one of the most conserved traits in higher plants, suggesting a specific function for each carotenoid species. The best known xanthophyll binding protein is the major light harvesting complex of Photosystem II (LHCII) for which four distinct binding sites have been reported to be bound into distinct domains of the protein. Sites L1 and L2 intersect the helix A/helix B cross-domain in the center of the Lhc structure (12Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). L1 is selective for lutein, whereas L2 can also bind violaxanthin (13Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Site N1 is highly selective for neoxanthin and is located within the C helix domain of LHCII (14Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Finally, a low affinity binding site has been named V1 after its major ligand (violaxanthin) in low light conditions (15Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 16Caffarri S. Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35924-35933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Each binding site was shown to play a distinct functional role; structure stabilization and Chl a triplet quenching are provided by lutein in site L1 only (10Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Site V1 is not involved in singlet nor in triplet energy transfer and was suggested to accommodate a pool of readily available substrate molecules for the violaxanthin deepoxydase enzyme (16Caffarri S. Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35924-35933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whose product, zeaxanthin, can then be bound to the allosteric site L2 (18Morosinotto T. Baronio R. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36913-36920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Site N1 is active in light harvesting and singlet oxygen scavenging (13Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and stabilizes the long lifetime conformation of LHCII (19Polivka T. Zigmantas D. Sundström V. Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Despite the high homology in the transmembrane regions, which suggests a similar folding, the number of xanthophyll binding sites, their selectivity, and their occupancy in the structure seem to be different in each Lhc gene product. Considering the different roles of individual sites and the complexity of the Lhc multigene protein family, it is possible that the function of individual Lhc gene products is largely determined by the presence/absence of individual xanthophyll sites and by their selectivity and strength. Primary sequence analysis of structural determinants for xanthophyll binding sites has been less successful than in the case of Chl binding sites, possibly due to the contribution of neighbor Chls rather than of amino acid side chains, to the formation of binding pocket for xanthophylls (13Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 14Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, four short sequences, located in the hydrophilic domains and consisting into four hydrophobic amino acids and a charged residue, could be involved in the binding by forming a hydrophobic pocket hosting xanthophylls end-rings, whereas the charged side chain was supposed to interact with oxygenated ring substituents (20Pichersky E. Jansson S. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1996: 507-521Google Scholar). Alternatively, binding might be performed by interactions between hydrophobic residues with the polyene chain located deeply in the membrane as observed in the bacterial LH2 complex (21McDermott G. Prince S.M. Freer A.A. Papiz M. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A.M. Cogdell R.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 517-521Crossref Scopus (2497) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the results of a detailed analysis of the chlorophyll a/b/xanthophyll protein CP29 (Lhcb4) with respect to the xanthophyll stoichiometry, location, and function as well as of the sequence determinants involved in their interaction with the polypeptide chain. DNA Construction and Mutation of CP29 —CP29-WT and mutants were obtained as reported in Bassi et al. (17Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The chimeric complex was build using two restriction sites, BsshII and SalI, which are present in the nucleotide sequence of Lhcb1 gene of Zea mays. These sites are, respectively, upstream and downstream from the region coding for helix C portion of LHCII apoprotein. The region between these sites was changed with the corresponding sequence of CP29 cloned using two primers (GGGGCGCGCGCCTCGGCGCCCTCTCCGTCGAG and GGGGGGTCGACCGGGTCGAGCTCGGCGTTGCG) in which there are the same restriction sites. In Fig. 1 the sequence of the chimeric complex is presented together with the sequences of LHCII and CP29. The apoproteins were overexpressed and isolated as reported in Bassi et al. (17Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Reconstitution and Purification of CP29-WT, Mutants, and Chimera-Pigment Complexes—Complex reconstitution and purification procedures were performed as described in Giuffra et al. (22Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) but using for CP29 a chlorophyll a/b ratio of 4.5. The chimera was reconstituted in the same conditions using a chlorophyll a/b ratio of 4.5 as CP29 and 2.3 as LHCII and the full carotenoid complement present in the thylakoid membrane. Samples with different carotenoid complement were reconstituted in the same way but with a changed xanthophyll composition in the pigment mixture. Native CP29 was purified from Z. mays as reported in Croce et al. (23Croce R. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11142-11148Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Pigment Analysis—The pigment complement of the holoprotein was analyzed by HPLC (24Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and fitting of the acetone extract with the spectra of the individual pigments (25Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 38: 7334-7343Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy—Absorption spectra were measured by an SLM-Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were obtained using a Jasco-FP-777 spectrofluorimeter. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded at 10 °C with a Jasco 600. Samples were in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.06% β-d-dodecylmaltoside, 20% glycerol. Chlorophyll concentration was ≈10 μg/ml for CD and absorption measurements and 0.01 μg/ml for fluorescence measurements. LD spectra are the same reported in Simonetto et al. (26Simonetto R. Crimi M. Sandona D. Croce R. Cinque G. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12974-12983Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Photobleaching kinetic was measured as described in Formaggio et al. (10Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Stability Measurements—The stability of the complexes was determined after the decrease of the CD signal at 490 nm induced by the temperature. A temperature range between 20 and 80 °C was used. The temperature was changed continuously by 1 °C/min. The thermal stability of the protein was determined by finding the t½ of the signal decay. Data Analysis—Deconvolution of spectra in the Soret (350–550-nm wavelength) range was performed as previously described (27Croce R. Cinque G. Holzwarth A.R. Bassi R. Photosynth. Res. 2000; : 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using a homemade program. Energy transfer efficiency from Cars to Chls was estimated from the ratio of contributions in fluorescence excitation with respect to absorption of individual pigment pools. In all the samples the energy transfer from Chl a was normalized to 100%. The first step of this work consisted into the determination of the number of carotenoids bound to each CP29 polypeptide. To this end, the complex was purified by preparative isoelectrofocalization from Z. mays grana membrane as previously reported (28Dainese P. Hoyer-hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pigments were extracted with 80% acetone, and the absorption spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. The spectra of individual pigments were used for reconstructing the spectrum of the acetone extract from two hypothetical CP29 complexes binding 8 Chls (6 Chl a plus 2 Chl b) (17Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 29Dainese P. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8136-8142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and either 2 or 3 xanthophylls in the ratio shown by HPLC analysis: 0.85 lutein, 0.5 neoxanthin, and 0.65 violaxanthin (30Giuffra E. Zucchelli G. Sandona D. Croce R. Cugini D. Garlaschi F.M. Bassi R. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12984-12993Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The “synthetic” spectra are shown in Fig. 2 together with the experimental spectrum. An almost perfect fit was obtained considering two Cars per polypeptide, whereas the hypothesis of three Cars was discarded. Reconstitution of Recombinant CP29 with Different Xanthophyll Species—Although the Car to polypeptide stoichiometry in CP29 is 2:1, three xanthophyll species were found in the pigment-protein complex, indicating promiscuity of at least one of the binding sites. To investigate the affinity of the binding sites for the different xanthophylls, recombinant CP29 apoprotein, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, was reconstituted in the presence of individual carotenoids or a combination of two. Stable complexes were obtained with all xanthophylls alone except neoxanthin, similar to what was observed in LHCII and CP26 (13Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 25Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 38: 7334-7343Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 31Frank H.A. Das S.K. Bautista J.A. Bruce D. Vasil'ev S. Crimi M. Croce R. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The pigment composition of the reconstituted products was analyzed by HPLC and fitting of the acetone extracts. The results are reported in Table I. All samples showed a Chl/Car ratio around 4.0 implying two xanthophylls per polypeptide. The complex reconstituted with zeaxanthin was the only exception; although a complex with two zeaxanthin molecules per polypeptide was obtained (CP29-Zb) in some experiments, in other preparations a single Zea molecule was found (CP29-Za). Neoxanthin in the complex never exceeded one molecule per polypeptide, suggesting that only one site can accommodate this xanthophyll. Clearly, the occupancy of this site alone could not sustain the folding of the pigment-protein complex.Table IPigment composition and denaturation temperature of complexes reconstituted in the presence of different carotenoidsThe samples were named after the carotenoid species used in the reconstitution mixture (e.g. CP29-L complex reconstituted in the presence of only lutein in the pigment mixture). Data are the average of four independent reconstitution experiments. The errors in the measurements are all less than 0.05. For the denaturation temperature, the error in the measurements is around 2 °C.Sample% in the mixturePigment composition of the complexDen TLNVZChl aChl bLNVZ°CCP29-native620.850.50.65CP29-cont452035620.90.50.5864.0CP29-L1006.11.91.8553.6CP29-V100621.849.1CP29-Za(b)aTwo CP29-Z samples containing different amounts of carotenoids have been obtained, which are called Za and Zb.100621.2 (1.8)a49.1CP29-LN5050621.20.856.5CP29-LV25756.11.90.71.264.9CP29-NV50505.92.10.81.257.8a Two CP29-Z samples containing different amounts of carotenoids have been obtained, which are called Za and Zb. Open table in a new tab Stability—It was previously shown that reconstitution in the absence of carotenoid does not yield into a folded Chl-protein complex (8Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that carotenoids play a primary role in stabilizing Lhc holoproteins. To study the influence of each of the two Car binding sites and of individual xanthophyll species therein in the stabilization of the structure, denaturation experiments were performed. The data are reported in Table I. The control CP29 complex containing lutein, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin had a denaturation temperature of 64 °C. Among the complexes reconstituted in the presence of two xanthophyll species, CP29-LV and CP29-VN were slightly less stable, whereas CP29-LN was somewhat more stable than CP29-control, thus showing that neoxanthin has a stabilizing effect with respect to violaxanthin. Complexes containing only one carotenoid species were the less stable, their denaturation temperature ranging between 53 and 49 °C. Light Harvesting—The absorption spectra of all complexes were recorded at room temperature. The spectra were almost identical in the Qy region, indicating that the binding of different xanthophyll species does not strongly influence the Chl absorption (data not shown). Major differences were observed in the 400–520-nm region, where the Cars directly absorb by their S0-S2 transition (Fig. 3, A–F). In the antenna complexes of higher plants carotenoids have a light-harvesting function. To determine the energy transfer efficiency of individual Cars in the two sites, the absorption spectra of the complexes were described in terms of absorption of individual pigments using two Chl a forms, two Chl b forms, and two Cars forms. Once the best fit was chosen for the absorption spectrum, the same set of data was used to describe the correspondent fluorescence excitation spectrum (Fig. 3, A′–F′). The integrated areas of the pigment bands in the absorption and excitation spectra were used to calculate the efficiencies of the energy transfer in the complex. The error is around 5% assuming for Chl a 100% transfer efficiency. The data are reported in Table II.Table IIEnergy transfer efficiency for individual Cars in different sitesThe absorption wavelength of the red-most peak of the xanthophylls is also reported. All the spectra were described with two carotenoid absorption forms. The transfer efficiency for each of them is reported. The error in the values is within 5%.

Open table in a new tab The overall Car to Chl a energy transfer depends on the xanthophyll composition. Among complexes with a single xanthophyll species, CP29-L was the complex with lowest transfer efficiency (60%), whereas CP29-V had the highest (73%). The two samples reconstituted with zeaxanthin only, had very different energy transfer efficiency: CP29-Za (with a single xanthophyll) showed an efficiency of 62%, whereas for CP29-Zb (with two xanthophylls) this value dropped to 37%, thus indicating that the additional zeaxanthin molecule is unable to transfer energy to Chl a to a significant extent (<5%). When two xanthophyll species were allowed, the highest efficiency was obtained in the case of CP29-VN (81%), the lowest with CP29-LN (69%). In the control CP29 sample, three xanthophyll species were present, with the lutein transferring with 75% efficiency and violaxanthin and neoxanthin with 60–65% (6Croce R. Müller M.G. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Holzwarth A.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2517-2532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Photoprotection—Xanthophylls in Lhc complexes act in quenching 3Chl and scavenging of 1O2, thus providing photoprotection. Photoprotection can be measured from the ability in preventing Chl photobleaching under strong white light illumination in the presence of oxygen (13Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The results of this measurement for the recombinant CP29 complexes are shown in Fig. 4. CP29-control and the complexes with two xanthophyll species show high resistance to photooxidation, whereas complexes with only one xanthophyll species are more sensitive, thus yielding a behavior according to the following series: CTR = LN = LV > V > L > Z. It is interesting to note that violaxanthin is more effective in photoprotection than lutein; it should also be noted that CP29-Za contains a single carotenoid molecule per polypeptide, whereas the CP29-V sample has two. Occupancy of the Xanthophyll Binding Sites: CP29 Versus LHCII—Three tightly bound xanthophyll binding sites have been described in LHCII, sites L1 and L2 (12Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar), accommodating mostly lutein in the native complex, and N1, which is selective for neoxanthin (13Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 14Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The data presented above show that only two of these sites are conserved in CP29. Previous work showed that site L1 is conserved in CP29 (17Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear if either site N1 or L2 is conserved. Alternatively, both sites could be present but only partially occupied. To discriminate between the above hypotheses, a chimeric complex was produced, including the central domain (helices A + B) of LHCII and the C helix domain of CP29. The helix A-helix C lumenal loop and part of the helix C-helix B stromal loop were also included in the swapped domain since the loops can affect Lhc protein folding (32Heinemann B. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14088-14093Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The apoprotein was overexpressed in E. coli, and the complex was reconstituted in vitro with pigments. A pigment-protein complex was obtained, which had the same mobility in a sucrose gradient of CP29 and LHCII monomeric complexes and a denaturation temperature of 66 °C, intermediate between that of CP29 (64 °C) and LHCII (73 °C). The absorption spectrum of the complex along with its second derivative is presented in Fig. 5. The maximum in the Qy region is at 676 nm, whereas a strong Chl a contribution was detected at 666 nm. In the blue region the minima at 495, 468.4, and 437.2 nm in the derivative spectrum were attributed, respectively to Car, Chl b, and Chl a. HPLC pigment analysis showed that the chimeric complex has a Chl a/b ratio of 2.7 when reconstituted in the same condition of LHCII-WT (Chl a/b 2.3 in the mixture) and 4.0 when reconstituted in the condition of CP29-WT (Chl a/b 4.5 in the mixture). The Chl to Car ratio was 4.0, and the xanthophyll species bound were lutein and small amount of violaxanthin. The chimeric LHCII-CP29 complex never binds neoxanthin irrespective of the xanthophyll availability in the pigment mixture and other reconstitution conditions (Table III).Table IIIPigment composition of chimeric complex reconstituted in two different conditionsThe values for LHCII and CP29 reconstituted in the same conditions are also reported. The number after the sample name indicates the Chl a/b ratio in the reconstitution mix used. The data are obtained from the average of two independent experiments showing less than 5% differences in the values.SampleChl a/bChl/CarPigment compositionChl bNVL(mol/100 mol Chl a)Chimera-2.32.74.037.11.43.226.8Chimera-4.54.04.026.31.33.227LHCII-2.31.44.07114325.6CP29-4.53.04.0347.210.115 Open table in a new tab Orientation of Xanthophyll Transition Moments in CP29 — Xanthophylls are bound to the L1 and L2 sites of LHCII, their polyene chain forming an angle of, respectively, 56.4 and 59.4° with respect to the normal to the thylakoid membrane plane (12Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). We have used LD to determine the orientation of xanthophyll transition moments, lying within a few degrees from the plane of the polyene chain (33Dolan P.M. Miller D. Cogdell R.J. Birge R.R. Frank H.A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 12134-12142Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in CP29. To distinguish between the contribution of xanthophylls in sites L1 and L2 to the LD signal, we have used the CP29 mutants E166V and E174V previously shown to have either complete or partial emptiness of site L2 (17Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The major contribution of xanthophylls to the CP29-WT LD spectrum (Fig. 6) appears as a positive signal at 495 nm, whose amplitude is reduced in the E174V mutant and becomes negative in the E166V mutant. This suggests that the xanthophyll bound to the site L1 has its dipole moment transition forming an angle smaller than 54.7° with the normal to the membrane plane. The decreased intensity of the positive signal in CP29-E174V complex confirms that the positive contribution is related to carotenoid in the L2 site. In this case, the angle between the dipole moment transition axis and the normal to the membrane plane is larger than 54.7°. Using an internal standard it is possible to determine the exact values for these angles. In CP29 the orientation of the Chls has been determined from the LD signal after normalization. We therefore analyzed the spectra previously presented in Simonetto et al. (26Simonetto R. Crimi M. Sandona D. Croce R. Cinque G. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12974-12983Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and we calculated the orientation of the Cars transition moments. The orientation of the xanthophyll located in the L1 site was calculated from the spectrum of the E166V mutant in which the only xanthophyll present is located in site L1. The analysis of L2 was performed on the WT - E166V difference spectrum. The spectra were fitted with the absorption spectra of the Cars to calcul"

The hydrophobic amino acids in the core of the subdomain are conserved in a wide range of species, indicating that a similarly structured motif is present at the N terminus of IF2 in many of the bacteria. External to the compact 50-amino acid subdomain, residues 51–97 are less conserved and do not appear to form a regular structure, whereas residues 98–157 form a helix containing a repetitive sequence of mostly hydrophilic amino acids. Nitrogen-15 relaxation rate measurements provide evidence that the first 50 residues form a well ordered subdomain, whereas other regions of Domain I are significantly more mobile. The compact subdomain at the N terminus of IF2 shows structural homology to the tRNA anticodon stem contact fold domains of the methionyl-tRNA and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases, and a similar fold is also found in the B5 domain of the phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase. The results of the present work will provide guidance for the design of future experiments directed toward understanding the functional roles of this widely conserved structural domain within IF2.

In bacteria, translation initiation is promoted by three protein factors: IF1,1 IF2, and IF3. These protein factors are essential in ultimately assembling the 30 S and 50 S subunits of the ribosome, the initiator fMet-tRNAfMet, and the translation initiation region of the mRNA, thereby forming the functional 70 S initiation complex. Bacterial translation initiation factor IF2 ensures correct binding of fMet-tRNAfMet to the P-site of the 30 S ribosomal subunit. Subsequently, the 50 S ribosomal subunit joins the 30 S initiation complex aided by IF2. GTP bound to the factor is hydrolyzed in a ribosome-dependent reaction. IF2 is then released from the ribosome leaving fMet-tRNAfMet in the ribosomal P-site. Recent reviews of the translation initiation process are provided in Refs. 1Ramakrishnan V.

The primary structure of initiation factor IF2 from different organisms can be divided into distinct regions based on interspecies amino acid sequence homology (5Steffensen S.A. Poulsen A.B. Mortensen K.K. Sperling-Petersen H.U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig.1. The C-terminal region of the protein is highly conserved among species. This part has several functions including a binding site for fMet-tRNAfMet, a site for binding and hydrolysis of GTP, and a site for interaction with IF1 (Ref. 6Sørensen H.P. Hedegaard J. Sperling-Petersen H.U. Mortensen K.K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 51: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and references therein). Sequence homologues of IF2 have been found in Archaea and eukaryotes, where the factor is referred to as aIF5B and eIF5B, respectively (7Kyrpides N.C. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). aIF5B and eIF5B have some functional similarity to bacterial IF2; each of these proteins has GTPase activity, and promotes ribosomal subunit joining and probably interaction with Met-tRNAiMet (8Choi S.K.

Dever T.E. Burley S.K. Cell. 2000; 103: 781-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); sequence homology predicts a similar structure for the conserved C terminus of IF2 from bacteria. The structure of the 99-residue Met-tRNAiMet binding domain of IF2 from the bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus has been solved using NMR methods (11Meunier S. Spurio R. Czisch M. Wechselberger R. Guenneugues M. Gualerzi C.O. Boelens R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1918-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). There is, however, no previously reported crystallographic or NMR structural study of Domain I at the N terminus of bacterial IF2 (Fig. 1), which is the subject of the present work. Bacterial IF2 is encoded by the infB gene, which inEscherichia coli encodes three forms of IF2: IF2–1, -2, and -3, of molecular masses 97.3, 79.9, and 78.8 kDa, respectively (12Nyengaard N.R. Mortensen K.K. Lassen S.F. Hershey J.W. Sperling-Petersen H.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1572-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The expression of IF2–2 and IF2–3 in E. coli is by tandem translation of the intact infB mRNA, and not by translation of post-transcriptionally truncated mRNA. Hence, the three different forms of IF2 have identical C termini (13Mortensen K.K. Hajnsdorf E. Regnier P. Sperling-Petersen H.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 1254-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The presence of both the large and smaller forms is required for optimal growth of E. coli. The cellular content of IF2-2 and -3 is close to the level of IF2-1 (14Howe J.G. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1954-1959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sacerdot C. Vachon G. Laalami S. Morel-Deville F. Cenatiempo Y. Grunberg-Manago M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The presence of more than one isoform of IF2 is not a phenomenon peculiar to E. coli, but has been found in several other enterobacteria (16Laursen B.S. Steffensen S.A. Hedegaard J. Moreno J.M. Mortensen K.K. Sperling-Petersen H.U. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of IF2 differs from the C-terminal region in that there is significantly more variability between species in primary structure as well as length. We have previously used sequence data and biochemical experiments to divide the N-terminal region of E. coli IF2 into three separate domains designated Domain I, II, and III (17Mortensen K.K. Kildsgaard J. Moreno J.M. Steffensen S.A. Egebjerg J. Sperling-Petersen H.U. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 46: 1027-1041PubMed Google Scholar), as illustrated in Fig. 1. A function for the domains in the N-terminal region has been demonstrated in E. coli, where a fragment of IF2 consisting of Domains I and II, but not a fragment consisting of Domain I alone, binds to the 30 S ribosomal subunit (18Moreno J.M.

Kristensen J.E. Mortensen K.K. Sperling-Petersen H.U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently used a primer extension inhibition assay to identify Domains I-II of E. coli IF2 as an interaction partner for the infB mRNA (16Laursen B.S. Steffensen S.A. Hedegaard J. Moreno J.M. Mortensen K.K. Sperling-Petersen H.U. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The present work describes the results of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) experiments used to characterize the 18-kDa Domain I of E. coli IF2. A search among structures in the Protein Data Bank revealed that this domain has no significant primary sequence homology to any protein of known structure, and a BLAST search (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59416) Google Scholar) of the non-redundant protein sequence data available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Web site showed that the domain has no significant sequence homologue other than the same domain within IF2 of different species. The fragment of the infB gene encoding the first domain of IF2–1 was amplified by PCR using E. coli K12 as template and primers that included unique restriction sites for XbaI andNdeI for insertion into the pET-15b expression vector (Novagen). DNA sequencing confirmed the insertion of infBinto the vector. The protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). Cells were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the cells reached an OD550 of 0.6. Cells from a 1-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation and dissolved in 20 ml of buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 mm NaN3). The solution was passed once through a French pressure cell at 1500 PSI and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded on a 40-ml SP Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences), and bound protein was eluted with a 0–200 mmNaCl step gradient. The buffer was changed to buffer A using a Sephadex G25 column (Amersham Biosciences). The pooled fraction was passed through a Source 30Q column, and the unbound protein was loaded on a 20-ml SP Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences). The IF2 Domain I was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 200 mm NaCl over 8 column volumes, yielding 40 mg of pure protein per 1 liter of culture medium. The purified protein was subjected to N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation, and the protein mass was determined by MALDI-TOF analysis. Samples of protein enriched in 15N or15N and 13C simultaneously were prepared as described above, but cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 1.5 g/liter [13C] glucose and/or 0.6 g/liter [15N] ammonium chloride (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively. The circular dichroism spectra were recorded on the UV1 photobiology synchrotron beamline at the Institute for Storage Ring Facilities at Aarhus University, Denmark, using synchroton radiation provided by the ASTRID storage ring. Spectra were recorded in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 using an open 0.01-mm Hellwa suprisil quartz cell. The data were acquired using 5 consecutive scans with 1-nm intervals in the range 180–250 nm. Spectra of each sample were recorded from 5 to 70 °C in 5 °C steps. The sample was allowed to equilibrate at each temperature for 20 min before acquiring the spectra. The data were normalized to a 1 mg/ml concentration in a 1-mm path length cell. NMR spectra were recorded at 20, 30, and 40 °C using a 500 MHz Varian Inova spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance probe and z-axis pulsed-field gradient. NMR samples typically contained 2–3 mm of the protein and 10 mm sodium phosphate in 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O solvent at pH 6.0. Backbone resonance assignments were obtained by analyzing HNCA, HNCO, HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, and HACACBCO spectra, which correlate the backbone protons to the N, Ca, Cb, and CO signals of the same and adjacent amino acid residues. 15N-edited HSQC-TOCSY, 13C-edited HCCH-TOCSY, and two-dimensional 2QF-COSY and TOCSY spectra were used for side-chain resonance assignments. NOE cross-peaks were detected using two-dimensional1H-1H NOESY, three-dimensional15N-resolved 1H-1H HSQC-NOE, and three-dimensional 13C-edited 1H-1H HSQC-NOESY spectra. The 13C-edited1H-1H NOE spectrum was collected in 90% H2O/10%D2O solvent, so that NOE peaks between amide and side-chain protons could be resolved by the chemical shift of a side-chain 13C nucleus. Rapidly exchanging amide protons were identified by comparing 15N-1H correlated spectra obtained with selective excitation versuspresaturation for solvent suppression. Data were processed using either the program NMR-Pipe (21Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11443) Google Scholar) or Felix 1.0 (Hare Research). 1H,15N, and 13C chemical shifts are referenced as recommended by Ref. 22Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, with proton chemical shifts referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) at 0 ppm. The 0 ppm 13C and 15N reference frequencies were determined by multiplying the 0 ppm 1H reference by 0.251 449 530 and 0.101 329 118, respectively. Structure calculations for IF2 Domain I were performed using the hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols within the CNS version 1.1 program suite (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were derived from multidimensional NOE spectra. In order to minimize the effects of spin diffusion, as many of the NOE cross-peaks as possible were identified in homonuclear two-dimensional NOE spectra acquired with relatively short mixing times (60 ms); these spectra also offered the best digital resolution. Peaks from these short mixing time spectra were placed into four categories: strong (<3.2 Å), medium (<3.6 Å), weak(< 4.2 Å), and very weak (<4.6 Å). Additional NOE cross-peaks were identified in the three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOE spectra (60-ms mixing time) and assigned to distance restraints as strong (<5.0 Å), medium (<5.5 Å), weak (<6.3 Å), and very weak (<6.9 Å). A very conservative distance restraint of <7.9 Å was used for NOE cross-peaks identified in spectra obtained with a relatively long mixing time (160 ms), where the effects of spin diffusion are most likely to be present. Pseudoatom corrections were included for NOEs including stereospecifically unassigned methyl protons of Val or Leu, where distances were measured from the center of the two methyl groups, and 2.5 Å was added to the interproton distance. For NOEs involving other methyl groups distances were measured from the center of the methyl group, and 1.0 Å was added to the interproton distance. Stereospecifically unassigned methylene groups were treated the same way, and 0.7 Å was added to the interproton distance. For NOEs involving δ and ε protons of Phe, distances were measured from the central point between the two atoms, and 2.4 Å was added to the interproton distance. For regions of regular α-helix or β-strand structure identified by characteristic NOE patterns and chemical shift indices (CSI) (24Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), backbone torsion angle restraints were included for the ϕ and ψ angles. For β-strands, ϕ and ψ angles were restricted to −120o ± 25o and 150o ± 25o, respectively, and for α-helices both ϕ and ψ angles were restricted to −60o ± 25o. Hydrogen bond restraints were only included for amide protons with relatively slow solvent exchange rates that are also located in regions of regular α-helix or β-sheet structure. Twenty diverse starting structures were generated by subjecting a random coil model to the CNS simulated annealing protocol using only the dihedral angle and hydrogen bond constraints. These structures were then used as starting models for 200 runs of the simulated annealing protocol. Most of the simulated annealing runs resulted in similar structures with similar energies. From this final set of refined models, a set of 20 structures were selected that satisfy the following criteria: 1) their CNS energy term is at or very near the minimum value obtained, 2) there are no interproton distance constraint violations of greater than 0.5 Å, 3) the set of models are a fair representation of the full range of structures that satisfy the NMR-derived restraints while having reasonable molecular geometry, as defined by the CNS energy function. Structural statistics (Table I) were calculated with the assistance of the program PROCHECK-NMR (25Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

The 15NT 1 and T 2 relaxation times and the 15N-1H NOE were measured using pulse sequences (26Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar) that feature gradient selection and sensitivity enhancement, and pulses for minimizing saturation of the solvent water. Six two-dimensional spectra with relaxation delays of 10, 260, 510, 760, 1010, and 1260 ms were acquired for the T 1relaxation measurements, and six two-dimensional spectra with relaxation delays of 29, 58, 87, 116, 145, and 174 ms were acquired for the T 2 relaxation measurements; in each case the relaxation delay between the acquisition of each free induction decay was 3 s. The spectra for measuring the15N-1H NOE were acquired with either a 5-s delay between each free induction decay or a 1-s delay followed by a 4-s long series of 120o nonselective 1H pulses. The T 1 and T 2 data were fitted to a single exponential decay function of the form I = I0e−t/Td, in which I is the intensity of the signal at time t, I0 is the intensity at time t = 0 and T dis the decay constant T 1 orT 2, respectively. Rotational correlation times and order parameters were calculated using Modelfree 4.0 (27Lillemoen J. Hoffman D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) as previously described (28Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer III, A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Domain I of E. coli translation initiation factor IF2 was recombinantly expressed, and the purified domain found to be soluble, stable, and well suited for study using biophysical methods. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed that the N-terminal methionine residue was post-translationally removed from the protein. CD spectra contain features typical of a protein with substantial α-helical content (Fig. 2 A), with characteristic minima at 207 and 222 nm. CD spectra recorded at 30 °C or below look essentially the same, whereas spectra recorded at higher temperatures differ significantly, presumably due to unfolding of the protein (Fig. 2 B). The circular dichroism at 207 nm increases with increasing temperature, consistent with a decrease in helical content. The presence of an isodichroic point in the CD spectra indicates that the unfolding is a two-state process. The protein can be reversibly denatured by heating; a sample heated to 70 °C and then cooled to 20 °C has a CD spectrum that is the same as that recorded before heating of the sample. Two-dimensional NMR spectra acquired at 20 and 30 °C are essentially identical and of excellent quality, with the majority of the resonances being well dispersed, as is typical for a folded protein (Fig.3). However, most NOE cross-peaks were absent in spectra acquired at 40 °C. The NMR and CD data are therefore consistent in indicating that the domain starts to lose structure between 30 and 40 °C.Figure 315 N-1H correlated HSMQC spectrum of Domain I of IF2. The spectrum was acquired at 30 °C in 10 mm phosphate at pH 6. Resonance assignments of the most well resolved cross-peaks are labeled. Chemical shift assignments for the domain of IF2 have been submitted to the BioMagResBank and assigned the accession number BMRB-5624.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An abundance of inter-residue NOE cross-peaks were observed for residues 2–50 of Domain I, consistent with these residues forming a compact globular subdomain. In contrast, residues 51–157 only exhibit NOE cross-peaks between pairs of protons that are relatively close together in the primary sequence; these residues are therefore likely to form a linker region connecting the compact folded structure formed by amino acids 2–50 with the other domains of IF2. The structural details of each of these subdomains within Domain I of IF2 will be discussed in turn. A summary of local NOE patterns and CSI, which define the secondary structure of the protein are given in Fig.4. The structure of residues 2–50 at the N terminus of IF2 was determined from distance constraints derived from observed NOE intensities, and torsion angle and hydrogen bond constraints derived for the regions identified as having regular β-sheet or helical structure. Complete backbone and nearly complete side chain chemical shift assignments were obtained for the 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclei in the subdomain. Of particular significance, complete1H resonance assignments were obtained for all of the leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and alanine side chains (among others) in the subdomain; assignment of NOE cross-peaks derived from these side chains were critical in defining the hydrophobic core. A superposition of a set of structures that are equally consistent with more than 900 NMR-derived constraints is shown in Fig.5. These structures are a fair representation of the full range of structures that are consistent with the NMR data. Structural statistics for residues 2–50 are summarized in Table I. Coordinates for the subdomain have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), where it has been assigned accession number 1ND9. The NMR results show that the first 50 amino acids of IF2 form a compact structure consisting of three β-strands and three short α-helices. The three helices are nearly orthogonal, and are located on the same side of an antiparallel twisted sheet formed by three β-strands. Strands β1 (residues 3–6) and β2 (residues 29–32) are linked by helices α1 (residues 8–12) and α2 (residues 16–26), strand β3 (residues 35–39) is connected to β2 by a short loop, and the compact subdomain terminates with helix α3 (residues 42–50). Alignments of IF2 sequences from different species show that hydrophobic residues Ile-6, Leu-9, Val-17, Leu-20, Val-21, Phe-24, Ala-27, Ile-29, Val-37, Leu-45, Ile-46, and Leu-49 are conserved in a wide range of species (Figs. 6 and 7); these residues are all buried and form the core of the subdomain structure. Aribbon diagram depicting the fold of the subdomain is shown in Fig. 5.Figure 7Alignment of the N-terminal 50 amino acids of IF2 in a diverse set of bacteria. The alignment provides evidence that the structure of the 50 amino acid α/β motif at the N terminus of Domain I is well conserved among a wide range of bacterial species. The conserved residues that form the hydrophobic core of the 50 amino acid N-terminal motif are shown in red and indicated withred arrows. Sequences of IF2 were chosen so as to represent a much more divergent set of bacteria than that shown in Fig. 5.E. coli belongs to the γ subdivision of the proteobacteria; Desulfovibrio desulfuricans andGeobacter metallireducens belong to the Δ subdivision of the proteobacteria; Campylobacter jejuni belongs to the ε subdivision of the proteobacteria; B. subtilis, B. stearothermophilus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, andLactococcus lactis are members of the firmicutes;Nostoc punctiforme, Prochlorococcus marinus, Synechocystis, Thermosynechococcus elongatus, and Trichodesmium erythraeum belong to various subdivisions of the cyanobacteria; Deinococcus radiodurans and Thermus thermophilus belong to the thermus/deinococcus group; Thermotoga maritima represents the thermotogae; Chlorobium tepidum represents the chlorobi, and Chlamydia pneumoniae represents the chlamydiae group. Alignment of the conserved hydrophobic residues does not require any gaps except for the single amino acid deletion between residues 35 and 36 in the E. coli sequence; this deletion also occurs in some of the other β and γ proteobacteria (Fig. 6) and is in a loop region of the structure. Although an excellent alignment was found for the first 50 amino acids of IF2 from each species shown, significant similarity was not found for the amino acids in the region corresponding to 51–157 of the E. coli sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In previous work, monoclonal antibodies were generated against IF2 fromE. coli (17Mortensen K.K.

One of these antibodies was epitope mapped on native full-length IF2 to the region of β2-β3 and the loop connecting these strands, suggesting that this region may be solvent-exposed in the full-length IF2; however, we note that epitope mapping is not an unambiguous indicator of solvent-exposed residues. The coordinates for the structure of the IF2 N-terminal subdomain were compared against a data base of known structures using the Vector Alignment Search Tool (VAST), located at the NCBI Web page, and the DALI search tools (29Holm L.

In addition, many chemotherapeutic agents are potent pro-oxidative stressors. Although the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) is synthesized in response to oxidative stress, and many epidermal carcinomas express PAF receptors, it is not known whether PAF is involved in chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis. These studies examined the role of the PAF system in chemotherapy-mediated cytotoxicity using model systems created by retroviral mediated transduction of the PAF receptor-negative human epidermal carcinoma cell line KB with the human PAF receptor (PAF-R) and ablation of the endogenous PAF-R in the carcinoma cell line HaCaT with a retroviral mediated inducible antisense PAF-R vector. The presence of the PAF-R in these models resulted in an augmentation of apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and mitomycin C but not by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or by C2 ceramide. Oxidative stress and the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) are found to be involved in this augmentative effect because it was blocked by antioxidants and inhibition of the NF-κB pathway using a super-repressor form of inhibitor B. These studies provide evidence for a novel pathway whereby the epidermal PAF-R can augment chemotherapy-induced apoptotic effects through an NF-κB-dependent process.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a fundamental physiological process enabling the removal of damaged or infected cells and the control of cell populations (1Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4145) Google Scholar). Apoptosis can occur during embryogenesis, induction and maintenance of immune tolerance, development of the nervous system, and endocrine-dependent tissue atrophy (2Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). In addition to normal physiological conditions, essentially all chemotherapeutic agents exert their effects by induction of apoptosis (3Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of apoptosis can have important consequences both during development and in the treatment of cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests platelet-activating factor (PAF1; 1-alkyl-2-acetyl glycerophosphocholine)-mediated pathways are involved in cutaneous inflammation and keratinocyte stress responses. PAF is a glycerophosphocholine-derived lipid mediator implicated in numerous inflammatory processes (for a review, see Ref. 4Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 419-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes synthesize PAF and related 1-acyl-PAF-like species in response to various stimuli including ionophores, growth factors, PAF agonists, the pro-oxidative stressor tert-butyl hydroperoxide, ultraviolet light irradiation, or acute thermal damage (5Michel L.

Res. 2000; 292: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although PAF can be metabolized to other biologically active lipids, the majority of PAF effects appear to be mediated by interaction with a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the PAF receptor (PAF-R) (for a review, see Ref. 10Ishii S. Shimizu T. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 41-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In addition to producing PAF, keratinocytes and many carcinoma cell lines also express the PAF-R (11Travers J.B. Huff J.C. Rola-Plaeszczynski M. Gelfand E.W. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 816-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Activation of the epidermal PAF-R leads to the production and release of PAF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, and eicosanoids (12Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A.

In addition to a tightly coupled enzymatic pathway for PAF synthesis involving the subsequent actions of phospholipase A2 and acetyltransferase, PAF and PAF-like lipids can be produced via direct free radical-mediated cleavage of glycerophosphocholines (GPCs) containing unsaturated fatty acids (e.g. arachidonate) at the sn-2 position (15Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria-Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

Recent studies have suggested that the PAF-R is a target for ultraviolet B radiation in part through this non-enzymatic pathway of PAF agonist formation (7Barber L.A. Spandau D.F. Rathman S.C.

Med. 2002; 195: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For example, the presence of the PAF-R augments the production of cytokines IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α as well as the apoptotic response of ultraviolet B radiation in carcinoma cell lines, processes inhibited by antioxidants (7Barber L.A. Spandau D.F. Rathman S.C. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Hurwitz S.A. Travers J.B. J. Biol.

Inasmuch as other proapoptotic agents including chemotherapeutic agents are also potent pro-oxidative stressors, the objective of these studies was to assess whether the epidermal PAF-R could augment the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents. Using a PAF-R-negative human carcinoma cell line transduced with the PAF-R and a novel retroviral mediated antisense strategy to ablate endogenous PAF-R expression in a PAF-R-positive epithelial carcinoma cell line, we demonstrate that the PAF-R can augment apoptosis due to etoposide and mitomycin C but not other agents such as C2 ceramide and TRAIL. The mechanism of how PAF-R activation could augment chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was also examined in these studies, and it was found to be dependent upon activation of NF-κB proteins, sequence-specific transcription factors induced in response to inflammatory and other stressful stimuli (for a review, see Ref. 17Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Of note, activation of NF-κB has been shown to protect epidermal cells against the apoptotic effects of TRAIL and tumor necrosis factor-α via enhanced expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (18Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Southall M.D. Isenberg J.S.

The stimuli that can induce this antiapoptotic response include IL-1औ, γ interferon, and PAF. Although associated with a protective response in this setting, activation of the NF-κB pathway also has been shown to augment proapoptotic responses (20McInnis J. Wang C. Anastasio N. Hultman M.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The current findings describe a putative mechanism by which this G protein-coupled receptor can augment pro-oxidative and proapoptotic stressors in epithelial cells and could provide a novel pathway by which carcinomas can be more susceptible to chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Recombinant human TRAIL/APO2L was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). IL-1औ was purchased from Peprotek (Rocky Hill, NJ). The human epidermoid cell line KB and human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and were supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). A KB PAF-R model system was created by transduction of PAF-R-negative KB cells with the MSCV2.1 retrovirus encoding the human leukocyte PAF-R as described previously (12Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). KB cells transduced with the PAF-R (KBP) or with control MSCV2.1 retrovirus (KBM) were characterized by Southern and Northern blot analysis and by radioligand binding and calcium mobilization studies to demonstrate that the PAF-R was functional (12Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, to create a KB cell line expressing the fMLP receptor (KBF), the fMLP-R cDNA was cloned into the MSCV2.1 retroviral vector. The presence of a functional fMLP-R in KBF cells was confirmed by Northern blotting to demonstrate fMLP-R mRNA and by a positive intracellular calcium mobilization response to exogenous fMLP using the fluorescent dye Indo-1 as described previously (12Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were replicated with at least two separate KBM, KBP, and KBF clones. The HaCaT as-PAFR model system was established using the RevTet-on system (Clontech). PAF receptor cDNA was cloned in a reversed orientation into theHindIII site of the response retroviral vector pRevTRE. The insert orientation was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. To generate the retroviruses, amphotropic packaging cell line Phoenix 293 was transfected with either the retroviral Tet-on regulator, the pRevTRE-as-PAFR, or the pRevTRE backbone using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), and transient supernatants containing infectious amphotropic retrovirus were collected 48 h later. In the first round of infection, the infectious supernatant made from the retroviral Tet-on regulator was used to infect the parental HaCaT cells, and cells resistant to 1 mg/ml G418 were subjected to infection with the infectious supernatant made from the pRevTRE-as-PAFR or the viral backbone pRevTRE and selected with 600 ॖg/ml hygromycin. To increase the number of gene copies in the cells, we performed a second round of infection in which the transduced HaCaT cells that were double resistant to G418 and hygromycin were infected with both viruses again. Calcium mobilization studies and IL-8 biosynthesis studies were performed as described previously (12Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). Radioligand binding studies with PAF-R antagonist [3H]WEB 2086 were conducted as described previously (12Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in triplicate in 24-well dishes and treated with 10 nm [3H]WEB 2086 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) ± 1 ॖm PAF. After a 16-h incubation at 4 °C, the cells were washed and solubilized with 17 Triton X-100, and radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. Specifically bound [3H]WEB 2086 was defined as the difference between the binding of the radioligand alone and in the presence of 1 ॖm PAF. The IκBM containing the S32A and S36A mutation of IκBα has been described previously (23Newton T.R. Patel N.M. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Stauss C.R. Goulet Jr., R.J. Nakshatri H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18827-18835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the retroviral DNA vector MIEG3, which uses enhanced green fluorescent protein as the selectable marker, was a kind gift of Dr. David Williams (University of Cincinnati) (24Williams D.A. Tao W. Yang F. Kim C. Gu Y. Mansfield P. Levine J.E. Petryniak B. Derrow C.W. Harris C. Jia B. Zheng Y. Ambruso D.R. Lowe J.B. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. Boxer L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1646-1654PubMed Google Scholar). To create KBM and KBP cells stably expressing IκBM, the IκBM cDNA was subcloned into theEcoRI site of MIEG3, and orientation was assessed by restriction endonuclease mapping and sequencing. Infectious amphotropic retroviruses were produced from both MIEG-IκBM and control MIEG backbone by transient transfection using standard protocols (19Southall M.D. Isenberg J.S. Nakshatri H. Yi Q. Pei Y. Spandau D.F. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45548-45554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Phoenix amphotropic packaging cell line was transfected with the DNA constructs using FuGENE 6, and the supernatants collected 48 h later containing infectious virions were then used to infect KBM/KBP cells. Transduced cells were sorted by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter on the basis of enhanced green fluorescent protein expression. Apoptosis was determined quantitatively using a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kit measures the enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells as a result of DNA degradation. The absorption was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The enrichment factor was calculated using the following formula: absorbance of apoptotic cells/absorbance of control cells. The activation of the caspase proteolytic cascade was measured by the direct assay of caspase-3 enzyme activity in cell lysates using a synthetic fluorogenic substrate (caspase-3 substrate, Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC (Ac-DEVD-AMC); Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) as described previously (25Kuhn C. Hurwitz S.A. Kumar M.G. Cotton J. Spandau D.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed for 1 h at 37 °C. Release of the fluorogenic AMC moiety was measured using a Hitachi F2000 spectrophotofluorometer (excitation, 380 nm; detection, 460 nm). The fluorescent intensity was converted to pmol of AMC released by comparison to standards of AMC (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The specific activity of caspase-3 in cell lysates was determined following quantitation of the total protein in the cell lysates (NanoOrange protein quantitation reagent, Molecular Probes). To measure intracellular hydrogen peroxide levels, cells that were plated on coverslips were loaded with a 10 ॖm concentration of the fluorescent dye CM-DCFDA (Molecular Probes) for 6 h at 37 °C in the dark. CM-DCFDA fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm using a Hitachi F2000 spectrophotofluorometer. Cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells in a 10-cm dish and allowed to stabilize for 1 day. Cells were then transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with 10 ॖg of NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-κB-luc) and 10 ॖg of pCMV-औ-galactosidase as an internal control for the transfection efficiency. 24 h after transfection cells were treated with CPAF, IL-1औ, or chemotherapeutic agents or were mock-treated and then harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) following an additional 6-h incubation. 20-ॖl aliquots of the lysates were assayed for औ-galactosidase and luciferase activities using an LB9501 luminometer (Lumat). Luciferase activities were normalized for each transfection using the control औ-galactosidase activities. Since PAF may have both receptor-dependent and -independent effects (secondary to the formation of biologically active metabolites), our laboratory has previously created a model system by transduction of the PAF-R into a PAF-R-deficient epidermal cell line to study the role of the PAF-R in epithelial cell biology. The human epidermal carcinoma cell line KB does not express functional PAF-Rs unlike normal human keratinocytes and the human keratinocyte-derived carcinoma cell line HaCaT (11Travers J.B. Huff J.C.

A PAF-R-positive KB cell line, KBP, was created by transducing KB cells with a replication-deficient MSCV2.1 retrovirus containing the human PAF-R cDNA. KB cells were also transduced with the retrovirus backbone alone to establish a vector control cell line, KBM. Expression of the PAF-R protein was verified by binding studies using radiolabeled PAF-R antagonist WEB 2086 (12Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium mobilization studies demonstrated that the KB PAF-R was functionally active (12Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this in vitro epidermoid system consists of both PAF-R-negative (KBM) and -positive (KBP) cells. In initial experiments, the dose-response (Fig.1) and time-response (Fig. 2) effects of etoposide, mitomycin C, C2 ceramide, and TRAIL on apoptosis in KBM versus KBP cells were determined by measurement of caspase-3 enzyme activity. Exposing KB cells to both chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and mitomycin C as well as C2 ceramide and TRAIL resulted in increased caspase-3 enzyme activity levels. The levels of caspase-3 enzyme induction were enhanced in PAF-R-expressing KBP over control KBM cells in response to etoposide and mitomycin C. However, C2 ceramide and TRAIL treatment resulted in similar levels of apoptosis in KBP and KBM cells. We next examined the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on KB cells using a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as a second distinct marker of apoptosis in carcinoma cells. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment with etoposide and mitomycin C resulted in an enhanced release of mono- and oligonucleosomes into the cytoplasm in KBP over KBM cells. However, exposure to 200 ॖm C2 ceramide or 40 ng/ml TRAIL (Fig. 3) resulted in similar responses between PAF-R-negative and -positive cells. These studies demonstrate that the presence of the PAF-R results in enhanced apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and mitomycin C.Figure 2Time-dependent effects of etoposide, mitomycin C, C2 ceramide, and TRAIL on caspase-3 enzyme activation in KBM versus KBP cells.

This GPCR was chosen as a control since epithelial cells, unlike bacteria, do not produce the peptide ligand fMLP. Calcium mobilization assays with Indo-1-loaded KBF cells resulted in intracellular calcium responses to 100 nm fMLP confirming that the fMLP-R was functional (data not shown). Consistent with the notion that chemotherapeutic agents are not activating GPCRs in a ligand-independent fashion, transducing KB cells with the fMLP-R did not affect responses to etoposide or mitomycin C (Fig.4). The next studies were designed to assess whether endogenous levels of the epidermal PAF-R could affect responsiveness of the cells to chemotherapeutic agents. To address this question HaCaT keratinocytes that express native PAF-Rs were transduced with a retrovirus from which an antisense RNA corresponding to the PAF-R mRNA could be induced (HaCaTpRevTRE-as-PAFR). Radioligand binding studies with the PAF-R antagonist [3H]WEB 2086 were used to assess the ability of the antisense system to ablate PAF-R expression in HaCaT cells. Binding studies using 10 nm[3H]WEB 2086 ± 1 ॖm PAF revealed 56 ± 13 (mean ± S.E., n = 3) fmol of [3H]WEB 2086 specifically bound/106 untreated HaCaTpRevTRE-as-PAFR cells. In contrast, KBP cells specifically bound 357 ± 73 fmol of [3H]WEB 2086/106cells, and KBM cells did not specifically bind [3H]WEB 2086. HaCaTpRevTRE-as-PAFR cells treated with 10 mg/ml doxycycline for 48 h did not exhibit specific [3H]WEB 2086 binding. Doxycycline treatment of control HaCaTpRevTRE cells did not affect [3H]WEB 2086-specific binding (48 ± 8 in untreatedversus 55 ± 9 fmol/106 cells in treated cells). Measurements of intracellular calcium flux or IL-8 production in response to PAF-R agonists were used as functional tests to confirm ablation of endogenous PAF-R expression in doxycycline-treated HaCaTpRevTRE-as-PAFR cells. As shown in Fig.5A, doxycycline (10 mg/ml) treatment of HaCaTpRevTRE-as-PAFR cells inhibited PAF-induced intracellular calcium flux yet had no effect on calcium mobilization induced by bradykinin, which acts via a separate GPCR. Similarly doxycycline pretreatment prevented CPAF-induced but not phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced IL-8 production in HaCaTpRevTRE-as-PAFR cells (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the radioligand binding studies, doxycycline pretreatment did not affect Ca2+mobilization responses or IL-8 production by PAF or the non-metabolizable PAF-R agonist CPAF in control HaCaTpRevTRE cells (Fig. 5, A and B). These studies confirm the ability to ablate PAF-R expression in HaCaT cells using a novel retroviral Tet-inducible system. Ablation of the endogenous PAF-R in HaCaT cells resulted in a diminishment of caspase-3 induction due to chemotherapeutic agents mitomycin C and etoposide, yet it did not affect responses to C2 ceramide and TRAIL (Fig. 5C). Similar findings were obtained when apoptosis was measured by release of mono- and oligonucleosomes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig.5D). These studies indicate that endogenous levels of PAF-R expression in carcinomas are adequate to modulate chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis. The finding that the epidermal PAF-R could augment apoptosis due to etoposide and mitomycin C led to further studies defining whether this was occurring secondarily to the pro-oxidative characteristics of these agents. To test this, KB cells were loaded with the H2O2-sensitive fluorescent dye CM-DCFDA, and levels of intracellular H2O2 were measured. As has been reported previously (26Goldman R. Moshonov S. Zor U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), activation of the epidermal PAF-R with CPAF resulted in increased intracellular H2O2 (Fig. 6). Consistent with their reported ability to induce a pro-oxidative stress (27Kagan V.E. Kuzmenko A.I. Tyurina Y.Y. Shvedona A.A. Matsura T. Yalowich J.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7777-7784PubMed Google Scholar, 28Xu B.H. Singh S.V. Cancer Lett. 1992; 66: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), both etoposide and mitomycin C treatment resulted in increased intracellular H2O2 levels in KB cells. The levels of intracellular H2O2generated in response to chemotherapeutic agents were greater in KBP than in KBM cells, which is consistent with the hypothesis that treatment of cells with etoposide or mitomycin C can activate the PAF-R. Treatment with TRAIL (Fig. 6) or C2 ceramide (not shown) did not significantly affect intracellular H2O2 levels. The next studies used antioxidants to confirm the involvement of oxidative stress in the ability of chemotherapeutic agents to activate the epidermal PAF-R and thus modulate apoptosis. Pretreatment of KB cells with the antioxidants trolox and resveratrol (29MacCarrone M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) blunted etoposide-mediated caspase-3 induction selectively in KBP cells (Fig.7). These antioxidants similarly blocked caspase-3 induction by mitomycin C by ∼507 in KBP cells (not shown). However, pretreatment with these two antioxidants did not affect apoptosis induced by etoposide or mitomycin C in KBM cells nor did it alter the effects of TRAIL or C2 ceramide in either KBM or KBP cells (not shown). Altogether these studies provide solid support for the hypothesis that oxidative stress induced by chemotherapeutic agents results in PAF-R activation, which can augment the proapoptotic effects of these agents. The mechanism by which the PAF-R could augment the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents is not known. Indeed activation of the epidermal PAF-R is linked to numerous signal transduction pathways that could be responsible for the augmented apoptotic effects (10Ishii S. Shimizu T. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 41-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). It should be noted that like a diverse group of stimuli including pro-oxidative stressors the epidermal PAF-R induces the transcription factor NF-κB, and activation of this same pathway has also been reported to have potent proapoptotic effects in various cell types (20McInnis J. Wang C. Anastasio N. Hultman M. Ye Y. Salvemini D. Johnson K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Wang Y. Qin Z.H. Nakai M. Chen R.W. Chuang D.M. Chase T.N. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Nakai M. Qin Z.H. Chen J.F. Wang Y. Chase T.N. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To test whether PAF-R-mediated activation of the NF-κB pathway was involved in the augmentation of chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis, we examined the ability of etoposide and mitomycin C to activate the NF-κB system in KB cells as well as whether a dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-κB could affect PAF-R-mediated augmentation of apoptosis in response to these chemotherapeutic agents. First, gel shift studies were used to examine levels of NF-κB in chemotherapeutic agent-treated KBP and KBF cells (Fig.8A). These studies demonstrated increased NF-κB binding in KBP cells in response to treatment with the PAF-R agonist CPAF. KBF cells responded to fMLP in similar fashion. However, treatment of KB cells with etoposide or mitomycin C resulted in an enhanced level of NF-κB binding activity in KBP over KBF cells. Transfection of KB cells with an NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid to measure NF-κB activity also revealed increased levels in KBP cells over KBM cells in response to treatment with etoposide and mitomycin C (Fig. 8B). These data indicate that these chemotherapeutic agents are functionally coupled to a biochemical pathway that results in NF-κB activation through the PAF-R. To assess whether PAF-R-mediated activation of the NF-κB pathway was exerting a protective or augmentative effect on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, KBM and KBP cells were transfected with a super-repressor IκB protein (KBM-MIEG-IκBM and KBP-MIEG-IκBM). We have previously shown that increased IκBα degradation and increased NF-κB binding activity induced by PAF-R agonist CPAF and IL-1औ were blocked in these cells transduced with this mutant non-degradable IκB protein (19Southall M.D. Isenberg J.S.

The presence of the super-repressor IκB protein did not affect the cytotoxic effects of etoposide or mitomycin C in PAF-R-negative KBM cells (Fig. 9). However, blockade of the NF-κB pathway inhibited the PAF-R-induced augmentation of apoptosis seen with this pro-oxidative chemotherapeutic agent. Levels of apoptosis induced by C2 ceramide (Fig. 9) or TRAIL (19Southall M.D. Isenberg J.S. Nakshatri H. Yi Q. Pei Y. Spandau D.F. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45548-45554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were similar in all KB cell types. Survival studies using trypan blue dye exclusion as a measure of cell viability at 24 and 48 h following treatment with etoposide and mitomycin C mirrored the caspase-3 studies demonstrating increased survival in KBP-IκBM over KBP-MIEG cells (not shown). These studies indicate that activation of the NF-κB pathway is responsible for PAF-R augmentation of chemotherapeutic agent-induced cytotoxicity. These studies provide evidence that in epithelial carcinoma cells the PAF-R can augment apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents via an NF-κB-dependent process. The augmentation of chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis was mediated through the PAF-R as it was only seen in PAF-R-expressing KBP and HaCaT carcinoma cells, and ablation of the endogenous PAF-R with an inducible antisense strategy blocked this increased cytotoxic effect. Our results describe a novel function for a G protein-coupled receptor, namely the induction of an NF-κB-dependent proapoptotic pathway by which the PAF-R can augment the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents. Recent studies have shown that oxidative stress can trigger the production of lipids with PAF-R agonist activity. For example, chemical oxidation of low density lipoproteins results in the production of a PAF-R activity that has been shown to consist of fragmented alkyl GPCs including 1-hexadecyl-2-butanoyl-GPC and 1-hexadecyl-2-butenoyl-GPC along with trace levels of authentic PAF (15Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria-Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28395-28404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Of significance, systemic exposure to the strong oxidative stress of tobacco smoke has been shown to induce the production of these PAF-R agonists in hamstersin vivo (32Lehr H.A. Weyrich A.S. Saetzler R.K. Jurek A. Arfors K.E. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2358-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Other pro-oxidative stressors such as UVB radiation can also stimulate the PAF-R through production of PAF and PAF-like lipids (7Barber L.A. Spandau D.F. Rathman S.C. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Hurwitz S.A. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Dy L.C. Pei Y. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26917-26922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and mitomycin C are activating the PAF-R through the production of PAF/PAF-like species. First, these chemotherapeutic agents are known pro-oxidative stressors (27Kagan V.E. Kuzmenko A.I. Tyurina Y.Y. Shvedona A.A. Matsura T. Yalowich J.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7777-7784PubMed Google Scholar, 28Xu B.H. Singh S.V. Cancer Lett. 1992; 66: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); this is confirmed in the present studies using the fluorescent dye CM-DCFDA to measure intracellular H2O2(Fig. 6). Other proapoptotic stimuli that do not induce an oxidative stress (C2 ceramide and TRAIL) did not have differential effects on KBM versus KBP cells. Second, pretreatment with antioxidants blocked the augmentation of chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis found in PAF-R-expressing KBP yet did not affect that in KBM cells. The finding that expression of the GPCR for fMLP in KB cells (KBF) did not affect chemotherapy-induced apoptosis suggests that these agents were not nonspecifically activating the GPCR in a ligand-independent fashion. Thus, the data presented in these studies support the hypothesis that these chemotherapeutic agents have the ability to induce the production of PAF/PAF-like species. Ongoing studies are attempting to define the structural identity of chemotherapy-induced PAF-R agonistic activity. The current studies also begin to define mechanistically how PAF-R activation can augment apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents. GPCRs including the PAF-R have been shown to activate the NF-κB system (19Southall M.D. Isenberg J.S. Nakshatri H. Yi Q. Pei Y. Spandau D.F. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45548-45554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Consistent with the involvement of NF-κB in the augmentation of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, etoposide and mitomycin C treatment of KBP cells resulted in a much greater level of NF-κB binding activity than that in KBM cells. Blocking NF-κB activation with a super-repressor IκB mutant decreased the augmentative effect of PAF-R expression on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Of note, preliminary studies in our laboratory indicate that the augmentation of UVB radiation-induced apoptosis in KBP cells is also blocked by ablation of NF-κB activation (data not shown). Although expression of the fMLP-R in KB cells did not affect chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, this receptor was found to have in common with the PAF-R the ability to activate the NF-κB pathway. Indeed fMLP treatment of KBF cells resulted in NF-κB binding by gel shift assays (Fig. 8B) and induced IκBα degradation (data not shown). Transfection of KBF cells with an NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid to measure NF-κB activity also revealed increased levels in KBF cells in response to fMLP. In fact, the effects of 100 nm fMLP on KBF cells were similar to those induced by 100 nm CPAF in KBP cells (data not shown). The ability of the fMLP-R to stimulate the NF-κB system yet not to affect chemotherapy-induced responses of NF-κB activation or apoptosis supports the contention that these pro-oxidative chemotherapeutic agents are activating the epidermal PAF-R via production of endogenous ligands. The mechanism(s) by which the NF-κB pathway can potentially promote or protect against apoptosis in epithelial carcinomas is unclear at this time and is an active area of study. Although NF-κB activation by the PAF-R appears to be responsible for promoting apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic agents or UVB radiation, we have previously demonstrated that PAF-R activation of NF-κB protects epithelial cells against apoptosis induced by TRAIL and tumor necrosis factor-α (19Southall M.D. Isenberg J.S.

That PAF-R-mediated activation of the NF-κB system could yield such dissimilar outcomes as either promoting or protecting against proapoptotic stimuli is consistent with data from several recent studies from a variety of cell types (18Kothny-Wilkes G.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For example, in rat primary forebrain culturesN-methyl-d-aspartate-induced apoptosis has been shown to be dependent upon superoxide-mediated NF-κB activation (20McInnis J. Wang C. Anastasio N. Hultman M. Ye Y. Salvemini D. Johnson K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported in glutamate-induced cytotoxicity (21Wang Y. Qin Z.H. Nakai M. Chen R.W. Chuang D.M. Chase T.N. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism for NF-κB-mediated cytotoxicity could involve its ability to up-regulate expression of p53 and Bax (20McInnis J. Wang C. Anastasio N. Hultman M. Ye Y. Salvemini D. Johnson K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Ongoing studies are evaluating the effects of NF-κB activation on the ratio of pro- and antiapoptotic protein expression in epithelial cells. Along with the effects of NF-κB translocation on apoptotic defenses, another possible explanation for the differences in PAF-R-mediated NF-κB-dependent protection against or augmentation of apoptosis lies in the nature of the proapoptotic stimuli. Chemotherapeutic agents and UVB radiation are potent DNA-damaging agents, and thus concomitant activation of the NF-κB system in the presence of significant DNA damage might not allow antiapoptotic proteins such as inhibitor of apoptosis proteins to be produced. Thus, other potential NF-κB-linked proapoptotic pathways could predominate. In summary, the present studies demonstrate that the presence of the epidermal PAF-R results in augmentation of the cytotoxic effects of etoposide and mitomycin C. We describe a novel pathway by which these pro-oxidative stressors induce PAF/PAF-like species that then activate the NF-κB pathway through the PAF-R. The biological significance of this pathway is not clear, but it could be the impetus for further studies to define whether the presence of the PAF-R could modulate chemotherapeutic responses in vivo. Finding that this novel pathway is an important determinant in the effectiveness of certain chemotherapeutic agents would be useful for planning chemotherapeutic strategies in PAF-R-expressing tumor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2012616907,"Abstract The 3-O-sulfotransferases (3OSTs) catalyze the addition of sulfate groups at the 3-OH site of glucosamine in heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which serve as critical mediators of various biological functions. We demonstrate that the3OST2 isoform is expressed at high levels in the rat pineal specifically during the daylight hours. The dramatic diurnal rhythm of 3OST2 is regulated by central clock-controlled activities of the superior cervical ganglion, persists in constant darkness, and is inducible by light at nighttime. Importantly,3OST2 transcription is blocked by β-adrenergic agonists that activate the pineal melatonin formation and is induced by β-adrenergic antagonists, which block melatonin production in vivo. Because of the inverse expression and regulation patterns of 3OST2 with serotonin N-acetyltransferase, the enzyme controlling the melatonin rhythm in the pineal, we tested the effects of forced expression of 3OST2 in the night pineals onN-acetyltransferase gene expression and melatonin production and found that, surprisingly, 3OST2 expression at night fails to interfere with melatonin synthesis. These data suggest 3OST2 may serve a unique function in the pineal that may be independent of melatonin formation."
https://openalex.org/W1999558966,"Several recent studies have suggested that resumption of oocyte meiosis, indicated by germinal vesicle breakdown or GVBD, involves inhibition of endogenous heterotrimeric G proteins in both frogs and mice. These studies imply that a heterotrimeric G protein(s), and hence its upstream activator (a G protein-coupled receptor or GpCR), is activated in prophase oocytes and is responsible for maintaining meiosis arrest. To test the existence and function of this putative GpCR, we utilized a mammalian G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK3) and β-arrestin-2, which together are known to cause GpCR desensitization. Injection of mRNA for rat GRK3 caused hormone-independent GVBD. The kinase activity of GRK3 was essential for GVBD induction as its kinase-dead mutant (GRK3-K220R) was completely ineffective. Another GRK3 mutant (GRK3-ΔC), which lacked the C-terminal Gβγ-binding domain and which was not associated with oocyte membranes, also failed to induce GVBD. Furthermore, injection of rat β-arrestin-2 mRNA also induced hormone-independent GVBD. Several inhibitors of clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis (the clathrin-binding domain of β-arrestin-2, concanavalin A, and monodansyl cadaverine) significantly reduced the abilities of GRK3/β-arrestin-2 to induce GVBD.

Fully grown Xenopus laevis oocytes are arrested at the prophase of meiosis I. Reinitiating of meiosis, or oocyte maturation, is triggered by the ovarian hormone progesterone (1Masui Y. J. Exp. Zool. 1967; 166: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Progesterone, likely through its cytoplasmic receptor xPR (2Bayaa M. Booth R.A. Sheng Y. Liu X.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Markert C.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1971; 177: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). One important signaling pathway regulated by progesterone appears to be intracellular cAMP. It is generally agreed that progesterone induces a modest (20%) reduction of cAMP (5Smith L.D. Development. 1989; 107: 685-699PubMed Google Scholar), likely by inhibiting membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases (6Sadler S.E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6368-6373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Finidori-Lepicard J. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Hanoune J. Baulieu E.E. Nature. 1981; 292: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The importance of cAMP reduction is underlined by the demonstration that both forskolin (8Schorderet-Slatkine S. Baulieu E.-E. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 1385-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and isobutylmethylxanthine (9Sadler S.E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10644-10650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) block progesterone-induced oocyte maturation. However, the classical Gi inhibitor Bordetella pertussis toxin does not prevent progesterone from inhibiting adenylyl cyclase or inducing oocyte maturation (10Sadler S.E. Maller J.L. Cooper D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 526-531PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A. Ma C. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that progesterone action is not mediated by the activation of classical Gi proteins. This puzzle appears to be resolved by the finding that inhibition of endogenous adenylyl cyclase-activating G proteins causes spontaneous oocyte maturation. Jaffe and colleagues demonstrated, first in the frog (12Gallo C.J. Hand A.R. Jones T.L.Z. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and later in mice (13Mehlmann L.M. Jones T.L. Jaffe L.A. Science. 2002; 297: 1343-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), that injection of neutralizing antibodies against mammalian Gsα causes oocyte maturation, suggesting that endogenous Xenopus Gsα plays a dominant role in maintaining prophase arrest. On the other hand, we demonstrated that inhibition of endogenous G protein βγ subunits (via injection of Gβγ scavengers) lowers oocyte cAMP and induces oocyte maturation (11Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A. Ma C. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Gβγ subunits increases oocyte cAMP (11Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A. Ma C. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and inhibits progesterone-induced oocyte maturation (11Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A. Ma C. Liu X.J. Curr.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41512-41520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Together these studies suggest the existence of an activated G protein(s) in prophase oocytes that maintains high levels of cAMP and prophase arrest. We postulated that this G protein(s) is activated by an endogenous G protein-coupled receptor (GpCR) that is activated in prophase oocytes (11Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A. Ma C. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this study, we wished to explore a well characterized aspect of GpCR signaling, receptor desensitization, to validate the existence and function of the putative GpCR in maintaining prophase arrest in frog oocytes. A general mechanism governing GpCR desensitization has emerged from work carried out on β-adrenergic receptors and many other GpCRs (15Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). A G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) phosphorylates activated, usually agonist-occupied, GpCR, creating a binding site for a regulatory protein, β-arrestin. Binding of β-arrestin to the GpCR prevents the latter from further binding to its target G protein, thus resulting in GpCR desensitization. In addition, β-arrestin also serves as an adaptor for clathrin-coated pits. The latter function of the β-arrestin thus initiates clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the GpCR. We reasoned that overexpression of GRKs and β-arrestin in frog oocytes may disrupt the tonic GpCR signaling in prophase oocytes causing GpCR desensitization and endocytosis. Such interventions may therefore cause spontaneous oocyte maturation. The nucleotide sequence encoding full-length rat GRK3 (16Arriza J.L. Dawson T.M. Simerly R.B. Martin L.J. Caron M.G. Snyder S.H.

The amplified cDNA was digested and ligated into pCS2+HA, as described above for full-length β-arrestin-2. The resultant plasmid encoded HA-β-arrestin-C. Oocytes were injected with mRNA (10 ng per oocyte, unless otherwise indicated) encoding HA-GRK3 or HA-GRK3-K220R. Following an overnight incubation, 20 oocytes were lysed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μl/oocyte) by forcing through a pipette tip. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and then were immune-precipitated with anti-HA antibodies. Immune complexes were resuspended in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100; 15 μl per sample). Kinase reaction was initiated with the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm ATP, 14 μg each of myelin basic protein and β-casein. The kinase reaction was carried out at room temperature for 30 min and was stopped with the addition of equal volume of 2× SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Other procedures employed in this study have been described in our previous publications (2Bayaa M. Booth R.A.

To test whether mammalian GRKs can induce frog oocyte maturation, we subcloned rat GRK3 into pCS2+ (17Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) for in vitro mRNA synthesis. (All cDNA constructs are depicted in Fig.1.) Injection of GRK3 mRNA indeed caused efficient GVBD, with maturation spots indistinguishable from that induced by progesterone (Fig.2 A). Typically, GRK3-induced GVBD lagged several hours behind progesterone-induced GVBD (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Kinase activity of GRK3 was essential for GVBD induction. A, 50 or more oocytes were either injected with water (control) or GRK3 mRNA or incubated with progesterone (Pg, 1 μm). At the indicated time following the injection (or the addition of progesterone), GVBD were scored and expressed as % of total treated oocytes. Although different batches of oocytes varied in their GVBD response time, GRK3-induced GVBD always lagged several hours behind Pg-induced GVBD. Typical images of oocytes in each group were shown. B, oocytes injected with the indicated mRNAs were incubated overnight in OR2. GVBD were scored and expressed as % of total injected oocytes. Shown are means with S.D. of four to six independent experiments. Shown above the bars are actual numbers of GVBD-positive oocytes over those of treated oocytes. The sign * denotes p < 0.001 in pair-wise Student's t test. C, following GVBD scoring (as in B), oocytes were lysed and the resultant extracts were analyzed for MOS accumulation, Xenopus MAP kinase (xMAPK) phosphorylation, and MPF assays (using histone H1 as an in vitro substrate) (40Nebreda A.R. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1979-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). D, oocytes injected with water or mRNA for HA-GRK3 or HA-GRK3-K200R were incubated overnight in OR2. Extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA monoclonal antibodies. The immune complexes were subjected to in vitro kinase assays using both β-casein and myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrates (41Benovic J.L. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (upper panel). An aliquot of the immune complexes were also subjected to immune blotting with anti-HA antibodies (lower panel). Shown are representatives of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that the non-catalytic C terminus of bovine GRK2 (71% identical to its counterpart in rat GRK3), when engineered with a geranylgeranylation site for membrane attachment, caused GVBD by scavenging endogenous G protein βγ complexes (11Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A. Ma C. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The geranylgeranylation site was necessary since the wild type C terminus was ineffective (11Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A. Ma C. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As GRK3 (or GRK2) does not contain a geranylgeranylation site (or any other sites for posttranslational modifications for membrane attachment), it was unlikely that GRK3 functioned as efficient Gβγ scavengers to induce GVBD. Nevertheless, to rule out this possibility, we substituted the catalytically essential lysine residue (Lys220) (16Arriza J.L. Dawson T.M. Simerly R.B. Martin L.J. Caron M.G. Snyder S.H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with arginine (K220R). In contrast to wild type GRK3, GRK3-K220R was completely ineffective in GVBD induction (Fig. 2 B). To facilitate biochemical analyses of GRK3 and GRK3-K220R, we engineered an N-terminal HA tag (18Booth R.A. Cummings C. Tiberi M. Liu X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6719-6725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to each of them, generating HA-GRK3 and HA-GRK3-K220R respectively. HA-GRK3 was slightly less efficient than untagged GRK3 in GVBD induction, whereas HA-GRK3-K220R was, as expected, incapable of inducing GVBD (Fig. 2 B). To confirm that GRK3-induced GVBD was accompanied by activation of the various maturation-specific protein kinases (MOS, MAP kinase, and MPF), we analyzed them in extracts derived from mRNA-injected oocytes. Clearly, HA-GRK3 or GRK3, but not their kinase-dead counterparts, induced MOS synthesis and activated both MAP kinase and MPF (Fig.2 C). We carried out immune kinase assays to determine the kinase activities of HA-GRK3 and HA-GRK3-K220R. Anti-HA antibodies pulled down similar amounts of the two proteins in mRNA-injected oocytes (Fig. 2 D, lower panel). However, only HA-GRK3 immunoprecipitates contained significantly greater kinase activities when compared with control immunoprecipitates (derived from extracts of water-injected oocytes) (Fig. 2 D, upper panel). These results clearly indicate that the kinase activity of GRK3 is essential for GVBD induction and suggest that GRK3 induced GVBD via a mechanism different from scavenging oocyte Gβγ(11Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A. Ma C. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In intact cells, the abilities of GRKs to phosphorylate their substrates, agonist-occupied GpCRs, are dependent on their membrane association (22Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Whereas some GRKs (GRK1, GRK4, and GRK6) are intrinsically membrane-bound because they contain posttranslational lipid attachments, GRK3 and GRK2 need to bind membrane-bound Gβγ complexes (22Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). To determine whether Gβγ binding is required for GRK3 to induce GVBD, we constructed GRK3-ΔC in which the C-terminal Gβγ-binding domain (amino acids 546–688) (23Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Touhara K. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) had been deleted. Fig. 3 A shows that both HA-GRK3 (lane 1) and HA-GRK3-ΔC (lane 2) were expressed efficiently in mRNA-injected oocytes. However, only wild type HA-GRK3 was partially associated with oocyte membranes (Fig.3 A, lane 5), whereas HA-GRK3-ΔC was completely “cytosolic.” Following immunoprecipitation, both HA-GRK3 and HA-GRK3-ΔC exhibited in vitro kinase activities, although HA-GRK3-ΔC was less robust in phosphorylating myelin basic protein and β-casein (Fig. 3 B). Despite retaining considerablein vitro kinase activities, HA-GRK3-ΔC was not able to induce any GVBD, nor was it capable of activating any of the protein kinases in frog oocytes (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate the essential role of the C-terminal Gβγ-binding domain of GRK in membrane association and in GVBD induction and, therefore, lend further support that GRK3 induced GVBD via phosphorylating a membrane-bound GpCR. If GRK3-induced GVBD was mediated via phosphorylation and desensitization of an endogenous GpCR, it must work together with an endogenous β-arrestin protein (15Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to test whether overexpression of a mammalian β-arrestin could also induce GVBD. Rat β-arrestin-2 cDNA (20Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pCS2-HA vector (18Booth R.A. Cummings C. Tiberi M. Liu X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6719-6725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Injection of HA-β-arrestin-2 mRNA caused robust GVBD (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the C-terminal clathrin-binding domain of β-arrestin-2, HA-β-arrestin-C, was unable to induce GVBD. HA-β-arrestin-2-induced GVBD followed a time course very similar to that of GRK3-induced GVBD and both lagged behind progesterone-induced GVBD (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether GRK3 and HA-β-arrestin-2 co-operate in GVBD induction, we injected low concentrations (1 ng per oocyte) of GRK3 or HA-β-arrestin-2 mRNA alone or in combination. As shown in Fig.4 C, injection of either mRNA alone caused little GVBD, whereas co-injection of both caused significant percentages of GVBD. These results clearly indicate synergism between β-arrestin-2 and GRK3 in GVBD induction, consistent with the involvement of GpCR desensitization (22Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). If GRK3/β-arrestin-2 induced GVBD via the desensitization of a cAMP-raising GpCR, we expected that the GVBD induction would be blocked by forskolin. Indeed, incubation of GRK3- or β-arrestin-2-injected oocytes with forskolin completely blocked GVBD induction (Fig.5). Upon removal of forskolin (by simply transferring oocyte to fresh OR2) and further incubation, significant percentages of the mRNA-injected oocytes eventually underwent GVBD (Fig. 5). In addition to GpCR desensitization, GRKs and β-arrestins also promote GpCR endocytosis (15Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In particular, β-arrestins serve to target GpCR to clathrin-coated pits (15Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Krupnick et al.(21Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that the overexpression of the clathrin-binding domain of β-arrestin blocks GpCR endocytosis. If clathrin-mediated GpCR endocytosis played any role in GRK3/β-arrestin-2-induced GVBD, HA-β-arrestin-C should interfere with the GVBD induction. Indeed, injection of β-arrestin-C mRNA significantly reduced, but did not eliminate, the ability of GRK3 or β-arrestin-2 to induce GVBD (Fig.6 A). As a control, we injected equal amounts of an mRNA (pCS2+MT (17Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar)) that encoded a similarly sized polypeptide. To further examine the involvement of clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway in GRK3-induced GVBD, we tested two widely used chemical inhibitors. The plant lectin concanavalin A (Con A) binds cell-surface glycoproteins and interferes with the formation of clathrin-coated pits (24Salisbury J.L. Condeelis J.S. Maihle N.J. Satir P. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1982; 46: 733-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with Con A blocks β-adrenergic receptor endocytosis without affecting G protein activation and activation of the second messenger cAMP (25Malbon C.C. Karoor V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29347-29352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of oocytes with Con A significantly reduced, but did not eliminate, the ability of GRK3 to induce GVBD (Fig. 6 B, lane 2). Another inhibitor for clathrin-pits is the polyamine monodansyl cadaverine (MDC). Unlike Con A, which acts extracellularly, MDC acts intracellularly to block clathrin polymerization (26Nandi P.K. Van Jaarsveld P.P. Lippoldt R.E. Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6706-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 C, MDC similarly reduced GRK3-induced GVBD. To rule out general toxicity or other nonspecific effects of the inhibitors in oocytes, we tested the effects of these inhibitors on v-Ras-induced GVBD. Although the mechanism by which v-Ras induces GVBD remains controversial (27Dupre A. Suziedelis K. Valuckaite R. de Gunzburg J. Ozon R. Jessus C. Haccard O. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6425-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that it would require receptor endocytosis. Indeed, neither Con A (Fig. 6 B) nor MDC (Fig. 6 C) had any inhibitory effect on v-Ras-induced GVBD. To further strengthen the argument that Con A and MDC inhibited GRK-induced GVBD through blockade of clathrin-mediated GpCR endocytosis, we tested the cholesterol-binding agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (28Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), which inhibits caveolae-mediated endocytosis (29Orlandi P.A. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin had no effect on GRK3- or v-Ras-induced GVBD (Fig. 6 C), suggesting that caveoli are not involved in GRK3-induced GpCR endocytosis. Recent studies have clearly indicated that G proteins play critical roles in maintaining meiosis arrest in both amphibian (11Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A. Ma C. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Gallo C.J. Hand A.R. Jones T.L.Z. Jaffe L.A. J.

However, the identity of the G proteins or whether these G proteins are regulated by classical GpCRs remains unclear. For example, receptors with intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activities have been implicated in regulating G proteins (18Booth R.A. Cummings C. Tiberi M. Liu X.J. J. Biol.

GRKs are highly specialized protein kinases that preferentially phosphorylate activated (agonist-occupied), as opposed to inactive or antagonist-occupied, GpCRs (22Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). That GRK3 was able to induce GVBD therefore represents the first and compelling experimental support for the notion that prophase oocytes contain an active GpCR and that this GpCR is responsible for maintaining meiosis arrest (11Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A. Ma C. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,13Mehlmann L.M. Jones T.L. Jaffe L.A.

Morris A.J. Surguchov A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26515-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) can be phosphorylated by GRK2 and GRK3. However, the physiological significance of these phosphorylation events remains unknown. Another example of non-GpCR substrate is the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor, which is specifically phosphorylated by a splicing variant of GRK6 (GRK6A) but not by other GRK6 variants or other GRKs (37Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24328-24334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We believe that GRK3-induced GVBD involves phosphorylation of a GpCR, rather than any of these non-GpCR substrates. First, GRK3-induced GVBD required membrane association of the kinase mediated by the C-terminal Gβγ-binding domain, consistent with the involvement of a membrane-bound GpCR. Second, GRK3-induced GVBD was blocked by forskolin, indicating the involvement of inhibition of cAMP signaling pathway. Third, both GRK3 and β-arrestin-2 are potent GVBD inducers and act synergistically, consistent with the involvement of GpCR desensitization. Furthermore, several inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis significantly reduced the abilities of GRK3/β-arrestin-2 to induce GVBD, supporting a role of GpCR endocytosis in GVBD induction. However, as only partial inhibition was observed with these inhibitors (Fig. 6, A–C), it appears that clathrin-mediated endocytosis may not be absolutely required for GVBD induction. In other words, GpCR desensitization caused by GRK3/β-arrestin-2 may be sufficient to cause GVBD. In any event, these data strongly support the existence of an activated GpCR that is responsible for maintaining prophase arrest. As GRK3 and β-arrestin-2 are known to cause desensitization of multiple GpCR in mammalian cells (15Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), the data presented here do not by themselves suggest any specific GpCR as the oocyte target. However, the β-arrestin-2 constructs should provide a valuable tool to identify this putative oocyte meiosis inhibitor (11Sheng Y. Tiberi M. Booth R.A. Ma C. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The results presented here raise the interesting question of whether progesterone induces GVBD by activating endogenous GRK-mediated GpCR desensitization/endocytosis. We have attempted to determine whether progesterone can modulate HA-GRK3 activities by immune kinase assays. These attempts have not yielded consistent results, perhaps because the “active” state of GRK3 (e.g. Gβγ binding and/or membrane association) only exists in intact cells and cannot be maintained following cell lysis and immunoprecipitation. However, we have isolated two partial cDNAs, 2J. Wang and X. J. Liu, unpublished data. one most similar to mammalian GRK2 and the other to GRK3, from a Xenopusoocyte cDNA library (38Rebagliati M.R.

Further work will be required to clarify the possible role of these endogenous GRKs in regulating progesterone-induced oocyte maturation. We thank Drs. Robert J.

To date, three molecular mechanisms are known for NRTIs resistance: (i) selective alterations in inhibitor binding and/or incorporation (discrimination), (ii) template/primer repositioning, which influences NRTIs incorporation, and (iii) phosphorolytic removal of an incorporated chain-terminating NRTI from the 3′-end of the nascent DNA strand (4Sluis-Cremer N.

High levels of d4T resistance appear concomitantly with resistance to zacitalbine (ddC) and zidovudine (AZT) and seem to correlate with the acquisition of complex patterns of mutations, suggesting that it would be difficult for a single mutation in the HIV-1 RT gene to decrease the incorporation efficiency for d4T (5Iversen A.K.N.

In the present study we show, for the first time, that a NNRTI resistance mutation at codon 181 selected by nevirapine (NVP) or other NNRTIs can contribute to a decreased sensitivity to d4T inhibition, by two indepedent resistance mechanisms: increased nucleotide selectivity and specific phosphorolytic removal. NVP and d4T were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Bristol-Myers Squibb, respectively.

Poly(rA), oligo(dT), the 66- and 24-mer oligodeoxynucleotides and unlabeled dNTPs were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. GF/C filters were supplied by Whatman. d4T triphosphate was synthesized in the laboratory of the authors as reported previously (11Dyatkina N.B. von Janta-Lipinski M. Minasyan S.K. Kukhanova M.K.

All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck or Fluka. The coexpression vectors pUC12N/p66(His)/p51 with the wild type or the mutant (Y181I, Y188L, and K103N) forms of HIV-1 RT p66 were kindly provided by Dr. S. H. Hughes (NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center) and purified as follows (2Maga G. Amacker M. Ruel N. Hübscher U. Spadari S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain JM109(DE3) harboring the corresponding expression plasmids was grown at 37 °C in 1 liter Luria Broth to anA 600 of 0.6. Isopropylthiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5m NaCl, 1 mm PMSF), and subjected to a French press. The mixture was cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap Chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) complexed with Co2+ ions and equilibrated in buffer A. The enzyme was eluted from the column with a 0–0.5 M imidazole HCl gradient in buffer A. Pooled fractions were dialyzed against buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 mm PMSF, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and loaded onto a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B. The HIV-1 RT proteins were eluted from the column with a 50–500 mm NaCl gradient in buffer B. Pooled fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm PMSF. All enzymes were purified to >95% purity and had a specific activity on poly(rA)/oligo(dT) of: HIV-1 p66(His)/p51, 75,670 units/mg; p66(K103N)/p51, 96,415 units/mg; p66(Y181I)/p51, 65,770 units/mg; p66(Y188L)/p51, 79,050 units/mg. 1 unit of DNA polymerase activity corresponds to the incorporation of 1 nmol of dNMP into acid-precipitable material in 60 min at 37 °C. All enzymes were purified to >95% purity, as judged by silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities were assayed as described in the presence of 0.5 μg of poly(rA)/oligo(dT)10:1 (0.3 μm 3′-OH ends), 10 μm [3H]dTTP, and 2–4 nm RT. When the 5′-32P-labeled d24:d66-mer template was used, a volume of 10 μl contained 0.05 μm (3′-OH ends) of the DNA template and nucleotides as indicated in the figure legends. After incubation at 37 °C, the products of the reaction were separated on a 7 m urea/20% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Quantification of the products was performed by scanning the gel with a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and integrating with the program ImageQuant. Time-dependent incorporation of radioactive nucleotides into the different template-primers at different nucleotide substrate concentrations was monitored by removing 25-μl aliquots at 2-min time intervals. Initial velocities of the reaction were then plotted against the corresponding substrate concentrations. When the 5′-32P-labeled d24:d66-mer template was used, initial velocities after 10 min of incubation at 37 °C in the presence of different substrate concentrations were calculated from the integrated gel band intensities (see also below). For determination of the K m andk cat values, an interval of substrate concentrations from 0.2 K m to 10Km was used. For K i determination, an interval of inhibitor concentrations between 0.2K i and 5 Ki was used in the inhibition assays. All values were calculated by non-linear least squares computer fitting of the experimental data to the appropriate rate equations. K m, V max, and k cat values were determined according to the Michaelis-Menten equation.K i values were calculated according to the equation for competitive inhibition. The values of integrated gel band intensities in dependence of the nucleotide substrate concentrations were fitted to the equation:I*T /I T−1 =V max[dNTP]/(K m + [dNTP]), where T = target site, the template position of interest and I*T = the sum of the integrated intensities at positions T, T+1 … T+n. The sensitivity of recombinant HIV-1 RTs carrying NNRTIs resistance-associated mutations to the inhibition by the dideoxynucleoside triphosphate analogs ddTTP, ddCTP (the active form of zalcitabine), AZTTP (the active form of zidovudine), and d4TTP (the active form of stavudine) was tested in comparison with the wild type enzyme. As can be seen from the results summarized in TableI, only the mutation at codon 181 significantly reduced the affinity of the enzyme for the dTTP substrate, with an increase of >2.5-fold in the measuredK m values with respect to wild type RT. The same mutation was also associated with an increase in theK i values for ddCTP, ddTTP, and d4TTP, with respect to wild type RT. In contrast, no significant differences were found for AZTTP inhibition.Table IInhibition by nucleoside analogs of RNA-dependent DNA synthesis catalysed by HIV-1 RT wt and mutantsRTdTTP (K m)K iddTTPddCTPAZTTPd4TTPμmμmμmμmμmwt4.2 (±0.5)1-aErrors ± S.D. calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Each value is the mean of three independent experiments.

Fig. 1 Ashows the incorporation of d4TTP by HIV-1 wild type RT and for the 181 mutant. Quantification of the gel bands intensities clearly showed a reduced efficiency of the 181 mutant RT in utilizing d4TTP as the substrate with respect to wild type RT (Fig. 1 B). As summarized in Table II, mutations at codons 103 and 188 did not alter the incorporation efficiencies (k cat/K m values) for AZTTP, d4TTP, and dTTP with respect to wild type RT. In contrast, the mutation at codon 181 decreased the incorporation efficiency for dTTP by 3-fold and for d4TTP by about 15-fold. On the other hand, the 181-mutated RT was able to incorporate AZTTP with efficiency similar to wild type RT.Table IIKinetic parameters of deoxy- and dideoxynucleoside triphosphate analogs incorporation catalyzed by wild type and mutated HIV-1 RTSubstrateRTWild typeK103NY181IY188LdTTP K m (μm)0.4 (±0.05)0.2 (±0.02)0.7 (±0.05)0.3 (±0.05) k cat(s−1)0.05 (±0.005)0.03 (±0.005)0.03 (±0.005)0.03 (±0.005) k cat/K m (μm−1s−1)0.125 (±0.005)0.15 (±0.05)0.042 (±0.005)0.1 (±0.02)dCTP K m (μm)9.5 (±0.05)ND2-aNot done.

Open table in a new tab As summarized in TableIII, comparison of the incorporation efficiencies k cat/K m for the natural substrates dTTP or dCTP and the cognate dideoxy analogs AZTTP, d4TTP, or ddCTP indicated that the dideoxy analogs were preferred as substrates to the corresponding deoxynucleotides. However, compared with wild type enzyme, discrimination between d4TTP and dTTP and between ddCTP and dCTP was 5-fold and 2-fold, respectively, more efficient with the 181-mutated RT. None of the other NNRTIs-associated mutations significantly affected the specificity of the RT for the nucleotide analogs studied, with the exception of the 188 mutation, which induced a 2.5-fold higher preference for d4TTP incorporation over dTTP than the wild type enzyme.Table IIIRelative incorporation efficiencies of dideoxynucleoside triphosphates analogs by wild type and mutated HIV-1 RTRTRelative efficiency3-aThe relative efficiency is calculated as the ratio between thek cat/K m values reported in TableII for the specified deoxynucleotides.

Open table in a new tab One important mechanism of NRTIs resistance by HIV-1 RT resides in its ability to unblock a dideoxy-terminated primer by removing the last incorporated nucleotide through a PPi- or ATP-dependent phosphorolytic reaction. In a first series of experiments, the ability of ATP or PPi to reduce the inhibition of either wild type RT or 181-mutated RT by AZTTP and d4TTP was evaluated. The reduction observed with AZTTP and d4TTP was comparable for both enzymes in the case of the PPi-dependent pathway (data not shown). On the other hand, in the ATP-dependent pathway, the inhibition by d4TTP of the 181-mutated RT was reduced more than 10-fold than in the case of wild type enzyme (Fig. 1 C). In a second series of experiments, phosphorolytic removal by RT in the presence of ATP of the last incorporated nucleotide from primers terminated by either d4TMP or AZTMP (resulting in a shorter product) was directly visualized by a polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 1 D, the rate of unblocking was higher for the 181-mutated RT (0.15 (±0.01) s−1) than for the wild type enzyme (0.025 (±0.01) s−1) for d4TMP. No significant differences were found for AZTMP (data not shown). The mutations Y181I/C are involved in high level NNRTIs resistance, especially to nevirapine and delavirdine (1Loveday C. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2001; 26 Suppl. 1: S10-S24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Maga G. Amacker M. Ruel N. Hübscher U. Spadari S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The results presented in this study show, for the first time, a role of a NNRTIs resistance mutation in contributing to d4T resistance by two different mechanisms: increased nucleotide selection and phosphorolytic removal (Table III and Fig. 1). In addition, we recently showed that d4T could inhibit the replication of a recombinant HIV-1 strain carrying the Y181C substitution, 5–10-fold less efficiently with respect to wt and K103N mutant recombinant HIV-1 strains, thus confirming the impact of mutations at codon 181 on d4T resistance. 2Baldanti, F., Paolucci, S., Maga, G., Labò, N., Hübscher, U., Skoblov, A. Y., Victorova, L., Spadari, S., Minoli, L., and Gerna, G. (2003) AIDS, in press. These effects are specific for d4T (since AZT sensitivity was not significantly affected) and for the 181 mutation (since other common NNRTIs resistance mutations such as K103N or Y188L did not show any effect). The specificity observed for the Y181I mutation can be related to the fact that the changed amino acid is adiacent to the conserved catalytic residues Asp185 and Asp186. It is reasonable to hypothesize that this substitution alters the geometry of the active site of HIV-1 RT, resulting in a less favorable interaction with the nucleotide substrate. The fact that only d4T, but not AZT, was affected might be related to the differences in the structures of these two thymidine analogs. In particular, the azido group at the 3′-position of the sugar ring of AZT is known to stabilize binding of the drug to the enzyme. A major difference between AZT and d4T is that the latter drug bears a carbocyclic pentose ring, lacking any substituent at both the 2′- and 3′-positions, thus d4T might be in principle more sensitive to alterations in the nucleotide binding pocket. These findings can have immediate clinical implications; caution should be applied when considering d4T for rescue treatments following NNRTI-containing regimen failure, even in patients not previously exposed to the drug."

DsrA, a small 87-nucleotide non-coding RNA molecule, acts to increase translational efficiency of RpoS mRNA under some growth conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that DsrA binds directly to the 30 S ribosomal subunit with an observed equilibrium affinity of 2.8 × 107m−1. DsrA does not compete with RpoS mRNA or tRNAfMet for binding to the 30 S subunit. The 5′ end of DsrA binds to 30 S subunits with an observed equilibrium association constant of 2.0 × 106m−1, indicating that the full affinity of the interaction requires the entire DsrA sequence. In order to investigate translational efficiency of RpoS mRNA, we examined both ribosome-binding site accessibility and the binding of RpoS mRNA to 30 S ribosomal subunits. We find that that ribosome-binding site accessibility is modulated as a function of divalent cation concentration during mRNA renaturation and by the presence of an antisense sequence that binds to nucleotides 1–16 of the RpoS mRNA fragment. The ribosome-binding site accessibility correlates with the amount of RpoS mRNA participating in 30 S-mRNA “pre-initiation” translational complex formation and provides evidence that regulation follows a competitive model of regulation.

To initiate the process of transcribing a specific gene, the multisubunit bacterial RNA polymerase must select and bind to the promoter sequence of the gene or operon (1Record M.T. Reznikoff W.S.

There are several different classes of promoter sequences, each recognized by specific RNA polymerase holoenzymes containing appropriate ς subunits (2Gross C.A. Lonetto M. Losick R. McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1992: 129-175Google Scholar). The bacteria have evolved so that expression of entire families of proteins under specific growth conditions is initiated by transcription from a shared class of promoter sequences (2Gross C.A. Lonetto M. Losick R. McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1992: 129-175Google Scholar). In response to a range of external stimuli, the core RNA polymerase exchanges one type of ς factor for another, shutting off transcription of one family of proteins while initiating expression of another family (2Gross C.A. Lonetto M. Losick R. McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1992: 129-175Google Scholar, 3Loewen P.C. Hu B. Strutinsky J. Sparling R. Can. J.

As a result, the expression of entire gene families can be controlled by affecting the rate and extent of ς factor production (3Loewen P.C. Hu B. Strutinsky J. Sparling R. Can. J.

It is predicted that under normal growth conditions, the ribosome-binding site of RpoS mRNA is trapped in a secondary structure that results in repression of translational initiation (see Fig.1 A) (11Cunning C.

During osmotic shock, the regulatory factors are expected to increase the single-stranded nature of the ribosome-binding site (the “accessibility” of the ribosome-binding site) and therefore to increase the ability of the 30 S subunit to bind to the mRNA and the fraction of mRNA participating in translational initiation (3Loewen P.C.

It has been shown that the effects of DsrA ncRNA on rpoS expression are much greater in the presence of the protein Hfq (11Cunning C. Brown L. Elliott T. J.

The role of Hfq in the global regulation of gene expression increasingly appears to be that of a facilitator of RNA-RNA interactions that influence rates of mRNA translation and degradation (23Zhang A.

Cell. 2002; 9: 23-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The 3′ domain of DsrA interacts specifically with Hfq, and it has been proposed that Hfq assists in forming the DsrA:RpoS mRNA hybrid postulated to stimulate translation of RpoS mRNA (21Sledjeski D.D. Whitman C. Zhang A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In this work we demonstrate that DsrA specifically interacts with 30 S ribosomal subunits in vitro. This interaction may be important in the mechanism of rpoS regulation by DsrA.DISCUSSIONEarly models of translational regulation of rpoSpredicted that changes in mRNA structure resulting from bacterial exposure to stress would influence the accessibility of the ribosome-binding site to ribosomes and therefore translational efficiency (3Loewen P.C. Hu B. Strutinsky J. Sparling R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 707-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Muffler A. Traulsen D.D. Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The non-coding RNA molecule DsrA has been implicated in translational regulation of rpoS expression (15Sledjeski D.D. Gupta A. Gottesman S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3993-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 33Sledjeski D. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) as a factor influencing the ribosome-binding site accessibility. In this work, we describe our observation that the non-coding RNA DsrA binds to 30 S subunits. We demonstrate that the ribosome-binding site accessibility is modulated through changes in divalent cation concentration during mRNA renaturation as well as the presence of a DsrA-like antisense oligonucleotide that binds to nucleotides 1–16 of RpoS mRNA. The accessibility of the ribosome-binding site correlates with levels of RpoS mRNA participating in forming 30 S-mRNA “pre-initiation” complexes and provides evidence for a competitive model of regulation.30 S Subunits Bind the Non-coding RNA DsrA30 S ribosomal subunits bind to the ncRNA DsrA specifically, with an affinity comparable with that of many mRNA molecules for 30 S subunits. DsrA contains three stem loops (14Majdalani N. Cunning C. Sledjeski D. Elliott T. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12462-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 16Lease R.A. Cusick M.E. Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The (5′) stem loop contains the sequences that hybridize to RpoS mRNA (14Majdalani N. Cunning C. Sledjeski D. Elliott T. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12462-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 16Lease R.A. Cusick M.E. Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 3′ sequences are necessary for the interaction of DsrA with the protein Hfq (26Brescia C. Mikulecky P.J. Feig A.L. Sledjeski D.D. RNA (New York). 2003; 9: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hfq is also involved in regulating translation of RpoS mRNA. We investigated which part of the DsrA molecule was responsible for interacting with 30 S subunits. A weak interaction (K 30 S ∼2 × 106m−1) is observed between the 30 S subunit and the first 34 nucleotides of the DsrA sequence that forms the first stem loop. However, low filter retention of 30 S subunit-RNA complexes prevented us from accurately measuring the affinity of 30 S subunits to an RNA transcript containing the 3′ end sequences (nucleotides 23–87) of DsrA (data not shown). These results indicate that the full affinity of DsrA for the 30 S subunit (K 30 S∼2.8 × 107m−1) may depend upon proper folding of secondary and tertiary structure of the entire DsrA molecule.The translational regulator protein Hfq has been shown to associate with 70 S ribosomes (28Carmichael G.G. Weber K. Nivleau A. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3607-3612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and interacts with DsrA (21Sledjeski D.D. Whitman C. Zhang A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 26Brescia C. Mikulecky P.J. Feig A.L. Sledjeski D.D. RNA (New York). 2003; 9: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We expected that Hfq might be associated with our 30 S subunits and be involved in DsrA ncRNA binding. Hfq specifically binds a 3′ domain in DsrA (26Brescia C. Mikulecky P.J. Feig A.L. Sledjeski D.D. RNA (New York). 2003; 9: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and has been shown to interact strongly with DNA sequences (29Azam T.A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33105-33113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 30Takada A. Wachi M. Kaidow A. Takamura M. Nagai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using Hfq antisera demonstrates it is not present at detectable levels in our 30 S subunit preparations and therefore is not responsible for the interaction of the molecules with the 30 S subunit in our in vitro assays.DsrA binds to 30 S subunits with an affinity comparable with that of RpoS mRNA to the ribosomal subunit. We propose that RpoS mRNA and DsrA ncRNA bind to different sites on the 30 S subunit. In competition experiments between unlabeled DsrA and radiolabeled RpoS mRNA, 30 S subunits and DsrA ncRNA are both in excess over the radiolabeled RpoS mRNA. Because DsrA can bind to both 30 S subunits and to the 5′ end of the RpoS mRNA, excess DsrA is required to allow a fraction of DsrA to hybridize the RpoS mRNA and the rest to be available for 30 S subunit binding. If DsrA and RpoS mRNA bind to the same site of the ribosomal subunit, then at high concentrations of DsrA, RpoS mRNA will be displaced from the 30 S subunit. We do not observe this. The extent of RpoS mRNA bound to the 30 S subunit does not decrease even at 400 nm DsrA, suggesting that molecules are not competing for binding at the same site on the 30 S subunit. In similar competition experiments, we observed that tRNAfMet does not compete with DsrA for binding to 30 S subunits, suggesting that DsrA is not binding to the tRNA-binding site in the 30 S subunit either.The interaction of the mRNA with the 30 S subunit is stabilized in large part by interactions between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence on the mRNA and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence on the 3′ end of the 16 S rRNA (32Draper D.E. Gluick T.C. Schlax P.J. Simons R.W. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 415-436Google Scholar). Additional stabilizing interactions arise through contacts with ribosomal protein S1. We examined whether the DsrA ncRNA had any short regions of complementarity to the 16 S rRNA and found no complementary regions where both the ncRNA and the 16 S rRNA were predicted to be single-stranded. Examples of the regions predicted to have perfect Watson-Crick base pairing involve nucleotides 81–87 of DsrA with a conserved single-stranded bulge in the 16 S rRNA (nucleotides 606–612) and nucleotides 6–12 of DsrA with nucleotides 634–640 of the of the 16 S rRNA. The extent of proposed base pairing between DsrA and the 16 S rRNA in these and several other regions is comparable with the base pairing between Shine-Dalgarno sequences with other mRNA sequences, which may account for the similarity in affinity between 30 S subunits for DsrA and for typical mRNA messages. Although a sequence (or sequences) of the rRNA have not been ruled out in DsrA binding, it is possible that ribosomal proteins specifically interact with DsrA.Hybridization of RpoS mRNA to an Antisense DNA Oligonucleotide Increases Accessibility of the Ribosome-binding SiteAt low temperatures, the presence of the non-coding RNA DsrA increases translational efficiency of RpoS mRNA and is required for full induction of rpoS expression following osmotic shock (15Sledjeski D.D. Gupta A. Gottesman S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3993-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Hybridization of the ncRNA has been proposed to stabilize a structure of RpoS mRNA that is efficiently translated (14Majdalani N. Cunning C. Sledjeski D. Elliott T. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12462-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 16Lease R.A. Cusick M.E. Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12456-12461Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 18Lease R.A. Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9919-9924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the translational induction model, DsrA binds to an upstream RpoS mRNA sequence, preventing specific intra-molecular base pairing interactions in a helix containing the ribosome-binding site. Loss of the intra-molecular base pairs is expected to result in a locally single-stranded ribosome-binding site that is more readily translated than the normal repressed structure.In vivo work has demonstrated interactions between the non-coding RNA DsrA and a region of the RpoS mRNA that overlaps nucleotides 1–16 in our transcript (14Majdalani N. Cunning C. Sledjeski D. Elliott T. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12462-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). We observe that the affinity of DsrA for RpoS mRNA was low at 0 °C (data not shown). In vivo it has been shown that regulation by DsrA requires the presence of the protein Hfq. Hfq has been shown to facilitate RNA-RNA interactions and has been implicated in unfolding RNA structures that prevent formation of binary RNA complexes (11Cunning C. Brown L. Elliott T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4564-4570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Muffler A. Traulsen D.D. Fischer D. Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. J.

Both DsrA and RpoS mRNA are proposed to have extensive secondary structures in the regions that complement each other (14Majdalani N. Cunning C. Sledjeski D. Elliott T. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12462-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 16Lease R.A. Cusick M.E. Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12456-12461Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 34Belfort M. Lease R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9919-9924Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The interaction of DsrA with RpoS mRNA requires melting out secondary structure in both DsrA and RpoS and, therefore, may be thermodynamically or kinetically unfavorable in the absence of other factors (such as the protein Hfq). Even if DsrA had no secondary structure of its own, it is not perfectly complementary to the RpoS mRNA leader sequence and therefore has a lower affinity for the mRNA than a perfectly complementary sequence would have. In order to make a stronger hybrid complex and to eliminate the requirement for denaturing the DsrA structure, we designed an oligonucleotide, AS-(1–16), that perfectly complements the RpoS mRNA sequence. The effect of increasing intermolecular complementarity and decreasing self-hybridization is that we have made a molecule that hybridizes to renatured RpoS mRNA with an affinity of ∼9.5 × 106m−1 at 0 °C. We used this synthetic DNA oligonucleotide, AS-(1–16), to determine whether its hybridization to RpoS mRNA increases the accessibility of the ribosome-binding site. As expected, we observed an increase in the ability of the AS-(101–115) probe to interact with the ribosome-binding site when RpoS mRNA is hybridized to the AS-(1–16) DNA oligonucleotide.Ribosome-binding Site Accessibility Correlates Well with the Fraction of mRNA Participating in 30 S Subunit BindingIn determinations of the equilibrium affinity of 30 S subunits for RpoS mRNA, we find that less than 50% of the total RNA interacts with 30 S subunits at saturating concentrations. These data provide evidence for two functionally distinct fractions of RpoS mRNA. One fraction of the mRNA (up to about 50% of the total mRNA in our assays) can bind 30 S subunits to form complexes retained on a nitrocellulose filter or can compete with radiolabeled mRNA to bind 30 S subunits. We designate this fraction of the mRNA to be functionally “translationally active.” The other mRNA fraction is designated “translationally inactive.” It either does not bind to 30 S subunits in the concentration range (0–1.0 μm) we examined or it forms 30 S complexes that rapidly dissociate during the filtration and wash steps of our assay. Controlling the composition of the renaturation buffer of the mRNA can modulate the equilibrium distribution of the two fractions. In the experiments shown here, we have allowed the renaturing mRNA to equilibrate at 42 °C. The rates of interconversion between the “active” and “inactive” forms are greatly reduced by placing the reactions on ice. Differences in the fraction of total mRNA retained on the filter as well as differences in the accessibility to the ribosome-binding site suggest that there are differences in the mRNA structure that persist from renaturation until binding over varied incubation times (15–90 min) indicating that interconversion between different structures is significantly reduced at 0 °C. When the reactions are incubated at 42 °C rather than at 0 °C, we observe a greater extent of hybridization of the RpoS mRNA to AS-(101–116) (data not shown), indicating that at high temperatures, the interaction of AS-(101–115) with the renatured mRNA can shift the equilibrium distribution of mRNA structures. At low temperatures, the mRNA is kinetically trapped so that the inactive form cannot be converted to the active form. Two (or more) populations of RNA structures with different chemical and functional properties is not unusual and has been reported for RNAs as diverse as mRNAs (36de Smit M.H. van Duin J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 38: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and ribozymes (37Thirumalai D. Woodson S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 433-439Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar).We observe that renaturation conditions resulting in high levels of AS-(101–115) hybridization to the RpoS mRNA also increase fractional retention of RpoS-mRNA-30 S subunit complexes. These renaturation conditions result in mRNA that is a more effective competitor with radiolabeled RpoS mRNA for 30 S subunits. Renaturation with AS-(1–16) results in a 30–50% increase in the accessibility of the ribosome-binding site and up to an additional 30% of the mRNA participating in binding 30 S subunits determined by fractional retention data. These results are consistent with an interpretation that a ribosome-binding site that more easily interacts with single-stranded DNA is also efficient at 30 S subunit binding and translational initiation.Divalent Cation Concentration Influences Structure of the mRNAWe have explored whether the accessibility of the ribosome-binding site is modulated by exposure of the mRNA to different divalent cation concentrations. By using the antisense DNA oligonucleotide AS-(101–115) as a probe, we observed that the accessibility of the RpoS mRNA ribosome-binding site is greater when the mRNA is renatured in standard renaturation buffer than when the mRNA is renatured in buffer containing 40 mmMg2+. A small reduction in the affinity of 30 S subunits for RpoS mRNA renatured in the presence of 40 mmMg2+ or 40 mm putrescine2+ was observed. Analysis of filter retention data and competition data indicates that renaturing the mRNA in the presence of 40 mm Mg2+ results in a 30–35% decrease in the amount of the mRNA that is binding at saturating 30 S subunit concentrations relative to that for mRNA renatured in standard buffer. These data again support our conclusion that increased ribosome-binding site accessibility correlates with an increased fraction of mRNA participating in translational initiation events.Translational Repression and InductionTranslational regulation of rpoS appears to be consistent with a competitive (also called “displacement” (38de Smit M. Simons R.W. Simons R.W. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 495-540Google Scholar, 39Schlax P.J. Worhunsky D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)) model of regulation. Although small differences are detected in the affinity of both 30 S subunits and AS-(101–115) for the differentially renatured mRNA forms (see Table I), the primary effect of altering renaturation conditions appears to be to change the fraction of the mRNA participating in translational initiation events.Translational efficiency is evaluated from the rate of protein synthesis and may be proportional to the concentration of a stable ternary “Initiation Complex” composed of initiator tRNAfMet, the 30 S ribosomal subunit, and the mRNA (32Draper D.E. Gluick T.C. Schlax P.J. Simons R.W. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 415-436Google Scholar, 38de Smit M. Simons R.W.

Microbiol. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of this stable ternary complex involves two mechanistic steps: 1) the reversible formation of a pre-initiation complex stabilized by base pairing of the conserved Shine-Dalgarno sequence on the mRNA and its complement in the 16 S rRNA, followed by 2) an irreversible conformational change in the pre-initiation complex to form the stable ternary initiation complex, which is stabilized by codon-anticodon base pairing (Fig.8) (32Draper D.E.

The cells in zG, the outermost zone of the cortex, secrete aldosterone, the strongest mineralocorticoid; and those in zF, the middle zone, produce glucocorticoids such as corticosterone in most rodents and cortisol in other mammals including human. Finally, the cells in the zona reticularis, the innermost portion of the cortex, also secrete glucocorticoids in many mammals including rats and mice and produce adrenal androgens in human and some other mammals. In addition to these three, a zone composed of 3–4 layers of small round cells has been recognized between zG and zF in various animals (2Cain A.J. Harrison R.G. J.

Development and maintenance of the adrenocortical zones require many cellular processes including regulation of the steroidogenic gene expression and regulation of cell renewal and arrangements. Steroidogenic factor 1 (19Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) (SF-1, also referred to as Ad4BP (20Morohashi K.I. Omura T. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar)) is a transcription factor essential for embryonic development of steroidogenic organs including adrenal cortex and gonads (21Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). SF-1 also plays a pivotal role in the earlier steps of the adrenocortical steroidogenesis over the entire adrenal cortex by controlling expression of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (Cyp11a) and steroid 21-hydroxylase (22Morohashi K. Iida H. Nomura M. Hatano O. Honda S. Tsukiyama T. Niwa O. Hara T. Takakusu A. Shibata Y. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 643-653PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these features, SF-1 is unlikely to be a key regulator for the zonal differentiation of the steroidogenesis. Regarding factors regulating expression of the steroidogenic genes for the last steps of the syntheses, we previously suggested that AP-1 transcription factors were necessary for the spatially restricted expression of Cyp11b-1 in zFR (23Mukai K. Mitani F. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6003-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Mukai K. Mitani F. Agake R. Ishimura Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Other regulatory factors playing a crucial role in the zone-specific steroidogenesis of zFR have been unknown. Furthermore, no regulatory factor for the functional differentiation of the rest of the cortex, zG and zU, has been identified so far. Therefore, molecular mechanisms underlying the zonal differentiation of the adrenocortical steroidogenesis remain to be solved. The goal of this study was to explore unidentified factors that control the functional differentiation of adrenocortical cells. To this end, we used the mouse adrenocortical cell lines that we established recently (25Mukai K. Nagasawa H. Agake-Suzuki R. Mitani F. Totani K. Yanai N. Obinata M. Suematsu M. Ishimura Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). They are derived from the adrenal glands of transgenic mice (26Obinata M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,27Obinata M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) carrying a temperature-sensitive large T-antigen gene of simian virus 40, being at different degrees of differentiation from one another. In the present study, a subtractive cDNA cloning employing the adrenocortical cell lines, named AcA101 and AcA201, as well as a conventional cell line Y-1, was carried out. Among the cell lines, AcA101 is the most undifferentiated one which expresses neither Cyp11b-1 nor Cyp11b-2, whereas Y-1 is the most differentiated one that expresses Cyp11b-1 with a responsiveness to ACTH stimuli (28Schimmer B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A cDNA cloned from AcA101 cells by a subtractive hybridization encodes a protein termed adrenocortical zonation factor-1 (AZ-1), the subject of this paper. AZ-1 is a unique secretory protein with a preprocathepsin B-related structure carrying epidermal growth hormone (EGF) motifs. This study demonstrates that expression of AZ-1 in adrenocortical cells is inversely correlated with expression of Cyp11b-1 in vitro and in vivo. Mouse adrenocortical AcA101 and AcA201 cells were cultured at 33 °C, a permissive temperature for the mutant SV40 T-antigen protein, under the conditions described previously (25Mukai K. Nagasawa H. Agake-Suzuki R. Mitani F. Totani K. Yanai N. Obinata M. Suematsu M. Ishimura Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mouse adrenocortical Y-1 cells (28Schimmer B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were cultured at 37 °C with Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 107 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 107 heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen), 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 ॖg/ml streptomycin. The cells were incubated under a humidified atmosphere containing 57 CO2. Total RNA was extracted from AcA101, AcA201, and Y-1 cells with a modified single-step isolation method employing Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared with an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Amersham Biosciences) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). Poly(A)+ RNA (2 ॖg) from AcA101 cells was converted into cDNA with a NotI-oligo(dT) primer. A cDNA library of AcA101 cells was prepared using the λZipLox system (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Subtractive probes were prepared with the chemical cross-linking subtraction method using an RNA subtraction kit (Amersham Biosciences). Single-stranded cDNA (0.4 ॖg) of AcA101 cells was subtracted with poly(A)+ RNA (10 ॖg) of AcA201 or Y-1 cells by hybridization and chemical cross-linking reaction. To reduce signals from SV40 T-antigen mRNA, RNA encoding T-antigen was synthesized in vitro by using cloned T-antigen genes (25Mukai K. Nagasawa H. Agake-Suzuki R. Mitani F. Totani K. Yanai N. Obinata M. Suematsu M. Ishimura Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and was added to the hybridization reaction. The resulting subtracted cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol,Amersham Biosciences) using Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Biosciences). The AcA101 cDNA library (2 × 105plaque-forming units) was screened with the subtractive probes under stringent conditions. Positive plaques were isolated through a second screening process using digoxigenin-labeled cDNA (Roche Diagnostics) probes (not subtracted) from AcA101, AcA201, and Y-1 cells. Plasmids carrying a cDNA insert were recovered from λ phage clones utilizing the cre-lox systems. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy termination method using Thermo SequenaseTM (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was prepared from adrenal glands, whole brains, hearts, kidneys, livers, skeletal muscles, spleens, and testes of C57BL/6 mice using Trizol reagent as described above. The RNA preparations (10 ॖg) were subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (24Mukai K. Mitani F. Agake R. Ishimura Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Before transfer to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Diagnostics), ribosomal RNAs were visualized by ethidium bromide to verify that the amounts of RNA loaded were comparable with each other (<157) and that degradation of the RNA preparations was undetectable under our experimental conditions. A cDNA fragment (position 1490–1810 of Fig.1A) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and High Prime (Roche Diagnostics). Hybridization signals were detected with a Kodak BioMax film with an intensifying screen. Genomic DNA was prepared from the liver of CL57BL/6 mice and was digested with EcoRI,BamHI, and HindIII. The digests (10 ॖg) were subjected to electrophoresis through 0.87 agarose and blotted on a positive charged nylon filter (Roche Diagnostics). A cDNA fragment of AZ-1 (position 1490–1810) was isolated and labeled with DIG-dUTP (Roche Diagnostics). Hybridization, stringent washing, and detection with color development were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics) and as described previously (29Mukai K. Imai M. Shimada H. Okada Y. Ogishima T. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Mukai K. Imai M. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9130-9137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To construct a plasmid for expression of recombinant proteins, oligonucleotide primers for PCR were prepared. A forward primer including the putative translational initiation codon was designed to contain an artificial BstXI site at position 48 of the sequence shown in Fig. 1A: 5′-CGCCAGTGTGCTGGAGGCACCATGTGGGGATGT-3′. A reverse PCR primer corresponding to the C terminus of the protein was designed to contain the sequence encoding FLAG epitope followed by an XbaI site: 5′-GCTCTAGACTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTGGTGCCCCATGTCCTCC-3′. Another reverse PCR primer 5′-GCTCTAGATCAGTGGTGCCCCATGTCCTCC-3′ lacking the FLAG tag sequence was also designed. cDNA fragments (either the presence or absence of the FLAG sequence) that were amplified by PCR were inserted into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). To avoid incorrect nucleotides incorporated in PCR, the DraIII fragment (position 69–1280 of Fig. 1A) carrying the PCR-amplified region was replaced by the authentic fragment prepared from the original cDNA. The resulting pR/C11.13FD1 and pR/C11.13D1 plasmids were used for templates in in vitrotranscription-translation reaction of T7 TnT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). Reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Detection was carried out by autoradiography or immunoblotting using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) as described below. Peptides P1 (NH2-Cys-Ser-Gln-Gly-Arg-Pro-Glu-Gln-Tyr-Arg-Arg-His-Gly-Thr-COOH) and P2 (NH2-Cys-Gly-Arg-Val-Gly-Met-Glu-Asp-Met-Gly-His-His-COOH), corresponding to amino acid residues 386–398 and 456–466, respectively, were synthesized and each conjugated at the additional Cys residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) through a thioether bond using maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) as described in the instruction manual. The peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates were mixed (1:1 (w/w)) and emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected into IsaBrown hens 6 times intradermally at 2-week intervals. Blood was collected on the 35th day or thereafter. Antibodies were purified from antisera (10 ml) with a peptide-conjugated agarose gel column. The agarose gel was prepared by coupling a 1:1 (w/w) mixture of the two peptides using a SulfoLink coupling gel (Pierce) according to the instructions. Based on titration by an immunoblot analysis using a recombinant AZ-1 protein, the recovery of the purified antibody after the chromatography was ∼707. The EcoRI-BamHI fragment (position 1490–1810 of Fig. 1A) of the isolated cDNA clone was subcloned into pZL1 (Invitrogen). Mouse cDNAs encoding Cyp11b-1 (position 761–950) or Cyp11b-2 (761–953) (31Domalik L.J. Chaplin D.D. Kirkman M.S. Wu R.C. Liu W.W. Howard T.A. Seldin M.F. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) were obtained by PCR with primer pairs as described previously (25Mukai K. Nagasawa H. Agake-Suzuki R. Mitani F. Totani K. Yanai N. Obinata M. Suematsu M. Ishimura Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) from the total RNA of Y-1 cells after reverse transcription, and they were cloned into pGEM4-Z (Promega). DIG-labeled antisense and sense RNA probes were synthesized with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases, respectively, using DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). Mouse adrenals were excised after transcardial perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline(−) containing 47 paraformaldehyde and were further fixed with the same fixative overnight at 4 °C. The adrenals were embedded with paraffin, and 4-ॖm sections were prepared using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated glass slides. After deparaffinization with standard methods, in situhybridization was carried out as described previously (17Mitani F. Mukai K. Miyamoto H. Suematsu M. Ishimura Y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3342-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the antisense and sense probes (400 ng/ml) in the hybridization solutions were adjusted based on analysis by the agarose gel electrophoresis of the synthesized RNA. Paraffin sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed mouse adrenal glands were treated with affinity-purified chicken anti-AZ-1 antibody (10 ॖg/ml) or control chicken IgY (10 ॖg/ml, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The concentrations of the antibodies were adjusted after protein determination with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The secondary antibody used was rabbit anti-chicken IgY antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:300; Promega). The peroxidase activity was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and hydrogen peroxide as described previously (32Ogishima T. Suzuki H. Hata J. Mitani F. Ishimura Y. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2971-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). pR/C11.13FD1, which was the same DNA construct as used for in vitro synthesis of FLAG-tagged AZ-1 (AZ-1F), or a control vector pRc/CMV was linearized by digestion withBglII. Y-1 cells (3 × 106) were transfected with the linearized DNA (10 ॖg) by calcium phosphate precipitation method using the Profection kit (Promega). The cells were selected for resistance to antibiotics G418 (400 ॖg/ml), and colonies were isolated and expanded for characterization as described below. A mock transfectant (clone 9) and an AZ-1F vector-transfectant (clone 14; see Fig.7), which showed the highest level of AZ-1F mRNA, were used for detection of the AZ-1 polypeptide. Cell extracts from them (3.6-cm2 well) were prepared with an SDS sample buffer (120 ॖl) consisting of 62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 27 (w/v) SDS, 27 (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.017 bromphenol blue. The extracts were incubated at 100 °C for 5 min before electrophoresis. For immunoprecipitation, purified chicken anti-AZ-1 antibody (150 ॖl) was bound to anti-chicken IgY-agarose (150 ॖl of 507 suspension;Promega) by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The beads were washed with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) 5 times. The supernatants of the used culture media (1 ml) were prepared by centrifugation to remove cells and cell debris and incubated with 30 ॖl of the gel suspension for 18 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The agarose gel beads were washed with TBS containing 0.17 Tween 20 (TBST) 4 times followed by a wash with TBS. They were resuspended in an SDS sample buffer and treated at 100 °C for 5 min. The immunoprecipitates and the cell extracts were subjected to 107 PAGE in the presence of SDS, and polypeptides were electrophoretically blotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) according to standard procedures. The membranes were treated with anti-FLAG monoclonal M2 antibody (0.88 ॖg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. They were washed with TBST and then incubated with a secondary antibody solution of rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:25,000 dilution with TBST) for 3 h at room temperature. When the affinity-purified chicken anti-AZ-1 antibody (1:200 dilution) was used for immunoblotting, membranes were treated with rabbit anti-chicken IgY conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution). Bound secondary antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). An AZ-1F-vector transfectant (clone 14) was cultured in the presence of 10 ॖg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) or vehicle (0.27 (v/v) methanol in the culture medium) for 18 h, and cell extracts were prepared as described above. For treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F, cell extracts of the transfectant containing 27 SDS were diluted by 10-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated with 50 units/ml of N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) at 37 °C for 18 h. After the treatment, the SDS sample buffer was added to the reaction mixtures. These samples were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. RT-PCR analysis was performed by the methods as described in the previous paper (25Mukai K. Nagasawa H. Agake-Suzuki R. Mitani F. Totani K. Yanai N. Obinata M. Suematsu M. Ishimura Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using primer pairs as follows: (i) AZ-1F: 64f, 5′-ACCATGTGGGGATGTTGGCTGG-3′ (position 64–85, see Fig.1A) and FL1485r, 5′-GTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCG-3′ that corresponds to the FLAG peptide encoding sequence); (ii) AZ-1: 420f, 5′-GGACAACTGCAATCGATGCACC-3′ (420–441); 1003r, 5′-GGCTGTGCATCATACAACGAGG-3′ (1003–982); this primer pair was used for detection of mRNA of both endogenous Az-1 gene and AZ-1F; (iii) Cyp11b-1 (25Mukai K. Nagasawa H. Agake-Suzuki R. Mitani F. Totani K. Yanai N. Obinata M. Suematsu M. Ishimura Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); (iv) Cyp11a (25Mukai K. Nagasawa H. Agake-Suzuki R. Mitani F. Totani K. Yanai N. Obinata M. Suematsu M. Ishimura Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); and (v) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (25Mukai K. Nagasawa H. Agake-Suzuki R. Mitani F. Totani K. Yanai N. Obinata M. Suematsu M. Ishimura Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Amplification conditions for PCR were 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 56 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for appropriate cycle numbers followed by 7 min at 72 °C. Cycle numbers were 20 for AZ-1 (420f and 1003r), Cyp11a, and GAPDH and 25 for AZ-1F (64f and FL1485r), and Cyp11b-1. Experiments for comparison of relative amounts of mRNAs among the transfectants were performed within the exponential phase of the amplification reactions to obtain the linear response concerning the initial mRNA amounts. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by visualization with ethidium bromide. Intensities of the visualized products were determined by densitometric analysis and were normalized with that of GAPDH cDNA. For the subtractive cDNA cloning to identify genes whose transcripts are expressed in higher levels in undifferentiated adrenocortical cells than in differentiated cells, we prepared two probes as described under “Experimental Procedures”; one was obtained by a subtraction between AcA101 and AcA201 and the other was between AcA101 and Y-1. A cDNA library of AcA101 cells was prepared to represent the whole population of mRNA molecules. It was screened by hybridization of the two subtracted probes onto plaque lifts. We isolated cDNA clones whose hybridization signal was detected with both subtractive probes. Among the cDNA clones isolated, one was composed of 1926 nucleotides except for a poly(A) tail as shown in Fig.1A. The cDNA attracted our attention because the amino acid sequence of its encoded protein had a unique structure as described below. The protein was termed as AZ-1 since its expression level was inversely related to the degree of the functional differentiation of adrenocortical cells as described below. The cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide chain consisting of 466 amino acids, which was from a translational initiation codon at position 67 to a termination codon at position 1465. Several nucleotides preceding the methionine codon were consistent with the consensus sequence for translational initiation (33Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). A typical polyadenylation signal was found at position 1907. The N-terminal 17-amino acid sequence was predictable as a signal peptide for the secretory pathway (34von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). No hydrophobic region large enough to span a membrane was recognized. Possible N-glycosylation sites were present at Asn-77 and Asn-160. These features in the predicted amino acid sequence suggest that AZ-1 is a secretory protein. When searched in the GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ data base, the predicted amino acid sequence of the open reading frame had an identity of 897 with human tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen-related protein (TIN-ag-RP) (35Wex T. Lipyansky A. Bromme N.C. Wex H. Guan X.Q. Bromme D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1350-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), indicating that the identified cDNA encodes a mouse orthologue of the human protein. As Wexet al. (35Wex T. Lipyansky A. Bromme N.C. Wex H. Guan X.Q. Bromme D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1350-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) discussed the features of amino acid sequence of TIN-ag-RP, the N-terminal one-third of AZ-1 polypeptide was rich in Cys residues and contained EGF-like repeats. The C-terminal two-thirds of AZ-1 polypeptide contained procathepsin B-related sequence with a Ser residue at position 228, which replaced a conserved Cys residue in the active site of cysteine proteinases (Fig. 1A), suggesting that AZ-1 does not have a proteinase activity. These structural features were also found in tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen (TIN-ag) (36Nelson T.R. Charonis A.S. McIvor R.S. Butkowski R.J. J. Biol.

To verify the size of the polypeptide encoded by the isolated cDNA, we carried out in vitro synthesis of AZ-1 using its cDNA as a template for a coupled transcription and translation reaction in the presence of [35S]Met (Fig.2A, left). As seen, the reaction with the cDNA insert (lane 2) gave a major product with an electrophoretic mobility of 46 kDa, which matched with the predicted molecular mass of the encoded protein. We also constructed a DNA encoding the AZ-1 polypeptide tagged with a FLAG peptide at the C terminus. The resulting FLAG-tagged polypeptide, AZ-1F, showed a band with a mobility of 47 kDa (lane 3). The increase of 1 kDa in molecular mass was consistent with an addition of the FLAG peptide of 8 amino acid residues to the native polypeptide. Additional bands with higher mobilities might be polypeptides where internal Met residues were used for translational initiation. The reaction with the control vector gave no signal under the experimental conditions (lane 1). Transcription-translation reaction products in the absence of radioactive amino acids were examined by immunoblotting employing an anti-"

The ectodomain of gp190 is among the most complex in the hematopoietin receptor family, because it contains two typical cytokine receptor homology domains separated by an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain. Human and murine gp190 proteins share 76% homology, but murine gp190 binds human LIF with a much higher affinity, a property attributed to the Ig-like domain. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the Ig-like domain, we mapped a LIF binding site at its carboxyl terminus, mainly involving residue Phe-328. Mutation of selected residues into their orthologs in the murine receptor (Q251E and N321D) significantly increased the affinity for human LIF. Interestingly, these residues, although localized at both the amino and carboxyl terminus, make a spatially unique LIF binding site in a structural model of the Ig-like module. These results demonstrate definitively the role of the Ig-like domain in LIF binding and the potential to modulate receptor affinity in this family with very limited amino acid changes.

The extracellular region of gp190 is unusual in that it has two CRH domains, herein called D1 for the amino-terminal membrane distal domain and D2 for the membrane proximal domain. D1 and D2 are separated by an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) module of around 100 amino acids, and D2 is followed by three type III fibronectin modules (1Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandeBos T. Gimpel S.D.

The gp190 receptor participates in the high affinity receptor complex for 5 human cytokines (reviewed in Ref. 2Bravo J. Heath J.K.

The gp190 also exists in a soluble form capable of binding to LIF, behaving as a competitor of membrane gp190 and as an inhibitor of LIF's biological effects. Little information relative to the function of each module of gp190 is available to date. The CRH domain is usually implicated in binding to the ligand, and for this reason has been called the cytokine binding domain. The function of the Ig-like module is less clear. In some cases, it has also directly participated in ligand binding. Indeed the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus-derived interleukin (IL)-6 (vIL-6) homolog directly binds to the Ig-like domain of its unique receptor chain gp130 (3Chow D. He X. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), this latter being also the high affinity converting chain for the LIF/gp190 complex. Similarly, human OSM interacts with both the CRH and the Ig-like domains of its low affinity receptor chain gp130 (4Staunton D. Hudson K.R. Heath J.K. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the Ig-like module of gp130 does not directly interact with the human cytokine IL-6, but is required when two gp80/IL-6/gp130 complexes dimerize to form the signal transducing hexamer (5Chow D. Ho J. Nguyen Pham T.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7593-7603Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As a final example, the Ig-like domain of the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor has also been reported to participate in the dimerization of two receptor chains triggered by the ligand (6Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Asakura A. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25928-25934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and also directly to ligand binding (7Layton J.E. Hall N.E. Connell F. Venhorst J. Treutlein H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36779-36787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). With respect to human gp190 (hgp190), we ascribed to the Ig-like module the role of a hinge allowing the two CRH domains to interact with each other (8Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F.

Moreau J.F. Taupin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13682-13692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). On the other hand, murine gp190 (mLIFR), which shares 76% sequence homology with hgp190, displays a much higher affinity for human LIF (hLIF) than hgp190 does (10Layton M.J. Lock P. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17048-17055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This could be reproduced by the replacement of the Ig-like module of hgp190 with its murine homolog (11Owczarek C.M. Zhang Y. Layton M.J. Metcalf D. Roberts B. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23976-23985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, when analyzing a series of deletion mutants lacking one or several modules of the hgp190 ectodomain, we identified a mutation in the carboxyl terminus of the Ig-like module (mutation 002, i.e. F328T/A329S), which led to a dramatic decrease of hLIF binding (8Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Given these preliminary results, we decided to investigate more precisely the role of the Ig-like module of hgp190 in binding to hLIF. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed, and the single point mutants generated were expressed as soluble and membrane-bound forms. They were analyzed for their ability to bind hLIF and trigger LIF-dependent proliferation. In a first series of mutants the residues of the carboxyl terminus of the Ig-like module were mutated into alanine to identify residues involved in hLIF binding. In a second series of mutants, selected residues in the Ig-like module of the human receptor were mutated into their orthologs in the murine protein, in an attempt to identify residues responsible for the difference in affinity between both species for hLIF. All eukaryotic cell lines were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) for COS and CHO DUCKX cells or RPMI 1640 medium for Ba/F3 cells, in the presence of 8% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 2 mml-glutamine. For CHO DUCKX cells 10 μg/ml of adenosine, deoxyadenosine, and thymidine were added to the medium. Ba/F3 transfectants were grown in the presence of hLIF at 50 ng/ml. For functional studies, the cells were first starved of hLIF for 3 days by culture in medium supplemented with murine IL-3 (mIL-3) in the form of a COS cell supernatant diluted 1:200 and then washed three times to remove mIL-3. Site-directed mutagenesis of the extracellular region of hgp190 (soluble hgp190 or shgp190) was performed using the pAlter-1 phagemid system (Promega, Charbonnières, France) following the manufacturer's recommendations as previously described (8Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutational oligonucleotides were synthesized (Cybergene, Evry, France) that allowed for the creation of the desired mutation together with a new restriction site, or the inactivation of an existing one wherever possible, in order to allow for easy screening of the mutated plasmids. All punctual shgp190 mutants were subcloned in the pEDr vector, either as a carboxyl-terminal c-Myc-tagged soluble receptor (shgp190myc) or fused to the transmembrane and intracellular region of hgp130 (hgp190/130 chimeras) as previously described (8Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The mutants created were all verified by sequencing (ESGS, Evry, France). COS cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the shgp190myc constructs using the DEAE-dextran method as previously described (8Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants were collected at day 4, and the recombinant receptor was quantitated by ELISA. Stable transfectants were obtained by electroporating CHO DUCKX DHFR(−) cells with the cDNAs encoding the soluble receptors and selecting the transfectants in nucleoside-free medium based on the DHFR gene carried by the pEDr plasmid. For stable expression of the transmembrane forms of hgp190 mutants in Ba/F3 cells, the chimeric receptors were cotransfected by electroporation into Ba/F3 cells in the presence of wild-type hgp130 cDNA. Transfected cells were selected in the presence of G418 (Invitrogen) and by progressive replacement of mIL-3 by hLIF as previously described (8Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S.

The membrane expression of the hgp130 and of the hgp190 mutants on the Ba/F3 cell lines was detected by flow cytometry using the anti-D1 mAb 6G8 and the anti-D2 mAbs 8C2 and 12D3 for hgp190 (12Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F. Cransac M. Jollet I. Vernallis A. Hudson K. Godard A. Jacques Y. Moreau J.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and using the anti-hgp130 mAbs AM64 and H1 for hgp130. An IgG1 irrelevant isotype-matched mAb was used as a negative control. The staining was performed as previously reported (8Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and was analyzed with a three color FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD PharMingen) equipped with the CellQuest software. To analyze the turnover of the transmembrane form of the LIF receptor or its mutants from the cell surface, the indicated Ba/F3 cell lines were incubated with hLIF at 100 ng/ml or without any added cytokine for the indicated times at 37 °C, before being stained with the anti-hgp190 8C2 mAb or an isotype-matched negative control mAb. Secreted shgp190myc and its mutants were quantitated using a sandwich ELISA specific for hgp190, according to the previously reported procedure (12Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F.

Aubard Y. Praloran V. Moreau J.F. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1998; 9: 599-605PubMed Google Scholar). The capture mAb was the anti-D1 mAb 6G8, and the biotinylated developing mAb was the anti-D2 mAb 8C2. In vitro hLIF binding to shgp190myc or its mutants was assessed as follows. All steps were performed at room temperature, and plate washes were performed in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. ELISA plates were coated with the anti-D1 mAb 6G8, and saturated with PBS/BSA for 1 h. Plates were washed once and then incubated with supernatants containing shgp190myc or its point mutants adjusted at a constant and saturating concentration of 150 ng/ml for 2 h and washed three times. Some of the mutants with lower secretion levels were concentrated to reach 150 ng/ml using polyethylene glycol 35000 (Fluka, Sigma). CHO-derived hLIF ranging from 0.256 ng/ml to 4000 ng/ml was added for 2 h. After three washes, plates were incubated with the biotinylated non-blocking anti-hLIF mAb 1F10 (14Taupin J.L. Acres B. Dott K. Schmitt D. Kieny M.P. Gualde N. Moreau J.F. Scand. J. Immunol. 1993; 38: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for 1.5 h and washed again three times. Subsequent steps, i.e. incubation of peroxidase-labeled streptavidin and addition of substrate were as described for the ELISA for quantification of shgp190. The proliferative response to hLIF, mLIF, hOSM, and mIL-3 of the transfected Ba/F3 cell line was assessed by a colorimetric proliferation assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma), after 3 days of culture, as described previously (8Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To analyze the inhibitory activity of the soluble receptor toward hLIF action, we used Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type full-length hgp190 and hgp130. A mixture of hLIF (1 ng/ml final concentration) and shgp190myc or soluble mutant Q251E/N321D at the indicated final concentrations, or murine serum as a source of mouse LIF receptor (mLIFR) at the indicated final dilutions, was added to the cells. Cell proliferation was analyzed 3 days later. Whenever specified, cell culture medium was also supplemented with extra amounts of soluble receptors on day 1 and day 2. The purified anti-D1 mAb 10B2 (5 mg) was coupled to a 1-ml Hi-Trap-NHS-activated column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Culture supernatant (500 ml) of CHO cells stably producing the recombinant soluble receptor was passed through the column. After washing with 5 ml of PBS at pH 7.5 containing 1 m KCl and 0.02% Tween 20, bound receptor was eluted with 0.1 m glycine at pH 2.5 as 1-ml fractions, and acidity was immediately neutralized with a one-third volume of Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. After extensive dialysis against PBS, the receptor was quantitated by ELISA, and the fractions with the highest concentrations were pooled. Stably transfected Ba/F3 cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of mIL-3 instead of hLIF. After one PBS wash, cells were resuspended in PBS/BSA with or without the blocking anti-hgp130 B-R3 mAb (20 μg/ml) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Binding experiments were carried out in PBS/BSA for experiments using labeled Escherichia coli-derived hLIF (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ), or in PBS/BSA containing 5 mm mannose-6-phosphate for experiments using CHO-derived hLIF, to avoid binding to the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (Man 6-P/IGFII-R) (15Blanchard F. Raher S. Duplomb L. Vusio P. Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Moreau J.F. Hoflack B. Minvielle S. Jacques Y. Godard A. J. Biol.

Anegon I. Peyrat M.A. Le Mauff B. Mouray E. Gregoire M. Virdee K. Soulillou J.P. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3214-3222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at a specific radioactivity of around 35,000 cpm/fmol. Regression analysis of the binding data was accomplished using a one- or two-site equilibrium binding equation (Grafit, Erathicus Software, Staines, UK). These experiments were performed with the BIACore 2000 optical biosensor (BIACore, Uppsala, Sweden). hLIF purified from transfected CHO cells was covalently coupled to a carboxymethyl dextran flow cell (CM5, BIACore) as recommended by the manufacturer. The level of immobilization obtained was 1,500 resonance units. Binding of purified CHO-derived soluble receptors was assayed at concentrations ranging from 0.67 to 33 nm in Hepes-buffered saline and at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. Association was monitored for 5 min before initiating the dissociation phase for another 11 min with Hepes-buffered saline. Regeneration of the flow cells was achieved with 5 mm glycine-HCl at pH 2.0. The resulting sensorgrams were analyzed using the BIAEvaluation software (BIACore). Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type hgp190 and hgp130 were used. CHO-derived hLIF at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml giving maximal STAT3 phosphorylation was incubated with or without the purified soluble receptors, or with normal mouse serum as a source of mLIFR, at twice the indicated concentrations at 37 °C for 20 min, before the cells (2 × 105 per condition tested) were added in an identical volume. After 5 min at 37 °C, the cells were lysed in 50 μl of Triton X-100 lysis buffer as described previously (9Voisin M.B. Bitard J. Daburon S. Moreau J.F. Taupin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13682-13692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the supernatant was harvested, and the total protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma). The cell lysate (10 μg of protein/lane) was boiled 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoblotting was performed as previously reported (9Voisin M.B. Bitard J. Daburon S. Moreau J.F. Taupin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13682-13692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with the rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Ozyme, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France) or with the rabbit anti-actin antibody (Sigma) as a control. The proteins were visualized using the chemiluminescence ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). A structural model of the Ig-like domain of hgp190 was constructed using the program MODELLER (18Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar) using a sequence alignment of the Ig-like domain of hgp130 with the corresponding region of hgp190 and the crystallographic coordinates of the Ig-like domain of hgp130 (PDB accession number: 1I1R, Ref. 3Chow D. He X. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The quality of the model was assessed using ProsaII. In order to elucidate the role of the Ig domain in LIF binding, the region of hgp190 around mutation 002 (8Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which abrogates its binding, was subjected to alanine-scanning site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1 A). A total of 12 mutations were carried out extending from residues 321 to 334, except for the existing alanine at position 329, which was mutated to glycine (Fig. 1 B). Since the junction between the Ig-like module and D2 lies between residues 330 and 331, as inferred from the analysis of intron-exon organization of the hgp190 gene (1Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandeBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), 8 mutations were therefore localized in the Ig-like module and 4 were in the D2 domain (Fig. 1 B). Additionally, we also replaced 6 amino acids in the human sequence of the Ig-like module by their murine orthologs as deduced from the alignment of the sequences from both species (Matcher® Program, Ref. 19Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 373-381Crossref Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Among these, 4 affected residues close to mutation 002 (i.e. N321D, I322V, F323Y, and I327V), and 2 affected residues localized in the amino terminus of the Ig-like module (i.e. Q251E and D266N) were chosen by virtue of electrostatic charge changes between both species (Fig. 1 B). A double mutant Q251E/N321D was also constructed. The cDNAs for shgp190 and its mutants were fused carboxyl-terminal to the sequence encoding the c-Myc epitope recognized by mAb 9E10. To examine whether the resulting proteins were correctly produced and released in the cell culture supernatant, each cDNA construct was transiently expressed in COS cells, and the secreted receptor was quantitated with a sandwich ELISA specific for hgp190 using mAbs 6G8 and 8C2, which are directed against D1 and D2, respectively. We used mAbs specific for epitopes outside the Ig-like domain to ensure that their reactivity could not be affected by the mutations. In addition, these mAbs recognize conformation-dependent epitopes (12Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F. Cransac M. Jollet I. Vernallis A. Hudson K. Godard A. Jacques Y. Moreau J.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), giving information on the ternary conformation of the secreted receptor. All the hgp190 mutants were expressed at levels grossly comparable to that of shgp190myc, which was produced at 161 ± 42 ng/ml, albeit mutants 002, F328A, A329G, G330A, Y331A, P332A, P333A, and D334A were at approximately 2–4-fold lower levels. 2J. Bitard and J.-L. Taupin, unpublished data. To determine the relative hLIF binding abilities of shgp190myc and its mutants, we developed an ELISA to detect the ligand/low affinity receptor complex in solution. Each mutant at a saturating concentration was trapped on a microtitration plate coated with the mAb 6G8 directed at the D1 domain. Serial dilutions of hLIF were then added, and hLIF bound to the receptor was detected with biotinylated anti-hLIF mAb 1F10, a mAb that does not affect hLIF binding (20Taupin J.L. Gualde N. Moreau J.F. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A(left panel) displays the dose-response curves obtained with representative mutants V326A, F328A, G330A, and P332A. For shgp190myc, 50% of the maximal binding (C50) was reached with hLIF at 14.0 ± 3.2 ng/ml (mean ± S.D. of three experiments), corresponding to 0.35 ± 0.08 nm given that the molecular mass of CHO-derived hLIF is 40 kDa. The C50 obtained for all the mutants are listed in Fig. 2 A (right panel) and compared (in percent) to the C50 value obtained with shgp190myc. Alanine mutants could be sorted into two groups. A first group contained mutants N321A, A329G, Y331A, P332A, P333A, and D334A, each displaying an ability to bind hLIF close to that of shgp190myc (C50 ratio between 50 and 120%). A second group consisted of F323A, T325A, V326A, I327A, F328A, 002, and G330A, each showing a severely impaired ability to bind hLIF (C50 ratio of 10% and lower). Among these, no hLIF binding could be detected at all for mutants 002 and F328A (indicated by two asterisks in Fig. 2 A and shown with mutant F328A in the left panel) even at the highest hLIF concentration tested (4000 ng/ml). In contrast, a faint binding could be detected at high concentrations of hLIF for mutants F323A, T325A, V326A, I327A, and G330A (indicated byone asterisk in Fig. 2 A and shown for mutant G330A in the left panel). Mutations that impaired hLIF binding were all localized in the Ig-like domain, because none of the mutations generated downstream of the Ig-like/D2 junction altered hLIF binding. The human-to-mouse mutants could be sorted into three groups (Fig.2 B). Mutant D266N displayed the same hLIF binding ability as shgp190myc, whereas I322V, F323Y, and I327V showed a decreased binding. A third group consisted of Q251E, N321D, and the double mutant Q251E/N321D, which all possessed a significantly increased hLIF binding ability, with respectively 7, 14, and 35 times that of wild-type shgp190myc. There was no correlation between the production levels of the mutants in the cell culture supernatants and their ability to bind hLIF, strongly suggesting that the mutations performed did not alter the conformation of the receptors or not to an extent that could impair their function. To analyze the ability of the hgp190 single point mutants to trigger a LIF-dependent signal, the c-Myc tag of the mutants was replaced with the transmembrane and intracellular regions of hgp130, and mIL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells were transfected with wild-type hgp130 and either each of the mutants or a chimeric non-mutated hgp190/130 as a positive control. Stable cell lines were obtained with all the mutants. In contrast, transfection of hgp130 or hgp190/130 alone never allowed the selection of cells in the presence of hLIF. Membrane expression of the receptor chains was analyzed by flow cytometry. Fig. 3 A depicts the staining of the parental Ba/F3 cell line, the hgp190/130 cell line, and three representative Ba/F3 cell lines bearing hgp130 in combination with either F328A, G330A, or P332A chimeric mutants of hgp190. The expression level of the receptor chains may vary from one transfection experiment to another, but the variations observed were not associated with particular mutations. All the transfectants obtained were then tested for their ability to proliferate in the presence of hLIF and hOSM. Dose-response proliferation curves are shown in Fig. 3 B for the representative mutants F328A, G330A, P332A, and the hgp190/130 control cell line. Cytokine concentrations giving half-maximum proliferation (EC50) are given in Table I. All the cell lines proliferated in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of hLIF (Table I and Fig. 3 B,left panel). The non-mutated hgp190/130 receptor supported Ba/F3 cell proliferation with an EC50 of 0.18 ± 0.05 ng/ml, i.e. 4.5 ± 1.25 pm. As expected, the mutations leading to conserved hLIF binding ability in the ELISA also behaved like the non-mutated receptor in the Ba/F3 proliferation assay (see mutant P332A in Fig. 3 B). Mutation F328A, which led to complete abrogation of hLIF binding ability in the ELISA resulted in a sharp (80–100-fold) decrease in Ba/F3 cells proliferation in the presence of hLIF (EC50 of 18.67 ± 6 ng/ml), and fully accounted for the decrease observed with mutation 002 (EC50 of 16.38 ± 4.7 ng/ml). In contrast, mutations that only partially impaired hLIF binding in the ELISA had no influence on cellular proliferation, as shown for mutant G330A in Fig. 3 B. The proliferation curves presented depict a representative experiment, and the apparent differences in response to hLIF, which can be seen between the mutants, are not biologically significant with the exception of mutant F328A (see also Table I). The cell transfectants did not proliferate at all in the absence of added cytokine and proliferated comparably in the presence of mIL-3, demonstrating that their intrinsic ability to proliferate was fully retained after transfection.2 All the Ba/F3 cell lines also proliferated in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of hOSM (Fig. 3 B, middle panel for representative mutants and Table I), and no difference was noted between all the mutants and the hgp190/130 cell line (EC50of 2.02 ± 0.37 ng/ml, i.e. 100 ± 18 pm). Of note, mutation F328A had no effect on the response to hOSM. The response to mLIF was also analyzed for the F328A cell line and the hgp190/130 cell line (Fig. 3 B,right panel and Table I). As with hLIF, mutation F328A also strongly impaired the response to mLIF, and the barely detectable residual activity did not allow the calculation of the EC50for mLIF. Therefore, residue Phe-328, which is conserved between the human and mouse species, is crucial for binding both human and murine LIF.Table IAbility of the alanine mutants of gp190 in a membrane form to trigger hLIF-,hOSM-, and mLIF-dependent proliferation of Ba/F3 cell linesCell linesEC50hLIFhOSMmLIFng/ml1-aCytokine concentration giving 50% maximal proliferative response, mean ± S.D. of three experiments.gp190/1300.18 ± 0.052.02 ± 0.3737.00 ± 5.60N321A0.15 ± 0.062.22 ± 0.01F323A0.16 ± 0.012.70 ± 0.88T325A0.17 ± 0.052.02 ± 0.35V326A0.19 ± 0.032.50 ± 0.20I327A0.27 ±"

Although there is evidence to the contrary, electron microscopic studies showing that ligand binding triggers α- and औ-subunit dissociation in the integrin headpiece have gained popularity and support the hypothesis that head separation activates integrins. To test directly the head separation hypothesis, we enforced head association by introducing disulfide bonds across the interface between the α-subunit औ-propeller domain and the औ-subunit I-like domain. Basal and activation-dependent ligand binding by αIIbऔ3 and αVऔ3 was unaffected. The covalent linkage prevented dissociation of αIIbऔ3 into its subunits on EDTA-treated cells. Whereas EDTA dissociated wild type αIIbऔ3 on the cell surface, a ligand-mimetic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide did not, as judged by binding of complex-specific antibodies. Finally, a high affinity ligand-mimetic compound stabilized noncovalent association between αIIband औ3 headpiece fragments in the presence of SDS, indicating that ligand binding actually stabilized subunit association at the head, as opposed to the suggested subunit separation. The mechanisms of conformational regulation of integrin function should therefore be considered in the context of the associated αऔ headpiece.

They mediate cell-extracellular matrix as well as cell-cell adhesion, connect extracellular cues to the cytoskeleton, and activate many intracellular signaling pathways (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9007) Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6868) Google Scholar). One unique aspect of integrins is that the affinity of their extracellular domain for biological ligands can be rapidly up-regulated by signals from within the cell. Rapid and precise control of integrin activation is particularly important for leukocytes and platelets, which circulate in the vascular system, where leukocyte emigration and thrombus formation mediated by integrins must be triggered only at the appropriate location. Integrins compose two noncovalently associated type I transmembrane glycoprotein α- and औ-subunits (3Takagi J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the integrin αVऔ3 revealed a bent conformation, in which there is an acute angle between the headpiece and tailpiece (4Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar), and an extensive headpiece-tailpiece interface (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the bent conformation represents the low affinity receptor and that activation is associated with a switchblade-like motion of the headpiece resulting in a highly extended conformation (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The integrin headpiece contains the ligand-binding site. The headpiece contains the α-subunit औ-propeller and thigh domains and the औ-subunit I-like and hybrid domains (Fig. 1), corresponding approximately to the N-terminal two-thirds of the extracellular domain of each subunit. A crystal structure with a bound ligand-mimetic peptide revealed that ligand binds to an interface formed by the औ-subunit I-like domain and औ-sheets 2–4 of the α-subunit औ-propeller domain (6Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Many experiments support the idea that the inter-subunit association at the cytoplasmic region maintains integrins in low affinity state (7Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A.

Originally, this notion led to a “hinge hypothesis,” where association/dissociation of the cytoplasmic tails caused hinging between the two subunits, and ultimately changed the conformation of the ligand-binding extracellular segments (11O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the conformational change that regulates ligand binding by integrins has been controversial (2Hynes R.O.

These images suggested a wide separation in the headpiece, with no interaction remaining between the N-terminal halves of the α- and औ-subunits. These observations have been highly influential, in part because they seemed to fit with earlier schematics of integrin activation models where a hinge-like motion at the transmembrane domains is transmitted through rigid α- and औ-subunit tailpiece segments to the headpiece, resulting in movement apart of the α- and औ-subunits in the headpiece (11O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 12Plow E.F. Haas T.A.

Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent high resolution negative stain EM studies have shown that the α-subunit leg can exist in two distinct conformations with respect to the headpiece and that the औ-subunit leg is highly flexible (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Existence of multiple modular domains (4Xiong J.-P. Stehle T.

Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) also disfavors rigid movement of the entire stalk region. Because the legs are flexible, it is hard to imagine that information can be transmitted to the headpiece as proposed in the hinge model. Furthermore, high resolution EM studies (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), as well as many other EM studies (19Erb E.M. Tangemann K. Bohrmann B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have shown that ligand binding to integrins is not accompanied by head separation. There are other reasons for the popularity of the head separation model. First, it has been suggested that residues that have been implicated in ligand binding are buried in the headpiece and that separation could expose them, resulting in higher affinity binding (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6868) Google Scholar). Second, there is the mystery of the synergy site in fibronectin type III module 9 of fibronectin, which is distant from the RGD site in module 10. It has been proposed that separation of the headpiece (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6868) Google Scholar,15Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) would facilitate simultaneous binding of the α-subunit to the synergy site and the औ-subunit to the RGD site (23Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the liganded αVऔ3 crystal structure shows that the Arg of RGD binds to the α-subunit and the Asp of RGD binds to the औ-subunit (6Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that headpiece separation would disrupt binding to RGD. Third, there are structural homologies between integrins and G proteins (4Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 24Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C.

A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). By taking this analogy further, it has been suggested that upon integrin activation, the औ-propeller and I-like domains might dissociate analogously to the G protein औ- and α-subunits (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6868) Google Scholar, 15Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). An alternative model for integrin activation has been proposed that is supported by high resolution EM, physicochemical studies, ligand binding assays, introduction of disulfide bonds that lock in the bent conformation, and localization of epitopes that become exposed after integrin activation (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 26Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In this model, activation is regulated by the conformational equilibrium between three states as follows: a bent conformation with low affinity, an extended conformation with a closed headpiece with intermediate affinity, and an extended conformation with an open headpiece with high affinity. Binding of RGD peptide was found not to induce head separation but to induce a dramatic change in angle between the औ-subunit I-like and hybrid domains, leading to the swing-out of the hybrid domain away from the α-subunit (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The prominence of the hybrid domain in the interface between the headpiece and the tailpiece in the bent conformation provides a mechanism for linking the change in angle upon ligand binding to the equilibrium between the bent and extended integrin conformations (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Definitive experimental testing of the head separation model is important. Therefore, we have used mutagenesis to introduce disulfide bonds between the α-subunit औ-propeller domain and the औ-subunit I-like domain, and we have tested the effect of preventing head separation on activation of αIIbऔ3 and αVऔ3 integrins on the cell surface. Furthermore, we test the effect of ligand-mimetic compounds on the association between the α- and औ-subunits in native integrins on the cell surface and in soluble integrin fragments that contain only the headpiece. Mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb)1 PT25-2 recognizing human αIIb subunit (27Tokuhira M. Handa M. Kamata T. Oda A. Katayama M. Tomiyama Y. Murata M. Kawai Y. Watanabe K. Ikeda Y. Thromb.

Coller (Rockefeller University, New York). Mouse anti-औ3 AP3 was from American Type Culture Collection. All other mAbs were obtained from the Fifth International Leukocyte Workshop (29Petruzzelli L. Luk J. Springer T.A. Schlossman S.F. Boumsell L. Gilks W. Harlan J. Kishimoto T. Morimoto T. Ritz J. Shaw S. Silverstein R. Springer T. Tedder T. Todd R. Leucocyte Typing V: White Cell Differentiation Antigens. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 1581-1585Google Scholar). Plasmids coding for full-length human αIIb, αV, and औ3 were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) or pEF/V5-HisA as described previously (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Mutants were made using site-directed mutagenesis, and DNA sequences were confirmed before being transfected into 293T cells using calcium phosphate precipitation. Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine as described (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Labeled cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-औ3 AP3, eluted with 0.57 SDS, and subjected to nonreducing or reducing SDS-7.57 PAGE and fluorography. Binding of fluorescein-labeled human fibrinogen and fibronectin were performed as previously described (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). To test the effect of EDTA treatment on mAb epitope expression, transiently transfected 293T cells were preincubated in 20 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.4, containing either 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mmMg2+, or 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by washing and resuspension in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 17 bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mmMg2+ (HBS). Cells were then incubated with mAbs on ice for 30 min, followed by staining with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and flow cytometry. To test the effect of RGD peptide on mAb epitope expression, cells in HBS were incubated with 100 ॖmGRGDSP peptide at room temperature for 30 min before adding mAbs and staining as above. An integrin headpiece fragment comprising αIIb residues 1–621 and औ3 residues 1–472 was produced in Chinese hamster ovary Lec 3.2.8.1 cells stably transfected with plasmids coding for each fragment. Acid-base α-helical coiled-coil peptides were fused to the C termini of the α- and औ-subunits to increase the stability of the heterodimer. Methods were as described previously (8Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A hexahistidine tag was also attached to the C terminus of the औ-subunit to facilitate purification by nickel chelate chromatography (8Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The purified headpiece fragment was treated with 10 ॖg/ml chymotrypsin for 16 h at 25 °C to remove the C-terminal clasp, and incubated with the high affinity RGD-mimetic compound L738,167 (gift from Dr. G. D. Hartman, Merck) (30Prueksaritanont T. Gorham L.M. Naue J.A. Hamill T.G. Askew B.C. Vyas K.P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1997; 25: 355-361PubMed Google Scholar) at 10 ॖm for 30 min at 37 °C. The mixture was cooled to room temperature; an equal volume of sample buffer containing 0.17 SDS was added, and samples were immediately subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE on a 4–207 gradient gel. To make mutant integrins that were unable to undergo head separation, we mutationally introduced cysteine residues at the interface between the αIIb औ-propeller and औ3 I-like domains (Fig. 1). Inspection of the structure of αVऔ3 and a model of αIIbऔ3 made from the αVऔ3 template identified candidate positions for disulfide bonds where Cα distances between औ-propeller and I-like domain residues were within 7 Å. Disulfide-forming efficiency was assessed by transient transfection of 293T cells followed by immunoprecipitation and nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Preliminary experiments revealed that the efficiency varied from 20 to 1007, depending on the combination of residues chosen (data not shown). In αVऔ3, the combination of the αV-M400C and औ3-Q267C mutations gave ∼1007 formation of an intersubunit disulfide bridge as indicated by the formation of a high molecular weight band in nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, compare wild type in lane 1 and double mutant in lane 2), whereas the αV- and औ3-subunits migrated separately in reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). The combination of αV-E311C and औ3-G293C mutations resulted in slightly less efficient disulfide formation (∼707, data not shown). Since αIIb lacks the long loop containing M400 in αV, the mutation corresponding to αV-E311C (αIIb-E324C) was tested and shown to form an efficient disulfide when coupled with the औ3-G293C mutation (Fig. 2, compare lane 6 with wild type in lane 5). Under reducing conditions, the disulfide-linked complex was reduced into individual α- and औ-subunits indistinguishable from the wild type subunits (Fig. 2,lanes 7 and 8). The mutations link औ-propeller blade 5 or the connection between blades 6 and 7 to the I-like domain, whereas the ligand-binding interface locates on the opposite side of the interface where blades 2–4 of the औ-propeller domain contact the I-like domain (Fig. 1). The mutations should therefore not directly affect the ligand-binding site or disrupt conformational changes in loops near the ligand-binding site. A panel of mAbs directed against the head regions of αVऔ3 and αIIbऔ3 bound identically to mutant and wild type receptors (data not shown), suggesting that the mutant receptors adopt a native fold. High affinity binding of αVऔ3 and αIIbऔ3 transfectants to fluorescent, soluble ligands was measured with simultaneous staining of surface-expressed αVऔ3 or αIIbऔ3 using two-color flow cytometry (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). As described previously, wild type αIIbऔ3bound soluble fibrinogen when activated by Mn2+ and activating mAb PT25-2 but not in the absence of activation (Fig.3A). The αIIb-E324C/औ3-G293C mutant could not bind soluble fibrinogen in the resting state but showed full activity when treated with Mn2+ and PT25-2 (Fig. 3A). Thus, the ligand-binding phenotype of αIIbऔ3containing a disulfide-linked headpiece is identical to wild type. Similarly, the mutant αVऔ3 receptor was tested for activation-dependent binding to soluble fibrinogen (Fig. 3B) and fibronectin (Fig. 3C). As for αIIbऔ3, the ligand binding activities of wild type and mutant αVऔ3receptors were indistinguishable. Both showed little or no basal ligand binding and strong binding of both ligands upon activation by Mn2+ and activating mAb AP5 (Fig. 3, B andC). These data show that disulfide bond formation between the औ-propeller and I-like domains has no effect on high affinity ligand binding by औ3 integrins, strongly arguing against the notion that head separation is required for conversion to high affinity. EDTA treatment at pH 8.4 at 37 °C is known to induce dissociation of the integrin αIIbऔ3into the αIIb- and औ3-subunits on the platelet surface (31Brass L.F. Shattil S.J. Kunicki T.J. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7875-7881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Coller B.S. Peerschke E.I. Seligsohn U. Scudder L.E. Nurden A.T. Rosa J.P. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1986; 107: 384-392PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fujimura K. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10247-10252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that αIIbऔ3 expressed on 293T transfectants is similarly susceptible to the EDTA-induced subunit dissociation. Incubation of cells expressing wild type αIIbऔ3 with 5 mm EDTA at pH 8.4 completely abolished binding of the αऔ complex-specific mAbs AP2 (34Pidard D. Montgomery R.R. Bennett J.S. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12582-12586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 10E5 (34Pidard D. Montgomery R.R. Bennett J.S. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12582-12586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but had no effect on binding of the औ3-specific mAb AP3 (Fig.4A). The complex-specific mAbs require the presence of a complex between αIIb- and औ3-subunits for recognition, and loss of reactivity is thus an excellent indicator of subunit dissociation. In contrast to the wild type receptor, binding of the mAbs AP2 and 10E5 to the mutant αIIb-E324C/औ3-G293C receptor was unaffected by EDTA treatment (Fig. 4B) showing that the disulfide bond conferred resistance to EDTA-induced subunit dissociation. Thus, maintenance of a covalent connection between the औ-propeller and I-like domains is sufficient to protect the epitopes of the AP2 and 10E5 mAbs, suggesting that the deleterious effect of EDTA on these epitopes is a consequence of subunit separation, rather than a direct stabilizing effect of divalent cations on residues within the epitopes. We used the AP2 and 10E5 mAbs to determine whether RGD-mimetic peptides, like EDTA, could induce head separation of cell surface αIIbऔ3. Incubation of wild type αIIbऔ3 293T cell transfectants with 100 ॖm GRGDSP peptide resulted in full exposure of cryptic epitopes called ligand-induced binding sites (data not shown), as described previously (35Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Shiraga M. Tadokoro S. Takamatsu J. Saito H. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggesting that all of the αIIbऔ3 on the cell surface bound GRGDSP peptide. However, preincubation with and the continued presence of 100 ॖm RGD peptide had no effect on binding of AP2 and 10E5 mAbs to αIIbऔ3 (Fig. 4A). This result not only establishes that RGD peptide and these mAbs bind to independent sites on the αIIbऔ3 headpiece but also strongly suggests that the two subunits stay associated in the headpiece when RGD peptide is bound. High affinity ligand-mimetic compounds can stabilize integrin αऔ complexes and make them resistant to SDS-induced dissociation during gel electrophoresis (37Thibault G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Thibault G. Tardif P. Lapalme G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 296: 690-696Google Scholar). A wide variety of integrins can be stabilized, including αIIbऔ3 (17Hantgan R.R. Rocco M. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1614-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Zolotarjova N.I. Hollis G.F. Wynn R. J. Biol.

In these studies, the integrins were either native or were recombinant integrins containing the entire extracellular domain. In the bent integrin conformation, there are substantial interactions between the α- and औ-subunits in both the headpiece and tailpiece (4Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). To clarify whether ligand-mimetic peptide binding stabilizes the αऔ interface present within the headpiece, we designed a truncated αIIbऔ3 integrin fragment composed only of headpiece segments. It contains the αIIbऔ-propeller and thigh domains and the औ3plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI), I-like, hybrid, and the first integrin-epidermal growth factor-1 domains; the only α−औ interface present in this fragment is between the औ-propeller and I-like domains (Fig. 1). When the purified αIIbऔ3 headpiece fragment was incubated with SDS sample buffer at room temperature and subjected to SDS-PAGE, two distinct bands corresponding to the truncated αIIb- and औ3-subunits were found (Fig.5, lane 1). By contrast, when the αIIbऔ3 headpiece fragment was incubated with 10 ॖm of the RGD-mimetic compound L738,167 prior to SDS-PAGE, a single band with higher molecular mass was found with no free αIIb or औ3 fragments (Fig. 5,lane 2). Thus, the αIIbऔ3headpiece becomes resistant to dissociation by SDS after incubation with a ligand-mimetic peptide. The ligand-mimetic compound strengthens association between the औ-propeller domain of αIIb and the I-like domain of औ3 probably by providing an additional interaction between them, as seen in the crystal structure in which an RGD-mimetic peptide binds to αV through its Arg and औ3 through its Asp (6Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Stabilization by the ligand-mimetic compound of αऔ headpiece association is in strong contradiction to the notion that ligand-mimetic peptides cause dissociation of the α- and औ-subunits in the headpiece. Our study definitively establishes that head separation is not required for activation of ligand binding by integrins, as shown with both αIIbऔ3 and αVऔ3 by introduction of a covalent linkage between the α-subunit औ-propeller domain and the औ-subunit I-like domain. Despite the covalent linkage, binding of αIIbऔ3 to fibrinogen, and αVऔ3 to fibrinogen and fibronectin, was fully activable. We used the AP2 and 10E5 mAbs, which bind to epitopes contained wholly within the αIIbऔ3headpiece and are specific for the αIIbऔ3complex, to monitor separation between αIIb and औ3 in the headpiece within intact αIIbऔ3 on the cell surface. EDTA dissociated the αIIbऔ3 headpiece as shown by loss of both epitopes. However, the ligand-mimetic GRGDSP peptide did not dissociate the headpiece, despite saturation binding to αIIbऔ3 as shown by full exposure of ligand-induced binding site epitopes. Finally, a high affinity RGD-mimetic compound was found to stabilize association between αIIb and औ3 in a fragment containing only the headpiece. These results completely contradict the idea that RGD-mimetics induce headpiece separation. A model for I domain-containing integrins, in which separation between the α-subunit औ-propeller and the औ-subunit I-like domain allows the α-subunit I domain to bind to the औ-propeller domain in place of the I-like domain (15Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), also seems highly unlikely in view of our results, because integrins that contain and lack I domains are activated by similar mechanisms (3Takagi J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). By contrast, the results are completely consistent with an alternative model of integrin activation, in which the integrin headpiece stays associated and ligand binding affinity is linked to the equilibrium between bent and extended integrin conformations, and between two headpiece conformations that differ in the angle between the I-like and hybrid domains (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In contrast to the headpiece separation model, the bent-extended model has received experimental support. Disulfide bonds that stabilize the bent conformation inhibit integrin activation (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), and an introduced N-glycosylation site designed to wedge open the angle between the I-like and hybrid domains activates ligand binding (36Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of αVऔ3 bound to an RGD ligand-mimetic peptide was obtained by soaking the peptide into a crystal containing the bent conformer of αVऔ3 (6Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Some movement was seen at the औ-propeller interface with the I-like domain upon ligand binding, but its magnitude was small and compatible with the disulfide bonds we have introduced. Thus, the distances between Cα atoms before and after ligand binding, respectively, are 6.7 and 6.8 Å for αV-M400/औ3-Q267, and 5.8 and 5.8 Å for αV-E311/औ3-G293. In the absence of restraining crystal lattice contacts, ligand-mimetic peptide binding induces adoption of the high affinity, extended conformation of αVऔ3 and a change in angle between the I-like and hybrid domains (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Our disulfide bond-linked mutants are fully competent for high affinity ligand binding. Therefore, any further change in orientation of the औ-propeller domain with respect to the I-like domain between the ligand-bound bent and extended conformations must be relatively small. Apart from complete head separation, the possibility has been raised of integrin activation by a marked tilt of the I-like domain so that it separates from the औ-propeller domain at the ligand binding interface but not on the opposite side of the interface, near where we have introduced disulfide bridges (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6868) Google Scholar, 15Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We note that the αIIb-E324C/औ3-G293C mutation involves residues that are buried in the औ-propeller I-like domain interface and that the surrounding region is highly conserved in αVand αIIb. Therefore, pivoting around the introduced disulfide bond to open the ligand-binding site seems unlikely, because on the side of the pivot opposite from the ligand-binding site residues are already closely packed. Thus, औ3 residue Glu-297 would clash with αV residue Phe-337, and औ3residues Leu-324 and Pro-326 would clash with αV residues Lys-308 and Leu-309; all of these αV residues are highly conserved in αIIb. Our results therefore rule out a significant tilting motion between the औ-propeller and I-like domains that would open up the ligand binding interface, as well as complete separation of these domains. This conclusion is in accord with high resolution EM projection averages that show no gross change in orientation between the औ-propeller and I-like domains upon ligand binding (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Indeed, the only inter-domain movement observed within the headpiece upon ligand binding is between the I-like and hybrid domains (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Partial head separation is also inconsistent with the crystal structure of RGD peptide bound to αVऔ3, because the Arg and Asp side chains of RGD are already extended in opposite directions (Fig. 1) (6Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), and separation at this interface would abolish one or the other of the highly specific interactions that these side chains make with the αV- and औ3-subunits, respectively. We have suggested that swinging of the hybrid domain pulls down the C-terminal helix of the I-like domain and as a consequence activates the metal ion-dependent adhesion site analogously to I domain activation (3Takagi J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 36Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since physiological ligands use many residues other than the potential metal ion-dependent adhesion site-coordinating residues to interact with integrins, it is natural to expect that conversion to the high affinity conformation involves rearrangement of residues of the α-औ interface outside of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site. In fact, there are activation-reporting mAbs that map to this region (41Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 42Zang Q. Lu C. Huang C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These rearrangements may involve loop remodeling and some reorientation between the औ-propeller and I-like domains, but in a more subtle degree than proposed by head separation/tilting models. Precise determination of the subtle conformational changes responsible for affinity regulation of integrins awaits further study using atomic resolution analysis. We thank Drs. Barry S. Coller, Makoto Handa, and George D. Hartman for the generous gifts."
