https://openalex.org/W2093793583,"The borders of human visual areas V1, V2, VP, V3, and V4 were precisely and noninvasively determined. Functional magnetic resonance images were recorded during phase-encoded retinal stimulation. This volume data set was then sampled with a cortical surface reconstruction, making it possible to calculate the local visual field sign (mirror image versus non-mirror image representation). This method automatically and objectively outlines area borders because adjacent areas often have the opposite field sign. Cortical magnification factor curves for striate and extrastriate cortical areas were determined, which showed that human visual areas have a greater emphasis on the center-of-gaze than their counterparts in monkeys. Retinotopically organized visual areas in humans extend anteriorly to overlap several areas previously shown to be activated by written words."
https://openalex.org/W2036528355,"Many diverse activities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are signaled through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). We have identified a novel 34 kDa protein, designated TRADD, that specifically interacts with an intracellular domain of TNFR1 known to be essential for mediating programmed cell death. Overexpression of TRADD leads to two major TNF-induced responses, apoptosis and activation of NF-kappa B. The C-terminal 118 amino acids of TRADD are sufficient to trigger both of these activities and likewise sufficient for interaction with the death domain of TNFR1. TRADD-mediated cell death can be suppressed by the crmA gene, which encodes a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. However, NF-kappa B activation by TRADD is not inhibited by crmA expression, demonstrating that the signaling pathways for TNF-induced cell death and NF-kappa B activation are distinct."

https://openalex.org/W1972676659,"Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are instrumental in determining cell type during development. A bHLH protein, termed NeuroD, for neurogenic differentiation, has now been identified as a differentiation factor for neurogenesis because (i) it is expressed transiently in a subset of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems at the time of their terminal differentiation into mature neurons and (ii) ectopic expression of neuroD in Xenopus embryos causes premature differentiation of neuronal precursors. Furthermore, neuroD can convert presumptive epidermal cells into neurons and also act as a neuronal determination gene. However, unlike another previously identified proneural gene (XASH-3), neuroD seems competent to bypass the normal inhibitory influences that usually prevent neurogenesis in ventral and lateral ectoderm and is capable of converting most of the embryonic ectoderm into neurons. The data suggest that neuroD may participate in the terminal differentiation step during vertebrate neuronal development."
https://openalex.org/W2000204824,"The yeast non-Mendelian factor [psi+] has been suggested to be a self-modified protein analogous to mammalian prions. Here it is reported that an intermediate amount of the chaperone protein Hsp104 was required for the propagation of the [psi+] factor. Over-production or inactivation of Hsp104 caused the loss of [psi+]. These results suggest that chaperone proteins play a role in prion-like phenomena, and that a certain level of chaperone expression can cure cells of prions without affecting viability. This may lead to antiprion treatments that involve the alteration of chaperone amounts or activity."
https://openalex.org/W2017767253,"A gene from human chromosome 11p11.2 was isolated and was shown to suppress metastasis when introduced into rat AT6.1 prostate cancer cells. Expression of this gene, designated KAI1, was reduced in human cell lines derived from metastatic prostate tumors. KAI1 specifies a protein of 267 amino acids, with four hydrophobic and presumably transmembrane domains and one large extracellular hydrophilic domain with three potential N-glycosylation sites. KAI1 is evolutionarily conserved, is expressed in many human tissues, and encodes a member of a structurally distinct family of leukocyte surface glycoproteins. Decreased expression of this gene may be involved in the malignant progression of prostate and other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2015304573,"The crystal structure of urease from Klebsiella aerogenes has been determined at 2.2 A resolution and refined to an R factor of 18.2 percent. The enzyme contains four structural domains: three with novel folds playing structural roles, and an (alpha beta)8 barrel domain, which contains the bi-nickel center. The two active site nickels are 3.5 A apart. One nickel ion is coordinated by three ligands (with low occupancy of a fourth ligand) and the second is coordinated by five ligands. A carbamylated lysine provides an oxygen ligand to each nickel, explaining why carbon dioxide is required for the activation of urease apoenzyme. The structure is compatible with a catalytic mechanism whereby urea ligates Ni-1 to complete its tetrahedral coordination and a hydroxide ligand of Ni-2 attacks the carbonyl carbon. A surprisingly high structural similarity between the urease catalytic domain and that of the zinc-dependent adenosine deaminase reveals a remarkable example of active site divergence."
https://openalex.org/W2041622179,"In several pedigrees of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), point mutations in the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene are genetically linked to the disease. This finding implicates APP in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease in these individuals. To understand the in vivo function of APP and its processing, we have generated an APP-null mutation in mice. Homozygous APP-deficient mice were viable and fertile. However, the mutant animals weighed 15%-20% less than age-matched wild-type controls. Neurological evaluation showed that the APP-deficient mice exhibited a decreased locomotor activity and forelimb grip strength, indicating a compromised neuronal or muscular function. In addition, four out of six homozygous mice showed reactive gliosis at 14 weeks of age, suggesting an impaired neuronal function as a result of the APP-null mutation."

https://openalex.org/W1998607972,"Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) was originally isolated from erythroid cell RNA by differential screening and shown to be erythroid-specific, although a low level of EKLF was found in mast cell lines. EKLF contains three zinc-fingers homologous to those found in the Krüppel family of transcription factors. Because it binds the sequence CCACACCCT, EKLF may affect erythroid development as a result of its ability to bind to the CAC box in the promoter of the beta-globin gene. Mutation of this element leads to reduced beta-globin expression and it appears to mediate the effect of the globin locus control region on the promoter. Here we inactivate the EKLF gene through insertion of a lacZ reporter gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Heterozygous EKLF+/- mice show that the reporter gene is expressed in a developmentally specific manner in all types of erythroblasts in the fetal liver and adult bone marrow. Homozygous EKLF-/- mice appear normal during the embryonic stage of haematopoiesis in the yolk sac, but develop a fatal anaemia during early fetal life when haematopoiesis has switched to the fetal liver. Enucleated erythrocytes are formed but these do not contain the proper amount of haemoglobin. We conclude that the transcription factor EKLF is essential for the final steps of definitive erythropoiesis in fetal liver."
https://openalex.org/W2021647551,"The control of calcium release from intracellular stores (the sarcoplasmic reticulum) in cardiac muscle was examined with the use of a confocal microscope and voltage clamp techniques. Depolarization evoked graded calcium release by altering the extent of spatial and temporal summation of elementary calcium release events called ""calcium sparks."" These evoked sparks were triggered by local L-type calcium channel currents in a stochastic manner, were similar at different potentials, and resembled spontaneous calcium sparks. Once triggered, the calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during a calcium spark was independent of the duration of the triggering calcium influx. These results were used to develop a unifying model for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling that explains the large (but paradoxically stable) amplification of the trigger calcium influx by a combination of digital and analog behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2069230499,"Excitation-contraction coupling was studied in mammalian cardiac cells in which the opening probability of L-type calcium (Ca2+) channels was reduced. Confocal microscopy during voltage-clamp depolarization revealed distinct local transients in the concentration of intracellular calcium ions ([Ca2+]i). When voltage was varied, the latency to occurrence and the relative probability of occurrence of local [Ca2+]i transients varied as predicted if Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was linked tightly to Ca2+ flux through L-type Ca2+ channels but not to that through the Na-Ca exchanger or to average [Ca2+]i. Voltage had no effect on the amplitude of local [Ca2+]i transients. Thus, the most efficacious ""Ca2+ signal"" for activating Ca2+ release from the SR may be a transient microdomain of high [Ca2+]i beneath an individual, open L-type Ca2+ channel."

https://openalex.org/W2056422818,"The function of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-preferring glutamate receptor can be regulated by extracellular pH, a process that may be important during ischemia in the brain or during seizures. Protons inhibit NMDA receptor function by 50 percent at pH 7.3 through interactions with the NR1 subunit, and both polyamines and NR1 exon 5 potentiate receptor function through relief of the tonic proton inhibition present at physiological pH. A single amino acid (lysine 211) was identified that mediates the effects of exon 5 in the rat brain. Electroneutral substitutions at this position restored pH sensitivity and, consequently, polyamine relief of tonic inhibition. This effect, together with the structural similarities between polyamines and the surface loop encoded by exon 5, suggest that exon 5 may act as a tethered pH-sensitive constitutive modulator of NMDA receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2069009310,"Carrier-mediated prostaglandin transport has been postulated to occur in many tissues. On the basis of sequence homology, the protein of unknown function encoded by the rat matrin F/G complementary DNA was predicted to be an organic anion transporter. Expression of the matrin F/G complementary DNA in HeLa cells or Xenopus oocytes conferred the property of specific transport of prostaglandins. The tissue distribution of matrin F/G messenger RNA and the sensitivity of matrin F/G-induced prostaglandin transport to inhibitors were similar to those of endogenous prostaglandin transport. The protein encoded by the matrin F/G complementary DNA is thus preferably called PGT because it is likely to function as a prostaglandin transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1968925833,"The three-dimensional structure of the complex formed by two plasma proteins, transthyretin and retinol-binding protein, was determined from x-ray diffraction data to a nominal resolution of 3.1 angstroms. One tetramer of transthyretin was bound to two molecules of retinol-binding protein. The two retinol-binding protein molecules established molecular interactions with the same transthyretin dimer, and each also made contacts with one of the other two monomers. Thus, the other two potential binding sites in a transthyretin tetramer were blocked. The amino acid residues of the retinol-binding protein that were involved in the contacts were close to the retinol-binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1973731625,"Import of proteins into the nucleus is a two-step process, involving nuclear localization sequence (NLS)-dependent docking of the substrate at the nuclear envelope followed by translocation through the nuclear pore. A recombinant human protein, hSRP1 alpha, bound in vitro specifically and directly to substrates containing either a simple or bipartite NLS motif. hSRP1 alpha promoted docking of import substrates to the nuclear envelope and together with recombinant human Ran reconstituted complete nuclear protein import. Thus, hSRP1 alpha has the properties of a cytosolic receptor for both simple and bipartite NLS motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2085732532,"Structural characterization of biomolecules in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is based primarily on the use of interproton distances derived from homonuclear cross-relaxation experiments. Information about short time-scale dynamics, on the other hand, is obtained from relaxation rates of heteronuclear spin pairs such as 15N-1H. By combining the two types of data and utilizing the dependence of heteronuclear NMR relaxation rates on anisotropic diffusional rotational tumbling, it is possible to obtain structural information about long-range motional correlations between protein domains. This approach was applied to characterize the relative orientations and mobilities of the first three zinc-finger domains of the Xenopus transcription factor TFIIIA in aqueous solution. The data indicate that the motions of the individual zinc-finger domains are highly correlated on time scales shorter than 10 nanoseconds and that the average conformation of the three-finger polypeptide is elongated."
https://openalex.org/W2027541804,"The kinetics, gain, and reliability of light responses of rod and cone photoreceptors are important determinants of overall visual sensitivity. In voltage recordings from photoreceptors in an intact primate retina, rods were found to be functionally isolated from each other, unlike the tightly coupled rods of cold-blooded vertebrates. Cones were observed to receive excitatory input from rods, which indicates that the cone pathway also processes rod signals. This input might be expected to degrade the spatial resolution of mesopic vision."

https://openalex.org/W2051616273,"Mutations in genes required for associative learning and memory in Drosophila exist, but isolation of the genes has been difficult because most are defined by a single, chemically induced allele. Here, a simplified genetic screen was used to identify candidate genes involved in learning and memory. Second site suppressors of the dunce (dnc) female sterility phenotype were isolated with the use of transposon mutagenesis. One suppressor mutation that was recovered mapped in the amnesiac (amn) gene. Cloning of the locus revealed that amn encodes a previously uncharacterized neuropeptide gene. Thus, with the cloning of amn, specific neuropeptides are implicated in the memory process."
https://openalex.org/W2046177801,"Gene trap transposon mutagenesis can identify essential genes whose functions in later development are obscured by an early lethal phenotype. In higher plants, many genes are required for haploid gametophyte viability, so that the phenotypic effects of their disruption cannot be readily observed in the diploid plant body. The PROLIFERA (PRL) gene, identified by gene trap transposon mutagenesis in Arabidopsis, is required for megagametophyte and embryo development. Reporter gene expression patterns revealed that PRL was expressed in dividing cells throughout the plant. PRL is related to the MCM2-3-5 family of yeast genes that are required for the initiation of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1997586616,"The high-speed solar wind streaming from the southern coronal hole was remarkably uniform and steady and was confined by a sharp boundary that extended to the corona and chromosphere. Charge state measurements indicate that the electron temperature in this coronal hole reached a maximum of about 1.5 million kelvin within 3 solar radii of the sun. This result, combined with the observed lack of depletion of heavy elements, suggests that an additional source of momentum is required to accelerate the polar wind."

https://openalex.org/W2026395113,"Ulysses has explored the field and particle environment of the sun's polar region. The solar wind speed was fast and nearly constant above -50 degrees latitude. Compositional differences were observed in slow (low-latitude) solar wind and in fast (high-latitude) solar wind. The radial magnetic field did not change with latitude, implying that polar cap magnetic fields are transported toward the equator. The intensity of galactic cosmic rays was nearly independent of latitude. Their access to the polar region is opposed by outward-traveling, large amplitude waves in the magnetic field."

https://openalex.org/W1992214391,"Measurements with the Energetic Particle Composition instrument (EPAC) aboard Ulysses show particles from near the ecliptic that were apparently accelerated by shocks associated with a corotating interaction region. The particles were detected together with the shocks and even when shocks no longer arrived at Ulysses up to -65 degrees of heliographic latitude but not beyond. Particles could have reached these latitudes along magnetic fields; such connections to the outer lower latitude heliosphere evidently do not exist above that latitude. The accelerated streams have composition similar to solar wind abundances, no dispersion, and a net inward anisotropy. The underlying composition between the recurrent stream is similar to the anomalous component of cosmic rays. The channel sensitive to high-energy protons (> 230 megaelectron volts) shows a 26-day variation of the flux superimposed on the heliospheric modulation of galactic ions."
https://openalex.org/W2044760640,"The heliosphere instrument for spectrum, composition, and anisotropy (HISCALE) recorded the fluxes of low-energy ions and electrons (> 50 kiloelectron volts) when Ulysses crossed the southern solar polar region and revealed that the large-scale structure of the heliosphere to at least approximately -75 degrees was significantly influenced by the near-equatorial heliospheric current sheet. Electrons in particular were accelerated by the current sheet-produced and poleward-propagating interplanetary reverse shock at helioradii far from the Ulysses location. At heliolatitudes higher than approximately -75 degrees on the Ulysses ascent to the pole and approximately -50 degrees on the descent, small, less regular enhancements of the lowest energy electron fluxes were measured whose relations to the current sheet were less clear. The anomalous component of low-energy (approximately 2 to 5 megaelectron volts per nucleon) oxygen flux at the highest heliolatitudes was found to be approximately 10(-8) [per square centimeter per second per steradian (per kiloelectronvolt per nucleon)]; the anomalous Ne/O ratio was approximately 0.25."

Heat shock proteins are believed, and in a few instances have been shown, to be the agents conferring this resistance. The role of a small cytoplasmic RNA (G8 RNA) in developing thermotolerance in Tetrahymena thermophila was investigated by creating a strain devoid of all functional G8 genes. These G8 null cells mounted an apparently normal heat shock response, but they were unable to establish thermotolerance."
