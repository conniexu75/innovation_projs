https://openalex.org/W2058552581,"THE heterogeneous population of rat liver1 has led to a discussion of the interpretation of enzyme activities based on whole liver or whole liver proteins2. Recent interest in the properties of suspensions of parenchymatous liver cells3,4 has raised the possibility of using such cells as reference base for enzyme determinations. By shaking rat liver slices in calcium-free citrated Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer with added glucose, passing the slices through graded sieves to break them into the component cells, centrifuging and resuspending the sediment, we have shown5,6 that the cells of such suspensions leak most of their content of glutamic pyruvic transaminase while retaining glutamic oxalacetic transaminase. Subsequent studies have shown that in general between 70 and 90 per cent of lactic acid dehydrogenase, ‘TPN-linked’ isocitric dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase are similarly lost from the cells in the course of making the preparation. The leakage of lactic acid dehydrogenase was not prevented by making the medium between 0.01 M and 1 M in pyruvate both with and without the addition of 2–5 per cent bovine albumen fraction V, by the presence of adenosine triphosphate (750 mgm. per cent) crystalline human oxyhaemoglobin (5–10 per cent) and carbonic anhydrase, the latter two being used both singly and in combination. By making the medium 20 per cent in washed human red blood cells the leakage appeared to be inhibited7."

https://openalex.org/W2040882659,"ALTHOUGH œstriol, œstrone and œstradiol have been detected in mixed avian excreta1 and in extracts of ovaries of laying hens2 by chromatographic methods, it would appear that only œstradiol-17β has been isolated hitherto from avian material in crystalline form and identified by infra-red spectrophotometry3. We have now secured similar evidence for the presence of œstrone in avian urine."

https://openalex.org/W2080398663,"IN previous work1 it was shown that colchicine, when injected intraperitoneally, inhibits activities of rat liver xanthine oxidase and dehydrogenase. A strong inhibition was also observed when this drug was added in vitro to purified liver xanthine oxidase but statistically significant changes were not noted when colchicine was added to liver homogenate. The present work deals with the effect of this drug on the rat blood serum xanthine oxidase."

This subtraction technique has formed the basis of analytical procedures for the determination of the normal paraffins in complex petroleum fractions and has been applied in conjunction with both packed and capillary columns3."

If the skin is irradiated in vivo with an erythemal dose of x-rays 24 hours prior to perfusion, the uptake of radioactive glucose into glycogen is significantly increased. The irradiation effect appears to be due to enzymatic dysbalance."
