Here, we demonstrate that upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, macrophages shift from producing ATP by oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis while also increasing succinate levels. We show that increased mitochondrial oxidation of succinate via succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and an elevation of mitochondrial membrane potential combine to drive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. RNA sequencing reveals that this combination induces a pro-inflammatory gene expression profile, while an inhibitor of succinate oxidation, dimethyl malonate (DMM), promotes an anti-inflammatory outcome. Blocking ROS production with rotenone by uncoupling mitochondria or by expressing the alternative oxidase (AOX) inhibits this inflammatory phenotype, with AOX protecting mice from LPS lethality. The metabolic alterations that occur upon activation of macrophages therefore repurpose mitochondria from ATP synthesis to ROS production in order to promote a pro-inflammatory state.

The metabolic alterations that occur upon activation of macrophages therefore repurpose mitochondria from ATP synthesis to ROS production in order to promote a pro-inflammatory state. Macrophages have two key roles: to respond rapidly to infection and injury and then to help repair the tissue damage that occurs as a result of this response. This requires macrophages to initially adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype and then later, when the immediate danger has passed, to acquire an anti-inflammatory phenotype to promote resolution and repair. The factors that drive and sustain these changes are not fully understood. However, multiple lines of evidence implicate alterations in mitochondrial function, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and related metabolic pathways in this phenotypic switch (O’Neill and Pearce, 2016O’Neill L.A. Pearce E.J. Immunometabolism governs dendritic cell and macrophage function.J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). For example, pro-inflammatory macrophages are more glycolytic, produce more ROS, and accumulate succinate to a greater extent than resting macrophages (O’Neill and Pearce, 2016O’Neill L.A. Pearce E.J. Immunometabolism governs dendritic cell and macrophage function.J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Even so, the mechanisms and significance of these changes are obscure. The electron transport chain (ETC) is a major component of mitochondrial metabolism, and resting macrophages utilize this efficient form of oxidative metabolism to generate ATP. However, once macrophages are activated (e.g., with the Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4] agonist lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), oxidative phosphorylation is suppressed, and cells favor glycolysis as an alternative, but less energetically efficient, mode of ATP generation (Tannahill et al., 2013Tannahill G.M.

Foley N.H. et al.Succinate is an inflammatory signal that induces IL-1β through HIF-1α.Nature. 2013; 496: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). In dendritic cells (DCs), the switch to glycolysis and away from oxidative phosphorylation supports fatty acid synthesis required for the expansion of organelles necessary for the production and secretion of key proteins essential for DC activation (Everts et al., 2014Everts B. Amiel E. Huang S.C. Smith A.M. Chang C.H. Lam W.Y. Redmann V. Freitas T.C. Blagih J. van der Windt G.J. et al.TLR-driven early glycolytic reprogramming via the kinases TBK1-IKKε supports the anabolic demands of dendritic cell activation.Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) and to prevent apoptosis in the face of a lowered level of ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation (Everts et al., 2012Everts B. Amiel E. van der Windt G.J. Freitas T.C. Chott R. Yarasheski K.E. Pearce E.L. Pearce E.J. Commitment to glycolysis sustains survival of NO-producing inflammatory dendritic cells.Blood. 2012; 120: 1422-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). TLR4 stimulation will also lead to mitochondrial ROS generation from complex I through an unknown mechanism (West et al., 2011West A.P. Brodsky I.E. Rahner C. Woo D.K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Walsh M.C. Choi Y. Shadel G.S. Ghosh S. TLR signalling augments macrophage bactericidal activity through mitochondrial ROS.Nature. 2011; 472: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activated T cells maintain oxidative phosphorylation in conjunction with glycolysis, but whether oxidative metabolism is required for the production of biosynthetic precursors and ATP following stimulation or to generate a ROS signal is unclear (Sena et al., 2013Sena L.A. Li S. Jairaman A. Prakriya M. Ezponda T. Hildeman D.A. Wang C.R. Schumacker P.T. Licht J.D.

Here, we set out to determine the mechanistic rationale underlying the mitochondrial, ROS, and metabolic changes in macrophages that determine the inflammatory status of the cell, noting that all are linked by electron transfer in the ETC. We have found that following stimulation with LPS, macrophages repurpose their mitochondria from ATP production to succinate-dependent ROS generation, with glycolysis taking on the role of ATP generation, enabling mitochondria to sustain a high membrane potential. Thus, the enhanced production of succinate is a critical regulator of the pro-inflammatory response to LPS, both through the generation of ROS following oxidation by the ETC and via HIF-1α stabilization. Concurrently, anti-inflammatory gene expression is decreased following succinate oxidation. These events demonstrate a role for succinate oxidation by the ETC in the pro-inflammatory response to LPS and provide insights into the previously elusive mechanism by which macrophages generate mitochondrial ROS. We have identified a process whereby mitochondrial metabolism is intimately linked to the profound gene expression changes that occur in macrophages in order for them to fulfill their dual role in inflammation and its resolution. Succinate is a well established pro-inflammatory metabolite that is known to accumulate during macrophage activation, the levels of which affect HIF-1α activity, a key transcription factor in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Tannahill et al., 2013Tannahill G.M. Curtis A.M. Adamik J. Palsson-McDermott E.M. McGettrick A.F. Goel G. Frezza C. Bernard N.J. Kelly B. Foley N.H. et al.Succinate is an inflammatory signal that induces IL-1β through HIF-1α.Nature. 2013; 496: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of pretreatment of LPS-activated bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with cell-permeable diethyl succinate (hereafter referred to as succinate), which greatly increases succinate in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix. Succinate enhanced LPS-induced interleukin-1β (IL-1β) mRNA and pro-IL-1β protein with an accompanying boost in HIF-1α protein levels (Figures 1A–1C), as previously shown (Tannahill et al., 2013Tannahill G.M. Curtis A.M. Adamik J. Palsson-McDermott E.M. McGettrick A.F. Goel G. Frezza C. Bernard N.J. Kelly B. Foley N.H. et al.Succinate is an inflammatory signal that induces IL-1β through HIF-1α.Nature. 2013; 496: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). Succinate also boosted LPS-induced glycolysis (Figure S2A). Importantly, this synergistic effect of exogenous succinate and LPS did not occur for another pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (Figures 1D and 1E), demonstrating the specificity of this response. Succinate alone had no effect on cytokine production, nor did it affect LPS-induced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation either on its own (Figure 1F, left) or in combination with LPS (Figure 1F, right), as measured by p65 phosphorylation (Figure 1F, top) or IκB degradation (Figure 1F, third panel). Conversely, succinate inhibited the induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1RA (Figure 1G) and IL-10 (Figure 1H) in response to LPS. The effect of succinate on IL-10 was rapid, being evident from 1 hr, and sustained for both mRNA (Figure 1H) and protein (Figure 1I) induction, and it was concentration dependent (Figure 1J). While two other Krebs cycle metabolites, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and fumarate, increased the LPS-induced IL-1β message, their effects on LPS-induced pro-IL-1β were far less robust than for succinate (Figures S1A and S1B), and only succinate decreased LPS-induced IL-10 production (Figure S1C, left). Furthermore, fumarate also boosted LPS-induced TNF-α, suggesting its pro-inflammatory effects are mechanistically distinct from succinate (Figure S1C, right). Moreover, diethyl butyl malonate (DEBM), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial succinate transporter, which causes endogenous succinate to accumulate, boosted LPS-induced IL-1β and limited IL-10, with no effect on TNF-α (Figures S1D–S1F). These findings suggest that succinate acts within the cell to enhance and sustain endogenous pro-inflammatory gene expression while at the same time inhibiting anti-inflammatory gene expression.Figure S2The Effects of Succinate May Be HIF-1α Dependent, but They Are Independent of cMyc and IL-10, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A–K) BMDMs were pretreated with succinate (Suc; 5 mM) then stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 48 hr (A-C) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and proton production rate (PPR) were analyzed as read-outs for oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, respectively, using the Seahorse XF-24.

To examine how succinate within macrophages might have opposing effects on pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, we investigated two of the ways in which succinate could act within the cell, either by enhancing HIF-1α activation by inhibiting prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) function or as a result of oxidation by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). Succinate was found to robustly boost LPS-induced HIF-1α protein levels, an effect that was not observed by any other metabolite tested (Figure S2D). Moreover, the HIF-1α activator dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) mimicked the effect of succinate on IL-1β (Figures S2F, right, and S2G). Succinate did not alter the expression of cMyc, another transcription factor with a known role in the regulation of macrophage function (Pello et al., 2012Pello O.M. De Pizzol M. Mirolo M. Soucek L. Zammataro L. Amabile A. Doni A. Nebuloni M. Swigart L.B. Evan G.I. et al.Role of c-MYC in alternative activation of human macrophages and tumor-associated macrophage biology.Blood. 2012; 119: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), nor did it alter the expression of its downstream target, CD71 (Figures S2H–S2J). We therefore conclude that succinate’s pro-inflammatory effects require HIF-1α stabilization. We also tested the cell-permeable molecule dimethyl malonate (DMM), which is rapidly hydrolyzed within the cell to generate malonate, a potent competitive inhibitor of succinate oxidation by SDH (Dervartanian and Veeger, 1964Dervartanian D.V. Veeger C. Studies on succinate dehydrogenase. I. Spectral properties of the purified enzyme and formation of enzyme-competitive inhibitor complexes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 92: 233-247PubMed Google Scholar). DMM led to an increase in succinate in the cytosol, presumably by impairing the oxidation of succinate to fumarate, and also boosted LPS-induced succinate accumulation (Figure 2A). Importantly, succinate and malonate were the only two metabolites significantly altered by the addition of DMM in the presence or absence of LPS, demonstrating specificity (Figures S3A–S3J). DMM should inhibit effects of succinate that act through SDH in the mitochondria but enhance succinate action through PHD in the cytosol (as a result of the succinate boost evident by this agent). Intriguingly, in direct opposition to succinate, DMM abrogated LPS-induced IL-1β mRNA (Figure 2B), pro-IL-1β protein, and HIF-1α (Figure 2C, compare lane 5 to lane 7) while leaving TNF-α unaffected (Figures 2D and 2E). The primers used for the PCR are described in Table S7. At earlier time points, it appeared that DMM limited LPS-induced cMyc (Figure S2H); however, this was not significant, and at later time points, when DMM alters IL-1β, DMM had no effect on cMyc (Figures S2I and S2J). Again, in opposition to succinate, DMM boosted LPS-induced IL-1RA (Figure 2F) and IL-10 expression and production (Figures 2G and 2H). These data indicate that, in addition to direct effects on PHDs in the cytosol, the oxidation of succinate by mitochondria is central to the pro-inflammatory response of LPS-activated macrophages.Figure S3Succinate and Dimethyl Malonate Alter Levels of Succinate and Malonate, but Not Those of other Krebs Cycle Metabolites, and Also Impact the Transcriptome in LPS-Activated Macrophages, Related to Figures 1, 2, and 3Show full caption(A–M) BMDMs were pretreated for 3 hr with dimethyl malonate (DMM; 10 mM) or succinate (Suc; 5 mM) prior to stimulation with LPS (100ng/ml) for 24 hr (A – J).

The strength of the color refers to how strongly upregulated (red) or downregulated (blue) the various genes are. As IL-10 and IL-1β were reciprocally regulated by DMM, we examined whether IL-10 itself may be responsible for the regulation of IL-1β by this compound. This was not the case, as DMM still inhibited LPS-induced pro-IL-1β in the presence of an IL-10 receptor blocking antibody (Figure S2K). To further examine a role for SDH activity in the pro-inflammatory effects of succinate, we next employed macrophages from mice lacking the B subunit of SDH. The B subunit is required for succinate to reduce ubiquinone (Guzy et al., 2008Guzy R.D. Sharma B. Bell E. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Loss of the SdhB, but Not the SdhA, subunit of complex II triggers reactive oxygen species-dependent hypoxia-inducible factor activation and tumorigenesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 718-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and its absence will therefore block succinate oxidation. LPS-induced pro-IL-1β and HIF-1α were decreased in SDHB-deficient BMDMs (Figure 2I, top and middle, respectively; compare lane 2 to lane 4), while TNF-α was unchanged (Figure 2J). To gain further insight into how the manipulation of mitochondrial succinate oxidation might alter the phenotype of macrophages, we next determined the effects of succinate and DMM on the macrophage genome by performing RNA-sequencing analysis. This revealed whole sets of LPS-induced genes that were altered by DMM or succinate pretreatment (Figures 3 and S3K–S3M; Tables S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6). The gene expression values in different samples were modeled with a generalized linear model (detailed in STAR Methods). Of particular relevance is that many genes that were downregulated by DMM were reciprocally upregulated by succinate and vice versa (Figure S3M), further suggesting that the metabolism of succinate by SDH is crucial for its pro-inflammatory action. These gene sets were related to immune response pathways, including interferon (IFN) signaling, the cellular response to hypoxia, fatty acid metabolism, glycolytic processes, and positive and negative regulation of homeostasis (illustrated in Figure 3B). A direct comparison of LPS stimulation under pretreatment with DMM or succinate confirmed this, as several biological pathways related to homeostasis, metabolism, and inflammation were affected (Figure 3C), even under this stricter comparison. Most importantly, DMM suppressed expression of genes associated with inflammation (including those encoding IL-1β, HIF-1α-dependent genes, and genes involved in fatty acid synthesis) while boosting anti-inflammatory gene expression (such as the gene encoding IL-1RA and several type I IFN-inducible genes) (Figure 3B, blue histobars). Succinate had the opposite effect, boosting pro-inflammatory gene expression while decreasing anti-inflammatory gene expression (Figure 3B, red histobars). The reciprocal regulation of IL-1β and IL-1RA (both indicated with an arrow) is especially noteworthy. Type I IFNs are also of interest, as they inhibit LPS-induced pro-IL-1β production and boost IL-10 in BMDMs (Guarda et al., 2011Guarda G. Braun M. Staehli F. Tardivel A. Mattmann C. Förster I. Farlik M. Decker T. Du Pasquier R.A. Romero P. Tschopp J. Type I interferon inhibits interleukin-1 production and inflammasome activation.Immunity. 2011; 34: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), providing further mechanistic evidence for the regulation of IL-10, and indeed of IL-1β, by these agents. As expected, RNA sequencing revealed that succinate induced, while DMM limited, HIF-1α activity. These findings suggest that HIF-1α is an important part of the mechanism by which succinate and DMM regulate IL-1β and confirm that the extent of succinate oxidation by mitochondrial SDH controls LPS-induced gene expression. When active, SDH boosts inflammatory gene expression, and when inhibited, an anti-inflammatory phenotype ensues. Taken together, these results indicate that SDH is a critical regulator of the macrophage phenotype. Inhibiting SDH causes succinate to accumulate but importantly prevents the induction of a range of pro-inflammatory factors, typified by IL-1β, while enhancing a range of anti-inflammatory factors, typified by IL-1RA and IL-10. Increased oxidation of succinate by SDH in mitochondria is therefore required for the induction of pro-inflammatory genes while simultaneously limiting the induction of anti-inflammatory ones. To examine if SDH activity was also involved in the pro-inflammatory response in vivo, we next investigated the effect of DMM on LPS action in mice. DMM was effective in an LPS-induced sepsis model, where it decreased serum levels of IL-1β (Figure 4A) and boosted IL-10 (Figure 4B), but had no significant effect on TNF-α (Figure 4C). DMM reduced IL-1β (Figures 4D and 4E) and PHD3 expression (Figure 4F) in the spleen. SDH activity is therefore critical for determining the inflammatory phenotype, both in vitro and in vivo. To further explore the mechanism by which SDH might affect the macrophage phenotype, we next considered how SDH activity interacts with other metabolic changes occurring in LPS-activated macrophages. A hallmark of the pro-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages is their switch away from ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation to glycolytic metabolism (O’Neill and Pearce, 2016O’Neill L.A.

Foley N.H. et al.Succinate is an inflammatory signal that induces IL-1β through HIF-1α.Nature. 2013; 496: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). Previous work showed that inhibiting glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) prevented activation of HIF-1α and induction of IL-1β in LPS-treated macrophages yet had no effect on TNF-α production (Tannahill et al., 2013Tannahill G.M.

These data suggested that the enhanced glycolytic ATP production upon activation may act in combination with the stimulation of SDH to sustain the pro-inflammatory phenotype. We hypothesized that the increased ATP generated by glycolysis in the cytosol would significantly decrease the requirement for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to supply ATP to the cell. Such a shift would decrease resting oxygen consumption by the mitochondrial respiratory chain, as has been shown previously (Tannahill et al., 2013Tannahill G.M. Curtis A.M. Adamik J. Palsson-McDermott E.M. McGettrick A.F. Goel G. Frezza C. Bernard N.J. Kelly B. Foley N.H. et al.Succinate is an inflammatory signal that induces IL-1β through HIF-1α.Nature. 2013; 496: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that glycolysis is boosted by LPS (Figure 5A) and oxygen consumption is decreased (Figure 5B), yet not abrogated, by LPS (Figure 5E). LPS decreased the ATP/ADP ratio consistent with a shift from ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation to ATP synthesis by glycolysis (Figure 5D). Importantly, addition of oligomycin, which will abolish any contribution to ATP synthesis by the ETC, to control cells dramatically decreased respiration yet had no effect on the ATP/ADP ratio in LPS-treated cells (Figure 5D). Taken together, these data indicate that following LPS treatment, cells were not making ATP by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It is interesting to note that inhibition of the ATP synthase with oligomycin decreased LPS-induced IL-1β, suggesting that some level of ATP synthesis within the mitochondrial matrix may be necessary for the generation of a pro-inflammatory response (Figure S5). The NAD+/NADH ratio also decreased with LPS treatment (Figure 5C), consistent with a decrease in mitochondrial NADH oxidation and complex I forward activity.Figure 5Glycolytic ATP Production Facilitates an Increase in Mitochondrial Membrane Potential that Is Required for the Pro-inflammatory Effects of LPSShow full caption(A–E) BMDMs were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 48 hr (A and B) or 24 hr (C and D).

Here, we demonstrate that patients identified as non-responders to anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) have tumors with genomic defects in IFN-γ pathway genes. Furthermore, mice bearing melanoma tumors with knockdown of IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) have impaired tumor rejection upon anti-CTLA-4 therapy. These data highlight that loss of the IFN-γ signaling pathway is associated with primary resistance to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Our findings demonstrate the importance of tumor genomic data, especially IFN-γ related genes, as prognostic information for patients selected to receive treatment with immune checkpoint therapy."

Using this resource, they found that ∼20% of schizophrenia loci have variants that may contribute to altered gene expression and liability. Over 100 genetic loci harbor schizophrenia-associated variants, yet how these variants confer liability is uncertain. The CommonMind Consortium sequenced RNA from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of people with schizophrenia (N = 258) and control subjects (N = 279), creating a resource of gene expression and its genetic regulation. Using this resource, ∼20% of schizophrenia loci have variants that could contribute to altered gene expression and liability. In five loci, only a single gene was involved: FURIN, TSNARE1, CNTN4, CLCN3 or SNAP91. Altering expression of FURIN, TSNARE1 or CNTN4 changed neurodevelopment in zebrafish; knockdown of FURIN in human neural progenitor cells yielded abnormal migration. Of 693 genes showing significant case-versus-control differential expression, their fold changes were ≤ 1.33, and an independent cohort yielded similar results. Gene co-expression implicates a network relevant for schizophrenia. Our findings show that schizophrenia is polygenic and highlight the utility of this resource for mechanistic interpretations of genetic liability for brain diseases."

Despite the high global burden of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection (Zumla et al., 2013Zumla A. Raviglione M. Hafner R. von Reyn C.F. Tuberculosis.N. Engl. J.

Along these lines, Abs against the Mtb lipoarabinomannan enhance bacterial opsonization and restrict intracellular growth (Chen et al., 2016Chen T. Blanc C. Eder A.Z. Prados-Rosales R. Souza A.C.O.

Commun. 2016; 7: 11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), highlighting the mounting evidence for a possible role for Abs in Mtb protective immunity. Beyond opsonization, Abs direct innate immune antimicrobial activity via their constant (Fc) domains following engagement of FcRs found on all innate immune cells (Casadevall and Pirofski, 2006Casadevall A.

These functions, interrogated extensively in the monoclonal therapeutics field (Bakema and van Egmond, 2014Bakema J.E. van Egmond M.

Fc-receptors and immunity to malaria: from models to vaccines.Parasite Immunol. 2009; 31: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These Fc effector functions are regulated immunologically via two features of the Ab Fc domain: (1) through Fc class-switch recombination selecting different isotypes (i.e., immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE) and/or subclasses (e.g., IgG1, 2, 3, 4) and (2) the post-translational addition of distinct glycan species on the Fc domain of antibodies, specifically at asparagine 297 on IgG (Vidarsson et al., 2014Vidarsson G. Dekkers G. Rispens T. IgG subclasses and allotypes: from structure to effector functions.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). In particular, Ab glycosylation varies with age, sex, disease state, treatment, infection, and vaccination, which likely reflect the highly sensitive and dynamic processes that actively alter Ab effector function during an inflammatory response (Ackerman et al., 2013Ackerman M.E.

Mice deficient in activating FcRs exhibit enhanced immunopathology and elevated bacterial burden, while those lacking the inhibitory FcR have diminished pathology (Maglione et al., 2008Maglione P.J. Xu J. Casadevall A. Chan J. Fc gamma receptors regulate immune activation and susceptibility during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similarly, higher expression of the activating high-affinity FcγRI (Sutherland et al., 2014Sutherland J.S. Loxton A.G. Haks M.C. Kassa D. Ambrose L. Lee J.S. Ran L. van Baarle D. Maertzdorf J.

Infect. 2014; 20: O230-O238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and loss of the activating low-affinity FcγRIIIb are associated with enhanced TB disease (Machado et al., 2013Machado L.R. Bowdrey J. Ngaimisi E. Habtewold A. Minzi O. Makonnen E. Yimer G. Amogne W. Mugusi S. Janabi M. et al.Copy number variation of Fc gamma receptor genes in HIV-infected and HIV-tuberculosis co-infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e78165Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, collectively, these lines of evidence point to a potential role for Fc-mediated Ab modulation of TB disease. Hence, here we aimed to define whether distinct Ab Fc-effector functional profiles could contribute to Mtb control among individuals with latent TB (Ltb) who, though infected, successfully control Mtb such that they manifest no clinical symptoms, as compared to those with active TB disease (Atb), who lack such control. Using a systems serology approach (Chung et al., 2015Chung A.W. Kumar M.P. Arnold K.B. Yu W.H. Schoen M.K. Dunphy L.J. Suscovich T.J. Frahm N. Linde C. Mahan A.E. et al.Dissecting polyclonal vaccine-induced humoral immunity against HIV using systems serology.Cell. 2015; 163: 988-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), we profiled 70 Ab features associated with Fc effector activity and identified differential Ab glycosylation and functional profiles that distinguished Ltb from Atb. Moreover, Abs isolated from Ltb enhanced human macrophage control of Mtb with increased phagolysosomal fusion, inflammasome activation, and lower bacterial burden in vitro compared to Atb. Together, these data highlight Ab glycosylation profiles as potential immune correlates of TB disease state and provide mechanistic insights into Ab Fc effector function in bacterial control. To broadly explore the humoral immune responses in TB disease, we profiled plasma derived IgG from HIV-negative individuals with Ltb (n = 22) or Atb (n = 20) (Table 1) from South Africa. We assessed 70 Ab features (Table S1), including the ability to recruit Ab-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Chung et al., 2015Chung A.W. Kumar M.P. Arnold K.B. Yu W.H. Schoen M.K. Dunphy L.J. Suscovich T.J. Frahm N. Linde C.

Principal-component analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 1986Jolliffe I. Principal Component Analysis. Spinrger Verlag, 1986Crossref Google Scholar) of the Ab features resolved divergent humoral immune profiles between the groups (Figure S1). Feature reduction (Tibshirani, 1997Tibshirani R. The lasso method for variable selection in the Cox model.Stat. Med. 1997; 16: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar) identified nine Ab characteristics as the minimal parameters that could separate the two disease states (Table 2, indicated by b). PCA using these nine features alone segregated the Ltb individuals (blue) toward the left of the x axis and Atb individuals (red) toward the right (Figure 1A). The mirror loadings plot (Figure 1B), where the relative location of an individual feature is associated with the geographical position of the corresponding disease state group on the dot plot (Figure 1A), highlighted differential Ab glycosylation as a feature that separated with both Ltb and Atb (Figure 1B, 3∧, 4∧, 8∧, and 18∧). After correction for multiple comparisons (Holm, 1979Holm S. A simple sequentially rejective multiple test procedure.Scand. J. Stat. 1979; 6: 65-70Crossref Google Scholar), the digalactosylated (G2) Ab glycoform was identified as the biomarker that best discriminated between the groups (Table 2, indicated by a).

The nine Ab features are represented in the loadings plot (B), a mirror image of the PCA dot plot, where the location of the Ab features reflects the distribution of the individuals in the dot plot (A). We next sought to define whether these differences in Ab Fc profiles were simply biomarkers of disease state or also contributed to immune activity against Mtb. Among the innate immune cells with potential antimicrobial function, we explored Ab activation of NK cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. On a per-PPD-specific Ab level, we observed that IgG from individuals with Ltb (n = 22) compared to Atb (n = 20) was associated with enhanced PPD-specific ADCC (Figures 2A, p = 0.0233, and S2) and NK cell degranulation (CD107a upregulation; Figure 2B, p = 0.0110). Likewise, consistent differences were observed for additional measures of NK cell activation including the secretion of MIP1β and IFNγ (Figures S3A and S3B). Ab-mediated phagocytosis of PPD-adsorbed beads trended higher in the presence of neutrophils (Figure 2C) and was significantly enhanced in Atb compared to Ltb in the presence of the monocytic cell line THP1 (Figures 2D, p = 0.0010, and S2). Similarly, enhanced monocyte-mediated phagocytosis was also observed in the presence of some, but not all, Mtb-culture-fraction-coated beads (Figure S3C–S3G; p values from 0.006 to 0.011), suggesting some selectivity in Ab function against particular antigens. To further assess antigen specificity, we generated two pools of Abs composed of purified polyclonal IgG from individuals within each disease group (Ltb, n = 22; Atb, n = 20). Depletion of PPD-specific Abs resulted in trends toward reduced ADCC and ADCP and significantly reduced ADNP (Figures S3H–S3J), supporting the antigen-specific nature of Ab effector activity. That bioactivity was not completely depleted may affirm immune complex biology where even low-affinity Abs that remain in the pools elicit some activity. Moreover, functional differences in ADCP were not observed with uncoated control beads (Figure 2E) or beads coated with an irrelevant pool of influenza hemagglutinin proteins (Figure 2F), against which IgG titers were similar or higher to those observed for PPD (Figure S3K), highlighting disease-specific differences in Ab Fc-effector function. Together, these lines of evidence suggest that distinct Ab effector profiles in Ltb and Atb can selectively recruit innate immune cell activity in an antigen-specific manner.Figure S2Gating Strategies for Ab-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis and Cellular Cytotoxicity, Related to Figures 2, S3, and STAR MethodsShow full caption(A) Ab dependent cellular phagocytosis of antigen adsorbed fluorescent beads was measured in THP1 monocytes.

Here, we show that perturbation of mesenchymal cells in a mouse model of the pre-leukemic disorder Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) induces mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and activation of DNA damage responses in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Massive parallel RNA sequencing of highly purified mesenchymal cells in the SDS mouse model and a range of human pre-leukemic syndromes identified p53-S100A8/9-TLR inflammatory signaling as a common driving mechanism of genotoxic stress. Transcriptional activation of this signaling axis in the mesenchymal niche predicted leukemic evolution and progression-free survival in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the principal leukemia predisposition syndrome. Collectively, our findings identify mesenchymal niche-induced genotoxic stress in heterotypic stem and progenitor cells through inflammatory signaling as a targetable determinant of disease outcome in human pre-leukemia."

The complex social and cognitive behaviors that characterize modern humans—including language, civilization, and society—reflect human-specific neurodevelopmental mechanisms that have both genetic and cultural roots (Miller et al., 2012Miller D.J.

The ability of comparative genomics to identify loci that are highly different between humans and other species promises to allow their association to some of these human-specific traits (McLean et al., 2011McLean C.Y.

The ultimate functional test of the importance of HARs comes in assessing the impact of deleterious mutations in HAR sequences, and virtually nothing is known about any potential functional effects of HAR mutations. Association of functional HAR mutations with disorders of cognition or social behavior could provide novel insights not only into the pathogenesis of important human disorders, but also into the mechanisms by which human-specific patterns of social and cognitive behavior originated. The apparent loss of negative evolutionary pressure on HARs between humans and other primates could reflect any of three potential processes: neutral substitutions accumulating in sequences that have lost essential function, guanine-cytosine (GC)-biased gene-conversion events, or a switch from strictly negative selection to include positive selection. Variation in healthy individuals and close hominin relatives suggests that rare mutations in HARs are generally deleterious, reflected in a paucity of recent alleles (i.e., non-ancestral alleles, 8.3%) and fixation of 96% of ancestral alleles (Burbano et al., 2012Burbano H.A. Green R.E. Maricic T. Lalueza-Fox C. de la Rasilla M. Rosas A. Kelso J. Pollard K.S. Lachmann M. Pääbo S. Analysis of human accelerated DNA regions using archaic hominin genomes.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e32877Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it appears that at least some HARs underwent a switch to positive selection in humans, possibly followed by a switch back to negative selection within stable human populations. Several recent studies have elucidated potential functions of HARs using in silico predictions and animal models. Most HARs lie within 1 Mb of a gene and show enrichment for CTCF binding, suggesting that some HARs act as transcriptional enhancers through physical contact with promoters (Capra et al., 2013Capra J.A. Erwin G.D. McKinsey G. Rubenstein J.L. Pollard K.S. Many human accelerated regions are developmental enhancers.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2013; 368: 20130025Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Other HARs, such as HAR1, appear to encode RNAs (Pollard et al., 2006bPollard K.S. Salama S.R. Lambert N. Lambot M.A. Coppens S. Pedersen J.S. Katzman S. King B. Onodera C. Siepel A. et al.An RNA gene expressed during cortical development evolved rapidly in humans.Nature. 2006; 443: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The enrichment of epigenetic signatures suggests that 29% of HARs function as enhancers during brain, heart, and limb development (Capra et al., 2013Capra J.A. Erwin G.D. McKinsey G. Rubenstein J.L. Pollard K.S. Many human accelerated regions are developmental enhancers.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2013; 368: 20130025Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Transgenic constructs encoding human or chimpanzee HAR sequences revealed species-specific functionality through expression levels or, in some cases, changes in anatomical regions of expression (Capra et al., 2013Capra J.A. Erwin G.D. McKinsey G. Rubenstein J.L. Pollard K.S. Many human accelerated regions are developmental enhancers.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2013; 368: 20130025Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, definitive proof of essential HARs requires the characterization of functional HAR mutations in humans, i.e., by the association with genetic disease. In recent years, focus on regulatory mutations causing disease has increased, resulting in the identification of a handful of noncoding mutations. Unlike coding mutations, which are most often loss of function, regulatory mutations have the potential to be activating or inactivating of gene transcription in specific tissues (Bae et al., 2014Bae B.I. Tietjen I. Atabay K.D. Evrony G.D. Johnson M.B. Asare E. Wang P.P. Murayama A.Y. Im K.

Lango Allen H. et al.International Pancreatic Agenesis ConsortiumRecessive mutations in a distal PTF1A enhancer cause isolated pancreatic agenesis.Nat. Genet. 2014; 46: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), typically due to gain or loss of essential transcription factor (TF) motifs. Regulatory mutations, including both biallelic and heterozygous, underlie a variety of human diseases (Weedon et al., 2014Weedon M.N. Cebola I. Patch A.M. Flanagan S.E. De Franco E. Caswell R. Rodríguez-Seguí S.A. Shaw-Smith C. Cho C.H. Lango Allen H. et al.International Pancreatic Agenesis ConsortiumRecessive mutations in a distal PTF1A enhancer cause isolated pancreatic agenesis.Nat. Genet. 2014; 46: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The strong preservation of HARs between species identifies them as likely to be genetically essential and, hence, as favorable targets to identify undiscovered disease-associated mutations. A subset of HARs shows evidence of neural function, with several within loci with significant associations to schizophrenia (Xu et al., 2015Xu K. Schadt E.E. Pollard K.S. Roussos P. Dudley J.T. Genomic and network patterns of schizophrenia genetic variation in human evolutionary accelerated regions.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2015; 32: 1148-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GABAergic and glutamatergic genes were enriched among the HAR-associated schizophrenia genes. Interestingly, HAR-associated genes were enriched for processes involved in synaptic formation and exhibit a higher connectivity to regulatory networks in the prefrontal cortex (Xu et al., 2015Xu K. Schadt E.E. Pollard K.S. Roussos P. Dudley J.T. Genomic and network patterns of schizophrenia genetic variation in human evolutionary accelerated regions.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2015; 32: 1148-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An intronic HAR with enhancer activity within AUTS2, a gene linked to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Oksenberg et al., 2013Oksenberg N. Stevison L. Wall J.D. Ahituv N. Function and regulation of AUTS2, a gene implicated in autism and human evolution.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003221Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggests that HAR variants could result in ASD, but no HAR mutations have yet been associated with any neurological diseases. We utilized existing genomic data from healthy individuals and the Epigenomics Roadmap to demonstrate essential regulatory functions of HARs, particularly in neural tissues. We also performed 4C-sequencing, in combination with existing interaction data, to provide the first systematic map of target genes for more than 500 HARs. We investigated the mutational landscape of HARs by comparing de novo copy-number variations (CNVs) and biallelic point mutations in individuals with ASD and healthy controls, revealing a significant contribution of both types of mutations to ASD risk. We identify several specific HARs likely to have essential functions in the human brain that are potentially important targets of recent human brain evolution. We investigated HARs for evidence of transcriptional regulatory functions by first defining their mutational landscape in healthy, diverse human populations. We identified 2,737 HARs from several recent publications (Bird et al., 2007Bird C.P. Stranger B.E. Liu M. Thomas D.J. Ingle C.E. Beazley C. Miller W. Hurles M.E. Dermitzakis E.T.

Due in part to the identification methods, most HARs lie in intergenic and intronic noncoding regions (Figure S1), although several overlap promoters (48) or noncoding RNAs and pseudogenes (135). Within the Complete Genomics Diversity Panel (CG69) and low-coverage 1000 Genomes project (1000G), individual “HAR-omes” contain an average of 1,273 variants, with a 2-fold depletion of rare variants compared to coding, noncoding-conserved, and randomly selected loci (2.1% versus 4.5%, p = 4.2 × 10−44; 5.2%, p = 4.7 × 10−70; and 4.8%, p = 2.0 × 10−76; Table S2 and Figure 1A). While common HAR alleles exhibit a significant elevation in homozygosity (Figures 1B and S2), rare alleles are depleted for homozygosity, particularly for conserved nucleotides where they behave similar to coding mutations, suggesting possible damaging effects (Figure 1C).Figure 1Evidence of Selective Pressures due to Regulatory Functionality of HARsShow full caption(A–C) Average distribution of variants by maximum AF in CG69.

See also Figures S1 and S2 and Tables S1 and S2. To explore whether HAR variants occur at human-specific bases, we compared alleles from 1000G to their respective chimpanzee base, revealing that 11% occur at human-specific nucleotides within 1,401 HARs. While human-specific sites account for about 2% of HAR nucleotides, they are enriched for point mutations, including 690 rare alleles (2,255 of 12,973 sites; odds ratio [OR] = 6.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3–6.9, p < 10−4), and display evidence of evolutionary constraint (i.e., fewer substitutions than expected by neutral models; average GERP-RS = 2.23) (Cooper et al., 2005Cooper G.M.

NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramDistribution and intensity of constraint in mammalian genomic sequence.Genome Res. 2005; 15: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). While enrichment of alleles at human-specific sites might represent recent mutational events or, more likely, polymorphic non-accelerated sites, 365 alleles do not revert to ancestral alleles, suggesting that a portion have been subject to recent mutations. We expanded recent in silico predictions of developmental activity (Capra et al., 2013Capra J.A. Erwin G.D. McKinsey G. Rubenstein J.L. Pollard K.S. Many human accelerated regions are developmental enhancers.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

HARs show significant enrichment for fetal and adult brain H3K4me1 profiles (p < 0.0001), suggesting activity in the brain (Figure 1D). Furthermore, 81% of HARs overlapped marks of active transcription, promoters, or enhancers, including 45% in neural samples from ChromHMM (Figure 1E and Table S1), with many displaying tissue specificity (i.e., 168 in neural tissues). We sought to define the TF motif landscape of HARs beyond the known enrichment for conserved TF sites (TFBS; Capra et al., 2013Capra J.A. Erwin G.D. McKinsey G. Rubenstein J.L. Pollard K.S.

Baertsch R. et al.Forces shaping the fastest evolving regions in the human genome.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e168Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). HARs were enriched for TFBSs (78%, p < 0.0001, random sampling; Figure 1F) and high-quality predicted matrices (2.5-fold increase, 15,989 sites [Figure 1G]). Several enriched motifs are involved in neural developmental processes, including MEF2A (p = 4.8 × 10−5) and the SRY-related HMG-box gene 2 (SOX2) (p = 2.9 × 10−7) (Figure 1H), while others, like ZNF333, show broader expression. SOX2 is expressed in stem cells, where it is essential for renewal of neural progenitors (Ferri et al., 2004Ferri A.L. Cavallaro M. Braida D. Di Cristofano A. Canta A. Vezzani A. Ottolenghi S. Pandolfi P.P. Sala M. DeBiasi S. Nicolis S.K.

Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 93: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Upon decreased SOX2 expression, neural progenitors differentiate into neurons. The enrichment of SOX2 motifs supports a role in neural development, particularly during neurogenesis. Human-specific nucleotides altered the frequencies of some motifs (54 increased, 72 decreased, Figure 1I), including REST, CTCF, and NFIA. This divergence of TF motifs may reveal human-specific processes in cortical development. We combined existing ChIA-PET and HiC data (Goh et al., 2012Goh Y. Fullwood M.J. Poh H.M. Peh S.Q. Ong C.T.

Ay F. Lee C. Gulsoy G. Deng X. Cook S. Hesson J. Cavanaugh C. Ware C.B. Krumm A. et al.Fine-scale chromatin interaction maps reveal the cis-regulatory landscape of human lincRNA genes.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar; Table S1). More than 42% of HARs interact with flanking gene promoters, suggesting that proximity is generally a good predictor of HAR target genes in lieu of cell-type-specific interaction data. Of the 132 target genes overlapping OMIM disorders, 28 associate with ASD/ID (p = 0.008, random sampling, Table S3 and Figure 2A) and 38 cause neural phenotypes in mice. Since regulatory elements alter gene-expression levels, but not protein structure, we hypothesized that, for pathogenicity, target genes should be dosage sensitive, i.e., haploinsufficiency (HI). Indeed, the HI (Huang et al., 2010Huang N. Lee I. Marcotte E.M. Hurles M.E. Characterising and predicting haploinsufficiency in the human genome.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001154Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) of flanking and target genes are significantly elevated (i.e., dosage sensitive; HI = 0.35, p = 3.8 × 10−38; HI = 0.34, p = 9.0 × 10−13; t test; Figure 2B). The elevated dosage sensitivity is especially prominent for genes flanking neurally active HARs (HI = 0.42, p = 4.5 × 10−14, t test; Figure 2B). In comparison, sampling of conserved noncoding and random genomic elements revealed an average HI of 0.33 and 0.31, respectively. Additionally, gene constraint scores (pLI) (Lek et al., 2015Lek M. Karczewski K.J. Minikel E.V. Samocha K.E. Banks E. Fennell T. O’Donnell-Luria A.H. Ware J.S. Hill A.J. Cummings B.B. et al.Analysis of protein-coding genetic variation in 60,706 humans.Nature. 2015; 536: 285-291Crossref Scopus (6554) Google Scholar) of flanking and target genes are elevated (pLI = 0.42, p < 0.001; and 0.40, p < 0.001; random sampling). Together, HI and pLI scores suggest that HARs might provide a novel source of dosage regulation for highly constrained and haplosensitive genes. The constraint of genes flanking (i.e., closest upstream and downstream) HARs suggests an important role and possibly an enrichment in specific essential biological functions. Consistent with prior studies, HAR genes were enriched for involvement in neural development, neuronal differentiation, and axonogenesis (Figure 2D and Table S4). Even more, HAR genes are highly enriched for mammalian phenotypes such as abnormal brain morphology (p = 2.3 × 10−27, Figure 2C). Strikingly, genes near HARs were enriched for associations in the Genetic Association Database of Diseases with ASD (p = 0.03), schizophrenia (p = 0.001), and autonomic nervous system functions (p = 0.01), including AUTS2, CDKL5, FOXP1, MEF2C, NRXN1, and SMARCA2. The functional characteristics of HARs suggest that, when mutated, they have the potential to negatively impact behavioral and cognitive functions. Our analysis of CNVs in 2,100 sibling-matched ASD probands from the Simons Simplex Collection (Sanders et al., 2015Sanders S.J. He X. Willsey A.J. Ercan-Sencicek A.G. Samocha K.E. Cicek A.E.

In contrast, no significant difference was observed for inherited HAR-containing CNVs. Gender analyses revealed an excess of de novo CNVs affecting HARs in females (OR 2.48, p = 0.008) but no significant difference for unaffected individuals (p = 0.4). While many reported CNVs are large and impact exons, we identified two intergenic de novo HAR-containing CNVs in probands, but none in healthy siblings. Interestingly, a de novo duplication is located 300 kb upstream of nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group F, member 2 (NR2F2 or COUP-TFII), where existing data reveal an interaction between the NR2F2 promoter and the duplicated HAR (Figure 3B). CNVs of NR2F2 occur in individuals with ASD and ID, as well as heart defects (Nava et al., 2014Nava C. Keren B. Mignot C. Rastetter A. Chantot-Bastaraud S. Faudet A. Fonteneau E. Amiet C. Laurent C.

https://openalex.org/W2521836369,"An influential striatal model postulates that neural activities in the striatal direct and indirect pathways promote and inhibit movement, respectively. Normal behavior requires coordinated activity in the direct pathway to facilitate intended locomotion and indirect pathway to inhibit unwanted locomotion. In this striatal model, neuronal population activity is assumed to encode locomotion relevant information. Here, we propose a novel encoding mechanism for the dorsal striatum. We identified spatially compact neural clusters in both the direct and indirect pathways. Detailed characterization revealed similar cluster organization between the direct and indirect pathways, and cluster activities from both pathways were correlated with mouse locomotion velocities. Using machine-learning algorithms, cluster activities could be used to decode locomotion relevant behavioral states and locomotion velocity. We propose that neural clusters in the dorsal striatum encode locomotion relevant information and that coordinated activities of direct and indirect pathway neural clusters are required for normal striatal controlled behavior. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2525843044,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are prevalent genes with frequently precise regulation but mostly unknown functions. Here we demonstrate that lncRNAs guide the organismal DNA damage response. DNA damage activated transcription of the DINO (Damage Induced Noncoding) lncRNA via p53. DINO was required for p53-dependent gene expression, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage, and DINO expression was sufficient to activate damage signaling and cell cycle arrest in the absence of DNA damage. DINO bound to p53 protein and promoted its stabilization, mediating a p53 auto-amplification loop. Dino knockout or promoter inactivation in mice dampened p53 signaling and ameliorated acute radiation syndrome in vivo. Thus, inducible lncRNA can create a feedback loop with its cognate transcription factor to amplify cellular signaling networks."

Our results support a model by which drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in the VP mediates opposing behavioral symptoms; targeting the VP may provide novel therapeutic strategies for addictive disorders. With repeated cocaine consumption, positive and negative symptoms accumulate to form a syndrome that is eventually diagnosed as addiction. The acute reinforcing effects of addictive drugs are mediated by dopamine (DA) release from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Di Chiara and Imperato, 1988Di Chiara G. Imperato A. Drugs abused by humans preferentially increase synaptic dopamine concentrations in the mesolimbic system of freely moving rats.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The addicted state is defined by compulsive drug taking, driven by craving and the emergence of a negative affective state (Le Moal and Koob, 2007Le Moal M. Koob G.F.

Drug craving is a pathologically strong drug-associated memory that is precipitated by exposure to drug-associated cues and contexts and drives drug taking even after long periods of abstinence (Kalivas et al., 1998Kalivas P.W.

The emergence of a negative affective state after prolonged withdrawal also drives drug taking, which can relieve this aversive state through negative reinforcement. One prominent feature of this state is anhedonia (Le Moal and Koob, 2007Le Moal M. Koob G.F. Drug addiction: pathways to the disease and pathophysiological perspectives.Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 2007; 17: 377-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).

Considerable evidence implicates cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity on medium spiny neurons that express D1 receptors (D1-MSNs) in drug reinforcement (Creed et al., 2015Creed M. Pascoli V.J.

Conversely, activity of the indirect pathway, which is modulated by DA acting on cells that express D2 receptors (D2-MSNs), is linked to aversion (Danjo et al., 2014Danjo T. Yoshimi K. Funabiki K.

Psychiatry. 2016; 79: 898-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the involvement of D2-MSNs in anhedonia arising after cocaine withdrawal is undetermined. While there is evidence to support divergent roles of D1- and D2-MSNs in cocaine-induced behaviors, the synaptic basis of these adaptations is not known, nor is it clear which downstream target(s) of MSNs are implicated in maladaptive behaviors. The ventral pallidum (VP) is a major target of the NAc (Heimer and Wilson, 1975Heimer L. Wilson R.D. The subcortical projections of allocortex: similarities in the neural associations of the hippocampus, the piriform cortex and the neocortex.in: Santini M. Golgi Centennial Symposium Proceedings. Raven Press, 1975: 173-193Google Scholar), receiving innervation from D1- and D2-MSNs (Kupchik et al., 2015Kupchik Y.M. Brown R.M. Heinsbroek J.A. Lobo M.K. Schwartz D.J. Kalivas P.W. Coding the direct/indirect pathways by D1 and D2 receptors is not valid for accumbens projections.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1230-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). VP neurons robustly respond to reward and reward-predictive cues (Tindell et al., 2005Tindell A.J. Berridge K.C. Zhang J. Peciña S. Aldridge J.W. Ventral pallidal neurons code incentive motivation: amplification by mesolimbic sensitization and amphetamine.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 2617-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), while VP lesions reduce hedonic impact and motivation for reward (Cromwell and Berridge, 1993Cromwell H.C. Berridge K.C. Where does damage lead to enhanced food aversion: the ventral pallidum/substantia innominata or lateral hypothalamus?.Brain Res. 1993; 624: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The VP has also been directly implicated in drug-adaptive behavior (Robledo and Koob, 1993Robledo P. Koob G.F. Two discrete nucleus accumbens projection areas differentially mediate cocaine self-administration in the rat.Behav. Brain Res. 1993; 55: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Root et al., 2013Root D.H. Ma S. Barker D.J. Megehee L. Striano B.M. Ralston C.M. Fabbricatore A.T. West M.O. Differential roles of ventral pallidum subregions during cocaine self-administration behaviors.J. Comp. Neurol. 2013; 521: 558-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); a subset of VP neurons project to the VTA, where they modulate activity of VTA and GABA neurons and mediate drug seeking (Mahler et al., 2014Mahler S.V. Vazey E.M. Beckley J.T. Keistler C.R. McGlinchey E.M. Kaufling J. Wilson S.P. Deisseroth K. Woodward J.J. Aston-Jones G. Designer receptors show role for ventral pallidum input to ventral tegmental area in cocaine seeking.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Despite evidence implicating the NAc and VP in reward-related behavior, how addictive drugs affect plasticity between the NAc and VP, and how this plasticity contributes to drug-adaptive behavior, remains largely unknown. Here, we propose a model by which cocaine potentiates and depresses D1- and D2-MSN inputs from the NAc to VP, respectively. We characterize divergent forms of homosynaptic plasticity at D1- and D2-MSN-to-VP synapses, which are presynaptically expressed and occluded by cocaine treatment. We selectively normalize transmission at these synapses to establish causal links between D1 projections and behavioral sensitization to cocaine, and between D2 projections and the emergence of anhedonia. Together, our data support a model whereby the VP integrates rewarding and aversive signals from the NAc that govern distinct behavioral symptoms of addictive disorders. To determine the effect of cocaine on inhibitory transmission in the VP, we used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute brain slices from adult mice. We first recorded electrically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from VP cells from mice that received five injections of saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p. [intraperitoneally]), followed by 10 days of withdrawal (Figure S1A, available online). Here, we focused exclusively on the ventromedial (vm) subdivision of the VP, which is innervated by MSNs from the shell of the NAc and sends projections to the VTA (Haber et al., 1985Haber S.N. Groenewegen H.J. Grove E.A. Nauta W.J. Efferent connections of the ventral pallidum: evidence of a dual striato pallidofugal pathway.J. Comp. Neurol. 1985; 235: 322-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) to induce long-term plasticity of inhibitory transmission onto VP neurons. Consistent with previous reports (Kupchik et al., 2014Kupchik Y.M. Scofield M.D. Rice K.C. Cheng K. Roques B.P. Kalivas P.W. Cocaine dysregulates opioid gating of GABA neurotransmission in the ventral pallidum.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), HFS (100 pulses at 100 Hz, 20 s ISI) induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of IPSCs in saline-treated mice, whereas HFS failed to induce LTP in slices from cocaine-treated mice (Figures S1B and S1C). This failure to induce LTP was also apparent in mice that had self-administered cocaine, indicating that this plasticity is evoked by contingent or non-contingent exposure (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The NAc is considered the predominant source of inhibitory input to the VP (Heimer and Wilson, 1975Heimer L. Wilson R.D. The subcortical projections of allocortex: similarities in the neural associations of the hippocampus, the piriform cortex and the neocortex.in: Santini M. Golgi Centennial Symposium Proceedings. Raven Press, 1975: 173-193Google Scholar). To resolve the neurons that contribute to the potentiation of inhibitory transmission in the VP after cocaine exposure, we first characterized the nature of the NAc-to-VP projection with optogenetic-assisted circuit mapping. In the dorsal striatum, D1- and D2-MSNs have largely segregated projection patterns, with D1-MSNs projecting to the substantia nigra and D2-MSNs projecting to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (Alexander et al., 1990Alexander G.E. Crutcher M.D. DeLong M.R. Basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits: parallel substrates for motor, oculomotor, “prefrontal” and “limbic” functions.Prog. Brain Res. 1990; 85: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). However, this segregation is not necessarily observed at the level of the NAc (Kupchik et al., 2015Kupchik Y.M. Brown R.M. Heinsbroek J.A. Lobo M.K. Schwartz D.J. Kalivas P.W. Coding the direct/indirect pathways by D1 and D2 receptors is not valid for accumbens projections.Nat.

Neurol. 1990; 302: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and the proportion of D1- and D2-MSNs from the NAc shell to vmVP is not known. To address this, we injected the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) into the vmVP of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing a reporter protein under the control of the D1R or D2R promoter and analyzed sections of the NAc shell (Figures 1A–1C). In D1-To (D1-Tomato) mice, of 500 MSNs positive for CTB, 282 were also positive for the D1-To reporter protein, and in D2-eGFP mice, 229/500 CTB-positive MSNs also expressed the D2-eGPF reporter (Figure 1D), indicating that D1- and D2-MSNs from the NAc shell equally project to the vmVP. We assayed the functional connectivity of D1- and D2-MSNs to the vmVP by injecting floxed ChR2 into the NAc shell of D1R- or D2R-Cre mice and recording light-evoked responses in vmVP cells (Figure 1E). We found that 92.8% of vmVP cells received innervation from D1-MSNs, while 75.0% of vmVP cells were innervated by D2-MSNs. Currents were GABAA mediated, as they were blocked by picrotoxin, with no differences in the release probability of D1- versus D2-MSN synapses (Figures 1F and 1G). Together, these experiments indicate that D1- and D2-MSNs in the NAc shell project in equal proportion to the vmVP, where they innervate large, overlapping populations of postsynaptic neurons. Since D1- and D2-MSNs undergo distinct adaptations following cocaine (Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2008Bertran-Gonzalez J. Bosch C. Maroteaux M. Matamales M. Hervé D. Valjent E. Girault J.A.

We selectively transfected the two classes of MSNs by injecting a floxed chETA construct into the NAc shell of D1- or D2-Cre mice. The VP is composed of interneurons and projection neurons with varied targets (Root et al., 2015Root D.H. Melendez R.I. Zaborszky L. Napier T.C.

Designer receptors show role for ventral pallidum input to ventral tegmental area in cocaine seeking.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We therefore selectively recorded from this population, which was identified by injecting the retrograde tracer CTB555 into the VTA (Figures 2A and 2B ). Connectivity rates between MSNs and this subpopulation of VP neurons were similar to connectivity rates observed in the entire VP (connectivity, 222/256 D1-Cre and 263/329 D2-Cre mice). In saline-treated mice, HFS (Figure 2C) induced LTP of inhibitory transmission at D1-MSN-to-VP synapses (Figure 2D), analogous to what we have previously observed at D1-MSN synapses onto GABAergic neurons of the VTA (Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C. Pascoli V. Wong J.C. House D.R. Yvon C. de Roo M. Tan K.R. Lüscher C. Cocaine disinhibits dopamine neurons by potentiation of GABA transmission in the ventral tegmental area.Science. 2013; 341: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Conversely, the same protocol applied at D2-MSN-to-VP synapses induced a long-term depression (LTD) of inhibitory transmission (Figure 2E). In cocaine-treated mice, HFS failed to alter the amplitude of evoked inhibitory transmission at either D1- or D2-MSN-to-VP synapses (Figures 2D and 2E). Cocaine treatment was associated with a presynaptic facilitation of release probability at D1-MSN synapses and a presynaptic depression of release probability of D2-MSN synapses (Figure 2F). This cocaine-evoked plasticity was not apparent on the first day of withdrawal from cocaine (Figure S2), suggesting that an incubation period is required for the occlusion of activity-dependent plasticity at NAc-to-VP synapses. In further support of an occlusion mechanism, we performed recordings of light-evoked currents in strontium, an established method to desynchronize release and reveal quantal events (Patton et al., 2016Patton M.H. Roberts B.M. Lovinger D.M. Mathur B.N. Ethanol disinhibits dorsolateral striatal medium spiny neurons through activation of a presynaptic delta opioid receptor.Neuropsychopharm. 2016; 41: 1831-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 1999Xu-Friedman M.A. Regehr W.G. Presynaptic strontium dynamics and synaptic transmission.Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2029-2042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), (Figures S3A and S3B). There were no differences in event amplitude between saline- or cocaine-treated mice (Figure S3C). However, in D1-Cre mice, cocaine treatment increased the average number of events per light pulse, suggesting an increase in release sites. Conversely, the average number of events per light pulse was decreased at D2-MSN-to-VP synapses in cocaine-treated mice (Figure S3D). Occlusion of activity-dependent plasticity by cocaine suggests that these forms of plasticity share common underlying mechanisms. We therefore sought to determine the expression mechanisms underlying these two forms of activity-dependent plasticity at NAc-to-VP synapses. We selectively targeted D1-MSNs with chETA and measured light-evoked currents in VTA-projecting VP cells. We confirmed that HFS induced an LTP, which was insensitive to inclusion of the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) in the patch pipette (Figure 3A). In further support of a presynaptic mechanism of this homosynaptic plasticity, we observed that HFS induced a decrease in the failure rate and paired-pulse ratio (PPR), and increase in the variance of inhibitory currents (Figures 3B and 3C). This is reminiscent of a form of inhibitory plasticity at D1-MSN-to-VTA GABA neuron synapses that is presynaptically mediated, protein kinase A (PKA) and D1R dependent, and also occluded by cocaine treatment (Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C. Pascoli V. Wong J.C. House D.R. Yvon C. de Roo M. Tan K.R. Lüscher C. Cocaine disinhibits dopamine neurons by potentiation of GABA transmission in the ventral tegmental area.Science. 2013; 341: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We confirmed that at D1-MSN-to-VP synapses, HFS-induced LTP was prevented by incubation in the D1 antagonist SCH23390 or the PKA activator forskolin (FSK; Figure 3D). In support of an occlusion mechanism by cocaine, FSK application induced an LTP of inhibitory transmission that was completely absent in cocaine-treated mice (Figure 3E). Application of FSK also induced an LTP of transmission at D2-MSN-to-VP synapses (Figure 3F). These results confirm that HFS-induced LTP at D1-MSN-to-VP synapses is presynaptic, and D1R and PKA mediated, whereas HFS differentially affects plasticity at D1- and D2-MSN-to-VP synapses through divergent mechanisms. We confirmed that HFS induced an LTD of transmission at D2-MSN-to-VP synapses. This plasticity was insensitive to postsynaptic BAPTA (Figure 4A) and was associated with an increase in the failure rate and PPR (Figures 4B and 4C). How can a single stimulation protocol induce divergent forms of plasticity at D1- and D2-MSN-to-VP synapses? In addition to the DA receptors, the two populations of MSNs differ in their expression of endogenous opioids and receptors. Specifically, D1-MSNs release dynorphin (an endogenous κ-ligand) and express μ-opioid receptors, whereas D2-MSNs release enkephalin (an endogenous δ-ligand) and express both the δ- and κ-opioid receptors (Gerfen et al., 1990Gerfen C.R. Engber T.M. Mahan L.C. Susel Z. Chase T.N. Monsma Jr., F.J. Sibley D.R.

Through this mechanism, enkephalin decreases the probability of transmitter release from the presynaptic terminal, which may be long lasting (Patton et al., 2016Patton M.H. Roberts B.M. Lovinger D.M. Mathur B.N.

Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1734-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Application of the selective DOR agonist, DPDPE, induced an LTD of D2-MSN-to-VP transmission. The long-lasting nature of this plasticity was confirmed by chasing DPDPE with the DOR antagonist naltrindol (NAL). DPDPE failed to induce an LTD at D2-MSN-to-VP synapses in cocaine-treated mice, supporting an occlusion scenario (Figure 4D). Further implicating DORs in HFS-induced LTD, we applied HFS following incubation with NAL; in this condition of DOR antagonism, HFS failed to induce an LTD (Figure 4E). Previous studies have reported that enkephalin levels in the reward system are sensitive to drug administration (Crespo et al., 2001Crespo J.A. Manzanares J. Oliva J.M. Corchero J. Palomo T. Ambrosio E. Extinction of cocaine self-administration produces a differential time-related regulation of proenkephalin gene expression in rat brain.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2001; 25: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that HFS failed to induce an LTD after cocaine due to a change in tonic levels of enkephalin, we quantified levels of enkephalin in the NAc and VP (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) but found no evidence for a decrease in enkephalin levels in the VP following cocaine treatment (Figures S4A and S4B). Finally, this mechanism was unique to D2-MSN-to-VP synapses, since DPDPE had no effect on inhibitory transmission at D1-MSN-to-VP synapses. Given that D1-MSNs express the μ-opioid receptor, we confirmed that D1-MSN-to-VP synapses were depressed by application of the selective μ-opioid receptor agonist, DAMGO (Figure 4F). These results suggest that activity-dependent LTD occurs at D2-MSN-, but not D1-MSN-to-VP synapses, due to enkephalin co-release. This plasticity is presynaptically expressed, DOR mediated, and occluded by cocaine treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2526187074,"Cellular heterogeneity can emerge from the expression of only one parental allele. However, it has remained controversial whether, or to what degree, random monoallelic expression of autosomal genes (aRME) is mitotically inherited (clonal) or stochastic (dynamic) in somatic cells, particularly in vivo. Here we used allele-sensitive single-cell RNA-seq on clonal primary mouse fibroblasts and freshly isolated human CD8+ T cells to dissect clonal and dynamic monoallelic expression patterns. Dynamic aRME affected a considerable portion of the cells' transcriptomes, with levels dependent on the cells' transcriptional activity. Notably, clonal aRME was detected, but it was surprisingly scarce (<1% of genes) and mainly affected the most weakly expressed genes. Consequently, the overwhelming majority of aRME occurs transiently within individual cells, and patterns of aRME are thus primarily scattered throughout somatic cell populations rather than, as previously hypothesized, confined to patches of clonally related cells."
https://openalex.org/W2521223951,"<h2>Summary</h2> The generation of distinct hematopoietic cell types, including tissue-resident immune cells, distinguishes fetal from adult hematopoiesis. However, the mechanisms underlying differential cell production to generate a layered immune system during hematopoietic development are unclear. Using an irreversible lineage-tracing model, we identify a definitive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) that supports long-term multilineage reconstitution upon transplantation into adult recipients but does not persist into adulthood in situ. These HSCs are fully multipotent, yet they display both higher lymphoid cell production and greater capacity to generate innate-like B and T lymphocytes as compared to coexisting fetal HSCs and adult HSCs. Thus, these developmentally restricted HSCs (drHSCs) define the origin and generation of early lymphoid cells that play essential roles in establishing self-recognition and tolerance, with important implications for understanding autoimmune disease, allergy, and rejection of transplanted organs."

https://openalex.org/W2521226047,"Cognition requires the dynamic modulation of effective connectivity, i.e., the modulation of the postsynaptic neuronal response to a given input. If postsynaptic neurons are rhythmically active, this might entail rhythmic gain modulation, such that inputs synchronized to phases of high gain benefit from enhanced effective connectivity. We show that visually induced gamma-band activity in awake macaque area V4 rhythmically modulates responses to unpredictable stimulus events. This modulation exceeded a simple additive superposition of a constant response onto ongoing gamma-rhythmic firing, demonstrating the modulation of multiplicative gain. Gamma phases leading to strongest neuronal responses also led to shortest behavioral reaction times, suggesting functional relevance of the effect. Furthermore, we find that constant optogenetic stimulation of anesthetized cat area 21a produces gamma-band activity entailing a similar gain modulation. As the gamma rhythm in area 21a did not spread backward to area 17, this suggests that postsynaptic gamma is sufficient for gain modulation."

Neurogenic bladder dysfunction and central neuropathic pain (CNP) are among the most debilitating sequelae for those with chronic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) (Anderson, 2004Anderson K.D. Targeting recovery: priorities of the spinal cord-injured population.J. Neurotrauma. 2004; 21: 1371-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). A shared hallmark in the pathophysiology of both conditions is an imbalance between plasticity-mediated neuronal hyperexcitability and hypofunction of GABAergic tone (de Groat et al., 2015de Groat W.C.

Transplantation of GABAergic interneuron precursors offers a novel approach to mitigate neuronal hyperexcitability. In the developing brain, cortical interneuron precursors arise from the ventral telencephalic area, including the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) (Wichterle et al., 1999Wichterle H. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Herrera D.G. Alvarez-Buylla A. Young neurons from medial ganglionic eminence disperse in adult and embryonic brain.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These precursor cells migrate over long distances in the brain, survive, and differentiate into GABAergic interneurons, forming neural circuits and augmenting GABAergic tone (Southwell et al., 2014Southwell D.G.

Here we examine the utility of MGE-like cells, derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC-MGEs), as a potentially clinically relevant strategy for the treatment of SCI. We investigated the efficacy of hESC-MGEs, transplanted into the lumbar cord at 2 weeks after a thoracic SCI. Transplanted hESC-MGEs differentiated into GABAergic neuron subtypes, formed synaptic connections within the local circuitry, and alleviated long-term neurogenic bladder dysfunction and CNP. This study suggests the feasibility of treating subacute SCIs by increasing inhibitory input to local lumbar circuitry. The HES-3 hemizygous NKX2.1 (GFP/w) human embryonic stem cell line, with GFP inserted into an NKX2.1 allele, was differentiated into MGE-like cells as previously described (Nicholas et al., 2013Nicholas C.R. Chen J. Tang Y. Southwell D.G. Chalmers N. Vogt D. Arnold C.M. Chen Y.J. Stanley E.G. Elefanty A.G. et al.Functional maturation of hPSC-derived forebrain interneurons requires an extended timeline and mimics human neural development.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). By 2–3 weeks of differentiation, plated spheroids displayed robust expression of the NKX2.1-GFP ventral forebrain reporter (Figure 1A). Cultures were analyzed at 5–6 weeks post-differentiation by triple immunocytochemistry. Consistent with an MGE telencephalic-type lineage, GFP+ cells co-expressed the MGE progenitor marker OLIG2 (Figure 1B), but not the ventral hypothalamic marker NKX2.2 (Figure S1A). While OLIG2+ MGE progenitors in the fetal brain have the bipotential capacity to generate both GABAergic neurons and oligodendroglia, GFP+ cells co-expressed the GABAergic neuronal markers DLX2 (Figure 1B) and LHX6 (Figure S1A), suggesting differentiation toward an inhibitory neuron fate (Petryniak et al., 2007Petryniak M.A. Potter G.B. Rowitch D.H. Rubenstein J.L. Dlx1 and Dlx2 control neuronal versus oligodendroglial cell fate acquisition in the developing forebrain.Neuron. 2007; 55: 417-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). At ∼6–8 weeks of differentiation, cultures were dissociated to single cells and prepared for transplantation into the mouse spinal cord. Prior to transplantation, MGE-like neuronal precursor cell enrichment was performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) gating for NKX2.1-GFP and PSA-NCAM. The GFP+ gate was set to select NKX2.1-GFP+-high population (Figure 1C). Of the GFP+-high population, cells expressing PSA-NCAM above control levels (isotype antibody) were selected for transplantation (Figure 1D). To assess long-term consequences of cell transplantation, we tested two doses of hESC-MGEs in uninjured mice, 300,000 cells/mouse (low dose) or 600,000–800,000 cells/mouse (high dose) (Figure S1B). Repeated assessments over a period of 6 months revealed similar gains in body weight between transplanted and vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, cell transplantation into the lumbar enlargement (the site of the central pattern generator) did not alter gross or fine locomotor patterns, based on the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) score and subscore, respectively (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1C). Since the transplantation site (L3–L5) was in close proximity to the rodent spinal micturition centers (L6–S1), we next assessed bladder function by conscious cystometry at 6 months post-transplantation or vehicle injection. Representative cystometry recordings for animals in each treatment group are shown in Figures 1G–1I. Elevated maximal voiding pressure, a functional consequence of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (Panicker et al., 2015Panicker J.N. Fowler C.J. Kessler T.M. Lower urinary tract dysfunction in the neurological patient: clinical assessment and management.Lancet Neurol. 2015; 14: 720-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), was similar among the groups (Figure 1J). Animals in all groups exhibited negligible uninhibited bladder contractions, a finding consistent with normal bladder activity (Figure 1K). All treatment groups had minimal residual urine at the end of the last voiding cycle, representing low bladder outlet resistance and, correspondingly, high voiding efficiency (Figures 1L and 1M). Detailed results of key cystometric outcomes are shown in Table S1. These results hold true for cell transplantation at both of the tested doses. Thus, hESC-MGE transplantation in the lumbar enlargement does not appear to adversely affect bladder function, based on our measures of bladder functionality. The fate of hESC-MGEs in the uninjured spinal cord was evaluated at 6 months post-transplantation. Human cell persistence was similar for both groups. Transplanted cells were distributed rostro-caudally up to 1 mm beyond the transplant site within the uninjured cord (Figure 2A). The cell distribution for individual animals is summarized in Figures S1D–S1M. Transplanted cells primarily differentiated toward neuronal (NEUN, NEUN+ human nuclear antigen (HNA)+/HNA+; low dose, 26% ± 4%; high dose, 30% ± 3%; n = 5 mice/dose) and oligodendroglial (OLIG2, OLIG2+ HNA+/HNA+; low dose, 36% ± 3%; high dose, 25% ± 2%; n = 3 mice/dose) lineages, with infrequent detection of proliferation markers (HNA+ KI67+ cells; low dose, 1.7% ± 0.5%; high dose, 1.3% ± 0.2%; n = 3 mice/dose). Stem123, a marker of human astrocytic processes, also was detected in the transplanted animals, and only a small fraction of cells expressed the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX) (Figures 2B–2E). Various neuronal subtype markers were used to characterize the transplanted hESC-MGEs (Figure 2E). Many HNA+ cells expressed SOX6, a marker for MGE-derived GABAergic neurons (Batista-Brito et al., 2009Batista-Brito R. Rossignol E. Hjerling-Leffler J. Denaxa M. Wegner M. Lefebvre V. Pachnis V. Fishell G. The cell-intrinsic requirement of Sox6 for cortical interneuron development.Neuron. 2009; 63: 466-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. HNA+ cells also expressed GABAergic neuron subtype markers, such as calbindin, calretinin, somatostatin, and parvalbumin. Aside from rare cells, we did not detect grafted human cells expressing markers of other neuronal lineages, including cholinergic (CHAT), dopaminergic (TH), or glutamatergic (TBR1) neurons (not shown). Together these results demonstrate that hESC-MGEs survive in the uninjured spinal cord, mainly differentiating into GABAergic neuron subtypes and glial cells by 6 months post-transplantation. Mice injured at the segmental level T13 were transplanted with hESC-MGEs (450,000 cells/mouse) in the lumbar enlargement at 2 weeks post-injury (Figures 3 and S2). At 6 months post-transplantation, cells were broadly dispersed in the injured cord, extending ∼10 mm rostro-caudal. The peak of the distribution was rostral to the transplant site, suggesting that these hESC-MGEs were attracted to the injury epicenter (Figure 4A). The cell distribution for individual animals is shown in Figure S3. We found robust human cell persistence (HNA+, 106% ± 59%; n = 13 animals; Figures 4A and S3), with substantial numbers differentiating into MGE-type GABAergic neurons (HNA+ SOX6+, 50.8% ± 3.4%; HNA+ NEUN+, 35.4% ± 2.2%) and minimal cell proliferation (HNA+ KI67+, 0.2% ± 0.1%) (Figure 4B). Some of the human cells differentiated into oligodendroglia (HNA+ OLIG2+, 8.7% ± 0.7%). Only 1.0% ± 0.3% of human cells expressed both OLIG2 and NKX2.1-GFP (Figure S4), suggesting a rare population of potential residual MGE-type progenitor cells. To determine whether pluripotent cells persist in the grafted animals, sections were stained for OCT4 and only 0.017% ± 0.01% (2/12,877 cells) of human cells expressed the pluripotency marker (Figure S4). Sections at 200-μm intervals were examined along the entire length of the cord to determine the tumorigenicity of hESC-MGEs (Lee et al., 2013aLee A.S. Tang C. Rao M.S. Weissman I.L. Wu J.C. Tumorigenicity as a clinical hurdle for pluripotent stem cell therapies.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Similar to the uninjured spinal cords, we found no indication of tumors. There was no evidence of focal accumulation of cells; singular HNA+ cells were dispersed along the axis of the spinal cord and there was very limited proliferative activity.Figure 4Transplanted hESC-MGEs Survive and Migrate in the Injured Spinal Cord, Differentiating into GABAergic NeuronsShow full caption(A–C) Presented data are collected at 6 months post-transplantation (n = 13, biological replicates).(A) Migratory pattern of hESC-MGEs in the injured spinal cord.

Scale bars, 50 μm. Arrowheads indicate double-positive cells. Additional cell marker studies are shown in Figure S4. Neuronal subtype marker expression was analyzed in the injured cord (Figure 4C), and many transplanted cells expressed GABA and markers for subpopulations of GABAergic neurons, including calbindin, calretinin, somatostatin, and parvalbumin. Similar to the uninjured cord, transplanted cells also expressed Stem123, and few cells (4.1% ± 2.5%) were DCX+ (Figure S4), suggesting the presence of more mature neuronal cells beyond the migratory stage. These results indicate that transplanted hESC-MGEs survive, migrate to the lesioned segment, and differentiate appropriately into GABAergic neuron subtypes and glial cells. We examined the electrophysiological characteristics and synaptic integration of cells at 6 months post-transplantation. Whole-cell recordings were performed on NKX2.1-GFP+ cells in fresh longitudinal spinal cord slice sections (Figures 5A and 5D ). The morphology of recorded cells was identified by intracellular filling with neurobiotin and post-immunostaining with streptavidin-549 (Figure 5E). We confirmed that recorded cells were positive for the human cell nuclear-specific marker HNA (6/6, Figures 5E and S5). We also observed that some hESC-MGE-derived neurons downregulated NKX2.1-GFP, a hallmark of cortical-type interneurons (Figure S5). The majority (32/39) of NKX2.1-GFP+ cells could fire action potentials (Figures 5B and S6) and demonstrated spontaneous synaptic activity (22/22, Figure 5D). Moreover, we found that electrical stimulation in lateral spinal cord tracts evoked synaptic currents in hESC-MGE-derived neurons (7/10 cells). The evoked synaptic currents were either glutamatergic responses (27.3 ± 4.8 pA; n = 3; Figure 5C) that were not blocked by the GABA-A receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI; 21.3 ± 4.9 pA) but were fully blocked by the non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist Quinoxalinedione (CNQX; 0.8 ± 0.3 pA) or they were GABAergic synaptic responses (43.6 ± 11.5 pA; n = 4; Figure 5C) that were not sensitive to CNQX (37.5 ± 12.8 pA) but were completely blocked by BMI (0.8 ± 0.3 pA). We also recorded cells (7/39) with glial cell membrane properties (Figure S6), consistent with the glial cell marker expression of a minority of the hESC-MGE-derived cells (Figure 4). Taken together, these results show that hESC-MGEs can differentiate into functional neurons, form synaptic connections, and functionally integrate into the injured mouse spinal cord following transplantation. Given that the hESC-MGEs could differentiate into GABAergic neurons and the importance of GABA in modulating bladder function and pain pathways, we assessed the functional ramifications of cell transplantation in the injured cord. Immediately prior to randomization and cell transplantation at 2 weeks post-injury, all mice had similar locomotor deficits—an average BMS score of 3, which is indicative of plantar placing with or without weight support. There were no differences in locomotor recovery between vehicle and hESC-MGE-treated groups over 6 months post-treatment (Figure 6A). The dosage used produced no obvious adverse side effects, such as weight loss and/or failure to thrive (Figure 6B). SCI may result in chronic allodynia and hyperalgesia (Detloff et al., 2013Detloff M.R. Wade Jr., R.E. Houlé J.D. Chronic at- and below-level pain after moderate unilateral cervical spinal cord contusion in rats.J. Neurotrauma. 2013; 30: 884-890Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), characteristics of CNP. Spinal cord-injured mice developed tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia at 2 weeks post-injury (Figures 6C and 6F) that was sustained over an observation period of 6 months (Figures S7A and S7D). Cell transplantation alleviated tactile allodynia at both 3 and 6 months post-transplantation (Figures 6D and 6E), and it alleviated hyperalgesia at 6 months post-transplantation (Figures 6G and 6H). To determine if the number of surviving cells affected pain outcomes, we performed correlation analyses. Transplanted cells, expressing markers of mature neurons or interneurons at 6 months, were only weakly correlated to these measures of CNP (Figure S7). Unplanned post hoc analyses comparing numbers of surviving cells to measures of CNP did not show significant differences, although there was a trend toward reduced allodynia with >200,000 surviving mature neurons (Figure S7G). Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice show varying degrees of abnormal grooming and scratching behavior, likely due to breeding on a C57BL/6 background, which is naturally prone to such behavior (George et al., 2015George N.M. Whitaker J. Vieira G. Geronimo J.T. Bellinger D.A. Fletcher C.A. Garner J.P. Antioxidant therapies for ulcerative dermatitis: a potential model for skin picking disorder.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0132092Google Scholar). To determine whether hESC-MGE transplantation alleviates this abnormal behavior, all mice were assessed for fur loss at or below the area corresponding to the level of cell transplantation. At 6 months post-transplantation, cell-transplanted mice showed a fur loss area of 17% (Figure 6I), while vehicle-treated or naive mice showed a fur loss area of 45% and 50%, respectively (Figures 6J and 6K). Taken together, these data demonstrate that hESC-MGE transplantation mitigates CNP and abnormal over-grooming behavior. The emergence of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is in part related to the loss of GABAergic function in the injured spinal cord (de Groat et al., 2015de Groat W.C. Griffiths D. Yoshimura N. Neural control of the lower urinary tract.Compr. Physiol. 2015; 5: 327-396PubMed Google Scholar, Hou and Rabchevsky, 2014Hou S. Rabchevsky A.G. Autonomic consequences of spinal cord injury.Compr. Physiol. 2014; 4: 1419-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To determine if hESC-MGE transplantation reduces bladder dysfunction at 6 months post-transplantation, urologic function was evaluated by two complimentary measures: the spontaneous voiding test (Gevaert et al., 2007Gevaert T. Vriens J. Segal A. Everaerts W. Roskams T. Talavera K. Owsianik G. Liedtke W. Daelemans D. Dewachter I. et al.Deletion of the transient receptor potential cation channel TRPV4 impairs murine bladder voiding.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 3453-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and conscious cystometry (Girard et al., 2012Girard B.M. Tompkins J.D. Parsons R.L. May V. Vizzard M.A. Effects of CYP-induced cystitis on PACAP/VIP and receptor expression in micturition pathways and bladder function in mice with overexpression of NGF in urothelium.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2012; 48: 730-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The spontaneous voiding test revealed remarkable differences in voiding behavior among the groups. Uninjured naive mice exhibited a distinct voiding pattern characterized by large urine spots (≥3 cm in diameter) that were preferentially located within one or more corners of the cage. Spinal cord-injured, vehicle-treated animals voided smaller volumes (most of them <3 cm in diameter) randomly spread throughout the cage due to loss of coordinated voiding. In contrast, hESC-MGE-transplanted mice showed a broader range in the diameters of urine spots and a tendency toward voiding in the corners of the cage (Figures 7A–7E). The hESC-MGE-treated mice regained partial bladder control, as evidenced by the percentage of animals that were able to void and generate urine spots ≥3 cm in diameter consistently across 2 days of testing (Figures 7F and 7G). Transplanted cells, showing markers of mature neurons or interneurons at 6 months, were only weakly correlated to the number of urine spots ≥3 cm (Figures S7I and S7L). Representative cystometry recordings from each treatment group are shown in Figures 7H–7J. As might be expected (Lang et al., 2015Lang B.T. Cregg J.M. DePaul M.A. Tran A.P. Xu K. Dyck S.M. Madalena K.M. Brown B.P. Weng Y.L. Li S. et al.Modulation of the proteoglycan receptor PTPσ promotes recovery after spinal cord injury.Nature. 2015; 518: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), SCI resulted in dramatic changes in key cystometry measures as compared to naive controls (Table S2). Next we asked whether hESC-MGE transplantation would improve bladder function compared to vehicle controls. The findings are summarized in Table S2. There was a decrease in maximal voiding pressure, in the number of non-voiding contractions, and in residual urine in the hESC-MGE group (Figures 7K–7M). Correspondingly, voiding efficiency was improved and there was less bladder over-distension (Figures 7N and 7O). Improvements in bladder function in transplanted animals were associated with a reduction in aberrant remodeling of the bladder wall, including hypertrophy of its detrusor muscle layer, relative to vehicle controls (Figures 7P–7U). Together these data demonstrate that hESC-MGE-transplanted animals show reduced bladder outlet resistance and detrusor overactivity, which correspond to improved voiding function. We demonstrate disease-modifying capabilities of hESC-MGEs in a pre-clinical model of SCI. The hESC-MGEs survive, migrate, differentiate into GABAergic neuron subtypes, functionally integrate into local circuitry, reduce CNP, and ameliorate bladder dysfunction after SCI. Circuitry within the CNS is highly dependent upon a finely tuned balance between excitatory glutamatergic input and modulatory GABAergic inhibition (Higley, 2014Higley M.J. Localized GABAergic inhibition of dendritic Ca(2+) signalling.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011Isaacson J.S. Scanziani M. How inhibition shapes cortical activity.Neuron. 2011; 72: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons represent a novel resource to treat multiple intractable neurological disorders that are symptomatic of interneuron dysregulation and imbalances in neural activity, including epilepsy, peripheral nerve injury-induced pain, Parkinson’s disease, and psychiatric disorders (Southwell et al., 2014Southwell D.G.

However, prior work was based on primary mouse MGE cell transplantation. Recognizing the need to develop more clinically relevant human cell lines, this study used MGE-like precursors, derived from hESCs (Nicholas et al., 2013Nicholas C.R. Chen J. Tang Y. Southwell D.G.

To address how experience affects the balance between the robustness and efficiency of sensory codes, we probed odor representations in the mouse olfactory bulb during learning over a week, using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging. When mice learned to discriminate between two dissimilar odorants, responses of mitral cell ensembles to the two odorants gradually became less discrete, increasing the efficiency. In contrast, when mice learned to discriminate between two very similar odorants, the initially overlapping representations of the two odorants became progressively decorrelated, enhancing the robustness. Qualitatively similar changes were observed when the same odorants were experienced passively, a condition that would induce implicit perceptual learning. These results suggest that experience adjusts odor representations to balance the robustness and efficiency depending on the similarity of the experienced odorants.

These results suggest that experience adjusts odor representations to balance the robustness and efficiency depending on the similarity of the experienced odorants. The stimulus space in the environment is infinitely large and continuous. Sensory systems need to effectively represent these stimuli according to perceptual categories, which are often defined through learning. For example, it has been shown that parents of identical twins learn to use subtle visual cues to discriminate between their own twin children, but the effect of this learning is highly specific and does not generalize to other twins (Saether and Laeng, 2008Saether L. Laeng B. On facial expertise: processing strategies of twins’ parents.Perception. 2008; 37: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We consider the effect of learning on two factors related to the effectiveness of sensory representations. First, the representations need to be robust, maintaining a consistent identification of the same stimuli across multiple trials, which can be achieved by encoding redundant information across many channels. Second, representations should be efficient, allowing the encoding of a large number of distinct stimulus categories within the constraint of a finite capacity of sensory systems. We note that efficiency in this sense is not directly related to metabolic costs but instead is a measure of how many distinct stimuli a system can encode. In a system with stable signal-to-noise ratio within individual channels, as well as biological levels of interneuronal correlations, robustness and efficiency are opposing factors that are at odds with each other. For example, if each stimulus is represented by a completely distinct ensemble of neurons, it would be very robust but inefficient, limiting coding capacity (Figure 1A, top). In contrast, if representations of different stimuli are highly overlapping, it would be efficient but sensitive to noise (Figure 1A, bottom). Here we address how these two factors are adjusted during learning in the olfactory system of mice. Olfactory transduction begins when an odorant binds to odorant receptors on olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), whose cell bodies lie in the nasal epithelium. Each OSN expresses only one of ∼1,000 odorant receptors (Buck and Axel, 1991Buck L. Axel R. A novel multigene family may encode odorant receptors: a molecular basis for odor recognition.Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3691) Google Scholar), and all OSNs expressing a given receptor converge their axons onto one or two glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (Mombaerts et al., 1996Mombaerts P. Wang F. Dulac C. Chao S.K. Nemes A. Mendelsohn M. Edmondson J. Axel R. Visualizing an olfactory sensory map.Cell. 1996; 87: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Here the OSN axons synapse onto the dendrites of mitral/tufted cells, the principal neurons of the bulb, each of which projects their dendrites to a single glomerulus and in turn sends out axons to higher areas of the brain. Thus, olfactory information entering higher brain areas from the olfactory bulb is encoded within the activity of mitral/tufted cell ensembles. The olfactory bulb does not function as a passive relay station from the nose to higher brain areas. Instead, it processes olfactory information owing to the functions of the large population of local interneurons (Arevian et al., 2008Arevian A.C. Kapoor V. Urban N.N.

Additionally, feedback from the olfactory cortex and neuromodulatory areas modulates mitral cell odorant responses and is important for olfactory tasks such as odor discrimination and detection (Boyd et al., 2012Boyd A.M.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how different types of experience affect odor representations in the early stages of processing is still lacking. Here we attempt a systematic examination of changes in mitral cell odor representations during four types of week-long odor experience: active learning, where mice perform either an “easy” or “difficult” discrimination task between dissimilar or similar odorant pairs, and passive experience, where mice are passively and repeatedly exposed to the same disimilar or similar pair of odorants as in the behavioral tasks. By using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging, we monitored the responses of the same populations of mitral cells over a week. Our results indicate that the difficulty level of discrimination has a profound impact on the changes of mitral cell odor representations. In all conditions, Pcdh21-Cre mice were injected in the right olfactory bulb with Cre-dependent AAV to express GCaMP6f specifically in mitral/tufted cells (Figure 1B). In the discrimination task (Komiyama et al., 2010Komiyama T. Sato T.R. O’Connor D.H. Zhang Y.-X. Huber D. Hooks B.M. Gabitto M. Svoboda K. Learning-related fine-scale specificity imaged in motor cortex circuits of behaving mice.Nature. 2010; 464: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), one of two odorants was presented in each trial for 4 s, followed by the answer period during which mice were supposed to lick in response to one of the odorants for a water reward and withhold from licking to the other odorant. Mice were trained daily, one session per day, and performed 138.6 ± 1.9 (mean ± SEM) trials per session. Mice first underwent pre-training, which familiarized them with the task with odorant pairs that were different from those used for the imaging experiments (Figures 1C and 1D). After pre-training, mice performed the discrimination task with a novel pair of odorants over 7 days while we imaged the responses of mitral cell ensembles (67 ± 5.4 mitral cells per mouse, mean ± SEM). The same population of mitral cells was imaged in each session (Figures 1E and 1F) (Kato et al., 2012Kato H.K. Chu M.W. Isaacson J.S. Komiyama T. Dynamic sensory representations in the olfactory bulb: modulation by wakefulness and experience.Neuron. 2012; 76: 962-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We first asked whether and how mitral cell odor representations were altered during a week of discrimination training with a pair of distinct monomolecular odorants (Heptanal, S+ or “odorant 1” and Ethyl Tiglate, S− or “odorant 2”; n = 8 mice). In this easy discrimination task, mice mastered the task within the first tens of trials in the first session and maintained a high success rate on subsequent sessions (Figure 2A). Each odorant elicited responses from a large fraction of mitral cells on the first day of training. On average, 41.6% ± 7.5% of the imaged mitral cell population exhibited significant changes in fluorescence to at least one odorant during the odor period.

Additionally, a large fraction of the responsive mitral cells exhibited divergent responses between the two odorants on day 1 (Figures 2B–2D and S1). During the week-long training paradigm, we observed notable changes in the odorant responses of individual mitral cells. First, there was a gradual decrease in the fraction of responsive mitral cells, from 41.6% ± 7.5% responsive on day 1 to 16.6% ± 4.9% on day 7 (Figure 2D). Both of the two odorants showed a similar level of sparsening during training (Figure S2). Second, the fraction of cells whose responses significantly discriminate the two odorants (“divergent cells”) also decreased (from 33.1% ± 6.0% on day 1 to 11.8% ± 3.0% on day 7) (Figure 2D). As a result, the proportion of divergent mitral cells out of the responsive population on each day was maintained (Figure 2E). Next we quantified the discriminability of individual divergent cells using the sensitivity index d′. The average sensitivity index of mitral cells classified as divergent on each day decreased slightly with learning (Figure 2F). Thus, during the learning of the easy discrimination task, information about odorant identity became encoded in fewer mitral cells and less robustly in individual cells. Given these changes in mitral cell odorant responses, we next asked whether the quality of encoding of odorant identity by mitral cell populations changed during learning. To this end, we performed a decoder analysis to test how well the representations of the two odorants were separated. Briefly, the population response in each trial was expressed as a high dimensional vector, and we asked whether the vector of a given trial was closer to the centroid of the trials (excluding the trial of interest) of the same odorant (correct classification) or of the other odorant (incorrect classification). We repeated this procedure for every trial and calculated the frequency of correct classification on each day (Experimental Procedures). On the first day, decoder performance was nearly perfect, with an average of 95.4% ± 1.1% correct classifications, reflecting the discrete representations of the two dissimilar odorants (Figure 2G). The decoder performance significantly decreased on subsequent training days, with a mean of 83.6% ± 3.1% correct classifications on day 7. Other methods of decoding, namely linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM), yielded similar results (Figure S3). In contrast, we found that the correlation coefficient, a commonly used measure for the similarity of ensemble activity, was sensitive to the sparsening in our dataset and proved not to be a reliable measure of activity separability (Figure S4). Thus, below we focused on decoder analysis. We note that the imperfect decoder performance after training, which is below the behavioral performance of the mice (Figure 2A), is likely due to the limited number of mitral cells used for the decoder, as mice have access to a much larger population of mitral cells to accurately identify the odorants. Finally, to assess whether the decoder performance relies on a small number of highly divergent mitral cells or uses information distributed across many mitral cells, we calculated how the decoder accuracy degrades as we reduce the number of mitral cells (Experimental Procedures). The decoder accuracy gradually deteriorated as we removed the most informative mitral cell at each permutation, suggesting that the information about odorant identity is highly distributed. This trend was generally maintained throughout training (Figure 2H). In summary, the easy discrimination task resulted in a gradually smaller separability of the representations of the two dissimilar odorants. We reasoned that this counterintuitive change may be due to the fact that the two odorants were very different. In this case, the discrimination is very easy and thus not the limiting factor of behavioral performance, which may allow the system to reduce the robustness of odor representations and prioritize the efficiency. If so, the difficulty level of discrimination may be an important factor determining the directionality of changes, a notion that we tested in the following section. In the difficult discrimination task, a separate cohort of mice (n = 10) were imaged while they were trained with a pair of binary odorant mixtures after the pre-training phase. Odorants were mixed at very similar ratios (odorant 1, 52% heptanal/48% ethyl tiglate; odorant 2, 48% heptanal/52% ethyl tiglate) to ensure the difficulty of discrimination. These ratios were chosen based on results from pilot experiments which tested several ratios in a separate set of mice (data not shown). In contrast to the easy discrimination task, which all mice mastered within the first day, mice demonstrated a slower learning of the difficult discrimination task, suggesting that the similar odorant mixtures were more challenging to discriminate. On the first day, mice had a mean success rate of 53.3% ± 1.0%, indicating that mice were initially unable to distinguish between the odorant mixtures. The performance gradually improved on subsequent days and mice required on average 4 days to perform above an 80% success rate (Figure 3A). During this week-long training, we observed notable changes in individual mitral cell responses. First, as observed during easy discrimination, there was a sparsening of mitral cell responses, with a decrease from 37.8% ± 4.2% responsive on day 1 to 17.6% ± 3.8% responsive on day 7. However, the fraction of mitral cells with divergent responses remained stable (Figures 3B–3D). As a result, the fraction of divergent mitral cells among those that are responsive increased with learning (Figure 3E). Furthermore, the average discriminability of individual divergent cells increased with learning, indicating that, despite the stable fraction of divergent cells out of all imaged cells, individual divergent cells became more robust in encoding the odorant identity (Figure 3F). Using the same classification method described earlier, we asked whether there was a change in how well the activity of mitral cell ensembles distinguished odorant identity during the difficult discrimination training. The decoder performance on day 1 was significantly lower than that on day 1 of easy discrimination (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), consistent with the difference in the similarity of odorant pairs. In contrast to the degradation of the decoder performance observed during easy discrimination training, the performance of the decoder improved significantly during difficult discrimination training from 0.69 ± 0.03 on day 1 to 0.79 ± 0.02 on day 7, despite the decrease in the number of mitral cells responding to these odorants (Figure 3G). Similarly to the easy discrimination training, the decoder relied on distributed information from large populations of mitral cells (Figure 3H). It has been proposed that changes in the trial-to-trial correlation structure, specifically an alteration in the relationship between noise correlation and signal correlation, can affect the discriminability of ensemble activity during perceptual learning (Cohen and Maunsell, 2009Cohen M.R. Maunsell J.H. Attention improves performance primarily by reducing interneuronal correlations.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, Jeanne et al., 2013Jeanne J.M. Sharpee T.O. Gentner T.Q. Associative learning enhances population coding by inverting interneuronal correlation patterns.Neuron. 2013; 78: 352-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, we found no evidence of such a change mediating the observed improvement in decoder performance. When we shuffled the trials of individual mitral cells within each odorant’s trials to eliminate response covariance across cells (noise correlation), the decoder performance consistently improved, indicating that noise correlation is mildly detrimental to the decoder performance (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). This effect did not change with training (Figure 3I). Furthermore, trial-to-trial variability of population responses, another potential contributor to the decoder performance, did not change with training (Figure 3J). Instead, the distance between trial-averaged responses of the two odorants within the population activity space increased gradually (Figure 3K). This is reminiscent of a recent study that found that distance (or “signal”), but not noise, increased in the primary visual cortex during visual perceptual learning (Yan et al., 2014Yan Y. Rasch M.J. Chen M. Xiang X. Huang M. Wu S. Li W. Perceptual training continuously refines neuronal population codes in primary visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that the distance between odorant responses is the main determinant of decoder accuracy, these two measures exhibited very tight correlation on individual days (Figure 3L). The distance, not the variability or correlation structures, was also the main determinant of decoder accuracy in the easy discrimination task (Figures S3 and S5). Taken together, training with the difficult discrimination task results in an increased separation of the representations of the two similar odorants that are initially overlapping. During the difficult discrimination task, behavioral performance plateaued at ∼85% success rate after 4 days. The errors were almost exclusively (97.4%, 530 of 544 error trials on days 4–7) false alarms in which mice licked during no-lick trials. We asked whether these error trials could be predicted by mitral cell odorant responses. To address this question, we projected the population responses of individual trials onto the axis connecting the mean responses of odorant 1 and odorant 2 trials (“discrimination axis”). Strikingly, the distributions of false alarm trials and that of correct rejection trials (correct no-lick in no-lick trials) were significantly different (p < 0.001, bootstrap), with the false alarm distribution lying in between the mean responses of odorant 1 and odorant 2 trials (Figure 3M). Accordingly, within odorant 2 trials, there was a monotonic relationship between the location of the population response on a given trial along the discrimination axis and the probability of false alarms, with more “odorant 1-like responses” corresponding to a higher frequency of false alarms (r = −0.69, p < 0.001, Spearman correlation, Figure 3N). These results suggest that, when mitral cells respond to odorant 2 in an “odorant 1-like” manner, mice are more likely to perceive it as odorant 1. The results so far suggest that mitral cell odor representations undergo distinct changes in the easy and difficult discrimination tasks. In order to visualize the changes in the high-dimensional mitral cell population responses, we next performed principal component analysis. This allowed us to project odorant responses either for individual mice or for pooled responses across all mice in a space with reduced dimensions. Consistent with the observations with the decoder analysis, in the easy discrimination task, the representations of the two odorants were highly discrete and non-overlapping on day 1. After the training, the representations became closer in the activity space, although they were still relatively distinct (Figures 4A and 4B ). In contrast, in the difficult discrimination task, mitral cell odor representations were initially highly overlapping on day 1, reflecting the high similarity of the two odorants. With difficult discrimination training, however, the representations of the two odorants became more separable and discrete by day 7 (Figures 4C and 4D). It has been argued that passive exposure to similar odorants can enhance spontaneous discrimination (Escanilla et al., 2008Escanilla O. Mandairon N. Linster C.

https://openalex.org/W2521766521,"Protein phosphorylation is an essential step for the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting, activity-dependent strengthening of synaptic transmission widely regarded as a cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory. At the core of LTP is the synaptic insertion of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) triggered by the NMDA receptor-dependent activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). However, the CaMKII substrate that increases AMPAR-mediated transmission during LTP remains elusive. Here, we identify the hippocampus-enriched TARPγ-8, but not TARPγ-2/3/4, as a critical CaMKII substrate for LTP. We found that LTP induction increases TARPγ-8 phosphorylation, and that CaMKII-dependent enhancement of AMPAR-mediated transmission requires CaMKII phosphorylation sites of TARPγ-8. Moreover, LTP and memory formation, but not basal transmission, are significantly impaired in mice lacking CaMKII phosphorylation sites of TARPγ-8. Together, these findings demonstrate that TARPγ-8 is a crucial mediator of CaMKII-dependent LTP and therefore a molecular target that controls synaptic plasticity and associated cognitive functions."

Applying fine-mapping analysis to 233 known and new loci associated with the 20 traits, we resolve the associations of 59 loci to credible sets of 20 or fewer variants and describe trait enrichments within regions of predicted regulatory function.

In Tshz3-null mice, differentially expressed genes include layer-specific markers of cerebral cortical projection neurons (CPNs), and the human orthologs of these genes are strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, mice heterozygous for Tshz3 show functional changes at synapses established by CPNs and exhibit core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities.

https://openalex.org/W2522686241,"Azobenzene photoswitches confer light sensitivity onto retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in blind mice, making these compounds promising candidates as vision-restoring drugs in humans with degenerative blindness. Remarkably, photosensitization manifests only in animals with photoreceptor degeneration and is absent from those with intact rods and cones. Here we show that P2X receptors mediate the entry of photoswitches into RGCs, where they associate with voltage-gated ion channels, enabling light to control action-potential firing. All charged photoswitch compounds require permeation through P2X receptors, whose gene expression is upregulated in the blind retina. Photoswitches and membrane-impermeant fluorescent dyes likewise penetrate through P2X receptors to label a subset of RGCs in the degenerated retina. Electrophysiological recordings and mapping of fluorescently labeled RGC dendritic projections together indicate that photosensitization is highly selective for OFF-RGCs. Hence, P2X receptors are a natural conduit allowing cell-type-selective and degeneration-specific delivery of photoswitches to restore visual function in blinding disease."

Several chemical inhibitors of ribosome function are available and used as tools or drugs.

Here, we combine chemical and genetic approaches to discover ribozinoindoles (or Rbins), potent and reversible triazinoindole-based inhibitors of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis. Analyses of Rbin sensitivity and resistance conferring mutations in fission yeast, along with biochemical assays with recombinant proteins, provide evidence that Rbins’ physiological target is Midasin, an essential ∼540-kDa AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) protein. Using Rbins to acutely inhibit or activate Midasin function, in parallel experiments with inhibitor-sensitive or inhibitor-resistant cells, we uncover Midasin’s role in assembling Nsa1 particles, nucleolar precursors of the 60S subunit. Together, our findings demonstrate that Rbins are powerful probes for eukaryotic ribosome assembly."

Our recent studies suggest that Plk1 is indispensable for smooth muscle cell proliferation. Plk1 regulates smooth muscle cell proliferation by controlling the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in response to activation of growth factors (19.Tang D.D.

Res. 2015; 16: 93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The role of Plk1 in smooth muscle contraction has not been previously investigated. Structural analysis reveals that Plk1 is composed of a common N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain with highly conserved sequences named polo-box domain (PBD) and an interdomain linker (18.Barr F.A.

PBD is observed only in Plk and is involved in an autoregulatory mechanism and binding to substrates (17.Petronczki M. Lénárt P. Peters J.M.

Structural basis for the inhibition of Polo-like kinase 1.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In vitro biochemical studies suggest that the activation of Plk1 can be regulated by phosphorylation at Thr-210 (18.Barr F.A. Silljé H.H. Nigg E.A.

When inactive, PBD binds to the catalytic domain, which inhibits the access of substrates to the catalytic domain. Plk1 phosphorylation at Thr-210 may induce the dissociation of PBD from the catalytic domain, increasing kinase activity (17.Petronczki M. Lénárt P. Peters J.M.

Plk1 undergoes phosphorylation at Thr-210 during mitosis and cytokinesis, which may regulate its function in the processes (17.Petronczki M. Lénárt P. Peters J.M.

The interaction of SLK with Plk1 in human cells is largely unknown. In this study we find that Plk1 is indispensable for smooth muscle contraction. Plk1 regulates smooth muscle contraction by controlling vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56. Furthermore, contractile stimulation induces Plk1 phosphorylation at Thr-210 and activation in smooth muscle. SLK is an upstream regulator of Plk1 in smooth muscle. In vitro biochemical studies suggest that Plk1 is activated by phosphorylation at Thr-210 (18.Barr F.A. Silljé H.H. Nigg E.A. Polo-like kinases and the orchestration of cell division.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 21.Xu J. Shen C. Wang T. Quan J. Structural basis for the inhibition of Polo-like kinase 1.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We used immunoblot analysis to determine whether contractile stimulation induces Plk1 phosphorylation at this residue. In unstimulated smooth muscle cells, phosphorylation of Plk1 at Thr-210 was low. Stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh) increased the phosphorylation level of Plk1 at Thr-210 in smooth muscle (Fig. 1A). To monitor Plk1 activation in live cells, we constructed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Plk1 biosensor. We fused DsRed to the N terminus and GFP to the C terminus of Plk1 (Fig. 1B). We then evaluated the effects of contractile stimulation on Plk1 activation in live cells. Human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells expressing the Plk1 sensor were treated with ACh, and emissions of DsRed and GFP were monitored live using a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Before stimulation, the emission ratios of GFP/DsRed were relatively lower. In response to ACh stimulation, the GFP signal was increased, whereas the DsRed signal was decreased (Fig. 1C). The GFP/DsRed ratios gradually increased during the course of contractile activation (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that contractile stimulation activates Plk1 in live smooth muscle cells. To assess whether Thr-210 phosphorylation affects Plk1 activation in cells, we generated a T210A Plk1 biosensor (alanine substitution at Thr-210) and evaluated the effects of ACh stimulation on the activation of mutant Plk1. The emission ratios of GFP/dsRed for the T210A Plk1 biosensor were not increased in response to ACh stimulation (Fig. 1, C and D). The results indicate that Thr-210 phosphorylation regulates Plk1 activation in smooth muscle cells. To further characterize the biosensor, cells expressing single-probe constructs (GFP-tagged construct or DsRed-tagged construct) were treated with ACh, and emission of GFP and DsRed was evaluated using the confocal microscope under the same experimental condition. For cells expressing the GFP construct, GFP emission was high, whereas DsRed emission was undetected. In cells expressing the DsRed construct, neither GFP nor DsRed emission was detected (Fig. 1, E and F). The results validate the selectivity and sensitivity of the biosensor. As described earlier, Plk1 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that has a role in cytokinesis (17.Petronczki M. Lénárt P. Peters J.M.

Bronchial rings were then transduced with lentiviruses encoding control shRNA or Plk1 shRNA. These tissues were incubated in the serum-free medium for 3 days. Contractile force of these tissues was then evaluated. Immunoblot analysis verified the lower expression of Plk1 in tissues transduced with viruses encoding Plk1 shRNA compared with uninfected rings and tissues transduced with viruses for control shRNA (Fig. 2A). More importantly, contractile responses of human bronchial rings were lower in Plk1-deficient tissues than in control tissues (Fig. 2B). To further evaluate the role of Plk1 in smooth muscle, we also generated smooth muscle conditional Plk1 knock-out mice. Contractile responses of mouse tracheal rings to ACh stimulation were compared between Plk1smko (smooth muscle knock-out of Plk1) mice and Plk1−lox (control) mice. As shown in Fig. 2C, contractile responses of mouse tracheal rings to ACh were lower in Plk1smko mice than in Plk1−lox mice, which was dose-dependent. We also evaluated acute effects of the Plk1 pharmacological inhibitors BI6727 (29.Rudolph D. Steegmaier M. Hoffmann M. Grauert M. Baum A. Quant J. Haslinger C. Garin-Chesa P. Adolf G.R.

To determine whether Plk1 mediates vimentin phosphorylation, we evaluated the effects of Plk1 knockdown on vimentin phosphorylation in smooth muscle cells. In cells treated with control shRNA, acetylcholine stimulation induced vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56. In contrast, the ACh-induced vimentin phosphorylation was reduced in smooth muscle treated with Plk1 shRNA (Fig. 3A). However, ACh-induced vimentin phosphorylation in Plk1 knockdown cells was higher compared with unstimulated Plk1 knockdown cells (Fig. 3A). The results suggest that Plk1 partially regulates vimentin phosphorylation at this residue in smooth muscle. We also used the in vitro kinase assay to assess whether Plk1 directly mediates vimentin phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser-56 was increased in the presence of Plk1. However, Plk1 did not enhance phosphorylation of S56A mutant vimentin (alanine substitution at Ser-56) (Fig. 3B) (9.Li Q.F. Spinelli A.M. Wang R. Anfinogenova Y. Singer H.A. Tang D.D.

The tissues were cultured in the serum-free medium for 2 days to allow for protein expression. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the expression of the recombinant proteins (Fig. 4A). It was noticed that endogenous Plk1 was reduced in tissues expressing wild type (WT) or T210A Plk1. This could be because exogenous Plk1 mRNA competes with endogenous Plk1 mRNA for the same translational machine (9.Li Q.F. Spinelli A.M. Wang R. Anfinogenova Y. Singer H.A. Tang D.D.

Contractile force was reduced in tissues expressing mutant T210A Plk1compared with tissues transfected with WT Plk1 (Fig. 4B). We then determined the effects of mutant T210A Plk1 on vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56 and myosin light chain phosphorylation. The ACh-induced vimentin phosphorylation was reduced in smooth muscle cells expressing Plk1T210A (Fig. 4C). In addition, ACh-induced vimentin phosphorylation in cells expressing T210A Plk1 was higher compared with basal vimentin Ser-56 phosphorylation in cells expressing T210A Plk1 (Fig. 4C).

Since 2011, a step-up approach with lower morbidity rates compared to initial open necrosectomy has been established. However, mortality and complication rates of this complex treatment are hardly studied thereafter. Methods The German Pancreatitis Study Group performed a multicenter, retrospective study including 220 patients with necrotising pancreatitis requiring intervention, treated at 10 hospitals in Germany between January 2008 and June 2014. Data were analysed for the primary endpoints ""severe complications"" and ""mortality"" as well as secondary endpoints including ""length of hospital stay"", ""follow up"", and predisposing or prognostic factors. Results Of all patients 13.6% were treated primarily with surgery and 86.4% underwent a step-up approach. More men (71.8%) required intervention for necrotising pancreatitis. The most frequent etiology was biliary (41.4%) followed by alcohol (29.1%). Compared to open necrosectomy, the step-up approach was associated with a lower number of severe complications (primary composite endpoint including sepsis, persistent multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and erosion bleeding: 44.7% vs. 73.3%), lower mortality (10.5% vs. 33.3%) and lower rates of diabetes mellitus type 3c (4.7% vs. 33.3%). Low hematocrit and low blood urea nitrogen at admission as well as a history of acute pancreatitis were prognostic for less complications in necrotising pancreatitis. A combination of drainage with endoscopic necrosectomy resulted in the lowest rate of severe complications. Conclusion A step-up approach starting with minimal invasive drainage techniques and endoscopic necrosectomy results in a significant reduction of morbidity and mortality in necrotising pancreatitis compared to a primarily surgical intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2525001916,"Babesia bovis, an intra-erythrocytic tick-borne apicomplexan protozoan, is one of the causative agents of bovine babesiosis. Its life cycle includes sexual reproduction within cattle fever ticks, Rhipicephalus spp. Six B. bovis 6-Cys gene superfamily members were previously identified (A, B, C, D, E, F) where their orthologues in Plasmodium parasite have been shown to encode for proteins required for the development of sexual stages. The current study identified four additional 6-Cys genes (G, H, I, J) in the B. bovis genome. These four genes are described in the context of the complete ten 6-Cys gene superfamily. The proteins expressed by this gene family are predicted to be secreted or surface membrane directed. Genetic analysis comparing the 6-Cys superfamily among five distinct B. bovis strains shows limited sequence variation. Additionally, A, B, E, H, I and J genes were transcribed in B. bovis infected tick midgut while genes A, B and E were also transcribed in the subsequent B. bovis kinete stage. Transcription of gene C was found exclusively in the kinete. In contrast, transcription of genes D, F and G in either B. bovis infected midguts or kinetes was not detected. None of the 6-Cys transcripts were detected in B. bovis blood stages. Subsequent protein analysis of 6-Cys A and B is concordant with their transcript profile. The collective data indicate as in Plasmodium parasite, certain B. bovis 6-Cys family members are uniquely expressed during sexual stages and therefore, they are likely required for parasite reproduction. Within B. bovis specifically, proteins encoded by 6-Cys genes A and B are markers for sexual stages and candidate antigens for developing novel vaccines able to interfere with the development of B. bovis within the tick vector."
https://openalex.org/W2524191147,"Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) Hdac1 and Hdac2 can associate together in protein complexes with transcriptional factors such as methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Given their high degree of sequence identity, we examined whether Hdac1 and Hdac2 were functionally redundant in mature mouse brain. We demonstrate that postnatal forebrain-specific deletion of both Hdac1 and Hdac2 in mice impacts neuronal survival and results in an excessive grooming phenotype caused by dysregulation of Sap90/Psd95-associated protein 3 (Sapap3; also known as Dlgap3) in striatum. Moreover, Hdac1- and Hdac2-dependent regulation of Sapap3 expression requires MECP2, the gene involved in the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome. We show that postnatal forebrain-specific deletion of Mecp2 causes excessive grooming, which is rescued by restoring striatal Sapap3 expression. Our results provide new insight into the upstream regulation of Sapap3 and establish the essential role of striatal Hdac1, Hdac2 and MeCP2 for suppression of repetitive behaviors."

Here, we have developed a quantitative behavioral method to assess the locomotor response following electric shock in C. elegans. Electric shock impairs normal locomotion, and induces paralysis and muscle twitching; after a brief recovery period, shocked animals resume normal locomotion. We tested electric shock responses in loss-of-function mutants for unc-25, which encodes the GABA biosynthetic enzyme GAD, and unc-49, which encodes the GABAA receptor. unc-25 and unc-49 mutants have decreased inhibitory GABAergic transmission to muscles, and take significantly more time to recover normal locomotion following electric shock compared to wild-type. Importantly, increased sensitivity of unc-25 and unc-49 mutants to electric shock is rescued by treatment with antiepileptic drugs, such as retigabine. Additionally, we show that pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a GABAA receptor antagonist and proconvulsant in mammalian and C. elegans seizure models, increases susceptibility of worms to electric shock."
https://openalex.org/W2523752832,"High fat diet reduces the expression of CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1), a transmembrane glycoprotein that promotes insulin clearance and down-regulates fatty acid synthase activity in the liver upon its phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. Because peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) transcriptionally suppresses CEACAM1 expression, we herein examined whether high fat down-regulates CEACAM1 expression in a PPARα-dependent mechanism. By activating PPARα, the lipid-lowering drug fenofibrate reverses dyslipidemia and improves insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes in part by promoting fatty acid oxidation. Despite reducing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, fenofibrate treatment does not result in insulin insufficiency. To examine whether this is mediated by a parallel decrease in CEACAM1-dependent hepatic insulin clearance pathways, we fed wild-type and Pparα−/− null mice a high fat diet supplemented with either fenofibrate or Wy14643, a selective PPARα agonist, and examined their effect on insulin metabolism and action. We demonstrated that the decrease in insulin secretion by fenofibrate and Wy14643 is accompanied by reduction in insulin clearance in wild-type but not Pparα−/− mice, thereby maintaining normoinsulinemia and insulin sensitivity despite continuous high fat intake. Intact insulin secretion in L-CC1 mice with protected hepatic insulin clearance and CEACAM1 levels provides in vivo evidence that insulin secretion responds to changes in insulin clearance to maintain physiologic insulin and glucose homeostasis. These results also emphasize the relevant role of hepatic insulin extraction in regulating insulin sensitivity.

https://openalex.org/W2526819481,"Reducing our reliance on pesticides is an essential step towards the sustainability of agricultural production. One approach involves the rational use of pesticides combined with innovative crop management. Most control strategies currently focus on the temporal aspect of epidemics, e.g. determining the optimal date for spraying, regardless of the spatial mechanics and ecology of disease spread. Designing innovative pest management strategies incorporating the spatial aspect of epidemics involves thorough knowledge on how disease control affects the life-history traits of the pathogen. In this study, using Rhizoctonia solani/Raphanus sativus as an example of a soil-borne pathosystem, we investigated the effects of a chemical control currently used by growers, Monceren® L, on key epidemiological components (saprotrophic spread and infectivity). We tested the potential ""shield effect"" of Monceren® L on pathogenic spread in a site-specific application context, i.e. the efficiency of this chemical to contain the spread of the fungus from an infected host when application is spatially localized, in our case, a strip placed between the infected host and a recipient bait. Our results showed that Monceren® L mainly inhibits the saprotrophic spread of the fungus in soil and may prevent the fungus from reaching its host plant. However, perhaps surprisingly we did not detect any significant effect of the fungicide on the pathogen infectivity. Finally, highly localized application of the fungicide-a narrow strip of soil (12.5 mm wide) sprayed with Monceren® L-significantly decreased local transmission of the pathogen, suggesting lowered risk of occurrence of invasive epidemics. Our results highlight that detailed knowledge on epidemiological processes could contribute to the design of innovative management strategies based on precision agriculture tools to improve the efficacy of disease control and reduce pesticide use."

The urinary level of podocalyxin (PCX) is higher in various glomerular diseases, including MN. The aim of this study was to construct a diagnostic model of MN with the combination of urinary PCX and clinical parameters.We performed this cross-sectional study to construct the diagnostic models for MN by using data and samples from the multicenter kidney biopsy registry of Nagoya University and its affiliated hospitals. Urinary (u-) PCX was measured by sandwich ELISA. We constructed 3 types of diagnostic models in 105 training samples: u-PCX univariate model, the combined model of clinical parameters other than u-PCX (clinical model), and the combined model of both u-PCX and clinical parameters (combined model). We assessed the clinical usefulness of the diagnostic models through the comparison of c-statistics and decision curve analysis (DCA) in 209 validation samples.The clinical model consisted of age, glomerular filtration rate, and diabetes mellitus. In the training cohort, the c-statistics were 0.868 [95% CI, 0.799-0.937] in the combined model. In the validation cohort, sensitivity was 80.5% and specificity was 73.5% on the cut-off value. The net benefit of the combined model was better between threshold probabilities of 40-80% in DCA.In this study, we demonstrated the utility of u-PCX as a diagnostic marker for MN and the clinical usefulness of the diagnostic models, through the combination of u-PCX and clinical parameters including age, glomerular filtration rate, and diabetes mellitus."

In this study, a stable wheat-rye substitution line and 3 primary 1RS.1BL translocation lines were selected from the progeny of the crossing of the Chinese local rye Aigan variety and wheat cultivar Mianyang11. The substitution and translocation lines were identified by molecular cytogenetic analysis. PCR results, fluorescence in situ hybridization and acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that there were a pair of 1R chromosomes in the substitution line which have been named RS1200-3, and a pair of 1RS.1BL translocation chromosomes in the other 3 translocation lines, which have been named RT1163-4, RT1217-1, and RT1249. When inoculated with stripe rust isolates, these 4 lines expressed high resistance to several Puccinia striiformis f. sp Tritici pathotypes that are virulent on Yr9. Moreover, the different response pattern of resistance among them suggested that the diversity of resistance genes for wheat stripe rust exists in the rye. These 4 lines also showed better agronomic performances than their wheat parent. The GS indices also showed the genetic diversity of the 1RS which derived from same rye variety. The present study indicates that rye cultivars may carry untapped variations that could potentially be used for wheat improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2521627791,"Membrane fusions that occur during vesicle transport, virus infection, and tissue development, involve receptors that mediate membrane contact and initiate fusion and effectors that execute membrane reorganization and fusion pore formation. Some of these fusogenic receptors/effectors are preferentially recruited to lipid raft membrane microdomains. Therefore, major constituents of lipid rafts, such as stomatin, may be involved in the regulation of cell–cell fusion. Stomatin produced in cells can be released to the extracellular environment, either through protein refolding topass across lipid bilayer or through exosome trafficking. We report that cells expressing more stomatin or exposed to exogenous stomatin are more prone to undergoing cell fusion. During osteoclastogenesis, depletion of stomatin inhibited cell fusion but had little effect on tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase production. Moreover, in stomatin transgenic mice, increased cell fusion leading to enhanced bone resorption and subsequent osteoporosis were observed. With its unique molecular topology, stomatin forms molecular assembly within lipid rafts or on the appositional plasma membranes, and promotes membrane fusion by modulating fusogenic protein engagement.—Lee, J.-H., Hsieh, C.-F., Liu, H.-W., Chen, C.-Y., Wu, S.-C., Chen, T.-W., Hsu, C.-S., Liao, Y.-H., Yang, C.-Y., Shyu, J.-F., Fischer, W.

https://openalex.org/W2523789117,"Twitter channels are increasingly popular at medical conferences. Many groups, including healthcare providers and third party entities (e.g., pharmaceutical or medical device companies) use these channels to communicate with one another. These channels are unregulated and can allow third party commercial entities to exert an equal or greater amount of Twitter influence than healthcare providers. Third parties can use this influence to promote their products or services instead of sharing unbiased, evidence-based information. In this investigation we quantified the Twitter influence that third party commercial entities had in 13 major medical conferences.We analyzed tweets contained in the official Twitter hashtags of thirteen medical conferences from 2011 to 2013. We placed tweet authors into one of four categories based on their account profile: healthcare provider, third party commercial entity, none of the above and unknown. We measured Twitter activity by the number of tweet authors per category and the tweet-to-author ratio by category. We measured Twitter influence by the PageRank of tweet authors by category.We analyzed 51159 tweets authored by 8778 Twitter account holders in 13 conferences that were sponsored by 5 medical societies. A quarter of all authors identified themselves as healthcare providers, while only 18% could be identified as third party commercial entities. Healthcare providers had a greater tweet-to-author ratio than their third party commercial entity counterparts (8.98 versus 6.93 tweets). Despite having less authors and composing less tweets, third party commercial entities had a statistically similar PageRank as healthcare providers (0.761 versus 0.797).The Twitter influence of third party commercial entities (PageRank) is similar to that of healthcare providers. This finding is interesting because the number of tweets and third party commercial entity authors required to achieve this PageRank is far fewer than that needed by healthcare providers. Without safety mechanisms in place, the Twitter channels of medical conferences can devolve into a venue for the spread of biased information rather than evidence-based medical knowledge that is expected at live conferences. Continuing to measure the Twitter influence that third parties exert can help conference organizers develop reasonable guidelines for Twitter channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2526856958,"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal type of malignant tumor in gynecological cancers and is associated with a high percentage of late diagnosis and chemotherapy resistance. Thus, it is urgent to identify a tumor marker or a molecular target that allows early detection and effective treatment. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are crucial in various cellular processes at the post-transcriptional level. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma, 1(eIF4G1), an RNA-binding protein, facilitates the recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome, which is a rate-limiting step during the initiation phase of protein synthesis. However, little is known regarding the characteristics of eIF4G1 expression and its clinical significance in ovarian cancer. Therefore, we propose to investigate the expression and clinicopathological significance of eIF4G1 in ovarian cancer patients.We performed Real-time PCR in 40 fresh serous ovarian cancer tissues and 27 normal ovarian surface epithelial cell specimens to assess eIF4G1mRNA expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine the expression of eIF4G1 at the protein level in 134 patients with serous ovarian cancer and 18 normal ovarian tissues. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine the correlation of the eIF4G1 protein levels with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in ovarian cancer.The expression of eIF4G1 was upregulated in serous ovarian cancer tissues at both the mRNA (P = 0.0375) and the protein (P = 0.0007) levels. The eIF4G1 expression was significantly correlated with the clinical tumor stage (P = 0.0004) and omentum metastasis (P = 0.024). Moreover, patients with low eIF4G1 protein expression had a longer overall survival time (P = 0.026).These data revealed that eIF4G1 is markedly expressed in serous ovarian cancer and that upregulation of the eIF4G1 protein expression is significantly associated with an advanced tumor stage. Besides, the patients with lower expression of eIF4G1 tend to have a longer overall survival time. Thus, eIF4G1 may contribute to the occurrence and metastasis of ovarian cancer and can serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2524392742,"Francisella tularensis is classified as a Class A bioterrorism agent by the U.S. government due to its high virulence and the ease with which it can be spread as an aerosol. It is a facultative intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of tularemia. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) is a broad spectrum antibiotic effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Increased Cipro resistance in pathogenic microbes is of serious concern when considering options for medical treatment of bacterial infections. Identification of genes and loci that are associated with Ciprofloxacin resistance will help advance the understanding of resistance mechanisms and may, in the future, provide better treatment options for patients. It may also provide information for development of assays that can rapidly identify Cipro-resistant isolates of this pathogen. In this study, we selected a large number of F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) isolates that survived in progressively higher Ciprofloxacin concentrations, screened the isolates using a whole genome F. tularensis LVS tiling microarray and Illumina sequencing, and identified both known and novel mutations associated with resistance. Genes containing mutations encode DNA gyrase subunit A, a hypothetical protein, an asparagine synthase, a sugar transamine/perosamine synthetase and others. Structural modeling performed on these proteins provides insights into the potential function of these proteins and how they might contribute to Cipro resistance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2524868393,"The generation of functionally distinct neuronal subtypes within the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) requires the precise regulation of progenitor gene expression in specific neuronal territories during early embryogenesis. Accumulating evidence has implicated histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins in cell specification, proliferation, and differentiation in diverse embryonic and adult tissues. However, although HDAC proteins have shown to be expressed in the developing vertebrate neural tube, their specific role in CNS neural progenitor fate specification remains unclear. Prior work from our lab showed that the Tcf7l2/Tcf4 transcription factor plays a key role in ventral progenitor lineage segregation by differential repression of two key specification factors, Nkx2.2 and Olig2. In this study, we found that administration of HDAC inhibitors (Valproic Acid (VPA), Trichostatin-A (TSA), or sodium butyrate) in chick embryos in ovo disrupted normal progenitor gene segregation in the developing neural tube, indicating that HDAC activity is required for this process. Further, using functional and pharmacological approaches in vivo, we found that HDAC activity is required for the differential repression of Nkx2.2 and Olig2 by Tcf7l2/Tcf4. Finally, using dominant-negative functional assays, we provide evidence that Tcf7l2/Tcf4 repression also requires Gro/TLE/Grg co-repressor factors. Together, our data support a model where the transcriptional repressor activity of Tcf7l2/Tcf4 involves functional interactions with both HDAC and Gro/TLE/Grg co-factors at specific target gene regulatory elements in the developing neural tube, and that this activity is required for the proper segregation of the Nkx2.2 (p3) and Olig2 (pMN) expressing cells from a common progenitor pool."
https://openalex.org/W2525477089,"The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, is one of the most important pests of cruciferous crops. We have earlier shown that N6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-adenosine (HEA) exhibits insecticidal activity against P. xylostella. In the present study we investigated the possible mechanism of insecticidal action of HEA on P. xylostella. HEA is a derivative of adenosine, therefore, we speculated whether it acts via P. xylostella adenosine receptor (PxAdoR). We used RNAi approach to silence PxAdoR gene and used antagonist of denosine receptor (AdoR) to study the insecticidal effect of HEA. We cloned the whole sequence of PxAdoR gene. A BLAST search using NCBI protein database showed a 61% identity with the Drosophila adenosine receptor (DmAdoR) and a 32-35% identity with human AdoR. Though the amino acids sequence of PxAdoR was different compared to other adenosine receptors, most of the amino acids that are known to be important for adenosine receptor ligand binding and signaling were present. However, only 30% binding sites key residues was similar between PxAdoR and A1R. HEA, at a dose of 1 mg/mL, was found to be lethal to the second-instar larvae of P. xylostella, and a significant reduction of mortality and growth inhibition ratio were obtained when HEA was administered to the larvae along with PxAdoR-dsRNA or antagonist of AdoR (SCH58261) for 36, 48, or 60 h. Especially at 48 h, the rate of growth inhibition of the PxAdoR knockdown group was 3.5-fold less than that of the HEA group, and the corrected mortality of SCH58261 group was reduced almost 2-fold compared with the HEA group. Our findings show that HEA may exert its insecticidal activity against P. xylostella larvae via acting on PxAdoR."

Phylogenetic resolution in groups of Cretaceous age has proven particularly difficult and requires large quantity of data. In this study, we investigated 100 nuclear genes in order to select a number of markers with low evolutionary rates and high phylogenetic signal. A PCR screening using degenerate primers was applied to 26 different weevil species. We obtained sequences from 57 of the 100 targeted genes. Sequences from each nuclear marker were aligned and examined for detecting multiple copies, pseudogenes and introns. Phylogenetic informativeness (PI) and the capacity for reconstruction of previously established phylogenetic relationships were used as proxies for selecting a subset of the 57 amplified genes. Finally, we selected 16 markers suitable for large-scale phylogenetics of Scolytinae and related weevil taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2523935786,"The interaction of Leishmania with BALB/c mice induces dramatic changes in transcriptome patterns in the parasite, but also in the target organs (spleen, liver…) due to its response against infection. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is an interesting approach to analyze these changes and understand the immunological pathways that lead to protection or progression of disease. However, qPCR results need to be normalized against one or more reference genes (RG) to correct for non-specific experimental variation. The development of technical platforms for high-throughput qPCR analysis, and powerful software for analysis of qPCR data, have acknowledged the problem that some reference genes widely used due to their known or suspected “housekeeping” roles, should be avoided due to high expression variability across different tissues or experimental conditions. In this paper we evaluated the stability of 112 genes using three different algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder in spleen samples from BALB/c mice under different experimental conditions (control and Leishmania infantum-infected mice). Despite minor discrepancies in the stability ranking shown by the three methods, most genes show very similar performance as RG (either good or poor) across this massive data set. Our results show that some of the genes traditionally used as RG in this model (i.e. B2m, Polr2a and Tbp) are clearly outperformed by others. In particular, the combination of Il2rg + Itgb2 was identified among the best scoring candidate RG for every group of mice and every algorithm used in this experimental model. Finally, we have demonstrated that using “traditional” vs rationally-selected RG for normalization of gene expression data may lead to loss of statistical significance of gene expression changes when using large-scale platforms, and therefore misinterpretation of results. Taken together, our results highlight the need for a comprehensive, high-throughput search for the most stable reference genes in each particular experimental model."
https://openalex.org/W2524872034,"Mercury is a ubiquitous metal contaminant that negatively impacts reproduction of wildlife and has many other sub-lethal effects. Songbirds are sensitive bioindicators of mercury toxicity and may suffer population declines as a result of mercury pollution. Current predictions of mercury accumulation and biomagnification often overlook possible genetic variation in mercury uptake and elimination within species and the potential for evolution in affected populations. We conducted a study of dietary mercury exposure in a model songbird species, maintaining a breeding population of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) on standardized diets ranging from 0.0–2.4 μg/g methylmercury. We applied a quantitative genetics approach to examine patterns of variation and heritability of mercury accumulation within dietary treatments using a method of mixed effects modeling known as the 'animal model'. Significant variation in blood mercury accumulation existed within each treatment for birds exposed at the same dietary level; moreover, this variation was highly repeatable for individuals. We observed substantial genetic variation in blood mercury accumulation for birds exposed at intermediate dietary concentrations. Taken together, this is evidence that genetic variation for factors affecting blood mercury accumulation could be acted on by selection. If similar heritability for mercury accumulation exists in wild populations, selection could result in genetic differentiation for populations in contaminated locations, with possible consequences for mercury biomagnification in food webs."

Relative contributions to atrophy from disuse, fibrosis, denervation, and satellite-cell responsiveness to activating stimuli are not known.Potential contributions of denervation and disrupted satellite cell responses to growth signals were examined in supraspinatus (SS) and control (ipsilateral deltoid) muscles biopsied from participants with RCI (N = 27). Biopsies were prepared for explant culture (to study satellite cell activity), immunostained to localize Pax7, BrdU, and Semaphorin 3A in satellite cells, sectioning to study blood vessel density, and western blotting to measure the fetal (γ) subunit of acetylcholine receptor (γ-AchR). Principal component analysis (PCA) for 35 parameters extracted components identified variables that contributed most to variability in the dataset. γ-AchR was higher in SS than control, indicating denervation. Satellite cells in SS had a low baseline level of activity (Pax7+ cells labelled in S-phase) versus control; only satellite cells in SS showed increased proliferative activity after nitric oxide-donor treatment. Interestingly, satellite cell localization of Semaphorin 3A, a neuro-chemorepellent, was greater in SS (consistent with fiber denervation) than control muscle at baseline. PCAs extracted components including fiber atrophy, satellite cell activity, fibrosis, atrogin-1, smoking status, vascular density, γAchR, and the time between symptoms and surgery. Use of deltoid as a control for SS was supported by PCA findings since ""muscle"" was not extracted as a variable in the first two principal components. SS muscle in RCI is therefore atrophic, denervated, and fibrotic, and has satellite cells that respond to activating stimuli.Since SS satellite cells can be activated in culture, a NO-donor drug combined with stretching could promote muscle growth and improve functional outcome after RCI. PCAs suggest indices including satellite cell responsiveness, atrogin-1, atrophy, and innervation may predict surgical outcome."

Independent variables considered were: type of shaker used (five or 17 holes), amount of salt in the shaker before shaking commences (shaker full, half full or nearly empty), time spent shaking (3s, 5s or 10s), and individual serving.Controlled, laboratory, conditions.A quota-based convenience sample of 10 participants (five women) aged 18-59 years.Amount of salt delivered by salt shakers.Across all trials, the 17 holed shaker delivered a mean (SD) of 7.86g (4.54) per trial, whilst the five holed shaker delivered 2.65g (1.22). The five holed shaker delivered a mean of 33.7% of the salt of the 17 holed shaker. There was a significant difference in salt delivered between the five and 17 holed salt shakers when time spent shaking, amount of salt in the shaker and participant were all kept constant (p<0.001). This difference was robust to variations in the starting weight of shakers, time spent shaking and participant shaking (ps</ = 0.001).Five holed salt shakers have the potential to reduce the salt content of takeaway food, and particularly food from Fish & Chip shops, where these shakers are particularly used.

https://openalex.org/W2526568010,"Plant viral movement proteins facilitate virion movement mainly through interaction with a number of factors from the host. We report the association of a cell wall localized ascorbate oxidase (CsAO4) from Cucumis sativus with the movement protein (MP) of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). This was identified first in a yeast two-hybrid screen and validated by in vivo pull down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. The BiFC assay showed localization of the bimolecular complexes of these proteins around the cell wall periphery as punctate spots. The expression of CsAO4 was induced during the initial infection period (up to 72 h) in CMV infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants. To functionally validate its role in viral spread, we analyzed the virus accumulation in CsAO4 overexpressing Arabidopsis thaliana and transiently silenced N. benthamiana plants (through a Tobacco rattle virus vector). Overexpression had no evident effect on virus accumulation in upper non-inoculated leaves of transgenic lines in comparison to WT plants at 7 days post inoculation (dpi). However, knockdown resulted in reduced CMV accumulation in systemic (non-inoculated) leaves of NbΔAO-pTRV2 silenced plants as compared to TRV inoculated control plants at 5 dpi (up to 1.3 fold difference). In addition, functional validation supported the importance of AO in plant development. These findings suggest that AO and viral MP interaction helps in early viral movement; however, it had no major effect on viral accumulation after 7 dpi. This study suggests that initial induction of expression of AO on virus infection and its association with viral MP helps both towards targeting of the MP to the apoplast and disrupting formation of functional AO dimers for spread of virus to nearby cells, reducing the redox defense of the plant during initial stages of infection."

Those female mice were administered subcutaneously deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt tablets plus drinking water that contained 1% saline for 28 d after uninephrectomy. In L-FABP+/- AT1a+/+ mice that received DOCA-salt treatment, hypertension was induced and slight expansion of glomerular area, glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial damage were observed. In L-FABP+/- AT1a-/- mice that received DOCA-salt treatment, hypertension was similarly induced and the degree of glomerular damage was significantly more severe than in L-FABP+/- AT1a+/+-DOCA mice. Urinary L-FABP levels were significantly higher in L-FABP+/- AT1a-/--DOCA mice compared with those in L-FABP+/- AT1a+/+-DOCA mice. Hydralazine treatment significantly attenuated renal damage that was found in L-FABP+/- AT1a-/--DOCA mice along with a reduction in blood pressure. In summary, activation of the AT1a receptor may contribute to maintenance of the glomerular structure against hypertensive renal damage.-Hisamichi, M., Kamijo-Ikemori, A., Sugaya, T., Ichikawa, D., Natsuki, T., Hoshino, S., Kimura, K., Shibagaki, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2524466931,"Soybean oil content is one of main quality traits. In this study, we used the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method and a soybean high-density genetic map including 5,308 markers to identify stable single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-SNP interactions controlling oil content in soybean across 23 environments. In total, 36,442,756 SNP-SNP interaction pairs were detected, 1865 of all interaction pairs associated with soybean oil content were identified under multiple environments by the Bonferroni correction with p <3.55×10-11. Two and 1863 SNP-SNP interaction pairs detected stable across 12 and 11 environments, respectively, which account around 50% of total environments. Epistasis values and contribution rates of stable interaction (the SNP interaction pairs were detected in more than 2 environments) pairs were detected by the two way ANOVA test, the available interaction pairs were ranged 0.01 to 0.89 and from 0.01 to 0.85, respectively. Some of one side of the interaction pairs were identified with previously research as a major QTL without epistasis effects. The results of this study provide insights into the genetic architecture of soybean oil content and can serve as a basis for marker-assisted selection breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2525219082,"The polio eradication programme in Nigeria has been successful in reducing incidence to just six confirmed cases in 2014 and zero to date in 2015, but prediction and management of future outbreaks remains a concern. A Poisson mixed effects model was used to describe poliovirus spread between January 2001 and November 2013, incorporating the strength of connectivity between districts (local government areas, LGAs) as estimated by three models of human mobility: simple distance, gravity and radiation models. Potential explanatory variables associated with the case numbers in each LGA were investigated and the model fit was tested by simulation. Spatial connectivity, the number of non-immune children under five years old, and season were associated with the incidence of poliomyelitis in an LGA (all P < 0.001). The best-fitting spatial model was the radiation model, outperforming the simple distance and gravity models (likelihood ratio test P < 0.05), under which the number of people estimated to move from an infected LGA to an uninfected LGA was strongly associated with the incidence of poliomyelitis in that LGA. We inferred transmission networks between LGAs based on this model and found these to be highly local, largely restricted to neighbouring LGAs (e.g. 67.7% of secondary spread from Kano was expected to occur within 10 km). The remaining secondary spread occurred along routes of high population movement. Poliovirus transmission in Nigeria is predominantly localised, occurring between spatially contiguous areas. Outbreak response should be guided by knowledge of high-probability pathways to ensure vulnerable children are protected."
https://openalex.org/W2526330663,"Behaviour models are the most commonly used input for predicting the reliability of a software system at the early design stage. A component behaviour model reveals the structure and behaviour of the component during the execution of system-level functionalities. There are various challenges related to component reliability prediction at the early design stage based on behaviour models. For example, most of the current reliability techniques do not provide fine-grained sequential behaviour models of individual components and fail to consider the loop entry and exit points in the reliability computation. Moreover, some of the current techniques do not tackle the problem of operational data unavailability and the lack of analysis results that can be valuable for software architects at the early design stage. This paper proposes a reliability prediction technique that, pragmatically, synthesizes system behaviour in the form of a state machine, given a set of scenarios and corresponding constraints as input. The state machine is utilized as a base for generating the component-relevant operational data. The state machine is also used as a source for identifying the nodes and edges of a component probabilistic dependency graph (CPDG). Based on the CPDG, a stack-based algorithm is used to compute the reliability. The proposed technique is evaluated by a comparison with existing techniques and the application of sensitivity analysis to a robotic wheelchair system as a case study. The results indicate that the proposed technique is more relevant at the early design stage compared to existing works, and can provide a more realistic and meaningful prediction."
