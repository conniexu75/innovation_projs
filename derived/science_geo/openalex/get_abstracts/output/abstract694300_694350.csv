https://openalex.org/W4281567855,"How does the organization of neural information processing enable humans' sophisticated cognition? Here we decompose functional interactions between brain regions into synergistic and redundant components, revealing their distinct information-processing roles. Combining functional and structural neuroimaging with meta-analytic results, we demonstrate that redundant interactions are predominantly associated with structurally coupled, modular sensorimotor processing. Synergistic interactions instead support integrative processes and complex cognition across higher-order brain networks. The human brain leverages synergistic information to a greater extent than nonhuman primates, with high-synergy association cortices exhibiting the highest degree of evolutionary cortical expansion. Synaptic density mapping from positron emission tomography and convergent molecular and metabolic evidence demonstrate that synergistic interactions are supported by receptor diversity and human-accelerated genes underpinning synaptic function. This information-resolved approach provides analytic tools to disentangle information integration from coupling, enabling richer, more accurate interpretations of functional connectivity, and illuminating how the human neurocognitive architecture navigates the trade-off between robustness and integration."
https://openalex.org/W4281550473,"Sleep disturbances frequently occur in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, but the developmental role of sleep is largely unexplored, and a causal relationship between developmental sleep defects and behavioral consequences in adulthood remains elusive. Here, we show that in mice, sleep disruption (SD) in adolescence, but not in adulthood, causes long-lasting impairment in social novelty preference. Furthermore, adolescent SD alters the activation and release patterns of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in response to social novelty. This developmental sleep function is mediated by balanced VTA activity during adolescence; chemogenetic excitation mimics, whereas silencing rescues, the social deficits of adolescent SD. Finally, we show that in Shank3-mutant mice, improving sleep or rectifying VTA activity during adolescence ameliorates adult social deficits. Together, our results identify a critical role of sleep and dopaminergic activity in the development of social interaction behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4281653388,"Inflammatory biomarkers are associated with severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, direct comparisons of their utility in COVID-19 versus other respiratory infections are largely missing.We aimed to investigate the prognostic utility of various inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 compared to patients with other respiratory infections.Patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled. Levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, and leukocytes were compared between COVID-19, other viral respiratory infections, and bacterial pneumonia. Primary outcome was the need for hospitalisation, secondary outcome was the composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death at 30 days.Among 514 patients with confirmed respiratory infections, 191 (37%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, 227 (44%) with another viral respiratory infection (viral controls), and 96 (19%) with bacterial pneumonia (bacterial controls). All inflammatory biomarkers differed significantly between diagnoses and were numerically higher in hospitalized patients, regardless of diagnoses. Discriminative accuracy for hospitalisation was highest for IL-6 and CRP in all three diagnoses (in COVID-19, area under the curve (AUC) for IL-6 0.899 [95%CI 0.850-0.948]; AUC for CRP 0.922 [95%CI 0.879-0.964]). Similarly, IL-6 and CRP ranged among the strongest predictors for ICU admission or death at 30 days in COVID-19 (AUC for IL-6 0.794 [95%CI 0.694-0.894]; AUC for CRP 0.807 [95%CI 0.721-0.893]) and both controls. Predictive values of inflammatory biomarkers were generally higher in COVID-19 than in controls.In patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, inflammatory biomarkers harbour strong prognostic information, particularly IL-6 and CRP. Their routine use may support early management decisions."
https://openalex.org/W4282017374,"Asthma is a disease characterized by airway epithelial barrier destruction, chronic airway inflammation, and airway remodeling. Repeated damage to airway epithelial cells by allergens in the environment plays an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma. Ferroptosis is a novel form of regulated cell death mediated by lipid peroxidation in association with free iron-mediated Fenton reactions. In this study, we explored the contribution of ferroptosis to house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma models. Our in vivo and in vitro models showed labile iron accumulation and enhanced lipid peroxidation with concomitant nonapoptotic cell death upon HDM exposure. Treatment with ferroptosis inhibitors deferoxamine (DFO) and ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) illuminated the role of ferroptosis and related damage-associated molecular patterns in HDM-treated airway epithelial cells. Furthermore, DFO and Fer-1 reduced HDM-induced airway inflammation in model mice. Mechanistically, NCOA4-mediated ferritin-selective autophagy (ferritinophagy) was initiated during ferritin degradation in response to HDM exposure. Together, these data suggest that ferroptosis plays an important role in HDM-induced asthma and that ferroptosis may be a potential treatment target for HDM-induced asthma."
https://openalex.org/W4281703296,"The long-term effects of mild TBI (mTBI) are not well understood, and there is an ongoing debate about whether there are sex differences in outcomes following mTBI. This study examined i) symptom burden and functional outcomes at 8-years post-injury in males and females following mTBI; ii) sex differences in outcomes at 8-years post-injury for those aged <45 years and ≥45 years and; iii) sex differences in outcomes for single and repetitive TBI. Adults (≥16 years at injury) identified as part of a population-based TBI incidence study (BIONIC) who experienced mTBI 8-years ago (N = 151) and a TBI-free sample (N = 151) completed self-report measures of symptoms and symptom burden (Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist), and functional outcomes (Participation Assessments with Recombined Tools, Work Limitations Questionnaire). The mTBI group reported significantly greater post-concussion symptoms compared to the TBI-free group (F(1,298) = 26.84, p<.01, ηp2 = .08). Females with mTBI were twice as likely to exceed clinical cut-offs for post-concussive (X2 (1)>5.2, p<.05, V>.19) and PTSD symptoms (X2(1) = 6.10, p = .014, V = .20) compared to the other groups, and reported their health had the greatest impact on time-related work demands (F(1,171) = 4.36, p = .04, ηp2 = .03. There was no interaction between sex and age on outcomes. The repetitive mTBI group reported significantly greater post-concussion symptoms (F(1,147) = 9.80, p<.01, ηp2 = .06) compared to the single mTBI group. Twice the proportion of women with repetitive mTBI exceeded the clinical cut-offs for post-concussive (X2(1)>6.90, p<.01, V>.30), anxiety (X2(1)>3.95, p<.05, V>.23) and PTSD symptoms (X2(1)>5.11, p<.02, V>.26) compared with males with repetitive TBI or women with single TBI. Thus, at 8-years post-mTBI, people continued to report a high symptom burden. Women with mTBI, particularly those with a history of repetitive mTBI, had the greatest symptom burden and were most likely to have symptoms of clinical significance. When treating mTBI it is important to assess TBI history, particularly in women. This may help identify those at greatest risk of poor long-term outcomes to direct early treatment and intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4281684961,"To perform a mental health evaluation and an early psychological intervention for healthcare workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, an online survey was conducted among 3055 HCWs in the paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) of 62 hospitals in China on March 26, 2020, by the Neurology and Sedation Professional Group, Emergency Department, Paediatrics Branch, Chinese Medical Association. The questionnaire was divided into three parts, including general information, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The results show that a total of 970 HCWs (45.99%) were considered to meet the clinical cut-off scores for posttraumatic stress (PTS), and the proportions of participants with mild to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were 39.69%, 36.46% and 17.12%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the psychological impact among HCWs of different genders. Married HCWs were 1.48 times more likely to have PTS than unmarried HCWs (95% Cl: 1.20-1.82, p <0.001). Compared with junior professional title participants, the PTS-positive rate of HCWs with intermediate professional titles was 1.91 times higher (90% Cl: 1.35-2.70, p<0.01). Those who had been in contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were 1.40 times (95% Cl: 1.02-1.92, p <0.05) more likely to have PTS than those who did not have contact with COVID-19 cases or did not know the relevant conditions. For depression, the proportion of HCWs with intermediate professional titles was significantly higher, at 1.65 times (90% Cl: 1.17-2.33, p <0.01) that of those with junior professional titles. The depression of HCWs at work during the epidemic was 1.56 times that of HCWs on vacation (95% Cl: 1.03-2.37, p <0.05), and their anxiety was 1.70 times greater (95% Cl: 1.10-2.63, p <0.05). Participants who had been in contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases had more pronounced anxiety, 1.40 times that of those who did not have contact with COVID-19 cases or did not know the relevant conditions (95% Cl: 1.02-1.92, p <0.05). There was no significant correlation between the variables and the positive results of stress symptoms. In total, 45.99%, 39.69%, 36.46% and 17.12% of PICU HCWs were affected by PTS, depression, anxiety and stress, respectively, to varying degree. Married status, intermediate professional titles and exposure history were independent risk factors for PTS. Intermediate professional titles and going to work during the epidemic were independent risk factors for depression, and going to work and exposure history during the epidemic were independent risk factors for anxiety. In the face of public health emergencies, HCWs not only specialize in paediatric intensive care but also, as a high-risk group, must actively take preventive measures and use mitigation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4281888698,"In the northern hemisphere, humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) typically migrate between summer/autumn feeding grounds at high latitudes, and specific winter/spring breeding grounds at low latitudes. Northeast Atlantic (NEA) humpback whales for instance forage in the Barents Sea and breed either in the West Indies, or the Cape Verde Islands, undertaking the longest recorded mammalian migration (~ 9 000 km). However, in the past decade hundreds of individuals have been observed foraging on herring during the winter in fjord systems along the northern Norwegian coast, with unknown consequences to their migration phenology, breeding behavior and energy budgets. Here we present the first complete migration track (321 days, January 8th, 2019-December 6th, 2019) of a humpback whale, a pregnant female that was equipped with a satellite tag in northern Norway. We show that whales can use foraging grounds in the NEA (Barents Sea, coastal Norway, and Iceland) sequentially within the same migration cycle, foraging in the Barents Sea in summer/fall and in coastal Norway and Iceland in winter. The migration speed was fast (1.6 ms-1), likely to account for the long migration distance (18 300 km) and long foraging season, but varied throughout the migration, presumably in response to the calf's needs after its birth. The energetic cost of this migration was higher than for individuals belonging to other populations. Our results indicate that large whales can modulate their migration speed to balance foraging opportunities with migration phenology, even for the longest migrations and under the added constraint of reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W4281986473,"Early detection of breast cancer plays a critical role in successful treatment that saves thousands of lives of patients every year. Despite massive clinical data have been collected and stored by healthcare organizations, only a small portion of the data has been used to support decision-making for treatments. In this study, we proposed an engineered up-sampling method (ENUS) for handling imbalanced data to improve predictive performance of machine learning models. Our experiment results showed that when the ratio of the minority to the majority class is less than 20%, training models with ENUS improved the balanced accuracy 3.74%, sensitivity 8.36% and F1 score 3.83%. Our study also identified that XGBoost Tree ( XGBTree ) using ENUS achieved the best performance with an average balanced accuracy of 97.47% (min = 93%, max = 100%), sensitivity of 97.88% (min = 89% and max = 100%), and F1 score of 96.20% (min = 89.5%, max = 100%) in the validation dataset. Furthermore, our ensemble algorithm identified Cell_Shape and Nuclei as the most important attributes in predicting breast cancer. The finding re-affirms the previous knowledge of the relationship between Cell_Shape , Nuclei , and the grades of breast cancer using a data-driven approach. Finally, our experiment showed that Random Forest and Neural Network models had the least training time. Our study provided a comprehensive comparison of a wide range of machine learning methods in predicting breast cancer risk. It can be used as a tool for healthcare practitioners to effectively detect and treat breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4281746903,"Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) is the endogenous opioid agonist for the N/OFQ receptor or NOP. This receptor system is involved in pain processing but also has a role in immune regulation. Indeed, polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) express mRNA for N/OFQ precursor and are a potential source for circulating N/OFQ. Current measurements are based on ELISA and RIA techniques. In this study we have designed a bioassay to measure N/OFQ release from single PMNs. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the human (h) NOP receptor and Gαiq5 chimera force receptor coupling in biosensor cells to increase intracellular Ca2+; this can be measured with FLUO-4 dye. If isolated PMNs from healthy human volunteers are layered next to CHOhNOPGαiq5 biosensor cells then stimulated with the chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) we hypothesise that released N/OFQ will activate the biosensor. PMNs also release ATP and CHO cells express purinergic receptors coupled to elevated Ca2+. In a system where these receptors (P2Y1, P2Y2 and P2X7) are blocked with high concentrations of PPADS and oATP, PMN stimulation with fMLP increases Ca2+ in PMNs then shortly afterwards the biosensor cells. Our data therfore reports detection of single cell N/OFQ release from immune cells. This was absent when cells were preincubated with the selective NOP antagonist; SB-612111. Collectively this is the first description of single cell N/OFQ release. We will deploy this assay with further purified individual cell types and use this to further study the role of the N/OFQ-NOP system in disease; in particular sepsis where there is strong evidence for increased levels of N/OFQ worsening outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4281836236,"Premenstrual symptoms can negatively impact the quality of life of women through a range of mood, behavioral, and physical symptoms. The association between the microbiota and brain function has been extensively studied. Here, we examined the characteristics of the microbiota in women with premenstrual disorders (PMDs) and the association between premenstrual symptoms and the microbiota.In this single center cross-sectional pilot study, we recruited 27 women reporting premenstrual symptoms and 29 women with no serious premenstrual symptoms. Among them, we further selected 21 women experiencing premenstrual symptoms resulting in interference to their social life (PMDs group) and 22 women with no serious premenstrual symptoms and thereby no interference to their social life (control group). The severity of symptoms was evaluated by a premenstrual symptoms questionnaire (PSQ). Inflammatory markers were analyzed in blood samples, including C reactive protein, soluble CD14, and lipopolysaccharide binding protein. Sequencing of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid genes was performed on stool samples.Inflammatory markers in blood samples did not differ significantly between the PMDs and control groups. A difference in beta, but not alpha diversity, was detected for the gut microbiotas of the PMDs and control groups. The relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum was lower in the PMDs group. At the genus level, the prevalence was decreased for Butyricicoccus, Extibacter, Megasphaera, and Parabacteroides and increased for Anaerotaenia in the PMDs group, but after false discovery rate correction, these differences were no longer significant. Linear discriminant effect size analysis revealed a decrease in Extibacter, Butyricicoccus, Megasphaera, and Parabacteroides and an increase in Anaerotaenia in the PMDs group. The PSQ total score correlated with Anaerotaenia, Extibacter, and Parabacteroides. Multiple regression analysis showed that Parabacteroides and Megasphaera negatively predicted the PSQ total score.The properties of the gut microbiota are associated with premenstrual symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W4281618127,"Background While health systems have implemented multifaceted interventions to improve physician and patient communication in serious illnesses such as cancer, clinicians vary in their response to these initiatives. In this secondary analysis of a randomized trial, we identified phenotypes of oncology clinicians based on practice pattern and demographic data, then evaluated associations between such phenotypes and response to a machine learning (ML)-based intervention to prompt earlier advance care planning (ACP) for patients with cancer. Methods and findings Between June and November 2019, we conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial testing the impact of text message prompts to 78 oncology clinicians at 9 oncology practices to perform ACP conversations among patients with cancer at high risk of 180-day mortality, identified using a ML prognostic algorithm. All practices began in the pre-intervention group, which received weekly emails about ACP performance only; practices were sequentially randomized to receive the intervention at 4-week intervals in a stepped-wedge design. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify oncologist phenotypes based on 11 baseline demographic and practice pattern variables identified using EHR and internal administrative sources. Difference-in-differences analyses assessed associations between oncologist phenotype and the outcome of change in ACP conversation rate, before and during the intervention period. Primary analyses were adjusted for patients’ sex, age, race, insurance status, marital status, and Charlson comorbidity index. The sample consisted of 2695 patients with a mean age of 64.9 years, of whom 72% were White, 20% were Black, and 52% were male. 78 oncology clinicians (42 oncologists, 36 advanced practice providers) were included. Three oncologist phenotypes were identified: Class 1 (n = 9) composed primarily of high-volume generalist oncologists, Class 2 (n = 5) comprised primarily of low-volume specialist oncologists; and 3) Class 3 (n = 28), composed primarily of high-volume specialist oncologists. Compared with class 1 and class 3, class 2 had lower mean clinic days per week (1.6 vs 2.5 [class 3] vs 4.4 [class 1]) a higher percentage of new patients per week (35% vs 21% vs 18%), higher baseline ACP rates (3.9% vs 1.6% vs 0.8%), and lower baseline rates of chemotherapy within 14 days of death (1.4% vs 6.5% vs 7.1%). Overall, ACP rates were 3.6% in the pre-intervention wedges and 15.2% in intervention wedges (11.6 percentage-point difference). Compared to class 3, oncologists in class 1 (adjusted percentage-point difference-in-differences 3.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 6.1, p = 0.006) and class 2 (adjusted percentage-point difference-in-differences 12.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.3 to 20.3, p = 0.003) had greater response to the intervention. Conclusions Patient volume and time availability may be associated with oncologists’ response to interventions to increase ACP. Future interventions to prompt ACP should prioritize making time available for such conversations between oncologists and their patients."
https://openalex.org/W4281724040,"A robust generalisation of the Gumbel distribution is proposed in this article. This family of distributions is based on the T-X paradigm. From a list of special distributions that have evolved as a result of this family, three separate models are also mentioned in this article. A linear combination of generalised exponential distributions can be used to characterise the density of a new family, which is critical in assessing some of the family's properties. The statistical features of this family are determined, including exact formulations for the quantile function, ordinary and incomplete moments, generating function, and order statistics. The model parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method. Further, one of the unique models has been systematically studied. Along with conventional skewness measures, MacGillivray skewness is also used to quantify the skewness measure. The new probability distribution also enables us to determine certain critical risk indicators, both numerically and graphically. We use a simulated assessment of the suggested distribution, as well as apply three real-world data sets in modelling the proposed model, in order to ensure its authenticity and superiority."
https://openalex.org/W4281729964,"Current knowledge of transitional care from the perspective of individuals with congenital malformations is scarce. Their viewpoints are required for the development of follow-up programs and transitional care corresponding to patients’ needs. The study aimed to describe expectations, concerns, and experiences in conjunction with transfer to adult health care among adolescents, young adults, and adults with VACTERL association, (i.e. vertebral defects, anorectal malformations (ARM), cardiac defects (CHD), esophageal atresia (EA), renal, and limb abnormalities). Semi-structured telephone interviews were performed and analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Of 47 invited individuals, 22 participated (12 males and 10 females). An overarching theme emerged: Leaving the safe nest of pediatric health care for an unfamiliar and uncertain follow up yet growing in responsibility and appreciating the adult health care. The participants described expectations of qualified adult health care but also concerns about the process and transfer to an unfamiliar setting. Individuals who were transferred described implemented or absence of preparations. Positive and negative experiences of adult health care were recounted including being treated as adults. The informants described increasing involvement in health care but were still supported by their parents. Ongoing follow up of health conditions was recounted but also uncertainty around the continuation, missing follow up and limited knowledge of how to contact health care. The participants recommended information ahead of transfer and expressed wishes for continued health care with regular follow up and accessibility to a contact person. Based on the participants’ perspective, a transitional plan is required including early information about transfer and follow up to prepare the adolescents and reduce uncertainty concerning future health care. Meetings with the pediatric and adult team together with the patient and the parents are essential before transfer. Follow up should be centralized to centers with multi-professional teams well-experienced with the condition. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the transition process for adolescents and young adults with complex congenital health conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4281740410,"Although patients with either β-thalassemia or chronic kidney disease (CKD) clinically correlate with severe osteoporosis, the mechanism by which CKD exposed to high phosphate affects bone turnover has not been characterized in β-thalassemia. We aimed to determine the effects of renal insufficiency on high phosphate intake induced changes in bone metabolism after 5/6 th nephrectomy in hemizygous β-globin knockout (BKO) mice. Male BKO mice manifested severe anemia and osteopenia. Nephrectomy induced renal fibrosis and reduced renal function as assessed by increased serum urea nitrogen levels. Moreover, nephrectomy increased bone turnover leading to bone loss in wild type (WT) but not BKO mice. In nephrectomized BKO, PBS in drinking water induced hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalcemia along with osteopenia in both cancellous and cortical bone. Histomorphometric analysis confirmed reduced cancellous bone volume due to decreased bone formation rate, osteoblast number and osteoclast number. The mRNA levels for Alpl , Sp7 , Kl , Tnfsf11 , and Tnfsf11/Tnfrsf11b were decreased in nephrectomized BKO mice drinking PBS. Interestingly, Fgf23 , a bone-derived hormone produced by osteocytes and osteoblasts in response to hyperphosphatemia, were remarkably increased in nephrectomized BKO mice following PBS intake. Serum FGF23 and erythropoietin levels were markedly elevated in BKO mice. Nephrectomy decreased serum erythropoietin but not FGF23 levels. Hyperphosphatemia in BKO mice increased serum erythropoietin, FGF23, and PTH levels, nominating these factors as candidate mediators of bone loss in thalassemic mice with CKD during phosphate retention."
https://openalex.org/W4281791151,"Introduction The modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) among married women has increased by nearly five-fold in Ethiopia from 8.1% in 2000 to 37% in 2019. Despite this increase, receipt of high quality contraceptive counselling, as measured by the percentage of contraceptive users who were told about other methods, counseled on side effects and counseled what to do in the event that they encountered side effects, has declined in recent years. The quality of family planning counseling service measured by using these three components, known as the Method Information Index(MII), is an index designed to measure quality and a key indicator of the FP2020 initiative. The effects of potential client and service provider-level factors on receipt of high quality counseling and its progress over time have not been well studied in Ethiopia. Methods We pooled data from seven Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA), formerly PMA2020, survey-rounds to examine the trend and effect of potential factors on receiving high quality of family planning counseling service in Ethiopia. Data from a total of 15,597 women aged 15 to 49 from seven survey-rounds were used in the analysis. To account for the study design and unequal probabilities of selection from target-populations for sampled women, design-based analysis was used to compute proportions. Multilevel ordinal regression model with enumeration area as a second level were employed to examine potential factors associated with quality of family planning counseling service. Results We found that the percentage of women who received high quality family planning counseling service declined from 39% (95%CI: 33%, 44%) in 2015 to 12% in 2019 (95% CI: 10%, 14%) nationally. Amhara region had the lowest percentage of women receiving high quality counseling at both the earliest(2014) and latest(2019) survey rounds(17% and 6%, respectively). Results show that lack of media exposure about family planning, having no formal education, using short-acting methods, and getting the service from pharmacy were the main factors associated with receiving low quality family planning counseling service. Conclusions Given the importance of continuous provision of information on the range of family planning methods, it is imperative to use media and particularly regional media which can effectively address the rural populations in local languages as an important vehicle of information on family planning. Interventions aimed at improving quality of family planning counseling need to be mindful of regional disparities in the severity of the problem to ensure equity in service access. To improve the coverage of high quality family planning counseling service, there is an urgent need to re-visit the format of family planning counselling services."
https://openalex.org/W4281849787,"The 11101 working face of Qipanjing Mine was taken as the research object to explore the dynamic change law of the spontaneous combustion of the remaining coal in the gob-side entry retaining goaf area. A sealed oxygen consumption experiment was conducted to determine the (critical) oxygen volume fraction in the suffocation zone and continuous oxygen consumption rate of coal samples. The parameters of the working face were measured on site, and the air volume fraction in the goaf was monitored using a beam tube. Considering upward ventilation and the effect of gravity, a UDF control program for the falling medium in the gob-side entry retaining goaf was written. Based on the experimental results, a control program for the continuous oxygen consumption rate of the remnant coal was compiled, the dynamic distribution of the flow field in the gob-side entry retaining goaf was simulated with different advancing positions and air leakage at the working face, and a prediction model for the spontaneous combustion danger area was established. Finally, fire prevention measures via grouting in the return air lane side and nitrogen injection in the retaining lane side were put forward. The results showed that with the variation in the advancing position of the working face or in the air leakage of the air intake lane, the range of the natural hazardous area of the gob-side entry retaining goaf presents a distribution with a power function SF = xn+b (0 < n < 1). The theoretically proposed fire-fighting measures can effectively reduce the risk of spontaneous combustion of coal."
https://openalex.org/W4281890930,"Hydrophilic materials immersed in aqueous solutions show near-surface zones that exclude suspended colloids and dissolved molecules. These exclusion zones (EZs) can extend for tens to hundreds of micrometers from hydrophilic surfaces and show physicochemical properties that differ from bulk water. Here we report that exposure of standard aqueous microsphere suspensions to static magnetic fields creates similar microsphere-free zones adjacent to magnetic poles. The EZs build next to both north and south poles; and they build whether the microspheres are of polystyrene or carboxylate composition. EZ formation is accompanied by ordered motions of microspheres, creating dense zones some distance from the magnetic poles and leaving microsphere-free zones adjacent to the magnet. EZ size was larger next to the north pole than the south pole. The difference was statistically significant when polystyrene microspheres were used, although not when carboxylate microspheres were used. In many ways, including both size and dynamics, these exclusion zones resemble those found earlier next to various hydrophilic surfaces. The ability to create EZs represents a feature of magnets not previously revealed."
https://openalex.org/W4281938358,"Globally, leopards are the most widespread large felid. However, mounting anthropogenic threats are rapidly reducing viable leopard populations and their range. Despite the clear pressures facing this species, there is a dearth of robust and reliable population and density estimates for leopards across their range, which is particularly important in landscapes that consist of protected and non-protected areas. We conducted a camera trapping survey between 2017 and 2018 in the Western Cape, South Africa to estimate the occupancy, density, and population size of a leopard population. Leopards were recorded at 95% of camera trapping sites, which resulted in a high occupancy that showed no significant variation between seasons, habitat types, or along an altitudinal gradient. Our results indicated a low leopard density in the study area, with an estimated 1.53 leopards/100 km2 in summer and 1.62 leopards/100 km2 in winter. Mean leopard population size was therefore estimated at 107 and 113 individuals in the winter and summer respectively. Leopard activity centres for female ranges were centred in the core study area and could be predicted with good certainty, while males appeared to move out of the study area during winter which resulted in a higher uncertainty in locations of activity centres. Interestingly, livestock depredation events in the surrounding farmlands were significantly higher in winter, which coincides with male leopards moving outside the core protected area into the surrounding farmlands. To reduce livestock losses and retaliatory leopard killings, we suggest that human-carnivore conflict mitigation measures be intensely monitored during the winter months in the study area. We also suggest that future leopard conservation efforts should focus on privately-owned land as these non-protected areas contain the majority of the remaining suitable leopard habitat and may provide important dispersal corridors and buffer zones on which the long-term sustainability of leopard populations depends."
https://openalex.org/W4281662521,"Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent. However, its clinical utility is limited because of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) was found to play a vital role in reducing cisplatin ototoxicity in mice. Deletion polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1, members of the GST family, are common in humans and are presumed to be associated with cisplatin-induced hearing impairment. However, the specific roles of GSTM1 and GSTT1 in cisplatin ototoxicity are not completely clear. Here, under cisplatin treatment, simultaneous deletion of Gstm1 and Gstt1 lead to a more profound hearing loss in CBA/CaJ mice (Gstm1/Gstt1-DKO) than in wild-type mice. The Gstm1/Gstt1-DKO mice, in which phase II detoxification genes were upregulated, exhibited more severe oxidative stress and higher outer hair cell apoptosis in the cochleae than the control mice. Thus, our study revealed that Gstm1 and Gstt1 protect auditory hair cells from cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in the CBA/CaJ mice, and genetic screening for GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms could help determine a standard cisplatin dose for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4281675157,"We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the involvement of histone H3 and H4 residues in the regulation of chronological lifespan in yeast and identify four structural groups in the nucleosome that influence lifespan. We also identify residues where substitution with an epigenetic mimic extends lifespan, providing evidence that a simple epigenetic switch, without possible additional background modifications, causes longevity. Residues where substitution result in the most pronounced lifespan extension are all on the exposed face of the nucleosome, with the exception of H3E50, which is present on the lateral surface, between two DNA gyres. Other residues that have a more modest effect on lifespan extension are concentrated at the extremities of the H3-H4 dimer, suggesting a role in stabilizing the dimer in its nucleosome frame. Residues that reduce lifespan are buried in the histone handshake motif, suggesting that these mutations destabilize the octamer structure. All residues exposed on the nucleosome disk face and that cause lifespan extension are known to interact with Sir3. We find that substitution of H4K16 and H4H18 cause Sir3 to redistribute from telomeres and silent mating loci to secondary positions, often enriched for Rap1, Abf1 or Reb1 binding sites, whereas H3E50 does not. The redistribution of Sir3 in the genome can be reproduced by an equilibrium model based on primary and secondary binding sites with different affinities for Sir3. The redistributed Sir3 cause transcriptional repression at most of the new loci, including of genes where null mutants were previously shown to extend chronological lifespan. The transcriptomic profiles of H4K16 and H4H18 mutant strains are very similar, and compatible with a DNA replication stress response. This is distinct from the transcriptomic profile of H3E50, which matches strong induction of oxidative phosphorylation. We propose that the different groups of residues are involved in binding to heterochromatin proteins, in destabilizing the association of the nucleosome DNA, disrupting binding of the H3-H4 dimer in the nucleosome, or disrupting the structural stability of the octamer, each category impacting on chronological lifespan by a different mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4281707649,"The potential impact of natural factors on the runoff of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) has been largely ignored in the Tarim Basin, China. A representative example is the Keriya River. To quantify the long-term dynamic variations in lower reach surface runoff of IRES, river length, defined as the distance between a selected fix point along the perennial river segment to its dynamic, ephemeral end, was used as an indicator. Using a total of 272 remote sensing images, we digitized and measured the distance (river length) between the center of Yutian County and the river's end point on each image, and then calculated monthly inter-annual and intra-annual variations in length of the lower Keriya River from 2000 to 2019. Hydrometeorological data were combined with descriptors of anthropogenic disturbances to assess the relative influence of natural factors and anthropogenic disturbances on lower reach river runoff. The results showed that intra-annual variations in river length fluctuated seasonally, with the minimum value occurring in June; two main peaks occurred in March and August. The minimum June value in river length was closely linked to an increase in agricultural water demand and a decrease in upper reach runoff. The August peak in river length was related to the peak values in upper reach runoff and agricultural water demand; upper reach runoff made a significant contribution because the former was about 20% more than the latter in summer. The March peak corresponded to elevated lower reach groundwater levels and to the melting of ice along river channels. Inter-annual variations in river length were due to inter-annual variations in upper reach runoff and middle reach agricultural water use which increased slightly during the study period. Inter-annual variations in frequency and amplitude of the fluctuations in river length were mainly controlled by changes in upper reach runoff. The minimum in river length in 2009 was consistent with the low in upper reach runoff of the Keriya River and other rivers in the Tarim Basin. The most significant factors controlling variations in river length are natural in origin."
https://openalex.org/W4281746712,"A mild traumatic brain injury is a neurological dysfunction caused by biomechanical forces transmitted to the brain in physical impacts. The current understanding of the neuropathological cascade resulting in the manifested clinical signs and symptoms is limited due to the absence of sensitive brain imaging methods. Zebrafish are established models for the reproduction and study of neurobiological pathologies. However, all available models mostly recreate moderate-to-severe focal injuries in adult zebrafish. The present work has induced a mild brain trauma in larval zebrafish through a non-invasive biomechanical approach. A custom-made apparatus with a commercially available motor was employed to expose larvae to rapidly decelerating linear movements. The neurophysiological changes following concussion were assessed through behavioural quantifications of startle reflex locomotor distance and habituation metrics. Here we show that the injury was followed, within five minutes, by a transient anxiety state and CNS dysfunction manifested by increased startle responsivity with impaired startle habituation, putatively mirroring the human clinical sign of hypersensitivity to noise. Within a day after the injury, chronic effects arose, as evidenced by an overall reduced responsivity to sensory stimulation (lower amplitude and distance travelled along successive stimuli), reflecting the human post-concussive symptomatology. This study represents a step forward towards the establishment of a parsimonious (simple, less ethically concerning, yet sensitive) animal model of mild TBI. Our behavioural findings mimic aspects of acute and chronic effects of human concussion, which warrant further study at molecular, cellular and circuit levels. While our model opens wide avenues for studying the underlying cellular and molecular pathomechanisms, it also enables high-throughput testing of therapeutic interventions to accelerate post-concussive recovery."
https://openalex.org/W4281754312,"Background Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) follow individual strategies to cope with this highly heterogeneous disease. As surveys show, lifestyle habits play an important role in pwMS. However, little is known about individual experiences of pwMS with different lifestyle adjustment strategies. Objective This study aims to describe and understand individual experiences of pwMS with lifestyle adjustments. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 50 pwMS in Germany. Criteria for inclusion were age ≥ 18 years and a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis. Data were analyzed inductively and deductively according to a six-step thematic analysis. Results The three main themes for experience-based lifestyle adjustments were: 1) nutrition and supplements, 2) exercise and physical activity, and 3) stress management. Influencing factors on the decision-making process such as active disease management, information and advice, desire for mental health and social support, and the wish for self-determination were identified. Impacts of starting or maintaining lifestyle habits included, for example, MS-specific, general, and mental health benefits, the development of coping strategies, social support, and barriers that led to a termination of lifestyle adjustments. Conclusion This study provides a rich and nuanced amount of experiences of pwMS with lifestyle adjustments and leads to three important conclusions: 1) Further research is warranted to better describe the perceived effects of lifestyle habits on MS symptoms and progression, in particular with regard to nutrition and stress reduction; 2) patient education in MS should include the available evidence on lifestyle management and 3) patients need to be actively supported in changing their lifestyle behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4281776799,"Interprofessional identity development is an emerging area of research. Whilst there is a growing body of studies exploring interprofessional identity development and interprofessional education, little is known about interprofessional identity development in healthcare professionals and the impact of interprofessional identity on practice. This study explored interprofessional identity development in graduates during their first year of work as health professionals and the influence of this on practice. All graduates had prior interprofessional education as students. Fourteen interviews with eight graduates were conducted. Data was analysed cross-sectionally using inductive thematic analysis. Three inter-related themes were developed: 'growing confidence,' 'commitment to client-centred care,' and 'maintaining dual identification in different contexts.' These themes demonstrated that, first, interprofessional identity development occurred along a continuum influenced by the practice context and the individual's commitment to client-centred care. Second, confidence identifying and practising as a healthcare professional facilitates further interprofessional identity development. Third, maintaining identification as an interprofessional practitioner involves developing an increasingly sophisticated understanding of interprofessional practice by viewing interprofessional identity through increasingly complex meaning-making lenses consistent with the constructive developmental theory of self. Findings support the inclusion of pre-licensure interprofessional education and inform further interprofessional identity research in professionals beyond their first year of practice."

https://openalex.org/W4281800273,"Heart rate recovery in 1 minute (HRR1) after the end of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a non-invasive method of determining autonomic dysfunction. This parameter remains largely unexplored in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) registries. We aimed to define the cut-off value and accuracy for abnormal HRR1 after the 6MWT and to investigate the association between HRR1 and clinical worsening in patients with PAH. This composite outcome was defined as first occurrence of all-cause death OR hospitalization from any cause OR disease progression characterized by decreased ≥ 15% in six-minute walking distance from baseline AND start of new specific PAH treatment or persistent worsening of World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC). We performed a prospective cohort study that included 102 consecutive patients with PAH confirmed by right heart catheterization that underwent an 6MWT upon the diagnosis, recruited from September 2004 to April 2020 and followed up until April 2021 or death. The median HRR1 was 18 beats (IQR: 10-22), 50 and 52 PAH patients with <18 beats and ≥18 beats, respectively. The best cut-off for HRR1 to discriminate clinical worsening was 17 beats, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.704 (95%CI: 0.584-0.824). The internal validation model by bootstrap showed an AUC of 0.676 (95%CI: 0.566-0.786) and the most accurate value was obtained in the seventh year of follow-up (AUC = 0.711; 95%CI: 0.596-0.844). Patients with an HRR1 <18 beats at baseline had a median event-free time of 2.17 years (95%CI: 1.82 to 2.52) versus 4.75 years (95%CI: 1.43 to 8.07) from those with ≥18 beats. In conclusion, a HRR1 value of less than 18 beats may be a reliable indicator of poor prognosis in patients with PAH."
https://openalex.org/W4282014401,"Introduction Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) likely pose fewer health risks than smoking. Yet ENDS uptake has increased among never-smoking young adults, who likely face greater health risks relative to non-users of ENDS. To date, few qualitative studies have explored ENDS uptake and use by never-smokers. Methods We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 16 current ENDS users from New Zealand aged 18 to 24 years old who reported never having smoked cigarettes regularly. We explored participants’ experimentation with conventional tobacco products, trial, uptake and patterns of ENDS use, and their future intentions regarding both ENDS and conventional tobacco products. We managed the data using NVivo12 and used thematic analysis to interpret the transcripts. Results ENDS use enhanced connection and belonging by providing communal experiences and facilitating social interactions. Participants’ mastery of tricks generated social cachet within friendship groups and counteracted the ENDS-related stigma they experienced. Flavours, clouds and devices’ physical attributes provided stimulation and engagement , and some used ENDS for stress or appetite management . Lastly, participants rationalised ENDS uptake by referencing the far greater risks smoking posed. Conclusions ENDS uptake by young adult never-smokers is driven by both psycho-social and functional factors. ENDS provided shared hedonic experiences and physical pleasures, and generated both bonding and bridging social capital, although many participants had also experienced judgement from others for using ENDS. Policies that denormalise ENDS as recreational devices could discourage uptake by never-smokers, though measures will require careful nuancing to avoid deterring smokers from switching to ENDS."
https://openalex.org/W4281685869,"Background In infants, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection occasionally causes severe symptoms requiring respiratory support; however, supportive care is the primary treatment. This study compared the use of respiratory support among infants with RSV infection treated with or without pranlukast. Methods This retrospective cohort study included infants aged &lt;10 months with RSV infection who were admitted to three secondary level hospitals in Japan between 2012 and 2019. The infants were divided into two groups depending on whether they were treated with pranlukast. The primary outcome was the receiving respiratory support (high-flow nasal cannula, nasal continuous positive airway pressure, or ventilator). The secondary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, and the Global Respiratory Severity Score (GRSS) on starting respiratory support or at the time of the worst signs during hospitalization. We performed a propensity score-matched analysis. Results A total of 492 infants, including 147 propensity score-matched pairs, were included in the analysis. The use of respiratory support was significantly lower in infants treated with pranlukast (3.4% [5/147]) than those treated without pranlukast (11.6% [17/147]; P = 0.01). In the propensity score-matched analysis, pranlukast use was associated with a significantly lower chance of needing respiratory support (odds ratio: 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.08–0.79; P = 0.01); however, the length of hospital stay (median: 4 days) and the GRSS (median: 2.804 and 2.869 for infants treated with and without pranlukast, respectively) did not differ significantly between propensity score-matched pairs. Conclusions Pranlukast use was associated with a reduced likelihood of requiring respiratory support in infants aged &lt;10 months with RSV infection."
https://openalex.org/W4281707560,"It was previously observed that maternal iron supplementation in pregnancy was associated with increased offspring size and adiposity at birth, possibly mediated through increased risk of gestational diabetes. In this study we investigated potential long-term associations of maternal iron supplementation in pregnancy with offspring growth in infancy, and growth and cardiometabolic risk factors in mid-childhood to seek evidence of nutritional programming. Using a nested case-control format, markers of growth and adiposity were measured at 3, 12 and 24 months of age in 341 infants from the Cambridge Baby Growth Study whose mothers supplemented with iron in pregnancy and 222 infants whose mothers did not. Measures of growth, glucose tolerance (using a 30 minute 1.75 g glucose/kg body weight oral glucose tolerance test), insulin sensitivity (HOMA IR) and blood pressure were collected in 122 and 79 of these children, respectively, at around 9.5 years of age. In infancy adiposity-promoting associations with maternal iron supplementation in pregnancy were evident at 3 months of age (e.g. mean difference in skinfold thickness: β = +0.15 mm, p = 0.02, in n = 341 whose mothers supplemented versus 222 that did not; waist circumference: β = +0.7 cm, p = 0.04, in n = 159 and 78, respectively) but differences lessened after this time (e.g. 3–12 month change in mean difference in skinfold thickness: β = -0.2 mm, p = 0.03, in n = 272 and 178, respectively). At ~9.5 years of age children whose mothers supplemented with iron in pregnancy had lower mean arterial blood pressures (β = -1.0 mmHg, p = 0.03, in n = 119 and 78, respectively). There were no apparent differences in markers of growth or other cardiometabolic factors. These results suggest that most of the associations of maternal iron supplementation in pregnancy on growth and adiposity evident at birth disappear during infancy, but there may be some evidence of long-term nutritional programming of blood pressure in mid-childhood."

This study was motivated by the concerns about the impacts of high level of anthropogenic activities on Chaojing Park (gazetted as Wanghaixiang’s Chao-Jing Bay Resource Conservation Area (WCJBRA) in 2016). The present study provides baseline knowledge of free-living marine nematode community structure in WCJBRA and identify potential marine nematodes as bioindicators to indicate possible impacts of the anthropogenic activities to the Chaojing Park. A total of 15 stations were selected in the subtidal zones of WCJBRA and its adjacent area. Marine nematode sample collection was carried out on the 13th and 14th of September 2019 using SCUBA diving technique. Results showed positive correlation between nematode density and medium sand (500μm-1.0mm). Presence of certain species such as Daptonema sp., Pomponema sp. and Innocuonema sp. indicates presence of disturbances in S12 and S13. Several species also showed potential to be introduced as indicator for healthy environment subjected to further studies on nematode-pollutants relationship, particularly on autecology as per se. Higher species diversity, H’ index of S1-S8 and S11 was categorised as Good Condition; followed by station with moderate species diversity index (S9, S10, S14 –Moderate Condition) zone; and lastly S12, S13 and S15 (Poor Condition)."
https://openalex.org/W4281786459,"Background This study examined current breast cancer (BC) screening practices among Vietnamese women and the factors associated with the uptake of clinical breast examination (CBE). Methods A total of 508 women aged 30–74 years in Hanoi completed a knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) survey in 2019 including validated measures of breast cancer awareness (Breast-CAM) and health beliefs (Champion’s Health Belief Model Scale). Descriptive statistics, χ2, and ANOVA tests were used to analyse KAP responses across groups with different sociodemographic characteristics. A logistic regression model assessed the associations of knowledge, beliefs, and sociodemographic characteristics with CBE uptake. Results Only 18% of respondents were aware of BC signs, risk factors, and screening modalities although 63% had previously received BC screening. CBE was the most common screening modality with an uptake of 51%. A significantly higher proportion of urban residents compared with rural residents (32% vs 18%, Chi-square test, p = 0.04) received mammography. Unlike mammography, CBE uptake was not associated with sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., residence area/education level/occupation/household monthly income/possession of health insurance). CBE uptake was associated with BC knowledge (OR = 2.44, 95%CI: 1.37–4.32), perceived susceptibility to BC (OR = 1.15, 95%CI: 1.05–1.25), and perceived barriers to accessing CBE (OR = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.84–0.92). Conclusion The study points to the need for public health education and promotion interventions to address low levels of awareness about BC and to increase uptake of BC screening in Vietnam in advance of screening programme planning and implementation. It also suggests that screening programmes using CBE are promising given current engagement and the absence of socio-demographic disparities."
https://openalex.org/W4281851800,"This article proposes a novel dynamic objective function in a multi-period home health care (HHC) problem, known as the nurse-patient relationship (NPR). The nurse-patient relationship score indicating the trust a patient has for his or her care worker increases when the same people meet regularly and decreases when they are apart. Managing human resources in HHC is a combination of routing and scheduling problems. Due to computational complexity of the HHC problem, a 28-day home health care problem is decomposed into daily subproblems, and solved sequentially with the tabu search. The solutions are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. For problems with less complex constraints, the NPR model can also be solved using exact methods such as CPLEX. For larger scale instances, however, the numerical results show that the NPR model can only be solved in reasonable times using our proposed tabu search approach. The solutions obtained from the NPR models are compared against those from existing models in the literature such as preference and continuity of care. Essentially, the analysis revealed that the proposed NPR models encouraged the search algorithm to assign the same care worker to visit the same patient. In addition, it had a tendency to assign a care worker on consecutive days to each patient, which is one of the key factors in promoting trust between patients and care workers. This leads to the efficacy of monitoring patient's disease progression and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4281929192,"Introduction ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) is a perioperative program combining multiple evidence-based interventions designed to reduce the surgical stress response. Despite the publication of dedicated guidelines, ERAS application to gynecologic surgery outside clinical studies has been slow and fragmented. To promote the systematic adoption of the ERAS program in the entire regional hospital network in Piedmont an Audit-and-Feedback approach (A&amp;F) has been adopted within a cluster randomized controlled trial, aiming to estimate the true impact of the protocol on a large, unselected population. Methods The study protocol provides for a multicenter stepped wedge cluster randomized trial, focused on women undergoing an hysterectomy, for comparison between standard perioperative management and perioperative management according to the ERAS protocol. The primary outcome is the length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes are: post-operative complications, quality-of-recovery at 24-hours after surgery, 30-day readmissions, patients’ satisfaction, healthcare costs. The compliance to all the ERAS items is monitored with an A&amp;F approach. All the gynecologic units of Piedmont hospitals are involved and all the patients hospitalized for elective hysterectomy in the period of the study are included. Centers, stratified by surgical volume and randomly assigned to four groups, are randomly ordered to activate the ERAS protocol in four periods, every three months. The planned calendar and the total duration of the study have been extended for six months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The expected sample size of about 2400 patients has a high statistical power (99%) to detect a reduction of LOS of 1 day (effect size 0.5) and to estimate clinically meaningful changes in the other study endpoints. The study protocol has been approved by the Ethical Committee of all participating centers. Study results will be timely circulated within the hospital network and published in peer-reviewed journals. Conclusion Results are expected to demonstrate positive clinical outcomes of the ERAS protocol even when its implementation is directed towards an entire regional network of gynecologic units, and not only towards selected and highly motivated centers.

https://openalex.org/W4281939556,"In March 2020, WHO announced the COVID-19 a pandemic and a major global public health emergency. Mortality from COVID-19 is rapidly increasing globally, with acute respiratory failure as the predominant cause of death. Many patients experience severe hypoxia and life-threatening respiratory failure often requiring mechanical ventilation. To increase safety margins during emergency anaesthesia and rapid sequence intubation (RSI), patients are preoxygenated with a closed facemask with high-flow oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Due to the high shunt fraction of deoxygenated blood through the lungs frequently described in COVID-19 however, these measures may be insufficient to avoid harmful hypoxemia. Preoxygenation with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) potentially reduces the shunt fraction and may thus allow for the necessary margins of safety during RSI.The INOCOV protocol describes a phase II pharmacological trial of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) as an adjunct to standard of care with medical oxygen in initial airway and ventilation management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 in acute respiratory failure. The trial is parallel two-arm, randomized, controlled, blinded trial. The primary outcome measure is the change in oxygen saturation (SpO2), and the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the change in SpO2 following initiation of iNO.EudraCT number 2020-001656-18; WHO UTN: U1111-1250-1698.

https://openalex.org/W4282016203,"As dairy cows are being housed for longer periods, with all-year-round housing growing in popularity, it is important to ensure housed environments are meeting the needs of cows. Dairy cows are motivated to access open lying areas, although previous motivation studies on this topic have confounded surface type and location (i.e. pasture outdoors vs cubicles indoors). This study measured cow motivation for lying down on an indoor open mattress (MAT; 9 m x 5 m) compared to indoor mattress-bedded cubicles, thus removing the confounding factor of surface type and location. This was repeated for an identically sized indoor deep-bedded straw yard (ST), to investigate whether surface type affected motivation for an open lying area. Thirty Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were housed in groups of 5 (n = 5 x 6) in an indoor robotic milking unit with access to six mattress-bedded cubicles. To assess motivation, cows were required to walk increasing distances via a one-way indoor raceway to access the open lying areas: Short (34.5 m), followed by Medium (80.5 m) and Long (126.5 m). Cows could choose to walk the raceway, leading to the MAT or ST, to lie down or they could lie down on the cubicles for ‘free’. Overall, cows lay down for longer on the open lying areas at each distance compared to the cubicles, with cows lying down slightly longer on ST than MAT, although lying times on the open lying areas did decrease at the Long distance. However, cows were still lying for &gt;60% of their lying time on the open lying areas at the Long distance. This study demonstrates that cows had a high motivation for an open lying area, the provision of which could better cater for the behavioural needs of housed dairy cows and improve housed dairy cow welfare."

The spherical and elliptical (planoconvex and planoconcave) MLAs were incorporated on the outer face of the substrate layer to increase the EQE of the OLEDs. The maximum EQE of 17.30% was obtained for Convex-1 (elliptical planoconvex) MLA engraved OLED where the ERI was 1.70. In addition, Convex-1 MLA engraved OLED showed an improvement of 3.8 times on the peak electroluminescence (EL) light intensity compared to basic OLED. Therefore, Convex-1 MLA incorporated OLED can be considered as a potential white OLED because of its excellent light distribution and intensity profile."

Yet, African-American/Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Native Americans, and women are severely underrepresented in computational biosciences. We established the UCLA Bruins-in-Genomics Summer Research Program to provide training and research experiences in quantitative biology and bioinformatics to undergraduate students with an emphasis on students from backgrounds underrepresented in computational biology. Program assessment was based on number of applicants, alumni surveys and comparison of post-graduate educational choices for participants and a control group of students who were accepted but declined to participate. We hypothesized that participation in the Bruins-in-Genomics program would increase the likelihood that students would pursue post-graduate education in a related field. Our surveys revealed that 75% of Bruins-in-Genomics Summer participants were enrolled in graduate school. Logistic regression analysis revealed that women who participated in the program were significantly more likely to pursue a Ph.D. than a matched control group (group x woman interaction term of p = 0.005). The Bruins-in-Genomics Summer program represents an example of how a combined didactic-research program structure can make computational biology accessible to a wide range of undergraduates and increase participation in quantitative biosciences."

The relative impact of individual patient attributes on total medical cost among patients with rrDLBCL receiving second or third line (2L/3L) therapy was assessed. Structural equation modelling was used to identify potential cost drivers of total medical costs incurred by treatment and procedures in a Japanese retrospective claims database. From the database, rrDLBCL patients on 2L or 3L of treatment were grouped into respective cohorts. The mean [median] (SD) total medical cost of care for the 2L cohort was 73,296.40 [58,223.11] (58,409.79) US dollars (USD) and 75,238.35 [60,477.31] (59,583.66) USD for the 3L cohort.

A total of 72 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were found. Three SNPs (CG615, AT641 and AG3859) were significantly correlated with α -pinene content, with a contribution rate > 10%. These SNPs were used to select P. elliottii with high α-pinene content, and a 118.0% realistic gain was obtained.The PeTPS-(-)Apin gene is not uniquely decisive for selection of plus slash pines with stable production, high yield, and good quality, but it can be used as a reference for selection of other resin-producing pines and other resin components."
https://openalex.org/W4281763741,"Bayesian empirical likelihood (BEL) models are becoming increasingly popular as an attractive alternative to fully parametric models. However, they have only recently been applied to spatial data analysis for small area estimation. This study considers the development of spatial BEL models using two popular conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors, namely BYM and Leroux priors. The performance of the proposed models is compared with their parametric counterparts and with existing spatial BEL models using independent Gaussian priors and generalised Moran basis priors. The models are applied to two benchmark spatial datasets, simulation study and COVID-19 data. The results indicate promising opportunities for these models to capture new insights into spatial data. Specifically, the spatial BEL models outperform the parametric spatial models when the underlying distributional assumptions of data appear to be violated."

https://openalex.org/W4281782840,"Background In 2019, Zambia introduced the national health insurance (NHI) as a healthcare financing strategy to increase universal access to health care services. The private health sector can complement public sector providers as service providers under the NHI. As such, the NHI Management Authority seeks to accredit for-profit private healthcare facilities in the NHI. Ascertaining factors that influence private-for-profit health providers to participate in the NHI is essential, but the evidence is lacking. In this study, we aimed to explore and characterize perceptions and experiences of for-profit private hospitals, dental clinics, eye clinics, diagnostic centres, and pharmacies regarding their inclusion in the NHI. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews with owners or management officers of purposively sampled private health care providers in Lusaka, Zambia (n = 22) between May and June 2020. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse data. Results The findings highlight low awareness of the NHI among providers and a need to understand the NHI. Providers revealed their positions and views on the accreditation process and payment arrangements and stated that their participation would complement the NHI. They also cited conditions to participate in the NHI, highlighted opportunities and challenges of engaging in the NHI, and expressed a need for sustainable ways of governing the scheme. Conclusion The assessment of health providers’ inclusion in the NHI scheme is multifaceted. The results of this study surfaced factors such as raising awareness on the NHI among providers and how their concerns on aspects such as payments can be considered as inputs to enlighten consensual agreements between the NHI authority and health providers in leveraging the private health sector. Private providers’ concerns must be further understood and considered as the NHI strives to include this group as health care providers in the scheme."

https://openalex.org/W4281964713,"Stereotype threat has been proposed as one cause of gender differences in post-compulsory mathematics participation. Danaher and Crandall argued, based on a study conducted by Stricker and Ward, that enquiring about a student's gender after they had finished a test, rather than before, would reduce stereotype threat and therefore increase the attainment of women students. Making such a change, they argued, could lead to nearly 5000 more women receiving AP Calculus AB credit per year. We conducted a preregistered conceptual replication of Stricker and Ward's study in the context of the UK Mathematics Trust's Junior Mathematical Challenge, finding no evidence of this stereotype threat effect. We conclude that the 'silver bullet' intervention of relocating demographic questions on test answer sheets is unlikely to provide an effective solution to systemic gender inequalities in mathematics education."
https://openalex.org/W4282047788,"Mutations in the Kelch-like 3 (KLHL3) gene are the most common cause of inherited pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII) featuring thiazide-sensitive hypertension and hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis. Although Klhl3R528H/+ knock-in (KI) mice carrying a missense mutation in the Kelch repeat domain have been reported, nonsense KLHL3 mutations in the same domain that cause PHAII have not been fully investigated in vivo. We generated and analyzed Klhl3 KI mice harboring a nonsense W523X mutation (corresponding to the human KLHL3 W470X mutation). Both heterozygous and homozygous Klhl3W523X/+ KI mice exhibited typical PHAII with low-renin hypertension, hyperkalemia with reduced renal potassium excretion, and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Their kidney tissues showed the presence of Klhl3 mRNA and increased Klhl3 protein levels along with enhanced downstream Wnk1/4-Spak/Osr1-N(k)cc phosphorylation. Increased protein expression of total Spak, phosphor(p-)Spak, total Ncc, and p-Ncc from urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) also confirmed the activation of the Wnk-mediated Ncc pathway. In vitro studies showed that the human KLHL3 W470X mutation resulted in increased KLHL3 protein stability and disrupted its binding affinity for WNK1/4, leading to the attenuated degradation and increased abundance of total WNKs. In conclusion, nonsense Klhl3W523X/+ mice recapitulating PHAII phenotypes exhibit Klhl3 protein stability, abrogating its binding to Wnks, with enhanced Ncc expression in the kidney tissue and even in uEVs. Activation of the WNK-mediated Na+ -Cl- co-transporter reiterated the in vivo pathogenic role of nonsense KLHL3 mutations in PHAII."
