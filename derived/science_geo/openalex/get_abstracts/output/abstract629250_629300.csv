This research aimed at expanding the knowledge of the role played by AMF in the uptake of macro- and micronutrients and N transfer (using a 15N stem-labelling method) in a faba bean/wheat intercropping system. It also investigates the role of AMF in biological N fixation (using the natural isotopic abundance method) in faba bean grown in pure stand and in mixture. Finally, it examines the role of AMF in driving competition and facilitation between faba bean and wheat. Durum wheat and faba bean were grown in pots (five pots per treatment) as sole crops or in mixture in the presence or absence of AMF. Root colonisation by AMF was greater in faba bean than in wheat and increased when species were mixed compared to pure stand (particularly for faba bean). Mycorrhizal symbiosis positively influenced root biomass, specific root length, and root density and increased the uptake of P, Fe, and Zn in wheat (both in pure stand and in mixture) but not in faba bean. Furthermore, AMF symbiosis increased the percentage of N derived from the atmosphere in the total N biomass of faba bean grown in mixture (+20%) but not in pure stand. Nitrogen transfer from faba bean to wheat was low (2.5-3.0 mg pot-1); inoculation with AMF increased N transfer by 20%. Overall, in terms of above- and belowground growth and uptake of nutrients, mycorrhization favoured the stronger competitor in the mixture (wheat) without negatively affecting the companion species (faba bean). Results of this study confirm the role of AMF in driving biological interactions among neighbouring plants."

https://openalex.org/W2921331759,"The biofilm-forming ability of Burkholderia pseudomallei is crucial for its survival in unsuitable environments and is correlated with antibiotic resistance and relapsing cases of melioidosis. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is an essential component for biofilm development and maturation in many bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the eDNA released by B. pseudomallei during biofilm formation using DNase treatment. The extent of biofilm formation and quantity of eDNA were assessed by crystal-violet staining and fluorescent dye-based quantification, respectively, and visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Variation in B. pseudomallei biofilm formation and eDNA quantity was demonstrated among isolates. CLSM images of biofilms stained with FITC-ConA (biofilm) and TOTO-3 (eDNA) revealed the localization of eDNA in the biofilm matrix. A positive correlation of biofilm biomass with quantity of eDNA during the 2-day biofilm-formation observation period was found. The increasing eDNA quantity over time, despite constant living/dead ratios of bacterial cells during the experiment suggests that eDNA is delivered from living bacterial cells. CLSM images demonstrated that depletion of eDNA by DNase I significantly lessened bacterial attachment (if DNase added at 0 h) and biofilm developing stages (if added at 24 h) but had no effect on mature biofilm (if added at 45 h). Collectively, our results reveal that eDNA is released from living B. pseudomallei and is correlated with biofilm formation. It was also apparent that eDNA is essential during bacterial cell attachment and biofilm-forming steps. The depletion of eDNA by DNase may provide an option for the prevention or dispersal of B. pseudomallei biofilm."

https://openalex.org/W2921980535,"Primary and secondary traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause tissue damage by inducing cell death pathways including apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy. However, similar pathways can also lead to senescence. Senescent cells secrete senescence-associated secretory phenotype proteins following persistent DNA damage response signaling, leading to cell disorders. TBI initially activates the cell cycle followed by the subsequent triggering of senescence. This study aims to clarify how the mRNA and protein expression of different markers of cell cycle and senescence are modulated and switched over time after TBI. We performed senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, immunohistochemical analysis, and real-time PCR to examine the time-dependent changes in expression levels of proteins and mRNA, related to cell cycle and cellular senescence markers, in the cerebrum during the initial 14 days after TBI using a mouse model of controlled cortical impact (CCI). Within the area adjacent to the cerebral contusion after TBI, the protein and/or mRNA expression levels of cell cycle markers were increased significantly until 4 days after injury and senescence markers were significantly increased at 4, 7, and 14 days after injury. Our findings suggested that TBI initially activated the cell cycle in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia within the area adjacent to the hemicerebrum contusion in TBI, whereas after 4 days, such cells could undergo senescence in a cell-type-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2921657420,"Health management information system (HMIS) data are important for guiding the attainment of health targets in low- and middle-income countries. However, the quality of HMIS data is often poor. High-quality information is especially important for populations experiencing high burdens of disease and mortality, such as pregnant women, newborns, and children. The purpose of this study was to assess the quality of maternal and child health (MCH) data collected through the Ethiopian Ministry of Health’s HMIS in three districts of Jimma Zone, Oromiya Region, Ethiopia over a 12-month period from July 2014 to June 2015. Considering data quality constructs from the World Health Organization’s data quality report card, we appraised the completeness, timeliness, and internal consistency of eight key MCH indicators collected for all the primary health care units (PHCUs) located within three districts of Jimma Zone (Gomma, Kersa and Seka Chekorsa). We further evaluated the agreement between MCH service coverage estimates from the HMIS and estimates obtained from a population-based cross-sectional survey conducted with 3,784 women who were pregnant in the year preceding the survey, using Pearson correlation coefficients, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots. We found that the completeness and timeliness of facility reporting were highest in Gomma (75% and 70%, respectively) and lowest in Kersa (34% and 32%, respectively), and observed very few zero/missing values and moderate/extreme outliers for each MCH indicator. We found that the reporting of MCH indicators improved over time for all PHCUs, however the internal consistency between MCH indicators was low for several PHCUs. We found poor agreement between MCH estimates obtained from the HMIS and the survey, indicating that the HMIS may over-report the coverage of key MCH services, namely, antenatal care, skilled birth attendance and postnatal care. The quality of MCH data within the HMIS at the zonal level in Jimma, Ethiopia, could be improved to inform MCH research and programmatic efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2922149309,"Introduction Although the coverage of maternity services in some low and middle-income countries (LMIC) has greatly improved, the quality of maternity care remains poor, and maternal mortality rates are high. In this study, we describe the meaning and determinants of maternity care quality from the perspective of health workers and mothers in Uganda, the informal solutions used by health workers to manage their daily challenges, and we suggest ways in which maternal care quality can be improved. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in the Mpigi and Rukungiri districts of Uganda. Twenty-eight health workers based at selected health centres participated in structured interviews. Thirty-six mothers, half of whom had delivered at health facilities, participated in focus group discussions. Data were analysed thematically, and informed by the WHO framework on quality of care for maternal and newborn health and by Lipsky’s street level bureaucracy concept. Results According to health workers, knowledge of clinical standards and processes, timeliness, and women’s choice during labour, as well as resources, physical infrastructure; collaboration with mothers, professionals and community health workers; were important aspects of good quality care. Mothers’ perceptions of good quality care were largely similar to health workers’ views, though mothers were more concerned about health workers’ interaction skills. Structural challenges sometimes led health workers to develop informal solutions such as asking mothers to purchase their own supplies with variable implications on the quality of care. While several of these informal solutions were useful in addressing bottlenecks in the health system, they sometimes placed additional burdens and personal costs on health workers, created mistrust, inequity in care and negative experiences among mothers who could not afford the extra costs. Conclusions Health system structural factors; including technical, interpersonal, resource and infrastructural factors; impede the provision and experience of good quality maternity care at health centres in Uganda. Improving the quality of care will require strategies that address these core problems in the health system structure. Such structural reforms will require political support to commit resources, skilful management and leadership that seek to change organisational behaviour and build trust through good quality, woman-centred maternity care."

A cohort of 106 periodontitis patients classified by stages of severity and 85 healthy adult control patients was constituted. An efficient culture protocol, a new identification tool by real-time qPCR of T. tenax and a Multi-Locus Sequence Typing system (MLST) based on T. tenax NIH4 reference strain were created. Fifty-three strains of Trichomonas sp. were obtained from periodontal samples. 37/106 (34.90%) T. tenax from patients with periodontitis and 16/85 (18.80%°) T. tenax from control patients were detected by culture (p = 0.018). Sixty of the 191 samples were tested positive for T. tenax by qPCR, 24/85 (28%) controls and 36/106 (34%) periodontitis patients (p = 0.089). By combining both results, 45/106 (42.5%) patients were positive by culture and/or PCR, as compared to 24/85 (28.2%) controls (p = 0.042). A link was established between the carriage in patients of Trichomonas tenax and the severity of the disease. Genotyping demonstrates the presence of strain diversity with three major different clusters and a relation between disease strains and the periodontitis severity (p<0.05). More frequently detected in periodontal cases, T. tenax is likely to be related to the onset or/and evolution of periodontal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2920978712,"Social hierarchies are crucial for a group's survival and can influence the way an individual behaves and relates to a given social context. The study of social rank has been classically based on ethological and observational paradigms, but it recently has taken advantage of the use of other approaches, such as the tube test that measures territorial dominance without the display of in situ aggression and is executable in group-living animals. However, little is known about how previous basal individual differences affect the development of dominance hierarchy measured in the tube test. We have analyzed in male mice body weight, locomotion, anxiety, and serum corticosterone both before and after the tube test, as well as adult hippocampal neurogenesis and transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex after the hierarchy had been established. We found differential gene expression between dominants and subordinates but no association between the other parameters and social status, neither pre- nor posttest. Our findings reveal that social rank in mice is stable along time and is not related to basal differences in stress, mood, or physical features. Lastly, real-time quantitative PCR analysis confirmed differential expression of vomeronasal and olfactory receptors in the cerebral cortex between dominant and subordinate individuals, suggesting that differential brain gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex could potentially be used as a biomarker of social dominance.—Pallé, A., Zorzo, C., Luskey, V.

This study aimed to identify the sociodemographic factors associated with inadequate food group consumption and not meeting the minimum dietary diversity (MDD) among infants and young children aged 6-23 months in Nepal. Using cross-sectional data from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, the factors at the individual-, household-, and community-levels associated with not consuming foods from the seven food groups, which are grains, roots and tubers, legumes and nuts, dairy products, flesh foods, eggs, vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables, and other fruits and vegetables, and not meeting the MDD were examined. The least consumed food group was eggs, followed by flesh foods and 46.5% of children received the MDD. Children aged 6-11 months had higher odds of not consuming foods from the seven food groups and not meeting the MDD than older children. Children from the poorest quintile had higher odds of not consuming legumes and nuts, dairy products, flesh foods, and other fruits and vegetables, and not meeting the MDD. Children from Terai/Madhesi Other had higher odds of not consuming foods from the seven food groups compared to those from the other groups. Children from Province 2 had higher odds of not consuming eggs, vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables, and other fruits and vegetables, and not meeting the MDD. Dietary diversity among children in Nepal needs improvement. National policies and programs need to promote the consumption of diverse food groups by considering different sociodemographic characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2921494377,"Skeletal homeostasis is closely effectuated by the regulation of bone formation and bone resorption. Osteoclasts are multinuclear giant cells responsible for bone resorption. Overactivated osteoclasts and excessive bone resorption result in various lytic bone diseases, such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, periprosthetic infection, and inflammatory aseptic loosening of orthopedic implants. In consideration of the severe side effects caused by the currently available drugs, exploitation of novel drugs has gradually attracted attention. Because of its antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor capacities, diallyl disulfide (DADS), a major oil-soluble organosulfur ingredient compound derived from garlic, has been widely researched. However, the effects of DADS on osteoclasts and lytic bone diseases are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of DADS on receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)- and LPS-mediated osteoclastogenesis, LPS-stimulated proinflammatory cytokines related to osteoclasts, and LPS-induced inflammatory osteolysis. The results showed that DADS significantly inhibited RANKL-mediated osteoclast formation, fusion, and bone resorption in a dose-dependent manner via inhibiting the NF-κB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling and restraining the interaction of NF-κB p65 with nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1. Furthermore, DADS also markedly suppressed LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis and reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines with LPS stimulation to indirectly mediate osteoclast formation. Consistent with the in vitro results, DADS prevented the LPS-induced severe bone loss by blocking the osteoclastogenesis. All of the results indicate that DADS may be a potential and exploitable drug used for preventing and impeding osteolytic lesions.—Yang, J., Tang, R., Yi, J., Chen, Y., Li, X., Yu, T., Fei, J.

However, our understanding of molecular mechanisms that preferentially influence GABAergic transmission, particularly presynaptic mechanisms, remains limited. We previously reported that the ubiquitin ligase EEL-1 preferentially regulates GABAergic presynaptic transmission. To further explore how EEL-1 functions, here we performed affinity purification proteomics using Caenorhabditis elegans and identified the O-GlcNAc transferase OGT-1 as an EEL-1 binding protein. This observation was intriguing, as we know little about how OGT-1 affects neuron function. Using C. elegans biochemistry, we confirmed that the OGT-1/EEL-1 complex forms in neurons in vivo and showed that the human orthologs, OGT and HUWE1, also bind in cell culture. We observed that, like EEL-1, OGT-1 is expressed in GABAergic motor neurons, localizes to GABAergic presynaptic terminals, and functions cell-autonomously to regulate GABA neuron function. Results with catalytically inactive point mutants indicated that OGT-1 glycosyltransferase activity is dispensable for GABA neuron function. Consistent with OGT-1 and EEL-1 forming a complex, genetic results using automated, behavioral pharmacology assays showed that ogt-1 and eel-1 act in parallel to regulate GABA neuron function.

In OGT conditional knockout mice, AgRP (agouti-related protein) and PVN (paraventricular nucleus) neurons are functionally impaired, leading to impacts on fat metabolism and feeding behavior, respectively (32Ruan H.B.

While glycosyltransferase activity is the most widely studied OGT activity, a much smaller body of work indicates that OGT can also act as a scaffold protein (25Levine Z.G. Walker S. The biochemistry of O-GlcNAc transferase: which functions make it essential in mammalian cells?.Annu. Rev.

At present, it is unknown whether this transferase-independent function of OGT has a role in the nervous system. To explore the biological relationship between OGT-1 and EEL-1, we expanded upon our proteomic finding that OGT-1 was a putative EEL-1 binding protein with several independent experimental approaches. We biochemically validated the interaction between OGT-1 and EEL-1 and showed that it occurs in C. elegans neurons in vivo. Importantly, this interaction was conserved as it also occurred between HUWE1 and OGT, the orthologous human proteins. Similar to EEL-1, OGT-1 was broadly expressed in the nervous system, including the cholinergic and GABAergic neurons of the motor circuit, and localized to presynaptic terminals in GABA neurons. Results from genetic analysis using an automated behavioral assay and pharmacological manipulation of the motor circuit showed that OGT-1 affects GABA neuron function. Similar phenotypic defects in GABA neuron function were previously observed in eel-1 mutants (20Opperman K.J. Mulcahy B. Giles A.C. Risley M.G. Birnbaum R.L. Tulgren E.D. Dawson-Scully K. Zhen M. Grill B. The HECT family ubiquitin ligase EEL-1 regulates neuronal function and development.Cell Rep. 2017; 19 (28445732): 822-83510.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic results indicate that OGT-1 functions in parallel to EEL-1 in GABA neurons. Consistent with this, OGT-1 and EEL-1 also act in parallel to affect locomotion. Findings with point mutations that impair catalytic activity show that OGT-1 functions independently of glycosyltransferase activity to affect GABA neuron function, whereas EEL-1 ubiquitin ligase activity is required. Thus, our study reveals the discovery of an OGT-1/EEL-1 protein complex that regulates GABA neuron function and provides the first evidence of a nonenzymatic OGT-1 function in the nervous system. Previously, we used a combination of electrophysiology and behavioral pharmacology to show that EEL-1 regulates GABAergic presynaptic transmission (20Opperman K.J. Mulcahy B. Giles A.C. Risley M.G. Birnbaum R.L. Tulgren E.D. Dawson-Scully K. Zhen M. Grill B. The HECT family ubiquitin ligase EEL-1 regulates neuronal function and development.Cell Rep. 2017; 19 (28445732): 822-83510.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine how EEL-1 regulates GABA transmission, we wanted to use affinity purification proteomics to identify EEL-1 binding proteins. As the first step in this process, we developed an automated platform for evaluating motor circuit function using aldicarb pharmacology. Once established, this assay would allow us to rapidly and quantitatively evaluate whether EEL-1 reagents are functional in vivo and suitable for affinity purification proteomics. The C. elegans motor circuit is composed of excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic motor neurons that innervate body wall muscles to control contraction and relaxation, respectively (Fig. 1A). This balance of excitation and inhibition allows for coordinated sinusoidal movement of the body. A traditional pharmacological assay for assessing motor circuit function relies upon aldicarb, an inhibitor of acetylcholine esterase (AchE). 2The abbreviations used are: AchEacetylcholinesteraseAchacetylcholineIPimmunoprecipitationNMJneuromuscular junctionFDRfalse discovery rateLSDleast significant differenceANOVAanalysis of variance. By impairing AchE, aldicarb causes accumulation of Ach over time, which leads to excess muscle contraction and gradual paralysis (Fig. 1A). Traditionally, this is measured by assessing C. elegans paralysis while animals are on agar plates containing aldicarb. Aldicarb-induced paralysis on plates is usually assessed manually, but it has been automated (34Mahoney T.R. Luo S. Nonet M.L. Analysis of synaptic transmission in Caenorhabditis elegans using an aldicarb-sensitivity assay.Nat.

We developed an automated, liquid assay that uses MWT (Multi-Worm Tracker) to evaluate locomotion and aldicarb-induced paralysis (Fig. 1B). We simultaneously monitored 20 wells with 4 worms/well (Fig. 1B). We recorded 10 min of baseline movement, added a desired aldicarb dose, and recorded animal speed in response to drug. As expected, WT animals showed dose-dependent paralysis after aldicarb treatment (Fig. 1C). Compared with our experience with manual aldicarb assays on agar plates (20Opperman K.J. Mulcahy B.

Mutants that have disrupted motor circuit function have altered aldicarb sensitivity (17Vashlishan A.B. Madison J.M. Dybbs M. Bai J. Sieburth D. Ch'ng Q. Tavazoie M. Kaplan J.M. An RNAi screen identifies genes that regulate GABA synapses.Neuron. 2008; 58 (18466746): 346-36110.1016/j.neuron.2008.02.019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Mahoney T.R.

Mutants with impaired cholinergic function accumulate Ach more slowly at the synapse when treated with aldicarb, which results in slower paralysis and resistance to aldicarb compared with WT animals. This is also the case for mutants that affect cholinergic and GABAergic function equally. There are two scenarios that lead to aldicarb resistance. The first is mutants with increased cholinergic function. The second is mutants that have preferentially disrupted inhibitory GABA function, which results in loss of relaxation and faster paralysis in the presence of aldicarb (Fig. 1A). To assess the performance of our automated aldicarb assay, we tested several aldicarb hypersensitive mutants: hypersensitive mutants with increased cholinergic transmission (goa-1 and slo-1), mutants that are defective in GABA biosynthesis (unc-25), and mutants that lack a GABA receptor subunit (unc-49) (17Vashlishan A.B.

We also evaluated eel-1 (zu462) deletion mutants, which we previously showed are hypersensitive to aldicarb due to defects in GABAergic presynaptic transmission (20Opperman K.J. Mulcahy B. Giles A.C. Risley M.G. Birnbaum R.L. Tulgren E.D. Dawson-Scully K. Zhen M. Grill B. The HECT family ubiquitin ligase EEL-1 regulates neuronal function and development.Cell Rep. 2017; 19 (28445732): 822-83510.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Consistent with prior studies, these mutants were hypersensitive in automated aldicarb assays (Fig. 1D and Figs. S1 and S2A). Hypersensitivity in eel-1 mutants was rescued by an integrated transgene that expressed EEL-1 using the native eel-1 promoter (Fig. 1D and Fig. S2A). It is unclear why the EEL-1 transgene did not fully rescue. This could be because the eel-1 promoter we designed is not ideal for EEL-1 expression, or EEL-1 is not expressed at optimal levels by the integrated multicopy transgene we used. Nonetheless, these results indicate that we have developed an automated liquid aldicarb assay that rapidly and quantitatively assesses motor circuit function. This approach allowed us to assess aldicarb hypersensitivity and rescue in eel-1 mutants. Thus, this assay is suitable for functional evaluation of EEL-1 constructs used for proteomics. The next step toward EEL-1 affinity purification proteomics was to generate an eel-1 protein null allele and evaluate this mutant in automated aldicarb assays. A protein null allele is particularly important to ensure that transgenic EEL-1 used for affinity purification proteomics is not competing with endogenous EEL-1 protein or EEL-1 fragments. We generated bgg1, an eel-1 protein null, using Mos1-mediated deletion to eliminate the entire eel-1 coding sequence, including the HECT ubiquitin ligase domain (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, eel-1 (bgg1) mutants were hypersensitive to aldicarb (Fig. 2C), similar to eel-1 (zu462) mutants (Fig. 1D). Next, we used automated aldicarb assays to evaluate rescue for EEL-1 constructs tagged with affinity purification tags. Several transgenes were generated that fused different constructs to a GS (protein G and streptavidin-binding protein) tag. GS was fused to WT EEL-1 or EEL-1 point-mutated at a critical residue (C4144A) required for E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig. 2B) (37Zhao X. Heng J.I. Guardavaccaro D. Jiang R. Pagano M. Guillemot F. Iavarone A. Lasorella A. The HECT-domain ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 controls neural differentiation and proliferation by destabilizing the N-Myc oncoprotein.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10 (18488021): 643-65310.1038/ncb1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We refer to the catalytically inactive point mutant as EEL-1 LD (ligase-dead). GS-tagged GFP served as a negative control. All transgenes were driven by the native eel-1 promoter and expressed in the eel-1 (bgg1) protein null background. There were two reasons we included the EEL-1 LD transgene: 1) it remains unclear whether EEL-1 effects on aldicarb sensitivity and GABA transmission are mediated by EEL-1 ubiquitin ligase activity, and 2) we wanted to evaluate whether the EEL-1 LD can biochemically “trap” and enrich EEL-1 ubiquitination substrates in proteomic experiments. As shown in Fig. 2C, GS::EEL-1 significantly rescued aldicarb hypersensitivity of eel-1 (bgg1) mutants. Similar to untagged EEL-1 (Fig. 1D), GS::EEL-1 only partially rescued eel-1. In contrast, rescue was not observed with GS::EEL-1 LD or GS::GFP (Fig. 2C). Previous work showed that locomotion, the behavioral output of the motor circuit, is also impaired in eel-1 mutants (20Opperman K.J. Mulcahy B. Giles A.C. Risley M.G. Birnbaum R.L. Tulgren E.D. Dawson-Scully K. Zhen M. Grill B. The HECT family ubiquitin ligase EEL-1 regulates neuronal function and development.Cell Rep. 2017; 19 (28445732): 822-83510.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, eel-1 (bgg1) null mutants had defective baseline locomotion while swimming in liquid. Locomotion defects were partially rescued by GS::EEL-1, but not GS::EEL-1 LD or GS::GFP (Fig. S3). Taken together, these results support several conclusions. First, the eel-1 protein null allele, bgg1, is hypersensitive to aldicarb and impairs locomotion in liquid. Second, the GS::EEL-1 affinity purification reagent is functional and rescues eel-1 (bgg1). Finally, failure of GS::EEL-1 LD to rescue defects in eel-1 (bgg1) mutants indicates that EEL-1 ubiquitin ligase activity is required for motor circuit function and locomotion. Our strategy for EEL-1 affinity purification proteomics is portrayed in Fig. 2D. Transgenic animals expressing GS::EEL-1, GS::EEL-1 LD, or GS::GFP (negative control) on an eel-1 (bgg1) protein null background were grown in large-scale liquid culture, harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen animals were cryomilled in liquid nitrogen–cooled cylinders to obtain micron–scale grindates that facilitated rapid lysis and protein extraction. Whole worm lysates were applied to IgG-Dynabeads to affinity capture protein complexes containing GS-tagged target proteins. Sample quality was assessed and optimized using two parameters: 1) immunoblotting (1% of sample) to confirm GS-tagged target proteins were successfully purified (Fig. S4) and 2) silver staining (9% of sample) to evaluate sample purity and estimate the total amount of purified target (Fig. S4). Using this approach, affinity purification procedures were extensively optimized to obtain as much GS target as possible, while also ensuring that the GS::GFP negative control was as clean as possible compared with GS::EEL-1 and GS::EEL-1 LD test samples. The majority of each sample (90%) was run on SDS-PAGE and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, and peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 2D). The most prominent species present in all samples were the affinity purification targets, GS::EEL-1, GS::EEL-1 LD, or GS::GFP (Fig. 2,"

Mature neurons typically fail to regenerate after injury, partly because of mitochondrial motility and energy deficits in injured axons. Retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-β signaling is involved in axonal and neurite regeneration. Here we investigate the effect of RAR-β signaling on mitochondrial trafficking during neurite outgrowth and find that it enhances their proliferation, speed, and movement toward the growing end of the neuron via hypoxia-inducible factor 1α signaling. We also show that RAR-β signaling promotes the binding of the mitochondria to the anchoring protein, glucose-related protein 75, at the growing tip of neurite, thus allowing them to provide energy and metabolic roles required for neurite outgrowth.-Trigo, D., Goncalves, M.

Here, we examined the expression of 24 genes associated with stroma in fetal ovaries during gestation (n = 17; days 58–274) from Bos taurus cattle. RNA was isolated from ovaries for quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of the majority of genes in TGFβ signalling, stromal transcription factors (NR2F2, AR), and some stromal matrix genes (COL1A1, COL3A1 and FBN1, but not FBN3) showed a positive linear increase with gestational age. Expression of genes associated with follicles (INSL3, CYP17A1, CYP11A1 and HSD3B1), was low until mid-gestation and then increased with gestational age. LHCGR showed an unusual bimodal pattern; high levels in the first and last trimesters. RARRES1 and IGFBP3 also increased with gestational age. To relate changes in gene expression in stromal cells with that in non stromal cells during development of the ovary we combined the data on the stromal genes with another 20 genes from non stromal cells published previously and then performed hierarchical clustering analysis. Three major clusters were identified. Cluster 1 genes (GATA4, FBN3, LHCGR, CYP19A1, ESR2, OCT4, DSG2, TGFB1, CCND2, LGR5, NR5A1) were characterised by high expression only in the first trimester. Cluster 2 genes (FSHR, INSL3, HSD3B1, CYP11A1, CYP17A1, AMH, IGFBP3, INHBA) were highly expressed in the third trimester and largely associated with follicle function. Cluster 3 (COL1A1, COL3A1, FBN1, TGFB2 TGFB3, TGFBR2, TGFBR3, LTBP2, LTBP3, LTBP4, TGFB1I1, ALDH1A1, AR, ESR1, NR2F2) had much low expression in the first trimester rising in the second trimester and remaining at that level during the third trimester. Cluster 3 contained members of two pathways, androgen and TGFβ signalling, including a common member of both pathways namely the androgen receptor cofactor TGFβ1 induced transcript 1 protein (TGFB1I1; hic5). GATA4, FBN3 and LHCGR, were highly correlated with each other and were expressed highly in the first trimester during stromal expansion before follicle formation, suggesting that this could be a critical phase in the development of the ovarian stroma."
https://openalex.org/W2921496025,"Introduction Colorectal cancers (CRCs) deficient in the DNA mismatch repair protein MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) display distinct clinicopathological features and require a different therapeutic approach compared to CRCs with MLH1 proficiency. However, the molecular basis of this fundamental difference remains elusive. Here, we report that MLH1-deficient CRCs exhibit reduced levels of the cytoskeletal scaffolding protein non-erythroid spectrin αII (SPTAN1), and that tumor progression and metastasis of CRCs correlate with SPTAN1 levels. Methods and results To investigate the link between MLH1 and SPTAN1 in cancer progression, a cohort of 189 patients with CRC was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Compared with the surrounding normal mucosa, SPTAN1 expression was reduced in MLH1-deficient CRCs, whereas MLH1-proficient CRCs showed a significant upregulation of SPTAN1. Overall, we identified a strong correlation between MLH1 status and SPTAN1 expression. When comparing TNM classification and SPTAN1 levels, we found higher SPTAN1 levels in stage I CRCs, while stages II to IV showed a gradual reduction of SPTAN1 expression. In addition, SPTAN1 expression was lower in metastatic compared with non-metastatic CRCs. Knockdown of SPTAN1 in CRC cell lines demonstrated decreased cell viability, impaired cellular mobility and reduced cell-cell contact formation, indicating that SPTAN1 plays an important role in cell growth and cell attachment. The observed weakened cell-cell contact of SPTAN1 knockdown cells might indicate that tumor cells expressing low levels of SPTAN1 detach from their primary tumor and metastasize more easily. Conclusion Taken together, we demonstrate that MLH1 deficiency, low SPTAN1 expression, and tumor progression and metastasis are in close relation. We conclude that SPTAN1 is a candidate molecule explaining the tumor progression and metastasis of MLH1-deficient CRCs. The detailed analysis of SPTAN1 is now mandatory to substantiate its relevance and its potential value as a candidate protein for targeted therapy, and as a predictive marker of cancer aggressiveness."

https://openalex.org/W2922214195,"The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) are heterogeneous brainstem structures that contain cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic neurons. PPT/LDT neurons are suggested to modulate both cognitive and noncognitive functions, yet the extent to which acetylcholine (ACh) signaling from the PPT/LDT is necessary for normal behavior remains uncertain. We addressed this issue by using a mouse model in which PPT/LDT cholinergic signaling is highly decreased by selective deletion of the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT) gene. This approach interferes exclusively with ACh signaling, leaving signaling by other neurotransmitters from PPT/LDT cholinergic neurons intact and sparing other cells. VAChT mutants were examined on different PPT/LDT-associated cognitive domains. Interestingly, VAChT mutants showed no attentional deficits and only minor cognitive flexibility impairments while presenting large deficiencies in both spatial and cued Morris water maze (MWM) tasks. Conversely, working spatial memory determined with the Y-maze and spatial memory measured with the Barnes maze were not affected, suggesting that deficits in MWM were unrelated to spatial memory abnormalities. Supporting this interpretation, VAChT mutants exhibited alterations in anxiety-like behavior and increased corticosterone levels after exposure to the MWM, suggesting altered stress response. Thus, PPT/LDT VAChT-mutant mice present little cognitive impairment per se, yet they exhibit increased susceptibility to stress, which may lead to performance deficits in more stressful conditions.—Janickova, H., Kljakic, O., Rosborough, K., Raulic, S., Matovic, S., Gros, R., Saksida, L.

We found that knockdown of the mlf gene resulted in a significant decrease of cwp gene expression and cyst formation, suggesting a positive role of MLF in encystation. We further used mlf as a model gene to improve the system. The addition of an inhibitor for NHEJ, Scr7, or combining all cassettes for gRNA and Cas9 expression into one plasmid resulted in improved gene disruption efficiencies and a significant decrease in cwp gene expression. Our results provide insights into a positive role of MLF in inducing Giardia differentiation and a useful tool for studies in Giardia."
https://openalex.org/W2921494229,"Alcoholic beverages, which are consumed widely in most parts of the world, have long been identified as a major risk factor for all liver diseases, particularly alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Recent compositional analyses suggest that Chinese baijiu (CB), a clear alcoholic liquid distilled from fermented grains, contains large amounts of small molecule bioactive compounds in addition to a significant amount of ethanol (EtOH). Here, in an experimental mouse model, we show that CB caused lower degrees of liver injury than pure EtOH by protecting against the decrease of the relative abundance of Akkermansia and increase of the relative abundance of Prevotella in the gut, thereby preventing the destruction of the intestinal barrier. Furthermore, we demonstrated that EtOH-induced alteration of the gut microbiota profoundly affected the host metabolome. Compared with EtOH feeding, CB feeding resulted in higher concentrations of functional saturated long-chain fatty acids and short-chain fatty acids. The additional mouse models of low dosages of EtOH and of blending baijiu validated that volatile compounds in CB can attenuate EtOH-induced liver damages. Our results provide supporting evidence that ALD was profoundly influenced by host-gut microbiota metabolic interactions and that small molecule organic compounds in CB could attenuate ALD.—Fang, C., Du, H., Zheng, X., Zhao, A., Jia, W., Xu, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2922422364,"The DEP1 (dense and erect panicle 1) gene, which corresponds to the erect panicle architecture, shows a pleiotropic effect in increasing grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in rice. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the carbon-nitrogen metabolic balance changes as the dep1 allele enhances nitrogen uptake and assimilation. In this study, we generated transgenic Akitakomati plants by overexpressing dep1 and analyzed the carbon-nitrogen metabolic status, gene expression profiles, and grain yield and quality. Under either low or high nitrogen growth conditions, the carbon-nitrogen metabolic balance of dep1-overexpressed lines was broken in stem sheaths and leaves but not in grains; the dep1-overexpressed plants showed higher expressions of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) genes than the wildtype, along with increased total nitrogen and soluble protein content in the straw at maturity. However, the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RUBISCO) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) genes were downregulated in dep1-overexpressed plants, leading to a decreased carbohydrate content and carbon/nitrogen ratio. Although the unbalanced carbon-nitrogen metabolism decreased the grain-filling rate, grain setting percentage, 1000 grain weight, and grain quality in dep1-overexpressed lines, it led to increased grain numbers per panicle and consequently increased grain yield. Our results suggest that an unbalanced carbon-nitrogen metabolic status is a major limiting factor for further improving grain yield and quality in erect panicle varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2921283028,"This study aimed to identify any association of serum nitric oxide (NO) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) with body mass index (BMI) in apparently healthy subjects. In this cross-sectional study, participants were 90 apparently healthy subjects, categorized into three BMI groups as follows: BMI≤19.5 (n = 21), 19.6≤BMI≤24.9 (n = 35), and BMI≥25 (n = 34). Serum levels of NO were measured by griess reaction method. Determination of serum pentosidine and carboxymethyllysine (CML) was done using ELISA. Median (95% confidence interval [CI]: lower- upper) of serum NO in subjects with BMI≥25 were 68.94 (CI: 55.01–70.56) μmol/L, which was higher compared with 19.6≤BMI≤24.9 and BMI≤19.5 groups (22.65 (CI: 19.29–28.17) μmol/L and 8.00 (CI: 9.12–29.58) μmol/L, respectively). Serum NO positively correlated with BMI in total subjects (r = 0.585, p<0.001), which this correlation was significant in both male and female groups (r = 0.735, p<0.001 and r = 0.476, p = 0.001, respectively). Serum pentosidine and CML were significantly lower in subjects with higher BMI. Further, BMI showed negative correlations with pentosidine and CML (r = -0.363, p<0.001 and r = -0.484, p<0.001, respectively). There were not any significant differences in serum NO, pentosidine, and CML levels between sex groups. After adjusting the effects of confounders (BMI, sex, age, and waist to hip ratio), serum NO significantly correlated with serum pentosidine and CML (r = -0.319, p = 0.003 and r = -0.433, p<0.001, respectively). It is concluded that higher BMI is accompanied by increased serum NO and suppressed pentosidine and CML."
https://openalex.org/W2921683662,"Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) is frequent among Escherichia coli from various food products and animals in several countries. The objective of this study was to characterize quinolone resistant E. coli (QREC) from Norwegian turkey meat regarding resistance profiles, genetic mechanisms for quinolone resistance, genetic relatedness, and to investigate whether PMQR genes were present. In total, 78 QREC were isolated by a selective method from 156 samples throughout 2013. Isolates were subjected to susceptibility testing, characterization of resistance mechanisms, serotyping, phylotyping and multi-locus variable-tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). All 78 isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, while 77 were also resistant to nalidixic acid. The nalidixic acid sensitive isolate had a resistance profile indicating the presence of a PMQR gene. Both PCR and whole genome sequencing confirmed the presence of a 47 304 kb IncX1 plasmid containing the qnrS1 gene. The mechanism conferring quinolone resistance in the remaining isolates was mediated by mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of the chromosomal gyrA gene and for most of the isolates also in the parC gene. Molecular typing by MLVA showed a high degree of genetic diversity, although four clusters dominated. Two clusters contained strains belonging to phylogroup D/serogroup O176, the third contained isolates of phylogroup B1/serogroup O19, whereas the fourth contained isolates of phylogroup B1/non-typeable serogroup. Isolates within the latter cluster had MLVA profiles identical to QREC isolated from day-old imported turkey parent animals investigated in a preliminary study at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute. This finding suggests that QREC obtained from turkey may have been introduced via import of breeding animals to Norway. This is the first time the qnrS1 gene is described from E. coli isolated from Norwegian turkey meat. Compared to available qnrS1 carrying plasmids in Genbank, the current IncX1 plasmid showed high degree of similarity to other IncX1 plasmids containing qnrS1 isolated from both Shigella flexneri and E. coli found in different geographical areas and sources. To conclude, this study showed that mutations in gyrA and parC are the main mechanism conferring quinolone resistance in E. coli isolated from Norwegian turkey meat, and that PMQR has not been widely dispersed throughout the E. coli population in Norwegian turkey."

Their diet varies by season, including plants or plant parts of high nutritional value, but also toxic plant secondary metabolites (PSMs). Little is known about the microbes driving organic matter decomposition in the cecum of ptarmigans, especially the last steps leading to methanogenesis. The cecum microbiome in wild rock ptarmigans from Arctic Norway was characterized to unveil their functional potential for PSM detoxification, methanogenesis and polysaccharides degradation. Cecal samples were collected from wild ptarmigans from Svalbard (L. m. hyperborea) and northern Norway (L. m. muta) during autumn/winter (Sept-Dec). Samples from captive Svalbard ptarmigans fed commercial pelleted feed were included to investigate the effect of diet on microbial composition and function. Abundances of methanogens and bacteria were determined by qRT-PCR, while microbial community composition and functional potential were studied using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics. Abundances of bacteria and methanogenic Archaea were higher in wild ptarmigans compared to captive birds. The ceca of wild ptarmigans housed bacterial groups involved in PSM-degradation, and genes mediating the conversion of phenol compounds to pyruvate. Methanomassiliicoccaceae was the major archaeal family in wild ptarmigans, carrying the genes for methanogenesis from methanol. It might be related to increased methanol production from pectin degradation in wild birds due to a diet consisting of primarily fresh pectin-rich plants. Both wild and captive ptarmigans possessed a broad suite of genes for the depolymerization of hemicellulose and non-cellulosic polysaccharides (e.g. starch). In conclusion, there were no physiological and phenotypical dissimilarities in the microbiota found in the cecum of wild ptarmigans on mainland Norway and Svalbard. While substantial differences in the functional potential for PSM degradation and methanogenesis in wild and captive birds seem to be a direct consequence of their dissimilar diets."

Using isothermal calorimetry, we characterized several metal-binding sites (four per dimer) involving the His-rich motifs and having similar metal affinity (KD = 1.6 μm). Remarkably, biophysical approaches, site-directed mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography uncovered an additional nickel-binding site at the dimer interface, which binds Ni(II) with an affinity of 380 nm. Although RrCooJ was initially thought to be a unique protein, a proteome database search identified at least 46 bacterial CooJ homologs. These homologs all possess two spatially separated nickel-binding motifs: a variable C-terminal histidine tail and a strictly conserved H(W/F)X2HX3H motif, identified in this study, suggesting a dual function for CooJ both as a nickel chaperone and as a nickel storage protein.

https://openalex.org/W2922263232,"Mitochondria are major sites of energy metabolism that influence numerous cellular events, including immunity and cancer development. Previously, we reported that the mitochondrion-specific antioxidant enzyme, manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), has dual roles in early- and late-carcinogenesis stages. However, how defective MnSOD impacts the chain of events that lead to cell transformation in pathologically normal epidermal cells that have been exposed to carcinogens is unknown. Here, we show that UVB radiation causes nitration and inactivation of MnSOD leading to mitochondrial injury and mitophagy. In keratinocytes, exposure to UVB radiation decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, increased glycolysis and the expression of autophagy-related genes, and enhanced AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT) phosphorylation and cell growth. Interestingly, UVB initiated a prosurvival mitophagy response by mitochondria-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling via the mammalian target of the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) pathway. Knockdown of rictor but not raptor abrogated UVB-induced mitophagy responses. Furthermore, fractionation and proximity-ligation assays reveal that ROS-mediated mTOC2 activation in mitochondria is necessary for UVB-induced mitophagy. Importantly, pretreatment with the MnSOD mimic MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (MnP) attenuates mTORC2 activation and suppresses UVB-induced mitophagy. UVB radiation exposure also increased cell growth as assessed by soft-agar colony survival and cell growth assays, and pretreatment with MnP or the known autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine abrogated UVB-induced cell growth. These results indicate that MnSOD is a major redox regulator that maintains mitochondrial health and show that UVB-mediated MnSOD inactivation promotes mitophagy and thereby prevents accumulation of damaged mitochondria."

Yet our knowledge on the relationship between height growth and climate for Mongolian pine is limited. Based on survey data for the dominant height of Mongolian pine and climate data from meteorological station, a mixed-effects Chapman-Richards model (including climate factors and random parameters) was used to study the effects of climate factors on the height growth of Mongolian pine in Zhanggutai sandy land, Northeast China. The results showed that precipitation had a delayed effect on the tree height growth. Generally, tree heights increased with increasing mean temperature in May and precipitation from October to April and decreased with increasing precipitation in the previous growing season. The model could effectively predict the dominant height growth of Mongolian pine under varying climate, which could help in further understanding the relationship between climate and height growth of Mongolian pine in semiarid areas of China."

VLCFAs are synthesized by fatty acid elongase (FAE), which is an integral membrane enzyme system with multiple components. The genetic complexity of the FAE system, and its membrane association has hampered the biochemical characterization of FAE. In this study we computationally identified Zea mays genetic sequences that encode the enzymatic components of FAE and developed a heterologous expression system to evaluate their functionality. The ability of the maize components to genetically complement Saccharomyces cerevisiae lethal mutants confirmed the functionality of ZmKCS4, ZmELO1, ZmKCR1, ZmKCR2, ZmHCD and ZmECR, and the VLCFA profiles of the resulting strains were used to infer the ability of each enzyme component to determine the product profile of FAE.

This randomized study included 461 adolescents from public schools in Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil (intervention group: 273 students from four schools; control group: 188 students from three schools). Mean age was 14.8±1.0, and 52.9% were boys. The intervention consisted of three meetings with interactive activities about principles of healthy eating, food classification, importance of reading labels and analyzing food advertising critically, and representations of healthy and unhealthy meals and their sugar, salt, and fat content. Pictorial materials consisted of food drawings, food models, and a food packaging model. Controls were not exposed to any activity. Dietary knowledge, consumption, and behaviors were the variables of interest. The intervention group showed a higher mean score of correct answers to questions about dietary knowledge than the control group (p = 0.0006), with higher odds of correctly answering questions about in natura (OR: 3.7; 95% CI: 1.9–6.6), minimally processed (OR: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.9–6.4), processed (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1–4.3), and ultra-processed foods (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.8–6.6) and composition of ultra-processed foods (OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.3–4.4). Participants in the intervention group were also 2.5 times more likely to correctly answer questions about the importance of the dietary environment (95% CI: 1.1–5.5) and caution with food advertising (95% CI: 1.2–5.3) than controls.

https://openalex.org/W2921827667,"The myeloid translocation gene family member MTG16 is a transcriptional corepressor that relies on the DNA-binding ability of other proteins to determine specificity. One such protein is the ZBTB family member Kaiso, and the MTG16:Kaiso interaction is necessary for repression of Kaiso target genes, such as matrix metalloproteinase-7. Using the azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) murine model of colitis-associated carcinoma, we previously determined that MTG16 loss accelerates tumorigenesis and inflammation. However, it was unknown whether this effect was modified by Kaiso-dependent transcriptional repression. To test for a genetic interaction between MTG16 and Kaiso in inflammatory carcinogenesis, we subjected single and double knockout (DKO) mice to the AOM/DSS protocol. Mtg16-/- mice demonstrated increased colitis and tumor burden; in contrast, disease severity in Kaiso-/- mice was equivalent to wild-type controls. Surprisingly, Kaiso deficiency in the context of MTG16 loss reversed injury and pro-tumorigenic responses in the intestinal epithelium following AOM/DSS treatment, and tumor numbers were returned to near to wild-type levels. Transcriptomic analysis of non-tumor colon tissue demonstrated that changes induced by MTG16 loss were widely mitigated by concurrent Kaiso loss, and DKO mice demonstrated downregulation of metabolism and cytokine-associated gene sets with concurrent activation of DNA damage checkpoint pathways as compared with Mtg16-/-. Further, Kaiso knockdown in intestinal enteroids reduced stem- and WNT-associated phenotypes, thus abrogating the induction of these pathways observed in Mtg16-/- samples. Together, these data suggest that Kaiso modifies MTG16-driven inflammation and tumorigenesis and suggests that Kaiso deregulation contributes to MTG16-dependent colitis and CAC phenotypes."

Accordingly, intensive research has focused on functionalizing non-autologous materials with angiogenic factors. In the current study we evaluated a method for coupling an angiogenic peptide to the surface of two clinically-relevant graft materials, anorganic bovine bone (ABB) and synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA). Specifically, the VEGF-derived “QK” peptide was synthesized with a heptaglutamate (E7) domain, a motif that has strong affinity for calcium phosphate graft materials. Compared with unmodified QK, a 4–6 fold enrichment was observed in the binding of E7-modified QK (E7-QK) to ABB and HA. The E7-QK peptide was then assessed for its capacity to stimulate angiogenic cell behaviors. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with solutions of either QK or E7-QK, and it was found that QK and E7-QK elicited equivalent levels of cell migration, tubule formation and activation of the Akt and ERK signaling pathways. These data confirmed that the inherent bioactivity of the QK sequence was not diminished by the addition of the E7 domain. We further verified that the activity of E7-QK was retained following peptide binding to the graft surface. HA disks were coated with QK or E7-QK, and then HUVECs were seeded onto the disks. Consistent with the increased amount of E7-QK bound to HA, relative to QK, markedly greater activation of Akt and ERK 1/2 was observed in cells exposed to the E7-QK-coated disks. Taken together, these results suggest that the E7 domain can be leveraged to concentrate angiogenic peptides on graft materials, facilitating delivery of higher peptide concentrations within the graft site. The ability to endow diverse graft materials with angiogenic potential holds promise for augmenting the regenerative capacity of non-autologous bone grafts."

However, the repercussions of late-onset sensory deprivations on functionality of the remaining sensory cortices are poorly understood. Using repeated intrinsic signal imaging we investigated the effects of whisker or auditory deprivation (WD or AD, respectively) on responsiveness of the binocular primary visual cortex (V1) in fully adult mice. The binocular zone of mice is innervated by both eyes, with the contralateral eye always dominating V1 input over ipsilateral eye input, the normal ocular dominance (OD) ratio. Strikingly, we found that 3 days of WD or AD induced a transient shift of OD, which was mediated by a potentiation of V1 input through the ipsilateral eye. This cross-modal effect was accompanied by strengthening of layer 4 synapses in V1, required visual experience through the ipsilateral eye and was mediated by an increase of the excitation/inhibition ratio in V1. Finally, we demonstrate that both WD and AD induced a long-lasting improvement of visual performance. Our data provide evidence that the deprivation of a non-visual sensory modality cross-modally induces experience dependent V1 plasticity and improves visual behavior, even in adult mice."

The method utilized UHPLC-MS in electrospray ionization mode (ESI). Samples were prepared by alkaline hydrolysis; sequential vortex extraction with ethyl acetate, methanol and acetonitrile; followed by a QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) clean-up method. The system suitability tests including theoretical plate number, resolution, repeatability, tailing factor proved the system's resolution and reproducibility that can meet the requirements of sample analysis. The developed method resulted in satisfactory recoveries that varied from 75.4%-110.6% and relative standard deviations (RSDs) that ranged from 3.1%-10.5%. The ranges of the limits of detection (LODs) and the limits of quantitation (LOQs) were 2-30 ng kg-1 and 10-100 ng kg-1, respectively. 14 hormones including cortisone, aldosterone, testosterone propionate, estriol, megestrol acetate, cortisone acetate, dexamethasone, testosterone, hydroxyprogesterone, nandrolone, prednisolone, cortisol, progesterone and estradiol were found in Antarctic krill. Other 3 hormones (Diethylstilbestrol, norethisterone and androsterone) were not detected. The levels of exogenous steroid hormones were much greater than those of endogenous steroid hormones, and the levels of exogenous glucocorticoids were much greater than those of exogenous sex hormones. The changes of hormones in different sex and maturity stages were also explored. Endogenous hormones might regulate the reproductive and development of Antarctic krill. The detected exogenous hormones suggests the potential for hormonal contamination in Antarctic waters that can affect organisms even affect human beings by food chain."

The aim of this study is to investigate the recall rate at first screen and to identify potential predictors of false-positive recall in a multi-ethnic Asian population-based breast cancer screening programme. Methods Women aged 50–64 years attending screening mammography for the first time (n = 25,318) were included in this study. The associations between potential predictors (sociodemographic, lifestyle and reproductive) and false-positive recall were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models. Results The recall rate was 7.6% (n = 1,923), of which with 93.8% were false-positive. Factors independently associated with higher false-positive recall included Indian ethnicity (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.52 [1.25 to 1.84]), premenopause (1.23 [1.04 to 1.44]), nulliparity (1.85 [1.57 to 2.17]), recent breast symptoms (1.72 [1.31 to 2.23]) and history of breast lump excision (1.87 [1.53 to 2.26]). Factors associated with lower risk of false-positive recall included older age at screen (0.84 [0.73 to 0.97]) and use of oral contraceptives (0.87 [0.78 to 0.97]). After further adjustment of percent mammographic density, associations with older age at screening (0.97 [0.84 to 1.11]) and menopausal status (1.12 [0.95 to 1.32]) were attenuated and no longer significant. Conclusion For every breast cancer identified, 15 women without cancer were subjected to further testing. Efforts to educate Asian women on what it means to be recalled will be useful in reducing unnecessary stress and anxiety."

Here, we used site-directed mutagenesis, the substituted-cysteine accessibility method, functional analyses, and homology modeling to determine whether the D109A substitution locks PCFT in one of its conformational states. Cys-substituted residues lining the PCFT aqueous translocation pathway and accessible in WT PCFT to the membrane-impermeable cysteine-biotinylation reagent, MTSEA-biotin, lost accessibility when introduced into the D109A scaffold. Substitutions at Gly-305 located exofacially within the eighth TMD, particularly with bulky residues, when introduced into the D109A scaffold largely restored function and MTSEA-biotin accessibility to Cys-substituted residues within the pathway. Likewise, Ser-196 substitution in the fifth TMD, predicted by homology modeling to be in proximity to Gly-305, also partially restored function found in solute transporters, is critical to oscillation of the carrier among its conformational states. Substitutions at Asp-109 and Gly-112 lock PCFT in an inward-open conformation, resulting in the loss of function. However, the integrity of the locked protein is preserved, indicated by the restoration of function after insertion of a second unlocking mutation. and accessibility. Similarly, the inactivating G112K substitution within the first intracellular loop was partially reactivated by introducing the G305L substitution. These data indicate that the first intracellular loop, with a sequence identical to motif A (GXXXDXXGR(R/K))."

We observed higher concentrations of glucose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, sucrose 6-phosphate, and sucrose in high-oil content palms with the greatest difference being at 11:00 (p-value ≤0.05) immediately after the period of low morning light intensity. Three important photosynthetic genes were identified using differentially expressed gene analysis (DEGs) and were found to be significantly enriched through Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment: chlorophyll a-b binding protein (CAB-13), photosystem I (PSI), and Ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR), particularly for sampling points at non-peak light (11:00 and 19:00), ranging from 3.3-fold (PSI) and 5.6-fold (FNR) to 10.3-fold (CAB-13). Subsequent gas exchange measurements further supported increased carbon assimilation through higher level of internal CO2 concentration (Ci), stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E) in high-oil content palms. The selection for higher expression of key photosynthesis genes together with CO2 assimilation under low light is likely to be important for crop improvement, in particular at full maturity and under high density planting regimes where light competition exists between palms."
https://openalex.org/W2921102160,"Leukoaraiosis regions may be more vulnerable to decreases in cerebral perfusion. We aimed to assess perfusion in leukoaraiosis regions in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients. We tested the hypothesis that aggressive acute BP reduction in ICH patients is associated with hypoperfusion in areas of leukoaraiosis. In the ICH Acutely Decreasing Arterial Pressure Trial (ICH ADAPT), patients with ICH <24 hours duration were randomized to two systolic BP (SBP) target groups (<150 mmHg vs. <180 mmHg). Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging was performed 2h post-randomization. Leukoaraiosis tissue volumes were planimetrically measured using semi-automated threshold techniques on the acute non-contrast CT. CTP source leukoaraiosis region-of-interest object maps were co-registered with CTP post-processed maps to assess cerebral perfusion in these areas. Seventy-one patients were included with a mean age of 69±11.4 years, 52 of whom had leukoaraiosis. The mean relative Tmax (rTmax) of leukoaraiotic tissue (2.3±2s) was prolonged compared to that of normal appearing white matter in patients without leukoaraiosis (1.1±1.2s, p = 0.04). In the 52 patients with leukoaraiosis, SBP in the aggressive treatment group (145±20.4 mmHg, n = 27) was significantly lower than that in the conservative group (159.9±13.1 mmHg, n = 25, p = 0.001) at the time of CTP. Despite this SBP difference, mean leukoaraiosis rTmax was similar in the two treatment groups (2.6±2.3 vs. 1.8±1.6 seconds, p = 0.3). Cerebral perfusion in tissue affected by leukoaraiosis is hypoperfused in acute ICH patients. Aggressive BP reduction does not appear to acutely aggravate cerebral hypoperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2921118484,"Background Male circumcision devices have the potential to accelerate adolescent voluntary medical male circumcision roll-out. Here, we present findings on safety, acceptability and satisfaction from active surveillance of PrePex implementation among 618 adolescent males (13–17 years) circumcised in Zimbabwe. Methods The first 618 adolescents consecutively circumcised from October 2015 to October 2016 using PrePex during routine service delivery were actively followed up. Outcome measures included PrePex uptake, attendance for post-circumcision visits and adverse events (AEs). A survey was conducted amongst 500 consecutive active surveillance clients to assess acceptability and satisfaction with PrePex. Results A total of 1,811 adolescent males were circumcised across the three PrePex active surveillance sites. Of these, 870 (48%) opted for PrePex but only 618/870 (71%) were eligible. Among the 618, two (0.3%) self-removals requiring surgery (severe AEs), were observed. Four (0.6%) removals by providers (moderate AEs) did not require surgery. Another 6 (1%) mild AEs were due to: bleeding (n = 2), swelling (n = 2), and infection (n = 2). All AEs resolved without sequelae. Adherence to follow-up appointments was high (97.7% attended 7 day visit). A high proportion (71.6%) of survey respondents said they heard about PrePex from a mobilizer; 49.8% said they chose PrePex because they wanted to avoid the pain associated with the surgical procedure/surgery on their penis. Acceptability and satisfaction with PrePex was high; 95.4% indicated willingness to recommend PrePex to peers. A majority (92%) reported experiencing pain when PrePex was being removed. Conclusions Active surveillance of the first 618 adolescent males circumcised using PrePex suggests that the device is both safe and acceptable when used in routine service delivery among 13–17 year-olds. There is need to intensify specific demand generation activities for PrePex male circumcision among this group of males."
https://openalex.org/W2921139645,"The release of unwanted fish from purse seines whilst still in the water is termed slipping and may lead to significant mortality following release. The objective of this study was to determine the fish welfare implications of a new slipping methodology in which fish are released via a discharge opening formed in the bunt end of the purse seine net. Video analyses of collective and individual level fish behaviour were undertaken in the Norwegian mackerel and herring purse seine fisheries, to quantitively describe slipping behaviour and to determine its driving factors. The majority of fish escaped the purse seine with the schooling structure intact as part of large groups towards the end of slipping process, increasing their speed following escape. However, there was also a tendency (24% of all escapes) to escape in a manner likely to impact negatively upon their welfare, with a breakdown in schooling structure and physical contact with the fishing gear and conspecifics. The tendency to express such welfare compromising behaviour was higher for mackerel than for herring, but was also influenced by the vessel releasing the fish, the amount of fish being slipped, how long the discharge opening had been open and the particular slipping event. These results provide important information for future science-based development of welfare friendly slipping practises."
https://openalex.org/W2921879849,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) plays a key role in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which is a vital cofactor in redox reactions and a substrate for NAD+ consuming enzymes including CD38, PARPs and sirtuins. NAMPT over-expression has been shown in various cancers and its inhibition decreases cancer cell growth, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Here we examine the NAMPT expression in a large cohort of resected stage I/II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) and correlate its expression with clinical outcomes and pathologic features.A retrospective review of patients with PDAs was conducted at a single institution. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing primary PDAs and their metastatic lymph nodes (mLNs) were constructed and stained for NAMPT expression. Each TMA core was evaluated for staining intensity of cancer cells (0 = no staining, 1+ = weak, 2+ = moderate, 3+ = strong) and a mean score was calculated for each case with at least two evaluable cores. NAMPT expression was correlated with clinicopathological variables using chi-squared or Fisher's exact test, and t-tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Survival probabilities were estimated and plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the effects of NAMPT staining values on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). This study was conducted under an approved IRB protocol.173 primary PDAs had at least 2 TMA cores with identifiable cancer cells. The mean IHC score was 0.55 (range: 0 to 2.33). The mean IHC score of mLNs was 0.39 (range: 0-2), which was not significantly different from their primary tumors (mean IHC score = 0.47, P = 0.38). Sixty-four percent (111/173) of PDAs were positive for NAMPT staining. Stage II tumors were more likely to be positive (68% of 151 vs 41% of 22; P = 0.01). Non-obese non-diabetic patients were more likely to have NAMPT+ tumors (43.7% vs. 27.9%, P = 0.04). While RFS and OS were not statistically different between NAMPT+ vs. NAMPT- PDAs, patients with NAMPT- tumors tended to have a longer median OS (26.0 vs. 20.4 months, P = 0.34).NAMPT expression was detected in 64% of stage I/II PDAs and up to 72% in non-obese non-diabetic patients. Frequency of NAMPT expression correlated with pathological stage, consistent with published literature regarding its role in cancer progression. While RFS and OS were not statistically significantly different, patients with NAMPT+ PDAs tended to have a shorter survival. Thus, NAMPT inhibition may prove beneficial in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2922059842,"Brucella abortus RB51 is an attenuated, stable, spontaneous rough mutant derived in the laboratory from the virulent strain B. abortus 2308. Previous studies discovered that the wboA gene, which encodes a glycosyltransferase required for synthesis of the O-polysaccharide, is disrupted in strain RB51 by an IS711 element. However, complementation of strain RB51 with a functional wboA gene (strain RB51WboA) does not confer it a smooth phenotype but results in low levels of cytoplasmic O-polysaccharide synthesis. In this study, we asked if increasing the potential availability of bactoprenol priming precursors in strain RB51WboA would increase the levels of O-polysaccharide synthesis and enhance the protective efficacy against virulent Brucella challenge. To achieve this, we overexpressed the wbkF gene, which encodes a putative undecaprenyl-glycosyltransferase involved in bactoprenol priming for O-polysaccharide polymerization, in strain RB51WboA to generate strain RB51WboAKF. In comparison to strain RB51WboA, strain RB51WboAKF expressed higher levels of O-polysaccharide, but was still attenuated and remained phenotypically rough. Mice immunized with strain RB51WboAKF developed increased levels of smooth LPS-specific serum antibodies, primarily of IgG2a and IgG3 isotype. Splenocytes from mice vaccinated with strain RB51WboAKF secreted higher levels of antigen-specific IFN-γ and TNF-α and contained more numbers of antigen-specific IFN-γ secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes when compared to those of the RB51 or RB51WboA vaccinated groups. Immunization with strain RB51WboAKF conferred enhanced protection against virulent B. abortus 2308, B. melitensis 16M and B. suis 1330 challenge when compared to the currently used vaccine strains. Our results suggest that strain RB51WboAKF has the potential to be a more efficacious vaccine than its parent strain in natural hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2921186868,"Protein expression of Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate like-1 (MARCKSL1) has been identified as a prognostic factor in lymph-node negative (LN-) breast cancer patients. We aim to validate MARCKSL1 protein expression as a prognostic marker for distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in a new cohort of LN- breast cancer patients. MARCKSL1 expression was evaluated in 151 operable T1,2N0M0 LN- breast cancer patients by immunohistochemistry. Median follow-up time was 152 months, range 11–189 months. Results were compared with classical prognosticators (age, tumor diameter, grade, estrogen receptor, and proliferation) using single (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate (Cox model) survival analysis. Thirteen patients (9%) developed distant metastases. With both single and multiple analysis of all features, MARCKSL1 did not show a significant prognostic value for DMFS (p = 0.498). Of the assessed classical prognosticators, only tumor diameter showed prognostic value (hazard ratio 9.3, 95% confidence interval 2.8–31.0, p <0.001). MARCKSL1 expression could not be confirmed as a prognostic factor in this cohort. Possible reasons include changes in diagnostic and treatment guidelines between the discovery and validation cohorts. Further studies are needed to reveal the potential biological role of this protein in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2921266998,"Background/Aim Patients with primary extra-thoracic malignancy (ETM) often have hyper-metabolic mediastinal lymph nodes (HM-MLN) in the PET-scan done for initial staging or post treatment follow-up. There is scant data on the etiology of HM-MLN in such patients, which can also be due to non-malignant causes. We used endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided sampling to determine the etiology of HM-MLN in patients with ETM and study the relationship between PET-SUV values and a diagnosis of malignancy in this population. Materials and methods 65 consecutive patients, from March 2013 to March 2017 with either known ETM for primary staging or post-treatment follow-up, with PET CT showing HM-MLN (SUV > 2.5) were included in the study. Results 65 patients with ETM had EBUS-TBNA for HM-MLN. 20/65 (30.7%) were malignant, 45/65 (69.23%) were benign MLN. In patients with benign etiology of HM-MLN, 6/45 (13.3%) had necrotising granulomatous, 24/45 (53.3%) had non- necrotising granulomatous MLN and 15/45 (33.3%) had reactive MLN. We found discordance (i.e. primary ETM responded to treatment and a new HM-MLN was detected) in 21/65 (32.3%) patients with PET-CT done for initial ETM staging, and 44/65 (67.7%) with a post-treatment PET-CT. showed. Correlating SUV with diagnoses, the SUV values in EBUS-proven malignant MLN were 8.9 ± 4.1, while they were 10.2 ± 5.57 in benign MLN. There was no statistically significant difference between the SUV of benign and malignant MLNs. Conclusion This study shows a significant incidence of EBUS-TBNA proven benign diagnoses 45/65 (69.2%) in ‘SUV-deemed-malignant MLN’ and a poor relationship between high SUV and malignant MLN, in patients with known ETM. The ETM related HM-MLN have a significant chance of being benign, and a tissue diagnosis is imperative as it impacts on the treatment plan and prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2921363419,"Here we provide an empirical hydrologic foundation to inform water management decisions in the El Yunque National Forest (EYNF) in eastern Puerto Rico. Tropical watershed hydrology has proven difficult to quantify due to high rainfall variability, high evapotranspiration rates, variation in forest canopy interception and storage, and uncertain hydrologic inputs from fog condensation in cloud forests. We developed mass-balance and observation-based water budgets for nine local watersheds within the EYNF using a novel assemblage of remotely sensed rainfall data, gaged streamflow observations, and municipal water withdrawal rates. It is important to note that, while prior budgets considered large water withdrawals outside (downstream) of EYNF boundaries, our current budget is confined to within EYNF boundaries. Here, we also base our estimates of water withdrawal volume on operational data, in contrast to prior water budgets that estimated volume based on either the capacity of known water intakes or regulatory permit limits. This resulted in more conservative and realistic estimates of withdrawals from within the EYNF. Finally, we also discuss the ecological importance of considering the effects of water withdrawals not only at an average monthly scale, but also on the basis of exceedance probability to avoid over-abstraction for the protection of native migratory fishes and shrimps. This analysis highlights a number of unique challenges associated with developing hydrologic foundations for water management in tropical ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2922364079,"The ability to image biological tissues is critical to our understanding of a range of systems and processes. In the case of in situ living tissue, such imaging is hampered by the innate mechanical properties of the tissue. In many cases, this provides challenges in how to process large amounts of image data which may contain aberrations from movement. Generally, current tools require the provision of reference images and are unable to maintain temporal correlations within an image set. Here, we describe a tool–Tify–which can accurately predict a numerical quality score versus human scoring and can analyse image sets in a manner that allows the maintenance of temporal relationships. The tool uses regression-based techniques to link image statistics to image quality based on user provided scores from a sample of images. Scores calculated by the software correlate strongly with the scores provided by human users. We identified that, in most cases, the software requires users to score between 20–30 frames in order to be able to accurately calculate the remaining images. Importantly, our results suggest that the software can use coefficients generated from consolidated image sets to process images without the need for additional manual scoring. Finally, the tool is able to use a frame windowing technique to identify the highest quality frame from a moving window, thus retaining macro-chronological connections between frames. In summary, Tify is able to successfully predict the quality of images in an image set based on a small number of sample scores provided by end-users. This software has the potential to improve the effectiveness of biological imaging techniques where motion artefacts, even in the presence of stabilisation, pose a significant problem."
https://openalex.org/W2921008999,"Good team decisions require that team members share information with each other. Yet, members often tend to selfishly withhold important information. Does this tendency depend on their power within the team? Power-holders frequently act more selfishly (than the powerless)—accordingly, they might be tempted to withhold information. We predicted that given a task goal to ‘solve a task’, power-holders would selfishly share less information than the powerless. However, a group goal to ‘solve the task together’ would compensate for this selfishness, heightening particularly power-holders’ information sharing. In parallel, an individual goal to ‘solve the task alone’ may heighten selfishness and lower information sharing (even) among the powerless. We report five experiments (N = 1305), comprising all studies conducted in their original order. Analyses yielded weak to no evidence for these predictions; the findings rather supported the beneficial role of a group goal to ensure information sharing for both the powerful and the powerless."
