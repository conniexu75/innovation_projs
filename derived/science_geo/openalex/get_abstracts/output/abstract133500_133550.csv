https://openalex.org/W2016411107,"Homozygous mice with a null mutation in the MMP-9/gelatinase B gene exhibit an abnormal pattern of skeletal growth plate vascularization and ossification. Although hypertrophic chondrocytes develop normally, apoptosis, vascularization, and ossification are delayed, resulting in progressive lengthening of the growth plate to about eight times normal. After 3 weeks postnatal, aberrant apoptosis, vascularization, and ossification compensate to remodel the enlarged growth plate and ultimately produce an axial skeleton of normal appearance. Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow cells rescues vascularization and ossification in gelatinase B–null growth plates, indicating that these processes are mediated by gelatinase B–expressing cells of bone marrow origin, designated chondroclasts. Growth plates from gelatinase B–null mice in culture show a delayed release of an angiogenic activator, establishing a role for this proteinase in controlling angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2120365943,"Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased cancer incidence, cell cycle checkpoint defects, and ionizing radiation sensitivity. We have isolated the gene encoding p95, a member of the hMre11/hRad50 double-strand break repair complex. The p95 gene mapped to 8q21.3, the region that contains the NBS locus, and p95 was absent from NBS cells established from NBS patients. p95 deficiency in these cells completely abrogates the formation of hMre11/hRad50 ionizing radiation-induced foci. Comparison of the p95 cDNA to the NBS1 cDNA indicated that the p95 gene and NBS1 are identical. The implication of hMre11/hRad50/p95 protein complex in NBS reveals a direct molecular link between DSB repair and cell cycle checkpoint functions."
https://openalex.org/W2002782759,"A variety of cytokines activate receptor-associated members of the Janus family of protein tyrosine kinases (Jaks). To assess the role of Jak2, we have derived Jak2-deficient mice. The mutation causes an embryonic lethality due to the absence of definitive erythropoiesis. Fetal liver myeloid progenitors, although present based on the expression of lineage specific markers, fail to respond to erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, interleukin-3 (IL-3), or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In contrast, the response to granulocyte specific colony-stimulating factor is unaffected. Jak2-deficient fibroblasts failed to respond to interferon gamma (IFNgamma), although the responses to IFNalpha/beta and IL-6 were unaffected. Lastly, reconstitution experiments demonstrate that Jak2 is not required for the generation of lymphoid progenitors, their amplification, or functional differentiation. Therefore, Jak2 plays a critical, nonredundant role in the function of a specific group of cytokines receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2152054208,"Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive chromosomal instability syndrome characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition. Cells from NBS patients are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation with cytogenetic features indistinguishable from ataxia telangiectasia. We describe the positional cloning of a gene encoding a novel protein, nibrin. It contains two modules found in cell cycle checkpoint proteins, a forkhead-associated domain adjacent to a breast cancer carboxy-terminal domain. A truncating 5 bp deletion was identified in the majority of NBS patients, carrying a conserved marker haplotype. Five further truncating mutations were identified in patients with other distinct haplotypes. The domains found in nibrin and the NBS phenotype suggest that this disorder is caused by defective responses to DNA double-strand breaks."
https://openalex.org/W2062809474,"The transcriptional coactivator and integrator p300 and its closely related family member CBP mediate multiple, signal-dependent transcriptional events. We have generated mice lacking a functional p300 gene. Animals nullizygous for p300 died between days 9 and 11.5 of gestation, exhibiting defects in neurulation, cell proliferation, and heart development. Cells derived from p300-deficient embryos displayed specific transcriptional defects and proliferated poorly. Surprisingly, p300 heterozygotes also manifested considerable embryonic lethality. Moreover, double heterozygosity for p300 and cbp was invariably associated with embryonic death. Thus, mouse development is exquisitely sensitive to the overall gene dosage of p300 and cbp. Our results provide genetic evidence that a coactivator endowed with histone acetyltransferase activity is essential for mammalian cell proliferation and development."

https://openalex.org/W2019931350,"Janus kinases (Jaks) play an important role in signal transduction via cytokine and growth factor receptors. A targeted inactivation of Jak2 was performed. Jak2-/- embryos are anemic and die around day 12.5 postcoitum. Primitive erythrocytes are found, but definitive erythropoiesis is absent. Compared to erythropoietin receptor-deficient mice, the phenotype of Jak2 deficiency is more severe. Fetal liver BFU-E and CFU-E colonies are completely absent. However, multilineage hematopoietic stem cells (CD34low, c-kit(pos)) can be found, and B lymphopoiesis appears intact. In contrast to IFNalpha stimulation, Jak2-/- cells do not respond to IFNgamma. Jak2-/- embryonic stem cells are competent for LIF signaling. The data provided demonstrate that Jak2 has pivotal functions for signal transduction of a set of cytokine receptors required in definitive erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2022819740,"Herein we report the generation of mice lacking the ubiquitously expressed Janus kinase, Jak1. Jak1-/- mice are runted at birth, fail to nurse, and die perinatally. Although Jak1-/- cells are responsive to many cytokines, they fail to manifest biologic responses to cytokines that bind to three distinct families of cytokine receptors. These include all class II cytokine receptors, cytokine receptors that utilize the gamma(c) subunit for signaling, and the family of cytokine receptors that depend on the gp130 subunit for signaling. Our results thus demonstrate that Jak1 plays an essential and nonredundant role in promoting biologic responses induced by a select subset of cytokine receptors, including those in which Jak utilization was thought to be nonspecific."

https://openalex.org/W2072386144,"Products of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) and Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) genes are essential for mammalian gonadogenesis prior to sexual differentiation. In males, SF-1 participates in sexual development by regulating expression of the polypeptide hormone Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS). Here, we show that WT1 -KTS isoforms associate and synergize with SF-1 to promote MIS expression. In contrast, WT1 missense mutations, associated with male pseudohermaphroditism in Denys-Drash syndrome, fail to synergize with SF-1. Additionally, the X-linked, candidate dosage-sensitive sex-reversal gene, Dax-1, antagonizes synergy between SF-1 and WT1, most likely through a direct interaction with SF-1. We propose that WT1 and Dax-1 functionally oppose each other in testis development by modulating SF-1-mediated transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1974103061,"Compared with vaccine delivery by injection, oral vaccines offer the hope of more convenient immunization strategies and a more practical means of implementing universal vaccination programs throughout the world. Oral vaccines act by stimulating the immune system at effector sites (lymphoid tissue) located in the gut. Genetic engineering has been used with variable success to design living and non-living systems as a means to deliver antigens to these sites and to stimulate a desired immune response1–4. More recently, plant biotechnology techniques have been used to create plants which contain a gene derived from a human pathogen; the resultant plant tissues will accumulate an antigenic protein encoded by the foreign DNA5–10. In pre-clinical trials, we found that antigenic proteins produced in transgenic plants retained immunogenic properties when purified; if injected into mice the antigen caused production of protein-specific antibodies6. Moreover, in some experiments, if the plant tissues were simply fed to mice, a mucosal immune response occurred7–10. The present study was conducted as a proof of principle to determine if humans would also develop a serum and/or mucosal immune response to an antigen delivered in an uncooked foodstuff."

https://openalex.org/W1965775500,Mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) transport newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases from the Golgi to prelysosomes and then return to the Golgi for another round of transport. We have identified a 47 kDa protein (TIP47) that binds selectively to the cytoplasmic domains of cation-independent and cation-dependent MPRs. TIP47 is present in cytosol and on endosomes and is required for MPR transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network in vitro and in vivo. TIP47 recognizes a phenylalanine/tryptophan signal in the tail of the cation-dependent MPR that is essential for its proper sorting within the endosomal pathway. These data suggest that TIP47 binds MPR cytoplasmic domains and facilitates their collection into transport vesicles destined for the Golgi.

https://openalex.org/W1987281935,"Synaptic vesicles can be coated in vitro in a reaction that is ARF-, ATP-, and temperature-dependent and requires synaptic vesicle membrane proteins. The coat is largely made up of the heterotetrameric complex, adaptor protein 3, recently implicated in Golgi-to-vacuole traffic in yeast. Depletion of AP3 from brain cytosol inhibits small vesicle formation from PC12 endosomes in vitro. Budding from washed membranes can be reconstituted with purified AP3 and recombinant ARF1. We conclude that AP3 coating is involved in at least one pathway of small vesicle formation from endosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2030614715,"Seven transmembrane domain receptors can be localized to different parts of the plasma membrane or to different intracellular compartments in a receptor-specific and cell type-specific fashion. We show here that the C. elegans genes odr-4 and odr-8 are required for localization of a subset of seven transmembrane domain odorant receptors to the cilia of olfactory neurons. Other cilia-signaling proteins, including ion channels, a G alpha protein, and even other receptor types, are localized via an odr-4/odr-8-independent pathway. odr-4 encodes a novel membrane protein that is expressed exclusively on intracellular membranes of chemosensory neurons, where it acts cell-autonomously to facilitate odorant receptor folding or localization."
https://openalex.org/W2047516322,"We describe the identification and characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ZIP2 gene, which encodes a novel meiosis-specific protein essential for synaptonemal complex formation. In the zip2 mutant, chromosomes are homologously paired but not synapsed. The Zip2 protein localizes to discrete foci on meiotic chromosomes; these foci correspond to sites of convergence between paired homologs that are believed to be sites of synapsis initiation. Localization of Zip2p requires the initiation of meiotic recombination. In a mutant defective in double-strand break repair, Zip2p colocalizes with proteins involved in double-strand break formation and processing. We propose that Zip2p promotes the initiation of chromosome synapsis and that localization of Zip2p to sites of interhomolog recombination ensures synapsis between homologous chromosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2335061472,"Deletions affecting the interval between the RB1 gene and marker D13S25 at band 13q14 are the most frequent genetic abnormalities of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and indicate the presence of a novel tumor suppressor gene in this region. In the current study, a high resolution physical map of fragments spanning one megabasepair (Mb) of genomic DNA at the critical 13q14 segment was constructed. To define the minimal region of loss within the RB1 and D13S25 interval, we screened 322 B-CLLs for deletions at either of the two loci. Thirty mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) were included in the analysis because we observed a 13q14 deletion pattern similar to B-CLL in this disease. The incidence of 13q14 deletions was 51% in B-CLL and 70% in MCL, respectively. No frequent loss of the BRCA2 gene at band 13q12 was found. Detailed deletion mapping at band 13q14 with probes from the RB1–D13S25 interval lead to the identification of a critical deletion region 400 kb in size. Within this region two segments were most frequently affected, one at D13S272 120 kb in size and another 240 kb distal of D13S272 80 kb in size. From these two segments expressed sequences were identified as candidates for the putative 13q14 tumor suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of B-CLL and MCL."

https://openalex.org/W2328395336,"The Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) LMP1 protein is frequently expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and is essential for the transforming effects of EBV. Analysis of LMP1 genes isolated from tumor biopsies has revealed considerable sequence variation including deletion of amino acids 343–352. Several studies have suggested that this sequence variation could enhance the transforming potential of LMP1. LMP1 has profound effects on cellular gene expression mediated in part through activation of the NF-κB transcription factor. In addition, LMP1 engages the TRAF signaling pathway resulting in the induction of EGFR expression. In this study, the LMP1 proteins derived from the laboratory strain B95-8 and the NPC strain C15 were analysed for their ability to activate NF-κB and also to induce expression of the EGFR. The data suggest that the C15-LMP1 protein activates NF-κB more efficiently and induces higher levels of the EGFR. Analysis of chimeric LMP1 proteins indicates that the amino terminal 181 amino acids of C15-LMP1 confer this increased signaling capability, and that deletion of amino acids 343–352 does not affect these properties. Finally, these data provide evidence that five amino acid changes within the transmembrane domain in the C15-LMP1 protein lead to enhanced NF-κB activation and EGFR induction."

https://openalex.org/W2328224885,"Signal transduction pathways involving the c-Raf protein kinase are frequently activated in tumor cells. We have addressed the relevance of this activation by a loss-of-function approach. An anti-sense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (ODN) specifically targeted against c-raf mRNA () was used to block c-Raf protein expression in four different cell lines derived from lung, cervical, prostate and colon carcinomas. Concomitant with the abrogation of c-Raf expression we observed the occurrence of classical apoptotic markers, including chromatin condensation, inter-nucleosomal DNA cleavage, annexin V binding and cleavage of PARP, which was followed by cell death, affecting most of the cell population. This induction of apoptosis occurred independent of the p53 status of the cell. These findings demonstrate that c-Raf can protect tumor cells from undergoing programmed cell death, and suggest that the interference with c-Raf expression or function by ODNs or specific drugs could represent a powerful means for improving the efficacy of anti-cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2314398811,"We show, in this study, that type I IFN induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21WAF1 in the human Burkitt lymphoma B cell-line Daudi and ensuing cell cycle arrest correlate with the terminal differentiation of these cells, and is ultimately followed by apoptosis and cell death. The expression of p21WAF1 paralleled the onset of G1 arrest and the reduction of surface IgM expression which was used as a marker of the differentiation response, and the IFN treated cells acquired a typical plasma cell-like morphology. The type II IFN IFNγ, which does not inhibit the growth of Daudi cells, did not induce the expression of p21WAF1, nor affect the expression of surface IgM. The induction of p21WAF1 which paralleled the inhibition of the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, pRB, was preceded by the strong reduction in c-myc levels. We propose that the coupled down-regulation of c-myc and induction of p21WAF1 may be crucial to the induction of differentiation and G1 arrest in Daudi cells by type I IFN. Growth arrest and differentiation was followed by apoptosis and cell death, and was accompanied by the induction of the activity of the apoptotic ICE-family protease CPP32. G1 arrest and differentiation followed by apoptotic cell death are characteristics of terminal differentiation. Thus, our data suggest that the induction of p21WAF1 and G1 arrest mediated by type I IFN in Daudi cells is part of terminal differentiation response in these cells, highlighting a role for type I IFN as B cell terminal differentiation factors."
