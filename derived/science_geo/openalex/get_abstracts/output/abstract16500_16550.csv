https://openalex.org/W1572011530,"Nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins, as occurs at an accelerated rate in diabetes, can lead to the formation of advanced glycosylation end products of proteins (AGEs), which can bind to endothelial cells, thereby altering cellular function in a manner which could contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic angiopathy. In this report, we describe the isolation of two endothelial cell surface-associated proteins which mediate, at least in part, the interaction of AGEs with endothelium. Based on pilot studies demonstrating AGE binding activity with comparable characteristics in bovine endothelial cell and lung extracts, the material from lung was sequentially subjected to chromatography on hydroxylapatite, fast protein liquid chromatography Mono S, and gel filtration. Two distinct polypeptides, approximately 35 and approximately 80 kDa, were purified to homogeneity, each of which bound AGEs as demonstrated by competitive binding assays using cellular binding proteins immobilized on a plastic surface. NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicated that the approximately 35-kDa protein was novel, whereas the NH2-terminal sequence of the approximately 80-kDa protein was identical to that of lactoferrin. Immunocytologic studies using polyclonal antibody prepared to each of the purified polypeptides demonstrated the presence of immunoreactive material on the surface of bovine endothelial cells maintained under serum-free conditions. Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopic studies with antibodies to the approximately 35- and approximately 80-kDa AGE-binding proteins conjugated to different size colloidal gold particles confirmed the presence of the target antigens on the cell surface and suggested that they were closely associated. IgG purified from polyclonal antisera to either the 35- or 80-kDa AGE-binding proteins blocked the binding of 125I-AGE-albumin to the cell surface. These results indicate that endothelial cells express specific cell surface molecules which mediate AGE-endothelial interaction. These polypeptides represent a novel class of cell surface acceptor molecules for glucose-modified proteins which may promote degradation and/or transcytosis of the ligand, and modulation of cellular function."
https://openalex.org/W2035633569,"Purified M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor and Gq/11 were coreconstituted in lipid vesicles. Addition of purified phospholipase C-beta 1 (PLC-beta 1) further stimulated the receptor-promoted steady-state GTPase activity of Gq/11 up to 20-fold. Stimulation depended upon receptor-mediated GTP-GDP exchange. Addition of PLC-beta 1 caused a rapid burst of hydrolysis of Gq/11-bound GTP that was at least 50-fold faster than in its absence. Thus, PLC-beta 1 stimulates hydrolysis of Gq/11-bound GTP and acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for its physiologic regulator, Gq/11. GTPase-stimulating activity was specific both for PLC-beta 1 and Gq/11. Such GAP activity by an effector coupled to a trimeric G protein can reconcile slow GTP hydrolysis by pure G proteins in vitro with fast physiologic deactivation of G protein-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1671728707,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent activator of antibacterial responses by macrophages. Following LPS stimulation, the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins is rapidly increased in macrophages, and this event appears to mediate some responses to LPS. We now report that two of these tyrosine phosphoproteins of 41 and 44 kDa are isoforms of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Each of these proteins was reactive with anti-MAP kinase antibodies and comigrated with MAP kinase activity in fractions eluted from a MonoQ anion-exchange column. Following LPS stimulation, column fractions containing the tyrosine phosphorylated forms of p41 and p44 exhibited increased MAP kinase activity. Inhibition of LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was accompanied by inhibition of MAP kinase activity. Additionally, induction of p41/p44 tyrosine phosphorylation and MAP kinase activity by LPS appeared to be independent of activation of protein kinase C, even though phorbol esters also induced these responses. These results demonstrate that LPS induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of at least two MAP kinase isozymes. Since MAP kinases appear to modulate cellular processes in response to extracellular signals, these kinases may be important targets for LPS action in macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W1511840890,"Coupling of the three alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2AR) subtypes to Gi and Gs was studied in membranes from transfected CHO cells. We observed that in the presence of low concentrations of the alpha 2AR agonist UK-14304, alpha 2C10 mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, whereas at high concentrations of agonist, alpha 2C10 mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. We considered that this biphasic response was due to the coupling of alpha 2C10 to both Gi and Gs. To isolate functional Gs and Gi coupling, cells were treated with pertussis toxin or cholera toxin in doses sufficient to fully ADP-ribosylate the respective G-proteins. Following treatment with cholera toxin, agonists elicited only alpha 2C10-mediated inhibition (approximately 50%) of adenylyl cyclase while after pertussis toxin treatment, agonists elicited only alpha 2C10-mediated stimulation (approximately 60%) of adenylyl cyclase. Incubation of membranes with antisera directed against the carboxyl-terminal portion of Gs alpha blocked this functional alpha 2AR.Gs coupling to the same extent as that found for beta 2AR.Gs coupling. In addition to functional Gs coupling, we also verified direct, agonist-dependent, physical coupling of alpha 2AR to Gs alpha. In agonist-treated membranes, an agonist-receptor-Gs alpha complex was immunoprecipitated with a specific alpha 2C10 antibody, and the Gs component identified by both western blots using Gs alpha antibody, and cholera toxin mediated ADP-ribosylation. Due to the differences in primary amino acid structure in a number of regions of the alpha 2AR subtypes, we investigated whether G-protein coupling was subtype-selective, using UK-14304 and cells with the same alpha 2AR expression levels (approximately 5 pmol/mg). Coupling to Gi was equivalent for alpha 2C10, alpha 2C4, and alpha 2C2: 53.4 +/- 8.8% versus 54.9 +/- 1.0% versus 47.6 +/- 3.5% inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, respectively. In marked contrast, distinct differences in coupling to Gs were found between the three alpha 2AR subtypes: stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was 57.9 +/- 6.3% versus 30.7 +/- 1.1% versus 21.8 +/- 1.7% for alpha 2C10, alpha 2C4, and alpha 2C2, respectively. Thus, alpha 2AR have the potential to couple physically and functionally to both Gi and Gs; for Gi coupling we found a rank order of alpha 2C10 = alpha 2C4 = alpha 2C2, while for Gs coupling, alpha 2C10 greater than alpha 2C4 greater than alpha 2C2."
https://openalex.org/W1536036565,"Gelsolin is an actin filament-severing and -capping protein that has profound effects on actin filament organization and assembly. It is activated by Ca2+ and inhibited by polyphosphoinositides (PPI). We have previously shown that PPI inhibit actin filament severing by the amino-terminal half of gelsolin and hypothesized that this is mediated through inhibition of actin filament side binding (by domains II-III of gelsolin), a requisite first step in severing. In this paper, we report that the subsequent step in severing, which is mediated by an actin monomer binding site located in domain I of gelsolin, is also regulated by PPI. We used deletional mutagenesis and a synthetic peptide to locate the sequence required for high affinity PPI binding in domain I. Our results show that the PPI-binding sequence has a basic charge distribution that is also present in the PPI-regulated actin filament side binding domain, and the two gelsolin PPI-binding sites have similar PPI-binding affinities. In addition, a similar motif is present in several other PPI-binding proteins, including a highly conserved region in the phospholipase C family. We propose that the sequences identified in gelsolin may represent a consensus for PPI binding in a variety of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1546499360,"Phosphatase inhibitors microcystin-LR, tautomycin, and okadaic acid caused contraction and increased 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC20) phosphorylation in Ca(2+)-free solutions in both phasic and tonic smooth muscle permeabilized with beta-escin, and inhibited the heavy meromyosin (HMM) phosphatase activity of smooth muscle homogenates with the same potency sequence: microcystin-LR greater than tautomycin greater than okadaic acid. The sensitivity to all three inhibitors was significantly higher, the half-times of relaxation and dephosphorylation were 4-6 times longer, and the HMM phosphatase and MLC20 kinase activity/smooth muscle cell wet weight was 2.0- and 1.9-fold lower in the tonic, femoral artery, than in the phasic, ileum or portal vein, smooth muscle. Preincubation with 0.2 microM inhibitor-2 decreased the HMM phosphatase activity by 35% in the ileum and by 60% in the femoral artery. The results suggest that the HMM phosphatases of smooth muscle have properties common to type 1 protein phosphatases, but are inhibited only partially by high concentrations of inhibitor-2, and that the lower HMM phosphatase activity of tonic smooth muscle may contribute to its greater sensitivity to phosphatase inhibitors and its slower rate of relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W1488746545,"The 72-kDa gelatinase/type IV collagenase, a metalloproteinase thought to play a role in metastasis and in angiogenesis, forms a noncovalent stoichiometric complex with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), a potent inhibitor of enzyme activity. To define the regions of the 72-kDa gelatinase responsible for TIMP-2 binding, a series of NH2- and COOH-terminal deletions of the enzyme were constructed using the polymerase chain reaction technique. The full-length and the truncated enzymes were expressed in a recombinant vaccinia virus mammalian cell expression system (Vac/T7). Two truncated enzymes ending at residues 425 (delta 426-631) and 454 (delta 455-631) were purified. Like the full-length recombinant 72-kDa gelatinase, both COOH-terminally truncated enzymes were activated with organomercurial and digested gelatin and native collagen type IV. In contrast to the full-length enzyme, delta 426-631 and delta 455-631 enzymes were less sensitive to TIMP-2 inhibition requiring 10 mol of TIMP-2/mol of enzyme to achieve maximal inhibition of enzymatic activity. The activated but not the latent forms of the delta 426-631 and delta 455-631 proteins formed a complex with TIMP-2 only when excess molar concentrations of inhibitor were used. We also expressed the 205-amino acid COOH-terminal fragment, delta 1-426, and found that it binds TIMP-2. In addition, a truncated version of the 72-kDa gelatinase lacking the NH2-terminal 78 amino acids (delta 1-78) of the proenzyme retained the ability to bind TIMP-2. These studies demonstrate that 72-kDa gelatinases lacking the COOH-terminal domain retain full enzymatic activity but acquire a reduced sensitivity to TIMP-2 inhibition. These data suggest that both the active site and the COOH-terminal tail of the 72-kDa gelatinase independently and cooperatively participate in TIMP-2 binding."
https://openalex.org/W2056019385,"Discovery and characterization of a new intermediate in Mu DNA transposition allowed assembly of the transposition machinery to be separated from the chemical steps of recombination. This stable intermediate, which accumulates in the presence of Ca2+, consists of the two ends of the Mu DNA synapsed by a tetramer of the Mu transposase. Within this stable synaptic complex (SSC), the recombination sites are engaged but not yet cleaved. Thus, the SSC is structurally related to both the cleaved donor and strand transfer complexes, but precedes them on the transposition pathway. Once the active protein-DNA complex is constructed, it is conserved throughout transposition. The participation of internal sequence elements and accessory factors exclusively during SSC assembly allows recombination to be controlled prior to the irreversible chemical steps."

https://openalex.org/W1908700199,"Intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells, or cholangiocytes, contribute to bile secretion in response to hormones, including secretin. However, the mechanism by which secretin stimulates ductular bile flow is unknown. Since recent data in nonhepatic epithelia have suggested a role for exocytosis in fluid secretion, we tested the hypothesis that secretin stimulates exocytosis by isolated cholangiocytes. Cholangiocytes were isolated from normal rat liver by a newly described method employing enzymatic digestion and mechanical disruption followed by immunomagnetic separation using specific monoclonal antibodies, and exocytosis was measured using a fluorescence unquenching assay employing acridine orange. Secretin caused a dose-dependent (10(-12)-10(-7) M) increase in acridine orange fluorescence by acridine orange-loaded cholangiocytes with a peak response at 10 min; the half-maximal concentration of secretin was 7 x 10(-9) M. The secretin effect was inhibited by preincubation of cholangiocytes with colchicine (30% inhibition, p less than 0.05) or trypsin (90% inhibition, p less than 0.001); no inhibition was seen with lumicolchicine and heat-inactivated trypsin. Cholecystokinin, insulin, and somatostatin had no effect on fluorescence of acridine orange-loaded cholangiocytes; secretin had no effect on fluorescence of acridine orange-loaded hepatocytes or hepatic endothelial cells. Exposure of isolated cholangiocytes to secretin at doses that stimulated exocytosis caused a dose-dependent increase in cyclic AMP levels (218% maximal increase, p less than 0.05); moreover, an analogue of cyclic AMP stimulated exocytosis by cholangiocytes. Secretin had no effect on intracellular calcium concentration using Fura-2-loaded cholangiocytes assessed by digitized video microscopy. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that secretin stimulates exocytosis by rat cholangiocytes. The effect is cell- and hormone-specific, dependent on intact microtubules, on a protein(s) on the external surface of cholangiocytes, and on changes in cellular levels of cyclic AMP. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that secretin-induced changes in bile flow may involve an exocytic process."
https://openalex.org/W2146488895,"Numerous cell surface glycoproteins from eukaryotic organisms including African trypanosomes and budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), are anchored to the lipid bilayer by a glycophospholipid, glycosylphosphatidylinositol, covalently linked to the carboxyl terminus of the protein via a phosphoethanolamine bridge. In this paper we describe metabolic labeling experiments aimed at identifying the biosynthetic origin of the ethanolamine residue in the phosphoethanolamine bridge. Using yeast mutants generated by disruption of the ethanolaminephosphotransferase (EPT1) and cholinephosphotransferase (CPT1) genes, we report data consistent with the proposal that the ethanolamine residue is derived from phosphatidylethanolamine."
https://openalex.org/W2086997710,"The E26 avian leukemia virus encodes a transcriptional activator-type oncoprotein consisting of Gag, Myb, and Ets domains, and transforms early erythroid cells as well as myeloblasts. Surprisingly, we have found that ""early erythroid"" transformants obtained in culture are multipotent, since they can be induced to differentiate into myeloblasts and eosinophils after superinfection with retroviruses containing kinase-type or ras oncogenes. In addition, TPA is an efficient inducer that generates predominantly eosinophils at low concentrations and myeloblasts at high concentrations. The determination process involves the complete extinction of erythroid/thrombocytic markers and the subsequent activation of myelomonocytic/eosinophilic properties, including the acquisition of specific growth factor requirements. ""Erythroleukemic"" cells from virus-infected animals were likewise found to be multipotent, making this a unique system to study the genesis of stem cell leukemias and the molecular basis of lineage commitment during hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W1541084827,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is an essential structural protein for the two triglyceride-rich lipoproteins synthesized by humans: chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins. Although much is known about the role of apoB in clearance of lipoproteins from the circulation, relatively little is known about its role in the assembly of nascent lipoproteins. Therefore, we have investigated the relationship between the length of various N-terminal apoB fragments and the characteristics of the lipoproteins with which these fragments were associated. After the addition of puromycin, HepG2 cells secreted a discrete series of C-terminally truncated apoB fragments on lipoprotein particles including apoB25, apoB29, apoB31, apoB33, apoB36, apoB38, apoB42, apoB45, apoB49, apoB51, apoB55, apoB70, and apoB80. Also, using plasmids encoding apoB26, apoB33, apoB37, apoB42, and apoB48, C-terminally truncated apoB fragments were expressed and secreted after transient transfection of HepG2 cells. Lipoproteins bearing the metabolically labeled apoB fragments were isolated from the cell culture media and characterized in terms of size, density, flotation coefficient, and composition. Lipoprotein radii, calculated from their flotation coefficients and buoyant densities, were used to derive the circumference of the non-polar core of each lipoprotein species. When plotted as a function of apoB size, core circumference defined a straight line of near-zero intercept. The slope of this line was approximately 1 A of core circumference/1 kDa of apoB molecular mass. A model for the mechanism of lipoprotein assembly in HepG2 cells, consistent with the concept that apoB size determines lipoprotein core circumference, is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2150301908,"The consensus DNA site for binding of the Escherichia coli catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) is 22 base pairs in length and is 2-fold symmetric: 5’AAATGT~ATCTAGATCACATTT-3~. Positions 4 to 8 of each half of the consensus DNA half-site are the most strongly conserved. In this report, we analyze the effects of substitution of DNA base pairs at positions 4 to 8, the effects of substitution of thymine by uracil and by 6-methylcytosine at positions 4, 6, and 8, and the effect of dam methylation of the 5’-GATC-3’ sequence at positions 7 to 10. All DNA sites having substitutions of DNA base pairs at positions 4 to 8 exhibit lower affinities for CAP than does the consensus DNA site, consistent with the proposal that the consensus DNA site is the ideal DNA site for CAP. Specificity for T:A at position 4 appears to be determined solely by the thymine 5-methyl group. Specificity for T:A at position 6 and specificity for A:T at position 8 appear to be determined in part, but not solely, by the thymine &methyl group. dam methylation has little effect on CAP-DNA complex formation. The thermodynamically defined consensus DNA site spans 28 base pairs. All, or nearly all, DNA determinants required for maximal affinity for CAP and for maximal thermodynamically defined CAP. DNA ion pair formation are contained within a 28-base pair DNA fragment that has the 22-base pair consensus DNA site at its center. The quantitative data in this report provide base-line thermodynamic data required for detailed investigations of amino acid-base pair and amino acid-phosphate contacts in this protein-DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W2100668681,"Reactive oxygen species do not activate isolated neutrophils, yet in vivo, such oxidants promote their adhesion to, and subsequent migration through, the vascular wall. We show human endothelial cells exposed to t-butylhydroperoxide shed large, sealed membrane vesicles that contained potent neutrophil agonists. This activity migrated on TLC like platelet-activating factor (PAF). Since neutrophils have a receptor for this phospholipid, which recognizes its unique characteristics including the short sn-2 acetyl residue, we examined the effect of PAF receptor antagonists and PAF acetylhydrolase on this activity. Structurally unrelated PAF receptor antagonists blocked neutrophil stimulation by vesicular phospholipids, and digestion with PAF acetylhydrolase, which is specific for short sn-2 residues, destroyed this activity. However, metabolic labeling, inhibition of synthesis, phospholipase A1 digestion, and high performance liquid chromatographic studies demonstrated that the vesicles did not contain PAF. Instead, the bioactivity migrated on high performance liquid chromatography like the phospholipids generated by oxidative fragmentation of synthetic arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine that we have shown previously (Smiley, P. L., Stremler, K. E., Prescott, S. M., Zimmerman, G. A., and McIntyre, T. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11104-11110) to stimulate neutrophils through their receptor for PAF. Thus, peroxide treatment of endothelial cells fragments cellular phosphatidylcholines, forming novel PAF-like phospholipids, and induces the shedding of membrane vesicles that contain these bioactive phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1572116252,"The poliovirus nonstructural proteins 2B, 2C, 2C3A, 2C3AB, 3A, and 3AB have been cloned and efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Each individual protein, or combinations of some of them, were cloned using polymerase chain reaction techniques and correspond to the genuine poliovirus protein plus an additional methionine. The system used to express them uses pET vectors containing the promoter of gene 10 of phage T7. Expression of protein 2C in BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells, which express the T7 lysozyme, is not toxic, and the bacteria synthesize this protein for several hours after induction. In contrast, the expression of proteins 2B, 3A, or 3AB is not tolerated by BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells which could make them only for a limited period of time. Protein 3AB was particularly toxic and induced a rapid lysis of the recombinant clone after its induction with isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside alone or with both isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside and rifampicin. Further analyses showed that 3AB induced profound modifications in membrane permeability to o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, labeled uridine, and nonpermeant translation inhibitors. Cloning and expression of proteins 2B, 3A, and 3AB in BL21 (DE3) cells that do not contain the T7 lysozyme lead to a more sustained expression of these proteins without detectable cell lysis. Changes in permeability to low molecular weight compounds such as radioactive uridine, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, and hygromycin B readily appeared upon induction of 2B, 3A, and 3AB. Our results indicate that the poliovirus nonstructural polypeptides 2B and 3A (or 3AB) are lytic for the bacteria. In fact, both proteins 2B and 3A contain hydrophobic domains in a potential amphipathic helix; this is one characteristic shared with a number of membrane-active peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1606582286,"A 60-kDa protein homologous to phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-alpha was purified to apparent homogeneity on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from the rough endoplasmic reticulum of rat liver through three sequential chromatographies on DEAE Toyopearl 650, AF-heparin Toyopearl 650M, and TSK gel G3000SW. The purified protein was monomeric, with an M(r) of 60,000. Eight types of protein were further separated from the 60-kDa protein and named ER60A-ER60H according to the order of their elution from a TSK gel DEAE-5PW column. They were essentially identical in terms of immunochemical properties and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. The partial amino acid sequence of ER60F showed homology to that of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-alpha. ER60A-ER60H showed no phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity. However, ER60A-ER60H catalyzed cleavage of themselves and the endoplasmic reticulum proteins protein disulfide-isomerase and calreticulin. Proteolytic degradation was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. These results indicate that ER60A-ER60H comprise a group of endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins and show thiol group-related proteolytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1526216096,"The x-ray crystal structure of a recombinant ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) encoded by the UBC1 gene of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana has been determined with the use of multiple isomorphous replacement techniques and refined at 2.4-A resolution by simulated annealing and restrained least-squares. This E2 is an alpha/beta protein, with four alpha-helices and a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. The NH2 and COOH termini, which may be important for interaction with other enzymes and substrates in the ubiquitin-conjugation pathway, are on the opposite side of the molecule from the cysteine residue that binds to the COOH terminus of ubiquitin. This structure should now allow for the rational analysis of E2 function by in vitro mutagenesis and facilitate the effective design of E2s with unique specificities or catalytic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2167128153,"Nuclear run-off experiments reveal that four distinct DNA domains, each of which contains a binding site for the liganded Ah receptor, can mediate the superinduction of transcription by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin plus cycloheximide. Superinduction requires substantial inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide. Gel retardation analyses of nuclear extracts and methylation protection studies in intact cells reveal no evidence for cycloheximide-sensitive protein-DNA interactions that might mediate the superinduction response. These observations suggest the existence of a labile protein(s) that acts to inhibit the function of the dioxin-responsive receptor/enhancer regulatory system via protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1546278128,"We have assigned the biosynthetic processing steps of cathepsin D to intracellular compartments which are involved in its transport to lysosomes in HepG2 cells. Cathepsin D was synthesized as a 51-kDa proenzyme. After formation of 51-55-kDa intermediates due to processing of N-linked oligosaccharides, procathepsin D was proteolytically processed to an intermediate 44-kDa and the mature 31-kDa enzyme. The intersection of the biosynthetic pathway of cathepsin D with the endocytic pathway was labeled with horseradish peroxidase and monitored biochemically by 3,3'-diaminobenzidine cytochemistry. Horseradish peroxidase was used either as a fluid-phase marker to label the entire endocytic pathway or conjugated to transferrin (Tf) to label endosomes only. Directly after biosynthesis cathepsin D was accessible neither to horseradish peroxidase nor Tf-horseradish peroxidase. Newly synthesized 51-55-kDa species of cathepsin D present in the trans-Golgi reticulum were accessible to both horseradish peroxidase and Tf-horseradish peroxidase. The accessibility of trans-Golgi reticulum to both endocytosed horseradish peroxidase and Tf-horseradish peroxidase was monitored by colocalization with a secretory protein, alpha 1anti-trypsin. The proteolytic processing of 51-55-kDa to 44-kDa cathepsin D occurred in compartments which were fully accessible to fluid-phase horseradish peroxidase. Tf-horseradish peroxidase had access to only 20% of 44-kDa cathepsin D while it had no access to 31-kDa cathepsin D. In contrast, the 31-kDa species was completely accessible to fluid-phase horseradish peroxidase. We conclude that proteolytic processing of 51-55-kDa to 44-kDa cathepsin D occurs in endosomes, whereas the processing of 44-31-kDa cathepsin D takes place in lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1619162897,"Calcineurin A was purified by calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus containing the cDNA of a rat calcineurin A isoform. The Sf9-expressed calcineurin A has a low basal phosphatase activity in the presence of EDTA (0.9 nmol/min/mg) which is stimulated 3-5-fold by Mn2+. Calmodulin increased the Mn2+ stimulated activity 3-5-fold. Bovine brain calcineurin B increased the A subunit activity 10-15-fold, and calmodulin further stimulated the activity of reconstituted A and B subunits 10-15-fold (644 nmol/min/mg). The Km of calcineurin A for 32P-RII pep (a peptide substrate (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE) for CaN), was 111 microM with or without calmodulin, and calmodulin increased the Vmax about 4-fold. The Km of reconstituted calcineurin A plus B for 32P-RII pep was 20 microM, and calmodulin increased the Vmax 18-fold without affecting the Km. CaN A467-492, a synthetic autoinhibitory peptide (ITSFEEAKGLDRINERMPPRRDAMP) from calcineurin, inhibited the Mn2+/calmodulin-stimulated activities of the reconstituted enzyme and the A subunit with IC50's of 25 microM and 90 microM, respectively. The reconstitution of the phosphatase activity of an expressed isoform of calcineurin A by purified B subunit and calmodulin may facilitate comparative studies of the regulation of calcineurin A activity by the B subunit and calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1587853416,"A rapid purification procedure produces milligram amounts of the T7 gene 4A' primase/helicase, 4B helicase, and the wild-type 4AB proteins expressed from the clones described in the accompanying paper (Rosenberg, A. H., Patel, S. S., Johnson, K. A., and Studier, F. W. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15005-15012). Purified 4A' protein (in which the wild-type methionine at amino acid 64 has been replaced by leucine to eliminate the 4B initiation codon) appears to be equivalent to the wild-type 4A protein in primase, helicase, and NTPase activities. Gel filtration chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of native proteins indicate that the 4A' and 4B proteins form homodimers and heterodimers in solution. Heterodimer formation presumably accounts for an observed 3-fold increase in the primase activity of 4A' upon addition of 4B that lacks primase activity of its own. Steady-state k(cat) and Km values for hydrolysis of the nucleoside triphosphates ATP, dATP, dTTP, and dGTP were measured for 4A', 4B, 4A'B (1:1), and wild-type 4AB (1:2) proteins. The dependence of the dNTPase activities on the concentration was hyperbolic, suggesting single or noncooperative binding sites, whereas ATPase activity was sigmoidal, suggesting more than one ATP binding site. The k(cat)/Km ratios for hydrolysis of the dNTPs by the four protein preparations were within a factor of 6 of each other. The 1:1 mixture of 4A'B had the highest k(cat)/Km ratios, with a preference for dATP and dTTP."
https://openalex.org/W1652317765,"We demonstrate in this report that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor from rat liver can be isolated by calmodulin affinity chromatography by binding in the presence of Ca2+ and elution with a Ca(2+)-chelating agent. The bulk of the EGF receptor is not eluted by a NaCl gradient in the presence of Ca2+. We ascertained the identity of the isolated receptor by immunoblot and immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal antibody against an EGF receptor from human origin. The purified receptor is autophosphorylated in tyrosine residues in an EGF-stimulated manner, and EGF-dependent phosphorylation of serine residues was also detected. Both the EGF and the transforming growth factor-alpha stimulate the tyrosine-directed protein kinase activity of the isolated receptor with similar affinities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that calmodulin inhibits the EGF-dependent tyrosine-directed protein kinase activity associated to the receptor in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibition is partially Ca2+ dependent and is not displaced by increasing the concentration of EGF up to an EGF/calmodulin ratio of 10 (mol/mol). In addition, calmodulin was phosphorylated in an EGF-stimulated manner in the presence of a basic protein (histone) as cofactor and in the absence, but not in the presence, of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1553966958,"Attempts to covalently link NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase to cytochrome P450 2B4 using a water-soluble carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylisopropyl)carbodiimide, were unsuccessful, despite the fact that under the same conditions about 30% of P450 2B4 could be covalently linked with cytochrome b5 in a functionally active complex (Tamburini, P. P., and Schenkman, J. B. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 11-15). This suggested that the functional electron transfer complex between P450 2B4 and reductase is not stabilized by electrostatic forces. Raising the ionic strength of the medium is disruptive to salt bridges and was used to further test whether P450 2B4 and the reductase form charge-pairing complexes. Instead of inhibiting electron transfer, high ionic strength increased the apparent fast phase rate constant and the fraction of P450 2B4 reduced in the fast phase. The possibility that electron transfer between NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and P450 2B4 is diminished by charge repulsion was examined. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Km of P450 2B4 for reductase was decreased 26-fold by increasing the ionic strength from 10 to 100 mM sodium phosphate without affecting the Vmax. The rate of benzphetamine N-demethylation also was increased by elevation of the ionic strength. Electron transfer from the reductase to other charged redox acceptors, e.g. cytochrome c and ferricyanide, was also stimulated by increased ionic strength. However, no similar stimulation was observed with the uncharged acceptor 1,4-benzoquinone. Polylysine, a polypeptide that binds to anionic sites, enhanced electron transfer from NADPH to ferricyanide and the apparent fast phase of reduction of cytochrome P450. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that charges on NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome P450 decrease the stability of the electron transfer complex."
https://openalex.org/W1591067042,"The role of internal stores and plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps in controlling [Ca2+]i during agonist stimulation and their regulation by agonists are not well understood. We report here measurements of intracellular ([Ca2+]i) and extracellular ([Ca2+]o) Ca2+ concentrations in agonist-stimulated pancreatic acini in an effort to directly address these questions. Stimulation of acini suspended in Ca(2+)-free or Ca(2+)-containing medium with Ca2+ mobilizing agonists resulted in a typical transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of internal Ca2+ pumps, inhibited the rate of [Ca2+]i reduction after agonist stimulation by approximately 40%. Under the same conditions, thapsigargin had no effect on the rate of the unidirectional Ca2+ efflux across the plasma membrane as revealed by measurements of [Ca2+]o. These findings suggest that internal Ca2+ pumps actively remove Ca2+ from the cytosol during continued agonist stimulation. The correlation between the reduction in [Ca2+]i and the increase in [Ca2+]o showed that Ca2+ efflux from cells stimulated with agonist and thapsigargin represent Ca2+ efflux across the plasma membrane. Inhibition of cells exposed to agonist and thapsigargin with a specific antagonist sharply reduced the rates of the [Ca2+]i decrease and the accompanied [Ca2+]o increase. Hence, at comparable [Ca2+]i, Ca2+ efflux from stimulated cells was about 3-fold faster than that from resting cells, indicating that agonists directly activate the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. To study the role of [Ca2+]i increase in plasma membrane Ca2+ pump activation the acini were loaded with 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxyethane-N,N,N',N')-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), and [Ca2+]o was measured during agonist stimulation. Surprisingly, although BAPTA completely prevented the increase in [Ca2+]i, Ca2+ efflux rate was reduced by only 34%. These findings provide the first evidence for Ca(2+)-independent activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump by Ca2+ mobilizing agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1604889021,"Plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is cleared rapidly in vivo by the liver. Previous studies with the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 have identified a clearance system for t-PA modulated by plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). In the present study, a rat hepatoma cell line MH1C1 is shown to contain a PAI-1-independent t-PA clearance system. At 4 degrees C, binding of 125I-t-PA to MH1C1 cells was rapid, specific, and saturable. Scatchard analysis of the binding data yielded a mean estimate of 105,000 high affinity binding sites per cell (Kd = 4.1 nM). When the bound ligand was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the majority (about 90%) of the specific binding was in the form of uncomplexed 125I-t-PA. This is in contrast to HepG2 cells in which specific binding was mainly in the form of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 complex. When availability of matrix-associated PAI-1 was blocked by preincubation with anti-PAI-1 antibody or removed by elastase treatment, specific 125I-t-PA binding to MH1C1 cells was unaffected, whereas most of the specific 125I-t-PA binding to HepG2 cells was abolished. Furthermore, when the active site of t-PA was inactivated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate, the diisopropyl fluorophosphate-t-PA specifically competed for binding of 125I-t-PA to MH1C1 cells, but failed to block specific 125I-t-PA binding to HepG2 cells. At 37 degrees C, PAI-1-independent t-PA binding to MH1C1 cells was followed by ligand uptake and degradation with kinetics similar to that seen in HepG2 cells. Chemical cross-linking of t-PA to MH1C1 cells revealed a specific t-PA binding protein with a molecular mass of about 500,000 daltons. Ligand-receptor complexes generated by chemical cross-linking were immunoprecipitable by anti-t-PA antibody but not by anti-PAI-1 antibody, further supporting the finding that binding of t-PA to MH1C1 cells is PAI-1-independent."
https://openalex.org/W1533973125,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) binds to two structurally unrelated transmembrane proteins on the surface of PC-12 cells, a 75-kDa glycoprotein with a short cytoplasmic sequence, and the trk protooncogene (pp140c-trk), a protein tyrosine kinase activated by NGF. Immediately after binding to cells, NGF induces changes in serine/threonine phosphorylation of several proteins. We have explored the relative roles of these two NGF binding proteins in mediating the activation of two intracellular kinases that may be responsible for some of these phosphorylations. The raf-1 protooncogene is a serine/threonine kinase activated by several growth factors and oncogenic proteins. Treatment of PC-12 cells with NGF increases the serine and threonine phosphorylation of raf-1 in an anti-raf-1 immunoprecipitate kinase assay. This increased phosphorylation observed in vitro is dose-dependent and transient and is accompanied by the NGF-dependent shift in the mobility of immunoblotted raf-1 on SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, an effect thought to reflect phosphorylation. NGF-dependent activation of raf-1 is not dependent on protein kinase C, since prolonged exposure to phorbol esters under conditions that cause down-regulation of cellular protein kinase C activity has no effect on the NGF response. Expression of pp140c-trk in 3T3 fibroblasts (3T3-c-trk), as evidenced by cross-linking of 125I-NGF to the 140-kDa protein, permits the NGF-dependent activation of raf-1 kinase, detected in the immunoprecipitate kinase assay, anti-raf immunoblot shift on gel electrophoresis, and incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into the raf-1 protein. The concentration dependence of raf-1 activation is identical in 3T3-c-trk and PC-12 cells, despite the absence of the 75-kDa NGF binding protein in 3T3-c-trk cells. NGF is without effect in untransfected 3T3 cells or in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing p75, although raf-1 is present in these cells. Similarly, the NGF-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is detected in 3T3-c-trk cells, but not in untransfected 3T3 or Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing p75. As described for raf-1 activation, the NGF dose responses for MAP kinase activation in 3T3-c-trk and PC-12 cells are virtually superimposable. These data indicate that the activation of these two serine/threonine kinases by NGF is mediated solely by binding to and activating the pp140c-trk receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1480948940,"Analysis of vaccinia topoisomerase mutants that are impaired in DNA relaxation has allowed the identification of amino acid residues required for the transesterification step of catalysis. Missense mutations of wild-type residues Gly-132----Asp and Arg-223----Gln rendered the protein inert in formation of the covalent enzyme-DNA complex and hence completely inactive in DNA relaxation. Mutations of Thr-147----Ile and Gly-132----Ser caused severe defects in covalent adduct formation that correlated with the extent of inhibition of relaxation. None of these point mutations had an effect on noncovalent DNA binding sufficient to account for the defect in relaxation. Deletion of amino- or carboxyl-terminal portions of the polypeptide abrogated noncovalent DNA binding. Two distinct topoisomerase-DNA complexes were resolved by native gel electrophoresis. One complex, which was unique to those proteins competent in covalent adduct formation, contained topoisomerase bound to the 5'-portion of the incised DNA strand. The 3'-segment of the cleaved strand had dissociated spontaneously. This complex was isolated and shown to catalyze transfer of the covalently bound DNA to a heterologous acceptor oligonucleotide, thereby proving that the covalent adduct between protein and duplex DNA is a true intermediate in strand breakage and reunion. The role of the active site region of eukaryotic topoisomerase in determining sensitivity or resistance to camptothecin was examined by converting the active site region of the resistant vaccinia enzyme (SKRAY274) to that of the drug-sensitive yeast enzyme (SKINY). The SKINY mutation did not alter the resistance of the vaccinia enzyme to the cleavage-enhancing effects of camptothecin."
https://openalex.org/W1571417467,"Ubiquitin is a highly conserved, 76-amino acid, eukaryotic protein. Its widely accepted role as a proteolytic cofactor depends on its unique ability to covalently ligate to other cellular proteins. While there is good evidence for the existence of such ubiquitinated proteins in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments, relatively little is known about the presence of free ubiquitin and ubiquitinated proteins in other subcellular compartments. This is especially true of higher plants, which have not previously been the subject of extensive biochemical subcellular localizations of ubiquitinated proteins. We extracted cell wall proteins and purified nuclei, vacuoles, chloroplasts, and microsomes from chlorophyllous tissues of Arabidopsis. Immunoblot analyses were used to compare the profiles of ubiquitinated proteins from purified subcellular fractions to those from unfractionated extracts. Purified nuclei contained, in addition to a complex mixture of high molecular mass ubiquitinated proteins, a strongly immunoreactive 28-kDa protein. In the apoplastic extract, we did not detect any ubiquitinated proteins enriched above the background level of those due to cytosolic contamination. Vacuoles appeared to contribute significantly to the ubiquitinated proteins present in the whole protoplast extract. At least three high molecular mass ubiquitinated proteins were unique to the vacuolar extract. Chloroplast stromal proteins did not react specifically with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. When microsomal ubiquitinated proteins were compared to those found in a whole protoplast extract, a distinct pattern was evident. Microsomal ubiquitinated proteins were not visible in the 10,000 x g supernatant used to prepare the 100,000 x g pellet, indicating that they were probably low abundance proteins in the protoplast extract."
https://openalex.org/W1594220199,"To identify a receptor binding site of human interleukin-6 (IL-6), we created a library of IL-6 variants with single amino acid substitutions in the last 15 residues (171-185) in the COOH terminus of IL-6. Twenty-seven IL-6 variants were tested for biological activity on a human hepatoma and a mouse hybridoma cell line. Most variants were additionally tested in a receptor binding assay using a human myeloma cell line. Several single amino acid substitutions in the COOH terminus of IL-6 were found to decrease biological activity significantly. This is especially seen in variants with amino acid substitutions that alter the postulated amphipathical alpha-helix structure between residues 178 and 183. The two highly conserved Arg residues at positions 180 and 183 seem to play a very important role in biological activity. The loss of biological activity in all inactive variants is completely paralleled by a decrease of IL-6 receptor binding, as determined by competition binding experiments. One mutant (Leu171) displayed a higher activity on human cells and a higher binding affinity to the receptor and can be considered an IL-6 agonist. It is concluded that the amphipathical alpha-helix structure in the COOH terminus of IL-6 is critical for ligand receptor interaction. Furthermore, the region between residues Ser178 and Arg183 (Ser-Leu-Arg-Ala-X-Arg) is identified as a receptor binding site in the COOH terminus of human IL-6."
https://openalex.org/W2171479279,"The mechanism of inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis by okadaic acid was investigated in suspension cultures of isolated rat hepatocytes. Cells were pulsed with [methyl-3H]choline and chased in the absence or presence of 1 microM okadaic acid for up to 120 min. Phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis was inhibited after 15 min of chase. To see if okadaic acid altered the degree of phosphorylation of cytidylyltransferase (CT), hepatocytes were incubated with 32P(i) and chased in the absence or presence of okadaic acid. Okadaic acid caused a rapid (within 15 min) increase in the phosphorylation state of the cytosolic enzyme. Two-dimensional peptide map analysis revealed an increase in the phosphorylation of several peptides in okadaic acid-treated hepatocytes compared with controls. After 15 min of incubation of hepatocytes with okadaic acid, membrane CT activity was decreased and a corresponding increase in cytosolic CT activity was observed. In hepatocytes incubated with okadaic acid and oleate a correlation between membrane CT activity, diacylglycerol level, and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis was observed. These data suggest that the concentration of diacylglycerol is responsible for the increase in membrane CT activity and subsequently phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in oleate-treated cells. We postulate that the okadaic acid-induced decrease in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis is due to an increase in the phosphorylation state of CT which promotes a translocation of CT activity from the membranes to the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1589156173,"The aminoglycoside neomycin has recently been found to affect certain platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) responses in C3H/10T1/2 C18 fibroblasts. Using porcine aortic endothelial cells transfected with PDGF alpha- or beta-receptors, we explored the possibility that neomycin interferes with the interaction between the different PDGF isoforms and their receptors. We found that neomycin (5 mM) inhibited the binding of 125I-PDGF-BB to the alpha-receptor with only partial effect on the binding of 125I-PDGF-AA; in contrast, the binding of 125I-PDGF-BB to the beta-receptor was not affected by the aminoglycoside. Scatchard analyses showed that neomycin (5 mM) decreased the number of binding sites for PDGF-BB on alpha-receptor-expressing cells by 87%. Together with cross-competition studies with 125I-labeled PDGF homodimers, the effect of neomycin indicates that PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB bind to both common and unique structures on the PDGF alpha-receptor. Neomycin specifically inhibited the autophosphorylation of the alpha-receptor by PDGF-BB, with less effect on the phosphorylation induced by PDGF-AA and no effect on the phosphorylation of the beta-receptor by PDGF-BB. Thus, neomycin is a PDGF isoform- and receptor-specific antagonist that provides a possibility to compare the signal transduction pathways of alpha- and beta-receptors in cells expressing both receptor types. This approach was used to show that activation of PDGF beta-receptors by PDGF-BB mediated a chemotactic response in human fibroblasts, whereas activation of alpha-receptors by the same ligand inhibited chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W1661428152,"Human erythrocytes rapidly convert vitamin B6 to pyridoxal-P and contain soluble phosphatase activity which dephosphorylates pyridoxal-P at a pH optimum of 6-6.5. This phosphatase was purified 51,000-fold with a yield of 39% by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-200, hydroxylapatite, and reactive yellow 86-agarose. Sephacryl S-200 chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme was a dimer with a molecular mass of approximately 64 kDa. The phosphatase required Mg2+ for activity. It specifically catalyzed the removal of phosphate from pyridoxal-P, pyridoxine-P, pyridoxamine-P, 4-pyridoxic acid-P, and 4-deoxypyridoxine-P at pH 7.4. Nucleotide phosphates, phosphoamino acids, and other phosphorylated compounds were not hydrolyzed significantly nor were they effective inhibitors of the enzyme. The phosphatase showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with its substrates. It had a Km of 1.5 microM and a Vmax of 3.2 mumol/min/mg with pyridoxal-P. The Vmax/Km was greatest with pyridoxal-P greater than 4-pyridoxic acid-P greater than pyridoxine-P greater than pyridoxamine-P. The phosphatase was competitively inhibited by the product, inorganic phosphate, with a Ki of 0.8 mM, and weakly inhibited by pyridoxal. It was also inhibited by Zn2+, fluoride, molybdate, and EDTA, but was not inhibited by levamisole, L-phenylalanine, or L(+)-tartrate. These properties of the purified enzyme suggest that it is a unique acid phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates vitamin B6-phosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1517829295,"A new molecule, type XIV collagen, with domains homologous to type IX and XII collagens has been recently discovered in pepsin extracts of fetal bovine tissues (Dublet, B., and van der Rest, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6853-6858). In the present study, we describe the purification and the characterization of the intact native form of this newly discovered collagen. By using only two chromatographic steps we were able to obtain pure type XIV collagen. Furthermore, minor modifications of the protocol allowed us to perform the simultaneous large scale purification of type XII and type XIV collagens from the same tissue. Intact type XIV collagen migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as two bands of 220 and 290 kDa (reducing conditions). After collagenase treatment, a single band of 190 kDa is observed, which represents the large non-collagenous domain of the molecule (NC3). Rotary shadowing electron micrographs of intact type XIV collagen show a cross-shaped structure formed by a thin tail attached through a central globule to three identical fingers. These properties are similar to those previously described for intact chicken type XII collagen (Dublet, B., Oh, S., Sugrue, S. P., Gordon, M. K., Gerecke, D. R., Olsen, B. R., and van der Rest, M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13150-13156), but the two molecules are different gene products and have charge and glycosylation differences. Finally, we show that the three chains of purified type XIV collagen have an apparent molecular mass of approximately 220 kDa and are not cross-linked to each other by bonds other than disulfide bridges. The same observation was made for type XII collagen. In both cases, the 290-kDa migrating band in SDS-PAGE is due to incomplete denaturation in electrophoresis sample buffer in the absence of urea."
https://openalex.org/W1530827272,"To examine the role of protein phosphatases in skeletal muscle differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with okadaic acid, a potent in vitro inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A which regulate various cellular events in intact cells. We now show that okadaic acid treatment of the mouse myoblast C2C12 cell line reversibly altered the morphology of the cells and blocked differentiation. At a molecular level, it extinguished expression of the myogenic determination genes, MyoD1 and myogenin, but induced the expression of an inhibitor of differentiation, Id. Analysis of the MyoD1 promoter showed that inhibition of MyoD1 expression by okadaic acid occurs at the transcriptional level. These changes occur 10-20 h after okadaic acid treatment. However, within 1 h of treatment the ability of muscle extracts to support a specific MyoD-dependent gel mobility shift using a MyoD DNA binding site is lost. These data suggest that protein phosphatases play an important role during myogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1558400446,"We examined the protective effect of cellular superoxide dismutase against extracellular hydrogen peroxide in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. 51Cr-labeled cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide generated by glucose oxidase/glucose. Glucose oxidase caused a dose-dependent increase of 51Cr release. Pretreatment with diethyldithiocarbamate enhanced injury induced by glucose oxidase, corresponding with the degree of inhibition of endogenous superoxide dismutase activity. Inhibition of cellular superoxide dismutase by diethyldithiocarbamate was not associated either with alteration of other antioxidant defenses or with potentiation of nonoxidant injury. Enhanced glucose oxidase damage by diethyldithiocarbamate was prevented by chelating cellular iron. Inhibition of cellular xanthine oxidase neither prevented lysis by hydrogen peroxide nor diminished enhanced susceptibility by diethyldithiocarbamate. These results suggest that, in cultured endothelial cells: 1) cellular superoxide is involved in mediating hydrogen peroxide-induced damage; 2) superoxide, which would be generated upon exposure to excess hydrogen peroxide independently of cellular xanthine oxidase, promotes the Haber-Weiss reaction by initiating reduction of stored iron (Fe3+) to Fe2+; 3) cellular iron catalyzes the production of a more toxic species from these two oxygen metabolites; 4) cellular superoxide dismutase plays a critical role in preventing hydrogen peroxide damage by scavenging superoxide and consequently by inhibiting the generation of the toxic species."
https://openalex.org/W1555374589,"T7 gene 4, which is required for DNA replication, specifies two proteins whose coding sequences overlap in the same reading frame: the 4A protein, a 566-amino acid primase/helicase, and the 4B protein, a 503-amino acid helicase whose initiation codon is the 64th codon of the 4A protein. To study better the individual functions of these two overlapping proteins, we made clones that express both 4A and 4B proteins, only 4B protein, or only what we refer to as the 4A' protein, in which methionine 64 is replaced by leucine, thereby eliminating the 4B initiation codon. These clones provide considerably more gene 4 protein for biochemical analysis than do infected cells. They can also be used to isolate and propagate T7 gene 4 deletion mutants, and we have made T7 mutants which lack all gene 4 coding sequences, or which express 4A' protein but no 4B protein, or 4B protein but no 4A protein. Analysis of these phage mutants shows that 4A' protein without any 4B protein can support essentially normal replication and growth, whereas 4B protein without any 4A protein supports little replication or growth. Apparently, the primase activity of the 4A protein is essential for replication, but the 4B protein is dispensable, presumably because the 4A protein also supplies helicase activity. The mutation at amino acid 64 of 4A' appears to have little effect on 4A function. The rate of replication during normal T7 infection appears to be limited by the amount of gene 4 protein, but too high a level of either 4A or 4B protein is inhibitory to growth."

In the presence of ferrous iron and oxygen, the truncated protein readily generated similar amounts of tyrosyl free radical as the intact protein. However, the radical showed differences in EPR characteristics in the truncated protein compared with the normal one, indicating an altered structural arrangement of the radical relative to the iron center.

The gene for Factor X spans 27 kilobases and is located on chromosome 13, in close proximity to the gene encoding Factor VII. Expression of Factor X is restricted to the liver. We have characterized the human Factor X promoter by mapping the start sites of transcription and carrying out a functional analysis of the promoter. The first 279 base pairs (bp) of 5'-flanking sequence upstream from the first AUG are sufficient to confer maximal promoter activity in HepG2 cells. Protein-binding sites within the 279-bp fragment are defined using gel mobility shift assays. Mutagenesis of two specific sequences within the 279-bp fragment (CCAAT at -120 to -116, and ACTTTG at -56 to -51), results in loss of ability to bind proteins from a HepG2 nuclear extract, and profound reduction in promoter activity of the 279-bp fragment. We conclude that these two protein-binding sites are critical for the activity of the Factor X promoter."

Deficiency of this enzyme results in phenylketonuria, a common genetic disorder of amino acid metabolism that causes severe mental retardation. In primates, PAH is expressed specifically in the liver, while in rodents PAH activity is also present in kidney, although at a much lower level. A 9-kilobase genomic DNA fragment at the 5' end of the hPAH gene (hPAH) was fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The hPAH/CAT minigene was used to generate multiple transgenic mouse lines. In all expressing lines, CAT activity was detected predominantly in the liver and at much lower levels in the kidney. By immunohistochemical staining, CAT expression was localized to hepatocytes and renal epithelial cells, both of which also express the endogenous mouse PAH enzyme. Furthermore, both the transgene and the endogenous mouse PAH were activated at about the same stage of embryonic development in the mouse liver. These results suggest that the 9-kilobase DNA fragment flanking the 5' end of the human PAH gene contains all the necessary cis-acting elements to direct tissue- and developmental-specific expression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1509079182,"The pH- and temperature-dependent changes in the coordination sphere of the heme c group of N alpha-acetyl microperoxidase-8 (Ac-MP-8) have been studied by examining its optical, resonance Raman, electron paramagnetic resonance, and magnetic circular dichroism spectra. An optical titration indicates that Ac-MP-8 exists in three major ionization forms over the pH 1-12 range that are linked by pK alpha values of approximately 3 and 9. The acid form that is present at pH 1.5 exists as a mixture of five- and six-coordinate high-spin species and most likely has water or buffer ions as axial ligand(s). On titration to pH 7, the His18 residue is deprotonated and becomes the proximal ligand to the iron to give a six-coordinate neutral form that has water as the sixth ligand. This form exists in a thermal high-spin intermediate-spin state equilibrium. On raising the pH to 10, an alkaline form is generated which is predominantly a five-coordinate high-spin species. It is formed by ionization of the proximal His18 residue to its imidazolate form with concomitant dissociation of the water ligand at the sixth site. At concentrations of Ac-MP-8 greater than 10 microM, some six-coordinate low-spin species are formed that are attributed to a dimer in which a His18 residue from a second molecule of Ac-MP-8 coordinates to the sixth site of another to give a bis-His complex. Raising the pH to 11.5 does not produce an appreciable amount of the six-coordinate complex with hydroxide as the sixth ligand. These studies show that Ac-MP-8 is a good water-soluble model for the peroxidases that exhibits minimal aggregation at concentrations below 10 microM in the neutral and alkaline pH regions."
https://openalex.org/W1536622485,"We developed an assay to directly measure the ligand binding properties of the cloned human erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). The cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of the human EpoR was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and ligated into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX3X. Synthesis in Escherichia coli was induced and a soluble glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, EREx, was purified by erythropoietin affinity chromatography. Purified EREx was bound to GSH agarose beads and used in a solid phase ligand binding assay. Specific binding of 125I-erythropoietin to EREx beads was demonstrated. A single affinity class (Kd = 1.5 nM) of the binding site was evident on Scatchard analysis. The Kd of this site is quantitatively equivalent to that of the low affinity cellular binding site. Kinetic analysis of ligand binding to EREx revealed both the on and off rates to be rapid, with t1/2 of 60 and 40 s, respectively. EREx ligand binding exhibits no obvious metal ion dependence or cross-competition by other hemopoietins. Antibodies to EREx block the binding of erythropoietin to the cellular EpoR. We conclude that the 66-kDa EpoR protein is capable of specific ligand binding and that no covalent modifications or associated molecules are required for this interaction. We speculate that the high affinity cellular binding site (Kd less than 0.2 nM) results from the interaction of the EpoR with another molecule, either additional EpoR or associated subunits, that decreases the ligand off rate."

In E1.7, a nuclear protein from HuH-7 hepatoma cells binds to an AT-rich sequence, GTTACTAATTGAC. Competition gel mobility shift assays suggested that this protein is HNF-1, which regulates the promoter of the albumin gene and several other liver-specific genes. A 60-base pair E1.7 fragment carrying the AT-rich sequence stimulates a heterologous (alpha-fetoprotein) promoter in a dose-dependent manner. In E6, a HuH-7 nuclear protein binds to a GT-rich sequence, TGTTTGGC.A 27-base pair E6 fragment carrying this sequence is able to stimulate the SV40 promoter in an orientation-independent manner. An alteration of this sequence by site-specific mutagenesis resulted in the loss of transcriptional activity as well as binding to the HuH-7 nuclear protein. Competition gel mobility shift assays showed that homologous elements exist in the albumin promoter. These results show that the promoter and enhancer of the human albumin gene are regulated by two common transcription factors through two shared cis-acting elements, one AT-rich and the other GT-rich."
https://openalex.org/W1776463049,"The retinoblastoma gene product (pRB) participates in regulating mammalian cell replication. The mechanism responsible for pRB's growth regulatory activity is uncertain. However, pRB is known to bind viral transforming proteins including the papilloma virus E7 protein, cellular proteins, and DNA. pRB contains a critical domain termed the which is required for binding activities. This binding pocket contains 8 cysteine residues. A naturally occurring mutation affecting one of these cysteines is known to eliminate pRB's protein and DNA binding activities. To investigate the cysteine residues in pRB's binding pocket, each residue was mutated to alanine, phenylalanine, or serine. These mutant genes were used to prepare pRBs harboring specific amino acid substitutions. Individual mutations at positions 407, 553, 666, and 706 depressed pRB binding to E7 protein, DNA, and a conformation-specific anti-pRB antibody, XZ133. Combinations of these inhibitory mutations exhibited additive inhibitory effects on pRB's binding properties. Mutations at positions 438, 489, 590, 712, and 853 did not affect pRB binding to E7 protein, DNA, or the XZ133 antibody. Combination of these five neutral mutations yielded a pRB species with full E7 protein, DNA, and XZ133 binding activities. These studies indicate that the cysteine residues at positions 407, 553, 666, and 706 contribute to the E7 protein and DNA binding properties of pRB and appear to do so by maintaining pRB's normal conformation."

Thapsigargin (Tg) caused a sustained increase in Cai, the rate of rise being slower but the magnitude greater than with the agonists lysylbradykinin and ATP. Tg caused an irreversible change such that even after it was removed Cai was dependent on the ambient calcium concentration, consistent with the hypothesis that Ca2+ entry is controlled by the state of the intracellular stores. Calcium entry after Tg was not modified by nimodipine, omega-conotoxin, or BAY K8644 but could be blocked by low concentrations (0.5 mM) of La3+. High concentrations of La3+ (2 mM) caused an increase in the response to Tg, suggesting that membrane ATPase exerts a major Cai lowering effect. Intracellular Ca2+ ion chelation with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid significantly blunted the response to Tg. Finally, Mn2+ entry rate into epithelial cells was doubled by Tg. In spite of the evidence that Tg raises Cai to values greater and for longer than calcium requiring agonists only the latter affected transepithelial transport processes. It is shown that Tg neither affects transepithelial sodium transport nor chloride conductance, both of which increase in response to lysylbradykinin or ATP. It is concluded that spatio-temporal patterns of Cai increase after Tg and other agonists are different."
https://openalex.org/W1544907918,"Previous results indicate that the external glycoprotein gp51 of bovine leukemia virus plays an important role in the process of cell fusion induced by bovine leukemia virus (Bruck, C., Mathot, S., Portetelle, D., Berte, C., Franssen, J. D., Herion, P., and Burny, A. (1982) Virology 122, 342-352; Voneche, V., Portetelle., D., Kettmann, R., Willems, L., Limbach, K., Paoletti, E., Ruysschaert, J. M., Burny, A., and Brasseur, R. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 3810-3814) and suggest that a region encompassing residues 23 and 25 of gp51 is involved in this process (Portetelle, D., Couez, D., Bruck, C., Kettmann, R., Mammerickx, M., Van der Maaten, M., Brasseur, R., and Burny, A. (1989) Virology 169, 27-33; Mamoun, R., Morisson, M., Rebeyrotte, N., Busetta, B., Couez, D., Kettmann, R., Hospital, M., and Guillemain, B. (1990) J. Virol. 64, 4180-4188). X-ray diffraction studies performed on envelope glycoproteins of influenza virus indicate that the NH2-terminal part of the external glycoprotein lies very close to the fusion peptide. The same overall structure seems to exist in human immunodeficiency virus as suggested by site-directed mutagenesis followed by syncytia induction assays. Our theoretical studies indicate that a segment expanding between residues 19 and 27 of gp51 probably adopts an amphipathic beta-strand structure. We hypothesize that the amphipathic 19-27 structure of gp51 plays an important role in the process of membrane fusion by interacting with the fusion peptide or with another region of gp30. Mutational analysis disrupting the amphipathy of the 19-27 region strongly altered the fusogenic capacity of the gp51-gp30 complex."
