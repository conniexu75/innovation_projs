The strengths and limitations of these spectroscopic techniques often determine the viability of scientific investigations. The unique properties of degenerate four-wave mixing, a nonlinear optical technique, have recently been found to provide powerful capabilities for a wide range of applications."

Although the comet showed the usual emissions of Ol and NH(2), it did not display any hint of C(2) or CN emission. The comet is depleted in C(2) by at least a factor of 100 and in CN by a factor of 25 relative to typical comets. If comets originate from interstellar clouds, Yanaka (1988r) could be an interloper from a cloud of different composition. If Yanaka (1988r) was formed within our solar system, the solar nebula was less uniform than assumed by most present models of formation."

The radio observations have quite definitely indicated that down to the 9th magnitude, corresponding to particles approximately 1 mm in diameter, meteors are members of the solar system and do not come from interstellar space."

understanding of the biology of mental illness. Alongside
important social and psychological factors, the biology
of psychiatric disorders plays an important role in their
development and prognosis. The inclusion of this chapter
in this report reflects the need to widen public awareness
of the quality and breadth of scientific work currently
under way to help those suffering from mental illness.
There is a stark mismatch between the funding for such
research and the considerable cost of these disorders to
our society, exacerbated by the recent disengagement of
many pharmaceutical companies from research related to
brain disorders. Translating the promising findings presented
here into improved clinical care requires this mismatch to
be addressed urgently. One way of doing this is by building
bridges between the diverse fields involved in the common
pursuit of the promotion of public mental health, which is
one of the aims of this chapter.
It would be impossible to summarise the entire field of
biological psychiatry for such a chapter. Instead, we have
adopted a ‘horizon-scanning’ approach to demonstrate the
variety of techniques used in this area, and to highlight a
few examples that are more likely to have a rapid impact
on patients’ care. The chapter is divided, by technique, into
sections covering neuroimaging, neuropsychology, genetics,
blood-based biomarkers and animal and cellular models of
disease. Some of the work presented here is already available
clinically, such as the genetic analysis in autism. Other work
could have widespread clinical utility within the next 10
years, especially in the area of ‘personalised’ treatment –
identifying a priori the best treatment for the individual
patient. However, translating this neuroscience research into
better patient care requires sustained support of experimental
medicine and clinical trials.
It is our hope that this chapter demonstrates how biological
research may aid diagnosis, risk stratification and the
development of novel medications for the treatment of
mental illnesses. Rather than distancing psychiatry from
important psychological and social factors, much of modern
biological research is aimed at understanding how these
factors interact to produce disease states. Biological advances
are likely to play a valuable part in the holistic management
of patients.
We write this chapter to advocate that the biomedical and
psychosocial models of mental illness are not antithetical, but
are in fact increasingly conceptualised within a single unifying
framework. While most of the important factors determining
the risk and course of mental illnesses can be measured in a
clinical interview, rather than in a laboratory, neuroscience
research offers the exciting opportunity to understand the
mechanisms by which these factors affect their clinical
action. Unfortunately, at a public health level it appears
that, while a biological model of mental illness enhances the
acceptance of treatment, it does not seem to be associated
with a reduction in stigma among the general population.
Our understanding of the biological correlates of mental
health and illness is growing exponentially. As showcased in
this chapter, we are beginning to see how this understanding
could be developed to improve the medical care patients with
mental illness receive, and to widen our understanding of
mental illness as a truly bio-psycho-social construct."
