A high resolution map of the binding site on human IgG1 for human FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, FcγRIIIA, and FcRn receptors has been determined. A common set of IgG1 residues is involved in binding to all FcγR; FcγRII and FcγRIII also utilize residues outside this common set. In addition to residues which, when altered, abrogated binding to one or more of the receptors, several residues were found that improved binding only to specific receptors or simultaneously improved binding to one type of receptor and reduced binding to another type. Select IgG1 variants with improved binding to FcγRIIIA exhibited up to 100%enhancement in antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity using human effector cells; these variants included changes at residues not found at the binding interface in the IgG/FcγRIIIA co-crystal structure (Sondermann, P., Huber, R., Oosthuizen, V., and Jacob, U. (2000)Nature 406, 267–273). These engineered antibodies may have important implications for improving antibody therapeutic efficacy.

Although some of these, e.g. mAbs that bind to a receptor or ligand and thereby block ligand-receptor interaction, may function without utilizing antibody effector mechanisms, other mAbs may need to recruit the immune system to kill the target cell (4Clynes R.A. Towers T.L. Presta L.G. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar, 5Clynes R. Takechi Y. Moroi Y. Houghton A. Ravetch J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

If immune system recruitment is desirable for a therapeutic mAb, engineering the IgG Fc portion to improve effector function (via improved binding to IgG receptors and/or complement) could be a valuable enhancement to antibody therapeutics. Currently, immune system recruitment can be abrogated by altering IgG residues in the lower hinge region (7Armour K.L. Clark M.R. Hadley A.G. Williamson L.M. Eur. J.

Nature. 1988; 332: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), using human IgG2 or IgG4 subclasses that are comparatively inefficient in effector function or using antibody F(ab) or F(ab′)2fragments (although these may have undesirable rapid clearance rates). There are few methods that improve immune system recruitment; these include bispecific antibodies, in which one arm of the antibody binds to an IgG receptor (9Weiner L.M. Alpaugh R.K. von Mehren M. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1997; 45: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), cytokine-IgG fusion proteins (10Peng L.S. Penichet M.L. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 250-258PubMed Google Scholar), and optimization of the Asn297-linked carbohydrate (11Uma-a P. Jean-Mairet J. Moudry R. Amstutz H. Bailey J.E. Nat.

Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Alteration of clearance rate is also being investigated (13Ghetie V. Popov S. Borvak J. Radu C. Matesol D. Medesan C. Ober R.J. Ward E.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). IgG Fc receptors play a critical role in linking IgG antibody-mediated immune responses with cellular effector functions. The latter include release of inflammatory mediators, endocytosis of immune complexes, phagocytosis of microorganisms, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and regulation of immune system cell activation (14Gessner J.E. Heiken H. Tamm A. Schmidt R.E. Ann. Hematol. 1998; 76: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 15Gavin A. Hulett M. Hogarth P.M. van de Winkel J.G.J. Hogarth P.M.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). One group of IgG Fc receptors, FcγR, are expressed on leukocytes and are composed of three distinct classes as follows: FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), and FcγRIII (CD16). In humans, the latter two classes can be further divided into FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB, FcγRIIIA and FcγRIIIB. Structurally, the FcγR are all members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, having an IgG-binding α-chain with an extracellular portion composed of either two (FcγRII and FcγRIII) or three (FcγRI) Ig-like domains. In addition, FcγRI and FcγRIII have accessory protein chains (γ and ζ) associated with the α-chain that function in signal transduction. The receptors are also distinguished by their affinity for IgG. FcγRI exhibits a high affinity for IgG, Ka = 108–109m−1 (14Gessner J.E. Heiken H. Tamm A. Schmidt R.E. Ann. Hematol. 1998; 76: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and can bind monomeric IgG. In contrast, FcγRII and FcγRIII show a weaker affinity for monomeric IgG, Ka ≤ 107m−1 (14Gessner J.E. Heiken H. Tamm A. Schmidt R.E. Ann. Hematol. 1998; 76: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and hence can only interact effectively with multimeric immune complexes. Given the interest in and increasing use of antibody therapeutics, a comprehensive mapping of the binding site on human IgG for the different FcγR could provide for alternative methods of either abrogating or enhancing immune recruitment via FcγR. Previous studies mapped the binding site on human and murine IgG for FcγR primarily to the lower hinge region composed of IgG residues 233–239 (Eu numbering, see Ref. 18Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Other studies proposed additional broad segments, e.g.Gly316–Lys338 for human FcγRI (21Woof J.M. Partridge L.J. Jefferis R. Burton D.R. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), Lys274–Arg301 and Tyr407–Arg416 for human FcγRIII (23Sarmay G. Benzcur M. Petranyi G. Klein E. Kahn M. Stanworth D.R. Gergely J. Mol. Immunol. 1984; 21: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Gergely J. Sandor M. Sarmay G. Uher F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1984; 12: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), or found few specific residues outside the lower hinge, e.g.Asn297 and Glu318 for murine IgG2b interacting with murine FcγRII (25Lund J. Pound J.D. Jones P.T. Duncan A.R. Bentley T. Goodall M. Levine B.A. Jefferis R. Winter G. Mol. Immunol. 1992; 29: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The very recent report of the 3.2-Å crystal structure of the human IgG1 Fc fragment with human FcγRIIIA delineated IgG1 residues Leu234–Ser239, Asp265–Glu269, Asn297–Thr299, and Ala327–Ile332 as involved in binding to FcγRIIIA (26Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The current study provides a complete, high resolution mapping of human IgG1 for human FcγR receptors (FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and FcγRIIIA) as well as for human FcRn, an Fc receptor belonging to the major histocompatability complex structural class, which is involved in IgG transport and clearance (27Raghavan M. Bjorkman P.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 181-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 28Ward E.S. Ghetie V. Ther. Immunol. 1995; 2: 77-94PubMed Google Scholar). The binding site on human IgG1 for the various receptors was determined by individually changing all solvent-exposed amino acids in human IgG1 CH2 and CH3 domains, based on the crystal structure of human IgG1 Fc (30Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), to Ala. A common set of IgG1 residues is involved in binding to all FcγR; FcγRII and FcγRIII also utilize distinct residues in addition to this common set. As well as residues that abrogated binding to one or more Fc receptors when changed to Ala, several positions were found that improved binding only to specific receptors or simultaneously improved binding to one type of FcγR and reduced binding to another type. Notably, for both FcγRIIIA and FcRn, which have crystal structures of complexes with IgG available (26Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 29Burmeister W.P. Huber A.H. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), several IgG residues not found at the IgG:receptor interface had a profound effect on binding and biological activity. Select IgG1 variants with improved binding to FcγRIIIA showed an enhancement in ADCC when either peripheral blood monocyte cells (PBMC) or natural killer cells (NK) were used. These variants may have important implications for using Fc-engineered antibodies for improved therapeutic efficacy. The cDNAs encoding extracellular and transmembrane domains of human FcγRIIA (CD32A; His131 allotype), FcγRIIB (CD32B), and FcγRIIIA (CD16A; Val158 allotype) were provided by Dr. J. Ravetch (Rockefeller University, New York). FcγRIIA-Arg131 allotype and FcγRIIIA-Phe158allotype were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (31Kunkel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The cDNA for FcγRI (CD64) was isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR (GeneAmp, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) of oligo(dT)-primed RNA from U937 cells using primers that generated a fragment encoding the α-chain extracellular domain. The cDNAs encoding human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) α-chain, β2-microglobulin subunit, and human FcγR γ-chain were obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (32Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). The coding regions of all receptors were subcloned into previously described pRK mammalian cell expression vectors (33Eaton D.L. Wood W.I. Eaton D. Hass P.E. Hollingshead P. Wion K. Mather J. Lawn R.M. Vehar G.A. Gorman C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For all FcγR and the FcRn α-chain pRK plasmids, the transmembrane and intracellular domains were replaced by DNA encoding a Gly-His6 tag and human glutathione S-transferase (GST). The 234-amino acid GST sequence was obtained by PCR from the pGEX-4T2 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with NheI andXbaI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Thus, the expressed proteins contained the extracellular domains of the α-chain fused at their carboxyl termini to Gly/His6/GST at amino acid positions as follows: FcγRI, His292; FcγRIIA, Met216; FcγRIIB, Met195; FcγRIIIA, Gln191; FcRn, Ser297 (residue numbers include signal peptides). Plasmids were transfected into the adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line 293 by calcium phosphate precipitation (34Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Protein Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar). Supernatants were collected 72 h after conversion to serum-free PSO4 medium supplemented with 10 mg/liter recombinant bovine insulin, 1 mg/liter human transferrin, and trace elements. Proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and buffer exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using Centriprep-30 concentrators (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Proteins were analyzed on 4–20%SDS-polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (NOVEX), and their amino termini sequenced to ensure proper signal sequence cleavage. Receptor conformation was evaluated by ELISA using murine monoclonals 32.2 (anti-FcγRI), IV.3 (anti-FcγRII), 3G8 (anti-FcγRIII) (Medarex, Annandale, NJ), and B1G6 (anti-β2-microglobulin) (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA). Receptor concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. The humanized IgG1 anti-IgE E27, an affinity-matured variant of anti-IgE E25, binds to the Fcε3 domain of human IgE (35Presta L.G. Lahr S.J. Shields R.L. Porter J.P. Gorman C.M. Jardieu P.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2623-2632PubMed Google Scholar). When mixed with human IgE in a 1:1 molar ratio, the IgE and anti-IgE form a hexameric complex composed of three IgE and three anti-IgE (36Liu J. Lester P. Builder S. Shire S.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10474-10482Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis (31Kunkel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) on E27 IgG1 was used to generate IgG1 variants in which all solvent-exposed residues in the CH2 and CH3 domains were individually altered to Ala; selection of solvent-exposed residues was based on the crystal structure of human IgG1 Fc (30Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Human IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 isotypes of E27 were constructed by subcloning the appropriate heavy chain Fc cDNAs from a human spleen cDNA library into a pRK vector containing the E27 variable heavy domain. All IgG isotypes and variants were expressed using the same E27 κ light chain. Following cotransfection of heavy and light chain plasmids into 293 cells, IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, and variants were purified by protein A chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IgG3 isotype was purified using protein G chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined usingA280 and verified using amino acid composition analysis and a human IgG Fc ELISA. IgGs were also tested for their binding to human IgE in an ELISA format to ensure that they bound IgE as well as native E27. Structural integrity of the variants was also evident by their ability to be purified using protein A (which binds at the CH2:CH3 domain interface (30Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar)) as well as all variants, except P329A, binding similar to native IgG1 to at least one of the five receptors. FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and FcγRIIIA fusion proteins at 1 μg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4, were coated onto ELISA plates (Nalge-Nunc, Naperville, IL) for 48 h at 4 °C. Plates were blocked with Tris-buffered saline, 0.5%bovine serum albumin, 0.05%polysorbate-20, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.45 (assay buffer), at 25 °C for 1 h. E27-IgE hexameric complexes were prepared in assay buffer by mixing equimolar amounts of E27 and human myeloma IgE (37Nilsson K. Bennich H. Johansson S.G.O. Ponten J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1970; 7: 477-489PubMed Google Scholar) at 25 °C for 1 h. Serial 3-fold dilutions of native E27 standard or variant complexes (10.0–0.0045 μg/ml) were added to plates and incubated for 2 h. After washing plates with assay buffer, bound complexes to FcγRIIA and FcγRIIB were detected with peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-human F(ab′)2-specific IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Binding of complexes to FcγRIIIA was detected with peroxidase-conjugated protein G (Bio-Rad). The substrate used was o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma). Absorbance at 490 nm was read using a Vmax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Mountain View, CA). Any contribution to binding via interaction of the IgE in the E27-IgE complexes with the human FcγRII and FcγRIIIA was not apparent based on the lack of binding of several Ala variants (Class 1, Table I).Table IBinding of human IgG1 variants to human FcRn and FcγRVariant1-aResidue numbers are according to the Eu numbering system (18). Variants that had no effect on binding (i.e. did not reduce binding by more than 60%or improve binding by more than 20%) to FcγR or FcRn were as follows: Lys246, Lys248, Asp249, Met252, Thr260, Lys274, Tyr278, Val282, Glu283, Thr289, Glu294, Y300F, Glu318, Lys320, Ser324, A330Q, Thr335, Lys340, Gln342, Arg344, Glu345, Gln347, Arg355, Glu356, Met358, Thr359, Lys360, Asn361, Tyr373, Ser375, Ser383, Asn384, Gln386, Glu388, Asn389, Asn390, Y391F, Lys392, Leu398, Ser400, Asp401, Asp413, Arg416, Gln418, Gln419, Asn421, Val422, Thr437, Gln438, Lys439, Ser440, Ser442, Ser444, and Lys447.FcRn1-bValues are the ratio of binding of the variant to that of native IgG1 at 0.33 or 1 μg/ml.

At least two separately expressed and purified lots of each variant were assayed. Open table in a new tab For the high affinity FcγRI, the receptor fusion protein at 1.5 μg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4, was coated onto ELISA plates (Nunc) for 18 h at 4 °C. Plates were blocked with assay buffer at 25 °C for 1 h. Serial 3-fold dilutions of monomeric E27 and variants (10.0–0.0045 μg/ml) were added to plates and incubated for 2 h. After washing plates with assay buffer, IgG bound to FcγRI was detected with peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-human F(ab′)2-specific IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or with peroxidase-conjugated protein G (Bio-Rad). The substrate used was o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma). Absorbance at 490 nm was read using aVmax plate reader (Molecular Devices). For all FcγR, binding values reported are the binding of each E27 variant relative to native E27, taken as (A490 nm(variant)/A490 nm(native IgG1)) at 0.33 or 1 μg/ml for FcγRII and FcγRIIIA and 2 μg/ml for FcγRI. A value greater than 1 denotes binding of the variant was improved compared with native IgG1, whereas a ratio less than 1 denotes reduced binding compared with native IgG1. Reduced binding to any given receptor was defined as a reduction of ≥40%compared with native IgG; better binding was defined as an improvement of ≥25%compared with native IgG1. The latter was chosen based on the observation that variants with ≥25%improved binding in the ELISA format assay, such as E333A, K334A, and S298A, also showed improved efficacy in the cell-based binding and ADCC assays. ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated with 2 μg/ml NeutrAvidin (Pierce) or streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) in 50 mmcarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, at 4 °C overnight (the same results were obtained with either molecule). Plates were blocked with PBS, 0.5%BSA, 10 ppm Proclin 300 (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), pH 7.2, at 25 °C for 1 h. FcRn-Gly-His6-GST was biotinylated using a standard protocol with biotin-X-NHS (Research Organics, Cleveland, OH) and bound to NeutrAvidin-coated plates at 2 μg/ml in PBS, 0.5%BSA, 0.05%polysorbate-20 (sample buffer), pH 7.2, at 25 °C for 1 h. Plates were then rinsed with sample buffer, pH 6.0. Eight serial 2-fold dilutions of E27 standard or variants (1.6–200 ng/ml) in sample buffer at pH 6.0 were incubated for 2 h. Plates were rinsed with sample buffer, pH 6.0, and bound IgG was detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 anti-human IgG F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in pH 6.0 sample buffer using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) as substrate. Absorbance at 450 nm was read on aVmax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Titration curves were analyzed by a four-parameter nonlinear regression fit (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). For each ELISA plate assay, a full titration curve of E27 standard was done. The absorbance at the midpoint of the titration curve (mid-OD) and its corresponding E27 concentration were determined. Then the concentration of each variant at this mid-OD was determined, and the concentration of E27 was divided by the concentration of each variant. Hence, the values are a ratio of the binding of each variant relative to native IgG1 standard. A control human IgG1 was run on each ELISA plate as a control and had a ratio of 1.12 ± 0.07 (n = 92).

We generated a highly sensitive polyclonal antibody against human UCP2. Its reactivity toward mitochondrial proteins was compared between wild type and ucp2(−/−) mice, leading to non-ambiguous identification of UCP2. We detected UCP2 in spleen, lung, stomach, and white adipose tissue. No UCP2 was detected in heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and brown adipose tissue. The level of UCP2 in spleen mitochondria is less than 1% of the level of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue mitochondria. Starvation and LPS treatments increase UCP2 level up to 12 times in lung and stomach, which supports the hypothesis that UCP2 responds to oxidative stress situations. Stimulation of the UCP2 expression occurs without any change in UCP2 mRNA levels. This is explained by translational regulation of the UCP2 mRNA. We have shown that an upstream open reading frame located in exon two of theucp2 gene strongly inhibits the expression of the protein. This further level of regulation of the ucp2 gene provides a mechanism by which expression can be strongly and rapidly induced under stress conditions.

The deduced coding sequence for UCP2 predicts 59% identity with UCP1, whereas the predicted UCP3 sequence is 72% identical to UCP2. The common characteristic of these proteins is to uncouple the respiratory chain from ATP synthesis by dissipating the proton electrochemical gradient when overexpressed in yeast mitochondria (for reviews see Refs. 9Boss O. Hagen T. Lowell B.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar and 10Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). They may also transport anions, like the other mitochondrial carriers, but these substrates are currently unknown. Over the last few years, several physiological roles have been proposed for UCP2, based on the expression of its mRNA upon various physiological conditions (for review see Ref. 11Fleury C. Sanchis D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1261-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Genetic studies suggested the novel UCPs might be linked to hyperinsulinemia (4Fleury C. Neverova M.

It was also proposed that UCP2 contributes to the inflammatory response and regulates the production of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria (13Lee F.Y. Li Y. Zhu H. Yang S. Lin H.Z. Trush M.

One of the main problems encountered in the physiological studies of the new UCPs is the absence of reliable immunological tools to detect the proteins in vivo. More than 100 publications have described variation of UCP2 mRNA, whereas only seven analyses were performed at the protein level (for reviews see Refs. 9Boss O. Hagen T. Lowell B.B.

In the present study, we have addressed this problem by generating antibodies against the complete human UCP2 sequence, rigorously evaluated their specificity and sensitivity, and compared them with commercial antibodies. Mitochondria were prepared either from ucp2(+/+) or ucp2(−/−) mice that were jointly created by the Ricquier and Collins laboratories (17Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S.

UCP2 protein was immunodetected without ambiguity in spleen, lung, stomach, and gonadal WAT (gWAT) but not in other tissues. Although UCP2 protein was found in vivo at a low level in spleen, lung, stomach, and WAT mitochondria, its expression was strongly increased upon fasting and LPS treatment in lung and stomach. Analysis of UCP2 mRNA and protein levels in transfected COS cells showed that the translation of UCP2 transcript is strongly inhibited by an upstream ORF in the exon two of the gene.

Human UCP2-NP antibody was obtained from Research Diagnostic Inc., and mUCP22-A and hUCP32-A antibodies were from Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX), and anti-cytochrome c antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All mice were 7–10 weeks old.ucp2(−/−) mice were generated on an mix inbred 129 and C57BL/6J background (17Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Goubern M. Alves-Guerra M. Couplan E. Surwit R. Bouillaud F. Richard D. Collins S. Ricquier D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Elevage Janvier (Orleans, France) and were submitted to 24 h of starvation with free access to water or were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of LPS from Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4 (4 mg of LPS/kg of body weight). Control mice were injected with the same volume of PBS. Mice were killed at different times by cervical dislocation. Half of each organ was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept for RNA preparation, and the other half was immediately taken for the preparation of fresh mitochondria. The complete mouse UCP2 transcript was obtained by PCR using the following primers, forward 5′ AAAATCAGTATGCGGCCGCCTTCTGCACTCCTGT 3′ and reverse 5′ TTTCGCTCATTGCGGCCGCCGGGCTTTATGGGTG 3′, and then subcloned in a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Gronioen, Netherlands) after digestion by NotI. The pUCP2-ORF1 was constructed by digestion with the restriction endonuclease HindIII. Mutations of the upstream initiator methionines at positions 123, 159, and 183 were achieved with the Gene Editor kit (Promega, Charbonnières, France) in combination with 2 sense primers 5′ GGACACAATAGTATCAACTTTAAGTGTTTC 3′ and 5′ CCAGCCATTTTCTAGGGAAAATCGAGGGGATCGGGCCTTGGTAGCCACCGGC 3′. Mouse UCP2 cDNA was amplified by PCR using 5′ GATCCATATGGTTGGTTTCAAGGCCAC 3′ and 5′ ATGAAGCTTTCAGAAAGGTGCCTCCC 3′ forward and reverse primers, respectively, and was cloned into NdeI andHindIII restriction sites of pMW7 (18Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), a high copy number expression plasmid closely related to the pET vector family (19Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5999) Google Scholar). Rat UCP1, human UCP2 and mouse UCP3 cDNA sequences were also introduced into a pHis17 expression vector ((20) gift of M. Runswick, Dunn Nutrition Center, Cambridge, UK), a derivative of pMW7 that contains six histidines in frame with BamHI,HindIII, and EcoRI restriction sites of the poly-linker. An internal NdeI site of the rat UCP1 cDNA at nucleotide 581 was first disrupted by mutagenesis using the following primer 5′ GAGCTGGTGACGTATGACCTCATGAAGG 3′ and subcloned intoNdeI and EcoRI sites of pHis17. Human UCP2 and UCP3 cDNA were amplified by PCR using 5′ GGATCCCATATGGTTGGGTTCAAGGC 3′ and 5′ AGCAAGCTTCCCCTTGTAGAAGGCTGTG 3′ as forward primers and 5′ CAGAAGCTTGAAGGGAGCCTCTCGGGA 3′ and 5′ ATGGAACATATGGTTGGACTGAAGCC 3′ as reverse primers. They were both cloned into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pHis17. Fragment of UCP2 cDNA encoding for UCP2-(95–206) peptide was amplified by PCR using 5′ GCATGCATATGCGCATTGGCCTCTACGAC 3′ and 5′ ACTGGAATTCTTTCAGGAGAGTATCTTTG 3′ forward and reverse primers, respectively, and subsequently cloned into NdeI andEcoRI sites of pHis17 expression vector. Cloning into theHindIII of pHis17 expression vector added KLHHHHHH amino acid sequence tag to the C terminus of the recombinant protein, and cloning into the EcoRI site added EFHHHHHH sequence tag. All constructs were sequenced on ABI 373A sequencer using the PRISM Bigdye Terminator sequencing kit (PE-Applied Biosystems, Paris, France). Total RNAs were extracted from frozen tissue as described previously (21Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Toumelin P. Mory G. Bazin R. Arch J. Penicaud L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13905-13910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or from transfected cells with a RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Northern analysis of 20 μg of total tissue RNA or 5 μg of total cell culture RNA was carried out as described (22Cassard A.M. Bouillaud F. Mattei M.G. Hentz E. Raimbault S. Thomas M. Ricquier D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) using an α-32P-labeled and the complete mouse UCP2 cDNA as probe (GenBankTM accession number U69135). Quantification of UCP2 signal was determined with a Packard instant imager (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT), and the signal was normalized after hybridization of the membrane with an 18 S rRNA probe. Fragments of mouse UCP2 and the full-length rat UCP1, human UCP2, and mouse UCP3 were produced as inclusion bodies in the E. coli C41 (DE3) bacterial strain and purified as described previously (23Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar). Proteins were refolded according to Qiagen's protocol and purified in the presence of Fc12 detergent (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and the Biologic Duo-flow high pressure liquid chromatography system (Bio-Rad). Purified hUCP2 protein was cross-linked to NHS-activated Sepharose 4 fast flow. Three hundred micrograms of purified peptides or proteins were injected in 5 different rabbits, twice within 15 days and 1 month later. Animals were bled 14 days after the last boost. Blood was left 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged at 3,000 × g. After inactivation of the complement at 55 °C for 20 min, serum was precipitated with ammonium sulfate according to Ref.24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 298-299Google Scholar and purified by affinity chromatography on 2-ml hUCP2-NHS column as described before (25Miroux B. Casteilla L.

The simian kidney epithelial cell line, COS-7 cells, was routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions and harvested 24 h after transfection for UCP2 mRNA and protein analysis. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Fresh tissues were minced in TES buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose) supplemented with the following protease inhibitors: 1 mmbenzamidine, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml bestatin, 50 μg/ml TPCK, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Minced tissue or COS cells were carefully disrupted in a Thomas's potter at low speed rotation. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation of the homogenate at 750 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of TES buffer. Mitochondria were submitted to another round of 10 min of centrifugation at 750 and 10,000 × g, respectively. Mitochondrial protein content was assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were first separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane by liquid electroblotting (Bio-Rad) for 75 min (125 mA per gel) in a buffer containing 10 mm CAPS and 10% methanol, pH 9. Nonspecific binding was achieved by preincubating the membrane with PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. All antibodies were diluted in PBS-T, 2% dried milk, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The concentration of the antibodies was carefully optimized according to the signal to noise ratio. After extensive washing of the membrane with PBS-T, appropriate peroxidase conjugate antibody was incubated 1 h at room temperature in PBS-T, 2% dried milk. Bound peroxidase-conjugated antibody was revealed with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membrane was exposed for 1, 10, and 60 min on Biomax MR Kodak film. Films were digitized by a Nikon Coolpix 950 camera, and signal was quantified using the Image SXM software version 1.61 6P from NCBI. For statistical analysis, samples were compared on the same blot only. Fragments of the mouse UCP2 and the full-length rat UCP1, human UCP2, and mouse UCP3 were produced as inclusion bodies in the E. coli C41(DE3) bacterial strain (23Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar). Full-length human UCP2 and mUCP2 (amino acid residues 95–206) proteins were purified on nickel columns in the presence of Fc12 detergent and injected into rabbits. Three antisera were obtained, two anti-hUCP2 sera and one anti-mUCP2 (95-206) serum. Table I summarizes the data obtained with all UCP2 antibodies tested in this study. The rUCP1-375-5 serum, an antibody that we raised against the purified rat UCP1 (26Ricquier D. Barlet J.P. Garel J.M. Combes-George M. Dubois M.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), displayed high sensitivity toward UCP1. This antibody could detect only 80 ng of UCP2 inclusion bodies. The mUCP2-IP (Calbiochem), hUCP32-A and mUCP22-A (Alpha Diagnostic) antibodies had a low titer and poor reactivity toward UCP2. Among the anti-peptide antibodies, the hUCP2-NP antibody (Research Diagnostic Int.) was the most sensitive toward UCP2 and was 50 times more selective for UCP2 than either UCP1 or UCP3. However, mUCP2–2/3 and both antibodies we raised against the full-length UCP2, hUCP2-605 and 606, displayed higher sensitivity toward UCP2 than all the other antibodies (Table I).Table ISensitivity and specificity of UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 antibodiesAntibody nameAntigenic regionaNumbers in parentheses correspond to position of amino acids residues defining protein fragment used as antigen.SupplierConcentrationbAll antibodies (except rUCP-(1–375-5)) were purified by affinity chromatography.

Open table in a new tab Since the hUCP2-605 serum we obtained was the most sensitive antibody and equipotent toward human or mouse UCP2, it was selected to investigate UCP2 distribution in mouse tissues. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of UCP2 protein in spleen, stomach, intestine, lung, and white adipose tissue mitochondria; this detection was specific since the 32-kDa band detected by the antibody disappeared in mitochondria fromucp2(−/−) mice (Fig.1 A). Surprisingly, we were unable to detect UCP2 in muscle, heart, liver, and brain mitochondria. Instead, other bands of similar apparent molecular weight appeared in liver, BAT, and especially in brain mitochondria (Fig. 1 B). The strong band observed in BAT mitochondria appears to be UCP1 because it disappeared in BAT mitochondria from ucp1(−/−) mice (data not shown (27Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar)). Incidentally, UCP2 did not appear in BAT mitochondria from ucp1(−/−) mice although theucp2 gene is up-regulated in these mice (data not shown (27Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar,28Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)). Western blot analysis with hUCP2-606 and mUCP2-2/3 antibodies gave similar results. However, both antibodies recognized more unspecific proteins than hUCP2-605 antibody. All other antibodies tested in this study (Table I) did not reveal any band in vivo and instead some of them detected other proteins of similar molecular weight. The hUCP2-NP antibody reacted strongly toward proteins in liver and kidney mitochondria (Fig. 2 A). The rUCP1-375-5, our anti-UCP1 antibody, revealed a faint band in spleen, liver, and, as expected, a strong band in BAT (Fig.2 B). The hUCP32-A antibody reacted with a 30-kDa protein in kidney, liver, and BAT (Fig. 2 C). None of these bands disappeared in mitochondria isolated from ucp2(−/−) mice, demonstrating that these antibodies are unable to detect bona fide UCP2 in vivo. Quantitative analysis showed that UCP2 was 4 and 10 times less abundant in lung and stomach, respectively, than in spleen mitochondria (p< 0.001, Table II). To estimate the amount of UCP2 protein expressed in vivo, we took advantage of the cross-reactivity of hUCP2-605 antibody toward UCP1. As shown in Fig. 3, 1 μg of BAT mitochondria produced about the same signal in Western blot than 20 μg of spleen mitochondria. The same experiment was repeated five times with mitochondria from different mice. Quantification of the signals led us to the conclusion that the hUCP2-605 antibody reacted 19-fold more toward BAT mitochondria than spleen mitochondria (19 ± 2;n = 5). Since the signal detected in BAT corresponded to UCP1 and given that the hUCP2-605 antibody was 8-fold more sensitive toward UCP2 than UCP1 (Table I), we concluded that UCP2 is ∼160-fold less abundant in spleen mitochondria than UCP1 is in BAT mitochondria.Table IIExpression of UCP2 in mouse tissuesMouse tissues (mitochondrial fraction)Relative amount of UCP2 proteinRelative amount of UCP2 mRNASpleen (control)aSpleen was chosen as reference for both UCP2 mRNA and protein levels.

Therefore, C57BL/6 mice were either treated with LPS (injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of LPS or PBS buffer) or fasted for 24 h, and several organs were analyzed for their UCP2 protein content. Following 24 h of fasting, UCP2 remained undetectable in muscle and constant in spleen mitochondria, but a 6-fold increase of UCP2 protein was observed in stomach and lung mitochondria (Fig. 4,A and B). Two LPS-treated mice and two PBS-treated mice were killed 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 (3 mice), 18, and 24 h after injection. Western blot analysis showed that UCP2 protein appears 10 h after LPS injection only in lung mitochondria and reaches its maximal level 2 h later. UCP2 protein returned to its basal expression level 24 h after injection (Fig.5, A and B). No change in UCP2 protein was observed in the control mice treated with PBS (Fig. 5 B) and in stomach, liver, duodenum, kidney, heart, muscle, and spleen of LPS-treated mice. Quantitative analysis of LPS stimulation revealed that UCP2 protein increased 12-fold in lung mitochondria 14 h after injection (p < 0.001, Table II). To assess whether the apparent increase of UCP2 protein in lung mitochondria could simply reflect an increase of UCP2 protein stability, 280 μg of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein translation, was also injected intraperitoneally in four mice 9.5 h after LPS injection. Two and one-half hours later all mice were killed and analyzed for their UCP2 content in lung mitochondria. Cycloheximide treatment completely abolished UCP2 stimulation observed 12 h after LPS injection (98.2% inhibition p < 0.001, Table II). This experiment showed that LPS treatment stimulates the de novo synthesis of UCP2 protein in lung.Figure 5Induction of UCP2 protein in mouse lung mitochondria after LPS injection.

Although UCP2 protein level was 4 and 10 times lower in lung and stomach, respectively, than in spleen mitochondria, UCP2 mRNA levels in those tissues were very similar (Table II). The same discrepancy between UCP2 protein and mRNA levels was observed in stimulated conditions. The levels of UCP2 mRNA in lung and stomach marginally increased upon fasting (Fig. 4, C andD, and Table II). UCP2 mRNA levels also remained surprisingly unchanged over the LPS time course experiment (Fig.5 C). Fourteen hours after LPS injection, UCP2 mRNA levels in spleen and lung were comparable, although UCP2 protein content in lung had increased 12 times to reach three times the basal level of UCP2 in spleen (Table II). Finally, despite the strong variations of UCP2 protein that were observed in basal or stimulated conditions, the"

Hyperleptinemia began within 24 h and increased progressively to 26 ng/ml after 10 weeks, correlating with an ∼150-fold increase in body fat (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001). During this time, the triacylglycerol (TG) content of nonadipose tissues rose only 1–2.7-fold implying antisteatotic activity. In rodents without leptin action (fa/fa rats and ob/ob anddb/db mice) receiving a 6% fat diet, nonadipose tissue TG was 4–100 times normal. In normal rats on a 60% fat diet, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α protein and liver-carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (l-CPT-1) mRNA increased in liver. In their pancreatic islets, fatty-acid oxidation increased 30% without detectable increase in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α or oxidative enzymes, whereas lipogenesis from [14C]glucose was slightly below that of the 4% fat-fed rats (p < 0.05). Tissue-specific overexpression of wild-type leptin receptors in the livers offa/fa rats, in which marked steatosis is uniformly present, reduced TG accumulation in liver but nowhere else. We conclude that a physiologic role of the hyperleptinemia of caloric excess is to protect nonadipocytes from steatosis and lipotoxicity by preventing the up-regulation of lipogenesis and increasing fatty-acid oxidation.

First, plasma leptin levels of rodents and humans are low in the lean and high in the obese (1Maffei M. Halaas J. Ravussin E. Pratley R.E. Lee G.H. Zhang Y. Fei H. Kim S. Lallone R. Ranganathan S. Kern P.A. Friedman J.M. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar), hardly the credentials of an antiobesity hormone. Second, diet-induced obesity is not prevented in hypoleptinemic mice by restoring their plasma leptin levels to normal with recombinant leptin (2Surwit R.S. Edwards C.L. Murthy S. Petro A.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1203-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Third, there is no evidence that overnutrition and obesity have ever posed a serious survival threat in evolution. On the contrary, the principal survival threat throughout evolution has been famine, against which obesity provides a measure of protection as the “thrifty gene” hypothesis maintains (3Neel J.V. Nutr. Rev. 1997; 57: S2-S9Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Finally, it seems implausible to suggest that hormones evolve for the purpose of preventing the clinical consequences of their own deficiency. Just as insulin evolved to confer advantages in nutrient metabolism rather than to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis, leptin must have evolved, not to prevent its deficiency syndrome, obesity (4Halaas J.L. Gajiwaia K.S. Maffei M. Cohen S.L. Chalt B.T. Rabinowitz D. Lallone R.L. Burley S.K. Friedman J.M. Science. 1995; 269: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar), but rather to confer a metabolic advantage that has not as yet been identified. We previously had suggested that the metabolic advantage conferred by the hyperleptinemia of obesity might be the prevention of overaccumulation of triacylglycerols (TG)1 in nonadipose tissues (5Unger R.H. Zhou Y.-T. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Clearly, leptin does have powerful antilipogenic activity in some such tissues (6Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.-Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In the absence of leptin action, lipogenesis is increased and fatty-acid (FA) oxidation is reduced (7Lee Y. Hirose H. Zhou Y.-T. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), accounting for the steatosis and lipotoxicity that occur in such circumstances (7Lee Y.

Ultimately, the progressive overaccumulation of lipids causes death of cells in pancreatic islets and myocardium, resulting in diabetes and myocardial failure, which are the most serious complications of obesity. It has been proposed that the lipid overaccumulation enlarges the intracellular pool of fatty acyl-CoA beyond the oxidative requirements of the cell (15Unger R.H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 7: 276-282Google Scholar), thereby providing substrate for potentially destructive nonoxidative pathways, such as de novo ceramide formation (16Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.-T. Levi M.

Certainly hyperleptinemia induced by adenoviral transfer of the leptin gene has remarkable lipopenic and antilipogenic activity in tissues of normal rats, down-regulating the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis while up-regulating those genes involved in β-oxidation and thermogenesis (19Zhou Y.-T.

Although they are consistent with putative antisteatotic activity of hyperleptinemia, such studies do not prove that the actual physiologic role of adipocyte-derived hyperleptinemia in obesity is to prevent the ectopic accumulation of TG in nonadipose tissues. This study was designed to test this premise. Three groups of rodents were employed. Obese homozygous (fa/fa) ZDF-Drt rats, which are unresponsive to leptin because of a loss-of-function mutation in their leptin receptor (10Iida M. Murakami T. Ishida K. Mizuno A. Kuwajima M. Shima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 11Phillips M.S. Liu O. Hammond H. Dugan V. Hey P. Caskey C.T. Hess J.F. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), and lean wild-type (+/+) ZDF controls were bred in our laboratory from ZDF/Drt-fa (F10) rats purchased from Dr. R. Peterson (University of Indiana School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN). Two groups of mice, C57BL/6J-ob/ob and C57BL/KS-J-db/db, and their wild-type controls, C57BL/6J +/+ and C57BL/KS-J +/+ mice, were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). To achieve diet-induced obesity in normal rats, Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats, purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC) were employed. They were housed in individual metabolic cages (Nalgene, Rochester, NY) with a constant temperature and 12 h of light altering with 12 h of darkness. Body weight and food intake were measured weekly. Initially, all rats were fed standard chow (Teklad 4% mouse/rat diet, Teklad Madison, WI) ad libitum and had free access to water. At 4 weeks of age they either continued on this diet, which contains 24.8% protein, 4% fat, and 3.94 Kcal/g, or they were switched to a high fat diet (Purina Test Diet, Purina Mills, Inc., Richmond, IN) containing 60% fat, 7.5% carbohydrate, 24.5% protein, and 6.7 Kcal/g to produce diet-induced obesity. In in vivo experiments containing a total of 1 × 1012 plaque-forming units of recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA of the leptin receptor OB-Rb (AdCMV-OB-Rb) or as a control β-galactosidase (AdCMV-β-galactosidase), prepared as described previously (20Chen G.X. Koyama K. Yuan X. Lee Y. Zhou Y.-T. O'Doherty R. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14795-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), were infused into conscious animals over a 10-min period through polyethylene tubing (PE-50, Becton Dickinson) previously anchored in the left jugular vein of 9-week-old ZDF fa/fa rats under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (20Chen G.X. Koyama K. Yuan X. Lee Y. Zhou Y.-T. O'Doherty R. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14795-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To compare the expression of wild-type OB-Rb in fa/fa rats with mutated OB-Rb, total RNA of rat liver and hypothalamus were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcription of total RNA was carried out after treating RNA samples with RNase-free DNase I. The first strand cDNA was then used to PCR-amplify an OB-RbcDNA fragment with OB-Rb-specific primers encompassing the region with thefa/fa mutation as described previously (11Phillips M.S. Liu O. Hammond H. Dugan V. Hey P. Caskey C.T. Hess J.F. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The conditions of the PCR were as follows: denaturation for 45 s at 92 °C, annealing for 45 s at 55 °C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C. The amplified PCR products were digested with MspI at 37 °C 1 h and then run on a 1.2% agarose gel. Total RNA was extracted by the TRIzol isolation method, and Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (21Kakuma T. Lee Y. Higa M. Wang Z.-W. Pan W. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). cDNA probes for the oxidative enzymes, acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) and liver-carnitine palmitoyl- transferase-1 (liver-CPT-1), were prepared by reverse transciptase-PCR using the following primers: ACO-sense (amino acids 2891–2910), 5′-GCCCTCAGCTATGGTATTAC-3′ and ACO-antisense (amino acids 3505–3524), 5′-AGGAACTGCTCTCACAATGC-3′ (GenBankTMaccession number J02752); and liver-CPT-1-sense (amino acids 3094–3113), 5′-TATGTGAGGATGCTGCTTCC-3′ andliver-CPT-1-antisense (amino acids 3703–3722), 5′-CTCGGAGAGCTAAGCTTGTC-3′ (GenBankTM accession numberL07736). The DNA fragment excised after digesting pAC CMV-OB-Rb (13Wang M.-Y. Koyama K. Shimabukuro M. Newgard C. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with KpnI/HindIII restriction enzymes hybridizes only the intracellular domain of OB-Rb was also used as a probe of OB-Rb. The hybridization signals were analyzed by Molecular Imager GS-363 (Bio-Rad). Values were normalized to the signal generated with an 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene probe. The procedure used was based on methods described by Jensen et al. (22Jensen J. Serup P. Karlsen C. Nielsen T.F. Madsen O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and O'Doherty et al. (23O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D.

Total RNA (1 μg) was treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega), and first-strand cDNA was generated with the oligo(dT) primer in the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH). Multiplex reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out in 25-μl reactions with 1.5 μl of the diluted cDNA reaction as template mixed with 23.5 μl of PCR mix containing 1.25 units of Taq polymerase and buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) containing 25 μm dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, 2.5 μCi of 2500 Ci/mmol [α-33P]dCTP (1 CI = 37 GBq) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 5 pmol of each primer (Table I). The standard thermal cycle profile was as follows for lipogenic enzyme mRNA (FAS, ACC, and GPAT) and β-oxidative enzyme gene mRNA (liver-CPT-1 and ACO): denaturation of 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 24 cycles in liver and for 26 cycles in islets.Table IPrimers employed for multiplex reverse transcriptase-PCRGeneSense primer (5′-3′)Antisense primer (5′-3′)Predicted sizeSpeciesGenBank accession no.base pairsACCACAGTGAAGGCTTACGTCTGAGGATCCTTACAACCTCTGC242RatJ03808FASTGCTGTGGACCTCATCACTATGGATGATGTTGATGATAGAC297RatM76767GPATCCTCTGAACTGGAGAAGTGAAGACAGTATGTGGCACTCTC287RatAF021348TBPACCCTTCACCAATGACTCCTATGTGACTGCAGCAAATCGCTTGG186MouseD01034 Open table in a new tab Reaction products were separated on 7 m urea, 1× TBE (0.1m Tris base, 83 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA) and 6% polyacrylamide gels. Dried and PhosphorImager screens were scanned by a Molecular Imager System (GS-363). TATA box-binding protein mRNA was coamplified as an internal control, and data were expressed as ratios to its signal. To avoid biased results caused by potential interference between individual amplicons, we analyzed the amplification kinetics of individual amplicons in reactions where several products were coamplified. Representative experiments, in which mRNA encoding lipogenic enzymes and TATA box-binding protein in pancreatic islets were simultaneously amplified, show the noncompetitive amplification of individual products and their almost identical rate of amplification as indicated by the slopes within the exponential phase observed from a linear regression analysis. 50 mg of liver from the rats were homogenized in 2 ml of lysate buffer with proteinase inhibitors. A total of 100 μg of protein in 0.5 ml of buffer were used for precipitation with 1:500 goat anti-PPARα (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA). Protein A beads from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech were used for binding. Immunoblotting was carried out with rabbit-anti-PPARα from Calbiochem at 1:1500. Using the method of Stein et al.(24Stein D.T. Babcock E.E. Malloy C.R. McGarry J.D. Int. J. Obes. 1995; 19: 804-810Google Scholar), proton MRS and magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained with a 4.7-T 40-cm-bore system (Omega chemical shift imaging model, Bruker Instruments, Fremont, CA) with a 6-inch-diameter birdcage coil. Anesthetized rats were placed supine within the coil and positioned in the center of the magnet. Proton spectra of the rat were resolved into water and fat resonances, the areas of which were quantified using the nuclear magnetic resonance software program NRM-1 (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO) assuming equal line widths for both resonances. Proton images were obtained from the abdominal region of each rat. Spin-echo transaxial images were acquired with the following parameters: two transients, recycle time = 500 ms, echo time = 16 ms, 2-mm slice thickness, 2-mm interslice gap, eight slices, a 140-mm field of vision, and a 128 × 256 matrix. Images were analyzed using NIH Image software (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD). Animals were sacrificed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. Tissues were dissected and placed in liquid nitrogen. Total lipids were extracted from about 100 mg of tissue by the method of Folch et al. (25Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dried under N2 gas. TG was assayed by the method of Danno et al. (26Danno H. Jicho Y. Budiyanto S. Furukawa Y. Kimura S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1992; 38: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tail vein blood was collected in capillary tubes coated with EDTA. Plasma was stored at −20 °C. Plasma leptin was assayed using the Linco leptin assay kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method using the glucose analyzer II (Beckman, Brea, CA). Plasma free fatty acids were determined using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals kit. Plasma TG levels were measured by the glycerol phosphate oxidase-Trinder triglyceride kit (Sigma). Oxidation of [3H]palmitate by islets was determined as described previously. Groups of 100–200 islets were incubated in duplicate with 1 mm9,10-[3H]palmitate for 3 days. Palmitate oxidation was assessed by measuring tritiated water in the medium. Excess [3H]palmitate was removed by precipitating twice with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 2% bovine serum albumin. Supernatants in a microcentrifuge tube were placed in a scintillation vial containing unlabeled water and incubated at 50 °C for 18 h. Tritiated water was measured as described for use of [3H]glucose (27Milburn J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. BeltrandelRio H. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1295-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Incorporation of [U-14C]glucose (14.6 mmol/liter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) into lipids was measured in islets as described previously in detail (28Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). About 200 islets were cultured for 3 days in medium containing 8 mmol/liter of glucose. After 3 days in culture, lipids were extracted from the islets according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (29Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42865) Google Scholar), and counts incorporated into total lipid were determined. All values shown are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test by one-way analysis of variance. If the function of leptin during caloric excess is to minimize the accumulation of lipids in nonadipose tissues, hyperleptinemia should begin promptly at the start of overnutrition and increase progressively as the overnutrition continues. To test this theory, a group of 10 normal male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats was fed a diet in which 60% of the calories were derived from fat. Age-matched control rats received a 4% fat diet. Both groups were observed for 70 days. Plasma leptin levels in control rats were relatively unchanged, rising by only 0.04 ± 0.002 ng/ml/day to a level of only 2.80 ± 0.77 ng/ml on the final day of the 70-day study. By contrast, in rats on a 60% fat diet, plasma leptin rose to 4.3 ± 0.2 ng/ml (p < 0.001) within 24 h and increased progressively thereafter by 0.37 ± 0.07 ng/ml/day to a level of 26 ng/ml at 70 days (Fig. 1 A). In this group the rise in plasma leptin levels paralleled the expansion in body fat mass quantified by MRS (Fig. 1 B); there was a highly significant correlation between body fat and the plasma leptin level (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001) (Fig.1 C). Thus, leptin levels appear to respond promptly to a caloric excess, and they increase in proportion to enlargement of the adipose mass, which is consistent with the postulated role. If the hyperleptinemia induced by high fat feeding does in fact protect nonadipose tissues of normal rats from overaccumulation of lipids, their tissue TG content should remain low during the development of obesity despite the expansion of the adipose tissue mass and the concomitant rise in plasma lipid levels. To test this theory, we measured tissue TG content of nonadipose tissues 70 days after the start of the high fat diet at which point the total body fat measured by MRS had increased an ∼150-fold above the pre-diet base line (Fig. 1 B), and plasma TG and free fatty-acid levels were significantly higher (Fig.2 A). However, TG content in nonadipose tissues increased only 1–2.7-fold above the base line (Fig.2 B). Thus, nonadipose tissues of leptin-responsive hyperleptinemic rats accumulated only a small fraction of the total increase in body fat acquired over 70 days of excessive fat intake, during which time the animals had became grossly obese (Fig.1 B). In the liver, protection against steatosis might involve not only increased secretion of very low density liprotein but also enhanced FA oxidation. In the latter case, an increase in the expression of PPARα and its target enzymes liver-CPT-1 and ACO might be expected (30Zhou Y.-T. Shimabukuro M. Wang M.-Y. Lee Y. Higa M. Milburn J.L. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8898-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To determine whether the in vivo protection against hepatic overaccumulation of TG in normal rats on a high fat diet is mediated by this mechanism, we semiquantified PPARα protein and ACO and liver-CPT-1 mRNAs in livers of normal rats receiving either a 60 or a 4% fat intake. PPARα protein and liver-CPT-1 mRNA were both significantly greater in the former group, but ACO mRNA was not different (Fig. 3, A andB). Unlike liver, islets cannot export excess FA, which may account for their vulnerability in obesity. To determine the mechanism of the protection against lipid overaccumulation that prevails early in the course of obesity, we measured the rate of oxidation of [3H]palmitate in isolated islets of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats receiving either a 4 or 60% fat diet. Oxidation was 30% greater in pancreatic islets of rats on the 60% fat diet than in controls that were on the 4% fat diet (Fig.4 A). However, unlike in liver, no change in ACO or liver-CPT-1 could be detected by multiplex-PCR (data not shown). These findings suggest that the preexisting oxidative machinery of the islets was able to accommodate this increase in oxidation without an increase in expression of genes encoding the enzymes. We had previously reported that in the absence of leptin activity as infa/fa ZDF rats, increased lipogenesis was the most important single factor in the ectopic overaccumulation of lipids in islets (7Lee Y. Hirose H. Zhou Y.-T. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,31Cook W.S. Yelandi B.V. Ras M.S. Hashimoto T. Reddy K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in normal rats the high fat diet should not induce the increase in lipogenesis and lipogenic enzymes that had been observed in fat-laden islets of the leptin-insensitive fa/farats. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, there was no increase in the incorporation of [14C]glucose to lipids or in the expression of lipogenic enzymes. In fact, a small but significant decrease in lipogenesis and in fatty acid synthase mRNA was evident (Fig. 4, B and C). This was in sharp contrast to the ZDF fa/fa rats in which lipogenesis was 2.5 times greater. If the antilipogenic protection observed in normal rats during caloric excess did in fact require the action of the accompanying hyperleptinemia, rodent models with either a leptin deficiency (ob/ob mice) or a loss-of-function mutation in their leptin receptors (db/db mice and ZDF fa/fa rats) would be unprotected from lipid overaccumulation. We, therefore, measured the plasma leptin levels (Fig. 5 A) and the TG content of islets, skeletal muscle, heart, and liver of these “unleptinized” rodents (Fig. 5 B). Although their diet contained only 6% fat, the TG content of their nonadipose tissues ranged from ∼4 to ∼100-fold above normal controls on the same diet. Thus, when leptin action is lacking, protection from lipid overaccumulation in nonadipocytes is also lacking, even when the dietary fat intake is normal. If the marked hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia of obese ZDF fa/fa rats are the result of a lack of direct leptin action on the liver, transgenic overexpression of the wild-type leptin receptor in the liver of these leptin receptor-defective animals should protect them. Therefore, we infused into 9-week-old ZDF fa/fa rats 1012plaque-forming units of recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA of wild-type OB-Rb, the full-length isoform of the leptin receptor (AdCMV-OB-Rb). AdCMV-β-galactosidase was infused into age-matched ZDFfa/fa rats as a control. The wild-type OB-Rb transgene introduced in vivo with an adenovirus vector was expressed exclusively in the steatotic liver of the ZDF fa/fa rats (Fig. 6 A). None was detected in any other tissues including the hypothalamus. One week after treatment with AdCMV-OB-Rb plasma, TG levels of ZDFfa/fa rats declined slightly below pretreatment levels and remained significantly below the controls for 3 weeks after AdCMV-OB-Rb treatment (Fig. 5 B). Liver TG content was significantly less than that of β-galactosidase controls and untreated controls (Fig.5 C), the result of a delay in the increase in liver TG compared with the controls. TG contents of heart and skeletal muscle were unaffected (Fig. 6 B). Food intake was identical in the two adenovirus-treated groups (29.8 ± 1.4 g/dayversus 29.8 ± 1.5 g/day). Because the liver was the only site of expression of the normal OB-Rb in these ZDFfa/fa rats and the only site of antisteatotic action, we must assume that the elevated endogenous leptin levels, which averaged 24 ± 2 ng/ml in AdCMV-OB-Rb-treated rats and 28 ± 2 ng/ml in controls, exerted a direct antisteatotic action on the liver. This strongly implies that the function of hyperleptinemia of obesity is to prevent steatosis in tissues with functioning OB-Rb. These findings suggest that a physiologic role of leptin during overnutrition is to protect nonadipocytes from the adverse consequences of lipid overaccumulation. This protection begins promptly at the start of overfeeding as the result of progressively increasing hyperleptinemia that continues to rise for the duration of hypernutrition. This appeared to minimize overaccumulation of lipids both by preventing the increase in lipogenesis that occurs in the absence of leptin action (31Cook W.S. Yelandi B.V. Ras M.S. Hashimoto T. Reddy K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and through the up-regulation of β-oxidative metabolism of the surplus fatty acids (7Lee Y. Hirose H. Zhou Y.-T. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Whereas in the liver there was an increase in PPARα protein and CPT-1 mRNA, no such changes could be detected in pancreatic islets despite a 30% increase in the rate of [3H]palmitate oxidation. The greater induction of FA β-oxidative enzymes in liver than in extrahepatic tissues confirms a recent observation by Cook et al. (31Cook W.S. Yelandi B.V. Ras M.S. Hashimoto T. Reddy K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In islets the antilipogenic action of hyperleptinemia appears to be at least as important as the increase in FA oxidation in protecting islets from the lipid overload. When leptin action is lacking as in hyperphagic fa/fa ZDF rats, the fat-laden islets have a high rate of [14C]glucose incorporation into lipids in association with increased PPARγ, acetyl CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase expression on a 6% fat intake (32Zhou Y.-T. Shimabukuro M. Lee Y. Koyama K. Higa M. Ferguson T. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1998; 49: 1904-1908Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By contrast, in normal rats receiving the 60% fat diet, these rates remained in the low normal range and the lipogenic rate declined. When the antilipogenic effect of leptin is lacking, lipogenesis is excessive and is not reduced by lipid excess, as in normal islets (30,32). The most compelling evidence in support of the antisteatotic role for leptin was the in vivo demonstration in leptin-unresponsivefa/fa ZDF rats that transgenic overexpression of the wild-type receptor in their livers prevented the severe hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia that otherwise occurred. These findings are congruent with earlier evidence of the antisteatotic action of recombinant leptin (33Shimomura I. Hamner R.E. Ikemoto S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) and of transplanted fat tissue in “fatless” mice with congenital lipodystrophy (34Gavrilova O. Marcus-Samuels B. Graham D. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Castle A.L. Venson C. Eckhaus M. Reitman M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in our experiments the wild-type leptin receptors were expressed only in the liver and not in the hypothalamus or anywhere else. Therefore, it follows that the endogenous hyperleptinemia of those obesefa/fa rats must have acted directly via the transgenic OB-Rb to prevent the lipid overaccumulation. The prompt rise of plasma leptin levels on the very first day of the high fat diet and their high degree of correlation with the expanding body fat are all consistent with the response of an antilipogenic hormone with a physiologic liporegulatory mission, namely to maintain FA homeostasis in nonadipocytes during overnutrition. This protection may account for the fact that in hyperleptinemic rats and humans the lipotoxic complications of diet-induced obesity do not appear until late in life when leptin effectiveness wanes (35Qian H. Azain M.J. Hartzell D.L. Baile C.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Wang Z.W. Pan W.T. Lee Y. Kakuma T. Zhou Y.-T. Unger R.H. FASEB J. 2001; 13: 105-114Google Scholar). When leptin is absent as in congenital generalized lipodystrophy (33Shimomura I. Hamner R.E. Ikemoto S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) or when leptin receptors are congenitally defective as in ZDF rats, these complications appear in severe form early in life. It should be emphasized that we do not suggest that the direct antisteatotic activity ascribed to the endogenous hyperleptinemia of obesity occurs in normal lean animals. It appears to be a factor only during overnutrition when plasma leptin levels approach or exceed the threshold for transport across the blood-brain barrier, which is probably in the vicinity of 10 ng/ml (37Wang Z.-W. Zhou Y.-T. Kakuma T. Lee Y. Higa M. Kalra S.P. Dube M.G. Kalra P.S. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10373-10378Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the absence of overnutrition, plasma levels are below 5 ng/ml, and leptin action is presumed to be largely on the hypothalamic centers for control of food intake and thermoregulation (38Friedman J.M.

The diverse group of hydrogenases can be divided into three classes according to their metal composition in the active center (1Wu L.-F. Mandrand M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 104: 243-270Crossref Google Scholar). The nickel-iron hydrogenases are widespread among all bacteria families and have been well characterized during the last 30 years (2Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 167-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The iron sulfur proteins consist of one to four subunits and have an additional nickel atom in the catalytic site (3Przybyla A.E. Robbins J. Menon N. Peck Jr., H.D. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 88: 109-136Crossref Google Scholar, 4Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). In contrast, the iron hydrogenases possess only [Fe-S] clusters and an iron cofactor with an unique structure of six iron atoms (5Adams M.W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 115-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 6Nicolet Y. Lemon B.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Peters J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 138-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The third class of hydrogenases lacks the iron sulfur clusters as well as additional metal atoms and was found only in methanogenic bacteria (7Zirngibl C. van Dongen W. Schworer B. von Bunau R.

The enzymes allow fermentative anaerobes to evolve H2 without exogenous electron acceptors other than protons (14Peters J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). They show a high specific activity that is about 100 fold higher compared with the nickel-iron hydrogenases (15Adams M.W.W. Mortenson L.E. Chen J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 594: 105-176Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all iron hydrogenases are extremely sensitive to oxygen and carbon monoxide. The structures of the iron hydrogenases fromClostridium pasteurianum and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans have recently been investigated by x-ray crystallography (16Peters J.W. Lanzilotta W.N. Lemon B.J. Seefeldt L.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nicolet Y. Piras C. Legrand P. Hatchikian E.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure. 1999; 7: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). The proteins consist of one or two subunits and have a remarkable iron cofactor (H cluster) in the catalytic site. The H cluster contains an unusual supercluster comprising a [4Fe4S] subcluster and a [2Fe] center, which are bridged together by a single cysteinyl sulfur (18Adams M.W.W. Stiefel E.I. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A number of conserved amino acids forms a hydrophobic pocket that shields the [2Fe] subcluster from the solvent. In all known iron hydrogenases at least eight conserved cysteines were found at the N-terminal site of the protein that coordinate two further [4Fe-4S] clusters (F cluster). It is discussed that the F clusters are responsible for the electron transfer from the surface of the protein to the active site (17Nicolet Y. Piras C. Legrand P. Hatchikian E.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure. 1999; 7: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 19Cammack R. Nature. 1999; 397: 214-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In green algae, Gaffron (20Gaffron H. Nature. 1939; 143: 204-205Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar) discovered a hydrogen metabolism 60 years ago. After anaerobic adaptation, he observed both H2 uptake and hydrogen evolution dependent on the CO2 partial pressure (21Gaffron H. Am. J. Bot. 1940; 27: 273-283Crossref Google Scholar, 22Gaffron H. Rubin J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1942; 26: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). After bubbling the cells with an inert gas like argon, high rates of H2 production can be measured in the light (23Bishop N.I. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1966; 17: 185-208Crossref Google Scholar). Electrons are supplied either by photochemical water splitting at photosystem II, which results in simultaneous production of hydrogen and oxygen, or by metabolic oxidation of organic compounds with release of CO2 (24Senger H Bishop N.I. Planta. 1979; 145: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Randt C. Senger H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1985; 42: 553-557Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Ben-Amotz A. Gibbs M. Biochem.

Light-dependent electron transport from organic substrate through the plastoquinone pool to the hydrogenase provides the cells with ATP under anaerobic conditions (28Bamberger E.S. King D. Erbes D.L. Gibbs M. Plant Physiol. 1982; 69: 1268-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Greenbaum E. Lee J.W. Biohydrogen. 1998; 31: 235-240Google Scholar). From the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii a monomeric iron hydrogenase with high specific activity has been isolated (30Happe T. Naber J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 31Happe T. Mosler B. Naber J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In contrast, a nickel-iron hydrogenase was described for another well examined green alga, Scenedesmus obliquus(32Schnackenberg J. Schulz R. Senger H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Zinn T. Schnackenberg J. Haak D. Romer S. Schulz R. Senger H. Z. Naturforsch. 1994; 49: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The protein consists of two subunits of about 36 and 55 kDa and might be located in the chloroplast. To investigate whether hydrogenases of the iron-only type also occur in green algae other than C. reinhardtii, we decided to look for the gene of a hydrogenase in S. obliquus. Interestingly, we isolated the protein and the gene encoding a monomeric iron hydrogenase (HydA). Although the H cluster of the HydA protein ofS. obliquus is very conserved, the N-terminal site is completely different compared with other iron hydrogenases. Further cysteines are not present. These cysteine residues coordinate the typical F clusters that are necessary for the electron pathway in other iron hydrogenases. We performed physiological measurements of the hydrogen evolving activity in the present of chloroplast ferredoxin specific inhibitors as well as antibodies against this protein. The results clearly indicated that ferredoxin transfers electrons to the hydrogenase and links the enzyme to photosynthesis. The expression of the hydA gene is regulated at the transcriptional level. The mRNA is transcribed very rapidly during the process of anaerobic adaptation. Wild-typeS. obliquus Kützing 276-6 was obtained originally from the culture collection of algae at the University of Göttingen. Cells were cultured photoheterotrophically (34German D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) in batch cultures at 25 °C under continuous irradiance of 150 μmol photons × m−2 s−1. For anaerobic adaptation, 4-liter cultures were bubbled vigorously with air supplemented with 5% CO2. After harvesting the cells in the mid exponential stage of growth, the pellet was resuspended in fresh Tris acetate phosphate medium. The algae were anaerobically adapted by flushing the culture with argon in the dark. The in vitrohydrogenase activity was measured by using a gas chromatograph from Hewlett Packard (HP 5890, Series II) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a molecular sieve column. Methylviologen reduced by sodium dithionite was used as electron donor as described before (30Happe T. Naber J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). 1 unit is defined as the amount of hydrogenase evolving 1 μmol H2 × min−1 at 25 °C. The in vivo activity in the presence of different inhibitors of the photosynthetic electron flow was determined as described (30Happe T. Naber J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). After anaerobic adaptation, cells were harvested, diluted in fresh Tris acetate phosphate medium, and transferred to sealed tubes. Inhibitors were added 1 h before H2 evolving activity was measured. Cells were broken by sonification. Thylakoid membranes and photosynthetic electron transport chain remained intact as shown by O2 polarography. Ferredoxin of C. reinhardtiiand S. obliquus was isolated according to the method of Schmitter et al. (35Schmitter J.M. Jacquot J.-P. de Lamotte-Guery F. Beauvallet C. Dutka S. Gadal P. Decottignies P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). RACE-PCR (36Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Siebert P. Krieg P.A A Laboratory Guide to RNA: Isolation, Analysis, and Synthesis. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 273-321Google Scholar)1was performed with the SMARTTMRACE cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations except for modifications of the PCR and hybridization conditions. Starting material consisted of 1 μg of mRNA from anaerobically adapted cells. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out with a Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in two separate reaction tubes containing either the 5′- or the 3′-RACE-PCR specific primer from the kit. The cDNA of each sample served as template for the following PCR. For the 5′-RACE-PCR, Universal Primer Mix (CLONTECH) and the antisense primer Sc7 were used. The amplification of the 3′-cDNA end was performed with Universal Primer Mix and the sense primer Sc6. To obtain more distinct PCR signals, the PCR was repeated for both reactions with nested universal primers and designed primers (inverse Sc6 and inverse Sc7, respectively) using a dilution of the products of the first PCR as template. RACE-PCR was also implemented to map the transcription initiation site of the hydA mRNA (37Gong B. Ge R. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A gene-specific primer (Sc17) was used to carry out the first strand cDNA synthesis with the Supercript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 200 ng of mRNA as template. PCR was performed using either Sc12 or Sc27 and the SMARTTMspecific adapter primer Universal Primer Mix. Two different DNA fragments of 234 and 183 bp were amplified under standard PCR conditions. Both fragments were cloned into the pGem®T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced using primers from the polylinker of the vector. Applying the CLONTECH Genome Walker Kit, genomic libraries fromS. obliquus were generated by digestion with different blunt end cutting endonucleases (NaeI, DraI,PvuII, HincII, and EcoRV) and by adapter ligation at the ends of the resulting DNA fragments. These libraries were utilized as independent templates in five different PCR reactions (38Siebert P.D. Chenchik A. Kelogg D.E. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1087-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Two gene-specific primers (Sc27 and Sc35) derived from the hydA cDNA sequence of S. obliquus were used in combination with a kit adapter primer (AP1) in a first PCR reaction. Subsequently, 1 μl of the first PCR served as a template in a secondary PCR, applying two nested gene-specific primers (i-Sc10 and Sc32) along with a nested kit adapter primer (AP2). The resulting products were cloned into pGem®T-Easy and sequenced. Sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52761) Google Scholar). 40-liter cultures ofS. obliquus were grown heterotrophically. After centrifugation (10 min at 5000 × g), the pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of Tris acetate phosphate medium. The cells were anaerobically adapted by flushing the solution with argon for 1 h in the dark. All further purification steps were performed in an anaerobic chamber (Coylab, Ann Arbor, MI). The cells were disrupted in a 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm sodium dithionite by vortexing 3 min with glass beads. The further purification steps were made as described earlier for the isolation of the iron hydrogenase of C. reinhardtii(30Happe T. Naber J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Automated Edman degradation of the N-terminal site of the protein was performed with an Applied Biosystem model 477A sequencer with online analyzer model 120 A. Total RNA of S. obliquuswas isolated according to the method described earlier (40Johanningmeier U. Howell S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13541-13549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts (20 μg) were separated electrophoretically on 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde (41Sambrook J. Tritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with RNA probes labeled with DIG-dUTP using the in vitro transcription method. A 1.3-kilobase EcoRI cDNA fragment was used to detect transcripts of the hydAgene, whereas a DIG-dUTP-labeled cDNA encoding constitutively expressed plastocyanin (42Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was used as control. Hybridization reactions were carried out using protocols supplied by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nucleic acid and protein sequences were analyzed with the programs Sci Ed Central (Scientific Educational Software) and ClustalW (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55989) Google Scholar). The Blast server (44Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 25: 3389-3402Crossref Scopus (60210) Google Scholar) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethseda, MD) was used for data base searches. ThehydA open reading frame was amplified by PCR using the primer pair Sc29 and Sc30 containing flankingNdeI-BamHI sites. The PCR product was cloned into the pGem®T-Easy vector. After digestion withNdeI-BamHI, the hydA gene was cloned into the corresponding site of the pET9a expression vector (Promega) producing pLF29.2. The insert of pLF29.2 was sequenced confirming that the fragment contains the exact full coding region of the hydrogenase without transit peptide. E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was transformed with pLF29.2. Expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside at anA600 of 0.3. Pelleted cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, 4 mm EDTA, 16% glycine, 2% SDS, 2% mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 8m urea). After heating, the protein extract was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blot analyses were performed using antiserum against the iron hydrogenase of C. reinhardtii at 1:1000 dilution as described earlier (31Happe T. Mosler B. Naber J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Anaerobic adaptation is the most efficient way to induce hydrogenase activity in S. obliquus. Bubbling the alga culture in the dark with argon led to a dramatic increase (10-fold) of hydrogenase activity during the first 2 h. We purified the enzyme of S. obliquus to homogeneity by successive column chromatography. Because the enzyme is irreversible inactivated by lowest oxygen levels, all purification steps were performed under strictly anaerobic conditions and in the presence of reducing agents (dithionite). The purification scheme resulted in a 5200-fold purification of HydA with 5% recovery (data not shown). The most powerful step for purifying the protein was a Q-Sepharose high performance column chromatography with pH gradient elution. Gel filtration chromatography of hydrogenase on a calibrated Superdex-75 column resulted in a single activity peak corresponding to a molecular mass of 45 kDa. The monomeric structure of the enzyme could also be shown on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel after Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). The N-terminal sequence of HydA was determined by Edman degradation. The protein sequence (AGPTAECDRPPAPAPKAXHWQ) is, except for two amino acids, identical to the amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA data (AGPTAECDCPPAPAPKAPHWQ). In the course of our purification procedure, we never found a hint for a second hydrogenase in S. obliquus because the hydrogenase activity was never separated in several distinct fractions. Biochemical data show a high similarity of HydA to the iron hydrogenase from C. reinhardtii (Table I). The enzymes have a high temperature optimum of about 60 °C, are strongly inhibited by O2 and CO, and catalyze the H2evolution with a typical high specific activity. Experiments with inhibitors of translation on ribosomes (data not shown) and analysis of the gene structure (see below) show that HydA from S. obliquus is translated in the cytoplasm and then transported into the chloroplast.Table IBiochemical data comparison of purified iron hydrogenases from C. reinhardtii and S. obliquusC. reinhardtiiS. obliquusSize49 kDa44,5 kDaSpecific activity935 units/mg protein700 units/mg proteinTemperature optimum60 °C60 °CpH optimum6.97.3Localizationchloroplast stromachloroplastCoding sitenuclearnuclearpI value5.35.17KM value (MV)830 μm800 μmKM(ferredoxin)35 μmND1-aND, not determined.1-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Hydrogenase activity was determined in intact and broken cells after anaerobic adaptation. The integrity of the photosynthetic electron transport in the sonified cell preparation was demonstrated by the rate of oxygen evolution (154 μmol O2/mg Chl × h). This rate corresponds to 85% of the oxygen evolution measured with intact Scenedesmuscells. In S. obliquus, the hydrogen evolution is linked to the photosynthetic electron transport chain through PSI. As shown in Table II, the cells were still able to photoproduce hydrogen when electron flow of PSII was blocked by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. In contrast, addition of 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyle-p-benzochinone resulted in inhibition of the H2 production, thus giving evidence of the involvement of PSI in the supply of electrons to hydrogenase. The electron transport from PSI to ferredoxin was inhibited using the artificial electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. In this reaction, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol is reduced instead of ferredoxin, and the electron transfer to hydrogenase is interrupted.Table IIEffects of different photosynthetical inhibitors on hydrogenase activityHydrogenase activityunits/mg chlorophyllIntact cells (control)0.11+ DCMU (10−5m)0.10+ DBMIB (10−5m)0.005Broken cells0.1+ DCMU (10−5m)0.11+ DBMIB (10−5m)0.006+ DCPIP (10−4m)0.003+ sulfo-DSPD (10−4m)0.003+ α-PetF-antibody (1:1000)0.008After anaerobic adaptation, cells were harvested, diluted in fresh TAP medium, and incubated with inhibitors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” α-PetF-antibody was raised against spinach ferredoxin.

Hydrogenase activity was dramatically reduced (up to 30-fold) by the ferredoxin antagonist sulfo-disalicylidinepropandiamine (Table II). Similar results were achieved with α-PetF-antibodies that specifically recognize the ferredoxin protein. In both cases, the hydrogenase enzyme can not evolve hydrogen, thus demonstrating the role of ferredoxin as the obligatory electron donor for the hydrogenase reaction. The electron transfer properties of different plant-type ferredoxins were measured in vitro with dithionite as reducing reagent. The ferredoxin proteins of spinach, C. reinhardtii, andS. obliquus were comparable regarding their capability to reduce purified S. obliquus hydrogenase. In this assay, we obtained H2-evolving activities of 420, 390, and 350 units/mg protein with S. obliquus, C. reinhardtii, and spinach ferredoxin, respectively. No hydrogen production could be measured with other possible electron donors like cytochrome and NADPH. In D. desulfuricans the iron hydrogenase was reported to catalyze both hydrogen production and uptake with low potential multiheme cytochromes like cytochromec3 (17Nicolet Y. Piras C. Legrand P. Hatchikian E.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure. 1999; 7: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). To isolate the gene encoding a iron hydrogenase inS. obliquus, we isolated poly(A)+ RNA from cell cultures after 1 h of anaerobic adaptation. Isolated RNA was transcribed and amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using oligonucleotides derived from conserved regions within the C. reinhardtii hydA gene. 2T. Happe, unpublished results. The complete cDNA clone of 2609 bp was obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR. It contains an open reading frame of 1344 bp encoding a polypeptide of 448 amino acids (Fig. 1) followed by an extensive 3′-untranslated region of about 1100 bp. The coding region of S. obliquus hydA exhibits features common to other green algae such as high GC content (64.2%) and a characteristic putative polyadenylation signal, TGTAA, 15 bp upstream of the poly(A)+ sequence (45Silflow C.D. Chisholm R.L. Conner T.W. Ranum L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In an effort to examine the exon-intron structure and the promoter region of the hydA gene, about 5 kilobases of the genomic DNA from S. obliquus were sequenced. The gene comprises five introns with a total size of 1310 bp (Fig. 1) whose 5′ and 3′ ends contain typical plant splice donor and acceptor sites that follow the GT/AG rule. A genomic Southern blot was probed with a 750-bp PCR fragment to determine the copy number of the hydA gene (Fig.2). Single bands were observed in lanes with samples digested with HincII, EcoRV, andNdeI and a double band in the lane containing genomic DNA digested with SacI. The band migration positions matched the sizes predicted from the sequence of the hydA gene, indicating that HydA is encoded by a single copy gene (Fig. 2). The same hybridization pattern was observed even under low stringency conditions (hybridization temperature 50 °C; data not shown). The transcription start position was determined by primer extension using RACE-PCR and was found 139 bp upstream of the ATG start codon. We designed several primers within 100 bp of the 5′ end of the knownhydA cDNA to confirm the accuracy of the transcription initiation site. All of the sequenced PCR clones had the same 5′ ends at position +1. As described for other green algae genes, a highly conserved TATA box element upstream of the transcription starting point is absent (46Silflow C.D. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 25-40Google Scholar). However, the TACATAT motive at position −25 in a GC-rich region shows similarities to other TATA motives in C. reinhardtii and therefore might be involved in gene expression. The polypeptide derived from the cDNA sequence has a length of 448 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 48.5 kDa (44.5 kDa without transit peptide, respectively); consequently, HydA is the smallest hydrogenase protein known so far. The N terminus of HydA is basic and contains numerous hydroxylated amino acids and an Val-Xaa-Ala motive at position 35, a characteristic feature of chloroplast transit peptides (47Franzen L.G. Rochaix J.D. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,48Keegstra K. Cell. 1989; 56: 247-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The processed HydA protein is compared with four bacterial and two eukaryotic iron hydrogenases as shown in Fig.3. The homology in the C-terminal region of all proteins is quite striking. For example, the S. obliquus HydA protein shows 44% identity and 57% similarity to the C. pasteurianum iron hydrogenase (9Meyer J. Gagnon J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9697-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The H cluster inS. obliquus might be coordinated by four cysteine residues at positions 120, 175, 335, and 340. Other strictly conserved amino acid structures like FTSCCPGW (343), TGGVMEAALR (474), and MACPGGCXXGGGQP () probably define a pocket surrounding the active center as shown"

Evidence strongly indicates that NADPH oxidase is an enzyme system responsible for superoxide generation in osteoclasts. A membrane-bound subunit, p91, is the catalytic domain of NADPH oxidase. However, osteoclasts from p91 knockout mice still produce superoxide at a rate similar to that observed in wild type mice. This unexpected phenomenon prompted us to examine the osteoclasts for an alternative to the p91-containing oxidase. In this study, the cloning of a NADPH oxidase subunit (Nox 4) with 578 amino acids is reported. Nox 4 has 58% similarity in amino acids with the known p91 subunit of NADPH oxidase. Nox 4 is present and active in osteoclasts. Antisense oligonucleotides of Nox 4 reduced osteoclastic superoxide generation as well as resorption pit formation by osteoclasts. This new oxidase complex was present and functional in osteoclasts from p91 knockout mice, explaining the normal resorptive activity seen in the osteoclasts where no p91 is present.

The presence of superoxide production at the osteoclast-bone interface suggests a direct effect of superoxide in osteoclastic bone resorption (1Key L.L. Ries W.L. Taylor R.G. Hays B.D. Pitzer B.L. Bone. 1990; 11: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Key L.L. Wolf W.C. Gundberg C.M. Ries W.L. Bone. 1994; 5: 431-436Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of osteoclastic superoxide availability results in a reduction in bone resorption (3Darden A.G. Ries W.L. Wolf W.C. Rodriguiz R.M. Key L.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Ries W.L. Key L.L. Rodriguiz R.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Treatment with interferon γ, a stimulator of NADPH oxidase activity, corrects defective osteoclastic function in osteopetrotic, microphthalmic mice in vivo and in calvaria cultured from these animals (5Rodriguiz R.M. Key L.L. Ries W.L. Pediatr. Res. 1993; 33: 382-389Google Scholar). In patients with osteopetrosis, increased bone resorption was documented by a decrease in medullary bone (6Key L.L. Rodriguiz R.M. Willi S.M. Wright N.M. Hatcher H.C. Eyre D.R. Cure J.K. Griffin P.P. Ries W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1594-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Therefore, superoxide generation at the osteoclast-bone interface is necessary for optimal levels of bone resorption. NADPH oxidase, a common enzyme system that produces superoxide in white cell phagocytes, is also present and active in osteoclasts. Several studies suggest that NADPH oxidase is responsible for osteoclastic superoxide production (3Darden A.G. Ries W.L. Wolf W.C. Rodriguiz R.M. Key L.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Steinbeck M.J. Appel W.H. Verhoeven A.J. Karnovsky M.J. J.

However, in studies of p91 knockout mice, despite the absence of the p91 catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase, osteoclasts generate normal amounts of superoxide. X-ray bone density analysis demonstrates that the p91 knockout mice are not osteopetrotic, as would be expected if there were a severe defect in osteoclastic bone resorption (data not shown). In keeping with the normal superoxide production found in the osteoclasts from the p91 knockout mutants, a similar finding has been reported in the lung endothelium. Kubo et al. (9Kubo H. Morgenstern D. Quinlan W.M. Ward P.A. Dinauer M.C. Doerschuk C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2680-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) found that lung endothelial cells from p91 knockout animals generate normal amounts of superoxide. In these endothelial cells, the xanthine oxidase enzyme complex was found to be responsible for generating superoxide. In a study of human fibroblasts, a“second” NADPH oxidase was demonstrated in cells from a patient afflicted with chronic granulomatous disease, who had a mutation in the p91 gene. This fibroblastic oxidase differed immunologically and functionally from NADPH oxidase, substantiating the presence of an alternative oxidase (10Meier B. Jesaitis A.J. Emmendorffer A. Roesler J. Quinn M.T. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, in at least two cell types, superoxide generation by oxidases other than NADPH oxidase has been observed. In this study, we have searched for an alternative oxidase responsible for superoxide generation in the osteoclasts from p91 knockout mice. To accomplish this, a mouse EST1has been identified by searching a gene bank. This EST contains 46% amino acid identity with the C-terminal portion of mouse p91. A complete sequence was obtained by 5′-RACE. Expression of a new oxidase subunit, Nox 4, in the osteoclasts from p91 knockout mice was demonstrated. Finally, using antisense oligonucleotide disruption of the production of Nox 4, we have demonstrated that expression of Nox 4 is related to osteoclastic superoxide generation and bone resorption. Anti-Nox 4 antibody was generated at the Medical University of South Carolina facility using a unique peptide (SKTLHSLSNRNNSYGTKFEY). The rabbit anti-Nox 4 antibodies were further purified by a peptide affinity column. Preincubation of the serum with Nox 4 peptide (1 μg/ml) resulted in undetectable signals, suggesting the specificity of the antibody. NTB2 liquid photographic emulsion was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. ECL was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Using the mouse p91 sequence as a query to search the murine EST data base, a homologous sequence (accession no.AI746441) was found, which contained 46% identity in amino acid sequence to the C-terminal portion of mouse p91. To obtain a complete sequence, 5′-RACE was carried out using Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). PCR was performed using primer AP 1 and the gene-specific primer (5′-CTGCACACCCAGATAAAGTACAGTCTT-3′). A 1.5-kilobase pair PCR product was purified and cloned into a TA vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The clones containing the insert were sequenced to reveal the complete sequence for the Nox 4 mRNA. Osteoclasts were generated by the culture of mouse bone marrow cells for 1–2 weeks in α-minimal essential medium, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin containing 1 × 10−8m 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3and 25 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (11Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Akatsu T. Tanaka H. Shionome M. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 85-977PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was changed twice a week. Nonosteoclastic cells were removed by vigorous washings. Additional contaminating cells were removed by a brief digestion (5–10 min) with lipase and collagenase (1 mg/ml). We generated 10,000–100,000 osteoclasts from 10 mice. This cell population was 90% pure osteoclasts. These osteoclasts stained positively with TRAP and were able to make resorptive pits on bovine bone slices (Fig. 8). Antisense oligonucleotides were designed near the ATG start codon of mouse native p91 (5′-CTTCATTCACAGCCCAGTTC-3′) and Nox 4 (5′-AGCTCCTCCAGGACACCGCC-3′). Antisense and the corresponding sense oligonucleotides were synthesized as phosphorothiolated oligonucleotides and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (Integrated DNA Technology Inc., Coralville, IA). All oligonucleotides were designed with the help of the OLIGO program to minimize self-complementing and dimer formation. Osteoclasts were incubated with 25 μm oligonucleotides in α-minimal essential medium with 5% FBS. After 2 days of incubation, osteoclast viability was determined by exclusion of trypan blue from the cytoplasm. To demonstrate antisense oligonucleotide incorporation into osteoclasts, the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was used. Briefly, mouse osteoclasts were cultured on chamber slides. After removing nonadherent cells, osteoclasts were incubated with32P-labeled antisense oligonucleotide (50,000 cpm/ml, ∼0.14 nm). A slide incubated with 0.14 μmunlabeled oligonucleotide in addition to 32P-labeled antisense oligonucleotide was the negative control. At the end of incubation, osteoclasts were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with TRAP to identify multinuclear osteoclasts. Thereafter, slides were air-dried and dipped in NTB2 liquid photographic emulsion. After exposure within a light-tight box at 4 °C for 2–3 weeks, slides were then developed. The autoradiograms of osteoclasts incubated with the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide were examined under a microscope. The transfection efficiency of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was determined by the percentage of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide incorporated into osteoclasts. After being incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (200,000 cpm/ml), osteoclasts were stained by TRAP and the number of osteoclasts in each dish was determined. The radioactivity in cell lysates and supernatant removed from these cells was measured using a scintillation counter. The transfection efficiency is expressed as a percentage of32P-labeled oligonucleotide incorporated per 1 × 105 osteoclasts. Osteoclasts were cultured in 10-cm plastic culture dishes. After vigorously washing with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, nonosteoclastic cells were removed after a brief digestion with collagenase/dispase (1 mg/ml) for 5–10 min. The remaining attached cells were 90% pure multinucleated osteoclasts. These osteoclasts were incubated in a 25 μm solution of antisense oligonucleotides for 2 days. Thereafter, the osteoclasts (0.1–1 × 105) were lysed with 1× sample buffer. After a brief sonication, osteoclast lysates were loaded on 8% SDS acrylamide gel. After transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the membrane was incubated with anti-Nox 4 polyclonal antibody (1:2000). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) was used to identify the presence of the bound anti-Nox 4 antibody using ECL. Superoxide generation by individual osteoclasts was determined by NBT assays (1Key L.L. Ries W.L. Taylor R.G. Hays B.D. Pitzer B.L. Bone. 1990; 11: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, osteoclasts were incubated with NBT solution containing 2.0 mg/ml NBT, 35% FBS in RPMI 1640 medium for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, osteoclasts were fixed in 10% formalin. Stained osteoclasts were identified as multinuclear giant cells. Twenty randomly selected NBT-stained osteoclasts from each treatment were analyzed. The NBT staining intensity of individual osteoclasts was measured and quantified by microdensitometry using an inverted microscope (Olympus) equipped with a CCD camera. The camera images were displayed on a high resolution monitor (Sony), stored in a microcomputer (ALR, Inc., Irvine, CA), and analyzed using densitometry software (Cue 2d, Opelco). The specificity of the NBT reduction assay for measuring osteoclastic superoxide generation has been demonstrated previously (1Key L.L. Ries W.L. Taylor R.G. Hays B.D. Pitzer B.L. Bone. 1990; 11: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4Ries W.L. Key L.L. Rodriguiz R.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Bone resorption was determined by a pit assay as described (12Madyastha M. Yang S. Ries W. Key L.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts were isolated from the bone marrow of 4–6-day-old neonatal mice and placed on bovine bone slices for 0.5–1 h. After removing nonadherent cells by vigorous washing, osteoclasts attached to the bone slices were treated with antisense and sense oligonucleotides for 2 days. Triplicates of bone slices were kept for each experimental condition. At the end of incubation, the cells on the bone slices were first removed by gentle scraping and further treated with 1 m NH4OH (1 ml/well) for 30 min. Bone slices were then cleaned by untrasonication and stained with hematoxylin (0.1%) for 35–45 s. The resorption pits were identified using bright field reflected light microscopy. The plan area of resorption pits was measured and quantified using the Cue 2 (C2D) image analysis system (Opelco, Washington, DC) linked to the microscope. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using Student'st test. Bone resorption determined by a 45Ca release assay was performed (4Ries W.L. Key L.L. Rodriguiz R.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2-day-old mouse pups received subcutaneous injections of 0.5 μCi of 45CaCl2. Two days after injection, calvaria were removed and preincubated in 1 ml of BGJb medium with 10% FBS at 37 °C for 24 h to remove rapidly exchangeable45Ca. After two rinses with the medium, the calvaria were halved at the sagittal suture. One half of each calvarium was placed in BGJb medium with 5% FBS containing DPI (1 μm) or PTH (3 μg/ml). The other half of the calvarium was incubated with the medium only. The calvaria were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 2 days. The 45Ca released into the medium was counted. The calvarial bones were treated with 10% trichloric acid at 4 °C for 24 h, and the trichloric acid digests were counted. The resorption activity is expressed as a percentage of45Ca released into the medium, calculated by the ratio of the counts/min in the medium divided by the total counts/min (counts/min in the medium plus counts/min from bone digests). The results of the resorption assay are reported as the ratio of the experimental to the control percentage of 45Ca release. As shown by Table I, osteoclasts from p91(−/−) mutants produced an amount of superoxide similar to that produced by osteoclasts from wild type mice. In addition, no significant difference in bone resorption was found by comparing cultures from p91(−/−) and C57/Bl6 mice.Table IOsteoclastic superoxide generation and bone resorption in C57Bl/6 and p91(−/−) miceC57Bl/61-an, number of calvaria analyzed from three independent experiments.p91(−/−)1-an, number of calvaria analyzed from three independent experiments.Superoxide production (optical density)0.49 ± 0.020.47 ± 0.031-bNo significant difference.(n = 20)(n = 11)Bone resorption (experimental/control)1.07 ± 0.030.97 ± 0.061-bNo significant difference.(n = 31)(n = 8)1-a n, number of calvaria analyzed from three independent experiments.1-b No significant difference. Open table in a new tab The hypothesis that an alternative oxidase is present in osteoclasts from the p91(−/−) mutant was supported by a Southern blot (Fig. 1). In this experiment, a32-P-labeled cDNA fragment of the mouse p91 gene, encoding a FAD binding region, was hybridized to genomic DNA digested by a series of restriction endonucleases. Multiple bands were observed when the membrane was washed under conditions of low stringency. Moreover, some bands, identified under conditions of low stringency, disappeared when a high stringency wash was performed (lanes 1, 3, 4, and 5). The disappearance of the bands under high stringency conditions suggested the presence of a homologous, but nonidentical sequence(s) to the mouse p91. Using the mouse p91 sequence as a query to search the murine EST data base, a homologous sequence (accession no. AI746441) was found that had 46% identity with the C-terminal portion of mouse p91. A complete mRNA sequence (Nox 4, GenBank™ accession no. AF218723) was obtained by 5′-RACE. The predicted amino acid sequence is shown in Fig.2. Nox 4 has a predicted sequence containing 578 amino acids compared with 570 residues in murine p91. The two sequences have 58% similarity. Conserved regions containing FAD (13Sumimoto H. Sakamoto N.

Four histidine residues, which represent the conserved amino acid for a heme binding site (16Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), are also present in Nox 4. The expression of Nox 4 in osteoclasts from both p91(−/−) and C57bl/6 mice was determined by reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig.3, Nox 4 was expressed in osteoclasts from both animals. Densitometric analysis showed that osteoclasts from p91 knockout mutants contained 2.5 times as much of Nox4 as osteoclasts from the wild type mice. The expression of Nox 4 in leukocytes was also observed in both p91(−/−) and C57bl/6 mice (data not shown). In addition to its expression in osteoclasts and leukocytes, Nox 4 mRNA was expressed in the mouse kidney, liver, and lung (Fig. 4). In contrast, p91 mRNA was highly expressed in the mouse spleen (data not shown), suggesting that Nox 4 may have functions that are different from those of p91.Figure 4Tissue distribution of Nox 4. Poly(A) RNA was isolated from indicated mouse tissues. After separation by electrophoresis and transfer to a nylon membrane, the blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled Nox 4 probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When cultured osteoclasts were incubated with antisense oligonucleotide for 2 days, no significant difference in osteoclast viability was observed. As shown in Fig. 5, the majority of cells consist of TRAP-positive osteoclasts (panel B) and uptake of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides is observed in osteoclasts (panel A). The efficiency of osteoclastic uptake of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide is ∼10%. Expression of Nox 4 protein in osteoclasts was undetectable after incubation with Nox 4 antisense oligonucleotide, compared with the control (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effect of antisense oligonucleotide on Nox 4 protein expression. P91(−/−) osteoclasts were incubated with or without 25 μm Nox 4 antisense oligonucleotide for 2 days. Osteoclasts (0.1–1 × 105) were lysed with 1× sample buffer and the presence of Nox 4 protein was examined by Western blot. Lysates from white blood cells (100 μg) was included as a positive control (lane 1). A light band is observed in the osteoclast control sample (lane 2), while no detectable Nox 4 protein is present in samples treated with Nox 4 antisense oligonucleotide (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Osteoclastic superoxide generation was determined using an NBT assay. The addition of Nox 4 antisense oligonucleotide resulted in an 80% reduction of superoxide production for both C57Bl/6 and p91(−/−)osteoclasts (Fig. 7). A similar inhibition of superoxide production was observed in earlier studies, using the superoxide scavenger desferal manganese complex (4Ries W.L. Key L.L. Rodriguiz R.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, calcitonin, an inhibitor of osteoclastic function, blocks over 90% of superoxide production. The degree of inhibition of bone resorption by antisense oligonucleotides is shown in Tables IIand III. The number of bone resorption pits was reduced to ∼50% when antisense oligonucleotides of Nox 4 and p91 were included in the incubation medium (Fig. 8). The average resorption area for C57Bl/6 osteoclasts was reduced by 47% and 46%, respectively, by Nox 4 antisense (p < 0.01) and p91 antisense (p < 0.01). It is important to note that a combination of both the p91 and Nox 4 antisense oligonucleotides reduced resorption by 61% compared with the control and by an additional 27% compared with the Nox 4 alone. Furthermore, incubation with the antisense oligonucleotides reduced the bone resorptive activity of p91(−/−) mutants (Table III). These data suggest that both oxidases are active in osteoclast from the wild type mice and contribute to bone resorption. In addition, Nox 4 remains active in the osteoclasts from p91 knockout animals.Table IIEffect of antisense oligonucleotide on C57Bl/6 osteoclastic bone resorptionControlNox 4p91Nox 4 + p91DMnCCTASSSASSSASSSNumber of pits13763123771255311797Total area resorbed (μm2)254,17362,559225,33677,077224,87538,743226,39581097189Average resorbed area per pit (μm2)1855 ± 457993* ± 3081832† ± 6191001* ± 2871799† ± 638731* ± 2041935† ± 366901* ± 2671027* ± 252Data were collected from two separate experiments with a total of eight bone slices. *, p < 0.01 vs. control. †, NS vs. control.

The p91 subunit is a FAD-containing flavoprotein that transfers electrons to oxygen, producing superoxide. A flavoprotein inhibitor, DPI, has been shown to inhibit NADPH oxidase activity as a consequence of binding to the flavoprotein covalently, thus interrupting the electron transferring process (17O'Donnell V.B. Tew D.G. Jones O.T. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 18Doussiere J. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The sequence of Nox 4 reveals two conserved regions for FAD binding. To determine whether the Nox 4 complex requires the activity of the FAD-containing region for the production of superoxide, DPI inhibition was performed. Table IV shows that DPI inhibited not only osteoclastic superoxide generation, but also bone resorption in both the wild type and p91(−/−) mice. These data strongly suggest that a FAD-containing protein was responsible for the majority of the osteoclastic superoxide production in both wild type and p91(−/−) mice. The addition of PTH to the culture medium stimulated superoxide production and bone resorption. The PTH effect was markedly diminished by DPI in both types of osteoclasts.Table IVEffect of DPI on osteoclastic superoxide production and bone resorptionSuperoxide production (OD)Bone resorption (experimental/control)C57p91(−/−)C57p91(−/−)PTH (3 μg/ml)0.67 ± 0.020.70 ± 0.091.83 ± 0.091.33 ± 0.03(n = 10)(n = 15)(n = 18)(n = 8)DPI (1 μm)0.11 ± 0.044-aSignificant difference compared with control, p < 0.001.0.04 ± 0.034-aSignificant difference compared with control, p < 0.001.0.36 ± 0.074-aSignificant difference compared with control, p < 0.001.0.36 ± 0.044-aSignificant difference compared with control, p < 0.001.(n = 9)(n = 10)(n = 8)(n = 13)PTH + DPI0.23 ± 0.070.13 ± 0.030.82 ± 0.070.71 ± 0.02(n = 10)(n = 15)(n = 18)(n = 8)4-a Significant difference compared with control, p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab These studies demonstrate that Nox 4 is a p91-like protein that produces osteoclastic superoxide in p91(−/−) mice. The presence of this novel oxidase explains the ability of p91(−/−) osteoclasts to resorb bone normally. In wild type mice, both p91 and Nox 4 are expressed in osteoclasts. It is unclear why murine osteoclasts contain two enzymes that are involved in generating superoxide. Both enzymes may be active in the osteoclasts, due to the need for the production of large quantities of specifically targeted superoxide by the osteoclasts. Alternatively, the relatively low concentrations of Nox 4 in normal osteoclasts (Fig. 4) may suggest that Nox 4 is only expressed in large quantities when the NADPH oxidase is absent or nonfunctional (a 2.5-fold greater amount in p91(−/−) than in the wild type). It is also possible that the involvement of two enzyme systems is needed to effectively regulate osteoclastic superoxide production, allowing for sustained and controlled bone resorption. Generation of superoxide is a common function of phagocytes and osteoclasts. Superoxide produced by phagocytes plays an important role in bacterial killing and in normal host protection (19Jones O.T. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 919-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts generate superoxide that is necessary for bone resorption. Activated osteoclasts generate a ruffled-border space adjacent to bone which serves as the active site for bone resorption. Osteoclasts secrete hydrogen ions, proteinases, and superoxide into the ruffled border space to excavate a resorption pit or lacuna on the bone surface. Although an 80% decrease in superoxide generation was observed when antisense oligonucleotides were used to inhibit the production of the oxidase, bone resorption declined by ∼50%. Antisense oligonucleotides block superoxide generation, but acid production and protease secretion from osteoclasts are presumably not altered. Thus, osteoclasts continue to degrade bone, but the amount of bone resorption is decreased (2Key L.L. Wolf W.C. Gundberg C.M. Ries W.L. Bone. 1994; 5: 431-436Google Scholar, 4Ries W.L. Key L.L. Rodriguiz R.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In previous studies (4Ries W.L. Key L.L. Rodriguiz R.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Ries et al.reported that pits obtained in the presence of a superoxide scavenger still contained dangling collagen fibrils, while pits formed by control osteoclasts, in the absence of the scavenger, had a smooth surface. In the study, osteoclasts in the presence of the scavenger formed only one pit. Osteoclasts without the scavenger moved to form multiple pits. Thus, bone resorption activity is not halted in the absence of superoxide, but only reduced. This explains why there is a correlation between reduced superoxide production and bone resorption in the absence of a one to one relationship. Of great interest, patients with osteopetrosis have reduced, not absent bone resorption as evidenced by N-telopeptide excretion (6Key L.L. Rodriguiz R.M. Willi S.M. Wright N.M. Hatcher H.C. Eyre D.R. Cure J.K. Griffin P.P. Ries W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1594-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The defects in superoxide generation described in patients with osteopetrosis are related to the mechanisms that regulate oxidase activity, such as the regulatory components of the oxidase (20Yang S. Ries W. Key L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 199: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or the ability of cells to depolarize, triggering the activation of oxidases (21Beard C.J. Key L. Newburger P.E. Ezekowitz R.A Arceci R. Miller B. Proto P. Ryan T. Anast C. Simons E.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1986; 108: 498-505PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon current data, no explanation exists for the absence of reduced bone resorption in the p91 knockout animal or humans with chronic granulomatous disease. Perhaps it is possible to up-regulate Nox 4 (or its human counterpart) when the NADPH oxidase is defective, as suggested in the increased amount of Nox 4 mRNA present in p91 knockout animals (Fig. 3). In addition to being expressed and active in osteoclasts, the Nox4-containing oxidase does not appear to be stimulated to have the“oxidative burst” phenomenon observed in phagocytes, but rather a steady level of superoxide production (data not shown). Kinetic experiments have suggested that the NADPH oxidase is stimulated in bursts, both in white cells (22Chanock S.J. Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in osteoclasts (23Fallon M. Silverton S. Smith P. Moskal T. Constantinescu C. Feldman R. Golub E. Shapiro I. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; Suppl. I: 1Google Scholar). Thus, in the wild type animals, the greater bone resorption may result from a burst of superoxide production after the initial exposure to PTH, a time when the bulk of calcium release occurs in the calvarial calcium release assay (24Reynolds J.J. Dingle J.T. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1970; 4: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, by 48 h of incubation, a greater calcium release would be seen in the wild type cultures than in the p91(−/−) osteoclasts, despite a similar, post-stimulation level of superoxide production. The difference in the kinetics of the two enzymes would explain the difference in the amount of calcium released, but does not detract from the fact that PTH stimulates superoxide production and bone resorption significantly in both sets of cultures. The fact that the superoxide and the bone resorptive activity were decreased in osteoclasts from each animal by DPI, suggested that the stimulation of bone resorption required superoxide production. Since the p91(−/−) animals do not contain NADPH oxidase, the only conclusion to be drawn is that there was stimulation of bone resorption by the activity of the alternative oxidase. These observations are in keeping with the inhibition seen during the antisense overexpression, demonstrating that both the p91 and the Nox 4 contribute to osteoclastic superoxide production and bone resorption. Not only does superoxide directly contribute to bone resorption by facilitating the degradation of bone matrix proteins (4Ries W.L. Key L.L. Rodriguiz R.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), it is also involved in the activation and formation of osteoclasts (25Garrett I.R. Boyce B.F. Oreffo R.O. Bonewald L. Poser J. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). A number of reports have suggested that the types of physiological functions for the superoxide generated by different cell types are linked with cellular signaling and activation (26Brumell J.H. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 27Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol.

Superoxide has been shown to play a central role in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in osteoclasts (30Hall T.J. Schaeublin M. Jeker H. Fuller K. Chambers T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). NF-κB enhances the transcription of genes signaling osteoclastic activation. Thus, besides their destructive properties, superoxide and its related free radicals may be involved in mediation of cellular differentiation and activation. Modification of cellular differentiation and activation might explain why many nonphagocytic cells such as lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells produce superoxide. A group at Emory University (31Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar) reported an alternative oxidase (MOX) in human (AF127763) and rat (AF152963) tissues. The murine Nox 4 protein, reported here, has 56% similarity to MOX found in humans and 54% to that of the rat. The existence of oxidases, other than NADPH oxidase, in different species and tissues suggests that there is a biological role for these oxidases, perhaps in generating the appropriate amount or the targeted amounts of superoxide. The link between osteoclastic superoxide production and bone resorption has been underscored in a variety of studies (1Key L.L. Ries W.L. Taylor R.G. Hays B.D. Pitzer B.L. Bone. 1990; 11: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Key L.L. Wolf W.C. Gundberg C.M. Ries W.L. Bone. 1994; 5: 431-436Google Scholar, 3Darden A.G. Ries W.L. Wolf W.C. Rodriguiz R.M.

Oreffo R.O. Bonewald L. Poser J. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The absence of defective bone resorption by osteoclasts derived from p91 knockout animals would suggest that NADPH oxidase is not necessary for normal bone resorption. NADPH oxidase has been considered to be the oxidase responsible for all superoxide generation by osteoclasts (3Darden A.G. Ries W.L. Wolf W.C. Rodriguiz R.M. Key L.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Steinbeck M.J. Appel W.H. Verhoeven A.J. Karnovsky M.J. J.

The data presented here demonstrate that at least one additional oxidase, Nox 4, contributes to superoxide production and bone resorption by both p91 knockout and wild type murine osteoclasts. The nomenclature for a variety of non-myeloid NADPH oxidases has developed rapidly over the past 2 years. In Trends. Biochem. Sci. (25, 459–461, 2000), Lambeth et al. established a standardized nomenclature for the NADPH oxidases. Lambeth et al. sites our gene sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_015760, originally registered as AF218723 with the GenBank™ by Yang and Key in December, 1999) as the murine NOX4. Later, the identical gene sequence was registered by Geiszt et al. (GenBank™ AF261944) in April, 2000. The mouse NOX4 sequence was first published by Geiszt et al. in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97,8010–8014, 2000 (manuscript first submitted, March, 2000) and is the subject of the current report (Yang et al., manuscript first submitted February, 2000). Additionally, Geiszt et al.described the homologous human NOX4 sequence (GenBank™AF261943, registered on April, 2000) in their publication in theProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 8010–8014, 2000. The same sequence for human NOX4 was registered by Cheng and Lambeth et al. with the GenBank™ (AF254621) on April, 2000 and reported by Lambeth et al. in Trends Biochem. Sci. 25, 459–461, 2000.

These two yeasts often have distinct differences in carrying out the same cellular functions, which makes their comparative study especially revealing (25Forsburg S.L. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 340-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Upon starvation, S. pombe cells enter either the stationary phase or the sexual development pathway (reviewed in Ref. 26Davey J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1529-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We previously reported that rapamycin has a different effect on S. pombe compared with its effect on S. cerevisiae. Rapamycin does not inhibit the growth of S. pombe but specifically inhibits sexual development in response to starvation (27Weisman R. Choder M. Koltin Y. J Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6325-6334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step toward understanding the response to rapamycin in S. pombe, we cloned and initiated a functional analysis of the S. pombe TOR homologs, namedtor1 + and tor2 +. We show here that at least some of the functions of each of these TORs are distinct. Thus, tor2 + is essential for growth, whereas tor1 + is required only under starvation and other stress conditions. We also demonstrate that the conserved serine residue within the FRB domain of Tor1 is important for the protein function and does not play a detectable role in the response of starved S. pombe to rapamycin.

Open table in a new tab Cells were stained with the DNA fluorochrome propidium iodide and analyzed by a Becton Dickinson FACSort as described by (30Snaith H.A. Forsburg S.L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 839-851PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by Cell Quest software for Macintosh. A fragment containing 5.84 kbp of the C-terminal region oftor1 + gene was amplified by PCR using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with a genomicS. pombe DNA preparation as a template and the primers 104 (5′-TTGAAGAATCTGCAGCAATAAATATTC) and 105 (5′-AAGATTTGATCGGCATTTGGCAC). The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega) to give pGEMtor1. A 3.63-kbp HindIII fragment of pGEMtor1 containing the kinase and FRB-like domains was replaced with anHindIII fragment containing the entireura4 +, resulting in the plasmid ptor1::ura4. NotI and SacI were used to release the 4-kbp tor1::ura4 disruption fragment, and this was gel purified and transformed into the diploid TA07. Stable Ura4+ diploids were selected, and their DNA was extracted and subjected to PCR analysis with primers 105 and 137 (5′-TTGTAAATAGGATAGCCAGCACC), which lies 100 bp upstream of the 5′ end of the disruption construct. 0.4- and 0.5-kbp fragments containing the very 5′ and 3′ ends of thetor2 + open reading frame, respectively, were amplified by PCR, using genomic DNA as the template. The primers were: 152 (5′-ATAAGAGTCGACTCACAAGTGTTGTGAACTTGGTGG); 154 (5′-GGGGTACCGAGCTCATTCCTGCTTTTCAACCCAGG); 153 (5′-ATAAGAGTCGACAGATACGTGAAGAGGGGTGGTGAC); and 155 (5′-CGGGATCCGTTTCTGGTAGGTGACAGTCCC). The resulting 0.4- and 0.5-kbp PCR fragments were digested with KpnI andBamHI, respectively (sites are underlined in the sequence of the primers) and ligated with the 1.8-kbpkpnI-BamHI fragment containing the entireura4 + gene. The fragment containing theura4 + gene flanked bytor2 + sequences was amplified by PCR using 152 and 153 and used to transform the diploid strain TA07. The correct disruption of tor2 + was verified by PCR analysis using the primer 165 (5′-CGGGATCCCCATTTAATAGAGAAAGGGATATTAGC) that lies 32 bp upstream of the 5′ end of the disruption construct in combination with primer 135 (5′-GTTATAAACATTGGTGTTGGAACAG) that lies in theura4 + gene. The tor1 + andtor2 + gene were obtained using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with a genomicS. pombe DNA preparation as the template. For amplifyingtor2 + we used primers 152 (5′-ATAAGAGTCGACTCACAAGTGTTGTGAACTTGGTGG) and 153 (5′-ATAAGAGTCGACAGATACGTGAAGAGGGGTGGTGAC) (SalI sites used for subsequent cloning are underlined). For amplifyingtor1 + we used primers 141 (5′-CGGGATCCGCGGCCGCCAATGTGAATGCATATCTTTAGTCC) and 142 (5′-ACGCGTCGACTGCTCTGAAGTCAATTCCGAAGTG) (BamHI,NotI, and SalI sites used for subsequent cloning are underlined). The resulting 8.3-kbptor1 + and 8 kbp tor2 + PCR fragments were cloned into the S. pombe pIRT2 expression plasmid (31Booher R. Beach D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3523-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), resulting in pIRT2-tor1 + and pIRT2-tor2 +, respectively. To express tor1 + in S. cerevisiae we used pIRT2-tor1 + as a template in a PCR reaction with primers 143 (5′-CGGGATCCGTCTATCGTTTCACTCGCTCTC) (BamHI, for subsequent cloning is underlined) and primer 141. This reaction resulted in the amplification of a 7.4-kbp fragment that contains the tor1 + ORF, 30 and 300 bp upstream and downstream of the open reading frame, respectively. This fragment was cloned into the pCM190 S. cerevisiae expression vector (32Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), resulting in pCM190-tor1 +. The mutation at the conserved serine in the Tor1 FRB domain, S1843R, was created by site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). pIRT2-tor1 + served as a template in a PCR reaction with primers 145 (5′-TGCATCCTCAGGCATTGGTGTATTC) and 146 (5′-GAAAAATAAGCCTGACGAGCTTCCTCTAATC; mutations are in bold type). The resulting PCR product (220 bp) was gel purified and used as a primer for a second-round of PCR with primer 144 (5′-AATAGATCTCTCGTTGAGTCCTTCG). The resulting 1.58-kbp PCR product was cleaved with BglII and Bsu36I, whose restriction sites reside near the fragment ends. This fragment was used to replace the corresponding fragment in pIRT2-tor1 + and pCM190-tor1 +. We verified that only the desired mutation had occurred during PCR or cloning of theBglII/Bsu36I fragment by DNA sequence analysis. In addition, to further ascertain that the only defect of thetor1 S1834R resided in Ser1834, the plasmid carrying tor1 S1834R was cut withBglII/Bsu36I, and the 1.58-kbp fragment containing the site of the mutation was recovered. This fragment was used as the template in a PCR reaction performed to replace Arg1834 back with serine. The fragment containing Ser1834 was ligated back to theBglII/Bsu36I cut plasmid to reconstruct a wild type tor1 +. This tor1 +, derived from tor1 S1834R, fully restoredtor1 + function. The wild type and mutant tor1genes were amplified from the plasmids pIRT2-tor1 + and pIRT2-tor1 S1834R using the primers 141 (containing a BamHI site, see above) and 199 (ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCATGGAGTATTTTAGTGATCTAAAAAAC) (theNotI site is underlined). PCR products were digested withBamHI/NotI and cloned into theBglII/NotI sites of the thiamine-repressible vector pSLF273 (34Forsburg S.L. Sherman D.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 191: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), downstream and in frame with the plasmid sequences encoding the triple hemagglutinin (HA) epitope domain. The resulting plasmids carrying the N-terminal HA-tagged wild type and mutated proteins were transformed into a Δtor1 strain, TA163. Total protein extracts were prepared from cells growing under conditions that allow protein expression (in the absence of thiamine) following the method described by (28Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar). Aliquots of whole cell extracts containing 60 μg of protein were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to membrane filters. The immobilized proteins were detected using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences enhanced chemiluminescence system. The HA-tagged proteins were detected with monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Berkley Antibody Co.). Polyclonal antibodies raised againstS. cerevisiae FKBP12 (a kind gift of J. Heitman, Duke University Medical Center) were used to detect the S. pombeFKBP12 proteins as an internal loading control. The DNA sequence of most of the S. pombe genome has been determined through the coordination of the Sanger Center. Based on sequence comparisons, we identified two TOR homologs in chromosome II. We named one of these, on cosmid SPBC30D10, tor1 + and the second, contained on two overlapping cosmids, SPBC216 and SPBC646,tor2 +. The open reading frames oftor1 + and tor2 + encode for 2335- and 2337-amino acid proteins, respectively. No introns are found in either of the open reading frames. The two S. pombeTOR homologs share 52% overall identity. A slightly lower level of overall identity (42–44%) is revealed when the amino acids encoded bytor1 + or tor2 + are aligned with the human TOR, the S. cerevisiae Tor1p or Tor2p, or the C. neoformans Tor1. The C-terminal regions of the S. pombe Tor1 and Tor2 proteins contain the FRB and the phosphatidylinositol kinase-like domains and are the most conserved regions of the proteins. The C-terminal regions of Tor1 and Tor2, residues 1814–2171 and 1817–2174, respectively, show 64–65% identity with the corresponding amino acids of other TOR homologs in the data bases. Amino acid comparisons of these C-terminal regions indicate that both Tor1 and Tor2 in S. pombe contain the conserved structural features that characterize the TOR family of proteins. This includes the conserved serine at position 1834 or 1837 in Tor1 or Tor2, respectively (Fig.1). As a first step toward understanding the physiological function(s) of the TORs inS. pombe, we disrupted the chromosomal copies oftor1 + or tor2 + by one-step gene replacement (“Experimental Procedures”). Fig.2 shows a tetrad analysis of a heterozygous diploid strain (TA137) in which one of the copies oftor2 + was replaced with the selective markerura4 +. A total of 25 tetrads were dissected, and all yielded only two or one viable spores, none of which cosegregated with the ura4 + marker, indicating that thetor2 disruption was lethal. Microscopic examination revealed that in the nonviable segregants, the spores produced single cells that did not undergo cell divisions (data not shown). This lethal phenotype was rescued by reintroduction of tor2 +. Strain TA137 transformed with plasmid pIRT2-tor2 +(tor2 + expressed under the regulation of its endogenous promoter) was sporulated and dissected. Progeny disrupted in the chromosomal copy of tor2 + were obtained, but in all cases they carried the plasmid-borne wild typetor2 + gene. We also used the ura4 + selective marker to disrupt tor1 + (“Experimental Procedures”). In contrast to tor2 disruption, sporulation of diploid heterozygous for tor1 + disruption (TA82) yielded viable Ura4+ haploids. PCR analysis confirmed that the Ura4+ haploids carried a disputed allele of tor1(data not shown). Thus, whereas tor2 + is an essential gene, tor1 + is a nonessential gene. We further analyzed two independently isolated Δtor1 haploid clones. Under optimal growth conditions, the growth rate and cell morphology ofΔtor1 cells were indistinguishable from that of wild type cells (Fig. 3 A). However, Δtor1 cells exited the logarithmic phase at a lower cell density, were abnormally long, and lost viability rapidly (Fig. 3). The loss of viability of Δtor1depends on the growth medium. Whereas Δtor1cells died when they reached saturation in rich medium, they maintained viability comparable with wild type cells when grown to saturation in minimal medium (Fig. 3 B). This suggests thatΔtor1 cells are defective in the response to particular sets of conditions rather than in the actual cellular processes that allow cells to acquire the stationary phase physiology. We also noted that Δtor1 cells failed to cross with wild type strains. Microscopic examination suggested a defect at an early stage of sexual development, before conjugation had occurred. Media limiting for either nitrogen or carbon sources are conventionally used for a quantitative analysis of conjugation (mating). Under these conditions, haploid cells of the opposite mating types can conjugate to form a diploid zygote, which rapidly undergoes meiosis and sporulation and produces an ascus (reviewed in Ref. 26Davey J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1529-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Under either nitrogen or carbon starvation, ∼60% of wild type cells underwent mating compared with less than 1% of Δtor1 cells. The sterile phenotype of Δtor1 was efficiently suppressed when we reintroducedtor1 + (Fig.4 A). Nitrogen or carbon starvation is also a signal for diploid cells to enter meiosis (reviewed in Ref. 26Davey J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1529-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Under these conditions most of the wild type diploid cells, >60%, underwent sporulation, whereas <1% of homozygous Δtor1 diploids sporulated (results not shown). Thus, in addition to its role in mating,tor1 + is also required for meiosis/sporulation. Analysis of the DNA content of growing and starved Δtor1cells also indicates that these cells are defective in their response to starvation. In the absence of a mating partner, starved S. pombe cells become arrested in either G1 or G2, depending on the growth medium; nitrogen starvation arrests cells mainly at the G1 phase, and carbon starvation arrests cells mainly at the G2 phase (35Costello G.F. Rodegers L. Beach D. Curr. Genet. 1986; 11: 119-125Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The DNA profile of Δtor1 cells under optimal growth conditions shows a major 2n DNA peak, characteristic of growing wild type cells (see Refs. 36Moreno S. Nurse P. Nature. 1994; 367: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar and 37Takeda T. Toda T. Kominami K. Kohnosu A. Yanagida M. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6193-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and Fig. 4 B). However, under nitrogen starvation, Δtor1 cells show an abnormal DNA profile as cells failed to arrest in G1 (Fig. 4 B). Because G1 arrest is a prerequisite for mating, the failure of Δtor1 cells to arrest their growth in G1 may be associated with their inability to undergo sexual development. We noted that the phenotype of Δtor1 cells was particularly similar to that of cells disrupted for atf1 +, a gene that encodes a bZIP (basic leucine zipper) transcription factor (37Takeda T. Toda T. Kominami K. Kohnosu A. Yanagida M. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6193-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Under starvation conditions, both Δtor1 and Δatf1 cannot arrest in G1, exhibit an abnormal elongated morphology, lose viability in rich but not minimal medium, and are sterile.atf1 + has also been implicated in regulating the cellular response to a variety of stress conditions, such as cold, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress (37Takeda T. Toda T. Kominami K. Kohnosu A. Yanagida M. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6193-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 38Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 39Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toone W.M. Shieh J.C. Toda T. Millar J.B. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We found thattor1 + is also required under these stress conditions; unlike wild type cells, Δtor1 could not form colonies on medium containing 0.5 m NaCl or 1 mKCl (Fig. 4 C) or on medium containing 5 mmH2O2 (Fig. 4 D) or below 20 °C (results not shown). Taken together, our findings reveal a striking similarity between the phenotypes of Δtor1 and Δatf1 cells. It remains to be determined whethertor1 + and atf1 + are involved in the same signaling pathway. We previously reported that rapamycin specifically inhibits sexual development in S. pombe (27Weisman R. Choder M. Koltin Y. J Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6325-6334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated above, Δtor1 cells are unable to undergo sexual development. Because rapamycin is known to inhibit the TOR proteins in mammals, S. cerevisiae, and C. neoformans, we considered the possibility that rapamycin exerts its effect by inhibiting the function of the S. pombe Tor1 during sexual development. A conserved serine residue in TORs has been identified as the site for missense mutations (serine substituted with arginine, isoleucine, or glutamic acid) conferring dominant rapamycin resistance (see the Introduction). We mutated the equivalent serine residue inS. pombe Tor1, Ser1834, into arginine (“Experimental Procedures”). The tor1 +and tor1 S1834Rgenes, cloned into the S. pombe expression vector pIRT2 (“Experimental Procedures”) were transformed into Δtor1 strains TA99 or TA157. TA99 and TA157 are isogenic except that TA157 is a homothallic strain (cells can switch their mating types between h + andh − every other generation), whereas TA99 is a heterothallic strain composed of h− cells only. Surprisingly, we found that the mutation at Ser1834diminished the activity of Tor1; the mating efficiency was extremely low when TA157 cells carrying tor1 S1834R were induced to undergo mating (0.9%, Fig.5 A). In crosses between wild type and Δtor1 cells (TA99) carryingtor1 S1834R, we observed that the wild type cells partially suppressed the sterility of Δtor1 cells carryingtor1 S1834R (Fig. 5 A). The mutation S1834R also diminished the activity of Tor1 under osmotic stress conditions (Fig. 5 C) or in acquisition of stationary phase physiology (data not shown). Because mating is very inefficient intor1 S1834R mutants, it was no surprise that this mutated allele did not confer dominant resistance to rapamycin in wild type TA16 transformants (Fig. 5 B). Our finding that Ser1834 is critical for the function of Tor1 is surprising given that equivalent mutations did not affect TOR function in S. cerevisiae. To ascertain that the only defect of the tor1 S1834R resided in S1834, the plasmid carrying tor1 S1834R was used as the template in a PCR reaction performed to replace Arg1834 back with serine (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thistor1 +, derived fromtor1 S1834R, fully restoredtor1 +, demonstrating thattor1 S1834R carries no mutations other than S1834R. We also examined whether the mutation at S1834 affected protein stability. To this aim, the wild type and mutated Tor1 proteins were tagged with the HA epitope (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis of Δtor1 cells expressing these proteins demonstrated that the HA tagging did not affect the activity of the proteins in vivo (data not shown). Western blot analysis using antibody raised against the HA epitope demonstrated that the level of Tor1 and Tor1S1834R are comparable (Fig.6). Therefore, we conclude that the S1834R mutation did not affect protein stability in vivo, but rather the S1834 residue is required for the function of Tor1 under starvation or osmotic stress conditions. Because the S. pombe tor1 + shows a significant level of homology with the S. cerevisiae TOR genes (about 43% identity), we examined the functions of the S. pombe tor1 + and tor1 S1834R inS. cerevisiae. Plasmids carryingtor1 + or tor1 S1834R, expressed under the control of the S. cerevisiae ADH1promoter, were introduced into wild type S. cerevisiaecells. Fig. 7 shows thattor1 S1834R but not tor1 +conferred dominant rapamycin resistance in S. cerevisiae. This is similar to the effect of equivalent point mutations in theS. cerevisiae TOR proteins (3Cafferkey R. Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Bergsma D.J. Koltin Y. Sathe G.M. Faucette L. Eng W.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27531-27537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), except thattor1 S1834R did not confer rapamycin resistance at a high concentration of rapamycin (100 ng/ml, results not shown). The dominant resistance exhibited by the S. pombe tor1 S1834R indicates that the S. pombe TOR homolog can complement the function of the S. cerevisiaeTORs. It also implies that the conserved serine intor1 + is critical for the binding of FKBP12-rapamycin when expressed in S. cerevisiae cells. In conclusion, it appears that although S1834 is required for Tor1 function in S. pombe, it is not required for the rapamycin-sensitive TOR function of S. cerevisiae. We report here the identification and initial characterization of the S. pombe homologs of the TOR genes. We found theS. pombe tor2 + gene is essential for growth, whereas tor1 + is required only under starvation, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress. The inability of Δtor1 cells to respond appropriately to starvation conditions may suggest that the S. pombe tor1 +, like its S. cerevisiae TOR homologs (2Cardenas M.E. Cruz M.C. Del Poeta M. Chung N. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 583-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Cutler N.S. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 155: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), participates in signal transduction pathways that are involved in nutrient sensing. However, there are significant differences between the functions of the S. cerevisiae and S. pombeTORs. First, the S. pombe tor1 + has a positive role in the sexual development pathway and entry into stationary phase, whereas the activity of the S. cerevisiae TORs is required to repress meiosis (41Zheng X.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3070-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and entry into stationary phase (6Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I.

A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Second, the S. pombe tor1 + is required for the appropriate response to a variety of stress conditions, whereas there is no evidence that the S. cerevisiae TOR homologs are involved in the response to stresses other than starvation. Third, each of the two S. pombe TOR homologs carries out a distinct function that is not shared by the other homolog. In contrast, theS. cerevisiae TOR1 is a nonessential gene, and its function in regulating growth in response to nutrient availability is shared with TOR2 (3Cafferkey R. Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Bergsma D.J. Koltin Y. Sathe G.M. Faucette L. Eng W.K. Johnson R.K. Livi G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6012-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 4Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U.

Mutational analysis of tor1 + revealed that the conserved serine residue within the FRB domain of Tor1 plays a critical role in the protein cellular function. Thus, although the mutation at Ser1834 did not affect the level of protein expression (Fig. 6), tor1 S1834R can only partially complement the defects observed in Δtor1 cells (Fig. 5). Although Ser1834 is required for Tor1 function, its equivalent serine residues in the S. cerevisiae TOR proteins (3Cafferkey R. Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Bergsma D.J. Koltin Y. Sathe G.M.

However, given the conserved nature of this serine residue, its role in other TOR homologs may become evident under yet unidentified conditions. None of the functions of the S. pombe TORs described in this work appear to be inhibited by rapamycin. Rapamycin specifically inhibits sexual development in S. pombe, at an early stage, before mating (27Weisman R. Choder M. Koltin Y. J Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6325-6334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells disrupted for tor1 +are deficient in their ability to undergo mating. However, the effects of Tor1 and rapamycin on sexual development appear to be unrelated. The inability of Δtor1 cells to enter sexual development seems to be part of a general defect in responding to nutritional deprivation. Thus, Δtor1 cells fail to enter stationary phase, arrest in G1 in response to starvation, or undergo meiosis/sporulation. In contrast, rapamycin specifically inhibits the sexual development pathway and does not interfere with other responses to starvation. Thus, cells treated with rapamycin can enter stationary phase properly, are only slightly defective in meiosis/sporulation (27Weisman R. Choder M. Koltin Y. J Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6325-6334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and can arrest their growth in G1 under starvation conditions. 2R. Weisman and M. Choder, unpublished results. Our finding thattor1 S1834R could not alleviate the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on sexual development (Fig. 5 B) is consistent with our suggestion that rapamycin does not exert its effect in S. pombe by forming a toxic FKBP12-rapamycin complex that inhibits the Tor1 function. If neither Tor1 nor Tor2 is the protein target for rapamycin, than what is the target for the action of rapamycin in S. pombe? Recent findings in our lab show that cells disrupted for the S. pombe FKBP12 homolog exhibit a phenotype highly similar to treatment with rapamycin. Thus, it is most probable that rapamycin inhibits sexual development by inhibiting the cellular function of FKBP12 in sexual development 3R. Weisman, S. Finkelshtein, and M. Choder, manuscript in preparation. and not by inhibiting TOR-related function. Why rapamycin does not inhibit neither the function of Tor1 or Tor2? Our functional analysis of tor1 + andtor1 S1834R in S. cerevisiae cells (Fig. 5 A) suggests that Tor1 can bind the FKBP12-rapamycin complex, at least in S. cerevisiae cells. It is possible that Tor1 interacts with FKBP12-rapamycin complexes in S. pombe, but this interaction does not inhibit the studied functions of Tor1 or Tor2. By analogy, the function of the S. cerevisiae Tor2p in the control of the actin cytoskeleton organization is not inhibited by rapamycin (5Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The features of S. pombe TOR proteins, together with other studies of TOR functions, indicate that these proteins are involved in many distinct cellular functions. Given that the C-terminal region containing the FRB and the kinase domains of the TORs is highly conserved, the differences between the TORs might reside in the less conserved N-terminal region. This is an intriguing possibility yet to be explored. We thank J. Heitman for S. cerevisiae strains and antibodies against S. cerevisiaeFKBP12. We thank M.

https://openalex.org/W2036023681,"αB-crystallin in cells can be phosphorylated at three serine residues in response to stress or during mitosis (Ito, H., Okamoto, K., Nakayama, H., Isobe, T., and Kato, K. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 29934–29941 and Kato, K., Ito, H., Kamei, K., Inaguma, Y., Iwamoto, I., and Saga, S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 28346–28354). In the present study, we determined effects of phosphorylation of αB-crystallin on its oligomerization state, mainly by using site-directed mutagenesis, in which all three phosphorylation sites were substituted with aspartate to mimic the phosphorylation state (3D-αB). From results of sucrose density gradient centrifugation, we found that wild type αB-crystallin (wt-αB) and 3D-αB sedimented in fractions corresponding to apparent molecular masses of about 500 and 300 kDa, respectively. Chaperone-like activity of 3D-αB was significantly weaker than that of wt-αB. When wt-αB and 3D-αB were expressed in COS-m6 cells, they sedimented at positions corresponding to apparent molecular masses of about 500 and 100 kDa, respectively. In U373 MG human glioma cells, αB-crystallin was observed as large oligomers with apparent molecular masses about 500 kDa and the oligomerization size was reduced after phosphorylation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and okadaic acid. Coexpression of luciferase and wt-αB or 3D-αB in Chinese hamster ovary cells caused protection of the enzyme from heat inactivation although the degree of protection with 3D-αB was less than that with wt-αB. From these observations, it is suggested that phosphorylation of αB-crystallin causes dissociation of large oligomers to smaller sizes molecules and reduction of chaperone-like activity, like in the case of HSP27. αB-crystallin in cells can be phosphorylated at three serine residues in response to stress or during mitosis (Ito, H., Okamoto, K., Nakayama, H., Isobe, T., and Kato, K.

Many of them play pivotal roles in the maintenance of cellular functions. Among them, the p44/42 MAP1 kinase and p38 MAP kinase cascades are well known for their roles, for example, in cell proliferation and stress responses (1Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 2Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These kinases phosphorylate many proteins in response to extracellular stimuli. Small heat shock or stress proteins (sHSPs) have been recognized as substrates for p44/42 MAP kinase and p38 MAP kinase cascades and it is suspected that phosphorylation of sHSPs may cause significant change in their functions. Phosphorylation of HSP27 in response to extracellular stimuli such as heat, arsenite, phorbol ester, and growth factors is well characterized (3Arrigo A.-P. Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15359-15369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Arrigo A.-P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 5Landry J. Chretinen P.

Shanmugam M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We previously reported that phosphorylation of HSP27 in cells leads to dissociation of large oligomers and decrease of resistance to heat (11Kato K. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11274-11278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, other groups documented that substitution of serine phosphorylation sites of HSP27 with aspartate or glutamate similarly results in the reduction of oligomer size, with cells expressing these mutants showing reduced tolerance to exogenous stress (12Lambert H.

HSP27 has been recognized as an actin-binding protein, with activity that modifies the polymerization state of actin (14Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Liang P. MacRae T.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of HSP27 causes loss of its actin polymerization inhibiting activity (16Benndorf R. Hayess K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of αB-crystallin, another representative sHSP, has not been reported in response to extracellular stimuli although it was found that significant amounts of phosphorylated forms are present in mammalian lens and the phosphorylation is catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (17Spector A. Chiesa R. Sredy J. Garner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4712-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 18Voorter C.E. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Roersma E.S. Meyer H.E. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We first reported that αB-crystallin is also phosphorylated in response to extracellular stimuli, which also induce phosphorylation of HSP27, with three serine residues, Ser-19, Ser-45, and Ser-59, as phosphorylation sites (19Ito H. Okamoto K. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We also described phosphorylation of Ser-45 and Ser-59 to be catalyzed by p44/42 MAP kinase and MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2, respectively (20Kato K. Ito H. Kamei K. Inaguma Y. Iwamoto I. Saga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28346-28354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is known that αB-crystallin can prevent cytochalasin-induced depolymerization of actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, although the phosphorylation does not affect its chaperone-like activity (21Wang K. Spector A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). αB-crystallin also modulates intermediate filament assembly independent of its phosphorylation state (22Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of αB-crystallin at Ser-45 occurs in mammalian mitotic cells (20Kato K. Ito H. Kamei K. Inaguma Y. Iwamoto I. Saga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28346-28354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and phosphorylated forms, especially at Ser-45, increase in rat lens during postnatal development (23Ito H. Iida K. Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Kato K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effects of phosphorylation of αB-crystallin on its oligomerization state using site-directed mutagenesis to substitute all three phosphorylation sites with aspartate to mimic the phosphorylation state. We found this to cause changes of the oligomerization state of αB-crystallin and decrease in its chaperone-like activity. For expression in mammalian cells, an Eco RI fragment from human αB-crystallin cDNA (generously provided by Dr. A. Iwaki, Kyushu University, Japan) was inserted into the expression vector pCMV5 (generously provided by Dr. H. Itoh, National Children's Medical Research Center, Japan) (24Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For site-directed mutagenesis, we used the polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide mutation primers and the template αB-crystallin expression vector.Bgl II and Xho I fragments from polymerase chain reaction fragments were inserted into Bgl II andSal I sites of pCMV5. We constructed two plasmids to express wild type αB-crystallin and αB-crystallin in which three phosphorylation sites, Ser-19, Ser-45, and Ser-59, were substituted with aspartate. We designated these plasmids as wt-αB-pCMV5 and 3D-αB-pCMV5. The mutated sites were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expression of wt-αB and 3D-αB in Escherichia coli, their cDNAs were inserted into Nde I and Xho I sites of the vector pET30a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Recombinant human αB-crystallin and its mutant were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The production of recombinant protein was induced as follows; the cells were grown with shaking at 37 °C until the culture had A 600 of 0.6 and 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside was added. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in an extraction buffer, 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.3 mg/ml Pefablock SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. Each suspension was sonicated at 0 °C and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a column of Sepharose beads which coupled with affinity purified antibodies against C-terminal peptides of αB-crystallin (25Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and then the column was washed with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. αB-crystallin trapped on the column was eluted with ActiSep Elution Medium (Sterogen, Arcadia, CA). The eluate was desalted and mixed with equal volume of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 7m urea, 1 mm EDTA and then applied to a column (0.8 cm, inner diameter × 7.5 cm) of TSK-SP-5PW (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). αB-crystallin was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.4 m) in the above buffer as described previously (19Ito H. Okamoto K. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-725 spectropolarimeter. Samples of wt-αB and 3D-αB purified from bacteria were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and used at concentrations of 450 and 45 μg/ml for near and far UV CD spectrometry, respectively. The path length of the cell was 10 mm for both spectrometry. Near and far UV CD spectra were accumulated 5 and 3 times, respectively. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra were recorded using a JASCO FP-770 fluorescence spectrophotometer with the excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Samples containing 50 μg/ml wt-αB and 3D-αB in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were used in 10-mm path length cuvettes. The excitation and emission band passes were set at 3 nm. Spectra were monitored from 300 to 400 nm at room temperature. For the 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (ANS) binding studies, 10 μl of 10 mm ANS (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) was added to 3 ml of 50 μg/ml protein solution in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Samples were transferred to 10-mm path length cuvettes and fluorescence spectra were monitored. The excitation and emission band passes were set at 5 nm. The excitation wavelength was set at 350 nm and spectra were monitored from 400 to 600 nm at room temperature. For determination of oligomerization size of recombinant αB-crystallin, we performed gel filtration chromatography with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl. A calibration curve was generated by using a high molecular weight protein standard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chaperone-like activity was measured as the ability to protect against heat-induced aggregation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 100 μg/ml, purified from rabbit muscle, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), monitored by measuring the turbidity at 360 nm at 50 °C in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and 2 mm EDTA for 60 min in the presence or absence of 5 or 10 μg/ml recombinant αB-crystallin. We also performed luciferase refolding assays in vitro in the presence of recombinant αB-crystallin with the method described by Lu and Cyr (26Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase (14 mg/ml) (Promega, Madison, WI) was diluted 42-fold into denaturation buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 6 mguanidium HCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). The denaturation reaction was allowed to proceed for 40 min at room temperature. Two-microliter aliquots were removed from the denaturation mixture and mixed with 100 μl of refolding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm ATP) in the presence or absence of 1 μm recombinant αB-crystallin and the mixtures were incubated at 30 °C. Two-microliter aliquots were removed at various times and mixed with 60 μl of luciferase assay reagents (PicaGene Luminescence Kit; Toyo Ink Co., Japan). Relative light units were counted using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Tuner Designs, CA). COS-m6 cells and CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Equitech-Bio, Inc., Ingram, TX). Cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes and transfected with 1 μg of plasmids by using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection and suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mNaF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.3 mg/ml Pefablock SC, 0.2 μm okadaic acid, and 0.2 μm calyculin A. Each suspension was sonicated at 0 °C and centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain soluble extracts of cells. For phosphorylation of αB-crystallin by extracellular stimuli, we used U373 MG human glioma cells grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.). Cells were seeded in 90-mm dishes and when they reached confluence, they were treated for 90 min at 37 °C with 0.1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 0.1 μm okadaic acid (Wako Pure Chemical), and then cell extracts were obtained as described above. Ten μg of purified recombinant αB-crystallin in 0.2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaF and 5 mm EDTA or extracts of cells (0.2-ml aliquots) were layered over 3.6-ml linear gradient of sucrose (10–40%) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaF and 5 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C in a swinging bucket rotor (RPS56T; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Each sample was then fractionated into 15 test tubes from the bottom. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204264) Google Scholar) in 12.5% gels and proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Isoelectric focusing was carried out as described by O'Farrell (28O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the Protean II system from Bio-Rad (19Ito H. Okamoto K. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as described previously using affinity purified antibodies raised in rabbits against the C-terminal decapeptide of αB-crystallin (25Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) or against phosphopeptides which correspond to the three phosphorylation sites of αB-crystallin (p19S, p45S, and p59S) (19Ito H. Okamoto K. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-labeled antibodies raised in goat against rabbit IgG was employed as the second antibodies. Peroxidase activity on nitrocellulose sheets was visualized on x-ray films using a Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). In some experiments, peroxidase activity was also detected with the aid of a luminoimage analyzer LAS-1000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) and the relative densities of protein bands were quantified with relevant software. We also quantified relative densities of bands on x-ray films using an NIH image program (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). CHO cells were transiently co-transfected with two plasmids, 0.5 μg of wt-αB-pCMV5 or 3D-αB-pCMV5 and 0.5 μg of the luciferase expression vector, PGV-C (Toyo Ink Co.). Almost equal amounts of wt-αB and 3D-αB were expressed in CHO cells at 24 to 48 h after transfection as detected by Western blot analysis of cell extracts with antibodies against the C-terminal peptide of αB-crystallin under our experimental conditions (data not shown). When cells reached confluence, they were subjected to heat treatment at 45 °C for 70 min and then cultured at 37 °C for 16 h. Cells were harvested and the luciferase activity in cell extracts was measured using a PicaGene Luminescence Kit (Toyo Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bovine αB1-crystallin (phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin) and αB2-crystallin (unphosphorylated form of αB-crystallin) were purified from bovine lens as described previously (25Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Concentrations of protein were estimated with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. To estimate the effects of phosphorylation of αB-crystallin on its oligomerization state, we expressed recombinant proteins in E. coli. Wild type αB-crystallin (wt-αB) and 3D-αB-crystallin (3D-αB), in which all three phosphorylation sites of αB-crystallin, Ser-19, Ser-45, and Ser-59, were substituted with aspartate to mimic the phosphorylated state, were purified using a column of Sepharose beads coupled with antibodies against the C-terminal peptide of αB-crystallin and subsequent anion exchange chromatography. Purified wt-αB was observed at the position of the predicted molecular size in SDS-PAGE gels and 3D-αB was detected as a band migrating to a position pointing to a slightly greater kilodalton value (Fig.1 A). Using these recombinant proteins, far and near UV CD spectra were measured to estimate the effect of phosphorylation of αB-crystallin on its secondary and tertiary structure. Consistent with a previous report, wt-αB showed a far UV CD spectrum with a high percentage of β-sheet/β-turn structure in its molecule at 25 °C (Fig. 1 B). The 3D-αB also showed a far UV CD spectrum indicating a high percentage of β-structures at 25 °C and the pattern of the spectrum was similar to that of wt-αB (Fig. 1 B). To estimate the effect of phosphorylation of αB-crystallin on its conformational stabilities against temperature increasing, we monitored far UV CD spectrum at a higher temperature. At 45 °C, far UV CD spectra for wt-αB and 3D-αB were significantly changed and the extent of the change was more visible in the case of 3D-αB (Fig. 1 C). The near UV CD spectra of proteins are thought to reflect the contribution of aromatic amino acid to protein tertiary structure. The pattern of near UV CD spectra of wt-αB and 3D-αB were visibly different at 25 and 45 °C (Fig. 1, D and E). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectrum is thought to provide information of the environment of tryptophan residues in proteins. We also monitored fluorescence spectra of wt-αB and 3D-αB and it was revealed that the spectrum of 3D-αB was significantly shifted to the longer wavelength and the intensity of fluorescence increased (Fig.2 A), indicating a difference of the environment of tryptophan residues in wt-αB and 3D-αB and a decrease in the extent of hydrophobicity of 3D-αB. To estimate the extent of hydrophobicity of wt-αB and 3D-αB, we carried out ANS binding assays. ANS fluorescence is weak in aqueous solutions and its fluorescence quantum yield increases in a hydrophobic environment. This property of ANS has been exploited to monitor the hydrophobic surface of proteins (29Cardamone M. Puri N.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the fluorescence intensity of ANS bound to 3D-αB was lower than that bound to wt-αB, indicating a smaller extent of hydrophobicity of 3D-αB than that of wt-αB and the results were consistent with the results of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2 A). We previously reported one representative small heat shock protein, HSP27, to be phosphorylated by various stresses, with a resultant decrease in oligomerization size and increase in the dissociated form (11Kato K. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11274-11278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To estimate oligomerization states of recombinant wt-αB and 3D-αB, we fractionated each preparation of αB-crystallin by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Aliquots of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunostaining with antibodies against the C-terminal peptide of αB-crystallin. As shown in Fig.3 A, oligomerization states of wt-αB and 3D-αB were quite different. Quantitation of the intensity of bands of Western blot analysis revealed that wt-αB mainly sedimented at a position which corresponded to an apparent molecular mass of about 500 kDa, while 3D-αB mainly sedimented at a position which corresponded to apparent molecular masses of about 300 kDa, with a broader range (Fig. 3 B). We also estimated oligomerization sizes of wt-αB and 3D-αB using gel filtration chromatography and it revealed that the oligomerization sizes of wt-αB and 3D-αB were about 550 and 390 kDa, respectively (data not shown). Stress proteins are known to have a chaperone activity and there are several reports describing such activity for αB-crystallin (30Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 31Rao P.V. Horwitz J. Zigler Jr., J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of phosphorylation on this parameter, we assessed thermal aggregation of LDH in the presence or absence of recombinant wt-αB or 3D-αB. As shown in Fig.4, A and B, the degree of prevention from thermal aggregation of LDH by 3D-αB was slightly weaker than that of wt-αB and this tendency was more obvious when the ratio of LDH to αB-crystallin was higher. Moreover, we estimated the ability of wt-αB and 3D-αB to refold denatured firefly luciferase. In the absence of αB-crystallin, the activity of luciferase remained to be lowered (Fig. 4 C). In the presence of wt-αB or 3D-αB, refolding of luciferase was clearly observed, but the refolding activity of 3D-αB was weaker than that of wt-αB (Fig. 4 C). To estimate the effects of phosphorylation on the oligomerization state of αB-crystallin in mammalian cells, we performed a transient expression of wt-αB and 3D-αB in COS-m6 cells. Consistent with the results obtained with the purified recombinant proteins, the band for 3D-αB was observed at a slightly different position from wt-αB after the SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunostaining with antibodies against C-terminal peptide of αB-crystallin (Fig. 5 A). Extracts of cells transiently expressing wt-αB or 3D-αB were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation with subsequent fractionation and Western blot analysis. The sedimentation profiles of wt-αB and 3D-αB were quite different (Fig. 5 B). Quantitation of the intensity of each band revealed that wt-αB mainly sedimented at a position corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of about 500 kDa while 3D-αB sedimented at ∼100 kDa. These results were also similar to the case with purified recombinant proteins, as shown in Fig. 3, although both forms of αB-crystallin in transiently-transfected COS-m6 cells fractionated within narrow ranges. We previously reported that various stresses induce phosphorylation of αB-crystallin in U373 MG cells, a combination of PMA and okadaic acid treatment markedly increasing phosphorylated forms (19Ito H. Okamoto K. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We therefore estimated whether phosphorylation of endogenous αB-crystallin causes change in its oligomerization state. Endogenous αB-crystallin in control U373 MG cells formed a large oligomer with an apparent molecular mass of about 500 kDa. After treatment of cells with PMA and okadaic acid, the sedimentation profile of αB-crystallin was clearly shifted to a smaller molecular size (Fig. 6,A and B). Using antibodies specifically recognizing each of the three phosphorylation sites of αB-crystallin, we examined whether phosphorylated forms were present in fractions containing smaller oligomers in U373 MG cells treated with PMA and okadaic acid. The phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin, detected by each of the three specific antibodies, was observed in fractions corresponding to the relatively smaller molecular masses (Fig. 6,C and D). The same fractions used in the experiment for Fig. 6 were also subjected to isoelectric focusing with subsequent Western blot analysis using antibodies against C-terminal peptide of αB-crystallin. It was confirmed that treatment of cells with PMA and okadaic acid at 37 °C for 90 min resulted in the induction of multiple phosphorylated bands which had more acidic isoelectric points, the sedimentation profile of αB-crystallin being shifted to a smaller molecular size as compared with that of untreated control cells (Fig. 7). These results indicate phosphorylation of endogenous αB-crystallin to cause a change in oligomerization state also in cells in vivo. To compare chaperone-like activity of wt-αB or 3D-αB in cells in vivo, we estimated the protective activity of each protein against heat inactivation of luciferase in transiently-transfected CHO cells. When cells reached confluence after transfection, they were subjected to heat treatment at 45 °C for 70 min and then cultured at 37 °C for 16 h. In mock-transfected cells, luciferase activity was almost completely inactivated after heat treatment (Fig. 8). In contrast, luciferase activity in cells expressing wt-αB was not decreased but rather increased after heat treatment (Fig. 8). In cells expressing 3D-αB, luciferase activity was protected as compared with mock-transfected cells but the degree of the protection was significantly less than that of cells expressing wt-αB (Fig. 8). We report here for the first time that phosphorylation of αB-crystallin results in change in its oligomerization state. Oligomerization states of wt-αB and 3D-αB were found to be quite different on analysis by sucrose density gradient centrifugation with subsequent Western blot analysis of both purified recombinant proteins or extracts of cells transiently expressing these proteins (Figs. 3 and5). Moreover, the oligomerization size of αB-crystallin in U373 MG cells, which had been treated with PMA and okadaic acid to induce extensive phosphorylation, became smaller and the majority of phosphorylated forms of αB-crystallin were detected in fractions corresponding to a smaller oligomerization size (Figs. 6 and 7). These results suggest that phosphorylation of αB-crystallin causes a reduction of its oligomerization. We and other groups previously reported that the phosphorylation of HSP27 caused similar dissociation of large oligomers (11Kato K. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11274-11278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). It has also been described that HSP20, another sHSP (33Kato K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is phosphorylated by a cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathway which results in reduction of its oligomer size (34Brophy C.M. Dickinson M. Woodrum D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6324-6329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). From these data, we conclude that αB-crystallin shares a characteristic feature of sHSPs,i.e. phosphorylation-dependent reduction of oligomerization. The changes in HSP27 and HSP20 in response to phosphorylation were more drastic than those with αB-crystallin, but in fact, both oligomerized and dissociated forms of HSP27 and HSP20 are detectable in extracts of normal tissues and cells, while αB-crystallin is only present as an oligomer about 500 kDa under the same conditions (33Kato K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There have been several reports concerning the phosphorylation state and chaperone-like activity of αB-crystallin. Nicoll and Quinlan (22Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) found both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of αB-crystallin to be equally modulating intermediate filament assembly. Wang et al. (35Wang K. Ma W. Spector A. Exp. Eye. Res. 1995; 61: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) further showed both forms of αB-crystallin purified from rat lens exhibited similar chaperone-like activity. While it has also been reported that αB-crystallin prevents cytochalasin-induced depolymerization of actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, in the absence of cytochalasin, its effects on the actin polymerization state are phosphorylation-independent (21Wang K. Spector A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We carried out thermal aggregation assays of LDH and luciferase refolding assays using recombinant proteins and found that 3D-αB showed a less chaperone-like activity as compared with wt-αB (Fig. 4). Most of the phosphorylated forms of αB-crystallin in rat lens are phosphorylated at one or two sites and the amount of αB-crystallin phosphorylated at all three sites is limited (19Ito H. Okamoto K. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore the chaperone-like activity of the phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin purified from lens may not be much different from that of unphosphorylated αB-crystallin and major effects can only be observed by using 3D mutants as models. The relationship between oligomerization state and chaperone-like activity is also not clear. Under our experimental conditions, wt-αB existing as large oligomers exhibited more powerful chaperone-like activity than 3D-αB forming smaller oligomers (Fig. 4). However, it has been reported that mutation of R120G in αB-crystallin causes a larger oligomer than wt-αB which demonstrate less chaperone-like activity (36Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang Q. Ding L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 37Perng M.D. Muchowski P.J. van Den I.P. Wu G.J. Hutcheson A.M. Clark J.I. Quinlan R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33235-33243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the oligomerization state of αB-crystallin may not be determining in this respect. We also examined the ability of αB-crystallin to protect luciferase against heat in CHO cells (Fig. 8). In cells expressing wt-αB, luciferase activity after heat treatment did not decrease but rather increased (Fig. 8). The reason for this result is not clear although it is in line with a previous report (38van de Klundert F. van den IJssel P. Stege G.J.J. de Jong W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As compared with wt-αB, the ability of 3D-αB to protect luciferase activity against heat in CHO cells was significantly reduced (Fig. 8), consistent with the resultsin vitro as shown in Fig. 4. Far UV CD spectra of recombinant wt-αB and 3D-αB, purified fromE. coli, were similar at 25 °C (Fig. 1 B), indicating mutation does not cause significant change of secondary structure and it is in agreement with results for HSP27 (13Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). From the results of near UV CD spectra, intrinsic fluorescence spectra and ANS binding assay, it is suggested that mutation causes significant change of the environment of aromatic amino acid and the extent of hydrophobicity (Figs. 1 D and 2). At a higher temperature, the pattern of far UV CD spectra of both proteins were changed and the change in the pattern of 3D-αB was more prominent than that of wt-αB (Fig. 1 C), indicating that the secondary structure of 3D-αB sensitively changed in response to an increasing temperature. The biological significance of phosphorylation and changes in the oligomerization size of αB-crystallin is still unclear. Since the effects on oligomerization state and chaperone-like activity were less than those found for HSP27, phosphorylation may confer another biological activity on αB-crystallin, with small oligomers perhaps preferentially interacting with other proteins. In our previous study, we detected in vitro phosphorylation of αB-crystallin using an N-terminal 72-amino acid (N72-K) peptide as a substrate because bovine αB2-crystallin was not phosphorylatedin vitro under any conditions which caused phosphorylation of αB-crystallin in vivo (20Kato K. Ito H. Kamei K. Inaguma Y. Iwamoto I. Saga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28346-28354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The N72-K peptide can be obtained by digestion of bovine unphosphorylated αB2-crystallin by lysyl endopeptidase and this peptide contains all three phosphorylation sites of αB-crystallin without the α-crystallin domain, which is thought to play an important role in oligomerization of the molecule (39Boelens W.C. Croes Y. de Ruwe M. de Reu L. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28085-28090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These experiments suggested that the protein kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of αB-crystallin may not be able to access the potential phosphorylation sites in the large oligomer under our experimental conditions in vitro, whereas in vivo cellular machinery which folds proteins in adequate forms might make them accessible. There could be proteins which specifically interact with the phosphorylated form of αB-crystallin. Elucidation of the possibility should help to clarify the functions of αB-crystallin. We thank Dr. Akiko Iwaki and Dr. Hiroshi Itoh for generous gifts of cDNAs for human αB-crystallin and expression vector, pCMV5, respectively."

We previously reported that TLS is a potential splicing regulator able to modulate the 5′-splice site selection in an E1A pre-mRNA. Using an in vitroselection procedure, we investigated whether TLS exhibits a specificity with regard to RNA recognition. The RNAs selected by TLS share a common GGUG motif. Mutation of a G or U residue within this motif abolishes the interaction of TLS with the selected RNAs. We showed that TLS can bind GGUG-containing RNAs with a 250 nm affinity. By UV cross-linking/competition and immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrated that TLS recognizes a GGUG-containing RNA in nuclear extracts. Each one of the RNA binding domains (the three RGG boxes and the RNA recognition motif) contributes to the specificity of the TLS·RNA interaction, whereas only RRM and RGG2–3 participate to the E1A alternative splicing in vivo. The specificity of the TLS·RNA interaction was also observed using as natural pre-mRNA, the G-rich IVSB7 intron of the β-tropomyosin pre-mRNA. Moreover, we determined that RNA binding specificities of TLS and high nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 were different.

The resulting fusion protein contains the N-terminal part of TLS fused to a transcription factor of the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein family of proteins: CHOP. In an acute myeloid leukemia, TLS is also involved in a chromosomal breakpoint that juxtaposes the same N-terminal region of TLS to a transcription factor of the ETS proteins family: ERG-1 (3Ichikawa H. Shimizu K. Hayashi Y. Ohki M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2865-2868PubMed Google Scholar, 4Panagopoulos I. Aman P. Fioretos T. Hoglund M. Johansson B. Mandahl N. Heim S. Behrendtz M. Mitelman F. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1994; 11: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TLS is highly similar toEWS, a gene implicated in chromosomal translocations that are specific of the tumors of the Ewing family (5Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. De Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, 6Zucman J. Melot T. Desmaze C. Ghysdael J. Plougastel B. Peter M.

In most of these sarcoma, the N-terminal region of EWS is fused to the DNA binding domain of either ERG-1 or FLI-1, which are two closely related ETS proteins.Both TLS and EWS have in common a similar structural organization. Their C terminus part contains multiple domains that are involved in RNA·protein interactions: an RNA recognition motif (RRM) flanked by two regions rich in Arg-Gly-Gly repeats (RGG domains) and a C2C2 zinc finger. In their N terminus domain, they contain a glutamine-, serine-, and tyrosine-rich region that functions as a transcriptional activation domain when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain (7May W.A. Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Klemsz M. Lewis B.C. Lunsford L.B. Hromas R. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7393-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 8Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L.

In oncogenic chimera, the adjunction of this N-terminal region of TLS or EWS to the transcriptional regulators CHOP, FLI-1, or ERG-1 generates proteins with transcriptional activities that differ from those of the wild-type counterpart (8Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3717-3729PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bailly R.A. Bosselut R. Zucman J. Cormier F. Delattre O. Roussel M. Thomas G. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). From these data it has been proposed that the oncogenic fusion proteins disturb the expression of genes that are regulated by CHOP, FLI-1, or ERG-1. However, no cellular targets for these oncoproteins have yet been identified. Moreover, the N-terminal region of TLS or EWS in chimeric proteins could have a dominant negative effect on the function of the germ-line TLS and EWS as suggested from the recent identification of oncogenic determinants in the N-terminal domain of TLS (11Ichikawa H. Shimizu K. Katsu R. Ohki M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7639-7650Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The biological activity of TLS is still not clearly understood. Indeed, analysis of TLS-deficient mice suggests a possible role of TLS in both repairing DNA damage (12Kuroda M. Sok J. Webb L. Baechtold H. Urano F. Yin Y. Chung P. de Rooij D.G. Akhmedov A. Ashley T. Ron D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and maintaining genomic integrity (13Hicks G.G. Singh N. Nashabi A. Mai S. Bozek G. Klewes L. Arapovic D. White E.K. Koury M.J. Oltz E.M. Van Kaer L. Ruley H.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). According to these biological data, various biochemical studies identified TLS as a protein involved in pairing DNA sequences during homologous recombination (14Bertrand P. Akhmedov A.T. Delacote F. Durrbach A. Lopez B.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4515-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Baechtold H. Kuroda M. Sok J. Ron D. Lopez B.S. Akhmedov A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34337-34342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Other data argue for a role of TLS in regulation of gene transcription. TLS as EWS and the highly similar factor hTAFII 68 have been purified in distinct TFIID complexes associated with the RNA polymerase II (16Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 17Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In that way, they may function as basal transcriptional regulators participating in the recognition of transcriptional promoter and initiation of gene transcription. Moreover, TLS is able to behave as a DNA binding protein (18Perrotti D. Bonatti S. Trotta R. Martinez R. Skorski T. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Iozzo R.V. Cooper D.R. Calabretta B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4442-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and several cellular partners of TLS that have been identified are transcription factors. These are the nuclear receptors of the thyroid and steroid hormones (19Powers C.A. Mathur M. Raaka B.M. Ron D. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the ETS transcription factor Spi-1/PU.1 (20Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. MoreauGachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).TLS is also presumed to play a role in splicing process. TLS is the high nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) p2 that has been identified in a protein complex assembled on adenovirus pre-mRNA (21Calvio C. Neubauer G. Mann M. Lamond A.I. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 724-733PubMed Google Scholar). TLS is engaged in a complex with the hnRNPs A1 and C1/C2 (9Zinszner H. Albalat R. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and associates with several spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (22Hackl W. Fischer U. Lührmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TLS is complexed to RNA polymerase II transcripts in UV-irradiated HeLa cell extracts (23Zinszner H. Sok J. Immanuel D. Yin Y. Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1741-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are consistent with the location of theDrosophila homologue of TLS (SARFH/CAZ) (24Immanuel D. Zinszner H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4562-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Stolow D.T. Haynes R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) on actively transcribed regions in the polytene chromosomes of salivary glands. In addition, RNA polymerase II inhibitors induce relocation of TLS from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and this TLS shuttling depends on its C-terminal RNA binding domain (9Zinszner H. Albalat R. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) (26Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Thus, TLS has an RNA binding activity, presents an alternative nucleocytoplasmic location, and associates with hnRNP complexes; all of these properties are hallmarks of hnRNPs. Moreover, TLS was found to be associated with the AG dinucleotide during the 3′-splice site recognition step (27Wu S.P. Green M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4421-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and it takes part to the selection of alternative splice sites in an E1A pre-mRNA splicing assay (20Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. MoreauGachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, TLS can recruit, by its C terminus RGG-rich region (28Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 29Yang L. Embree L.J. Hickstein D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3345-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), two splicing regulators of the serine/arginine-rich protein (SR) family. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that TLS might function as a splicing factor.These various functions, describing TLS as a protein participating either in transcription or splicing processes, may involve, at a given time, an interaction of TLS with DNA and/or RNA. Indeed, it has been reported that TLS is capable of binding RNA (8Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3717-3729PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zinszner H. Sok J. Immanuel D. Yin Y. Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1741-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hackl W. Luhrmann R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as well as both single- and double-stranded DNA (18Perrotti D. Bonatti S. Trotta R. Martinez R. Skorski T. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Iozzo R.V. Cooper D.R. Calabretta B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4442-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In particular, TLS targets a zinc finger consensus sequence in DNA and, in so doing, could participate in the transcriptional regulation of some cytokine receptors in myeloid cells (18Perrotti D. Bonatti S. Trotta R. Martinez R. Skorski T. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Iozzo R.V. Cooper D.R. Calabretta B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4442-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Some proteins that contain RRM motifs such as hnRNP A1 (31Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and the SR proteins such as SC35 and ASF/SF2 (32Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) have been shown to target specific mRNA short motifs involved in pre-RNA splicing. However, little is known about the RNA recognition specificity of TLS, and whether the role of TLS in RNA splicing depends on its RNA binding specificity is an opened question. To gain further insight into RNA·TLS interaction, we performed a selection/amplification of RNAs from pools of random sequence RNAs. Here we show that TLS is able to target specifically RNAs containing a GGUG motif both in vitro and in vivo. We also determined that the specificity of RNA recognition depends on the cooperation of the three RNA binding domains of TLS.DISCUSSIONThe present studies were undertaken to determine whether TLS presented a specificity of RNA recognition. We have demonstrated that TLS presents an RNA binding specificity related to its ability to recognize a GGUG motif. Our initial observation that TLS was capable of interacting with homoribopolymers with a preference for poly(G) and poly(U), was already indicative of the RNA binding activity of TLS. Although an interaction of TLS with homoribopolymers has been previously described as restricted to poly(G) recognition (8Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3717-3729PubMed Google Scholar), our data agree with the poly(G) poly(U) binding of the 69-kDa mRNP-associated protein identified later as TLS (30Hackl W. Luhrmann R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). EWS, which harbors an RNA binding domain very similar to the TLS one, presents also a strong binding activity to both poly(U) and poly(G) (38Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. Lerga, M. Hallier, L. Delva, C. Orvain, I. Gallais, J. Marie, and F. Moreau-Gachelin, unpublished data. Thus, TLS and EWS behave similarly toward recognition of both poly(U) and poly(G), suggesting that their common structure could account for their identical RNA binding activity.To further investigate whether TLS binds RNA in a sequence-specific manner, we analyzed the RNAs selected in vitro from a randomized sequence RNAs pool by a purified recombinant TLS. Seventy-two selected RNA sequences were identified and compared. Fifty-seven percent of them contained a GGUG core sequence. This motif was held as the major determinant of TLS·RNA binding specificity, because a point mutation G to C or U to C within this GGUG element is sufficient to abolish binding of TLS to RNA. However, modifications of nucleotides bordering GGUG core reduced also the TLS·RNA interaction. In particular, the change A to C of the 5′-nucleotide to the GGUG motif of ggugRNA and U to C of the 3′-nucleotide to the GGUG motif prevented the TLS binding. These data suggest that nucleotides surrounding the GGUG motif modulate TLS interaction with RNA either directly or by contributing to a suitable structural conformation of the RNA. TLS contains three domains potentially implicated in RNA binding. The RRM is a 90-amino acid residue domain involved in sequence-specific RNA recognition by many RRM-containing proteins. Most frequently the RRM is present as multiple copies that contribute together to the RNA binding specificity of the protein as described for the hnRNP A1 (39Xu R.M. Jokhan L. Cheng X.D. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Structure. 1997; 5: 559-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), theDrosophila sex-lethal protein (40Handa N. Nureki O. Kurimoto K. Kim I. Sakamoto H. Shimura Y. Muto Y. Yokoyama S. Nature. 1999; 398: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), U2AF, ASF/SF2 (41Chandler S.D. Mayeda A. Yeakley J.M. Krainer A.R. Fu X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3596-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and nucleolin (42Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). TLS contains also two RGG-rich regions, a domain known to harbor an RNA binding activity (43Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). When we investigated the behavior of these domains regarding the ggugRNA recognition, we observed that each one was able to bind RNA. In particular, the RNA binding activity of RRM was not foreseeable, because it did not interact with any of the homoribopolymers. The differences in the nature and the secondary structures of RNAs could account for the apparent discrepancy between the behavior of RRM with regard to its interaction with either a ribonucleotidic sequence RNA or homoribopolymers. It has to be pointed out that RRMs and RGGs seem to have similar abilities to discriminate ggugRNA from its mutated forms as does the entire TLS molecule.The mechanism involved in RNA recognition by TLS is still unknown. Secondary structure of the RNA is an important component of the RNA·protein interaction. A search for a secondary structure in selected RNA molecules did not make possible a prediction of a common structural conformation for the selected sequences. 3D. Bouthinon, personal communication. In addition, the selected motifs have neither a bipartite structure as identified in the RNA binding consensus motif for hnRNP A1 (31Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) nor an inverted repeat or intramolecular base pairing that would form a stem-loop secondary structure as reported for nucleolin (42Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).The selected sequences are bound by TLS with affinities ranging from 250 to 600 nm, the highest apparent Kdbeing 250 nm for the ggugRNA·TLS complex. Thus, TLS seems to be a protein showing a moderate affinity for its RNA ligand. Indeed, an overview of the dissociation constants that characterize the interaction of some RNA binding proteins with their respective ligands gives a Kd value from 1 nm, for the interaction of hnRNP A1 with its RNA binding site identified by SELEX (31Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), to 600 nm, for the interaction of branchpoint bridging protein, with the branchpoint sequence (44Berglund J.A. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We cannot rule out that the Kd of the complex TLS·ggugRNA determined in vitro is distantly related to theKd of a complex RNA·protein in a splicing context. However, a weak affinity of a splicing factor for its target RNA sequence may be one compatible condition with a successful spliceosome assembly that proceeds through exchange and replacement of multiple abundant proteins on a pre-mRNA substrate.Our previous studies suggested that TLS played a similar role to hnRNP A1 in modulating the 5′-splicing site selection during transient splicing assay of the E1A minigene (20Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. MoreauGachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our present data show that hnRNP A1 and TLS differ in their RNA binding specificity. TLS is not able to bind the hnRNP A1 target RNA identified by SELEX (31Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and reciprocally, hnRNP A1 is not able to bind the TLS-selected RNA in EMSA. In addition, hnRNP A1 targets its RNA binding site with a much greater affinity (Kd of 1 nm) than TLS does. Thus, it seems unlikely that these two proteins perform competitive function in pre-mRNA splicing.From the RNA competition experiments in nuclear extracts we conclude that the binding of TLS to RNA is specific for RNA containing the GGUG core. The fact that TLS recognizes RNA ligands in a sequence-dependent manner strongly argues for a role of RNA·TLS interaction in vivo. We have previously shown that TLS interferes with the selection of alternative 5′-splice sites during processing of the E1A pre-mRNA in vivo (20Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. MoreauGachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our present data indicate that RRM and RGG2–3 are involved in the modulation of this splicing model, although with a reduced efficiency as compared with the effect of wild-type TLS. In contrast to their similar behaviors with regard to specific RNA recognition, RGG1, RRM, and RGG2–3 act in different ways in regulation of alternative splicing. Strikingly, the RGG2–3, which displays most of the splicing activity, has been shown to recruit members of the serine-arginine family of splicing factors such as SC35 and TASR (28Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The authors report that association of these SR proteins to TLS alters the influence of TLS on E1A pre-mRNA splicing. SR proteins function both in constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing, and RNA binding sites have been identified for several of them (45Tacke R. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the RGG2–3 region in TLS appears involved at the same time, in specific RNA recognition, in alternative splice site selection, and in recruiting splicing factors. Whether the activity of TLS in splicing is linked to its ability to identify intronic or exonic RNA elements remains to be determined.The nature and the function of the RNA sequences targeted by TLS is also an opened question. Sequences as short as GGAAG (46Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (A/U)GGG (37Sirand-Pugnet P. Durosay P. Brody E. Marie J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3501-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), or G triplets (47McCullough A.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4562-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) can act, respectively, either as exonic or intronic splicing enhancers to improve splice site selectivity. The biological relevance of the GGUG consensus motif in a splicing process remains to be determined. The GGUG motif did not make possible a search for a statistically significant matching in the data bases that would be informative regarding the location of the selected RNA sequences within pre-mRNAs or the nature of the RNAs bound by TLS in vivo. It was intriguing to observe the repeated presence of the GGUG motif in the RNA sequences selected by the U2AF35splicing factor which recognizes the 3′-splice site AG dinucleotide (48Wu S. Romfo C.M. Nilsen T.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Such an interaction of TLS with the 3′-splice site has already been suggested when it was identified as the factor cross-linked to the AG dinucleotide at the 3′-splice site of an adenovirus major late pre-mRNA substrate (27Wu S.P. Green M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4421-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, no selection with regard to the presence of an A upstream of the GGUG motif could be deduced from the TLS-selected RNA sequences excluding that a potential 3′-splice site was directly recognized by TLS. Nevertheless, we tested the consequences of the addition of an excess of the ggugRNA in an in vitro splicing assay using a β-globin minigene model to determine whether this RNA could impede pre-mRNA maturation. We could not observe any modifications of the pre-mRNA splicing that would suggest a capacity of the ggugRNA sequence to titrate some splicing factors involved in splice site selection (data not shown). However, it seems obvious from the cross-linking experiment without immunoprecipitation that many other proteins besides TLS bind ggugRNA in nuclear extracts and subsequently are able to titrate the ggugRNA. They may explain the inability of the ggugRNA to compete for recognition of the splice sites by splicing factors.Hence, TLS appears as an RNA binding protein that recognizes a GGUG motif. It remains unclear whether the role of TLS in splicing is determined by its ability to target specific RNA elements within pre-mRNA or small nuclear RNAs. Other investigations will be required to identify both the role of TLS and the possible function of such a GGUG motif in splicing of a pre-mRNA. TLS (Translocated inLipoSarcoma)1 orFUS has been first characterized as a rearranged gene in chromosomal translocations specific of human myxoid liposarcoma (1Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 2Rabbitts T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion protein contains the N-terminal part of TLS fused to a transcription factor of the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein family of proteins: CHOP. In an acute myeloid leukemia, TLS is also involved in a chromosomal breakpoint that juxtaposes the same N-terminal region of TLS to a transcription factor of the ETS proteins family: ERG-1 (3Ichikawa H. Shimizu K. Hayashi Y. Ohki M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2865-2868PubMed Google Scholar, 4Panagopoulos I. Aman P. Fioretos T. Hoglund M. Johansson B. Mandahl N. Heim S. Behrendtz M. Mitelman F. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1994; 11: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TLS is highly similar toEWS, a gene implicated in chromosomal translocations that are specific of the tumors of the Ewing family (5Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. De Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, 6Zucman J. Melot T. Desmaze C. Ghysdael J. Plougastel B. Peter M.

In most of these sarcoma, the N-terminal region of EWS is fused to the DNA binding domain of either ERG-1 or FLI-1, which are two closely related ETS proteins. Both TLS and EWS have in common a similar structural organization. Their C terminus part contains multiple domains that are involved in RNA·protein interactions: an RNA recognition motif (RRM) flanked by two regions rich in Arg-Gly-Gly repeats (RGG domains) and a C2C2 zinc finger. In their N terminus domain, they contain a glutamine-, serine-, and tyrosine-rich region that functions as a transcriptional activation domain when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain (7May W.A. Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Klemsz M. Lewis B.C. Lunsford L.B. Hromas R. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7393-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 8Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L.

In oncogenic chimera, the adjunction of this N-terminal region of TLS or EWS to the transcriptional regulators CHOP, FLI-1, or ERG-1 generates proteins with transcriptional activities that differ from those of the wild-type counterpart (8Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3717-3729PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bailly R.A. Bosselut R. Zucman J. Cormier F. Delattre O. Roussel M. Thomas G. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). From these data it has been proposed that the oncogenic fusion proteins disturb the expression of genes that are regulated by CHOP, FLI-1, or ERG-1. However, no cellular targets for these oncoproteins have yet been identified. Moreover, the N-terminal region of TLS or EWS in chimeric proteins could have a dominant negative effect on the function of the germ-line TLS and EWS as suggested from the recent identification of oncogenic determinants in the N-terminal domain of TLS (11Ichikawa H. Shimizu K. Katsu R. Ohki M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7639-7650Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The biological activity of TLS is still not clearly understood. Indeed, analysis of TLS-deficient mice suggests a possible role of TLS in both repairing DNA damage (12Kuroda M. Sok J. Webb L. Baech"

https://openalex.org/W2110358014,"Previous work has shown that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase moiety provides protection to normal human keratinocytes against apoptosis. This protection is, at least in part, due to EGFR-dependent expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-xL. Here we focused on intracellular signaling pathways relevant to keratinocyte survival and/or Bcl-xL expression. By using pharmacological inhibitors and dominant negative expression constructs, we observed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and phospholipase Cγ/protein kinase Cα activation were required for keratinocyte survival independently of EGFR activation or Bcl-xL expression. By contrast, MEK activity required EGFR activation and, as shown by use of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and a dominant negative MEK construct, was necessary for Bcl-xL expression and survival. Consistent with an earlier study, blocking SRC kinase activities similarly led to down-regulation of Bcl-xL protein expression and impaired keratinocyte survival. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that EGFR-dependent MEK activity contributes to both Bcl-xL expression and survival of normal keratinocytes. Other signaling pathways (i.e. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and phospholipase Cγ/protein kinase Cα) are obligatory to keratinocyte survival but not to Bcl-xL expression, and control of these pathways by EGFR activation is not rate-limiting to normal keratinocyte survival.

Appropriate signals are transmitted in cell type-specific fashion by growth factor/cytokine, cell-matrix adhesion, or cell-cell adhesion receptors. Removal of essential survival signals triggers physiological cell death by default. Recent studies have implicated many cell surface receptors previously known to affect cell cycle progression and proliferation also in cellular survival. For example, normal human keratinocytes require activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 by exogenous or endogenous signals to survive (1Rodeck U. Jost M. Kari C. Shih D.-T. Lavker R.M. Ewert D.L. Jensen P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 113-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rodeck U. Jost M. DuHadaway J. Kari C. Jensen P.J. Risse B. Ewert D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dermatol. 1999; 112: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Specifically, EGFR blockade using a ligand-antagonistic monoclonal antibody results in enhanced susceptibility to cell death provoked by cellular stressors such as passaging (1Rodeck U. Jost M. Kari C. Shih D.-T. Lavker R.M. Ewert D.L. Jensen P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 113-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or UVB irradiation. 2M. Jost, F. P. Gasparro, and U. Rodeck, unpublished observations. Several lines of evidence highlight a prominent role of Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, in EGFR-dependent keratinocyte survival. First, activation of the EGFR on keratinocytes by exogenous or endogenous ligands is associated with up-regulation of Bcl-xL expression (2Rodeck U. Jost M. DuHadaway J. Kari C. Jensen P.J. Risse B. Ewert D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5067-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Second, induction of cell death by EGFR blockade is a slow process requiring at least several days of EGFR blockade and is preceded by down-regulation of Bcl-xL (1Rodeck U. Jost M. Kari C. Shih D.-T. Lavker R.M. Ewert D.L. Jensen P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 113-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, forced expression of Bcl-xL in immortalized keratinocytes rescues these cells from cell death associated with EGFR blockade (4Jost M. Class R. Kari C. Jensen P.J. Rodeck U. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). EGFR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be required for protection against cell death because EGFR-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the tyrphostin class cause Bcl-xL down-regulation and cell death in a manner similar to the EGFR-antagonistic monoclonal antibody (2Rodeck U. Jost M. DuHadaway J. Kari C. Jensen P.J. Risse B. Ewert D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5067-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Taken together, these earlier results implicate signal transduction pathways activated by EGFR-dependent phosphorylation events in keratinocyte survival. The multiplicity of cell surface receptors activated by exogenous signals is contrasted by the relative uniformity of intracellular signaling pathways triggered by these receptors. For example, EGFR activation leads to activation of parallel signal transduction pathways including SRC, RAS, phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, and phospholipase (PLC) γ in different cell types (reviewed in Ref. 5Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The same signaling components are also affected by engagement of various other growth factor receptors and of adhesion receptors of the integrin family. Thus, integration of multiple signals from diverse growth factor and adhesion receptors must take place at a membrane-proximal location to generate parallel second messengers. By implication, signal strength for individual signaling pathways may be provided either by activation of multiple receptors by diverse ligands or by strong signaling by a single class of receptors. The former scenario is likely to apply to normal cells, whereas the latter may operate in malignant cells, which have become independent of certain extracellular signals for survival. In view of this interpretation, it is important to define the relative contribution of each single class of cell surface receptors to signal transduction events required for cellular survival. In this study, we attempted to distinguish signaling pathways obligatory to keratinocyte survival, which depend on EGFR activation from those that are required independently of EGFR activation. By using a combination of small molecular weight inhibitors and dominant negative expression constructs, we probed the contribution of several signaling cascades including the SRC, PI 3-kinase/AKT, PLCγ/PKC, STAT, and MEK/MAPK pathways to keratinocyte survival and Bcl-xL expression. The effects of abrogating the function of specific signal transducers were related to the effects of EGFR blockade on keratinocyte survival and to Bcl-xL expression. We describe that PI3-kinase/AKT, PLCγ, and PKCα activities were essential to keratinocyte survival. However, these pathways did not depend on the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity to support keratinocyte survival and did not affect Bcl-xL expression. By contrast, MEK activity was dependent on EGFR activation and was required for sustained Bcl-xL expression and keratinocyte survival. Properties of the EGFR antagonistic mAb 425 have been described earlier (6Murthy U. Basu A. Rodeck U. Herlyn M. Ross A.H. Das M. Arch. Biochem.

HA tag antibodies were from Covance (Richmond, CA). Normal foreskin keratinocytes and HaCaT cells were maintained in culture as described earlier (10McNeill H. Jensen P.J.

Inhibitors were diluted from Me2SO stocks directly into the culture medium. The Me2SO concentration was adjusted to 0.5% in all conditions including controls. After 48 h cells were harvested for analysis as described below. A plasmid containing dominant negative MEK1 cDNA (pMCL-MKK1-8E (11Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S.

In STAT3F, the C-terminal tyrosine (Tyr-705) has been changed to phenylalanine, which prevents phosphorylation of this mutant. The replacement of two glutamic acids (Glu-34 and Glu-35) in the DNA binding domain of the STAT3D mutant renders this protein unable to bind DNA.

A dominant negative AKT-encoding plasmid was obtained from Dr. Thomas F. Franke (pCMV-HA-AKT(K179M)) (13Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). By replacing a lysine (Lys-179) with methionine in the kinase domain, it has been rendered inactive. HA-AKT(K179M) was subcloned into pCEPTetP. Transfections were performed using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of ∼3 × 103/cm2 in complete MCDB medium and allowed to attach overnight. Transfections were performed 1 day after seeding using 0.5 μg of DNA and 1.7–2.0 μl of Fugene 6 per 105cells following the manufacturer's protocol. Selection was started 48–72 h after transfection using 0.2 mg/ml G419 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 2 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). Transient transfections using a 1.1-kilobase pair Bcl-xL promoter fragment cloned into pGL3 (Promega) driving expression of luciferase were performed as described (14Jost M. Kari C. Rodeck U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3131-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed using reagents from PharMingen (San Diego, CA) and Tropix Inc. (Bedford, MA) as described earlier (14Jost M. Kari C. Rodeck U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3131-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses, attached cells were washed once in cold PBS and then lysed in 1× nonreducing Laemmli buffer followed by boiling for 3–5 min. Protein content was determined using the BCA method (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were treated with blocking buffer (5% dry milk in PBS or 5% dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) in TBS). Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS or in TBS containing 5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with membranes for 12 h at 4 °C followed by incubation (1 h at room temperature) in dilutions of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in the same buffers. Following antibody incubations membranes were washed in 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS or TBS. Signals were visualized by chemiluminescence using reagents from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. After detection, blots were washed and inactivated by staining with SG substrate (Vector Labs) and used for further antibody incubations. AKT and MAPK assays were performed using nonradioactive kits manufactured by New England Biolabs. Briefly, cells were treated for 48 h and lysed in 1× lysis buffer. Equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated with either an immobilized phospho-MAPK antibody that only cross-reacts with the phosphorylated,i.e. active, form of MAPK or with an immobilized AKT antibody that recognizes both active and inactive AKT. The immobilized precipitated enzymes were then used for kinase assays using either ELK-1 (for MAPK) or GSK-3β (for AKT) followed by Western blot analysis with antibodies that allow detection and quantitation of phosphorylated substrates. To detect DNA nicks and breaks as markers of apoptotic cell death, TUNEL assays were performed. Briefly, floating and attached cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. Prior to staining with Biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), cells were washed in PBS containing 1% BSA. Staining was performed using TdT enzyme and buffers purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals for 1 h at 37 °C. After the TUNEL reaction cells were stained with 2.5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate/Avidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in 4× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 sodium citrate), 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk followed by a wash with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were analyzed without delay using a FACScan cytometer (Coulter, Fullerton, CA). To identify signal transduction pathways relevant to EGFR-dependent Bcl-xL expression or survival of human keratinocytes, we first determined the effects of EGFR blockade by EGFR-antagonistic mAb 425 on several pathways previously shown to be affected by EGFR engagement in different cell types. These included PI 3-kinase/AKT (15Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed using immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) in a serum-free medium containing insulin as the sole exogenous growth factor to account for EGFR-dependent signaling events induced by autocrine EGFR ligands, several of which are known to be produced by cultured keratinocytes (22Cook P.W. Mattox P.A. Keeble W.W. Pittelkow M.R. Plowman G.D. Shoyab M. Adelman J.P. Shipley G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 23Cook P.W. Pittelkow M.R.

Physiol. 1995; 163: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, these experiments were performed using steady-state conditions by maintaining cells for 24–48 h under the same media conditions. In select experiments EGF was added short term (5–10 min) to the medium to provide a strong receptor activation signal. As shown in Fig. 1 A, EGFR blockade by mAb 425 used at 66 nm markedly reduced steady-state phosphorylation of the MAPK substrate ELK-1 in normal human keratinocytes. By contrast, EGFR blockade using mAb 425 had little effect on GSK-3 β phosphorylation (Fig.1 B); GSK-3 β is a major target of the serine/threonine kinase AKT (26Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). As controls we used the MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 to inhibit ELK-1 phosphorylation and the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 to inhibit GSK-3β phosphorylation. STAT3 was expressed prominently in HaCaT keratinocytes but was not phosphorylated under steady-state conditions (not shown). Similarly, short term stimulation of HaCaT cells (Fig. 1 C) or normal primary keratinocytes (not shown) with EGF (10 ng/ml) failed to detectably induce STAT3 phosphorylation although it was associated with robust induction of MAPK phosphorylation that was inhibitable by the EGFR-selective tyrphostin AG1478. This was in contrast to A431 squamous carcinoma cells that contained comparatively high levels of constitutively phosphorylated STAT3 and in which STAT3 phosphorylation was further stimulated by exogenous EGF. Inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase moiety by use of AG1478 abrogated the effect of EGF on STAT3 and MAPK phosphorylation in A431 cells but did not affect base-line STAT3 phosphorylation in these cells. Previously, STAT3 phosphorylation was observed in primary mouse keratinocytes after placing them into forced suspension culture (27Hauser P.J. Agrawal D. Hackney J. Pledger W.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 847-855PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these earlier findings we also observed STAT3 phosphorylation in primary keratinocytes placed in suspension culture (not shown). This result demonstrates that STAT3 phosphorylation was inducible in human keratinocytes albeit not through activation of the EGFR. Similar to STAT3, we did not observe PLCγ phosphorylation in normal and immortalized keratinocytes in the presence or absence of EGF (not shown), although short term EGF treatment induced readily detectable PLCγ phosphorylation in A431 cells. In summary, these results indicated that EGFR activation in primary and HaCaT keratinocytes contributed substantially to MEK/MAPK but not to AKT or STAT3 activation. We next examined the effects of small molecular weight compounds commonly used to inhibit signaling through PI 3-kinase/AKT, PLCγ/PKC, and the RAS/RAF/MEK cascade on keratinocyte survival (Table I). We used LY294002 to inhibit PI 3-kinase activity, PD98059 to inhibit MEK-dependent phosphorylation events, the amino steroidU73122 to inhibit PLC-dependent signaling, and Rottlerin and Gö6976 to inhibit PKCδ and PKCα activities, respectively (Table I). In addition, we determined by use of the SRC inhibitors PP1 or PP2 whether SRC family members were required for keratinocyte survival. The inhibitors were used at concentrations needed to inhibit functional activity of the respective signaling pathways. In these assays, the fraction of apoptotic keratinocytes after 24–48-h treatments was determined by TUNEL staining combined with FACS analysis. This assay is highly quantitative as it measures the frequency of cells with DNA nicks within at least 2 × 104 cells/sample. We have reported previously (1Rodeck U. Jost M. Kari C. Shih D.-T. Lavker R.M. Ewert D.L. Jensen P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 113-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rodeck U. Jost M. DuHadaway J. Kari C. Jensen P.J. Risse B. Ewert D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5067-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that EGFR inhibition by mAb 425 does not induce cell death within the first 24–48 h of treatment but rather sensitizes these cells to cellular stress. To provide a direct comparison between the effects attributable to EGFR blockade and the effects of inhibitors of signal transduction pathways, mAb 425 was included in all assays. As expected, treatment with mAb 425 did not affect survival of either normal keratinocytes or HaCaT cells under steady-state conditions in the absence of cellular stress. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of MEK or PKCδ activity had only marginable effects on cell survival in this setting. By contrast, inhibition of PI 3-kinase, SRC, PLCγ, and PKCα activities induced significant increases in the fraction of TUNEL-positive cells within 48 h of treatment. The PLCγ inhibitor U73122 and the PKCα inhibitor Gö6976 induced cell death most effectively as judged by the fraction of TUNEL-positive cells after 48 h. Both inhibitors also caused significant cell death as early as 12 h after addition (not shown). These results are consistent with the view that activation of PI 3-kinase, SRC, and PLCγ/PKCα is obligatory to keratinocyte survival but that EGFR activation is not essential to maintain levels of activation of these signaling components required for survival of this cell type.Table IEffects of pharmacological inhibitors of signal transduction pathways on spontaneous apoptosis of normal human keratinocytes (NHK) and immortalized HaCaT keratinocytesTargetInhibitor (concentration)TUNEL positive cellsNHKHaCaT%Control76EGFRmAb 425 (66 nm)83MEKPD98059 (50 μm)75PKCδRottlerin (3 μm)812PI 3-kinaseLY294002 (20 μm)1312SRCPP1 (20 μm)1717PLC-γU73122 (10 μm)23NDPKC-αGö6976 (5 μm)3130Primary human keratinocytes (NHK) and immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes were seeded in MCDB medium supplemented with insulin (5 μg/ml) and inhibitors at the concentrations indicated.

Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by FACS-TUNEL after 48 h; ND, not determined. Our previous studies demonstrated that EGFR blockade is associated with down-regulation of Bcl-xL mRNA and protein expression prior to manifestation of cell death and that Bcl-xL overexpression obviates the enhanced apoptosis susceptibility observed in keratinocytes treated with EGFR inhibitors (2Rodeck U. Jost M. DuHadaway J. Kari C. Jensen P.J. Risse B. Ewert D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5067-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Jost M. Class R. Kari C. Jensen P.J. Rodeck U. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the effects of signal transduction inhibitors on Bcl-xL protein expression as determined by Western blot analysis. These experiments were done after 48 h of incubation with the respective compound. As shown in Fig.2 and consistent with a very recent report (28Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), inhibition of either SRC or SRC-like kinases by PP1 was associated with down-regulated Bcl-xL protein expression in HaCaT cells. Similarly, treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 was associated with consistently lower steady-state Bcl-xLprotein levels. By contrast, inhibition of PI 3-kinase, PLCγ, or PKCα had no detectable effect on Bcl-xL expression. To obtain independent evidence for the requirement of PI 3-kinase/AKT signaling for keratinocyte survival, we generated HaCaT cells, which conditionally expressed a dominant negative AKT construct under tetracycline control. This construct encodes an AKT derivative rendered kinase-inactive by point mutation within the AKT catalytic domain (13Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar); upon overexpression in HaCaT cells it was functional as demonstrated by its ability to down-regulate GSK-3β phosphorylation (Fig.3 A). Similar to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, overexpressed inactive AKT induced spontaneous keratinocyte apoptosis over a 48-h period (Fig.3 C) but had no effect on Bcl-xL expression (Fig.3 B) during this time. To target the MEK/MAPK pathway specifically, we used a dominant interfering MEK construct that has no kinase activity (11Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Upon transfection into HaCaT cells, we first confirmed conditional expression of the MKK1-8E construct (Fig.4 A). When overexpressed, MKK1-8E induced spontaneous apoptosis in HaCaT cells (Fig.4 B) consistent with an important role of MEK-dependent signaling in maintaining keratinocyte survival. Furthermore, overexpression of MKK1-8E was accompanied by moderately but consistently down-regulated Bcl-xLexpression in HaCaT keratinocytes (Fig. 4 A); in different experiments Bcl-xL expression levels were reduced by 30–50% in MKK-8E overexpressing HaCaT keratinocytes when compared with uninduced or mock-transfected HaCaT cells. This result was consistent with the observation that the MEK inhibitor PD98059 reduced Bcl-xL expression in HaCaT cells (see above). Next, we assessed the effect of transiently transfected MKK1-8E onBcl-x promoter activity. To this end, we used a 1.1-kilobase pair Bcl-x promoter fragment driving expression of the luciferase gene in HaCaT keratinocytes (Fig.5). We observed consistent down-regulation of promoter activity (40–60%) in cells cotransfected with MKK1-8E when compared with cells that were transfected with a mock construct or with HA-AKT(K179M).Figure 5Effects of dominant negative MEK onBcl-x promoter activity. HaCaT cells were transiently cotransfected with MKK1-8E and a Bcl-x-luc reporter construct schematically shown at the bottom of the figure.

They are found in the plasma membranes of bacteria, thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, and in the inner membrane of mitochondria. They use a proton gradient across their host membrane to produce ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (1Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg.

This enzyme contains two distinct parts, called Fo and F1. The Fo mediates the transmembrane transport of protons, and the synthesis of ATP takes place on the F1.The F1 contains five different types of subunits in the stoichiometric ratio α3β3γδε (3Penefsky H.S.

Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). The oligomerization of the F1monomers is assisted by two proteins called Atp12p and Atp11p. These interact directly with the α-F1 and β-F1proteins, respectively (15Wang Z.-G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Wang Z.-G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast strains lacking either Atp11p or Atp12p, the α-F1 and β-F1 proteins aggregate in the mitochondrial matrix (17Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus it is believed that Atp12p and Atp11p facilitate the formation of αβ heterodimers by protecting these two F1 subunits from non-productive interactions (16Wang Z.-G. Sheluho D. Gatti D.L. Ackerman S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We report in this study the identification of Fmc1p, a novel protein required for the formation or stability of the F1 oligomer. Like Atp11p and Atp12p, its absence also results in the aggregation of the α-F1 and β-F1 proteins. However, this is seen only at elevated temperatures (37 °C), whereas Atp11p and Atp12p are required both in normal (28–30 C°) and heat stress conditions. Interestingly, the formation/stability of the F1 oligomer was restored in cells lacking Fmc1p by increasing the expression of Atp12p. We propose that Fmc1p assists the folding/stability or functioning of Atp12p and that this role becomes essential at elevated temperatures.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and MediaThe S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table I.Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used for the cloning and propagation of plasmids.

Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The 297- and 470-base pair DNA sequences located, respectively, upstream of the ATG initiator codon and downstream of the stop codon ofFMC1 were PCR1-amplified from yeast genomic DNA (W303–1B) with the primers P1 (5′-GTATGCTTGATACGTTTGGACAG), P2 (5′-CAATCTATACGTGTCATTCTGAACGATTCCCTGGCACTCTCTCTTTCTCTCTC), P3 (5′-GAGTGTACTAGAGGAGGCCAAGAGCCGACATAGTATCTAATCAATTTATAATATC), and P4 (5′-CATTTGGGAAATGACGAAGGCTATTTG). DNA fragments carryingHIS3 were generated by PCR from plasmid pUC18-HIS3 (19Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) with the primers Pa (5′-TCGTTCAGAATGACACGTATAGAATG) and Pb (5′-CTCTTGGCCTCCTCTAGTACACTC). The three PCR products (P1-P2, P3-P4, and Pa-Pb) were mixed, and PCR with the primers P1 and P4 gave a DNA fragment in which HIS3 was flanked by sequences adjacent to the FMC1-coding region. The strain W303–1B was transformed with the deletion cassette, and resulting His+clones were analyzed by Southern blot. Out of 12 His+transformants analyzed, 11 gave the expected hybridization signals (not shown).Plasmid ConstructionsCloning of FMC1A DNA fragment carrying FMC1 was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of W303–1B with the primers 5′-ATTCCTCGTCAGATAATCACC and 5′-GGGCAACGTAAAAACCTCGATAG. The PCR product was cut by RsaI to produce a blunt end fragment containing the FMC1 coding sequence with 579 base pairs upstream of the initiator ATG and 498 base pairs downstream from the Stop codon. This fragment was cloned at the HincII site of pUC19 to give pJR22. From this plasmid, theHindIII-BamHI fragment containing FMC1was cloned into the centromeric plasmid pRS316 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cut with the same pair of enzymes to give pLL1.Cloning of ATP12 in a Low Copy Number VectorTheATP12-containing HindIII-HindIII fragment of pLE10 was inserted at the HindIII site of pRS316 to give pLL5.Isolation of ATP12 as a Multicopy Suppressor of the Null Allele Δfmc1The Δfmc1 strain MC6 was transformed with a partialHindIII digest of yeast chromosomal DNA cloned into theURA3-containing multicopy vector pEMBLYe23 (a gift of Dominique Thomas, Gif-sur-Yvette). About 100,000 Ura+transformants were selected on SC medium lacking uracil and were then replica-plated onto glycerol medium (N3) prewarmed for at least 2 h at 37 °C. After an incubation of 5 days at 37 °C, clones that showed good growth were retested for their growth on glycerol at 37 °C after curing the plasmids they contained on SC medium supplemented with 0.1‥ of 5-fluoroorotic acid. When growth on glycerol at 37 °C was plasmid-dependent, the suppressor plasmids were recovered in E. coli and tested again by retransformation of Δfmc1 cells. Several rescuing plasmids contained the same insert, a HindIII-HindIII 1599-base pair fragment corresponding to a segment of chromosome X between coordinates 87249 and 88848 (this plasmid has been called pLE10). Since ATP12 was the only gene present on this fragment, it can be concluded that it was responsible for the suppressor activity of pLE10.Genetic and Molecular Biology MethodsGenetic experiments were carried out as described by Roseet al.

Three lines of evidence show that this phenotype is due to the inactivation of FMC1 as follows. (i) The correct integration of the deletion cassette at theFMC1 locus was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (not shown); (ii) the mutant phenotype and histidine prototrophy cosegregated 2:2 in tetrads originating from heterozygous Δfmc1/+ cells (not shown); and (iii) after transformation with a plasmid containing FMC1 (pLL1), Δfmc1cells recovered a normal growth on ethanol or glycerol at 37 °C. As oxidative phosphorylation is essential for growing yeast on glycerol or ethanol, these data indicated that FMC1 may be needed for the formation or functioning of the yeast energy transducing system at elevated temperatures.We first aimed to determine whether FMC1 is needed for pre-mRNA splicing or the propagation of mtDNA at elevated temperatures. To this end, we constructed a Δfmc1 strain containing an intronless mtDNA (strain MC6, see TableI). This strain was still unable to grow on glycerol or ethanol at 37 °C (Fig. 1), showing that the absence of respiratory growth is not due to a defect in mitochondrial pre-mRNA splicing.The propagation of the mtDNA by the mutant was analyzed by determining the production of cytoplasmicpetites 2A petite designates a mutant yeast cell that fails to grow on a non-fermentable carbon source (glycerol or ethanol). On a 2‥ glycerolmedium containing low amounts of glucose (0.1‥), such cells can makeonly small size colonies and are therefore called petites. (rho −/rho° cells) during fermentation at elevated temperatures. Fresh cells were grown at 28 °C in glycerol (selecting for a rho +mitochondrial genome), then grown for 5–6 generations in glucose at 28 or 37 °C. The cultures were then plated at 28 °C on a glycerol medium containing 0.1‥ glucose (on this medium cells that fail to produce ATP by oxidative phosphorylation give very small colonies). This analysis was performed for wild type and Δfmc1strains, with either a wild type (intron-containing) or intronless mitochondrial genome. The results presented in TableII show that deletion of FMC1gene leads to a 5–7-fold increase in petite production in the presence of both an intron-containing and intronless mitochondrial genome at 37 °C. However, it is clear that the level ofpetite production seen at 37 °C, especially in the presence of an intronless mitochondrial genome, is not sufficient to explain the respiratory-deficient phenotype. We conclude that the increased production of petites is probably a secondary effect of the Δfmc1 mutation.Table IIProduction of petite (rho−/rhoo) cells by the Δfmc1 mutantStrain28 °C37 °CPetitesGrandes‥PetitesPetitesGrandes‥PetitesWild type [13 introns]18340553313(MC3)232329Δfmc1 [13 introns]72043844068(MC8)44601825361Wild type [w/o intron]2355<1124313(MC1)1480<11211<1Δfmc1 [w/o intron]1245<11410511(MC6)0230<12314614The strains were cultivated for five to six generations in glucose (YPGA) at the indicated temperature (28 or 37 °C). The cultures were then diluted and spread for single colonies on a glycerol medium containing 0.1‥ glucose. The petite(rho o/rho −) andgrande (rho +) colonies were scored after 4 days of incubation at 28 °C. Open table in a new tab When the Δfmc1 strain was grown for a longer time on glucose at 37 °C (up to 15 generations), higher levels ofpetites were not observed. This suggests that the Δfmc1 petites grow poorly at 37 °C, preventing them from completely taking over the cultures. To test this, Δfmc1 cells were made rho° by growing them in the presence of ethidium bromide at 28 °C and then transformed with a plasmid bearing FMC1 or with the corresponding empty vector. The resulting transformants were then tested for their growth on glucose at 37 °C. At 37 °C growth of the Δfmc1 rho°, cells transformed with the empty vector was severely affected compared with that of the Δfmc1 rho° cells transformed with the cloned FMC1 gene (Fig.2). Consistent with this, we found thatrho + Δfmc1 cells grew poorly at 37 °C in the presence of ethidium bromide (not shown). Thus whenS. cerevisiae lacks FMC1, it needs a wild type mtDNA to grow normally by fermentation at elevated temperatures.Figure 2In the absence of mtDNA , the Δfmc1 mutant grows poorly by fermentation at elevated temperatures. The Δfmc1 mutant was maderho° by growing at 28 °C in the presence of ethidium bromide and was then transformed with a plasmid containing theFMC1 gene (pLL1) or the corresponding empty vector (pRS316). The transformants were grown for 2 days at 28 °C in a glucose medium lacking uracil (SC-ura). The cultures were diluted, and 5 μl of each dilution were spotted on SC-ura. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C and then photographed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we analyzed the expression of the mtDNA in the Δfmc1mutant with an intronless mtDNA (to reduce problems associated withpetite production). In a Northern blot analysis, probes specific for the genes CoxI, CoxII, ATP9, ATP6, and 21 S RNA produced similar radioactive signals in the mutant and wild type, indicating that FMC1 is not involved in transcription of the mitochondrial genes at elevated temperatures (Fig.3 A). We then determined the ability of Δfmc1 cells to synthesize the mitochondrially encoded proteins at 37 °C. This was done with whole cells grown by fermentation for five to six generations at 37 °C. These were incubated at 37 °C for varying times (5, 15, or 30 min) with radiolabeled Met + Cys in the presence of cycloheximide (an inhibitor of cytoplasmic protein synthesis that has no effect on the mitochondrial ribosomes). Mitochondrial membranes were then prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. This revealed that the mutant grown at 37 °C was able to normally synthesize six of the eight proteins encoded by the mtDNA (cytochrome b, Cox1, Cox2, Cox3, Var1, and ATP6), whereas the radioactive signals corresponding to ATP9 and ATP8 were significantly weaker in comparison to the wild type (even when the time of incorporation of the radiolabeled amino acids was reduced to 5 min) (Fig. 3 B). In the experimental conditions used, it is difficult to determine whether the rate of synthesis of ATP9 and ATP8 was reduced in the mutant and/or whether they were less efficiently incorporated into mitochondrial membranes or more prone to proteolytic degradation (see below).Figure 3Analysis of the expression of mitochondrially encoded genes in the Δfmc1 mutant at elevated temperatures. Panel A, Northern blot analysis of mitochondrial transcripts. Total mitochondrial RNAs were isolated from wild type FMC1 + (strain MC1) and mutant Δfmc1 (strain MC6) grown for 6–8 generations in galactose (YPGALA) at 37 °C. The RNAs were separated in a formaldehyde-containing agarose gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The same blot was hybridized successively with32P-radiolabeled DNA probes specific for cytochromeb (Cyt b), CoxI, CoxIII, ATP6, and 21 S rRNA genes. Panel B, mitochondrial protein synthesis. Wild type FMC1 + (strain MC1) and mutant Δfmc1 (strain MC6) cells were grown in galactose (YPGALA) for 6–8 generations at 37 °C and then incubated as indicated for 5′ or 15′ at 37 °C with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine in the presence of cycloheximide. Mitochondrial membranes were then isolated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and an autoradiograph of the gel (500,000 cpm were loaded on eachlane).

For this, we used a Δfmc1 strain containing an intronless mtDNA. Mitochondria isolated from the mutant and wild type strains grown at 28 °C exhibited the same oxygen consumption rates (see TableIII). By contrast, when the mutant was grown at 37 °C, its respiratory activity was substantially reduced (by 70‥) in comparison to the wild type strain cultivated at the same temperature.Table IIIRespiratory and ATPase activitiesStrainTemperatureRespiration ratesATP hydrolytic ratesNADH + CCCPAscorbate + TMPD + CCCP−DCCD+DCCD(nmol O · min−1 · mg−1)nmol Pi · min−1 · mg−1Wild type rho +(MC1)37 °C59220317502 ± 3903613 ± 103Δfmc1 rho +(MC6)37 °C1914011051 ± 112947 ± 102Wild type rho o37 °C002133 ± 1852170 ± 234Wild type rho +(MC1)28 °C87720506547 ± 1242274 ± 105Δfmc1 rho +(MC6)28 °C100627446582 ± 8021426 ± 50Mitochondria were isolated from wild type rho +(strain MC1), mutant Δfmc1 rho + (strain MC6), and wild type rho o [derived from strain W303-1B) grown for six to eight generations in galactose (YPGALA) at the indicated temperature (28 or 37 °C). Respiration rates are the average of two different experiments. The ATPase activities are the average of three different experiments presented with the S.D. For the cells grown at 28 °C, the zymolyasae treatment for the preparation of mitochondria was made at 28 °C. For those grown at 37 °C, the zymolyasae treatment was performed at 37 °C. All the ATP hydrolytic assays were performed at 37 °C. CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone; TMPD,N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. Open table in a new tab Mitochondria from the mutant and wild type strains cultivated at 28 °C had approximately the same DCCD-sensitive ATP hydrolytic activity (Table III). By contrast, Δfmc1 cells grown at 37 °C had a very low mitochondrial ATPase activity (less than 10‥ of the control). This residual activity was essentially insensitive to DCCD and also about two times lower than that of mitochondria isolated from wild type rho° cells cultivated at 37 °C. Thus, the F1 sector of the ATP synthase is severely affected in yeast cells lacking FMC1 grown at 37 °C, whereas it is fully active when these cells are grown at 28 °C.It should be noted that the ATPase activity measured for the wild type grown at 37 °C was much less sensitive to DCCD than that of wild type cells grown at 28 °C (see Table III). This suggests that a substantial part of the F1 sector is not physically or functionally coupled with the Fo sector when wild type yeast is cultivated at elevated temperatures. This observation has been reported previously (42Paul M.F Disruption et Mutagénèse du Gène ATP4, Codant pour une Sous-Unité du Secteur fo de l'ATP Synthase Mitochondriale de Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The Fig.4 shows the results obtained with mitochondria isolated from mutant and wild type cells grown at 37 °C. For the wild type, the addition of ethanol produced a fluorescence quenching of the dye, which was transiently decreased by adding 50 μm ADP, thus reflecting an electrogenic exchange of internal ATP against external ADP and a proton influx th"

The M. thermophila γ-CA exists as a trimer, with the active site located at the interface between two subunits. Each subunit is organized around a left-handed β-helix that is completely distinct from the α-CA fold, although the active site is also coordinated by three histidines, along with two water molecules (17Kisker C. Schindelin H. Alber B.E. Ferry J.G. Rees D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2323-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 18Iverson T.M. Alber B.E. Kisker C. Ferry J.G. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9222-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The β class includes CAs from plants, algae, bacteria, and archaea (2Smith K.S. Jakubzick C. Whittam T.S. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15184-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 3Hewett-Emmett D. Tashian R.E. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1996; 5: 50-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In higher plants, β-CAs play an important role in photosynthesis, by concentrating CO2 in the proximity of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase for CO2fixation (19Badger M.R. Price G.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 369-392Crossref Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The purification and characterization of carbonic anhydrase (Cab) from the thermophilic Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum extends this class into the archaea (20Smith K.S. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6247-6253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cab is at the phylogenetic extreme of the β class carbonic anhydrases and forms an exclusively prokaryotic clade consisting primarily of sequences from Gram-positive bacteria (2Smith K.S. Jakubzick C. Whittam T.S. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15184-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In the obligate chemolithoautotroph M. thermoautotrophicum, Cab converts CO2 to HCO3−, suggesting that the physiological role of this enzyme may be to provide HCO3− to enzymes important in CO2 fixation pathways of the microbe (21Smith K.S. Cosper N.J. Stalhandske C. Scott R.A. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6605-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Ferry J. BioFactors. 1997; 6: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). β class carbonic anhydrases can be further divided into “plant”- and “cab”-type, based on the active site sequence conservation (20Smith K.S. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6247-6253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Kimber M.S. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Two crystal structures of plant-type β-CA were recently reported from Porphyridium purpureum(P. purpureum β-CA) (24Mitsuhashi S. Mizushima T. Yamashita E. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Moriyama H. Ueki T. Miyachi S. Tsukihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5521-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and Pisum sativum (P. sativum β-CA) (23Kimber M.S. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basic fold of β-CA consists of a four-stranded, parallel β-sheet core with α-helices forming right-handed cross-over connections (23Kimber M.S. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mitsuhashi S. Mizushima T. Yamashita E. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Moriyama H. Ueki T. Miyachi S. Tsukihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5521-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The oligomerization state of β-CA is variable, however, and P. purpureum β-CA and P. sativum β-CA exist as a dimer and octamer, respectively, although the dimer of P. purpureum β-CA resembles a tetramer, where two monomers are fused together. In contrast to the protein ligation by three histidines observed in α- and γ-CAs, the active site zinc in β-CAs is coordinated by two cysteines and one histidine, as anticipated from extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy studies (21Smith K.S. Cosper N.J. Stalhandske C. Scott R.A. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6605-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Bracey M.H. Christiansen J. Tovar P. Cramer S.P. Bartlett S.G.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13967-13976Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The fourth ligand is different in the two β-CAs structures. In the P. sativum β-CA structure, an acetate molecule is bound to the zinc, whereas in the P. purpureumβ-CA structure, the side chain of aspartic acid (Asp151) acts as the fourth ligand. In the P. sativum β-CA structure, this conserved Asp interacts with a conserved Arg (Fig.1). Apart from the conserved zinc ligands and the Asp/Arg pair, the active site of Cab differs significantly from the plant-type β-CAs. Cab active site residues His23, Met33, Lys53, Ala58, and Val72 are replaced in the plant-type β-CA by Gln, Ala, Phe, Val, and Tyr, respectively. Residues that are equivalent to Cab residues Met33, Lys53, Ala58, and Val72 make up the hydrophobic pocket in the P. sativum and P. purpureum β-CA structures. Substitutions of the two aromatic side chains by Lys and Val in Cab suggest a significant redesign of the hydrophobic pocket in cab-type β-carbonic anhydrase. Cab has a CO2 hydration activity with a kcat of 1.7 × 104s−1 and Km for CO2 of 2.9 mm at pH 8.5 and 25 °C (20Smith K.S. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6247-6253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cab is inhibited by iodide, nitrate, and azide; however, in contrast to plant-type β-CAs, chloride and sulfate have no effect on Cab activity. These active site substitutions, together with the different effects of inhibitors, imply that there might be mechanistically relevant differences in the organization of the active sites between cab-type and plant-type enzymes. Here we present the first structure of the cab-type β-carbonic anhydrase from thermophilic methanoarchaeonM. thermoautotrophicum, determined at 2.1-Å resolution. Cab was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by a heat denaturation step followed by ion exchange chromatography as previously described (20Smith K.S. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6247-6253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystals were grown by the hanging drop method at 22 °C using a 5 mg/ml protein solution and a precipitant solution containing 100 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 35% ethanol, 12% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 50 mm calcium acetate. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 54.9 Å, b = 113.2 Å,c = 156.2 Å and three dimers per asymmetric unit. Crystals were transferred stepwise to mother liquor solution containing 30% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as a cryoprotectant and flash frozen. A three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected at −160 °C on beamline 9-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Research Laboratory with an ADSC charge-coupled device detector. The fluorescence spectrum measured around the zinc edge of a single crystal was used to select the inflection point (λ = 1.2832 Å), the absorption edge (λ = 1.282 Å), and a high energy remote wavelength (λ = 1.033 Å) for optimization of the anomalous signal. All data were reduced using DENZO and scaled using SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The structure was determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion using the signal from only the intrinsic zinc atoms. The program SOLVE (28Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Cryst. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar) was used to find the positions of the heavy atoms using the three wavelength multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set using data from 20- to 2.4-Å resolution. Two zinc ions were identified and when used for phasing yielded a figure of merit of 0.44. Four additional zinc sites were located in an anomalous difference Fourier map, yielding a figure of merit of 0.54. Each of the six zinc sites corresponded to a Cab monomer, which are organized into three tight dimers in the asymmetric unit. The initial noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) transformations were established by the relationships between the dimers, and the initial mask was calculated with the program NCSMSK (29Bailey S. Acta Cryst. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The program DM (30Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) was used for NCS averaging of the electron density maps, solvent flattening, and phase extension from 2.4- to 2.1-Å resolution. The resulting map was of good quality and allowed building of most of the protein. Alternate cycles of manual model building using the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and positional and individual B-factor refinement with the program CNS (32Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Manual Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) reduced the R andRfree to 21.1 and 24.6% respectively, whereRfree is calculated for 5% (2875) of the reflections in the resolution range 18–2.1 Å. The model was initially refined with strict NCS restraints, which were released later in the refinement. The r.m.s. deviation of bond lengths and angles are 0.013 Å and 1.7° respectively, with 87.9% in the most allowed region and 11.1% in the additionally allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The average B-factors are 28.6 Å2 (main chain), 32.4 Å2 (side chains), 18.6 Å2 (zinc atoms), and 36.3 Å2 (solvent). An average B-factor of 30.5 Å2 is calculated for all protein atoms. The final model contains 7543 protein atoms, 3 Hepes molecules, 6 zinc atoms, 6 calcium atoms, and 409 water molecules, for a total of 8015 atoms (Table II).Table IIRefinement statisticsParameterValueSpace groupP212121Cell dimensionsa (Å)54.67b(Å)113.21c (Å)156.18Resolution (Å)20–2.1Rcryst(%)2-aRcryst = Σ‖Fo −Fc‖/Σ‖Fo‖.21.1Rfree(%)2-bRfree =Rcryst calculated for 5% of reflections omitted from the refinement.24.6r.m.s. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.014Bond angles (degrees)1.70Torsion angles (degrees)22.9Improper torsion angles (degrees)1.392-a Rcryst = Σ‖Fo −Fc‖/Σ‖Fo‖.2-b Rfree =Rcryst calculated for 5% of reflections omitted from the refinement. Open table in a new tab The overall fold of the Cab monomer (Fig. 2A) consists of a four-stranded parallel β-sheet core with strand order 2-1-3-4. Monomers in each dimer are related by a 2-fold axis centered between strands β2. The overall dimensions of the dimer are ∼40 × 45 × 50 Å (Fig. 2B). Three dimers, designated AB, CD, and EF, are present in the asymmetric unit. In the structurally conserved β-sheet region (residues 26–32, 52–57, 80–88, 149–157, and 163–167), the r.m.s. deviations in Cα positions between the dimers average 0.24 Å. Using Cα positions for residues 24–170, the corresponding r.m.s. deviations are 0.34 Å between dimers AB and CD, 1.0 Å between dimers AB and EF, and 1.1 Å between dimers CD and EF. The relatively large r.m.s. deviations for the latter two pairs of dimers reflect the poor ordering for residues 91–126 in monomer E. Excluding these residues, the r.m.s. deviations drop to ∼0.28 Å. The r.m.s. deviation in the β-sheet region between the A and B, C and D, and E and F subunits of the Cab are ∼0.6 Å, while the r.m.s. deviation for all Cα between the subunits are ∼0.8 Å. The regions with the largest conformational variation include the N-terminal residues 1–23 (involved in crystal packing), residues 92–95, and residues 120–125. While the N-terminal residues 1–23 are well defined in monomers A, C, and E, residues 13–23 are disordered in monomers B, D, and F. Residues 92–95 and 120–125 form a hinge region for helices α4 and α5 and are well ordered in monomers B and D, slightly disordered in monomers A, C, and F, and disordered in monomer E. The variability in region 90–125 between the six crystallographically independent monomers suggests that these residues are conformationally mobile. Overall, with the exception of the noted regions, the three dimers in the asymmetric unit are very similar. Unless stated otherwise, only dimer AB will be used in future discussions. Six calcium ions were located on the surface of Cab and at the crystal packing interfaces between Cab dimers. Most likely, these calcium ions do not play any structural or catalytical role and are a result of the crystallization conditions that contained 50 mm calcium acetate. β-CAs have been found in different oligomeric states ranging from dimers (Oryza sativa, P. purpureum) to tetramers (E. coli) to octamers (P. sativum) (20Smith K.S. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6247-6253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kimber M.S. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mitsuhashi S. Mizushima T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3731-3734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although analytical ultracentrifugation results suggest that Cab exists as a homotetramer (21Smith K.S. Cosper N.J. Stalhandske C. Scott R.A. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6605-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Cab appears to form a dimer in the crystal. There are numerous interactions stabilizing the dimer involving residues in β-strand β2 and helices α2, α3, α4, and α5. Hydrogen bonds between residues 56 and 57 from strand β2 in both subunits result in a formation of a 10-stranded β sheet. Helices α4 and α5 extend out and make extensive contacts with the other monomer in the dimer (Fig. 2B). The interface area between these two subunits was found to be ∼2110 Å2/subunit, which is ∼21% of the total (∼10,000 Å2) monomer accessible surface area as calculated with GRASP (34Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar). Residues A2–A23 pack against a symmetry-related molecule burying 860 Å2, resulting in the formation of a continuous ribbon through the crystal (Fig. 3). Residues B2–B12 most likely fold back and pack against the B monomer in the same way that A2–A12 packs against the symmetry-related molecule. Residues B13–B23 have no visible electron density and are disordered. A similar type of crystal packing forming a continuous ribbon has been observed in the sterile α motif domain of the human EphB2 receptor and, together with other evidence, was proposed to be functionally important (35Thanos C.D. Goodwill K.E. Bowie J.U. Science. 1999; 283: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The crystal packing interaction seen in Cab can also be described as a linear (open-ended) domain swapped oligomer, where the swapped domain consists of a 12-residue α-helix (36Bennett M.J. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 37Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether residues 1–24 could facilitate the formation of a higher oligomerization state under physiological conditions or whether residues A2–A23 also fold back and pack against monomer A. Based on modeling considerations, although the N-terminal region is highly flexible, formation of a Cab tetramer similar to the one seen in the P. purpureumstructure is unlikely in the absence of conformational changes due to steric clashes of helices α4 and α5. Other contacts between Cab dimers in the crystal are relatively small (≤540 Å2) and, based on their complementarity and size (38Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 39Janin J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 973-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), are also unlikely to support formation of stable tetramers. The fold of Cab is similar to that of the P. sativum and P. purpureum β-CAs (Fig.4). While the β-sheet core is conserved, significant secondary structure differences are evident, mostly in the regions at the N terminus, at the C terminus, and in the region containing residues 90–125. The N termini of the P. sativum and P. purpureum β-CA structures extend out, forming a long helix that packs against a second monomer, making additional dimer interactions. In Cab, the N terminus is involved in crystal packing and does not adopt the same conformation observed in the P. sativum and P. purpureum β-CA structures. Cab is one of the smallest β-CAs known and lacks an extended C terminus. In the P. sativum β-CA structure, the C terminus forms a long β-strand that mediates octamerization. In Cab, residues 90–125 form two helices (α4, α5) that project out to cover the second monomer (Fig. 2B) and fold back to start helix α6. In both the P. sativum and P. purpureum β-CA structures, this segment is longer, forms three helices instead of two, and folds back earlier to create two additional turns of helix α6. In the central β-sheet region, the r.m.s. deviations in Cα positions between Cab and P. sativum andP. purpureum structures are 0.62 and 0.56 Å, respectively. The active site cleft is located at the C terminus of the parallel β-sheet and is largely sequestered from solvent. Each Cab subunit contains one zinc atom that resides at the interface of the two monomers (Fig. 2B), although the coordination residues (Cys32, Cys90, and His87) originate from the same monomer. One water molecule completes the tetrahedral coordination sphere of the zinc. Although the crystallization conditions contained 50 mm calcium acetate, no acetate was found in the active site, unlike in the P. sativum β-CA structure (Fig.5A). The average coordination distances from the six active sites are as follows: Cys32Sγ-Zn (2.42 ± 0.03 Å), His87 Nε-Zn (2.11 ± 0.04 Å), Cys90 Sγ-Zn (2.40 ± 0.04 Å), and H2O-Zn (2.15 ± 0.06 Å). The four zinc ligands form a number of hydrogen bonds with the surrounding residues. His87 hydrogen-bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of residue Thr88; Cys32 Sγ hydrogen-bonds with the amide nitrogens of residues Lys22, Asp34, and Gly59; Cys90 hydrogen-bonds with the amide nitrogen of residue Met92; and the coordinating water molecule makes a hydrogen bond to Asp34. Arg36forms the conserved Asp/Arg pair with Asp34 and also interacts with Asp89 and a water molecule. Rather unexpectedly, the two active sites A and B in the Cab dimer exhibit significant differences, which are reflected in the r.m.s. deviations between monomers in a dimer (∼0.65 Å) being consistently larger than between the equivalent monomers in different dimers such as A and C, or B and D (0.24 Å). The active sites in monomers A, C, and E have a Hepes buffer molecule bound near the active site. The sulfate group of the Hepes is located ∼8 Å from the zinc atom, and the sulfate oxygens hydrogen bond with Lys53 Nζ, Ser35 Oγ, and the amide nitrogen of Ser35 (Fig. 5B). The equivalent to Ser35 is present in both plant-type β-CAs and in Cab, while Lys53 is unique to the cab-type β-CAs. Asp34, which makes a hydrogen bond to the zinc-coordinating water molecule, is also within hydrogen bonding distance (∼3.0 Å) to the Hepes sulfate group. Another difference between the two active sites is the conformation of residues 13–24. In the active site of subunit A, residues B13–B24 are disordered and have no visible electron density. In the active site of subunit B, however, residues A13–A24 are well defined and extend out to participate in crystal packing. Superposition of residues in the active sites of subunits A and B (Fig. 5B) indicates that the Hepes molecule would sterically clash with residues Arg16 and Asp17if residues 13–24 adopted the same conformation as in active site B. The zinc-coordinating residues (Cys32, His87, and Cys90) of Cab and P. sativum β-CA superimpose closely (Fig. 6A). The water molecule serving as the fourth zinc ligand in Cab adopts a position similar to the O1 of the acetate ligand in the P. sativumβ-CA structure. The conserved residue Asp34 is held in place by forming two hydrogen bonds to Arg36, as do the corresponding residues Asp162 and Arg164 in theP. sativum β-CA. The following five active site substitutions distinguish the cab-type and plant-type β-carbonic anhydrases: H23Q, M33A, K53F, A58V, and V72Y. The superposition of Cab and P. sativum β-CA structures clearly shows the distinctions in active site organization by these residues. His23, found on a flexible loop, is ∼25 Å away from the catalytic zinc and probably is not a part of the active site. On the other hand, the equivalent residue Gln151 in the P. sativum β-CA structure occupies a position similar to the Hepes sulfate group that is ∼8 Å away from the zinc atom and is possibly involved in ligand binding (23Kimber M.S. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobic pocket of Cab is quite different from that of plant-type β-CA (Fig. 6A). InP. sativum β-CA structure, the hydrophobic pocket is formed by Phe179, Val184, and Tyr205. The corresponding residues in Cab (Lys53, Ala58, and Val72) constitute a more open and less hydrophobic pocket. Again, the protein ligands to the zinc in the two structures superpose closely (Fig. 6B). The fourth ligand is different, since the side chain of Asp151 in the P. purpureum β-CA structure coordinates the zinc instead of the water molecule seen in Cab structure. Asp151 of P. purpureum β-CA is equivalent to Asp34 of Cab. As a consequence of the zinc coordination by Asp151 in the P. purpureumβ-CA structure, this residue cannot pair with the conserved Arg, and Arg153 has flipped away from the active site. The adjacent Ser152 has moved by ∼4 Å and adopts a different conformation in the P. purpureum β-CA structure (Fig.6B). The hydrophobic pocket arrangement of P. purpureum β-CA is very similar to that of P. sativumβ-CA, and the differences between the cab-type and plant-type hydrophobic pocket have already been discussed. The catalytic mechanism of carbonic anhydrases has been most extensively studied for the α-CA class (5Coleman J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6Sly W.S. Hu P.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 40Coleman J.E. J. Biol.

The zinc hydroxide mechanism established for this class provides an appropriate framework for discussing the catalytic mechanism of Cab. In the first part of the CO2 hydration reaction, CO2 binds in the hydrophobic pocket and probably interacts with the amide nitrogen of Thr199. This threonine is known as the “gatekeeper,” and the side chain plays an important role in the α-CAs, together with Glu106, in orienting the CO2 molecule for attack by the zinc-bound hydroxide. In theP. sativum β-CA structure, Asp162, Gly224, and Gln151 are thought to play the same role in orienting CO2 for this attack (23Kimber M.S. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Cab, Asp34 and Gly91 are in the same orientation as Asp162 and Gly224 in P. sativumβ-CA structure and might also help to orient CO2. His23, the equivalent of P. sativum β-CA Gln151, is, however, disordered in active sites A, C, and E, and in active sites B, D, and F it is at the beginning of a segment of residues that pack against the symmetry-related molecule and lies 25 Å away from the active site zinc. The second, rate-limiting, step in the CO2 hydration reaction involves the regeneration of a hydroxide ion from the zinc-bound water molecule. In α-CAII, the zinc ion is located in a deep funnel and requires a proton shuttle to transfer the proton to the bulk solvent. His64 of α-CAII adopts multiple conformations, which facilitates accepting the proton from the zinc-bound water molecule and delivering it to buffer in bulk solution (43Tu C.K. Silverman D.N. Forsman C. Jonsson B.H. Lindskog S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7913-7918Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In γ-CA, Glu84 exhibits multiple conformations and has been proposed to participate in a proton shuttle (18Iverson T.M. Alber B.E. Kisker C. Ferry J.G. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9222-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 44Tripp B. Ferry J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9232-9240Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Residues with multiple conformations have not been described in the active site of any β-CA structure determined so far. Since the β-CA active site is closer to the surface of the protein than the α-CA active site, a protein-mediated proton shuttle might not be necessary. The β-CA reaction rate depends on buffer concentration, implying that proton transfer can be rate-limiting under certain conditions (21Smith K.S. Cosper N.J. Stalhandske C. Scott R.A. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6605-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the Cab structure, a Hepes buffer molecule was found near the active sites A, C, and E. The Hepes sulfate group is located ∼8 Å away from the zinc atom and lies within hydrogen bonding distance of Asp34, which makes a hydrogen bond to the zinc bound water molecule. In theP. purpureum β-CA structure, the equivalent of Asp34 acts as the fourth zinc ligand, and in the proposed mechanism it plays a role in the proton transfer (24Mitsuhashi S. Mizushima T. Yamashita E. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Moriyama H. Ueki T. Miyachi S. Tsukihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5521-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, the most plausible pathway for proton transfer in Cab is from the zinc-bound water molecule to Asp34 and then to the sulfate group of the bound Hepes molecule or a solvent molecule. The conformation of residues 1–25 in active sites B, D, and F is incompatible with Hepes binding, and residues 13–25 must adopt different conformations for Hepes to bind (Fig. 5B). The mobility of residues 1–25 and 92–125 might allow buffer molecules to diffuse into the active site and serve as the proton acceptor necessary to regenerate the zinc-bound hydroxide.

Krammer P.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Apoptosis, however, proceeds only after an ensuing commitment step, which allows effector caspase activation. Recently, Peter and co-workers (2Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar) provided evidence that the quality and quantity of the activated caspase 8 signal are regulated in a cell type-specific fashion and suggested that Fas initiates apoptosis via two different mechanisms. In type I cells, apoptosis occurs after high caspase 8 activation, which signals exclusively via a hierarchical caspase cascade, independent of mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast, apoptosis in type II cells proceeds after minimal caspase 8 activation through an amplification cascade involving mitochondrial dysfunction, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and activation of Apaf-1 and caspase 9. Although many of the upstream elements in type II apoptosis are unknown, this event is inhibited by Bcl-2 and can be mimicked by exogenous addition of short chain ceramides. In both mechanisms, apoptosis eventually ensues after effector caspases, such as 3 and 7, are activated. There are numerous reports of early ceramide elevation upon Fas activation (3Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar, 4Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Ceramide is a second messenger in an evolutionarily conserved stress response pathway that, in different cells, signals events as diverse as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (3Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Ceramide is generated from sphingomyelin by the action of a neutral or acid sphingomyelinase (NSMase1 or ASMase) or byde novo synthesis coordinated through the enzyme ceramide synthase (5Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In response to Fas ligation, ceramide elevation is often biphasic, a rapid elevation with return to baseline is followed by a more prolonged elevation that is progressive. Evidence has been provided that both ASMase and NSMase might contribute to Fas-mediated ceramide elevation (6Cifone M.G. De Maria R. Roncaioli P. Rippo M.R. Azuma M. Lanier L.L. Santoni A. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 7Lin T. Genestier L. Pinkoski M.J. Castro A. Nicholas S. Mogil R. Paris F. Fuks Z. Schuchman E.H. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8657-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), with ASMase involvement in the acute event. Recent investigations titrated down the amount of FADD or procaspase 8 transfected into HeLa and 293T cells to the point where they no longer induced apoptosis (8Grullich C. Sullards M.C. Fuks Z. Merrill Jr., A.H. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8650-8656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, FADD and procaspase 8 nonetheless induced maximal ceramide generation, which was inhibitable by the initiator caspase inhibitor CrmA. These experiments provided evidence that ceramide generation is initiator caspase-dependent and occurs prior to commitment to the effector phase of the apoptotic process. Whether the ceramide generated in response to Fas ligation is involved in the apoptotic process or is an epiphenomenon is a matter of ongoing debate. Testi and co-workers (9De Maria R. Rippo M.R. Schuchman E.H. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) claimed that Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) patients, which have an inherited deficiency of ASMase activity, displayed deficits in ceramide generation and apoptosis, whereas Borst and co-workers (10Cock J.G.

Recently, Green and co-workers (7Lin T. Genestier L. Pinkoski M.J. Castro A. Nicholas S. Mogil R. Paris F. Fuks Z. Schuchman E.H. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8657-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) reported partial resistance to Jo2 anti-Fas-induced liver failure and death inasmase −/− mice in vivo. Furthermore, the establishment of primary cultures of several cell types derived from asmase −/− mice showed that hepatocytes (11Kirschnek S. Paris F. Weller M. Grassme H. Ferlinz K. Riehle A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27316-27323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not thymocytes (7Lin T. Genestier L. Pinkoski M.J. Castro A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8657-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) displayed resistance to Fas-mediated death. Although these genetic models tended to support a possible cell type-specific role for ASMase, and indirectly for ceramide, in Fas-induced apoptosis, other interpretations are possible. For instance, the NPD lymphoblasts described above were transformed with Epstein-Barr virus and the transformation process itself, as well as known Epstein-Barr virus strain-specific phenotypic differences (12Miller C.L. Lee J.H. Kieff E. Longnecker R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 13Miller C.L. Burkhardt A.L. Lee J.H. Stealey B. Longnecker R. Bolen J.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9489-9495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), might have affected the outcome. Further, it remains possible that the resistance of cells from asmase −/− mice to Fas-induced apoptotic death might result from subtle alterations in membrane structure/function independent of ceramide itself. To address directly the issue of the involvement of ceramide in Fas-mediated death, we examined the ability of primary cultures of hepatocytes derived from asmase +/+ andasmase −/− mice to undergo apoptosis in response to anti-Fas antibody. Like embryonic fibroblasts and thymocytes from asmase −/− mice (15Lozano J. Morales A. Cremesti A. Fuks Z. Tilly J.L. Schuchman E. Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), asmase −/− hepatocytes displayed normal sphingomyelin content and were indistinguishable fromasmase +/+ hepatocytes by numerous morphological, biochemical, and biologic criteria. In contrast to wild type hepatocytes, however, ASMase-deficient hepatocytes failed to generate ceramide upon activation of Fas and were markedly resistant to Fas-mediated apoptotic death. Further, the addition of low nanomolar quantities of natural C16-ceramide, which by itself does not effect apoptosis, restored Fas-mediated apoptosis inasmase −/− hepatocytes. Overcoming apoptosis resistance by provision of natural ceramide is evidence that it is the lack of ceramide and not ASMase that determines the Fas sensitivity. The ability of natural ceramide to rescue the phenotype without reversing the genotype provides evidence that ceramide is obligate for efficient Fas induction of apoptosis in hepatocytes. ASMase knockout mice, maintained in a sv129 × C57BL/6 background, are propagated using heterozygous breeding pairs and genotyped as described (16Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Experimental mice were 8–12 weeks old and sacrificed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Harvested livers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C, cut into small pieces, and separated into small clumps with a spatula. Individual hepatocytes were dispersed mechanically by passage through an 18-gauge needle, filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer, washed once with RPMI 1640 complete medium, and resuspended into the same medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, as described (11Kirschnek S.

Viability was always greater than 95% as defined by trypan blue exclusion analysis. After 1 h, cells (5 × 106/ml) were placed in 24-well plates pretreated with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin fraction V (Sigma) in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were treated with anti-Fas Jo2 antibody (Pharmingen) or staurosporine (Sigma) for the indicated times while under constant agitation using a nutator (Becton Dickinson). Hepatocytes were isolated by cannulation of the portal vein and retrograde in situ collagenase perfusion according the method described previously by Picardo et al. (17Picardo A. Fong Y. Karpoff H.M. Yeh S. Blumgart L.H. Brennan M.F. J. Surg. Res. 1996; 63: 452-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were perfused under sterile conditions at 40 °C consecutively with Leffert's buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 30 mm KCl, 1.3 m NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mmd-glucose) with 0.5 mm EGTA for 4 min, without EGTA for 2 min, and then with 33% (w/v) collagenase type V (Roche) and 5 mm CaCl2 for 12 min using an Easy Load perfusion pump (Masterflex, Cole Parmer; flow rate of 16 ml/min). The liver was then minced in cold Leffert's buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2, and isolated hepatocytes were filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer. Isolated hepatocytes were washed twice at 50 × g and resuspended into RPMI 1640 complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Viability was always greater than 95% using this method. Cells (5 × 106/ml) were pretreated for 10 min with C16-ceramide, sphingosine, sphingomyelin, sphinganine, sphingosine 1-phosphate (Biomol), or C16 -dihydroceramide (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.) in dodecane:ethanol (2:98, v/v; 0.05% final concentration) or diluent alone prior to the addition of Jo2 antibody. A single cell suspension of hepatocytes was washed twice and resuspended into 100 μl of H/S (132 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4) containing 2% fetal calf serum and 0.2% NaN3 supplemented with 1 μg/ml anti-Fas Jo2 antibody or an isotype-specific control immunoglobulin. After 45 min on ice, cells were washed with the same buffer and stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-hamster antibody (Pharmingen 12084D). Cell surface Fas was determined in labeled cells by flow cytometry, as described (11Kirschnek S. Paris F. Weller M. Grassme H. Ferlinz K. Riehle A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27316-27323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes, stimulated for the indicated times with Jo2, were lysed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm each sodium pyrophosphate and sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, 125 mm NaCl. Lipids were extracted, and ceramide was quantified by the diacylglycerol kinase reaction as described previously (18Bose R. Chen P. Loconti A. Grullich C. Abrams J.M. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28852-28859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were trypsinized after treatment with anti-Fas antibody or staurosporine and then permeabilized with a solution of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate at 4 °C for 5 min. Apoptosis was assessed by terminal nucleotidyl transferase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). At least 200 cells were counted for each point. Cells were stained with 4 μg/ml each ethidium bromide and acridine orange for 10 min and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy as described (19Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Immunology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 3.17.2-3.17.4Google Scholar). The fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC was used to measure caspase 3-like activity according to the manufacturer's instructions (Kamiya, Seattle, WA). Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test and t test for correlation coefficient. We reported recently that 8–10 week oldasmase −/− mice derived from our colony display normal sphingomyelin content in multiple tissues (15Lozano J. Morales A. Cremesti A. Fuks Z. Tilly J.L.

Consequently, these animals are physiologically normal and do not manifest NPD, as NPD requires sphingomyelin accumulation (21Brady R.O. Arch.

Livers from 8-week-old ASMase-deficient mice displayed normal architecture, and isolated hepatocytes manifested physiologic morphology. No measurable ASMase activity was detected in theasmase −/− hepatocytes (TableI); NSMase activity was unchanged. Further, asmase −/− hepatocytes manifested normal sphingomyelin and ceramide content (Table I), consistent with the observation that these animals develop normally into adulthood (15Lozano J.

Moreover, the activation patterns of p38, c-Jun terminal, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases in response epidermal growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, heat shock, and hyperosmolarity were also similar in asmase +/+ andasmase −/− hepatocytes (Table I).

To investigate whether ASMase-deficient cells displayed defects in Fas-mediated signaling through the sphingomyelin pathway, we treated primary cultures of asmase +/+ andasmase −/− hepatocytes with increasing concentrations of Jo2 anti-Fas antibody. Hepatocytes were treated in suspension, as Kass and co-workers (25Jones R.A. Johnson V.L. Buck N.R. Dobrota M. Hinton R.H. Chow S.C. Kass G.E. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1632-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that plating hepatocytes as monolayers conferred Fas resistance, i.e. the development of a requirement for cycloheximide for death induction (25Jones R.A. Johnson V.L. Buck N.R. Dobrota M. Hinton R.H. Chow S.C. Kass G.E. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1632-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, hepatocytes in suspension retained sensitivity to Fas-mediated death. Fig. 2 Ashows that asmase +/+ hepatocytes displayed dose-dependent elevation in ceramide content when measured at 5 min of treatment. As little as 50 ng/ml Jo2 increased ceramide content from a baseline of 170 ± 20 pmol/106 cells to 210 ± 20 pmol/106 cells, and a maximal increase to 515 ± 15 pmol/106 cells (p < 0.01) was achieved with 1,000 ng/ml. In contrast,asmase −/− hepatocytes failed to manifest increased ceramide levels at any Jo2 dose up to 8,000 ng/ml. Studies were also performed to determine the time course of ceramide elevation after Jo2 treatment using a 500-ng/ml dose (Fig.2 B). In asmase +/+ hepatocytes, ceramide levels increased to 1.6-fold of control by 30 s (p < 0.01), peaked at 5 min, and remained elevated for at least 20 min. asmase −/−hepatocytes, however, did not demonstrate elevation of ceramide levels at any time up to 20 min. Thus,asmase −/− hepatocytes display a complete defect in the early phase of ceramide generation upon Jo2 treatment. To evaluate whetherasmase −/− hepatocytes also displayed defects in Fas-mediated apoptosis, hepatocytes were rested for 1 h in RPMI 1640 complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum prior to treatment with Jo2 anti-Fas antibody. Prior investigations showed that Jo2 antibody induced time- and dose-dependent apoptosis in wild type hepatocytes in vivo and ex vivo (7Lin T. Genestier L. Pinkoski M.J. Castro A. Nicholas S.

Initial studies determined the time course of induction of apoptosis inasmase +/+ hepatocytes as measured by terminal nucleotidyl transferase using 1,000 ng/ml Jo2 antibody, a maximally effective dose. Apoptosis was detected by 2 h and was maximal by 8 h (not shown). Subsequent investigations measured the dose dependence of Jo2-induced apoptosis in asmase +/+hepatocytes after 8 h of treatment. As shown in Fig.3 A, apoptosis occurred over 2–3 logs of Jo2 doses; as little as 100 ng/ml Jo2 was effective; a maximal apoptotic effect was achieved using 2,000 ng/ml. Thus, the dose dependence for Jo2-induced ceramide generation is slightly lower than that for apoptosis. asmase −/−hepatocytes, which contain normal numbers of cell surface Fas receptors (Fig. 1), were nonetheless resistant to treatment with anti-Fas antibody. In contrast to the total resistance to ceramide generation, apoptosis was inducible by increasing the dose of Jo2 antibody about 1 log. Thus, apoptosis was elicited with a 2,000-ng/ml dose of Jo2 inasmase −/− hepatocytes and increased to a maximum at 8,000 ng/ml Jo2. Similar results were obtained using ethidium bromide and acridine orange staining to detect morphological changes of apoptosis (Fig. 3 B). These studies indicate that asmase −/−hepatocytes can undergo ASMase-dependent and -independent apoptosis after Jo2 treatment. Because the hepatocytes used in these studies were obtained by mechanical dispersion, we compared the effect of Jo2 to induce death using asmase +/+ andasmase −/− hepatocytes obtained by an alternative technique, in vivo collagenase treatment. For these studies, collagenase was delivered to intact livers after cannulation of the inferior hepatic vein and isolated hepatocytes derived as described (17Picardo A. Fong Y. Karpoff H.M. Yeh S.

Ionotropic glutamate receptor activation or depolarization activates transcription factor NF-κB and leads to translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We investigated the dynamics of NF-κB translocation in living neurons by tracing the NF-κB subunit RelA (p65) with jellyfish green fluorescent protein. We found that green fluorescent protein-RelA was located in either the nucleus or cytoplasm and neurites, depending on the coexpression of the cognate inhibitor of NF-κB, IκB-α. Stimulation with glutamate, kainate, or potassium chloride resulted in a redistribution of NF-κB from neurites to the nucleus. This transport depended on an intact nuclear localization signal on RelA. Thus, in addition to its role as a transcription factor, NF-κB may be a signal transducer, transmitting transient glutamatergic signals from distant sites to the nucleus.

Thus, in addition to its role as a transcription factor, NF-κB may be a signal transducer, transmitting transient glutamatergic signals from distant sites to the nucleus. For short-term signals (e.g. synaptic activity) to trigger long-term changes, differential gene expression is required (1Nguyen P.V. Abel T. Kandel E.R.

Casadio A. Zhu H., E.Y. Rose J.C. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Cell.. 1997; 91: 927-938Google Scholar). This raises the issue of determining the signaling systems that translate short-term signals to changes in gene expression. Two possible mechanisms are a signal transducer that is retrograde-transported and that subsequently transmits information to a transcription factor, or a transcription factor that independently can fulfill both functions. There is evidence for each mechanism in different systems. With regard to the former mechanism, the nerve growth factor TrkA receptor functions in complex with nerve growth factor as a retrograde signal transducer, connecting extracellular signals at distant sites with nuclear gene expression via phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB1 (5Riccio A. Pierchala B.A. Ciarallo C.L. Ginty D.D. Science.. 1997; 277: 1097-1100Google Scholar). NF-κB is a transcription factor that may act via the latter mechanism. Recently, it was reported that potentiated synapses are marked with a molecular tag that may sequester relevant proteins necessary for changes in gene expression (3Frey U. Morris R.G. Nature.. 1997; 385: 533-536Google Scholar). NF-κB is present in synaptic compartments (6Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Mech. Dev... 1993; 43: 135-147Google Scholar, 7Guerrini L. Blasi F.

NF-κB is present in many neuronal cell types (for review, see Ref. 12O'Neill L.A.J. Kaltschmidt C.

A physiological role was defined for NF-κB in neuroprotection against amyloid β-peptide (19Kaltschmidt B. Uherek M. Wellmann H. Volk B. Kaltschmidt C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res... 1997; 49: 681-697Google Scholar). Depending on the context, NF-κB might also be involved in neurodegeneration (22Post A. Holsboer F. Behl C. J. Neurosci... 1998; 18: 8236-8246Google Scholar). To date, five mammalian NF-κB DNA-binding subunits are known: p50, p52, RelA (p65), c-Rel, and RelB (23Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell.. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar, 24Baldwin A.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol... 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar). The important role of the transactivating RelA subunit is apparent in relAknockout mice, for which there is a high rate of embryonic mortality. Inhibitory subunits are IκB-α, IκB-β, IκB-γ (p105), IκB-δ (p100), and IκB-ε (25Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Semin. Cancer Biol... 1997; 8: 75-82Google Scholar). Within the nervous system, heteromeric NF-κB is most frequently composed of two DNA-binding subunits (e.g. p50 or RelA) that either are constitutively active or form a complex with the inhibitory subunit IκB-α (6Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Mech. Dev... 1993; 43: 135-147Google Scholar, 7Guerrini L. Blasi F. Denis D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 9077-9081Google Scholar, 13Rattner A. Korner M.

Hoppe-Seyler.. 1995; 376: 9-16Google Scholar). Interactive ankyrin repeats of IκB-α can physically block the nuclear localization signal (NLS) on the RelA subunit (27Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 25427-25435Google Scholar, 28Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell.. 1998; 95: 749-758Google Scholar), preventing transport of the complex into the nucleus. Activation of NF-κB results in the degradation of IκB-α, which in turn exposes the NLS, allowing NF-κB to be transported into the nucleus (29Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol... 1994; 12: 141-179Google Scholar). Thus, the specific post-translational regulation of NF-κB and its synaptic distribution support the idea that NF-κB functions both as a transcription factor in the nucleus, where it can function as a molecular switch for turning on gene expression, and as an immediate retrograde signal transducer, which unifies signal perception at distant sites (dendrites, axons, and synapses) (6Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Mech. Dev... 1993; 43: 135-147Google Scholar, 12O'Neill L.A.J. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci... 1997; 20: 252-258Google Scholar,30Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Trends Neurosci... 1998; 21: 106Google Scholar). It is not known, however, if NF-κB undergoes retrograde transport upon activation. In this study, we examined whether activated NF-κB RelA was transported from distant sites (neurites) to the nucleus in living cells using jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion technology to attach a fluorescent tag to the RelA subunit of NF-κB. To analyze the transport of NF-κB, a fusion protein was constructed that consisted of RelA and a GFP mutant optimized for maximal light emission (EGFP). This new technique offers the opportunity to image both the distribution and interactions of the protein in living cells. In contrast to intracellular antibody staining, using this technique, living cells can be observed over time, and small structures can be labeled, e.g. the label in dendritic spines can be greatly enhanced following overexpression of the GFP protein (31Fischer M. Kaech S. Knutti D. Matus A. Neuron.. 1998; 20: 847-854Google Scholar). Hippocampal neurons were cultured from embryonic day 17 or 18 rats as described by Banker and Cowan (32Banker G.A. Cowan W.M. Brain Res... 1977; 126: 397-425Google Scholar) and detailed by de Hoop et al. (33de Hoop M.J. Meyn L. Dotti C.G. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook.Academic Press. 1998; 1: 154-163Google Scholar). One day prior to preparation of the hippocampal neurons, neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with B27 (1:50; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5 mml-glutamine was conditioned by astrocyte co-culture. Dissected hippocampi were treated with trypsin (2 mg/ml; Sigma) in Hanks' balanced saline solution without calcium or magnesium and then with soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml). Neurons were dissociated by strokes with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette and were suspended in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts containing 1 mm pyruvate, 26 mmNa2HCO3, 2 mml-glutamine, 20 mm KCl, and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum. Cells (2 × 104cells/cm2) were plated on glass coverslips coated with polyethyleneimine (1:1000 in borate buffer, pH 7.2; Sigma). After 3 h, the cells adhered and were moved to astrocyte co-cultures with conditioned neurobasal medium. Biolistic experiments were performed after neurons had been maintained in culture for at least 7 days. At this age, the cultures contain mainlyN-methyl-d-aspartic acid type synapses clustered in varicosities (34Liao D. Zhang X. O'Brien R. Ehlers M.D. Huganir R.L. Nat. Neurosci... 1999; 2: 37-43Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were seeded on glass coverslips (104 cells/cm2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. The following day, calcium phosphate transfection was performed as described previously (26Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Henkel T. Stockinger H. Baeuerle P.A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler.. 1995; 376: 9-16Google Scholar); and 24 h later, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (14Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Neumann H. Wekerle H. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1994; 14: 3981-3992Google Scholar), and standardization was performed using Renilla reniformisluciferase together with Photinus pyralis luciferase (Dual-Luciferase, Promega, Mannheim, Germany) as suggested by the manufacturer. On day 8 in culture, hippocampal neurons were treated with either 100 or 500 μm glutamate or 100 μm kainate in glia-conditioned medium for 5 min. After two washing steps with neurobasal medium, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1, 1.5, or 2 h. The cells were then fixed for 2 min in ethanol and for 5 min in 3.7% formaldehyde. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated in 5% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature, followed by two 5-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated with anti-RelA monoclonal antibody (1:50 dilution; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim). Anti-RelA antibody was detected by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:400 dilution; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany); staining was performed subsequently; and detection was finished when incubation with the next primary antibody was started. Cells incubated with secondary antibodies, but without primary antibodies, were used as a control. The state of RelA activation in these cultures was tested using the anti-RelA monoclonal antibody because this antibody is commercially available and is specific for the activated form of the RelA subunit (26Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Henkel T. Stockinger H. Baeuerle P.A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler.. 1995; 376: 9-16Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity with this antibody is detectable only after the activation of NF-κB (16Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands), a pEGFP-1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), a cytomegalovirus-driven human RelA expression vector (37Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J... 1991; 10: 3805-3817Google Scholar), and a cytomegalovirus-driven human IκB-α vector (38Zabel U. Henkel T. Silva M.S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J... 1993; 12: 201-211Google Scholar) were used. A pcDNA3-EGFP expression plasmid was generated usingBamHI/NotI restriction of pEGFP-1 and sticky-end ligation of the purified fragment into pcDNA3. The pcDNA3-EGFP-RelA expression plasmid was constructed by recombinant polymerase chain reaction using Pwo/Taq DNA polymerases (Expand High Fidelity PCR system, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). pEGFP-1 was used as the template for polymerase chain reaction to amplify an EGFP fragment (769 base pairs) with forward primer A (5′-AAGCTTCGCCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTC-3′) and reverse primer B (5′-GAAGATGAGGGGGAACAGTTCGTCGGCCCCGGCCCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGAGAGTGAT-3′). At the 5′-end, the fragment carried a HindIII site and a Kozak consensus sequence (CGCCACC) and, at the 3′-end, a sequence encoding (Gly-Ala)2 and the first 30 base pairs from 5′-RelA. Using forward primer C (5′-GGCCGACGAACTGTTCCCCCTCATCTTCC-3′) and reverse primer D (5′-GGATCCTTAGGAGCTGATCTGAC-3′), a RelA fragment containing the first 361 amino acids including transactivation domain TA3, but without TA1 and TA2 (37Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J... 1991; 10: 3805-3817Google Scholar), was amplified using a 29-base pair overlap with the 3′-end of the EGFP fragment, with the pCMV-RelA expression plasmid used as a template. This strategy was chosen to avoid potential toxicity via the induction of neurotoxic NF-κB target genes. The 3′-end of the RelA fragment carried a stop codon and a BamHI restriction site. The recombinant fragment was ligated into the HindIII/BamHI site of the pcDNA3 vector. The NLS of the pcDNA3-EGFP-RelA expression vector was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis polymerase chain reaction (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Lys287, Lys290, and Arg291 were mutated to threonine residues (forward primer, 5′-GTCACCGGATTGAGGAGACACGTACAACGACATATGAGACCTTCAAG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-CTTGAAGGTCTCATATGTCGTTGTACGTGTCTCC TCAATCCGGTGAC-3′). Mutations were verified by sequencing. HEK 293 cells were grown on 10-cm culture dishes; and 1 day after calcium phosphate precipitation, the expression of EGFP-RelA and EGFP-(NLSmut)RelA was detected. Cells were treated with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% aprotinin, and the protein concentration was determined using Bradford dye reagent. Extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until used. Extracts containing 25 μg of protein were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer and separated on an SDS-gradient polyacrylamide minigel (4, 8, and 12%; Novel, Heidelberg, Germany). Proteins were transferred at 1.5 mA/cm2 for 1 h onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Chromogenic detection of alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibodies was performed with a chromogenic Western Blotting kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer. Nonspecific binding was blocked using 1% blocking solution for 30 min, and the blot was washed twice with 2× buffer containing 50 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5, for 10 min. Primary antibodies to GFP (0.4 μg/ml) and RelA (26Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Henkel T. Stockinger H. Baeuerle P.A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler.. 1995; 376: 9-16Google Scholar) were used (both from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (6Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Mech. Dev... 1993; 43: 135-147Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides (Promega) encompassing the NF-κB-binding site and the Sp1-binding site were labeled at the 5′-end with γ-32P and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions (20 μl) contained 20 μg of protein, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15,000 cpm labeled DNA, and probe buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Binding reactions were initiated by the addition of a DNA-binding mixture to the nuclear extracts at room temperature. For supershift analysis, anti-RelA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg) was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes. Reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA (1× Tris borate/EDTA = 89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. For competition experiments,32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes were mixed with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides prior to incubation with the nuclear extracts. Gold particles were coated, and cartridges were prepared as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad) with slight modifications (39Wellmann H. Kaltschmidt B. Kaltschmidt C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; : 9255-9264Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μg of gold (1 μm in diameter) was suspended in 60 μl of 0.05 mspermidine (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), and 60 μl of DNA (0.5 μg/μl) was added. DNA was precipitated on the particles using 60 μl of 2 m CaCl2. DNA-coated particles were suspended in 4 ml of a polyvinylpyrrolidone solution (0.05 mg/ml absolute ethanol; Sigma). Cartridges were prepared for use with the Helios Gene Gun (Bio-Rad) with a helium pressure of 100 p.s.i. Hippocampal neurons were imaged 24 h after biolistic transfection at 30 °C in custom-built observation chambers (courtesy of Prof. Dr. Rainer Greger) using an Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), high numerical aperture, oil immersion lenses, and a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (Carl Zeiss). Images were captured using a 2-s exposure every 20 min on Eastman Kodak 3200 ASA color slide films using light from a 50-watt mercury lamp (HBO50, Carl Zeiss). Care was taken to minimize exposure to the light. Cellular photodamage was prevented by perfusion via gravity feed with α-tocopherol (0.1 mm)-supplemented glia-conditioned medium after each exposure (31Fischer M. Kaech S. Knutti D. Matus A. Neuron.. 1998; 20: 847-854Google Scholar). Glutamate (100 or 500 μm) or kainate (50 or 100 μm) was added to the glia-conditioned medium for 5 min. Cells were washed twice, and movements of EGFP-RelA and EGFP-(NLSmut)RelA were observed for 2 h. Quantification of fluorescence intensities was performed as described previously (40Parent C.A. Blacklock B.J. Froehlich W.M. Murphy D.B. Devreotes P.N. Cell.. 1998; 95: 81-91Google Scholar), but without background subtraction, using IP-Lab-Spectrum software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). In brief, GFP fluorescence over distance was measured for untreated conditions (I 0) and after treatment (I) as values obtained after integrating the area under the plotted fluorescence intensities. For statistical evaluation, relative values (I/I 0 × 100) obtained from different neurites and experiments were pooled and analyzed as the experimental group containing EGFP-RelA versus the control group containing EGFP-RelA with a mutated NLS, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Pseudo-color images were created using NIH Image Version 1.61. To analyze the distribution of NF-κB, a GFP fusion protein containing RelA with its nuclear localization signal was constructed (Fig. 1 A). This construct contains only one weak transactivation domain, TA3 (37Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J... 1991; 10: 3805-3817Google Scholar), to avoid potential toxicity via induction of NF-κB target genes or via squelching (41Gill G. Ptashne M. Nature.. 1988; 334: 721-724Google Scholar) of other signal transduction pathways. The feasibility of using this GFP-RelA fusion protein to analyze nuclear transport was tested in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1 B). The EGFP-RelA fusion protein was found exclusively in the nucleus (Fig.1 B), whereas unfused EGFP was randomly distributed across all cellular compartments, including the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig.1 B). Overexpression of IκB-α resulted in the exclusion of EGFP-RelA from the nucleus (Fig. 1 B), consistent with the idea that IκB-α regulates the location of EGFP-RelA in the cell. In contrast, distribution of unfused EGFP was not influenced by the coexpression of IκB-α (Fig. 1 B). To biochemically characterize the fusion proteins, transfected HEK 293 cell extracts were separated on SDS gels and analyzed using Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). A band corresponding to the predicted protein molecular mass was detected with antibodies directed against either the RelA portion (Fig.2 A, lane 5) or the EGFP portion (lane 1) of the fusion protein. A second, faster migrating band was present that might be a degradation product. The specificity of the immunolabeling was tested via the expression of EGFP (Fig.2 A, lane 3), which was recognized only by the antibody to GFP and not by the antibody to RelA (lane 7). Similarly, overexpressed RelA was not detected by the antibody to GFP (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), but was detected by the antibody to RelA (lane 6). Mock-transfected cells did not react specifically with either antiserum (Fig. 2 A,lanes 4 and 8). The DNA-binding characteristics of the EGFP-RelA fusion protein were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 2 B). Using a κ enhancer probe, the binding of EGFP-RelA was examined. The probe bound strongly to EGFP-RelA (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). Supershifting with the antibody to RelA verified the identity of the EGFP-RelA complexes (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Antibody binding to EGFP-RelA was specifically competitively inhibited by unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 B, lane 4), but not by the nonspecific Sp1 oligonucleotide (lane 3). The transcriptional capability of the EGFP-RelA fusion protein was analyzed using an NF-κB-dependent luciferase vector (Fig.3, A and B). The fusion protein activated NF-κB-dependent transcription, whereas the control reporter, containing mutated NF-κB sites, was not activated (Fig. 3 A). Transcription mediated by EGFP-RelA was inhibited when IκB-α was coexpressed. In general, however, EGFP-RelA exhibited a lower transactivation capability compared with that of RelA (Fig. 3 B) due to the fact that this fusion protein contains only one weak transactivation domain (TA3) (37Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J... 1991; 10: 3805-3817Google Scholar). Deletion of strong transactivation domains was done to avoid potential toxicity via the induction of NF-κB target genes (42Kaltschmidt B. Sparna T. Kaltschmidt C. Antioxidants Redox Signal... 1999; 1: 129-144Google Scholar) or via squelching (41Gill G. Ptashne M. Nature.. 1988; 334: 721-724Google Scholar) of other signal transduction pathways. Taken together, the biochemical and cell biological data indicate that the behavior of the fusion protein was sufficiently similar to that of endogenous RelA to warrant using this EGFP-RelA construct to examine transport in living neurons. We constructed an EGFP-RelA fusion protein with a mutated NLS containing three point mutations (38Zabel U. Henkel T. Silva M.S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J... 1993; 12: 201-211Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). To study the mechanisms of transport into the nucleus of hippocampal neurons (Fig.4 B, left panels) or HEK 293 cells (right panels), cells were transfected as indicated. EGFP-RelA was localized primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 4 B), whereas EGFP-RelA with a mutated NLS was localized primarily in the cytoplasm, suggesting that an intact NLS is essential for a nuclear distribution of EGFP-RelA. Low levels of EGFP-RelA with a mutated NLS were detected in the nucleus, which might be due to additional auxiliary nuclear localization sequences (28Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell.. 1998; 95: 749-758Google Scholar). This effect was observed in both hippocampal neurons and HEK 293 cells, suggesting that the distribution of NF-κB may be regulated via this mechanism in both cell types. To activate the reconstituted EGFP-RelA complex via endogenous signal transduction pathways, it was necessary to avoid overloading the system with an overexpression of IκB-α. Therefore, it was essential to determine the least amount of IκB-α necessary to keep the EGFP-RelA fusion protein in the cytoplasm (Fig.5). The amount of the EGFP-RelA expression plasmid was kept constant, and different amounts of IκB-α expression plasmid were added. The ratios were calculated based on the molecular masses of the expression plasmids. For both hippocampal neurons (Fig. 5, a, c, ande) and HEK 293 cells (b, d, andf), increasing the concentration of IκB-α resulted in changes in the distribution of EGFP-RelA, from primarily nuclear (a and b), to nuclear or cytoplasmic for each specific cell (c and d), and finally to primarily cytoplasmic (e and f). In the cytoplasm, EGFP-RelA was observed within puncta. Based on these data, a ratio of 1:0.2 (EGFP-RelA/IκB-α) was used in the time course experiments described below. We determined whether endogenous NF-κB was activated by glutamate in a hippocampal neuron/glia co-culture (32Banker G.A. Cowan W.M. Brain Res... 1977; 126: 397-425Google Scholar, 33de Hoop M.J. Meyn L. Dotti C.G. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook.Academic Press. 1998; 1: 154-163Google Scholar). Without treatment, cells exhibited no nuclear staining, whereas following treatment with glutamate, nuclear staining was visible (data not shown). To examine whether treatment with the glutamate agonist kainate activated RelA in these cultured cells, as previously observed in cerebellar granule cells (16Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 9618-9622Google Scholar), we also examined the effects of kainate. A 5-min treatment with 100 μm kainate resulted in a robust activation of RelA after a delay of 90 min (Fig. 6). The use of a monoclonal antibody specific for the activated form of NF-κB allowed us to detect RelA in the neuronal nuclei induced by a brief 5-min kainate treatment. In addition, residual amounts of activated NF-κB could still be detected in neurites 90 min after a kainate pulse (Fig. 6, right panels), similar to thein vivo situation of hippocampal granule cells (10Kaltschmidt B. Deller T. Frotscher M. Kaltschmidt C. Neuroreport.. 2000; 11: 839-844Google Scholar). In processes of hippocampal granule cells, activated NF-κB is present, most likely due to permanent neuronal activity in these cells in vivo. Control cultures incubated with secondary (but not primary) antibody did not exhibit detectable staining (data not shown). Thus, the hippocampal cultures used here are very well suited to study transport of RelA. To investigate the stimulus-dependent transport of EGFP-RelA from neurites to the nucleus, cultures were treated with 100 mm KCl for 5 min (Fig. 7). Note that under control conditions, EGFP-RelA was localized in long neurites and in puncta resembling varicosities (Fig. 7, upper panel). Ninety min after treatment with KCl, EGFP-RelA was redistributed from neurites and the soma to the nucleus. Thus, we wished to test other stimuli for the capability to induce NF-κB redistribution from neurites to the nucleus. Therefore, we used time-lapse microscopy. To follow the transport of EGFP-RelA from neurites to the nucleus over time, cultures were treated with 500 μm glutamate after an adaptation time of several minutes following transfer to the imaging chamber (Fig. 8 A). After treatment, a gradual tra"

These bacterial proteins are important as immunochemical tools and model systems, but their biological function is still unclear. Here, we describe studies of three streptococcal proteins that bind IgA: the Sir22 and Arp4 proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes and the unrelated β protein of group B streptococcus. Analysis of IgA domain swap and point mutants indicated that two loops at the Cα2/Cα3 domain interface are critical for binding of the streptococcal proteins. This region is also used in binding the human IgA receptor CD89, an important mediator of IgA effector function. In agreement with this finding, the three IgA-binding proteins and a 50-residue IgA-binding peptide derived from Sir22 blocked the ability of IgA to bind CD89. Further, the Arp4 protein inhibited the ability of IgA to trigger a neutrophil respiratory burst via CD89. Thus, we have identified residues on IgA-Fc that play a key role in binding of different streptococcal IgA-binding proteins, and we have identified a mechanism by which a bacterial IgA-binding protein may interfere with IgA effector function.

Fcα receptor group B streptococcus IgA-binding protein 3-hydroxy-4-nitro-5iodophenylacetate phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Human IgA is abundant in the seromucous secretions that bathe mucosal surfaces, such as those lining the lungs, gut, and genitourinary tracts. These surfaces represent major potential sites of invasion, and the immune protection offered by secretory IgA, as the predominant antibody at these sites, serves as a critical “first line of defense” against many bacteria and viruses (1Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence is accumulating that IgA present in serum plays an important role in a “second line of defense” against microorganisms that have penetrated the mucosal barrier (2Janoff E.N. Fasching C. Orenstein J.M. Rubins J.B. Opstad N.L. Dalmasso A.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 3van Egmond M. van Garderen E. van Spriel A.B.

IgA performs the dual role of all antibodies, of both recognizing foreign invaders and triggering their elimination. For IgA, this latter effector function involves the interaction of its Fc region with an Fcα receptor (FcαRI,1CD89) expressed on neutrophils, eosinophils, or macrophages (4Morton H.C. van Egmond M.,. van de Winkel J.G. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 16: 423-440PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Ogra P.L. Mestecky J. Lamm M.E. Strober W. McGhee J.R. Bienenstock J. Mucosal Immunology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 213-224Google Scholar). After binding to antigen, IgA can interact with CD89 and elicit an array of potent eradication mechanisms, including phagocytosis, superoxide generation, and release of enzymes and inflammatory mediators (5Kerr M.A. Woof J.M. Ogra P.L. Mestecky J. Lamm M.E. Strober W. McGhee J.R. Bienenstock J. Mucosal Immunology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 213-224Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this important interaction between IgA and CD89 is now emerging, with the demonstration of the critical role played by two loops lying at the interface of the two domains of IgA-Fc (6Carayannopoulos L.

Surface proteins that bind human IgA-Fc have also been identified in many strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) and group B streptococcus (GBS), two important human pathogens (10Christensen P. Oxelius V.-A. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. C. 1975; 83: 184-188Google Scholar, 11Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Blake M.S. J. Exp.

Despite the importance of streptococci as pathogens, it is unclear what advantage the ability to bind IgA-Fc offers a bacterium during the establishment of an infection. However, even in the absence of information concerning their exact biological role, the IgA-binding proteins (IgA-BPs) are of considerable interest as immunochemical tools and model systems. A similar situation prevails for the well known bacterial IgG-binding proteins, staphylococcal protein A and streptococcal protein G, which have been extensively characterized (13Tashiro M. Montelione G.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but whose biological function is unknown. In S. pyogenes, the two IgA-BPs that have been studied in most detail are the Arp4 and Sir22 proteins (14Frithz E. Hedén L.-O. Lindahl G. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are members of the heterogeneous M protein family (16Kehoe M.A. N. Comp. Biochem. 1994; 27: 217-261Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These streptococcal proteins have 29-residue IgA-binding regions that are related, but not identical, making comparisons of interest (18Johnsson E. Andersson G. Lindahl G. Hedén L.-O. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3557-3564PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bessen D. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1968-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, these IgA-BPs bind human IgA of both subclasses and bind both serum IgA and secretory IgA (15Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Åkerström B. Lindqvist A. Lindahl G. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In GBS, binding of IgA is due to the β protein, which is unrelated to the IgA-BPs of S. pyogenes (21Hedén L.-O. Frithz E. Lindahl G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Jerlström P.G. Chhatwal G.S. Timmis K.N. Mol.

Valentin-Weigand P. Timmis K.N. Chhatwal G.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2787-2793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β protein binds human serum IgA of both subclasses and has the remarkable property that it binds poorly to secretory IgA, the molecular form of IgA that predominates on mucous membranes (24Lindahl G. Åkerström B. Vaerman J.-P. Stenberg L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2241-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here, we report experiments aimed at analyzing the interaction between IgA-Fc and streptococcal IgA-BPs. Experiments with domain swap antibodies and mutant IgAs indicate that binding of the different IgA-BPs, and a 50-residue synthetic IgA-binding peptide derived from the Sir22 protein (25Johnsson E. Areschoug T. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14521-14524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), depend on almost identical sites in the Fc interdomain region of IgA, the binding region also used by CD89. In agreement with these results, we demonstrate that the streptococcal IgA-BPs inhibit interaction of IgA with CD89, a property that may allow IgA-BPs to inhibit IgA effector function. The S. pyogenes strain AL168 expresses the Sir22 protein (15Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strain AL168mrp22- sir22− is a derivative of AL168 lacking expression of the two M proteins Mrp22 and Sir22 (26Thern A. Wästfelt M. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 860-869PubMed Google Scholar). The M-negative S. pyogenes strain JRS145 and its derivative JRS145/pJRS264, which expresses the Arp4 protein, have been described (27Husmann L.K. Scott J.R. Lindahl G. Stenberg L. Infect.

Med. 1984; 160: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was obtained from Dr. J. Michel (Channing Laboratory, Boston, MA). A β-negative derivative of A909 was constructed by replacement of the β gene with a kanamycin resistance cassette. 2T. Areschoug, manuscript in preparation. Streptococcal strains were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) at 37 °C without shaking. The S. pyogenes proteins Arp4 and Sir22 were purified after expression inEscherichia coli (15Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two deletion derivatives of Arp4 with nonoverlapping deletions in the IgA-binding region, the Arp4Δ450 and Arp4Δ451 proteins, were constructed and purified as described (18Johnsson E. Andersson G.

Med. 1993; 177: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Protein G was purchased from Calbiochem-Novagen Sciences (Nottingham, UK). A synthetic 50-residue IgA-binding peptide, derived from the Sir22 protein, has been described (25Johnsson E. Areschoug T. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14521-14524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This peptide contains a C-terminal C residue, not present in Sir22, that promotes dimerization and thereby enhances IgA-binding (30Åkerström B. Lindahl G. Björck L. Lindqvist A. J.

A 53-residue synthetic peptide (M5-N), derived from the N-terminal region of the non-IgA-binding streptococcal M5 protein, was purchased from the Department of Clinical Chemistry, MalmöGeneral Hospital, Sweden. This peptide includes 50 residues derived from the M5 protein and also includes the sequence YYC added at the C-terminal end, allowing radiolabeling at the tyrosine residues and dimerization via the cysteine residue. Analysis of purified bacterial proteins by Western blot was performed as described (29Stålhammar-Carlemalm M. Stenberg L. Lindahl G. J. Exp.

The blotting membranes were incubated with antiserum diluted 1000-fold, followed by incubation with radiolabeled protein G (for rabbit IgG) or protein A (for mouse IgG) and autoradiography. Control membranes were incubated with preimmune serum. All of the recombinant anti-NIP antibodies used were chimeric (heavy chains comprised human constant domains and murine variable domain; light chains (λ) were murine).

Recombinant antibodies were purified from supernatants of CHO-K1 transfectants by affinity chromatography on NIP-Sepharose (7Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol.

Nunc Maxisorp microtiter plates, coated overnight with 0.25 μg of appropriate streptococcal protein in fresh coating buffer (0.05 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6), were blocked with PBS containing 0.25% (w/v) gelatin and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. After three washes with water, 100 μl of appropriately diluted wild-type or mutant IgA1 or IgG1 in Glasgow minimum essential medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum were added per well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Following washing, 100 μl of rat monoclonal anti-mouse λ (λ1and λ2) light chain-biotin conjugate (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) diluted 1:2000 in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. This monoclonal antibody was used, since the light chains of the Igs studied here were of mouse origin. After washing, wells were incubated for 1 h with 100 μl of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Dako) diluted 1:2000 in PBST. After further washing, reactions were developed by incubating with substrate (Sigma Fast p-nitrophenyl phosphate tablets made up according to the manufacturer's instructions). The binding of the detecting antibody in the absence of IgA or IgG was used as the value for nonspecific binding and was subtracted from total binding to give specific binding values. Results from different experiments were normalized such that the fractional binding of wild-type IgA at 1 × 10−6m= 1.0. Washed suspensions of bacteria (∼5 × 109/ml) were prepared as described (26Thern A. Wästfelt M. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 860-869PubMed Google Scholar), and identical samples (200 μl) were added to each of a series of tubes. Different amounts of a purified Ig (in a volume of 50 μl) were added, giving the final concentrations indicated. After incubation for 2 h, the bacteria were washed twice with PBSAT (PBS with 0.02% NaN3 and 0.05% Tween 20), and the presence of bound Ig was analyzed by the addition of ∼15,000 cpm of125I-labeled rat anti-mouse λ light chain (Pharmingen). After incubation for 1 h and two washes with PBSAT, the radioactivity associated with the pelleted bacteria was determined in a γ-counter. All incubations were performed at room temperature. Binding is expressed as a percentage of the radioactivity added to each tube. Binding to control bacteria (≤1%) has been subtracted. All determinations were made in duplicate. Binding to Sir22 on the bacterial cell surface was analyzed withS. pyogenes strain AL168, using the non-IgA-binding mutant AL168mrp22- sir22− as a negative control. Binding to Arp4 on the surface of S. pyogenes was performed with strain JRS145/pJRS264, with JRS145 as the negative control, and binding to β on the surface of GBS was analyzed with strain A909, using a β-negative mutant of this strain as the negative control. Human erythrocytes were derivatized with NIP and sensitized with wild-type IgA1 at 200 μg/ml as described (7Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were isolated as described (7Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA (PBS/BSA). In the inhibition assay, which was essentially a modification of a previously described method (33Walker M.R. Kumpel B.M. Thompson K. Woof J.M. Burton D.R. Jefferis R. Vox Sang. 1988; 55: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), diluted coated erythrocytes and inhibitor protein (peptide, bacterial proteins, or their control peptide or proteins), both in PBS/BSA, were incubated at room temperature for 1 h (except for β protein and protein G, where overnight incubation was used) in wells of a V-bottomed microtiter plate. Neutrophils (∼50,000) in PBS/BSA were added and mixed carefully; the plates were incubated for 10 min, centrifuged at 50 × g for 5 min, and further incubated for 50 min. Following the addition of acridine orange solution (6 μg/ml final concentration) to stain nucleated cells, the suspensions were examined by fluorescence microscopy, defining a rosette as a fluorescent neutrophil with three or more erythrocytes attached. The results were normalized so that the mean rosetting level seen in the absence of inhibitor gave 0% normalized rosette inhibition. For each inhibitor, experiments were performed at least twice, each time using neutrophils from a different donor. The inhibition assay was essentially a modification of a previously described chemiluminescence assay of respiratory bursts (7Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Wells of a chemiluminescence microtiter plate (Dynex Technologies, Ashford, UK) were coated with NIP-BSA with subsequent incubation with wild-type IgA1 in PBS (100 μl/well at 50 μg/ml) for 1–2 h at room temperature. After washing, appropriately diluted inhibitor in Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% (w/v) globulin-free BSA (Hanks' buffered saline solution/BSA) was added. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature to allow prebinding of the inhibitor to the IgA, neutrophils in Hanks' buffered saline solution/BSA containing 260 μg/ml luminol were added (giving a final suspension of 0.25 × 106/ml), the plate was transferred to a Microlumat LB96P luminometer, and the chemiluminescence was measured at regular intervals. The ∼40-kDa Arp4 and Sir22 proteins from S. pyogenes are both members of the M protein family and share structural similarities, including a high degree of residue identity in the 29-residue IgA-binding region (Fig.1). As expected, antibodies to Sir22 were found to cross-react with Arp4 (Fig. 1). However, the ∼125-kDa β protein of GBS lacks residue identity with Arp4 and Sir22 and did not react with anti-Sir22 antibody; nor did anti-β antibodies recognize Arp4 or Sir22. These data confirm that the IgA-BPs of S. pyogenes and GBS are unrelated, underlining the interest in comparing their functional properties. To analyze the contribution of the Cα2 and Cα3 domains of IgA-Fc to the binding of streptococcal IgA-BPs, we used two domain swap antibodies in which homologous domains are exchanged between IgA1 and IgG1. These domain swaps are designated γ1γ2α3 (constant domain structure Cγ1, Cγ2, Cα3), and α1α2γ3 (constant domain structure Cα1, Cα2, Cγ3) (TableI). The ability of the constructs to bind the three streptococcal IgA-BPs and the IgA-binding peptide derived from Sir22 was analyzed by ELISA (Fig.2).Table IMutant antibodies usedAntibodyStructural notesDomain swap antibodiesα1α2γ3CH1, hinge and CH2 of human IgA1, and CH3 of human IgG1 (IgA-derived sequence ends at residue Ser341)γ1γ2α3CH1, hinge and CH2 of human IgG1, and CH3 of human IgA1 (IgA-derived sequence starts at Gly342)Cα2 domain LLG loop mutantsL257RLeu257 of human IgA1 replaced by ArgG259RGly259 of human IgA1 replaced by ArgCα3 domain PLAF loop mutantsP440RPro440 of human IgA1 replaced by ArgP440APro440 of human IgA1 replaced by AlaA442RAla442 of human IgA1 replaced by ArgF443RPhe443 of human IgA1 replaced by ArgLA441-442MNLeu441 and Ala442 replaced by Met and Asn, respectively Open table in a new tab Because intact Sir22 binds both IgA and IgG (15Stenberg L. O'Toole P.W. Mestecky J. Lindahl G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13458-13464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the IgA/IgG domain swap antibodies could not be used to provide information on the IgA binding requirements of Sir22. However, the Sir22-derived peptide, Arp4, and β protein did not bind wild-type IgG1 in the ELISA, so this approach was useful to illustrate the relative contributions of the two IgA-Fc domains to the interaction site. For all of these three IgA-binding molecules, we observed that the γ1γ2α3 antibody bound with an apparent affinity generally comparable with wild-type IgA1 (Fig. 2). In contrast, no binding was observed for the α1α2γ3 antibody. Several streptococcal proteins/peptides that do not bind IgA were used as controls, and all were unable to bind to either wild-type IgA1 or the swap antibodies. Together, these results suggest that the Cα3 domain makes a major contribution to the binding site for these IgA-binding molecules. To analyze whether the findings using purified bacterial IgA-binding proteins give a true reflection of the reactivity of the proteins when expressed on the bacterial cell surface, we performed binding studies with whole bacteria. Due to the IgG binding ability of the S. pyogenes strains expressing Sir22 and Arp4 (34Stenberg L. O'Toole P. Lindahl G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we were unable to analyze whole S. pyogenes bacteria for ability to bind the IgA/IgG domain swap antibodies but could perform studies with whole GBS bacteria expressing the β protein (Fig.3). Neither IgG1 nor the domain swap α1α2γ3 bound to the β-expressing GBS, while both wild-type IgA1 and the γ1γ2α3 antibody bound to these bacteria. Indeed, the γ1γ2α3 construct bound even better than IgA1 in this test. None of the constructs showed significant binding to an isogenic GBS mutant lacking expression of the β protein (data not shown). These results are consistent with a major role for the Cα3 domain of IgA in binding to the β protein. Although the data described above indicate that the Cα3 domain is of major importance for the binding of streptococcal IgA-BPs to IgA, they do not rule out the possibility that the Cα2 domain also makes a contribution, since regions in the Cγ2 domain in the γ1γ2α3 antibody may be able to adequately substitute for the corresponding parts of the Cα2 domain in the binding process. Data reported below suggest that this is indeed the case. Since the binding regions for the IgG-binding bacterial proteins staphylococcal protein A and streptococcal protein G have been localized to the Fc interdomain region of IgG (35Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 36Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Kleywegt G.J. Uhlén M. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 265-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the interdomain region of IgA-Fc might be directly involved in interaction with the streptococcal IgA-binding proteins. Studies of this region in IgA were also of interest because recent work has implicated two loops at the Cα2/Cα3 interface in the binding of IgA to human CD89 (6Carayannopoulos L. Hexham J.M. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We used a panel of IgA1 antibodies (7Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), each with a single or double amino acid substitution located in either of two predicted loops in the interdomain region, corresponding to Leu257–Gly259 in the Cα2 domain and Pro440–Phe443 in the Cα3 domain (Table I). These two predicted loops will be referred to as the LLG and PLAF loops. Molecular modeling (37Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1421-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) suggests that these two loops occupy positions in IgA analogous to interdomain loops in IgG that are essential for binding of staphylococcal protein A (35Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). The IgA proteins mutated in the two loops have Arg substitutions, since conversion to this bulky side chain in a critical residue was thought likely to be sufficient to ablate binding. However, several lines of evidence indicate that no gross conformational changes have been introduced into the IgA mutants (7Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Two mutants with single point mutations in the LLG loop, the L257R and G259R mutants, were assessed by ELISA for binding to the four streptococcal IgA-binding molecules (Fig.4 A). The G259R mutant had apparent affinities similar to those of wild-type IgA1. In contrast, the L257R mutant displayed slightly decreased binding to the Sir22-derived peptide, and more markedly decreased binding to intact Sir22 and to β protein, but was not affected in its ability to bind the Arp4 protein. Together, these data suggest that residues in the Cα2 region may play a role in the binding of streptococcal IgA-BPs and that the Arp4 and Sir22 proteins, which are closely related, may not have completely identical IgA-binding properties when tested in purified form. When the two Cα2 mutants were analyzed for binding to IgA-BPs expressed on the bacterial cell surface, a similar pattern emerged (Fig. 4 B). Thus, G259R bound to bacteria expressing Sir22, Arp4, or β with apparent affinities similar to those of wild-type IgA1. In contrast, L257R displayed strongly decreased ability to bind to each strain. The binding observed in this analysis with whole bacteria was due to the IgA-BPs, since bacterial mutants lacking expression of the different IgA-BPs were completely unable to bind any of the IgA proteins (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that the Gly259 residue does not play a role in interaction with any of the streptococcal IgA-BPs when they are expressed on the bacterial cell surface but that residue Leu257 may be involved. It is noteworthy that the L257R mutant showed strongly reduced binding to Arp4 expressed on bacteria, but not to purified Arp4 (Fig. 4A), stressing the importance of comparing binding tests performed with purified proteins and tests performed with whole bacteria. However, it should be noted that L257R is the only protein for which we have noted a clear difference between results obtained with purified proteins and with whole bacteria. The IgA antibodies with mutations in the Cα3 interface-proximal PLAF loop all had single amino acid substitutions with the exception of LA441-442MN (Table I). The effects of the substitutions on binding to purified proteins were similar for the three molecules originating from S. pyogenes,i.e. Sir22, the Sir22-derived peptide, and Arp4 (Fig.5 A). The A442R mutant bound all three molecules with affinity generally similar to wild-type IgA1, while the LA441-442MN mutant displayed binding consistent with a decrease in affinity of around 10-fold for Sir22 and the peptide and around 2–5-fold for Arp4. Mutant P440R showed only weak binding to the three IgA-binding molecules originating from S. pyogenes, with apparent reductions in affinity of greater than 100-fold, while the P440A and F443R mutants showed essentially no binding. Analysis of binding of these mutants to Sir22 or Arp4 expressed on the surface ofS. pyogenes produced a similar picture (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the binding of A442R to whole S. pyogenes bacteria was similar to that observed with wild-type IgA1. In contrast, P440R and F443R displayed markedly reduced binding, while no binding was observed for P440A, i.e. the effect on"
https://openalex.org/W2112078030,"D-type cyclins (CycD) play key roles in linking the Arabidopsis cell cycle to extracellular and developmental signals, but little is known of their regulation at the post-transcriptional level or of their cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) partners. Using new antisera to CycD2 and CycD3, we demonstrate that the CDK partner of these Arabidopsis cyclins is the PSTAIRE-containing CDK Cdc2a. Previous analysis has shown that transcript levels of CycD2 and CycD3 are regulated in response to sucrose levels and that both their mRNA levels and kinase activity are induced with different kinetics during the G(1) phase of cells reentering the division cycle from quiescence. Here we analyze the protein levels and kinase activity of CycD2 and CycD3. We show that CycD3 protein and kinase activity parallel the abundance of its mRNA and that CycD3 protein is rapidly lost from cells in stationary phase or following sucrose removal. In contrast to both CycD3 and the regulation of its own mRNA levels, CycD2 protein is present at constant levels. CycD2 kinase activity is regulated by sequestration of CycD2 protein in a form inaccessible to immunoprecipitation and probably not complexed to Cdc2a."
https://openalex.org/W1977385837,"Ssc1, the major Hsp70 of the mitochondrial matrix, is involved in the translocation of proteins from the cytosol into the matrix and their subsequent folding. To better understand the physiological mechanism of action of this Hsp70, we have undertaken a biochemical analysis of Ssc1 and two mutant proteins, Ssc1–2 and Ssc1–201. ssc1–2 is a temperature-sensitive mutant defective in both translocation and folding; ssc1–201contains a second mutation in this ssc1 gene that suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect ofssc1–2, correcting the translocation but not the folding defect. We found that although Ssc1 was competent to facilitate the refolding of denatured luciferase in vitro, both Ssc1–2 and Ssc1–201 showed significant defects, consistent with the data obtained with isolated mitochondria. Purified Ssc1–2 had a lowered affinity for a peptide substrate compared with wild-type Ssc1 but only in the ADP-bound state. This peptide binding defect was reversed in the suppressor protein Ssc1–201. However, a defect in the ability of Hsp40 to stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssc1–2 was not corrected in Ssc1–201. Thus, the inability of these two mutant proteins to efficiently facilitate luciferase refolding correlates with their defect in stimulation of ATPase activity by Hsp40s, indicating that this interaction is critical for protein folding in mitochondria. Ssc1, the major Hsp70 of the mitochondrial matrix, is involved in the translocation of proteins from the cytosol into the matrix and their subsequent folding.

Thus, the inability of these two mutant proteins to efficiently facilitate luciferase refolding correlates with their defect in stimulation of ATPase activity by Hsp40s, indicating that this interaction is critical for protein folding in mitochondria. dihydrofolate reductase wild type Molecular chaperones such as members of the 70-kDa class (Hsp70s) bind to nonnative conformations of proteins, thus facilitating their folding and translocation across membranes (1Craig E.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1902-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 28-kDa region of Hsp70s binds unfolded polypeptides, whereas the highly conserved N-terminal 44-kDa domain regulates that binding through its interaction with adenine nucleotides (3Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). It is thought that Hsp70 proteins, like many GTPases, have a two-state conformation. When an ADP molecule is bound in the nucleotide-binding site, the Hsp70 exhibits relatively stable polypeptide substrate binding; when ATP is bound, binding of substrate is relatively unstable. The 44-kDa domain has a low intrinsic ATPase activity; therefore, ATP hydrolysis converts Hsp70 to a form having a relatively stable interaction with unfolded proteins. Exchange of ADP for ATP results in destabilization of the interaction. It is thought that a polypeptide first interacts with a Hsp70 in the ATP-bound state, and then hydrolysis of ATP to ADP stabilizes this interaction. This cycle of interaction is facilitated by cochaperones. Procaryotes and mitochondria contain Hsp40-type cochaperones as well as nucleotide release factors such as GrpE of Escherichia coli and Mge1 ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (4Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Sakuragi S. Liu Q. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11275-11282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the simplest scenario, nucleotide release factors are thought to destabilize the interaction of unfolded proteins with Hsp70, as release of ADP from a DnaK·ADP complex can be increased up to 5000-fold by GrpE action (4Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, the action of Hsp40s such as DnaJ of E. coli is less well understood. Hsp40s stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70s, which is thought to facilitate their binding to unfolded polypeptide substrates (6Kelley W.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R305-R308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Hsp40s contain a canonical J domain that interacts with the ATPase domain of Hsp70s (7Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). There may also be a site of interaction of Hsp40s with the C-terminal domain of Hsp70s, since mutant Hsp70s that show a defect in interaction with peptide substrates also show a defect in interaction with Hsp40s (8Suh W.-C. Burkholder W. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M. Gross C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9Davis J.E. Voisine C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9269-9276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition to interacting with Hsp70s, many Hsp40s, including E. coli DnaJ, bind unfolded or partially folded polypeptides, preventing their aggregation (10Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Based on a variety of in vitro analyses, a model of how Hsp40s and Hsp70s cooperate in protein folding has evolved (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar, 3Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). Polypeptide substrates first bind Hsp40. Then, the ATPase domain of Hsp70 interacts with Hsp40 via its J domain. This interaction not only brings the substrate in close proximity to Hsp70, but it also stimulates hydrolysis of ATP, trapping the substrate. Subsequent release of nucleotide and rebinding of ATP destabilize the Hsp70-substrate complex, resulting in its release. In eucaryotes, all major cellular compartments contain at least one Hsp70 and one Hsp40. Ssc1, the major Hsp70 of the mitochondrial matrix, is involved in the translocation of proteins from the cytosol across the mitochondrial inner membrane to the matrix and their subsequent folding. Two temperature-sensitive mutants, ssc1–2 andssc1–3, have been used extensively in the analysis of the physiological roles of Ssc1 (11Kang P.J. Ostermann J. Shilling J. Neupert W. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Nature. 1990; 348: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 12Gambill B.D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J.

The ssc1–3 mutation causes an amino acid substitution in the ATPase domain that results in severe defects in translocation. The ssc1–2 mutation, which changes a single amino acid in the peptide binding domain (P442S) (12Gambill B.D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), has less severe effects and is therefore more useful in dissecting the roles of Ssc1 in both translocation and folding. Intragenic suppressors of ssc1–2, which cause an additional single amino acid alteration in the peptide binding domain of Ssc1–2, have been isolated. These suppressor mutations allow robust growth at the intermediate temperature of 34 °C but do not completely suppress the growth defect of ssc1–2 above that temperature. Two of these, Ssc1–201 and Ssc1–202 (D519E and V524I, respectively) have been analyzed (15Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Both suppress the defects in protein translocation as well as the interaction with the membrane tether Tim44. However, initial results suggested that the folding defect is not suppressed (15Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of Ssc1 in protein folding within the mitochondrial matrix, we have undertaken a characterization of the biochemical properties of Ssc1, Ssc1–2, and Ssc1–201. We found that neither the ATPase activity of Ssc1–2 nor of the suppressor protein Ssc1–201 was stimulated by Hsp40s. In addition, both show significant defects in their ability to facilitate the refolding of luciferasein vitro. These results make evident the importance of Hsp40s in facilitating protein folding in the mitochondrial matrixin vivo and provide insight into the complex interactions between Hsp40s and Hsp70s. pRS314-SSC1(His tag) was constructed from pRS314-SSC1 (16Miao B.

Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and DHFR* (17Hajek P. Koh J.Y. Jones L. Bedwell D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7169-7177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A PstI/BstXI fragment of the final polymerase chain reaction product was inserted into pGEM-Su9-DHFR to replace the wild-type (WT) portion of DHFR. The plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme digests. The yeast strain used for Ssc1 purification was obtained by crossingWY11 (his3–11, 15 leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 trp1-Δ1 pep4::HIS3) withPJ53–52C (trp1–1 ura3–1 leu2–3, 112 his3–11, 15 ade2–1 can1–100 GAL2+ met2-Δ1 lys2-Δ2 ssc1ΔClaI::LEU2 pRS316-SSC1) followed by sporulation and dissection to generate a strain of the genotypepep4::HIS3 trp1–1 ssc1ΔClaI::LEU2 pRS316-SSC1 (QL1). After transforming QL1 with pRS314-SSC1(His tag) containing mutant or WT versions ofSSC1, cells lacking pRS316-SSC1 were selected on 5-fluoroorotic acid plates. The resulting yeast strains QL2(ssc1–2), QL3 (ssc1–201),QL4 (ssc1–202), and QL5 (WTSSC1) have a His-tag version of SSC1 as the only copy of SSC1 and were used to purify Ssc1 wild-type and mutant proteins. Mitochondria were isolated from wild-type and ssc1mutant (ssc1–2 and ssc1–201) yeast strains grown at 25 °C in YPGlycerol media (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol, and 2% ethanol) as described previously (12Gambill B.D.

Precursor proteins Su9-DHFR and Su9-DHFR* were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. Before import, the precursor proteins were denatured by 7 murea, and mitochondria were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to induce the temperature-sensitive phenotype. The import reactions and subsequent immunoprecipitations using Ssc1 antibodies were carried out as described (15Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, after import for 2 min at 25 °C, the import reaction was stopped by the addition of valinomycin. Mitochondria were further incubated at 25 °C for various times then lysed with Triton X-100 buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). After a clarifying spin, the extract was incubated with Ssc1 antibody cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The imported proteins bound to the protein A-Sepharose beads were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and digital autoradiography. To assess folding of imported proteins, a 2-min import reaction was carried out. Mitochondria were then disrupted with 0.6% Triton X-100 and treated with proteinase K (15 μg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 15 min on ice. After the digestion was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and digital autoradiography. The yeast strains QL2, QL3,QL4, and QL5 were grown at 25 °C in YPGlycerol media. Cells were harvested at A600 = 1.0–1.5, and mitochondria were isolated as described previously with some modifications (12Gambill B.D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment with zymolyase (0.45 mg/ml) (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA), the cells were homogenized in homogenization buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Mitochondria were separated from unbroken cells and nuclei by 2,300 × g centrifugation for 5 min and pelleted from other cytosolic components by 20,000 × gcentrifugation for 12 min. The mitochondria pellet was resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100 in IMAC buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The extract was loaded onto a nickel column (Novagen, Madison, WI) equilibrated with IMAC buffer. After washing with IMAC buffer including 1 mm ATP, 1m KCl, the column was eluted with an imidazole gradient (20–240 mm in IMAC buffer). The fractions containing Ssc1 protein were pooled and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with low salt buffer (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol). After washing with low salt buffer, Ssc1 was eluted with high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 240 mm KCl, 10% glycerol). The fractions containing Ssc1 protein were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −75 °C. Mge1, Mdj1, and DnaJ were purified as described before (9Davis J.E. Voisine C. Craig E.A. Proc.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Peptide P5 (CALLLSAPRR) was labeled with fluorescein to generate F-P5 as described (21Montgomery D.L. Morimoto R.I. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 915-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of Ssc1 proteins were incubated with F-P5 (10 nm) at 25 °C in buffer A (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 11 mm magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol). After binding reached equilibrium, anisotropy measurements were made with the Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization system (Panvera, Madison, WI) at 25 °C with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 535 nm. The data were fitted to a quadratic single site binding equation by using Microsoft EXCEL to calculate theKd. In experiments utilizing ADP, Ssc1 was incubated with 500 μm nucleotide for 15 min in buffer A. Similar results were obtained with Ssc1 proteins with and without a 37 °C preincubation and in the absence of ADP. For the binding in the presence of ATP, Ssc1 proteins were incubated with 2 mm ATP at 25 °C for 30 s in buffer A, then F-P5 was added. By 2 min, before significant hydrolysis occurred, binding equilibrium was reached, and anisotropy readings were taken. F-P5 (10 nm) was incubated with Ssc1 proteins at a concentration of ∼5 μm. At this Ssc1 concentration, >80% F-P5 was bound to wild-type and mutant Ssc1 proteins at equilibrium. After the addition of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled P5 to the reaction, anisotropy measurements were taken every 10 s to monitor the release of F-P5. The release rate koff was calculated by fitting the release curve to one phase exponential decay using Prism 2.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Ssc1·ATP complexes were isolated as described (16Miao B. Davis J.E. Craig E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), with several modifications. 25 μg of Ssc1 protein was incubated with 100 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (DuPont, 3000 Ci/mmol) in buffer A containing 25 μm ATP in a 100-μl final volume on ice for 4 min. The complex was isolated immediately on a NICK column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Single-turnover ATPase assays were performed as described (16Miao B. Davis J.E. Craig E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) at 25 °C in buffer A in the presence of different proteins (Mge1, Mdj1, or DnaJ) and peptide P5 at various concentrations. At the indicated times, the reaction was stopped, and the percent conversion of ATP to ADP was determined. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated by fitting the data to a first-order rate equation by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 2.0. Firefly luciferase (4 μm) was denatured for 3 h at 30 °C in buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mmmagnesium acetate) containing 6 m urea. For refolding, diluted luciferase (50 nm) was incubated at 25 °C for 2 h in buffer B (40 μl) supplemented with ATP (5 mm), an ATP regenerating system (10 mmphosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml phosphocreatine kinase), 0.15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and chaperone proteins as indicated in the figure legends. The luciferase activity was determined in a Beckman scintillation counter using the luciferase assay system E1500 (Promega, Madison, WI). To study protein folding within the mitochondrial matrix, DHFR was utilized as a test substrate. A protein, Su9-DHFR, containing a presequence that directs the protein synthesized in the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix fused to the mouse DHFR was synthesized in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. The synthesized protein was denatured with urea and imported into mitochondria isolated from wild-type,ssc1–2, and ssc1–201cells. In agreement with previous results (15Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), this unfolded protein was imported intossc1–2 as efficiently as into mitochondria from wild-type or ssc1–201 cells, as very similar amounts of radiolabeled protein were imported into the 3 mitochondria preparations (Fig.1 A). The folding state of the imported DHFR was assessed by testing its susceptibility to digestion by protease. After import, the isolated mitochondria were disrupted by Triton X-100, and the extracts were treated with proteinase K. 49% of imported DHFR was proteinase K-resistant in wild-type mitochondria, whereas only 17% was resistant in ssc1–2 mitochondria. 23% of imported DHFR was resistant in ssc1–201mitochondria. Therefore, both ssc1–2 andssc1–201 mitochondria are defective in the folding of this test substrate. However, DHFR imported into ssc1–201mitochondria consistently showed slightly more proteinase K resistance than that in ssc1–2 mitochondria. Since we observed a defect in folding in ssc1–2 andssc1–201 mitochondria, we wanted to test the ability of the mutant proteins to function in the refolding of denatured proteinsin vitro. First we developed a purification scheme for wild-type and mutant Ssc1 proteins. We utilized an SSC1 gene encoding a C-terminal polyhistidine extension. These constructs rescued the lethality of the Δssc1 mutation, and strains carrying His-tagged mutant versions maintained the same temperature-sensitive growth phenotype as those carrying untagged genes (data not shown). Under the conditions used, refolding of denatured luciferase was dependent upon the presence of Ssc1, the mitochondrial Hsp40 Mdj1, and the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1 as well as Hsp78, a member of the Hsp100 family of chaperones that facilitates disaggregation of protein aggregates (22Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 23Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ssc1, less than 1% of luciferase activity was recovered, whereas in the presence of Ssc1, ∼60% of luciferase activity was found as compared with the native luciferase (Fig. 2 A). However, Ssc1–2 was not able to significantly facilitate the refolding of luciferase under any condition tested. In addition, no activity of Ssc1–201 was observed at low concentrations of Ssc1, where the refolding activity of wild-type Ssc1 is nearly maximal (1 μm). However, at increasing concentrations, some refolding activity was observed, reaching about 45% maximal wild-type activity at 6 μm. Therefore, although the suppressor protein has some refolding activity, it is severely compromised compared with wild-type protein. This result is consistent with the slightly increased level of resistance of imported DHFR to protease inssc1–201 mitochondria compared with ssc1–2mitochondria, even though the level of Ssc1 protein is similar in all three types of mitochondria (data not shown). Ssc1 interaction with imported proteins can be monitored in mitochondria by testing for the ability of Ssc1-specific antibodies to coimmunoprecipitate radiolabeled imported protein. In wild-type mitochondria, this association is transient. Consistent with previously published results (15Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 24Manning-Krieg U.C. Scherer P. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3273-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), only a low percentage of imported protein, about 5%, was immunoprecipitated immediately after import (Fig.3 A). With time, that amount decreased, to 1–2% by 15–35 min after import. Significantly larger amounts of DHFR were coimmunoprecipitated in ssc1–2 andssc1–201 mitochondria. Initially 12–15% was precipitated; by 35 min after import, 7–9% was precipitated. Thus, ssc1–2 and ssc1–201 mitochondria showed a defect in folding of DHFR and a prolonged association with imported protein. Two possible explanations for the prolonged association came to mind. First, Ssc1–2 and Ssc1–201 might have an increased affinity for unfolded proteins. Perhaps the substrates are released more slowly once they have bound to the mutant Hsp70, causing this prolonged association. Alternatively, the mutant Hsp70s might have normal interaction with unfolded proteins but be defective in other interactions, resulting in a defect in folding. Proteins would thus remain in a partially unfolded state for a long period of time and remain substrates for Ssc1 binding. In this case each DHFR molecule would undergo many more cycles of interaction with mutant Ssc1 proteins, causing an apparent prolonged interaction. We proceeded to test these ideas. To examine substrate binding properties, wild-type, Ssc1–2, and Ssc1–201 proteins were tested in a fluorescence anisotropy-based peptide binding assay. This assay has been previously used to assess the interaction of peptide substrates with DnaK (9Davis J.E. Voisine C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9269-9276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Montgomery D.L. Morimoto R.I. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 915-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For studies of Ssc1, a model peptide P5 (CALLLSAPRR), having a portion of the mitochondrial-targeting sequence of aspartate aminotransferase from chicken, was selected. P5 was fluorescently labeled on its N-terminal cysteine with fluorescein (F-P5). The anisotropy assay follows the relative rotational diffusion of the fluorescein after excitation with polarized light. Because of its small size, F-P5 should rotate in solution rather rapidly and, thus, have a low anisotropy value. When F-P5 is bound to Ssc1, it should rotate more slowly and, thus, display a significantly higher anisotropy value. Binding assays were performed using increasing concentrations of Ssc1 protein, and the increase in anisotropy was fitted to a single-site binding model. Analysis of wild-type Ssc1 binding experiments, carried out in the presence of ADP, yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.22 (±0.036) μm (Fig.4, A and B). Ssc1–2 showed about a 5-fold lower affinity for peptide, having aKd of 1.1 (±0.095) μm. However, the affinity of Ssc1–201 for peptide was only slightly lower than that of wild-type, having a Kd of 0.28 (±0.031) μm. Therefore, the suppressor mutation appears to have significantly reversed the defect of Ssc1–2 in binding peptide substrate. To look at the defect of Ssc1–2 in more detail, we monitored the displacement of the prebound F-P5 after the addition of a large excess of unlabeled P5 by measuring the decrease in anisotropy. Upon the addition of P5 to a wild-type Ssc1·F-P5 complex, the anisotropy change showed a single phase with a rate constant of 0.0024 (±0.000022) s−1 (Fig. 4 C). Experiments with Ssc1–2 revealed a very similarkoff (0.0028 (±0.000059) s−1). This small difference inkoff observed using ADP-bound Ssc1–2 cannot account for the 5-fold difference in Kd observed. Therefore, we conclude that this difference in Kd is due to a difference in the on-rate of peptide. Similar values were obtained when the experiments were performed in the absence of nucleotide. We also tested the suppressor protein Ssc1–201 to determine the basis of the restoration of the Kd to wild-type levels. The koff was decreased about 2.2-fold compared with wild-type protein, 0.0011 (±0.0000062) s−1 compared with 0.0024 s−1. Therefore, to obtain aKd similar to wild-type, thekon of Ssc1–201 would need to be 2.8-fold slower than that of wild type. We proposed that both thekon and koff are affected by the suppressor mutation, resulting in a nearly normal affinity. The affinity of Hsp70 for peptide substrates is much lower in the ATP-bound form than in the ADP-bound form (25Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 26Greene L.E. Zinner R. Naficy S. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2967-2973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As expected, upon the addition of ATP, the anisotropy readings rapidly decreased, indicating peptide release. Because of the rapidity of this reduction, we were unable to compare the rate of release of peptide upon ATP addition among the different proteins. To look more carefully at the interaction of Ssc1 with peptide when it is in the ATP-bound state, we carried out anisotropy assays in the presence of ATP. As expected, in the presence of ATP, the affinity for peptide of both wild-type Ssc1 and Ssc1–2 was dramatically reduced (Fig. 4 A). Because of this reduction we were unable to approach saturation of binding. However, the affinity of wild-type Ssc1 and Ssc1–2 appears similar, based on the increase in anisotropy observed at high concentrations of protein. We estimate that theKd of both wild-type and Ssc1–2 proteins in the ATP-bound form is on the order of 20 μm, if at saturation the anisotropy reading is similar to that of the ADP-bound form. Therefore, there is about a 90-fold difference between the affinity of the ATP and ADP form of wild-type protein for P5. This difference is similar to the difference in affinity of ATP and ADP-bound DnaK for peptides (25Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P.

However, the intracellular pathway for transducing PTH/PTH-related peptide signals in chondrocytes remains unclear. Here, we show that this pathway is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Incubation of hypertrophic chondrocytes with PTH (1–34) induces an inhibition of p38 kinase activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of protein kinase C prevents PTH-induced p38 MAPK inhibition, whereas inhibition of protein kinase A has no effect. Thus, protein kinase C, but not protein kinase A, is required for the inhibition of p38 MAPK by PTH. Treatment of hypertrophic chondrocytes by PTH or by p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 up-regulates Bcl-2, suggesting that Bcl-2 lies downstream of p38 MAPK in the PTH signaling pathway. Inhibition of p38 MAPK in hypertrophic chondrocytes by either PTH, SB303580, or both together leads to a decrease of hypertrophic marker type X collagen mRNA and an increase of the expression of prehypertrophic marker cartilage matrix protein. Therefore, inhibition of p38 converts a hypertrophic cell phenotype to a prehypertrophic one, thereby preventing precocious chondrocyte hypertrophy. Taken together, these data suggest a major role for p38 MAPK in transmitting PTH signals to regulate chondrocyte differentiation.

Cells from these different stages of differentiation synthesize specific molecules, for example, type X collagen is synthesized specifically by hypertrophic chondrocytes (2Schmid T.M.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) are major regulators of the chondrocyte differentiation process. PTH and PTHrP both bind to PTH receptors, which belong to G protein-coupled receptors (4Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). In a growth plate, PTH receptors are expressed at specific stages during chondrocyte differentiation, with the highest level at the prehypertrophic to hypertrophic transition (5Iwamoto M. Jikko A.

This suggests that PTH receptors may be important for the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation from the prehypertrophic state to the hypertrophic state. Indeed, overexpression of PTHrP or its constitutively active receptor in growth plates of transgenic mice delays endochondral bone formation (6Schipani E. Lanske B. Hunzelman J. Luz A. Kovacs C.S.

Thus, the PTH/PTHrP receptor plays a fundamental role in the control of endochondral bone formation by transducing signals inhibiting chondrocyte hypertrophy. However, the intracellular signaling mechanism for PTH/PTHrP to regulate chondrocyte differentiation remains unknown. The PTH/PTHrP receptor may exert its biological action via at least two signaling pathways, i.e. elevating intracellular cAMP, thereby activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) or activating phospholipase C that results in an increase in intracellular free calcium and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (10Abou-Samra A.B. Jueppner H. Westerberg D. Potts Jr., J.T. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Bcl-2, an anti-apoptosis molecule, is also involved in the PTH/PTHrP signaling pathway in chondrocytes (11Amling M. Neff L. Tanaka S. Inoue D. Kuida K. Weir E. Philbrick W.M. Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In this study, we will determine the involvement of PKA and PKC pathways in transducing PTH/PTHrP signals to regulate chondrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, the signaling molecules downstream of PKA or PKC that mediate PTH/PTHrP regulation of chondrocyte differentiation will be defined. We will present the evidence that a stress-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 is a central link to connect PTH signaling to the regulation of chondrocyte hypertrophy. Recent studies indicate that stress-induced MAPK superfamily, which includes p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), is important for regulating cell differentiation and apoptosis by transmitting extracellular signals to the nucleus (12Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). However, the roles of JNK and p38 MAPK in the regulation of chondrocyte terminal differentiation–hypertrophy are not known. p38 MAPK and JNK are serine and threonine protein kinases that are activated by osmotic pressure, stress, and cytokines (13Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In addition, several growth factors and G protein-coupled receptors may also activate p38 MAPK and JNK (14Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The functional difference between p38 MAPK and JNK can be distinguished using a selective kinase inhibitor SB203580 that inhibits only p38 but not JNK activities (15Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The aim of this study is to test whether stress-activated MAPKs are involved in the regulation of chondrocyte hypertrophy by PTH. If so, which specific MAPK pathway regulates chondrocyte differentiation? We show here that in primary chick hypertrophic chondrocytes PTH inhibits p38 MAPK activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner but has little effect on JNK activity. The inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by PTH appears to be mediated by PKC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of p38 MAPK activity is a signaling mechanism responsible for regulation of chondrocyte terminal differentiation by PTH/PTHrP. PTH (1–34), myelin basic protein (MBP), calphostin C, and thyroxin were purchased from Sigma. Dibutyryl-cAMP and H89 were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). SB203580 was from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad. Agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10) and c-Jun (169) GST were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-p38 MAPK, anti-JNK1, anti-BCL-2, and protein A/G were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies including anti-CMP and anti-link protein were prepared as described previously (16Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit/mouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Pierce. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ham's F-12 medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. Primary chondrocyte cultures were established as described previously (1Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, hypertrophic chondrocytes were obtained from the cephalic part of sterna cartilage from 17-day-old embryonic chickens, and prehypertrophic chondrocytes were obtained from the caudal part of the cartilage. We chose 17-day-old embryonic chickens because the cephalic part of sterna cartilage contains early hypertrophic chondrocytes that just started to synthesize type X collagen (3Gibson G.J. Flint M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cartilage pieces were incubated with 0.1% testicular hyaluronidase, 0.3% collagenase for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were replaced with fresh medium containing enzymes, and incubation was continued for additional 1 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and maintained in plating medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% O2 at 37 °C. At about 80–90% confluence, cells were incubated with 0.5% fetal bovine serum medium overnight before experiments. After cells were treated with PTH or other agents for designated time, reactions were stopped by aspirating the medium and washing twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. For immunoblot and protein phosphorylation analysis, cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 3 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For the kinase activity assay, cells were lysed in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 3 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were centrifuged 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to precipitate debris. The protein content of supernatant was determined. Aliquots of supernatant were used for immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting (see below). After an aliquot (200 μg of proteins) of cell lysate was incubated with 1 μg of anti-p38 MAPK or 2 μg of anti-JNK1 overnight at 4 °C, 15 μl of protein A/G Plus (Santa Cruz, CA) was then added to the tubes for additional 2 h of incubation. Immune complex was washed three times with buffer B and twice with kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm Na3VO4). Kinase activity assays were performed in kinase assay buffer in the presence of 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi), 0.2 mg/ml MBP (for p38 MAPK), or 2 μg of c-Jun GST (for JNK), as described previously (17Zhen X. Uryu K. Wang H.Y. Friedman E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 2× sample buffer. The products were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm loading of equal amounts of substrate. The phosphorylation of MBP was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager. To determine PKB activity, cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-AKT1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz, CA), and kinase activity assay was performed using cross-tide peptide (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as substrate, as previously described (18Lali F.V. Hunt A.E. Turner S.J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7395-7402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To determine tyrosine phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK, 0.5 mg of supernatant protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10). Immunoprecipitates were collected and washed three times with buffer A. The immune complex was then resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS gel electrophoresis. After transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, the blots were probed with anti-p38 MAPK antibody. The signals were visualized with Supersignal Western blot Detection System (Pierce). For determining protein expression of Bcl-2, CMP, and link protein, 20 μg of protein was loaded in each lane of 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the corresponding antibody. The signals were then visualized as described above. After cells were treated with PTH or other reagents, total cellular RNA was isolated from chondrocytes with RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen). The relative content of mRNA was quantified by real time quantitative PCR using respective probe and primer for CMP or type X collagen. For chick CMP mRNA, the forward and reverse primers were 5′-AGGGCTTCACGCTGAACAAT-3′ and 5′-AGGGCAGATCCTGACCCAC-3′, respectively. The internal probe was 5′-(FAM)-TGGGAAGACCTGCAGTGCTTGCAGT-(TAMRA)-3′. They were designed according to GenBankTM accession numbers 12346–12354 (19Kiss I. Deak F. Holloway Jr., R.G. Delius H. Mebust K.A. Frimberger E. Argraves W.S. Tsonis P.A. Winterbottom N. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8126-8134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The forward and reverse primers for α1 type X collagen were 5′-AGTGCTGTCATTGATCTCATGGA-3′ and 5′-TCAGAGGAATAGAGACCATTGGATT-3′, respectively. The internal probe of Col X cDNA was 5′-(FAM)- TCAAGTGTGGCTCCAGATGCCAAA-(TAMRA)-3′. They were designed according to GenBankTM accession numberM13496 (20LuValle P. Ninomiya Y. Rosenblum N.D. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18378-18385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of mRNAs of CMP and type X collagen was performed by real time quantitative RT-PCR with a PerkinElmer ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System, as described previously (28Rajpurohit R. Mansfield K. Ohyama K. Ewert D. Shapiro I.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). RT-PCR reaction was performed with AmpliTAQ Gold polymerase (PerkinElmer) with 20 ng of total RNA for each reaction. The 18 S RNA was amplified at the same time and used as an internal control. The cycle threshold (Ct) values for 18 S RNA and that of samples were measured and calculated by computer software (PerkinElmer). Relative transcript levels were calculated as x = 2−ΔΔCt, in which ΔΔCt = ΔE − ΔC, and ΔE =Ctexp − Ct18 s; ΔC = Ctctl − Ct18 s. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. and analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls test. Statistical significance is considered at p < 0.05. In some cases, Student's t test was also used when indicated. To determine whether p38 MAPK activity correlates with chondrocyte hypertrophy, we examined the basal level of p38 MAPK activity in both prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the basal p38 MAPK activity in hypertrophic chondrocytes was at least 10-fold higher than that of prehypertrophic cells (prehypertrophic, 1 ± 0.11; hypertrophic, 11.2 ± 0.37, n = 3,p < 0.01, t test). Therefore, p38 MAPK activity was elevated in hypertrophic chondrocytes, thus correlating with the differentiation state of chondrocytes. The difference of p38 MAPK activity between prehypertrophic and hypertrophic cells was not due to the difference of the expression levels of p38 MAPK protein, because there was no significant difference between the p38 protein levels from these two populations of cells, as assessed by Western blot analysis of p38 MAPK (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether PTH, which suppressed hypertrophy of chondrocytes (9Chung U.I. Lanske B. Lee K.C. Li E. Kronenberg H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13030-13035Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), had an effect on the kinase activity of p38 MAPK, hypertrophic chondrocytes were treated with PTH (1–34) for various time periods or with various dosages (Fig. 1 B). An inhibition of p38 MAPK by 100 nm PTH was observed at 10 min of treatment, and the inhibition lasted until 60 min when the kinase recovered to the basal level (Fig. 1, B and C). Dose response study of PTH indicated that both 1 and 100 nm PTH treatment of chondrocytes for 10 min inhibited p38 MAPK significantly, but 0.01 nm PTH did not (Fig. 1, B and C). To further confirm the inhibitory effect of PTH on p38 MAPK activity, tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was determined during the time course of PTH treatment. Because p38 MAPK activation requires phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrorine residues in the molecule, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK reflects the extent of kinase activation (17Zhen X. Uryu K. Wang H.Y. Friedman E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 D, tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was decreased after 10 min of PTH treatment and returned to the basal level after 60 min. This was in agreement with the time course of the PTH inhibition of p38 MAPK activity in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Thus, PTH inhibited p38 MAPK activity in hypertrophic chondrocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, treatment of hypertrophic chondrocytes with PTH had no significant effect on the activity of JNK, another major stress-activated MAPK (Fig.2). To determine whether inhibition of p38 MAPK by PTH was mediated by the PKC or PKA pathway, hypertrophic chondrocytes were incubated with specific inhibitors of PKC or PKA pathways. As shown in Fig. 3, inhibition of PKC by calphostin C, a selective PKC inhibitor, did not alter basal p38 activity (Fig.3 A, compare Cal.C with Control). However, calphostin C completely abolished PTH-mediated inhibition of p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 3 A, compare Cal.C+ PTH with PTH). This suggested that PKC was required for PTH-induced inhibition of p38 MAPK activity. In contrast, treatment of cells with either H-89, a selective PKA inhibitor (Fig. 3 B, compare H-89+ PTH with PTH), or cell permeable cAMP, an activator of PKA (Fig. 3 A, comparecAMP+ PTH with PTH), had no effect on the inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by PTH. This indicated that the PKA pathway was not involved in the inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by PTH. To test whether the inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by PTH involved Bcl-2, a recently identified component of the PTH pathway regulating chondrocyte differentiation (11Amling M. Neff L. Tanaka S. Inoue D. Kuida K. Weir E. Philbrick W.M. Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), the protein levels of Bcl-2 in hypertrophic chondrocytes were determined by Western blot analysis. PTH treatment at 100 nm stimulated Bcl-2 protein expression, whereas treatment with 100 ng/ml thyroxine, a chondrocyte differentiation inducer (21Ballock R.T. Reddi A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), did not alter the Bcl-2 protein level (Fig. 4 A). Thus, PTH specifically stimulated the Bcl-2 protein level in hypertrophic chondrocytes. To determine whether the inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by PTH led to the up-regulation of Bcl-2, hypertrophic chondrocytes were treated with 100 nm PTH; 10 μm SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 kinase activity; or a combination of both PTH and SB203580. The up-regulation of Bcl-2 by PTH (Fig. 4 B,PTH) can be mimicked by the inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 (Fig. 4 B, SB203580). In addition, a similar extent of the increase of Bcl-2 level was observed when cells were treated with both SB203580 and PTH (Fig. 4 B,SB+ PTH). These data suggested that inhibition of p38 MAPK was involved in PTH-regulated Bcl-2 expression. Although it is known that SB203580 at 10 μm, the concentration used in this study, inhibits activity of p38 MAPK but not that of JNK or ERK (22Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), it has been reported recently that SB203580 at the 5–10 μm range could inhibit interleukin-2-induced PKB (Akt) activation in CT6 cells (18Lali F.V. Hunt A.E. Turner S.J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7395-7402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To determine whether SB203580 also inhibited PKB activation in hypertrophic chondrocytes, hypertrophic chondrocytes were incubated with SB203580 at various concentrations, and kinase activities of both p38 MAPK and PKB were determined. As shown in Fig.5, SB203580 inhibited p38 MAPK in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, no significant inhibition of PKB activity was observed in these SB203580-treated cells. This result was verified by an in vitro assay, in which lysates of hypertrophic chondrocytes were incubated with SB203580 for 5 min, followed by determination of PKB activity. No significant inhibitory effects of SB203580 on PKB activity was observed (Control, 3207 ± 72; 1 μm SB203580, 2984 ± 124; 10 μm SB203580, 3023 ± 97; arbitrary units,n = 3). Thus, the optimal concentration of SB 203580 for specific inhibition of p38 MAPK may depend on cell types. In hypertrophic chondrocytes, 10 μm SB 203580 inhibited p38 MAPK activity but not PKB activity. To determine the downstream effects of PTH regulation of chondrocyte hypertrophy, we quantified the levels of mRNA of type X collagen, a marker of hypertrophic chondrocytes (2Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9504-9509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gibson G.J. Flint M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and that of CMP/matrilin-1, a marker of prehypertrophic chondrocytes (1Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Real time quantitative RT-PCR indicated that α1 type X mRNA was significantly decreased after 1 day of treatment of hypertrophic chondrocytes with 100 nm PTH, with maximal inhibition achieved after 3 days (Fig. 6). Thus, PTH inhibited chondrocyte hypertrophy. In contrast, PTH induced a significant increase of CMP mRNA after 1 day of treatment (2.6 ± 0.21-fold), and after 2 days of treatment (1.7 ± 0.1-fold) (Fig. 6). This suggested that PTH converted hypertrophic chondrocytes to the prehypertrophic phenotype, of which CMP was the marker. This change of CMP mRNA level, however, was transient. After 3 days of treatment with PTH, the CMP mRNA level returned to the basal level (Fig. 6). To determine whether p38 MAPK is involved in PTH-regulated chondrocyte differentiation by differentially altering the levels of type X collagen and CMP, we incubated hypertrophic chondrocytes with 100 nm PTH in the absence or presence of 10 μm SB203580 for 1 day. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 significantly inhibited the level of α1 type X mRNA (Fig.7), mimicking the effect of PTH treatment. In addition, treatment with both PTH and SB203580 showed a similar extent of inhibition of α1 type X mRNA as that of treatment with SB203580 alone (Fig. 7). These data suggested that inhibition of p38 MAPK activity was involved in the inhibition of α1 type X mRNA by PTH. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by SB203580 stimulated the CMP mRNA level to a similar extent as treatment with both PTH and SB together (Fig. 8 A). Treatment with PTH alone also stimulated the CMP mRNA level but to a lesser degree (Fig. 8 A). This suggested that inhibition of p38 MAPK could be achieved by PTH and some unknown elements, which led to up-regulation of the CMP mRNA level. In agreement with the mRNA data, a parallel increase of CMP protein level was observed by the same treatment (Fig. 8 B, CMP). In contrast, although the level of link protein, a protein expressed throughout chondrocyte differentiation process, was up-regulated by PTH, this stimulatory effect was not achieved by either SB treatment alone or SB and PTH treatment together (Fig. 8 B, LP). This indicated that other signaling mechanism that did not involve p38 MAPK might contribute to the PTH stimulation of LP expression. Furthermore, the up-regulation of CMP by PTH, SB, or PTH and SB treatment together (Fig. 8, A and B, CMP), as well as the down-regulation of type X collagen by these treatment (Fig. 7), corresponded to the inhibition of p38 MAPK activity during these treatment (Fig. 8 C). This further supported the conclusion that the inhibition of p38 MAPK activity was responsible for both up-regulation of CMP and down-regulation of type X collagen by PTH. The endochondral ossification process, which consists of chondrocyte proliferation, maturation, hypertrophy, and apoptosis, requires precise regulation of these differentiation events. It has become clear in recent years that a major regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy is the PTH/PTHrP signaling pathway (7Karaplis A.C. Luz A. Glowacki J. Bronson R.T. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Kronenberg H.M. Mulligan R.C. Genes Dev. 1984; 8: 277-289Crossref Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 8Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Henderson J.E. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1611-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 9Chung U.I. Lanske B. Lee K.C. Li E. Kronenberg H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13030-13035Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, very little is known about the intracellular molecules that transduce PTH/PTHrP signals to regulate chondrocyte hypertrophy. In this study, we present the first evidence that inhibition of chondrocyte hypertrophy by PTH is mediated by an inhibition of p38 MAPK activity. We propose a model in which p38 MAPK is a central link in the PTH/PTHrP signaling pathway to regulate chondrocyte hypertrophy by connecting PKC in the upstream and Bcl-2 in the downstream (Fig.9). The PTH-p38 MAPK pathway prevents precocious chondrocyte hypertrophy by simultaneously inhibiting type X collagen, a marker of hypertrophic chondrocytes, and stimulating CMP, a marker of prehypertrophic chondrocytes. It has been shown previously that PTH and PTHrP, which bind to a common PTH/PTHrP receptor (4Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar), employ at least two pathways for transducing signals, i.e. activation of PKA via Gs-coupled mechanism, or activation of PKC via a Gq-coupled mechanism (10Abou-Samra A.B. Jueppner H. Westerberg D. Potts Jr., J.T. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, both PKA and PKC have been reported to regulate the p38 MAPK pathway, and the specificity of regulation seems to vary depending on cell types (17Zhen X. Uryu K. Wang H.Y. Friedman E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that it is the PKC pathway that is responsible for transducing PTH signals to inhibit p38 MAPK activity in hypertrophic chondrocytes. PKC has also been implicated in regulating chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells (25Yang M.S. Chang S.H. Sonn J.K. Lee Y.S. Kang S.S. Park T.K. Chun J.S. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 266-271PubMed Google Scholar). Our data provide evidence that p38 MAPK maybe a downstream signaling molecule in PKC-regulated chondrocyte differentiation. We have also shown that inhibition of p38 MAPK activity is responsible for transducing PTH signals to prevent chondrocyte hypertrophy. The activity of p38 is elevated more than 10-fold in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Treatment with PTH inhibits such elevation, thereby preventing hypertrophy. This inhibition is specific, because PTH has no effect on the activities of JNK, another major stress-activated MAPK. Both p38 and JNK exist in chondrocytes, and they are activated by interleukin-1 and TNF-α, which may lead to chondrocyte apoptosis and cartilage degradation (26Geng Y. Valbracht J. Lotz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We have shown here that inhibition of p38 MAPK alone is sufficient to prevent chondrocyte terminal differentiation to hypertrophy. Inhibition of p38 MAPK, even in the absence of PTH signaling, causes downstream effects including up-regulation of Bcl-2 and CMP and down-regulation of type X collagen. This suggests that p38 may play a role not only in transmitting the PTH signals but also in the general control of chondrocyte hypertrophy. Our study also connects the PTH-p38 MAPK pathway to the regulation of Bcl-2 level in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Previous transgenic experiments have shown that Bcl-2 is a component of the PTH signaling pathway (11Amling M. Neff L. Tanaka S. Inoue D. Kuida K. Weir E. Philbrick W.M. Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We show here that the Bcl-2 level is regulated by the p38 MAPK activity. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptosis molecule that maintains cellular calcium homeostasis (27He H. Lam M. McCormick T.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 28Rajpurohit R. Mansfield K. Ohyama K. Ewert D. Shapiro I.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that chondrocyte calcium metabolism regulates its hypertrophic phenotype (29Bonen D.K. Schmid T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Wu Q. Chen Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and that chondrocyte hypertrophy is closely associated with apoptosis (31Gibson G. Lin D.L. Roque M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, it was not known how chondrocyte hypertrophy is related to apoptosis and calcium metabolism. Our finding that p38 MAPK regulates both Bcl-2 and chondrocyte hypertrophy through PTH signaling may reconcile all of these findings. It is interesting to note that the PTH-p38 MAPK pathway not only inhibits the hypertrophic marker type X collagen but also stimulates the prehypertrophic marker CMP. This indicates that PTH prevents chondrocyte terminal differentiation not only by inhibiting hypertrophy but also by actively converting a hypertrophic phenotype to a prehypertrophic one. This is consistent with the finding that hypertrophic chondrocytes can be converted into prehypertrophic chondrocytes (1Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Zerega B. Cermelli S. Bianco P. Cancedda R. Cancedda F.D. J. Bone Miner.

Biol. 1995; 172: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, this reversion is transient, as evidenced by the temporal stimulation of CMP in hypertrophic cells by PTH. A possible explanation for this phenomenon may be the desensitization of PTH/PTHrP receptors, which is common for G protein-coupled receptors upon prolonged exposure to ligands (33Hausdorff W.P.

Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2650-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Receptor desensitization could be due to phosphorylation of the receptors induced by agonist and mediated by PKA, PKC, or other G protein-coupled receptor kinases (34Mitchell J. Goltzman D.

For example, it has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of PTH/PTHrP receptors by prolonged PTH incubation desensitizes the receptors, probably via a G protein receptor kinase (34Mitchell J. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2650-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, in PTHrp overexpression transgenic mice, endochondral ossisfication is delayed but eventually occurred (6Schipani E. Lanske B. Hunzelman J. Luz A. Kovacs C.S. Lee K. Pirro A. Kronenberg H.M. Juppner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13689-13694Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that one way to overcome such transient nature of retro-differentiation is to consistently inhibit the downstream p38 MAPK activity. In summary, our study presents an important intracellular pathway for PTH signaling in hypertrophic chondrocytes. This pathway links extracellular PTH/PTHrP signals to intracellular regulatory molecules, including PKC, p38 MAPK, and Bcl-2, and ultimately to the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation and synthesis of extracellular matrix molecules such as type X collagen and CMP. The elucidation of this pathway may have strong implications for our understandings of skeletal development, which is potently regulated by PTH/PTHrP.

In this process vWF serves as a molecular bridge that links collagen exposed by the damaged vessel wall to glycoprotein Ib located on the platelet surface. Collagens that act as binding sites for vWF include types I and III in perivascular connective tissue and type VI in the subendothelial matrix (3Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev.

The A3 domain (residues 920–1111) contains the major binding site for collagen types I and III (6Lankhof H. van Hoeij M. Schiphorst M.E. Bracke M. Wu Y.P. IJsseldijk M.J. Vink T. de Groot P.G.

These data show that a monomeric A3 domain contains a fully active collagen-binding site, the only requirement for tight binding to collagen being the presence of multiple A3 domains within one vWF multimer.Integrin I-type domains are homologous to vWF A-type domains (10Colombatti A.

I domains of integrin α-chains α1, α2, α10, and α11 all possess collagen-binding sites. A crystal structure of the α2-I domain reveals binding of a collagen-like peptide to a groove in the surface of the “top” face of the domain (12Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (824) Google Scholar). This groove contains a so-called metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) (13Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar,14Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), which engages a glutamate residue of collagen.The location of the collagen-binding site in the vWF-A3 domain is not known. Crystal structures of A3 do not display a collagen-binding groove in the top face, instead, the surface of A3 is rather smooth (15Huizinga E.G. Van der Plas R.M. Kroon J. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Structure. 1997; 5: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bienkowska J. Cruz M.A. Atiemo A. Handin R.I. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25162-25167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the MIDAS motif is partly conserved, binding of A3 to collagen does not require a metal ion (17Pietu G. Fressinaud E. Girma J.P. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Rothschild C. Meyer D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1987; 109: 637-646PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bockenstedt P.L. McDonagh J. Handin R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and no metal ion is observed in crystal structures of A3. Moreover, point mutations in the MIDAS motif of A3 do not disrupt collagen binding (8Van der Plas R.M. Gomes L. Marquart J.A. Vink T. Meijers J.C.M. de Groot Ph. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. Thromb.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies of other residues in the top face of A3 have yielded conflicting results. Cruz et al. (19Cruz M.A. Bienkowska J. Mato A. Liddington R. Handin R.I. Blood Supplement I. 1997; 90 (.a Abstract): 23Google Scholar) reported in abstract form that amino acid substitutions D1069R, R1074D, R1090D, and E1092R resulted in a 50% reduction in binding of monomeric A3 to collagen. Van der Plas et al. (8Van der Plas R.M. Gomes L. Marquart J.A. Vink T. Meijers J.C.M. de Groot Ph. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), however, observed normal collagen binding of fully processed multimeric vWF containing mutations D1069R, D1069A, or R1074A. In the same study, mutations V1040A/V1042A, D1046A, and D1066A also displayed normal collagen binding, suggesting that the collagen-binding site of vWF-A3 is not located in its top face.The crystallographic study presented here was conducted to provide new clues on the location of the collagen-binding site of the vWF-A3 domain. We determined the structure of the A3 domain in complex with a Fab fragment of monoclonal antibody RU5, which inhibits binding of vWF to collagen. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues located in the epitope region show that the collagen-binding site is located distant from the top face of A3.DISCUSSIONThe current study was aimed at locating the collagen-binding site of the vWF-A3 domain. For this purpose we solved the crystal structure of A3 in complex with a Fab fragment of RU5 that inhibits collagen binding. The structure of the complex shows that RU5 binds to residues within A3 sequences 962–966, 981–997, and 1022–1026. These residues are located in α-helix 2 and in loops α1β2, β3α2, and α3β4 at the bottom of one of the side faces of the A3 domain (see Fig. 3). Comparison of structures of A3 shows that RU5 binding does not induce long range conformational changes. This excludes a mechanism in which RU5-induced conformational changes inhibit collagen binding. It seems likely, therefore, that RU5 inhibits collagen binding by steric hindrance, which implies that the collagen-binding site is located at or close to the RU5 epitope.To confirm the location of the collagen-binding site, we constructed five charged-to-alanine mutations of residues located in or close to the RU5 epitope. The multimer distribution of these mutants was similar to that of wild-type vWF. Therefore, observed differences in collagen binding are not caused by the known dependence of collagen binding on vWF multimer size (7Fischer B.E. Kramer G. Mitterer A. Grillberger L. Reiter M. Mundt W. Dorner F. Eibl J. Thromb. Res. 1996; 84: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All five mutants bound normally to RU5, which shows that none of the mutated residues plays a dominant role in the A3·RU5 interaction and, more importantly, that the conformation of A3 in the neighborhood of the epitope and the collagen-binding site is not disturbed.Mutation H1023A abolished collagen binding almost completely, residual binding being similar to that observed for ΔA3-vWF, a deletion mutant that lacks the entire A3 domain. Therefore, His1023 plays a central role in A3-mediated collagen binding. His1023 is located in loop α3β4 and lies at the edge between the “front” face of the domain, formed by helices α2 and α3 and strand β3, and the bottom face, which is composed of several loops and contains the N and C termini (Fig. 7). A small reduction of collagen binding was observed for mutants R963A and R1016A located in the bottom and front face of the domain, respectively.Interestingly, His1023 and flanking residues display a large variety of conformations among eight models of A3 (Figs. 4 and7). In some A3 structures His1023 protrudes prominently from the surface of the domain, which may be a favorable position for interaction with collagen. Multiple conformations are also observed for loop β3α2. Like His1023, loop β3α2 is located at the edge between the front and bottom faces of A3. Because we did not mutate residues in loop β3α2, its involvement in collagen binding remains to be established. The observed flexibility of His1023 suggests that collagen binding may involve an induced-fit mechanism in which significant conformational changes occur in loop α3β4 upon binding of A3 to collagen.The amino acid sequence of collagen that is recognized by vWF-A3 has not yet been identified. We hypothesized previously that negatively charged residues in A3 could interact with basic residues on collagen (15Huizinga E.G. Van der Plas R.M. Kroon J. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Structure. 1997; 5: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues now implicated in collagen binding are positively charged. Therefore, interaction of A3 with negatively charged residues on collagen appears more likely.In contrast to binding sites of other collagen binding domains, like the α1 and α2-I domains and the A domain ofStaphylococcus aureus adhesin (12Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 38Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Owens R.T. Carson M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24906-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the collagen-binding region of A3 does not have a groove or trench that could accommodate a collagen triple helix. The front face of the domain, harboring Arg1016, is rather flat. The bottom face, which contains Arg963 is less smooth, but no groove is present. Docking of a collagen triple helix on the A3 domain is not straightforward. In particular, it is not obvious how His1023, Arg963, and Arg1016 could simultaneously contact a triple helix in an extended conformation. To define the collagen-binding site more precisely, characterization of additional mutants will be necessary.Previously, the collagen-binding site of A3 was proposed to be located at its top face (15Huizinga E.G. Van der Plas R.M. Kroon J. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Structure. 1997; 5: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cruz M.A. Bienkowska J. Mato A. Liddington R. Handin R.I. Blood Supplement I. 1997; 90 (.a Abstract): 23Google Scholar) similar to the homologous I domains of integrins α1β1 and α2β1 (12Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C.

Point mutations introduced in the top face of an A3 monomer (19Cruz M.A. Bienkowska J. Mato A. Liddington R. Handin R.I. Blood Supplement I. 1997; 90 (.a Abstract): 23Google Scholar) and in multimeric vWF (8Van der Plas R.M. Gomes L. Marquart J.A. Vink T. Meijers J.C.M. de Groot Ph. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) gave conflicting results. Our results now show conclusively that the collagen-binding site is located close to the bottom face and not in the top face of A3.Although our results rule out a role for the top face of the A3 domain in collagen binding, this side of the molecule may still be engaged in other interactions, such as binding of the A1 domain. Interaction between A1 and A3 has been suggested to play a role in activation of the A1 domain for binding to platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (42Obert B. Houllier A. Meyer D. Girma J.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interesting in this respect are the buried and solvent-exposed conformation observed for residue Phe939, which is located close to the vestigial MIDAS motif in the top face of the domain (Fig.4 B). Solvent exposure of Phe939 has been proposed to stabilize the buried Asp934 of the vestigial MIDAS motif in the absence of a bound metal ion (16Bienkowska J. Cruz M.A. Atiemo A. Handin R.I. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25162-25167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our observation of a buried conformation shows that exposure of Phe939 is not critical for structural stability. The two conformations of Phe939 may, however, be relevant for the putative interaction between A1 and A3, because the shape and hydrophobicity of the upper surface of A3 differs significantly between the solvent-exposed and buried conformation.In conclusion, the collagen-binding site of vWF-A3 is distinctly different from collagen-binding sites of I domains of integrins α1β1 and α2β1. vWF-A3 residues involved in collagen binding are located close to the bottom face of the domain. His1023 is essential for collagen binding, whereas Arg963 and Arg1016play ancillary roles. Multiple conformations observed for His1023 and adjacent residues suggest that binding of A3 to collagen involves an induced-fit mechanism. Platelet adhesion to damaged vessel walls is the first step in the formation of an occluding platelet plug, which leads to the arrest of bleeding during normal hemostasis. Platelet adhesion can also cause thrombotic complications such as the occlusion of atherosclerotic arteries (1Vischer U.M. De Moerloose P. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1999; 30: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The multimeric glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWF)1 plays an essential role in platelet adhesion under conditions of high shear stress (2Ruggeri Z.M. Ware J. FASEB.

In this process vWF serves as a molecular bridge that links collagen exposed by the damaged vessel wall to glycoprotein Ib located on the platelet surface. Collagens that act as binding sites for vWF include types I and III in perivascular connective tissue and type VI in the subendothelial matrix (3Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev.

Mature vWF consists of a 2050-residue monomer that contains multiple copies of so-called A, B, C, and D type domains and one CK (cystine knot) domain arranged in the order D′-D3-A1-A2-A3-D4-B1-B2-B3-C1-C2-CK (1Vischer U.M.

The location of the collagen-binding site in the vWF-A3 domain is not known. Crystal structures of A3 do not display a collagen-binding groove in the top face, instead, the surface of A3 is rather smooth (15Huizinga E.G. Van der Plas R.M. Kroon J. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Structure. 1997; 5: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bienkowska J. Cruz M.A. Atiemo A. Handin R.I. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25162-25167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the MIDAS motif is partly conserved, binding of A3 to collagen does not require a metal ion (17Pietu G. Fressinaud E. Girma J.P. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Rothschild C. Meyer D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1987; 109: 637-646PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bockenstedt P.L. McDonagh J. Handin R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and no metal ion is observed in crystal structures of A3. Moreover, point mutations in the MIDAS motif of A3 do not disrupt collagen binding (8Van der Plas R.M. Gomes L. Marquart J.A. Vink T. Meijers J.C.M. de Groot Ph. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. Thromb.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies of other residues in the top face of A3 have yielded conflicting results. Cruz et al. (19Cruz M.A. Bienkowska J. Mato A. Liddington R. Handin R.I. Blood Supplement I. 1997; 90 (.a Abstract): 23Google Scholar) reported in abstract form that amino acid substitutions D1069R, R1074D, R1090D, and E1092R resulted in a 50% reduction in binding of monomeric A3 to collagen. Van der Plas et al. (8Van der Plas R.M. Gomes L. Marquart J.A. Vink T. Meijers J.C.M. de Groot Ph. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), however, observed normal collagen binding of fully processed multimeric vWF containing mutations D1069R, D1069A, or R1074A. In the same study, mutations V1040A/V1042A, D1046A, and D1066A also displayed normal collagen binding, suggesting that the collagen-binding site of vWF-A3 is not located in its top face. The crystallographic study presented here was conducted to provide new clues on the location of the collagen-binding site of the vWF-A3 domain. We determined the structure of the A3 domain in complex with a Fab fragment of monoclonal antibody RU5, which inhibits binding of vWF to collagen. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues located in the epitope region show that the collagen-binding site is located distant from the top face of A3. DISCUSSIONThe current study was aimed at locating the collagen-binding site of the vWF-A3 domain. For this purpose we solved the crystal structure of A3 in complex with a Fab fragment of RU5 that inhibits collagen binding. The structure of the complex shows that RU5 binds to residues within A3 sequences 962–966, 981–997, and 1022–1026. These residues are located in α-helix 2 and in loops α1β2, β3α2, and α3β4 at the bottom of one of the side faces of the A3 domain (see Fig. 3). Comparison of structures of A3 shows that RU5 binding does not induce long range conformational changes. This excludes a mechanism in which RU5-induced conformational changes inhibit collagen binding. It seems likely, therefore, that RU5 inhibits collagen binding by steric hindrance, which implies that the collagen-binding site is located at or close to the RU5 epitope.To confirm the location of the collagen-binding site, we constructed five charged-to-alanine mutations of residues located in or close to the RU5 epitope. The multimer distribution of these mutants was similar to that of wild-type vWF. Therefore, observed differences in collagen binding are not caused by the known dependence of collagen binding on vWF multimer size (7Fischer B.E. Kramer G. Mitterer A. Grillberger L. Reiter M. Mundt W. Dorner F. Eibl J. Thromb. Res. 1996; 84: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All five mutants bound normally to RU5, which shows that none of the mutated residues plays a dominant role in the A3·RU5 interaction and, more importantly, that the conformation of A3 in the neighborhood of the epitope and the collagen-binding site is not disturbed.Mutation H1023A abolished collagen binding almost completely, residual binding being similar to that observed for ΔA3-vWF, a deletion mutant that lacks the entire A3 domain. Therefore, His1023 plays a central role in A3-mediated collagen binding. His1023 is located in loop α3β4 and lies at the edge between the “front” face of the domain, formed by helices α2 and α3 and strand β3, and the bottom face, which is composed of several loops and contains the N and C termini (Fig. 7). A small reduction of collagen binding was observed for mutants R963A and R1016A located in the bottom and front face of the domain, respectively.Interestingly, His1023 and flanking residues display a large variety of conformations among eight models of A3 (Figs. 4 and7). In some A3 structures His1023 protrudes prominently from the surface of the domain, which may be a favorable position for interaction with collagen. Multiple conformations are also observed for loop β3α2. Like His1023, loop β3α2 is located at the edge between the front and bottom faces of A3. Because we did not mutate residues in loop β3α2, its involvement in collagen binding remains to be established. The observed flexibility of His1023 suggests that collagen binding may involve an induced-fit mechanism in which significant conformational changes occur in loop α3β4 upon binding of A3 to collagen.The amino acid sequence of collagen that is recognized by vWF-A3 has not yet been identified. We hypothesized previously that negatively charged residues in A3 could interact with basic residues on collagen (15Huizinga E.G. Van der Plas R.M. Kroon J. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Structure. 1997; 5: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues now implicated in collagen binding are positively charged. Therefore, interaction of A3 with negatively charged residues on collagen appears more likely.In contrast to binding sites of other collagen binding domains, like the α1 and α2-I domains and the A domain ofStaphylococcus aureus adhesin (12Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 38Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Owens R.T. Carson M.

The front face of the domain, harboring Arg1016, is rather flat. The bottom face, which contains Arg963 is less smooth, but no groove is present. Docking of a collagen triple helix on the A3 domain is not straightforward. In particular, it is not obvious how His1023, Arg963, and Arg1016 could simultaneously contact a triple helix in an extended conformation. To define the collagen-binding site more precisely, characterization of additional mutants will be necessary.Previously, the collagen-binding site of A3 was proposed to be located at its top face (15Huizinga E.G.

Our results now show conclusively that the collagen-binding site is located close to the bottom face and not in the top face of A3.Although our results rule out a role for the top face of the A3 domain in collagen binding, this side of the molecule may still be engaged in other interactions, such as binding of the A1 domain. Interaction between A1 and A3 has been suggested to play a role in activation of the A1 domain for binding to platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (42Obert B. Houllier A. Meyer D. Girma J.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interesting in this respect are the buried and solvent-exposed conformation observed for residue Phe939, which is located close to the vestigial MIDAS motif in the top face of the domain (Fig.4 B). Solvent exposure of Phe939 has been proposed to stabilize the buried Asp934 of the vestigial MIDAS motif in the absence of a bound metal ion (16Bienkowska J. Cruz M.A. Atiemo A. Handin R.I. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25162-25167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our observation of a buried conformation shows that exposure of Phe939 is not critical for structural stability. The two conformations of Phe939 may, however, be relevant for the putative interaction between A1 and A3, because the shape and hydrophobicity of the upper surface of A3 differs significantly between the solvent-exposed and buried conformation.In conclusion, the collagen-binding site of vWF-A3 is distinctly different from collagen-binding sites of I domains of integrins α1β1 and α2β1. vWF-A3 residues involved in collagen binding are located close to the bottom face of the domain. His1023 is essential for collagen binding, whereas Arg963 and Arg1016play ancillary roles. Multiple conformations observed for His1023 and adjacent residues suggest that binding of A3 to collagen involves an induced-fit mechanism. The current study was aimed at locating the collagen-binding site of the vWF-A3 domain.

Tethering factors have been identified in other transport steps, suggesting conservation of this basic underlying process (25Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 26Barr F.A. Nakamura N. Warren G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3258-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 27Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Once docked, however, vesicle fusion is no longer dependent on Rab, but requires the SNARE proteins. Thus, stability of docked vesicles may represent a number of distinct molecular states: from molecular interactions that merely hold the two membranes in close proximity to those needed to trigger bilayer fusion. Studies on synaptic vesicles have shown that docked vesicles will undock about once every 2 min, a rate that is faster than spontaneous fusion (28Murthy V.N. Stevens C.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, reversibility of vesicle tethering and docking provides a time constraint on subsequent steps. Little is known on the mechanism of Rab localization to a specific membrane compartment. We have recently isolated a Rab-interacting protein called prenylated Rabacceptor or PRA1 (29Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PRA1 interacts with both Rab and VAMP2 but not as a stable trimeric complex. In fact, binding of PRA1 to VAMP2 can be displaced by Rab3A, suggesting that PRA1 participates in the sequential assembly of protein by associating and dissociating from the Rab and VAMP2. Moreover, PRA1 inhibits the removal of Rab from the membrane by GDI (30Hutt D.M. Da-Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the recycling of Rab depends on the opposing action of PRA1 and GDI, with PRA1 favoring membrane retention and GDI favoring solubilization in the cytosol. The existence of multiple isoforms seems to be a common theme in proteins involved in the various vesicle transport steps. Multiple isoforms of VAMP and syntaxin supports the concept that distinct members mediate specific membrane trafficking steps (31Advani R.J. Bae H.R. Bock J.B. Chao D.S. Doung Y.C. Prekeris R.

We describe here the isolation of a second PRA isoform that shares many similarities to PRA1 including overall physical properties, tissue distribution, and broad binding specificity toward the Rab GTPases. However, it differs from PRA1 in its subcellular localization. Whereas PRA1 was localized predominantly in the Golgi complex, PRA2 was found in the ER compartment. Moreover, we showed that the localization signal resides in the COOH-terminal region of the proteins. A EST data base search using the conserved domain of the rat PRA1 resulted in a number of similar clones, most notably that with accession numbers AW519501 and AA051031. The rat PRA2 was subcloned into a vector containing the hemagglutinin (HA) tag by ligation between the StuI and XbaI sites. PRA2 was PCR-amplified from a rat brain cDNA library using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TAAGGCCTATGGACGTGAACCTCG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATTACTCCCTCGCTTTGCTGA-3′. The resulting PCR fragment was sequenced. A 32P-labeled full-length PRA2 probe was prepared using random hexamer labeling (Life Technologies). A multiple tissue blot (CLONTECH) containing poly(A)+-selected mRNA of various rat tissues was hybridized with 1 × 106 cpm/ml of32P-labeled PRA2 in 10 ml of hybridization solution (5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, 50%formamide, and 0.4%SDS) at 42 °C overnight. PRA2 was subcloned into the yeast two-hybrid prey vector, pGAD424X using PRA2.E, 5′-CGAGAATTCTTACTCCCTGGCTTTGCTGAT-3′ and PRA2.X2, 5′-GCCTCGAGTTACTCCCTSGCTTTGCTGA-3′. The VAMP1, VAMP2, and VAMP3 bait plasmids were described previously (29Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged PRA2 was subcloned into pQE10 (Qiagen) between theBamHI and the HindIII sites after PCR amplification using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GCGGATCCTATGTACCCATACGATG-3′ and 5′-GACAAGCTTACTCCCTGGCTTTGC-3′. The 6xHis-tagged PRA2 was purified the same way as the PRA1 using Ni-NTA resin as described (29Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The Rab GTPases were also subcloned into the 6xHis-tagged pQE41 (Qiagen) between the BamHI and SphI sites. Rab1A was PCR-amplified using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TGTGGATCCATGTCCAGCATGAATCCCGAA-3′ and 5′-CTAGGCATGCTTAGCAGCAGCCTCCACCTG-3′. The 6xHis-tagged Rab1A fragment was ligated into pYES2 (Invitrogen) between the EcoRI andSphI sites. The plasmid was then transformed into the yeast INVSc1 strain with Li acetate (34Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). To purify the 6xHis-tagged Rab1A, the transformed yeast was grown to saturation in 500 ml of Ura dropout medium. The cells were harvested at 3,000 × g for 5 min, transferred to 1 liter of YPG (containing 2%galactose and 1%raffinose instead of glucose), and grown at 30 °C for 8 h. The Rab1A was then purified from the yeast as described previously for Rab3A (30Hutt D.M. Da-Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), except that phosphate-buffered saline was used instead of Tris-HCl and the proteins were eluted from the resin with 50 mm EDTA. The purified Rab3A and Rab1A were cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB) as described by the manufacturer. Various domains of HA-tagged wild-type PRA1 and PRA2 were PCR amplified using pIRES/HA-PRA1 and pIRES/HA-PRA2 as DNA templates. Two rounds of PCR were used to generate the chimeras. The first round of PCR generated the individual PRA1 or PRA2 fragments, which served as templates for the second round to create the different chimeras. The PCR products were digested with ClaI and EcoRI and subcloned into the same restriction sites of the mammalian expression vector pIRESpuro (CLONTECH). The carboxyl regions of both PRA1 and PRA2 were PCR-amplified using the Bluescript KSII(−)/HA-PRA1 and KSII(−)/HA-PRA2 as DNA templates. PCR products were gel purified and subcloned into the GFP-containing vector, pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) as XhoI andBamHI fragments such that the GFP was fused to the amino terminus of the PCR product. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the expected mutations. The binding of Rab1A and Rab3A to PRA1 and PRA2, in the presence of GDPβS or GTPγS was done using purified yeast or bacterially expressed proteins in a pull-down assay. A typical binding assay contained 20 μl of 50%bead slurry cross-linked with Rab1A or Rab3A at 2 pmol/μl. This was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10, 15, and 20 pmol of recombinant PRA1 or PRA2 in a total volume of 250 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm KCl, 0.005%Triton X-100, 10%glycerol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 250 μm GDPβS or GTPγS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Controls were also done using Sepharose beads with no cross-linked Rab. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm KCl, and 0.005%Triton X-100, 10%glycerol). Denaturing loading buffer was added to the beads and proteins were subjected to Western immunoblot analysis. PRA1 and PRA2 were detected using anti-HA antibodies (Roche). All plasmid constructs were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). CHO cells were seeded at 1 × 105 on 12-mm diameter coverslips overnight and transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA in 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE. The cells were fixed after 36–48 h in 4%paraformaldehyde (EM Sciences) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30–60 min and washed with 100 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated with blocking buffer (1%bovine serum albumin, 2%normal goat serum, and 0.4%saponin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30–60 min at room temperature. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with the cells for 1 to 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed with 100 mmglycine in phosphate-buffered saline and Alexa 488- or Alexa 568-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used to detect the bound primary antibodies. Rabbit anti-calnexin (Stressgen) and anti-mannosidase-II (kindly provided by Dr. M. G. Farquhar) were used together with the monoclonal anti-HA in certain cases. Coverlips were mounted with Slow Fade anti-quench solution (Molecular Probes) and confocal laser microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC-1024MP) was used to capture the images. The cells were fixed and stained to visualize the chimeric constructs; however, live cells were imaged for the GFP fusions. For subcellular fractionation, 100-mm plates of CHO cells were transfected with pIRESpuro/HA-PRA2 in LipofectAMINE. After 24–48 h, the cells were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (TBS) supplemented with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The crude homogenate was spun at 5,000 × g for 10 min to remove the cell debris, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h to yield the high speed cytosolic and intracellular membrane fractions. To further characterize the membrane-associated PRA2, the high speed membrane fractions were resuspended in 0.1 ml of TBS and extracted with 20 volumes of 0.1m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, at 4 °C for 30–60 min. The membranes were then collected by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h (4 °C). For Triton X-114 extraction, the resuspended membranes were solubilized in 1%Triton X-114 at 4 °C for 30–60 min, and induced to phase partition at 37 °C for 10–15 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The resulting detergent phase was back extracted three times with 10 volumes of ice-cold TBS at 4 °C for 10 min, and phase partitioned as before. The resulting supernatants were pooled and precipitated with 10%trichloroacetic acid. Proteins involved in vesicle transport often exist as multiple isoforms with each mediating specific membrane trafficking steps. A BLAST search of the mouse and rat EST data bases with the conserved region of rat PRA1 revealed a number of overlapping clones. Merging the sequences from two of the longest mouse clones (accession numbers AW519501 and AA051031) revealed an open reading frame of 564 nucleotides. Oligonucleotides spanning the initiation and termination codons were used to PCR amplify rat and mouse brain cDNA libraries. Both gave a PCR product of the expected size, and were subsequently subcloned into a HA-tagged Bluescript vector for DNA sequence analysis. The open reading frame of the rat PRA2 contained 188 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 21.5 kDa. As with PRA1, PRA2 also contained two extensive hydrophobic domains, of 36 and 35 residues spanning amino acids 47 to 82 and 101 to 135, respectively. Comparison of the two rat PRA sequences revealed an overall amino acid identity of 26%and a similarity of 35%(Fig. 1). The most conserved domain was located at residues 35 to 47, immediately amino-terminal to the first hydrophobic segment of the two proteins. One notable difference between the two proteins was the length of the amino- and COOH-terminal domains flanking the two hydrophobic segments. PRA2 has a shorter amino-terminal domain of 46 residues compared with 77 in PRA1, but a longer COOH-terminal domain of 53 residues compared with 21 in PRA1. The PRA2 COOH-terminal domain has a cluster of basic residues in contrast to PRA1 which has a number of acidic residues. Moreover, this COOH-terminal domain of PRA2 has a weak coiled-coil conformation, which might play a role in protein-protein interaction. A search of the data base revealed that PRA2 is identical to the rat JWA (accession number AAF60354) and highly similar to the human JM4 (accession number NP 009144) clones. Northern blot analysis showed that PRA2 was encoded by a single 1.5–1.8-kilobase transcript and broadly expressed in most tissues (Fig. 2). The message was most abundant in the heart and brain. This expression pattern was similar to that of PRA1 (29Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with one exception: there was a lower level of expression of PRA2 in the testis whereas PRA1 was highly expressed. This broad expression pattern suggests that PRA2 might also be involved in membrane trafficking events in all tissues. In both PRA1 and PRA2, the testis transcript appeared larger than that from other tissues. The reason for this remained unknown. Since PRA1 can bind both GDP- and GTP-bound Rab, we examined the interaction of PRA2 with the Rab GTPases. In the yeast two-hybrid system, PRA2 showed a positive β-galactosidase reaction when tested against the wild-type and GTPase mutant Rab1A and Rab3A (data not shown). As with PRA1, the interaction was abolished when the double Cys prenylation motif of Rab was deleted, suggesting that prenylation is required for interaction. To confirm this interaction, we performed an in vitro binding assay using recombinant Rab1A and Rab3A purified as a 6xHis-tagged fusion protein from the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and covalently linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose. The proteins were pre-loaded with GDP, GTP, or maintained in the nucleotide-free state (in the presence of EDTA). Increasing amounts of recombinant HA-tagged PRA1 or PRA2 was added to the beads at 4 °C with the bound proteins recovered and analyzed by Western immunoblot. As shown in Fig.3 A, PRA2 was recovered with the immobilized Rab1A and Rab3A but not with the control Sepahrose beads. There was a slight increase in the amount of PRA2 recovered with immobilized Rab3A compared with Rab1A. PRA2 showed a slightly higher affinity for GTP-bound Rab but was clearly recovered with the GDP-bound as well as guanine nucleotide-free state of both Rab GTPases. Under the same conditions, PRA1 also showed a slight preference for Rab3A over Rab1A (Fig. 3 B). There was also a slightly higher affinity for the GTP-bound Rab followed by guanine nucleotide-free and GDP-bound forms. Thus, we conclude that both PRA1 and PRA2 can interact with, at least, Rab1A and Rab3A in the guanine nucleotide-bound and free states. To determine the cellular distribution, we subcloned the HA-tagged PRA2 into the bicistronic expression vector pIRESpuro, transfected it into CHO cells, and performed a subcellular fractionation analysis. As with PRA1, the protein fractionated with both the high speed supernatant and membranes (Fig. 4). When the membrane fraction was extracted with alkaline carbonate buffer, some of the membrane-bound protein appeared in the soluble fraction similar to the behavior of PRA1 and suggested peripheral association with the membrane. However, the membrane-bound PRA2 partitioned exclusively with the detergent phase when subjected to Triton X-114 extraction and phase separation. In contrast, a significant portion of the membrane-bound PRA1 remained with the aqueous phase in the Triton X-114 extraction. Thus, both PRA1 and PRA2 are highly hydrophobic proteins tightly associated with the membrane but may also appear in the cytosol. When transfected into CHO cells, PRA2 has a striking reticular staining pattern reminiscent of the ER (Fig.5 A). Indeed, there was extensive co-localization with calnexin, a known ER marker. We observed little, if any, co-localization with mannosidase II, a Golgi membrane marker. In contrast, PRA1 was found exclusively associated with the Golgi complex with extensive co-localization with mannosidase II (Fig.5, C and D). Thus, the two PRA isoforms are localized to distinct intracellular compartments with PRA2 restricted to the ER and PRA1 confined to the Golgi complex (30Hutt D.M. Da-Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This distinct intracellular localization implies that PRA1 and PRA2 may contain targeting signals that direct the protein to the appropriate intracellular compartment. It also implies that each PRA might only interact with a subset of Rab in the cell even though both are capable of binding multiple Rab isoforms in either the GDP- or GTP-bound state. To define the organelle-specific targeting signal, we constructed amino-terminal HA-tagged chimeras of PRA1 and PRA2, and determined their cellular localization in transfected CHO cells. Based on the structural features, we divided the two proteins into three separate domains: amino-terminal domain (Domain A), the two hydrophobic segments plus the intervening hydrophilic loop (Domain B), and the charged COOH-terminal domain (Domain C). Hybrid oligonucleotides spanning these domains were used to generate the chimeras by PCR using either HA-tagged PRA1 or PRA2 as the template. As shown in Fig.6, chimera 1A/2BC, for example, contained Domain A of PRA1 fused to Domains B and C of PRA2. Likewise, chimera 2A/1B/2C contained Domain A of PRA2 fused to Domain B of PRA1 followed by Domain C of PRA2, and so on. The various chimeras were subcloned into the pIRESpuro vector and sequenced to confirm the expected mutations. Two days after transfection, the CHO cells were stained with anti-HA and costained with either anti-mannosidase II or anti-calnexin to identify the Golgi and ER, respectively. As shown in Fig.7, the COOH-terminal domain of PRA2 targeted the chimera to the ER whether it contained only the amino-terminal Domain A of PRA1 (1A/2BC in Fig. 7 A and6 D), both Domains A and B of PRA1 (1AB/2C in Fig. 7,B and E), or only Domain B of PRA1 (2A/1B/2C in Fig. 7, C and F). Similarly, Domain C of PRA1 targeted the chimera to the Golgi complex whether it contained only the amino-terminal Domain A of PRA2 (2A/1BC in Fig. 7, G andJ), both Domains A and B of PRA2 (2AB/1C in Fig. 7,H and K), or only Domain B of PRA2 (1A/2B/1C in Fig. 7, I and L). Thus, we concluded that the COOH-terminal domain of PRA1 and PRA2 contained the localization signal that either targeted or caused the protein to be retained at the proper membrane compartment. The amino-terminal Domain A and the two hydrophobic segments in Domain B of the two proteins were interchangeable. For PRA1, its normal localization to the Golgi complex was not altered by the presence of either Domain A (2A/1BC) or Domain B (1A/2B/1C) of PRA2. Likewise, the normal position of PRA2 at the ER was not altered by the presence of either the amino-terminal Domain A (1A/2BC) or Domain B (2A/1B/2C) of PRA1.Figure 7Cellular localization of PRA1 and PRA2 chimeras. The transfected CHO were stained with anti-HA (panels A, C, E, G, I, and K) and with either calnexin (panels B, D, and F) or mannosidase II (panels H, J, and L). The cells were transfected with chimera 1A/2BC (panels A and B), 1AB/2C (panels C and D), 2A/1B/2C (panels Eand F), 2A/1BC (panels G and H), 2AB/1C (panels I and J), and 1A/2B/1C (panels K and L).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the COOH-terminal domain was indeed responsible for targeting the protein to the appropriate membrane compartment, we constructed chimeras containing the full-length or only Domain C of PRA1 and PRA2 fused to the carboxyl terminus of GFP. When transfected into CHO cells, the full-length PRA2 (Fig.8 B) and PRA1 (Fig.8 C) showed a bright fluorescent signal in the ER and Golgi complex, respectively. Thus, the full-length protein was able to direct a cytosolic GFP (Fig. 8 A) to a specific membrane organelle. Domain C of PRA2-(132–188) was able to partially target GFP to intracellular membranes where a distinctive punctate staining pattern throughout the cell was clearly evident (Fig. 8 D). However, membrane targeting by this domain was inefficient as a significant amount of florescent signal remained in the cytosol. Since this domain of PRA2 contained 57 amino acids, we performed a limited deletion to further define the boundaries of the localization signal. Further deletion of 17 residues in GFP-PRA2-(148–188) or 33 residues in GFP-PRA2-(164–188) completely abrogated this punctate staining pattern (Fig. 8, F and H). Thus, the minimal localization signal must either be contained within the first 17 amino acids immediately COOH-terminal to the second hydrophobic segment or required domains in addition to that contained within Domain C. In contrast to PRA2, GFP fusion of Domain C of PRA1-(162–185), which contained only 24 amino acids, cannot target GFP to intracellular membranes (Fig.8 E). Neither can a further addition of 5 hydrophobic residues in GFP-PRA1-(157–185). When combined with the previous observation, these results suggest that the COOH-terminal domain of PRA2 can partially target proteins to the membrane and that transport of PRA1 to the Golgi complex required additional domains such as ones that can functionally interact with Rab or VAMP2. One striking feature of the COOH-terminal domain of the PRA isoforms is their overall charge. PRA1 contained a number of acidic residues whereas the first 15 amino acids of Domain C in PRA2 contained numerous basic residues. The carboxyl terminus of PRA1 contained an additional glutamate immediately after the consensus DXE motif (residues 176–178) involved in the exit of membrane proteins from the ER (35Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 36Nishimura N. Bannykh S. Slabough S. Matteson J. Altschuler Y. Hahn K. Balch W.E. J. Biol.

This is due in part to the fact that adhesion to extracellular matrix is required for progression of cells through the cell cycle by regulating cyclin D1 and cyclin E-Cdk2 (2Fang F. Orend G.

It is sometimes difficult to keep smooth muscle cells in culture without serum despite the presence of extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors. This observation suggests that serum contains unidentified survival factors. In a previous study, we showed that α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI),1α1-antichymotrypsin (α1ACT), and α2-macroglobulin (α2M) are necessary for cell spreading and adhesion in fibrin gels (10Ikari Y. Fujikawa K. Yee K.O. Schwartz S.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 12799-12805Google Scholar). These proteinase inhibitors protect degradation of extracellular matrix proteins by cell-derived proteinases. Thus, the plasma proteinase inhibitors are essential to ensure appropriate cell-matrix interactions. Analysis of the cells that detach in the absence of proteinase inhibitors showed a similarity to apoptotic cells induced by serum depletion. Based on these results, we hypothesized that the proteinase inhibitors function as critical survival factors in vascular smooth muscle cells. Cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (HNB18E6E7) were originally derived from the aorta of a newborn infant (2-day-old) autopsy (11Liaw L. Skinner M.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Cheresh D.A.

After washing with PBS, the cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, at a concentration of 50,000 cells/50 μl. A 96-well culture plate was previously coated with either fibronectin (10 μg/ml) or vitronectin (10 μg/ml) at room temperature for 1 h. The cell suspensions (50 μl) were plated on the 96-well culture plate. 50 μl of each sample were overlaid. Final concentration of the samples was 5% calf serum, PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml), α1PI (0.125 mg/ml), α1ACT (0.125 mg/ml), and α2M (0.125 mg/ml) in DMEM with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Attached cells were counted using phase contrast microscopy. Fibronectin, vitronectin, α1PI, α1ACT, and α2M were purchased from CalBiochem. PDGF-BB was from Life Technologies, Inc. The experiments were repeated three times. After observing cell morphology, 25 μl of 25% SDS was added to the wells and shaken for 1 h. The samples were run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blotted with polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibody (R790), a kind gift provided by Dr. William G. Carter (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute, Seattle, WA), at 1:10,000 dilution, and the antigen was visualized with Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After collecting floating cells, attached cells were exposed to 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA. Trypsin was inactivated by soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). All the attached and detached cell populations were combined to determine the proportion of dead cells. Trypan blue (Life Technologies, Inc.) was mixed with cells (1:1), and trypan blue exclusion by living cells was scored using phase contrast microscopy. TUNEL staining was performed using thein situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche Molecular Biochemicals cat. No. 1 684 795). The nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst at 5 μg/ml. α1PI was inactivated according to Johnson and Travis (13Johnson D. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem... 1979; 254: 4022-4026Google Scholar); 0.1 mg of human α1PI (CalBiochem) in 40 μl of 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.8 was mixed with 10 μl of 80 mm N-chlorosuccinimide (Sigma) and incubated overnight. The excess of the reagent was removed by dialysis. The remaining antitrypsin activity was less than 1 × 10−4 of the original activity. α2M (CalBiochem) was inactivated by treating with 0.2 m methylamine (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 for 6 h at room temperature. After dialysis, the remaining activity was less than 1 × 10−4. A 96-well culture plate was previously coated with fibronectin. Cell suspension of 50,000 cells/94.5 μl were plated. Each sample was overlaid; 0.5 μl of 20 mm z-VAD in Me2SO plus 5 μl of PBS, 0.5 μl of Me2SO plus 5 μl of 0.125 mg/ml α2M in PBS, or 0.5 μl of Me2SO plus 5 μl of PBS. Final concentration of z-VAD was 0.1 mm and that of α2M was 6.25 μg/ml. Cell morphology and trypan blue exclusion were performed as noted above. Activity of caspase was determined using fluorescent caspase-specific substrate PhiPhiLux-G1D2 (Oncoimmunin) of which the main peptide sequence is GDEVDGI. Human vascular smooth muscle cells were cultured on a plate previously coated with fibronectin for 24 h with α2M at 1.7 × 10−7m, without α2M, with z-VAD at 1 × 10−4m or with staurosporin at 1 × 10−6m. Cells were collected, then washed in PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 50 μl of 10 μm substrate solution. Flow cytometry analysis was performed at λex = 505 nm and λem = 530 nm. All experiments were repeated three times. Analysis of variance test was performed using SAS software version 6 in order to compare mean and variance. Human vascular smooth muscle cells (HNB18E6E7) were plated in DMEM medium containing either calf serum, PDGF-BB, α1PI, α1ACT, or α2M on 96-well culture plate previously coated with either fibronectin or vitronectin. PDGF-BB induces cell division of HNB18E6E7 cells as shown by increased thymidine incorporation (data not shown). Attached cells were counted using a phase contrast microscope. At 1 h, cell attachment on the surface was similar. However, at 24 h, the numbers of attached cells were significantly different (Fig.1 A). Fig. 1 B shows photographs at 24 h, when cells had detached and looked round upon serum depletion or in the presence of PDGF-BB. In contrast; with serum, α1PI, α1ACT, or α2M; cells remained attached and spread. A number of cells with calf serum was about 10% more than α1PI, α1ACT, or α2M, probably because the growth factors in serum supported proliferation. To determine whether the endogenous cellular proteinases disrupted the cell matrix, we examined the integrity of fibronectin. Specifically, fibronectin was extracted by 5% SDS, and then Western blot analysis was performed. Fibronectin was intact with serum, α1PI, α1ACT, or α2M; however, it was degraded with PDGF or no serum (Fig.1 C). Therefore, the morphology of the cells depended on the integrity of adhesion molecules. To determine how many cells were dead, we collected all the detached and attached cells and then counted the total number of dead cells by trypan blue exclusion test (Fig.2 A). Dead cell numbers were significantly higher with no serum or PDGF alone than with serum or proteinase inhibitors. Next, we confirmed apoptosis using TUNEL staining although TUNEL detects apoptosis only of attached cells (Fig.2 B). TUNEL positivity was significantly higher with no serum or PDGF than other groups. These data suggest that proteinase inhibitors prevent degradation of matrix, which supports cell attachment and may result in cell survival. Next, we quantified the survival effect of the proteinase inhibitors. α1PI, α1ACT, and α2M induce cell survival in a dose-dependent manner by the trypan blue exclusion test (Fig. 3 A). In this assay, 50% survival was achieved at 4.4 × 10−8m in α2M, at 3.3 × 10−7m in α1PI, and at 4.2 × 10−7m in α1ACT. Thus, α2M has a 7.6 times higher ability than α1PI and 9.6 times higher than α1ACT. We next removed both α1PI and α2M from human serum by immunoprecipitation. We did not have an appropriate antibody against α1ACT and thus could not deplete it. Ninety-five percent of the proteinase inhibitory activity was lost by the simultaneous removal of both proteins. The remaining 5% activity was probably due to the presence of α1ACT. The immunoprecipitated serum lost ∼95% of survival activity, assessed by trypan blue (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, we tried an admixture of three proteins at normal serum level. Survival rate with the admixture was not statistically different from that with serum in this assay (Fig. 3 B). Chemical inactivation was performed on α1PI and α2M. α1PI was inactivated with N-chlorosuccinimide. α2M was inactivated with methylamine. Both α1PI and α2M lost their survival effect (Fig.3 C). These results indicate that the ability of cell survival is attributable to proteinase inhibitory activity. We compared the proteinase inhibitors with a caspase inhibitor as survival factors. Cells attached on a plastic surface previously coated with fibronectin at 24 h with α2M (Fig.4 A); however, cells detached with no serum (Fig. 4 B) or with z-VAD (Fig. 4 C). The level of attached cells was significantly higher with α2M than other groups (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, with z-VAD, the cells are alive (assessed by trypan blue exclusion) although many cells have detached (Fig. 4E). z-VAD had no effect on attachment although detached cells survived with z-VAD. Next, we determined caspase activity using caspase-specific fluorescent substrate, PhiPhiLux-G1D2. With α2M, caspase activity was as low as with z-VAD (Fig. 5). However, without α2M, caspase activity was significantly high, similar to that with staurosporin. This suggests that the proteinase inhibitor not only supports attachment but also prevents activation of caspases. The data suggest a novel mechanism for cell survival induced by plasma proteinase inhibitors. Cell survival is dependent on the ability of proteinase inhibitor to protect adhesion matrix. If the proteinase inhibitors are not present, the matrix is degraded by proteinases, and the cells cannot maintain attachment. It is well documented that extracellular matrix and integrin interactions generate intracellular signals that lead to caspase activation (14Boudreau N. Sympson C.J. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Science.. 1995; 267: 891-893Google Scholar, 15McGill G. Shimamura A. Bates R.C. Savage R.E. Fisher D.E. J. Cell Biol... 1997; 138: 901-911Google Scholar, 16Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol... 1999; 71: 435-478Google Scholar). However, combinations of adhesion molecules and growth factors alone are often insufficient to keep cells in culture alive without serum. Serum therefore, has been assumed to include unidentified survival factor(s). We have demonstrated that the critical antiapoptotic factors in serum are α1PI, α1ACT, and α2M. We also show that the mechanism of survival involves proteinase inhibitors, protecting the extracellular matrix from being degraded by cell-derived proteinase(s). Cell migration is required during development, in tissue repair and in wound healing. Degradation of the extracellular matrix is a prerequisite for cell migration into the three-dimensional matrix. As part of this homeostatic process, cells produce proteinases, including matrix metalloproteinases (17Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 21491-21494Google Scholar) and/or serine proteinases. Careful regulation of proteolytic activity is required, as too much degradation will induce detachment that may result in cell death. In many cases, matrix proteinase activity is immediately neutralized. In addition to plasma proteinase inhibitors, many proteinase inhibitors such as tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPS) have activity against specific cell-derived proteinases (18Blavier L. Henriet P. Imren S. Declerck Y.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci... 1999; 878: 108-119Google Scholar). Because a broad spectrum of proteases have apoptotic activity, it is reasonable to assume that many proteinase inhibitors are potentially antiapoptotic factors, acting via a mechanism similar to what we have shown here. There is some controversy over whether TIMPs are proapoptotic or antiapoptotic. TIMP-3 induces apoptosis (19Baker A.H. George S.J. Zaltsman A.B. Murphy G. Newby A.C. Br. J. Cancer.. 1999; 79: 1347-1355Google Scholar, 20Baker A.H. Zaltsman A.B. George S.J. Newby A.C. J. Clin. Invest... 1998; 101: 1478-1487Google Scholar, 21Ahonen M. Baker A.H. Kahari V.M.

Chem. 2000; Google Scholar). Alexander et al. (24Alexander C.M. Howard E.W. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol... 1996; 135: 1669-1677Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of TIMP-1 prevents apoptosis of epithelial cells from stromelysin-1 transgenic mice. Several other studies have shown antiapoptotic effects of TIMP-1 (25Guedez L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Wolff L. Wang J. Fukushima P. Mansoor A. Stetler-Stevenson M. J. Clin. Invest... 1998; 102: 2002-2010Google Scholar, 26Guedez L. Courtemanch L. Stetler-Stevenson M. Blood.. 1998; 92: 1342-1349Google Scholar) and TIMP-2 (27Valente P. Fassina G. Melchiori A. Masiello L. Cilli M. Vacca A. Onisto M. Santi L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Albini A. Int. J. Cancer.. 1998; 75: 246-253Google Scholar). The role of proteinases is not limited to matrix degradation in vivo. For example, extracellular proteinases can directly modify intracellular signals via proteinase-activated receptors (28Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol... 1998; 274: C1429-52Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between proteinases and proteinase inhibitors may influence a cells response to its environment in several ways. Compared with the abundance of albumin and globulin, proteinase inhibitors are the third most prevalent group of plasma proteins. In our assay, neither albumin nor globulin demonstrated any antiapoptotic effect whereas α2M, a very nonspecific protease inhibitor, was very cytoprotective. α2M is an ancient protein that is found in all vertebrates and in non-vertebrates such as eels and crabs (29Starkey P.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci... 1983; 421: 112-118Google Scholar). There is speculation that α2M is a carrier of transforming growth factor-β and other cytokines (30Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Garcia M. J. Cell. Physiol... 1993; 155: 595-605Google Scholar) or that it functions as an agonist of α2M receptors (31Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest... 1996; 97: 1193-1203Google Scholar). No α2M genetic deficiency has been found in our species despite extensive screening of human plasma (32Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1983; 52: 655-709Google Scholar). Furthermore, α2M knock-out mice have no phenotype (33Umans L. Serneels L. Overbergh L. Lorent K. Van-Leuven F. Van-den-Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 19778-19785Google Scholar). α1PI is a universal inhibitor of serine proteinases, which when diminished or mutated causes pulmonary emphysema and liver fibrosis. Physiologically, α1PI is considered to be an elastase inhibitor (32Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1983; 52: 655-709Google Scholar). α1ACT is a chymotrypsin type serine proteinase inhibitor. α1ACT is recognized as an acute phase protein. Serum concentrations of α1ACT increase rapidly and dramatically after a variety of events including surgery, burn injury, inflammatory bowel disease, and some types of cancer (32Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1983; 52: 655-709Google Scholar). This probably indicates that an increase in α1ACT supports the survival of resident cells in areas of inflammation. Although the actual roles of the plasma proteinase inhibitors are not completely clarified, our data show a novel biological activity of these proteinase inhibitors. One obvious question is what proteinase(s) does the smooth muscle cell produce? Based on the specificity of proteinase inhibitors, chymotrypsin type serine proteinases are candidates. We observed that this cell line produced chymotryptic activity when co-cultured with a chymogenic substrate (data not shown). Additional experiments using degenerate PCR primers and screening of a large gene expression array also identified a trypsin-like protease (manuscript in preparation). In conclusion, we have shown a novel anti-apoptotic activity of plasma proteinase inhibitors. Because of the high concentration of α1PI and α2M, the proteinase inhibitors may function as the major antiapoptotic proteins present in serum. The proteinase inhibitors prevent extracellular matrix from degradation by cell-derived proteinase(s). This novel activity may suggest that the proteinase inhibitors could play a role in vascular disease such as atherosclerosis or aortic aneurysm.

The S-layer glycoprotein of the Gram-positive, thermophilic bacterium Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus L420-91T, a member of the Bacillus/Clostridium group, is composed of identical repeats ofd-rhamnose and 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose units (5Kosma P. Neuninger C. Christian R. Schulz G. Messner P. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The principal architecture of S-layer glycoproteins resembles that of the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria (6Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Neuninger C. Messner P. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both glycoconjugates exhibit a tripartite structural organization, where usually conserved core regions connect a glycan chain, composed of repeating units, either with the S-layer polypeptide or the lipid A of LPS.

Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2091-2098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, GDP-d-mannose is converted to GDP-d-rhamnose in two reaction steps (Fig.1). The first step is the dehydration of GDP-d-mannose (GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, Gmd), which leads to the unstable intermediate GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose (14Bulet P. Hoflack B. Porchet M.

This keto-derivative is further converted to the final product GDP-d-rhamnose by the action of GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase (Rmd).

FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Two further residues, Thr133 and Glu135, complete the catalytic residues in the active center of E. coli Gmd. Another set of conserved residues, found near the N terminus in the Rossman-fold (30Wierenga R.K. Maeyer M.C.H. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1346-1357Crossref Scopus (463) Google Scholar), is responsible for the binding of NAD(P)+. Other residues important for substrate or cofactor binding are spread throughout the protein sequence. For the second reaction step, the reduction of the hexulose, inP. aeruginosa an ORF directly upstream of the gmdgene has been proposed to code for the reductase Rmd. The corresponding ORF has been deleted, which results in mutants that lack A-band LPS, which is composed exclusively of d-rhamnose residues (31Rocchetta H.L. Pacan J.C. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 19: 1419-1434Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). So far, no functional studies of the enzyme have been performed. This second step in GDP-d-rhamnose biosynthesis seems to be a perfect target for enzyme inhibition to prevent the synthesis ofd-rhamnose-containing LPS structures in pathogenic bacteria. Such an approach would lead to a promising therapeutic alternative to the careless use of antibiotics. Crystallographic analysis of the Rmd protein would help to corroborate the functional results and could lead to the design of enzyme inhibitors via molecular modeling. In this report we characterize for the first time the biosynthetic reactions involved in the conversion of GDP-d-mannose to GDP-d-rhamnose. GDP-d-mannose, NAD+, NADH, NADPH, and dithiothreitol were obtained from Sigma. Glutathione (reduced form) was from Merck, and NADP+ was obtained from Gerbu Biotechnik GmbH (Gailberg, Germany).

For enzyme overexpression E. coli BL21-SI (F− ompB hsdSB(r B m B−) gal dcm endA1 proUp::T7RNAP::malQ-lacZ Tets) (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used. Media were supplemented with ampicillin, kanamycin, or chloramphenicol at concentrations of 100, 50, and 34 μg/ml, respectively, when required. Cells were grown at 30 or 37 °C, with or without agitation. Nucleotide-activated sugars were analyzed on a CarboPac PA-1 column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) using the method of Palmieri et al. (34Palmieri M.J. Berry G.T. Player D.A. Rogers S. Segal S. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 184: 388-393Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Monosaccharides were analyzed on a CarboPac PA-1 as described previously (6Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Neuninger C. Messner P. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the original method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using slight modifications. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). BLAST (basic logic alignment search tool; Ref. 37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar) were used to analyze nucleotide and protein sequences. For protein family analysis, the Prosite data base was used (39Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). All standard DNA recombinant procedures were performed according to the methods described by Sambrook et al. (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or as recommended by the corresponding manufacturer. PCR was carried out using a PCR Sprint thermocycler (Hybaid, Ashford, UK). DNA sequencing was performed either by MWG BIOTECH (Ebersberg, Germany) or AGOWA (Berlin, Germany). A genomic library of A. thermoaerophilus strain L420-91T was prepared by cloning size fractionated, partially Sau3A-digested DNA that was partially filled in with dGTP and dATP, into the phage λ vector λGEM-12. This vector was cut with XhoI and partially filled in with dTTP and dCTP. The presence of clones containing the gmd sequence was confirmed by PCR using the primer pair (5′-TTTCCTGCTGATTTTTGC-3′ and 5′-CAATATCCGAATCTTCCTACG-3′) and phage lysate as template. A small, PCR-positive subpool was screened by plaque-lifting using a 32P-labeled gmd PCR fragment as probe. A clone (λBK1) containing gmd and about 10 kilobases of downstream DNA was converted into a plasmid suitable for sequencing by in vivo recombination in yeast (41Ma H. Kunes S. Schatz P.J. Botstein D. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 58: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In brief, the vector pPGA1851, 2G. Adam, unpublished data. which contains 450 base pairs of DNA from the left arm of phage λ and 390 base pairs of its right arm, is linearized in between and cotransformed into yeast with a crude preparation of the respective phage λ using a simple lithium transformation protocol (42Gietz D. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). About 10% of the yeast transformants contain the recombination product formed in vivo. The resulting (broad host range) plasmid pλBK1, containing the insert of the λ clone, was recovered from yeast, introduced into E. coli by electroporation, and used subsequently for sequencing. Oligonucleotide primers for the amplification of DNA fragments containing either the gmd orrmd gene were designed with attB1 or attB2 sites for the insertion into the GATEWAY donor vector pDONR201 (Life Technologies, Inc.) by homologous recombination. Primers with the following sequences were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc.: GMDA1 (forward), 5′-attB1-GCGAGAATCTCTACTTCCAAGGAATGAAAAAAGCTTTAATTCC-3′; GMDA2 (reverse), 5′-attB2-CTGCAACTCCAGTGATTAGG-3′; RMDA1 (forward), 5′-attB1-GCGAGAATCTCTACTTCCAAGGAATGAGAGCCCTAATCACTGG-3′; and RMDA2 (reverse), 5′-attB2-CCTCTGTATCTCCAAATTGC-3′. attB1 and attB2 are the minimal 25-base pair sequences required for efficient homologous recombination. The PCR products were cloned into pDONR201, and the resulting plasmids gGMD1 and gRMD1 were used to transfer the gene sequences into pDEST15 (GST fusion) or pDEST17 (His fusion) via homologous recombination. The corresponding plasmids gGMD2 (GST fusion), gGMD3 (His fusion) and gRMD3 (His fusion) were used for overexpression of the fusion proteins inE. coli BL21-SI. Cells carrying gGMD3 were grown at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 in 1 liter of culture volume, and expression was performed for 3 h. Cells harboring the GST fusion plasmid gGMD2 were grown at 30 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 in 1.4-liter culture volume, and expression was carried out overnight. A 1.4-liter culture harboring gRMD2 was grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.5, and expression was done for 4 h. Production of the fusion proteins was induced by the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.3 m. The cells were disrupted on ice by ultrasonication, cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 31,000 × g, and membrane fractions were removed by ultracentrifugation at 331,000 × g. Purifications using HiTrap Chelating and GSTrap columns were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. A HiPrep Desalting column was used for buffer exchange. Anion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column was carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, using 1m KCl as eluent. Dithiothreitol (0.5 mm) was added to the buffers when using GSTrap, HiPrep Desalting, and MonoQ columns. Purification of histidine-tagged Gmd was performed with HiTrap Chelating, and imidazole was removed using a HiPrep Desalting column (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl). Glutathione S-transferase-tagged Gmd was purified using GSTrap and MonoQ (elution at 300 mm KCl) columns. The Rmd His-tagged fusion protein was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using HiTrap Chelating and MonoQ (elution at 330 mm KCl) columns. The proteins were stored at 4 °C or after stabilization with 50% glycerol at −20 °C. The purity of the enzymes was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (4% stacking gel and 12% separating gel). 20 nmol of GDP-d-mannose or GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose were used for enzyme assays. His-Gmd was removed by ultrafiltration after in situ preparation of GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose. The assay buffer contained 50 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) and 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were performed in 100 μl of reaction volume at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were analyzed by HPLC on a CarboPac PA-1 column. 20 μmol of GDP-d-mannose were converted quantitatively to GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose, as judged by HPLC analysis, using appropriate amounts of GST-Gmd in 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, 0.3 m KCl, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. The dehydratase was removed by ultrafiltration using Ultrafree-MC 10000 ultrafiltration cartridges. For the second reaction step Rmd and NADPH were added, and after complete conversion to GDP-d-rhamnose, NADP+ and NADPH were removed by HPLC. Ammonium acetate was removed by a desalting step using Sephadex G-10, and lyophilization resulted in pure GDP-d-rhamnose in 18.5% yield. No ultrafiltration step was performed when synthesizing GDP-d-rhamnose with GST-Gmd only. Additional enzyme was added after the first reaction step, but inactivation of the enzyme resulted in incomplete reduction of the keto-intermediate and the yield of pure GDP-d-rhamnose was only 2%. The lyophilized material of the first preparation (2.0 mg) was dissolved in 99.95% D2O (0.5 ml). The solution of the second sample (0.2 mg) contained 10 mg of NaCl, which was added for resolution enhancement. Spectra for both solutions (pD = ∼5) were recorded at 300 K at 300.13 MHz for1H, at 75.47 MHz for 13C, and 121.49 MHz for31P, with a Bruker AVANCE 300 spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm quadruple nuclear inverse probehead (QNP). External calibration was performed for 1H spectra with 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (δ = 0), for13C spectra using 1,4-dioxane (δ = 67.40), and for31P spectra with H3PO4 (δ = 0). Measurement of correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple bond correlation, heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation, and H,P-correlated spectra was performed with standard BRUKER software. The genes encoding enzymes for the biosynthesis of a nucleotide sugar precursor are usually clustered together within the corresponding gene cluster for the particular bacterial polysaccharide (43Reeves P.R. Compr. Biochem. 1994; 27: 271-314Google Scholar). An alignment of 18 Gmd and putative Gmd sequences found in the NCBI data base was carried out using MultAlin (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Within the amino acid sequence there are several highly conserved regions. One of these regions, GILFNHES, was found to be identical in 16 of 18 data base entries, and the seven-amino acid stretch GILFNHE was used for the design of the degenerate oligonucleotide probe 5′-GGI ATH YTI TTY AAY CAY GA-3′ (where I is inosine, H is A/C/T, and Y is C/T). This digoxigenin-labeled probe was used for Southern hybridization experiments to get highly specific signals with completely digested chromosomal DNA of A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T. Hybridization of EcoRI-digested DNA at 36.5 °C resulted in one specific band at 3 kilobases that was isolated and cloned into the plasmid pBCKS. The insert of the corresponding plasmid pRMD38 was sequenced and contained part of the gmd gene besides one hypothetical ORF (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequence GILFNHES is also part of the new gmd sequence. The downstream part of gmd was sequenced as described previously (44Kneidinger, B., Graninger, M., and Messner, P. (2001)BioTechniques, in pressGoogle Scholar) to yield further sequence information completing thegmd gene and part of a second gene, putatively coding for the reductase Rmd. Complete sequence of the second gene was obtained by sequencing of plasmid pλBK1 (Fig. 2), which is derived form a λGEM-12 clone. The d-rhamnose operon seems to consist only of the two ORFs coding for Gmd and Rmd, because there are no other ORFs on the upstream and downstream sequences, respectively. The protein sequence of Gmd from A. thermoaerophius L420-91T was aligned with 27 Gmd sequences obtained from data bases. These sequences include Gmd proteins from bacteria as well as from archaea and eukarya. The alignment showed a high level of overall identity in all sequences used. The highest homology to the Gmd sequence of A. thermoaerophius L420-91T was obtained with the following sequences: Caulobacter crescentus(GenBankTM accession number AAC38668), P. aeruginosa (AAG08828), and Aquifex aeolicus (D70393). Recently, the crystal structure of Gmd from E. coli was reported, and several conserved amino acid residues were proposed to be important for substrate and cofactor binding and catalysis (21Somoza J.R. Menon S. Schmidt H. Joseph-McCarthy D. Dessen A. Stahl M.L. Somers W.S. Sullivan F.X. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All these residues were found in Gmd of A. thermoaerophiusL420-91T except Thr133, which was replaced by Ser (Fig. 3). According to these results,gmd from A. thermoaerophius L420-91Tis unequivocally identified as the gene encoding the GDP-d-mannose 4,6-dehydratase. An NCBI BLAST search was performed using the newly determined protein sequence of the second open reading frame in this operon, which putatively codes for Rmd. Two highly homologous proteins were found in the data base, one Mycobacterium tuberculosis putative dehydrogenase (GenBankTM accession number C70840, 35% identity, 53% similarity) and a P. aeruginosa protein (AAG08839, 33% identity, 54% similarity) described as Rmd, without any functional characterization. Further comparison of Rmd fromA. thermoaerophius L420-91T with Gmd fromA. thermoaerophius L420-91T and E. coli showed considerable similarity (Fig. 3). Especially two important motifs GXXGXXG, the cofactor-binding Wierenga motif, and YXXXK are conserved. The catalytic residues Tyr and Lys are completed by a Ser residue to form the catalytic triade, which is, together with the Wierenga motif, a characteristic feature of the SDR protein family (19Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Because of the functional difference between Gmd and Rmd, some of the residues described to be important for binding of NADP+ and GDP-d-mannose in Gmd are not conserved (Fig. 3). Even one of the catalytic residues, Glu135 (Gmd of E. coli), is not conserved throughout the Rmd sequences. However, this residue is proposed to abstract a hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group at C-5 of the sugar (21Somoza J.R. Menon S. Schmidt H. Joseph-McCarthy D. Dessen A. Stahl M.L. Somers W.S. Sullivan F.X. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and Rmd functions by reducing the keto group at C-4. Because of the intrinsic instability of the GDP-d-mannose dehydratase, it was not possible to obtain sufficient active, native protein, even after only one purification step. His-Gmd was also partially inactivated during purification with the HiTrap Chelating column. However, GST-Gmd revealed higher stability. GST-Gmd was purified using GSTrap and MonoQ columns and proved to be stable at 4 °C and at −20 °C. GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase was expressed as a histidine-tagged fusion protein and purified using HiTrap Chelating and MonoQ columns. Rmd was stable at 4 °C and at −20 °C. His-Gmd, GST-Gmd, as well as histidine-tagged Rmd were used for the functional characterization of the GDP-d-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway. The molecular masses of the denatured proteins, determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, were in good agreement with the calculated molecular masses (His-Gmd, 40.1 kDa; GST-Gmd, 65.2 kDa; His-Rmd, 38.1 kDa; Fig. 4). GDP-d-mannose was converted quantitatively to GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose, as judged by anion exchange HPLC analysis (r t = 33.0 min; Fig. 5). His-Gmd required the addition of NADP+ as cofactor. NAD+ addition resulted in less than 10% conversion, and this was also observed when no cofactor was added. GST-Gmd converted the substrate without the addition of any cofactor. The integrity of GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose was investigated by chemical reduction of the keto group with NaBH4. The reduction products were analyzed by HPLC (data not shown). Two products were formed in a 1:2 ratio. The minor peak comigrated with GDP-d-rhamnose (r t = 26.3 min), when synthesized with Rmd (see below). The major peak showed a retention time of 26.7 min, being slower than GDP-d-rhamnose but faster than GDP-d-mannose (r t = 27.0 min). This product is supposed to be GDP-6-deoxy-d-talose. Because of the lack of an appropriate standard for nucleotide-activated 6-deoxytalose, no further proof of this assumption was possible. Attempts to isolate the intermediate product failed because of the instability of the d-lyxo product. GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose was decomposed to form GMP and GDP, as judged by HPLC analysis, even upon storage on ice and after desalting on a Sephadex G-10 column. Because of the instability of GDP-6-deoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose, this intermediate product had to be prepared in situ for the characterization of the second reaction step in the GDP-d-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway. GDP-d-mannose was converted quantitatively to the hexulose, and Gmd was removed from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration. A new product, migrating faster than GDP-d-mannose, as derived from HPLC analysis, appeared when the intermediate product was converted by the Rmd protein (Fig. 5). Under the app"

Here we generated a knock-in mouse model that carries N-terminal-shortened cardiac MyBP-C.

Although histological characterization of wild-type and mutant hearts did not reveal obvious differences in phenotype, left ventricular fibers from homozygous mutant mice exhibited an increased Ca2+ sensitivity of force development, particularly at lower Ca2+concentrations, whereas maximal active force levels remained unchanged. The results allow us to propose a model of how cMyBP-C may affect myosin-head mobility and to rationalize why N-terminal mutations of the protein in some cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy could lead to a hypercontractile state.

Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Three different isoforms of MyBP-C have been identified: skeletal (sMyBP-C), fast and slow, and a cardiac-specific variant (cMyBP-C, see Fig. 1 A), each of these being coded for by a distinct gene (4Weber F.E. Vaughan K.T. Okagaki T. Reinach F.C. Fischman D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Carrier L. Bonne G. Bahrend E., Yu, B. Richard P. Niel F.

Res. 1997; 80: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). All isoforms interact at the C terminus with the rod portion of myosin (e.g. Ref. 6Alyonycheva T.N. Mikawa T. Reinach F.C. Fischman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20866-20872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as well as with titin (e.g. Ref. 7Freiburg A. Gautel M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and thus help maintain an ordered thick-filament structure (reviewed in Ref. 3Winegrad S. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). MyBP-Cs are modular polypeptides that belong to the intracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Whereas the skeletal variants consist of 10 globular domains of the Ig-like or fibronectin-type-III-like fold (4Weber F.E. Vaughan K.T. Okagaki T. Reinach F.C. Fischman D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), cMyBP-C contains an additional N-terminal Ig module termed C0 (5Carrier L. Bonne G. Bahrend E., Yu, B. Richard P. Niel F. Hainque B. Cruaud C. Gary F. Labeit S. Bouhour J.B. Dubourg O. Desnos M. Hagege A.A. Trent R.J. Komajda M. Fiszman M. Schwartz K. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Between the Ig domains C1 and C2, MyBP-Cs also contain a stretch of about 100 residues, the MyBP-C motif (see Fig. 1 A), which in cardiac muscle can be phosphorylated at three sites by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (8Gautel M. Zuffardi O. Freiburg A. Labeit S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The MyBP-C motif was shown to bind to the S-2 segment of myosin, close to the lever arm domain of the myosin head (9Gruen M. Gautel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 933-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this interaction is dynamically regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the MyBP-C motif (10Gruen M. Prinz H. Gautel M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Moreover, the controlled interaction with the myosin hinge region appears to affect the contractile behavior of muscle fibers (11Kunst G. Kress K.R. Gruen M. Uttenweiler D. Gautel M. Fink R.H.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and thus, could represent a potential regulatory mechanism of contractility (12Winegrad S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 6-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These insights notwithstanding, direct evidence for a role of cMyBP-C in force regulation has been difficult to obtain. Uncovering the functions of cMyBP-C is interesting from a clinical point of view as the protein is involved in the pathophysiology of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC, Refs. 13Watkins H. Conner D. Thierfelder L. Jarcho J.A. MacRae C. McKenna W.J. Maron B.J. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 14Bonne G. Carrier L.

Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: R39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Mutations incMYBPC account for ∼15–20% of genetically defined FHC cases, but the cMyBP-C-linked types of FHC present as relatively benign phenotypes with mild hypertrophy at mid-life (16Niimura H. Bachinski L.L. Sangwatanaroj S. Watkins H. Chudley A.E. McKenna W. Kristinsson A. Roberts R. Sole M. Maron B.J. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J.

Hainque B. Bouhour J.B. Schwartz K. Komajda M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Most cMyBP-C lesions show C-terminal truncated polypeptides lacking either the myosin or myosin and titin binding sites, but some lesions are also caused by missense mutations occurring in more N-terminal regions of the protein (16Niimura H. Bachinski L.L. Sangwatanaroj S. Watkins H. Chudley A.E. McKenna W. Kristinsson A. Roberts R. Sole M. Maron B.J. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Genetical engineering approaches have been used to generate transgenic mice lacking variable numbers of C-terminal domains of cMyBP-C (18Yang Q. Sanbe A. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Klevitsky R.

These model systems have demonstrated the importance of the C terminus of cMyBP-C for a regular sarcomeric structure and normal contractility of the heart. In the present study we used knock-out/knock-in technology to generate mice (hereafter termed knock-in mice) with N-terminal deletion of a region of cMyBP-C comprising one Ig domain and a linker sequence next to the MyBP-C motif. The shortened cMyBP-C (see Fig. 1 A) thus has a domain structure similar to that of sMyBP-C. Notably, within the region affected by the knock-in, a missense mutation has been described for a family of FHC patients exhibiting a distinct phenotype (16Niimura H. Bachinski L.L. Sangwatanaroj S. Watkins H. Chudley A.E. McKenna W. Kristinsson A. Roberts R. Sole M. Maron B.J. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). We show that the cMyBP-C deletion variant is expressed in both homozygous and heterozygous mice at the protein level and is readily incorporated into the sarcomere. Animals carrying the deletion are viable, show no significant ultrastructural changes of the heart, and appear to have a normal life span. Mutated cMyBP-C could still be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but skinned muscle fibers from homozygous mutant hearts revealed a leftward shift in the force-pCa curve and a decreased slope of that curve. The increased Ca2+ sensitivity may result from decreased steric hindrance of myosin-head mobility caused by the expression of the shorter cMyBP-C. We discuss the possibility that the additional N-terminal Ig domain present in cardiac versus skeletal MyBP-C could be included by nature to aid force regulation at the cross-bridge level in the heart. Our findings also provide a starting point to explain the development of hypertrophied cardiac tissue in FHC cases with N-terminal mutations of cMyBP-C. A P1 clone containing the murine cardiac MYBP-C sequence was obtained from a mouse 129 P1 genomic library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). A 9.1-kb Eco RI fragment from the P1 clone was isolated and subcloned and found to contain the 5′-end of the gene from exon 1–20 (Fig. 1 B). A 1.7-kbStu I/Eco RV fragment (including exon 2) located upstream of exon 3 and a 5.3-kb NsiI/Eco RI fragment (including exon 7–20) located downstream of exon 6 were used as the 5′ and 3′ homology units. The targeting vector was constructed by standard recombinant techniques. A genomic fragment of the MYBP-C gene (1.3 kb) including exons 3–6 was deleted and replaced by a neomycin resistance gene (Fig. 1 B). The vector contained a herpes simplex thymidine kinase cassette for negative selection of single recombinant embryonic stem (ES) cell clones. Also, the vector included a uniqueCla I restriction site for linearization of the plasmid. Homologous recombination between targeting vector and cognate cMyBP-C locus deleted exons 3–6. Colony selection and target clone identification were done as described elsewhere (21Schmidt C. Bladt F. Goedecke S. Brinkmann V. Zschiesche W. Sharpe M. Gherardi E. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 373: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Targeting vector (20 μg) was introduced into 1.2 × 107 ES cells by electroporation. Genomic DNA was prepared as described (22Ramirez-Solis R. Rivera-Perez J. Wallace J.D. Wims M. Zheng H. Bradley A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Correct targeting of G418-resistant clones was analyzed by Southern blotting. Clones were subsequently tested by long PCR assay (Combi Pol/InViTek, Berlin-Buch). To check for the occurrence of new recognition sites on the amplificates, Southern blotting was employed. Correctly targeted clones were microinjected into C57/BL 6 blastocysts, which were implanted into pseudo-pregnant CB6 mice bred to produce heterozygous or homozygous mutant animals. MyBP-C mRNA was assessed by nucleotide sequence analysis of RT-PCR-amplified DNA fragments according to standard protocols. The following primer pairs were used: CF 198, GGCTGAGACGGAGCGGTCAGGCG; CR 558, GTCATCAGGGGCTCCCTGATGCTCTGCAGC; CF 198, GGCTGAGACGGAGCGGTCAGGCG; CR1134, CGAAGGTCTGTGACTCCGTGCTGG; CF3923, CAGGATGGCTCCCCAGAGATGGCT; and CR4195, GCTCCTACACAATGAGCCAGCCAG. Northern blotting of cardiac/skeletal-muscle RNA was performed as described previously (23Krämer J. Aguirre-Arteta A.M. Thiel C. Gross M. Dietz R. Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Excised hearts were rinsed in 4% paraformaldehyde and weighed, and cardiac tissue was examined for pathological alterations (24McKenna W.J. Stewart J.T. Nihoyannopoulos P. McGinty F. Davies M.J. Br. Heart J. 1990; 63: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Examined parameters included heart weight, left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size, and myocyte nuclear size (measured by outlining the nucleus in 150 cardiac cells cut in their long axis). Bundles of myofibrils prepared from left ventricle essentially as described (25Linke W.A. Rudy D.E. Centner T. Gautel M. Witt C. Labeit S. Gregorio C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) were examined under a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope. MyBP-C was visualized by using antibodies against the MyBP-C motif (25Linke W.A. Rudy D.E. Centner T. Gautel M. Witt C. Labeit S. Gregorio C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Freshly excised mouse hearts were perfused retrogradely through the aorta with 4 °C rigor buffer (mM: NaCl, 132; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; glucose, 7;N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 10; pH 7.0; EGTA, 5; leupeptin, 0.1; and 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM, Ref. 20McConnell B.K.

Invest. 1999; 104: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) for 2 min. Papillary muscles or trabeculae from left ventricle were dissected, tied to thin glass rods, and skinned overnight in ice-cold relaxing solution (mM: imidazole, 20; pH 6.8; ATP, 7.5; MgCl2, 10; NaN3, 1; EGTA, 4; leupeptin, 0.1; BDM, 20; total ionic strength, 130) containing 0.25–0.5% Triton X-100 (26Dohet C. Al-Hillawi E. Trayer I.P. Rüegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A relatively low buffer pH used in skinned fiber mechanical studies was reported to be beneficial for the functional preservation of the regulatory system (27Herzig J.W. Köhler G. Pfitzer G. Rüegg J.C. Wölffle G. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After washes with fresh relaxing buffer, fiber bundles 150–200 μm thin and 3–4 mm long were mounted isometrically between a position-controlled rigid post and a force transducer (AME AE 801, Horten Electronics, Norway) with nitroacetate glue (26Dohet C. Al-Hillawi E. Trayer I.P. Rüegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Sarcomere length was adjusted to 2.2 μm by laser diffractometry. After removal of BDM and addition of an ATP-regenerating system (creatine phosphate, 10 mm; creatine kinase, 150 units/ml) to the solution, fibers were activated by transfer from relaxing to activating buffer, in which EGTA was substituted by Ca2+-EGTA. The desired Ca2+concentration was calculated as described (26Dohet C. Al-Hillawi E. Trayer I.P. Rüegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out at room temperature. The normalized force-pCa relationships, in which force was expressed relative to the maximum force usually developed at pCa 4.34, were fitted to the Hill equation,f/fmax=[Ca2+]HC/(Kc+[Ca2+]HC)Equation 1 where HC (the Hill coefficient, a measure of cooperativity) and Kc are constants. Fiber bundles prepared as described above were washed with relaxing solution (ATP, 4 mm). Specimens were incubated with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (Sigma, 500 units/ml relaxing buffer) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 250 μCi/μm) for 45 min at room temperature (26Dohet C. Al-Hillawi E. Trayer I.P. Rüegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Venema R.C. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2705-2711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were then denatured, dissolved, and electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Major myofibrillar proteins were identified by Coomassie staining. 32P incorporation was visualized by autoradiography, using a 4–12-h exposure time with standard Kodak x-ray film (28Venema R.C. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2705-2711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hofmann P.A. Lange J.H. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To target theMYBP-C gene, a 9.1-kb fragment of the murine cardiac MYBP-C locus encompassing exons 1–20 was isolated and subcloned (Fig.1 B). The targeting construct was designed to selectively remove exons 3–6 (1.3 kb) thus producing a deletion of the Ig domain C1 and the linker region between domains C0 and C1 of cMyBP-C (Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1 B illustrates the cardiac MYBP-C locus and the gene-targeting construct containing a neomycin (NEO) resistance gene and a herpes simplex thymidine kinase cassette (TK) to allow for negative selection. Fig. 1 B (bottom) depicts the cMyBP-C deletion mutant obtained after electroporation of the linearized plasmid into ES cells and homologous recombination between the targeting vector and the cognate MYBP-C locus. Ninety-six G418-resistant ES cell clones were analyzed, and genomic Southern blotting of DNA from ES cell clones was performed to detect the targeting event. Correct targeting was found in 6 clones. As shown in Fig. 2 A, a band corresponding to a 9.1-kb fragment was detected as the wild-type allele, and a band corresponding to a 2.7-kb fragment as the targeted allele. Correctly targeted clones were used for blastocyst-mediated transgenesis and production of chimeric animals. Appropriate breeding produced mice either homozygous or heterozygous for the cMyBP-C deletion. These mice were fertile, produced normal litter sizes, and survived for >1 year. We also tested the correctly targeted clones in a long PCR assay. Primers were designed such that a 2.2-kb fragment was produced specific for the wild-type allele and a 1.9-kb fragment specific for the targeted allele (data not shown). Additionally, a PCR was done with a 4.8-kb product (Fig. 1 B, top). The analysis showed that the restriction enzyme Eco RI cut the amplificate only of the targeted allele into a 2.8 and a 2.0 kb fragment (Fig. 2 B), indicating the introduction of a new recognition site. To determine the expression of cMyBP-C transcripts in mutant mice, we performed RT-PCR analysis with various primer pairs from different regions of heart cDNA (Fig. 2 C). With a primer pair encompassing domains C0 to C1, a signal was obtained only for cDNA from wild-type or heterozygous mice, whereas in homozygous mutant animals, RNA encoding the C1 domain plus N-terminal adjacent linker was not expressed (Fig. 2 C,panel a). This observation is consistent with the results of Northern blot analyses (Fig. 2 D). No signal was detected when total RNA, isolated from homozygous hearts, was hybridized with a C1+linker probe. By contrast, a signal was detectable in heterozygous hearts. In comparison, when skeletal-muscle RNA was used, no signal was present (Fig. 2 D). Hybridization with a probe of the MyBP-C motif revealed a normal signal for heart RNA in all types of animals, but none for skeletal-muscle RNA. Controls with a GAPDH probe showed a signal in all lanes. By RT-PCR, using primer pairs encompassing the C0 domain and the MyBP-C motif, we detected the expected deletion of 474 base pairs (Fig.2 C, panel b). Cloning and sequencing of the products highlighted by the asterisks (Fig. 2 C) revealed that the upper band corresponds to the wild-type DNA sequence, whereas the lower band product has the same flanking sequence but contains the predicted deletion. We note that in competitive PCR, a shorter product tends to show a larger signal than a longer product, as seen in Fig. 2 C, panel b. This figure, as well as the RT-PCR at the 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 2 C,panel c), demonstrate that the transgenic RNA is stable and well expressed; no degradation or lowered expression was detectable. Thus, regulation at the transcription level seems unlikely. Both homozygous and heterozygous mice were found to express the deletion mutant also at the protein level. Western blot analyses with muscle protein obtained from all types of animals revealed a distinct band stained by a polyclonal antibody against the MyBP-C motif (Fig.3 A). Moreover, cardiac myofibrils labeled with fluorophore-marked α-MyBP-C antibodies exhibited the expected staining pattern in the sarcomeric A-band; no obvious difference in staining intensity or regularity of labeling was found between wild-type and homozygous mutant animals (Fig.3 B). Thus, mutant mice stably expressed the shortened cMyBP-C protein. Hearts from several months (up to ∼1 year) old animals (n = 7, for each animal type) were examined for histological and morphological abnormalities (Table I). None of the parameters investigated differed between animal types in a statistically significant manner, although one homozygous mutant heart revealed an abnormal phenotype with strongly increased values for all four parameters. In general, however, no evidence was found for cardiac hypertrophy, myocyte loss or inflammation. Thus, the histological appearance of heterozygous or homozygous mutant hearts appeared to be normal.Table ISummary of results of morphological measurementsHeart weightLV wall thicknessLV cavityMyocyte nuclear sizegmmmmμm2WT0.255 ± 0.0491.09 ± 0.304.09 ± 0.4448.71 ± 15.18+/−0.289 ± 0.0481.17 ± 0.214.49 ± 0.7944.00 ± 14.14−/−0.274 ± 0.0491.16 ± 0.354.31 ± 0.4252.57 ± 13.88Data are presented as mean ± S.D. n = 7 for wildtype (WT), heterozygous mutant (+/−), and homozygous mutant (−/−) hearts. Open table in a new tab Data are presented as mean ± S.D. n = 7 for wildtype (WT), heterozygous mutant (+/−), and homozygous mutant (−/−) hearts. Left ventricular muscle strips obtained from wild-type and mutant, litter-matched, animals were probed for their contractile properties by measuring the active force of skinned fiber bundles as a function of the Ca2+ concentration. Because the Ca2+sensitivity varies with sarcomere length, laser diffractometry was used to set this length to 2.2 μm in all experiments. A typical example demonstrating the force rise with increasing [Ca2+] (i.e. decreasing pCa) is shown in Fig.4, inset. Fibers from 5 wild-type, 2 cMyBP-C(+/−), and 6 cMyBP-C(−/−) mice were included in the analysis, and 5–7 fiber bundles per animal were investigated. A summary of results is presented in Fig. 4. Fibers from wild-type and heterozygous mutant mice exhibited a similar Ca2+ sensitivity of force development, with pCa50 values (pCa at half-maximum force) of 5.19 ± 0.01 S.E. and 5.18 ± 0.01 S.E. and Hill coefficients of 3.14 ± 0.06 S.E. and 3.00 ± 0.05 S.E., respectively. In contrast, homozygous mutant mice showed a statistically significant increase in Ca2+ sensitivity (pCa50 = 5.26 ± 0.02) and a decreased slope of the force-pCa curve (Hill coefficient, 2.32 ± 0.20). Thus, the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation was particularly increased at low to modest physiological [Ca2+], the concentrations relevant to normally working cardiac muscle. No statistically significant difference was found between animal types with regard to the (absolute) maximum active force levels (p > 0.05 in unpaired Student's t test). This indicates that the increase in relative force observed in the cMyBP-C(−/−) fibers mainly at lower [Ca2+] is not offset by a change in the maximum force level. To find out whether the altered Ca2+ sensitivity could be related to an altered response of the mutant cMyBP-C to activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (because the deletion is close to the MyBP-C motif), we tested the ability of the protein to be phosphorylated by this kinase (see Refs. 28Venema R.C.

As shown in Fig.5, autoradiography of SDS-polyacrylamide gels of left ventricular tissue incubated with the catalytic subunit of cAMK in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP revealed that both wild-type and the homozygous mutant cMyBP-C are phosphorylated to a similar degree (arrowheads in lanes d–g). Thus, the knock-in did not affect the phosphorylation of cMyBP-C, suggesting that the β-adrenergic pathway for this protein based on phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the MyBP-C motif may still be intact. The structural role of MyBP-C in both skeletal and cardiac myofibrils is well established (1Offer G. Moos C. Starr R. J. Mol.

Accordingly, C-terminal truncations of cardiac MyBP-C result in severe changes in heart ultrastructure and impaired cardiac mechanical performance, both in transgenic mouse models (18Yang Q. Sanbe A.

It is perhaps not surprising that, of the about 30 mutations in the gene for cMyBP-C (MYBPC3) so far described in families with FHC, the majority locates to C-terminal domains (14Bonne G. Carrier L. Richard P. Hainque B. Schwartz K. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 580-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some mutations also occur in N-terminal regions of the molecule, but in these cases the mechanisms leading to FHC are more difficult to understand. A possibility is that N-terminal domains of cMyBP-C contribute to the regulation of cardiac-muscle contraction. The knock-in mouse model presented here was generated in an attempt to uncover a possible (patho)physiological function of some of the N-terminal cMyBP-C domains. The knock-in was made bearing in mind that the cardiac isoform of MyBP-C is distinguished from the skeletal isoforms by two main features: (i) cMyBP-C contains an additional Ig domain, the C0 module (4Weber F.E.

An understanding of the transcriptional control mechanisms underlyingflk-1/KDR expression should provide insight into the molecular basis of angiogenesis. In this study, we show that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) down-regulates expression of the endogenous flk-1/KDR gene in endothelial cells. In transient transfection assays, this effect was mapped to a palindromic GATA site in the 5′-untranslated region.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). Of these two receptors, FLK-1/KDR appears to play a more prominent role in VEGF-mediated signaling. FLK-1/KDR is a membrane-bound receptor of the tyrosine kinase family that is expressed exclusively in endothelial cells. The FLK-1/KDR receptor is expressed early in the mouse embryo, where it is believed to play an important role in endothelial cell differentiation and vasculogenesis (2Shalaby F. Rossant J.

In addition, FLK-1/KDR may serve an important role in wound healing and bone remodeling (7Saadeh P.B. Mehrara B.J. Steinbrech D.S. Dudziak M.E. Greenwald J.A. Luchs J.S. Spector J.A. Ueno H. Gittes G.K. Longaker M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C628-C637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the transcriptional regulation of the flk-1/KDR gene might provide important information about the molecular basis of endothelial cell differentiation and angiogenesis. The human and mouseflk-1/KDR promoters have been sequenced and characterized (8Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol.

Under in vitro conditions, the 5′-flanking region and first exon have been shown to contain information for endothelial cell-specific expression, whereas in transgenic mouse assays, intronic enhancer sequences play a critical role in mediating expression within the vasculature (13Kappel A. Ronicke V. Damert A. Flamme I. Risau W. Breier G. Blood. 1999; 93: 4284-4292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the above studies provide insight into the mechanisms of endothelial cell-specific gene regulation, they do not address the question of how the flk-1/KDR promoter is temporally controlled by positive and negative regulators of angiogenesis. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) has a biphasic effect on basic fibroblast growth factor- and VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro (14Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.D. Orci L. Montesano R. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). At low concentrations TGF-β1 enhances endothelial cell response, whereas at high concentrations, TGF-β1 inhibits the effects of angiogenic factors such as VEGF or basic fibroblast growth factor on endothelial cells (14Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.D. Orci L. Montesano R. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 15Gajdusek C.M. Luo Z. Mayberg M.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In a previous study, TGF-β1 was shown to down-regulate expression offlk-1/KDR at the level of mRNA, total protein, and125I-VEGF binding capacity (16Mandriota S.J. Menoud P.A. Pepper M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11500-11505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These findings raised the interesting possibility that TGF-β1 exerts its anti-angiogenic effect, at least in part, through the inhibition of the VEGF signaling pathway. In this study, we extend these observations by showing that TGF-β1 suppresses flk-1/KDR expression through a palindromic GATA site in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) (Clonetics Corp.) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL-1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). BAEC were used within the first 10 passages. For construction of the 2.2-kbflk-1-luc plasmid, a region spanning −1940 to +296 bp of the human promoter was generated by exonuclease III digestion of the full-length flk-1/KDR promoter (generously provided by Cam Patterson, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX) and cloned into the pGL2-basic vector (Promega). To generate theKpn I-luc construct, the 2.2-kb flk-1-luc plasmid was digested with Kpn I, releasing a fragment spanning region −1940 to −115. The remaining vector was religated, resulting in a plasmid that contained −115 to +296 of the flk-1/KDR promoter coupled to luciferase. A series of internal deletions and point mutations were introduced into the flk-1/KDR promoter by polymerase chain reaction methodology. To generateKpn I(ΔGATA)-luc, two polymerase chain reaction fragments (A and B) were amplified from 2.2-kb flk-1-luc. Fragment A spanned a region between the Kpn I site at −115 and +102, whereas fragment B spanned a region between +187 and theXho I site of pGL2-basic. The primers were designed in such a way as to introduce an Nde I site in the deleted region. Fragment A was digested with Kpn I and Nde I, whereas fragment B was digested with Xho I andNde I. Fragments A and B were then inserted intoKpn I/Xho I-digested 2.2-kb flk-1-luc in a three-way ligation. The resulting plasmid contained a deletion offlk-1/KDR sequences between +103 and +187. A similar strategy was used to generate deletions of the Sp1 and NF-κB sites (Kpn I(ΔSp1/NF-κB)-luc), resulting in a plasmid that contained a deletion of flk-1/KDR sequences between −99 and −60. The same polymerase chain reaction strategy was employed to introduce the following mutations into the GATA (Kpn I(GATA mut)-luc), Sp1 (Kpn I(Sp1 mut)-luc), and NF-κB (Kpn I(NF-κB mut)-luc) motifs: Sp1 mut, GGGCGG → GTTCGG, CCGCCC → CCGTTC; NF-κB mut, GGAGAGCCCC → AAAGAGCCTT; and GATA mut, GGATATCC → GTTTAAGC. All deletions and mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. To generate pGEM-bflk, a 266-bp bovine flk-1/KDR cDNA fragment was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from reverse-transcribed BAEC total RNA and subcloned into the pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega). Similarly, pGEM-bGAPDH was derived by ligating a 371-bp bovine GAPDH cDNA fragment into pGEM-T-easy. BAEC were grown to confluence in 100-mm culture dishes, at which point the culture medium was replaced with serum-starved medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% FBS). 24 h later, BAEC were incubated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Peprotec) or with serum-starved medium alone. 24 h following TGF-β1 treatment, total RNA was purified using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). For in vitro transcription, flk-1/KDR- and GAPDH-specific 32P-labeled riboprobes were synthesized from pGEM-bflk and pGEM-bGAPDH, respectively. pGEM-bflk contains a 266-bp fragment of bovine flk-1, whereas pGEM-bGAPDH contains a 371-bp fragment of bovine GAPDH from +1 to +371 (see below). Both riboprobes were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion Inc.) and purified with a Sephadex G-50 spun column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNase protection assays were performed with an RPA III kit (Ambion Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BAEC and HEK-293 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as instructed by the manufacturer. BAEC (1 × 105 cells/well) or HEK-293 cells (2 × 105cells/well) were seeded in 12-well plates 18–24 h before transfection. For BAEC transfections, 0.12 pmol of the reporter gene construct and 50 ng of a control plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase reporter gene under the control of a cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter (pRL-CMV) (Promega) were incubated with 2 μl of FuGENE 6. For HEK-293 cell transfections, 0.05 pmol of the test construct, 50 ng of the control plasmid, and 0.075 pmol of the GATA expression vector were incubated with 2 μl of FuGENE 6. 24 h later, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured for 12 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% FBS. The cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 for 24 h, at which time they were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold). To study the effect of cell proliferation on flk-1/KDR promoter activity, BAEC (1 × 105 or 3 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well plates 18 h before transfection and assayed for luciferase activity 48 h later at a time when the cells were either pre-confluent or post-confluent, respectively. To determine the effect of serum starvation on promoter activity, transfected BAEC were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 24 h following transfection, incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FBS, and assayed for luciferase activity 18 h later. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (17Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow fragment and purified on the spun column. 15 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 10 fmol of32P-labeled probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2.5 fmol of ZnSO4, and 3 μl of 10× binding buffer (100 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 50% glycerol, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm EDTA) for 30 min at room temperature and then at 4 °C for a further 30 min. To test the effect of antibodies on DNA-protein binding, nuclear extracts were preincubated with anti-GATA-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and a generous gift from Dr. Stuart Orkin) or anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. In competition studies, a 10-, 50-, or 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 5% glycerol in 0.5× buffer containing 50 mmTris, 50 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA. The loaded gel was fixed with 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid and then autoradiographed. DNase I footprint assays were carried out as previously described (18Jones K.A. Yamamoto K.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1985; 42: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment spanning region −111 to +296 of the human flk-1/KDR gene was isolated by digesting the 2.2-kb flk-1-luc plasmid withKpn I and Xho I. The 3′-end of the coding strand was filled in with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow enzyme. 8 fmol of the labeled probe was mixed with 60 μg of nuclear extracts and digested with DNase I (Takara Biochemicals, Inc.) at room temperature for 2 min. The samples were loaded on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The loaded gel was fixed with 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid and then autoradiographed. Our first goal was to confirm whether TGF-β1 down-regulates expression of flk-1/KDR in bovine aortic endothelial cells. To this end, we employed RNase protection assays with a probe that is specific for the bovineflk-1/KDR gene and total RNA derived from control and TGF-β1-treated cells. As shown in Fig.1 (A and B), the incubation of BAEC in the presence of 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h resulted in a 60% reduction in flk-1/KDR mRNA. We next wished to determine whether the effect of TGF-β1 on flk-1/KDR mRNA expression was mediated by the flk-1/KDR promoter. BAEC were transiently transfected with the 2.2-kb flk-1-luc plasmid, which contains a 2.2-kb region of the human flk-1/KDR promoter (between −1960 and +296) coupled to the luciferase reporter gene. Transfected BAEC were grown in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 and assayed for luciferase activity 24 h later. As shown in Fig. 2 A, TGF-β1 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in reporter gene activity, with maximal suppression occurring at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. In subsequent studies, we demonstrated that a promoter fragment spanning region −115 to +296 (Kpn I-luc) contained the information for TGF-β1-mediated down-regulation (data not shown). Finally, to determine whether the effect of TGF-β1 on flk-1/KDR promoter activity was mediated by changes in the cell cycle, we compared reporter gene activity in pre-confluent and post-confluent BAEC as well as in serum-replete and serum-starved BAEC. As shown in Fig. 2(B and C), luciferase activity did not vary between these conditions, arguing against a direct effect of cell proliferation on flk-1/KDR promoter activity. The humanflk-1/KDR promoter contains a number of consensus binding sites, including Sp1, NF-κB, and GATA (8Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Previous studies have implicated a role for the Sp1- and NF-κB-binding sites, but not the 5′-UTR GATA motif, in mediating constitutive expression of the gene (8Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,12Hata Y. Duh E. Zhang K. Robinson G.S. Aiello L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19294-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To test whether one or more of these elements were involved in transducing the TGF-β1 signal, the Sp1, NF-κB, and GATA elements were deleted and/or mutated, and the resulting plasmids were transfected into BAEC. A combined deletion of the NF-κB site and two upstream Sp1 sites (Kpn I(ΔSp1/NF-κB)-luc) resulted in significant reduction (3.8-fold) in basal promoter activity (Fig.3). A 4-bp mutation of the NF-κB site (Kpn I(NF-κB mut)-luc) also resulted in a 3.7-fold reduction in promoter activity, whereas a 2-bp mutation of the two upstream Sp1 sites (Kpn I(Sp1 mut)-luc) resulted in only a 10% reduction in promoter activity. These latter findings are consistent with previously published studies (12Hata Y. Duh E. Zhang K. Robinson G.S. Aiello L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19294-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, to our surprise, a 4-bp mutation of the GATA site in the 5′-UTR (Kpn I (GATA mut)-luc) resulted in significant reduction (4.4-fold) in reporter gene activity, suggesting that the GATA element is in fact important for basal expression (Fig. 3). TGF-β1-mediated down-regulation of 2.2-kbflk-1-luc and Kpn I-luc was preserved in constructs that contained a deletion or mutation of the Sp1 and/or NF-κB sites (Fig. 3, compare −TGF-β with+TGF-β). In contrast, a deletion or mutation of the 5′-UTR GATA palindrome completely abrogated the inhibitory response (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results suggest that the palindromic GATA site in the 5′-UTR of the flk-1/KDR gene is necessary for basal expression and TGF-β1-mediated inhibition offlk-1/KDR promoter activity. The above results raised the possibility that TGF-β1 inhibitsflk-1/KDR expression by interfering with GATA binding to the 5′-UTR. To test this hypothesis, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays in which nuclear extracts derived from untreated and TGF-β1-treated BAEC were incubated with a 5′-UTR GATA probe encompassing the putative palindromic GATA site (+98 to +122) (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig. 4(B–D), incubation of nuclear extract from untreated BAEC with the 32P-labeled probe resulted in the appearance of two specific DNA-protein complexes (open and closed arrows). The DNA-protein complexes were inhibited by the addition of a 10–200-fold molar excess of unlabeled self-competitor (Fig. 4,B, lane 3; and C, lanes 3–5). Moreover, the complexes were significantly inhibited by the addition of an oligonucleotide probe competitor containing a GATA motif from the human endothelin-1 (hET-1) promoter (Fig. 4 C,lanes 6–8). In contrast, DNA-protein binding was unaltered in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe containing a 4-bp mutation of the flk-1/KDR GATA sites (Fig.4 B, lane 4). Of the various members of the GATA transcription factor family, GATA-2 is believed to play the most prominent role in endothelial cells. To determine whether the DNA complex contained GATA-2 protein, the binding reactions were incubated with anti-GATA-2 antibodies. The addition of an anti-GATA-2 antibody from Dr. Stuart Orkin resulted in a supershift of the upper DNA-protein complex (Fig. 4 B, lane 5, asterisk), whereas the addition of an anti-GATA-2 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology inhibited formation of both DNA-protein complexes (lane 6). In contrast, incubation with an antibody against Sp1 had no effect (Fig. 4 B, lane 7). Taken together, these data suggest that the 5′-UTR palindromic GATA site binds to GATA-2. Interestingly, the 5′-UTR GATA site consists of two overlapping motifs on opposite DNA strands. To determine whether this palindromic sequence binds to one or two molecules of GATA-2, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out with a probe containing a mutation of a single GATA site. The incubation of this mutant probe with nuclear extract resulted in a single DNA-protein complex that corresponded to the faster migrating complex of the wild-type probe and to the specific DNA-protein complex of the hET-1 probe (Fig. 4 D). These results suggest that the more slowly migrating complex seen only with the wild-type 5′-UTR probe represents a complex between the palindromic GATA site and two molecules of GATA protein. Finally, to test the effect of TGF-β1 on GATA binding, mobility shift assays were carried out with nuclear extracts derived from TGF-β1-treated BAEC. TGF-β1 treatment did not result in a change in mobility pattern, but rather in a significant (3-fold by densitometry) reduction in the intensity of the GATA-binding complexes (Fig. 4, B, lanes 8–13; and C, lanes 9–12). To confirm the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on GATA binding, we carried out DNase I footprint analyses with a labeled promoter fragment containing region −115 to +296 of the flk-1/KDR gene. As shown in Fig.5, the region spanning the 5′-UTR GATA elements was protected by nuclear protein derived from untreated BAEC, but not from TGF-β1-treated BAEC. These results are consistent with those of the mobility shift assays and strongly support the conclusion that TGF-β1 inhibits binding of GATA protein to the 5′-UTR. Having established the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on GATA binding in vitro, we wished to study the functional relevance of this interaction in vivo. To this end, we carried out transactivation assays in which the 2.2-kbflk-1-luc or Kpn I-luc constructs were cotransfected with expression plasmids for either mouse GATA-1 (pXM-mGATA1) or human GATA-2 (pMT2-hGATA2) in HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 6 (A and B), cotransfection of GATA-1 or GATA-2 induced the full-length flk-1/KDR promoter activity by 9.0- or 11.8-fold, respectively. Similar results were obtained with the shorterKpn I-luc construct, suggesting that the palindromic GATA site in the 5′-UTR is sufficient for mediating this effect (Fig. 6,A and B). Indeed, Kpn I-luc constructs containing a deletion (Kpn I(ΔGATA)-luc) or mutation (Kpn I(GATA mut)-luc) of the 5′-UTR GATA site failed to respond to GATA-1 or GATA-2 overexpression (Fig. 6, A andB). Finally, when cotransfected HEK-293 cells were incubated with TGF-β1, transactivation of the flk-1/KDR promoter by GATA-1 and GATA-2 was attenuated by 2.3- and 4.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 7). Together, these findings support the conclusion that TGF-β1 suppression of flk-1/KDR expression is mediated by the 5′-UTR palindromic GATA sequence.Figure 7Attenuation of GATA-1- and GATA-2-mediated transactivation of the flk-1/KDR promoter by TGF-β1. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected as described in the legend to Fig. 6. Cells were serum-starved, incubated with or without TGF-β1 for 24 h, and then assayed for luciferase activity. The expression levels were normalized to pRL-CMV activity and expressed as -fold induction relative to cotransfection with vector alone. The means ± S.D. were derived from at least three separate experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) VEGF-mediated signaling through the FLK-1/KDR receptor is believed to play a critical role in angiogenesis both during development as well as in the adult. Temporal regulation of flk-1/KDR expression within the endothelium may represent an important mechanism for modulating activity of this signaling pathway. For example, in the embryo, flk-1/KDR is expressed in the developing vasculature, whereas in the adult, flk-1/KDR is expressed at sites of physiological and pathophysiological angiogenesis. An understanding of the transcriptional control mechanisms that regulateflk-1/KDR expression in these settings may provide important information about the molecular control of angiogenesis. Under in vitro conditions, the flk-1/KDR promoter has been shown to direct endothelial cell-specific expression. Maximal promoter activity of the human gene resides in fragment −225 to +268 (8Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), whereas endothelial cell-specific expression of the mouse gene is mediated by sequences between −623 and +299 (9Ronicke V. Risau W. Breier G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There are several conserved cis-regulatory elements in the mouse and human promoters, including Sp1-, AP-2-, NF-κB-, and GATA-binding sites (8Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,9Ronicke V. Risau W. Breier G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Previous studies of the human promoter have supported an important role for upstream AP-2, NF-κB, and Sp1 elements in mediating cell type-specific expression in cultured endothelial cells (8Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Hata Y. Duh E. Zhang K. Robinson G.S. Aiello L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19294-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this study, we confirmed the importance of the upstream NF-κB site in mediating basal expression of the flk-1/KDR promoter. In addition, we demonstrated a role for an overlapping palindromic GATA sequence in mediating constitutive promoter activity. These results are in sharp contrast to a previous study in which a 3-bp mutation of the 5′-UTR GATA site was shown to have no effect on expression levels (8Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. Both studies employed primary cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells. In the study by Patterson et al. (8Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the GGATATCC site was mutated to GGTCGTCC, whereas in this study, GGATATCC was mutated to GTTTAAGC. Despite these differences, both mutations are predicted to eliminate GATA binding to the two GATA sites. It is noteworthy that the GGTCGTCC mutation was analyzed in a promoter that spanned −225 to +268 bp, whereas GTTTAAGC was studied in fragment −150 to +296. However, it is unlikely that such small differences in promoter context would account for the disparate results. In the final analysis, our findings strongly support a role for the 5′-UTR GATA motif in mediating basal expression of flk-1/KDR. Several factors have been implicated in the temporal regulation offlk-1/KDR expression. For example, tumor necrosis factor-α has been shown to induce expression of both the endogenousflk-1/KDR gene and the upstream promoter (19Giraudo E. Primo L. Audero E. Gerber H.P. Koolwijk P. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Ferrara N. Bussolino F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22128-22135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 20Illi B. Puri P. Morgante L. Capogrossi M.C. Gaetano C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E110-E117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas TGF-β1 inhibits flk-1/KDR mRNA levels in endothelial cells. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that control TGF-β1-mediated down-regulation offlk-1/KDR expression, we examined the effect of TGF-β1 on flk-1/KDR promoter activity. The results are consistent with a model in which TGF-β1represses flk-1/KDR expression by inhibiting the interaction of GATA-2 with overlapping double GATA consensus sites in the 5′-UTR. In vertebrate promoters, most GATA elements occur as single sites or as direct repeats. Rarely do GATA sequences overlap one another on opposite sides of the DNA (21Trainor C.D. Omichinski J.G. Vandergon T.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These palindromic motifs are unique in that they interact with both the C- and N-terminal domains of GATA protein, resulting in high affinity binding (21Trainor C.D. Omichinski J.G. Vandergon T.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, to date, palindromic GATA sequences have been shown to bind only one molecule of GATA protein. In contrast, the results of this study suggest that the 5′-UTR GATA palindrome may complex with two molecules of GATA protein. It is conceivable that the two molecules of GATA protein bind to the overlapping GATA elements. Alternatively, GATA-GATA protein interactions may result in dimerization at the GATA site (22Mackay J.P. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30560-30567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that a heterodimer involving the GATA transcription factor and another protein is binding to the double GATA motif. Regardless of the mechanism, the unique configuration and binding properties of the 5′-UTR GATA motif may be important determinants for both basal expression and TGF-β1-mediated repression of the flk-1/KDR gene. TGF-β1 may have several effects on transcriptional pathways. TGF-β1-mediated activation of its cognate receptor results in phosphorylation of cytoplasmic transcription factors of the SMAD family. In addition, TGF-β1may act indirectly through other families of transcription factors to attenuate gene expression. In some cases, these mechanisms serve to repress basal expression levels. For example, TGF-β1inhibits cyclin A promoter activity by decreasing the phosphorylation and activity of activating transcription factor-1 and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (23Yoshizumi M. Wang H. Hsieh C.M. Sibinga N.E. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22259222-22259264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In other cases, TGF-β1signaling results in an inhibition of inducible gene expression. For example, TGF-β1 antagonizes phorbol ester-mediated transcriptional induction of matrix metalloproteinase-1 through a TGF-β inhibitory element (24White L.A. Mitchell T.I. Brinckerhoff C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In intestinal epithelial cells, TGF-β1 attenuates glucocorticoid-mediated induction of haptoglobin mRNA by inhibiting CAAT/enhancer-binding protein binding to the proximal promoter (25Yu S.J. Boudreau F. Desilets A. Houde M. Rivard N. Asselin C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our report is the first to implicate the GATA family of DNA-binding proteins in mediating the inhibitory effects of TGF-β1. The transfection and DNA-protein binding assays suggest that TGF-β1 represses flk-1/KDR expression by interfering with the binding of GATA protein to its cognate binding sites in the first exon. There are several possible explanations for this effect. First, TGF-β1 may inhibit GATA expression at a transcriptional level. It is interesting to note that in hematopoietic cells, neutralization of TGF-β1 results in increased GATA mRNA (26Pierelli L. Marone M. Bonanno G. Mozzetti S. Rutella S. Morosetti R. Rumi C. Mancuso S. Leone G. Scambia G. Blood. 2000; 95: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our observation that GATA-mediated activation of the flk-1/KDR promoter is inhibited in cotransfection assays argues against this mechanism. A second possibility is that TGF-β1 induces the binding of other transcription factor(s) to sequences within the vicinity of the GATA site, resulting in competitive inhibition of GATA binding. This seems unlikely since TGF-β1 does not result in a change in the pattern of mobility of the DNA-protein complexes. A final consideration is that TGF-β1 alters GATA activity at a post-transcriptional level. Previous studies have shown that GATA binding is influenced both by its phosphorylation state (27Towatari M.

Sci. 1999; 868: 741-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). HCN channels contain six transmembrane helices (S1-S6), including a voltage-sensing S4 segment, a pore region between S5 and S6 and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) in the C terminus. Ih channels are tightly regulated by neurotransmitters and metabolic stimuli. It is well known that cAMP enhances the activation of Ih by directly binding to the CNBD of the channel and thereby shifting the voltage dependence of its activation curve to more positive values and speeding up its activation kinetics (22DiFrancesco D. Tortora P. Nature. 1991; 351: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Up-regulation ofIh by cAMP underlies the positive chronotropic effect of catecholamines in heart as well as the regulation of oscillation patterns of neuronal networks by neurotransmitters that stimulate cAMP synthesis (1DiFrancesco D. Morad M. Ebashi S. Trautwein W. Kurachi Y. Molecular Physiology and Pharmacology of Cardiac Ion Channels and Transporters.

Recently, Munsch and Pape (27Munsch T. Pape H.-C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 493-504Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Munsch T. Pape H.-C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 505-514Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) provided first evidence for an additional kind of Ih regulation. They showed that Ih of thalamocortical neurons is sensitive to shifts of the intracellular pH (pHi). Alkalinization induced an increase of the Ih amplitude, whereas acidification inhibited the current. Although it could not be unequivocally decided whether protons act directly on theIh channel or modulate Ihvia an indirect pathway, these findings suggested that pHi-mediated modulation of Ih may provide an important mechanism to control the activity of neuronal networks in vivo. A possible modulation ofIh by protons would also have profound implications concerning the role of Ih under pathophysiological conditions in a variety of cell types and tissues. As a first step to address this important issue, we have investigated the molecular basis of pH sensitivity of the heterologously expressed HCN2 channel. Within the HCN channel family HCN2 is the most abundantly expressed member. It is found in heart cells (14Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 15Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and in most parts of the brain including the thalamus (29Moosmang S. Biel M. Hofmann F. Ludwig A. Biol.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the heterologously expressed HCN2 channel reveals all functional properties attributed to native Ih, i.e. activation by hyperpolarization, permeation of Na+ and K+, block by Cs+, and activation by cAMP (14Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 15Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M.

(Lond.). 2000; 439: 618-626Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that protons reversibly inhibit the HCN2 current by shifting the activation curve of the channel to more hyperpolarizing membrane potentials. We identified a highly conserved histidine residue localized at the C-terminal end of the S4 segment that confers most if not all of the pH effect. All channel mutants were constructed in the expression vector for murine HCN2 (mHCN2, former designation HAC1 (14Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar)). Point mutations were introduced with polymerase chain reaction. The correctness of the introduced mutations and all sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction were verified by sequencing. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding either wild-type or mutant HCN2 channels using conventional calcium-phosphate transfection methods. Currents were measured at room temperature 2–3 days after transfection using either whole cell, outside-out, or inside-out patch clamp techniques. The extracelluar solution was composed of (in mm): 110, NaCl; 0.5, MgCl2; 1.8, CaCl2; 5, HEPES; 30, KCl. The intracellular solution contained (in mm): 130, KCl; 10, NaCl; 0.5, MgCl2; 1, EGTA; 5, HEPES. The pH of intracellular (pHi) and extracellular (pHe) solutions was adjusted to various pH values by using KOH for pHi and NaOH for pHe. Data were acquired at 10 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 7 (Axon Instruments) and were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz with an 8-pole Bessel filter (LPBF-48DG, npi). Voltage clamp data were stored on the computer hard drive and analyzed off-line by using Clampfit (Axon Instruments). Steady-state activation curves were determined by hyperpolarizing voltages (−150 to −95 mV for inside-out and outside-out patch measurements, respectively; −150 to −30 mV for whole cell recording) from a holding potential of −40 mV for 2.8 s followed by a step to −150 mV. Tail currents measured immediately after the final step to −150 mV were normalized by the maximal current (Imax) and plotted as a function of the preceding membrane potential. The data points were fitted with the Boltzmann function: (I-Imin)/(Imax-Imin) = 1/(1-exp[(Vm - V0.5)/k)] whereImin is an offset caused by a nonzero holding current, Vm is the test potential, V0.5 is the membrane potential for half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. As has been described earlier for expressed HCN2 channel (14Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) and native Ih (32DiFrancesco D. Mangoni M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 474: 473-482Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar), V0.5 was dependent on the configuration of the electrophysiological measurement. At pH 7.4, V0.5 of HCN2 was −104 ± 1.6 mV (n = 6; see Fig. 5 B), −117 ± 1.5 mV (n = 6; see Fig. 4 B) and −125 ± 1.3 mV (n = 16; see Fig. 5 C) in whole-cell, outside-out, and inside-out mode, respectively. Similarly, in inside-out patches, V0.5 of mutant channels was also shifted by about 20–25 mV to more hyperpolarizing voltages with respect to the V0.5 values measured in whole cell mode (see Fig. 5, B and C).Figure 4The HCN2 channel is not sensitive to shifts in external pH (pHe). A, current traces evoked from an excised outside-out patch by stepping from a holding potential of −40 mV to −125 mV and then to −150 mV.

As has been described earlier (15Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the initial lag in the activation of HCN channel was excluded from the fitting procedure. All values are given as mean ± S.E.; n is the number of experiments. To test for a possible modulation of HCN channels by shifts in intracellular pH (pHi), we transiently expressed the murine HCN2 channel in HEK293 cells. Inward currents were activated from excised inside-out patches of transfected cells by subsequently stepping from a holding potential of −40 mV to −130 mV, a voltage at which the channel is about half-maximal activated, and then to −150 mV, a voltage at which the channel is fully activated. Fig.1 A shows current traces obtained from an inside-out patch measured at different pHivalues in the bath solution. Whereas the maximal current amplitude at −150 mV was clearly not altered by switching between pHi6.4 and pHi 8.4; the current amplitude measured at-130 mV was strongly dependent on pHi being smaller under acidic conditions and bigger at alkaline pHi. The effect of pHi on the current amplitude was fully reversible and not because of a time-dependent increase or rundown of the current (Fig. 1 B). We next determined the voltage dependence of the HCN2 activation for a range of pHi values (Fig. 2). Acidic pHi (6.0) led to a leftward shift of the half-maximal activation voltage (V0.5) to about 10 mV more negative potentials (V0.5(pHi 6.0) = −134 ± 1.3 mV,n = 11), whereas alkaline pHi (9.0) resulted in a shift of V0.5 to 10 mV more positive potentials (V0.5(pHi 9.0) = −114 ± 2.9 mV,n = 6), as compared with V0.5 at the control pHi of 7.4 (V0.5(pHi 7.4) = −125 ± 1.6 mV, n = 12). In contrast, shifts in pHi had no major influence on the steepness of the activation curve (kpHi 6.0 = 4.3 ± 0.4 mV;kpHi 7.4 = 4.4 ± 0.5 mV;kpHi 9.0 = 6.3 ± 0.8 mV). By plotting V0.5 versus pHi and fitting the data with a sigmoidal equation, a titration curve for the pHidependence of HCN2 was obtained (Fig. 2 B). The pHi effect on V0.5 was most pronounced in the range between pHi 7.0 and pHi 8.0 whereas further acidification or alkalinization had significantly less effect. The calculated pKa value was 7.6, which is within the range of normal cellular pHi. This finding indicated that modulation of HCN channel by protons may be physiologically important. Single-exponential fits to current traces recorded at different pHi values indicated a strong dependence of the kinetics of channel opening on pHi (Fig. 2 C). At −130 mV, the time constant (τact) of channel activation decreased significantly with an increase in pHi. At pHi6.0, the time constant was 6.8 ± 1.6 s (n = 12), whereas it was 2.2 ± 0.6 s (n = 12) at pHi 7.4 and 0.3 ± 0.02 s (n = 6) at pHi 9.0. The pHi effect on activation kinetics was profoundly influenced by the membrane potential. It was very pronounced in the voltage range of V0.5 but disappeared completely at −150 mV when the channel was fully activated (τact(pHi 6.0): 0.28 ± 0.02 s; τact(pHi 7.4): 0.28 ± 0.02 s; τact(pHi 9.0): 0.26 ± 0.05 s). The modulation of HCN current by shifts in pHi resembled the cAMP-mediated modulation of Ih in two major characteristics. 1) It affected the voltage dependence of channel activation, and 2) it affected the speed of channel activation. We therefore tested whether both kinds of channel modulation interfered with each other. Fig. 3 shows activation curves determined at different pHi in the absence and presence of a saturating cAMP concentration (10 μm) in the internal solution. At each pHi, cAMP induced a profound shift of the V0.5 to more positive values. The shift was strongest at acidic pHi (ΔV0.5 (pH 7.0) = +22 mV, shift from −132 ± 1.8 mV (n = 3) to −110 ± 1.0 mV (n = 3)) and became increasingly weaker when pHi was altered to physiological pHi (ΔV0.5 (pH 7.4) = +18 mV, shift from −128 ± 1.1 mV (n = 4) to −110 ± 3.8 mV (n = 3)) and to alkaline pHi (ΔV 0.5 (pH 7.9) = +12 mV, shift from −118 ± 1.2 mV (n = 5) to −106 ± 2.6 mV (n = 4)). On the other hand, although the channel was very sensitive to shifts in pHi under control conditions (shift of V0.5 of +14 mV between pHi 7.0 and pHi 7.9 in the absence of cAMP), it became rather insensitive to pHi when it was fully activated by a saturating cAMP concentration (shift of V0.5 of +4 mV between pHi 7.0 and pHi 7.9 at 10 μm cAMP). This result suggested that modulation of the channel by intracellular protons critically depends on the basal activity of the channel. Finally we tested whether HCN2 currents could be modulated by shifts in external pH (pHe). Fig.4 A shows current traces evoked at three different pHe values from the same outside-out patch by stepping to −125 mV and −150 mV. It is evident that both current amplitudes and kinetics were unaffected by acidification or alkalinization. Similarly, the activation curves determined at different pHe values (Fig. 4 B) revealed no shift in V0.5 or alteration of the slope factors (pHe6.0: V0.5 = −116 ± 1.7 mV, k = 3.9 ± 0.5 mV, n = 6; pHe 7.4: V0.5 = −117 ± 1.5 mV, k = 5.1 ± 0.8 mV, n = 6; pHe 9.0: V0.5= −119 ± 4.1 mV, k = 3.4 ± 0.7 mV,n = 4). Thus, modulation of the HCN2 channel by pH revealed a profound site preference being restricted to shifts in internal pH. Our experiments suggested that protons inhibit HCN2 by binding to a titratable acceptor side of the channel, which faces the intracellular environment. Because the pKadeduced from the HCN2 titration curve was 7.6, we postulated that a histidine residue (pKa = 6.0) would be the most likely candidate for providing a proton binding site. By contrast, the pKa values of lysine (pKa = 10.5) and arginine (pKa = 12.5) are far away from the observed range of pH regulation. HCN channels contain several histidine residues that principally could confer the pH effect. The finding that protonation induced a shift in the activation curve prompted us to focus on residues in the cytoplasmic S4-S5 linker, which has been shown to control together with the S4 segment the activation of K+ channels (33Franzqueza L. Lin M. Splawski I. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21063-21070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The sequence of the S4 segment and the S4-S5 linker is completely conserved in HCN1–4 (Fig.5 A). A histidine residue in this sequence, His-321, is positioned “in-frame” with the nine regularly spaced arginines and lysines of the S4 segment suggesting that it may be part of the voltage-sensing and/or gating machinery of the channel. To investigate the role of His-321, we replaced the residue with either a positively charged arginine (H321R), a neutral glutamine (H321Q), or an acidic glutamate (H321E). Replacement by arginine did not significantly alter the voltage dependence of activation at physiological pHi as determined in whole cell mode (Fig. 5 B) or in excised inside-out patches (Fig.5 C). Similarly, mutation of His-321 to glutamine only weakly affected the activation curve. It induced a slight shift of the V0.5 to about a 5 mV more positive voltage with respect to the wild-type channel (Fig. 5, B and C). By contrast, the V0.5 was profoundly shifted to the right (ΔV0.5 = +20 mV) when His-321 was exchanged by the negatively charged glutamate residue (Fig. 5, B andC). Determination of reversal potentials from current/voltage relationships of the fully activated channels (14Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M.

We next asked whether HCN2 mutants were sensitive to alterations of pHi (Fig. 6). Activation curves determined from inside-out patches revealed that pHisensitivity was almost completely lost in H321R (Fig. 6 A), H321Q (Fig. 6 B), and H321E (Fig. 6 C). Again, the activation curves of the H321E mutant were significantly shifted to more depolarizing voltages when compared with H213R, H321Q, and wild-type channels. The loss of pHi-dependent shifts in V0.5 of mutant channels was mirrored by a loss of pHi effect on activation kinetics (Fig. 6 D). Whereas in wild-type channel alkalinization led to a pronounced decrease of τ values at −130 mV (Fig. 2 C), activation constants of H321R and H321Q were not significantly altered by shifts in pHi under the same conditions. However, as in wild-type, channel activation constants of HCN2 mutants were dependent on the membrane potential reaching a minimal value at voltages that fully activated the channel (−150 mV) and increasing with membrane depolarization. Similar results were obtained with the H321E mutant (not shown). We finally investigated whether the replacement of His-321 in HCN2 interefered with the cAMP modulation of the channels. Activation curves were measured at pHi7.4 for wild type (Fig.7 A), H321R (Fig.7 B), H321Q (Fig. 7 C), and H321E (Fig.7 D) in whole cell mode under control conditions and after intracellular perfusion with 1 mm cAMP. Cyclic AMP shifted the V0.5 of all three mutants to 20–25 mV more positive values. The V0.5 values for H321R, H321Q, and H321E were −102 ± 2.6 mV (n = 6), −96.7 ± 1.7 mV (n = 8) and −85.2 ± 1.7 mV (n = 8) in the absence of cAMP and −76.8 ± 1.4 mV (n= 3), −73.3 ± 4.1 mV (n = 5) and −66.4 ± 4.1 mV (n = 4) in the presence of cAMP, respectively. These values are in the same range as the shift observed for wild-type HCN2 (V0.5 = −104 ± 1.6 mV (n = 6) in the absence, and −75.5 ± 3.6 mV (n = 5) in the presence of cAMP) indicating that mutation of His-321 does not alter the cAMP-mediated activation of HCN2. This study demonstrates for the first time the modulation of a heterologously expressed HCN channel by protons. Like nativeIh, HCN2 is specifically modulated by shifts in cytosolic pH but is not sensitive to changes in external pH. The modulation by internal protons refers to two aspects of HCN2 channel activation, namely its voltage dependence and its kinetics. Intracellular acidification induces a down-regulation of the current by shifting the activation curve to the left and also slows down the speed of activation. Alkalinization enhances the current by shifting the activation curve to more depolarized voltages and in addition accelerates opening kinetics. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that protons modulate Ih by directly binding to the HCN channel molecule. By contrast, there is no evidence that additional factors or auxiliary channel subunits are necessary to confer this effect. By using site-directed mutagenesis we have identified a single amino acid in the HCN2 primary sequence (His-321) that is a major determinant of the pHi modulation. Replacement of this histidine residue by a nontitratable residue (H321Q) or by residues that at physiological pHi are either positively (H321R) or negatively (H321E) charged almost completely abolished sensitivity to pHi. By contrast, these mutations did not alter the ion selectivity and the kinetics of the fully activated channels. Whereas all three mutants lacked pHi sensitivity, they also differed from each other in their respective V0.5values. The activation curve was shifted to more and more positive values in the order of H321R, H321Q, and H321E. This finding suggests that the electrical charge at position 321 may be involved in the mechanism that regulates HCN channel activity. However, charge effects alone are not sufficient to explain the inhibitory effect of protons. If the electrical charge at position 321 would be the major determinant of V0.5 one would expect the V0.5 of the H321R mutant to be more negative than the V0.5 of the wild-type channel. This is clearly not the case. In contrary, protons even shift the V0.5 of the wild-type channel to values that are significantly more negative than the V0.5 of the H321R mutant. How might His-321 control the voltage dependence of channel activation? His-321 is separated by two neutral amino acid residues from the last positive charged residue of S4. Thus, His-321 could either constitute the C terminus of the S4 helix or the N terminus of the S4-S5 linker. Recent studies indicate that the C-terminal end of S4 of Shaker K+ channel subunits is accessible by thiol-reactive reagents from the cytoplasm making it impossible to precisely define the boundary between S4 helix and S4-S5 linker (35Baker O.S. Larsson H.P. Mannuzzu L.M. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1283-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In any case, the localization of His-321 is very consistent with a possible role in modulating channel activation. The S4 segment has been demonstrated to constitute the main component of the voltage sensor in calcium, sodium, and potassium channels (36Horn R. Neuron. 2000; 25: 511-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that replacement of charged residues in the S4 of HCN channels profoundly influences the voltage dependence of channel activation (37Vaca L. Stieber J. Zong X. Ludwig A. Hofmann F. Biel M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38Chen J. Mitcheson J.S. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36465-36471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, conformational changes induced by the protonation or deprotonation of His-321 could well interfere with the voltage-dependent movement of the S4 helix. There is also evidence that the S4-S5 linker is an important determinant of voltage-dependent gating in other channels. Mutations in the S4-S5 linker of the KCNQ1 channel associated with long QT syndrome induce shifts in the voltage dependence of channel activation (33Franzqueza L. Lin M. Splawski I. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21063-21070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similarly, the S4-S5 linker was shown to be a crucial component of the activation gate of HERG K+ channel (34Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is thus tempting to speculate that as in these K+channels, the S4-S5 linker of HCN channels transduces movement of the voltage-sensing S4 helix into opening of the channel. Our data indicate that His-321 could play a key role in this transduction process. Mutant channels that had lost sensitivity to shifts in pHicould still be activated by cAMP indicating that cAMP-mediated modulation of voltage dependence of channel activation is not controlled by His-321. In addition, wild-type HCN2 is up-regulated by cAMP over a broad range of pHi supporting the notion that cAMP-mediated modulation works independent of pHi. On the other hand, pHi-mediated shifts in V0.5 are profoundly influenced by the intracellular cAMP concentration being significantly larger in the absence than in the presence of the cyclic nucleotide. This finding could be explained by the presence of allosteric interactions between the molecular pathways that confer proton- and cAMP-mediated channel modulation. Given the very abundant expression of HCN2 in most parts of brain and heart, modulation of this channel by pHi is of significant physiological importance. Because the S4-S5 region including the His-321 residue is completely conserved in all other mammalian HCN channels cloned so far, sensitivity to pHi presumably is a general feature of HCN channels. Thalamic neurons produce a range of complex firing patterns such as tonic bursts and slow δ oscillations that control brain functions like the phases of sleep and the information flow through the thalamus toward the cerebral cortex (2Pape H.-C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 299-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 21Santoro B. Tibbs G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 741-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It is well established that modulation of Ih by neurotransmitters that up- or down-regulate cellular cAMP or cGMP concentrations plays a key role in the control of thalamic oscillations (23Pape H.-C. Mager R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 441-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 39Bal T. McCormick D.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 40Lüthi A. McCormick D.A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that shifts in pHi may provide an additional regulatory pathway of neuronal network activity. The sensitivity ofIh to shifts in pHi may also be important in neurological diseases. Acidification as occurring during epileptiform discharges (41De, Curtis M Manfridi A. Biella G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7543-7551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could inhibit Ih, thereby counteracting the Ca2+-mediated positive shift in the Ih activation curve (40Lüthi A. McCormick D.A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and, hence, prolonging the duration of burst activity. In accordance with this model, it was recently postulated that the anticonvulsant action of acetazolamide is related to an intracellular alkalinization of thalamic neurons causing an up-regulation of Ih (28Munsch T. Pape H.-C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 505-514Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is well known that the respiratory frequency is increased in response to acidosis and hypoxia. Recently, it was shown in inspiratory neurons of the brainstem that an increase in the respiratory frequency can be induced by the blockade of Ih by Cs+ or the specific Ih blocker ZD7288 (7Thoby-Brisson M. Telgkamp P. Ramirez J.-M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2994-3005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to assume that protons may control respiratory frequency by controlling the activity of HCN channels. Modulation of HCN channels by pHi may also be important in non-neuronal cell types. It was speculated that the motility of sperm cells may be controlled by up-regulation of the HCN4 channel because of intracellular alkalinization (18Seifert R. Scholten A. Gauss R. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Kaupp U.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9391-9396Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although we have not tested whether or not HCN4 is sensitive to shifts in pHi, the presence of a residue equivalent to His-321 in HCN4 is in favor of such a modulation. Finally, pHi may control the activity of HCN channels in heart. Such a regulation could be of particular importance under pathological conditions such as heart failure and myocardial infarction. During acute ischemia accompanying these diseases, CO2 production and the net production of protons shift pHi to values as low as 6.0 (42Carmeliet E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 70: 917-1017Crossref Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that inhibition of HCN channels by increases in H+ concentration could disturb pacemaker activity in sinoatrial node and other parts of the cardiac conduction tissue and, hence, contribute significantly to the generation of arrhythmia.

https://openalex.org/W2122305079,"The mouse multidrug resistance gene family consists of three genes (mdr1, mdr2, andmdr3) encoding P-glycoprotein. We show that the expression of mdr1 is increased at the transcriptional level upon treatment of the hepatoma cell line Hepa-1c1c7 with the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC). This increase is not observed in the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-defective TAOc1BPrc1 and the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt)-defective BPrc1 variants, demonstrating that the induction of mdr1 by 3-MC requires AhR·Arnt. We show that the mdr1 promoter (−1165 to +84) is able to activate the expression of a reporter gene in response to 3-MC in Hepa-1c1c7 but not in BPrc1 cells. Deletion analysis indicated that the region from −245 to −141 containscis-acting sequences mediating the induction, including a potential p53 binding sequence. 3-MC treatment of the cells increased the levels of p53 and induced p53 binding to the mdr1 promoter in an AhR·Arnt-dependent manner. Mutations in the p53 binding site abrogated induction of mdr1 by 3-MC, indicating that p53 binding to the mdr1 promoter is essential for the induction. Benzo(a)pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and AhR ligand, which, like 3-MC, is oxidized by metabolizing enzymes regulated by AhR·Arnt, also activated p53 and induced mdr1 transcription. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, an AhR ligand resistant to metabolic breakdown, had no effect. These results indicate that the transcriptional induction of mdr1 by 3-MC and benzo(a)pyrene is directly mediated by p53 but that the metabolic activation of these compounds into reactive species is necessary to trigger p53 activation. The ability of the anticancer drug and potent genotoxic agent daunorubicin to induce mdr1 independently of AhR·Arnt further supports the proposition thatmdr1 is transcriptionally up-regulated by p53 in response to DNA damage.

In cultured cells, MDR is frequently caused by the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), an integral membrane protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters and which functions as an energy-dependent efflux pump of cytotoxic drugs (1Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). Pgp is encoded by a small family of genes with two members in humans (MDR1 and MDR2/MDR3) and three in rodents (mdr1/mdr1b, mdr2, andmdr3/mdr1a) (1Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev.

Only one human gene (MDR1) and two rodent genes (mdr1/mdr1b and mdr3/mdr1a) can confer MDR upon overexpression in drug-sensitive cells (1Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). The different mdr genes and Pgp isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (1Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). In the mouse, mdr1 is expressed mostly in the adrenal cortex, kidney, and pregnant uterus,mdr2 in the liver at the canalicular face, andmdr3 in the intestine and to a lesser extent in the heart, liver, lung, and capillaries of the brain (3Croop J.M. Raymond M. Haber D. Devault A. Arceci R.J. Gros P. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Pgps are localized on the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining luminal spaces, suggesting that they function in normal tissues as transporters of toxic substances and/or specific endogenous cellular products (4Thiebaut F.

Knockout mice experiments have demonstrated a role for themdr3 gene in the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier and drug elimination and for the mdr2 gene in the transport of phospholipids in the bile (5Schinkel A.H.

No physiological function has been attributed to the mouse mdr1 gene so far, since knockoutmdr1 (−/−) mice display no obvious physiological abnormalities (7Schinkel A.H. Mayer U. Wagenaar E.

A number of factors have been found to modulate the level ofmdr gene expression in the liver. For example, high levels of MDR1 RNA have been found in human hepatocarcinomas, and overexpression of the mdr1 isoforms has also been observed in rodent liver during cholestasis, during regeneration following partial hepatectomy, during chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis, and following administration of various natural and synthetic xenobiotics (1Endicott J.A.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been shown that expression of the rat mdr1b gene is increased in liver cells in response to treatment with various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds, including 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC), and that this increased expression occurs at the transcriptional level (9Burt R.K. Thorgeirsson S.S. J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 1988; 80: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10Gant T.W. Silverman J.A. Bisgaard H.C. Burt R.K. Marino P.A. Thorgeirsson S.S. Mol.

PAHs are carcinogenic compounds arising from the incomplete combustion of organic matter and are widespread in the environment, including tobacco smoke and tar. PAHs such as 3-MC and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) as well as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) are specific inducers of genes coding for drug-metabolizing enzymes (DME), includingcyp1a1 and cyp1a2, that code for cytochromes P450 involved in metabolic oxidation (12Whitlock Jr., J.P. Okino S.T. Dong L. Ko H.P. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Ma Q. Li H. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). PAHs and TCDD bind in the cytoplasm to the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a member of the bHLH-PAS (basic helix-loop-helix Per-Arnt-Sim) family of transcription factors (12Whitlock Jr., J.P. Okino S.T. Dong L. Ko H.P. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Ma Q. Li H. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13Okey A.B. Riddick D.S. Harper P.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 226-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The ligand-bound AhR translocates to the nucleus, where it binds as a heterodimer with the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt; another bHLH-PAS protein) to specific cis-acting regulatory DNA sequences located in the promoter of its targets (known as AH-, dioxin-, or xenobiotic-responsive elements (or AHRE, DRE, or XRE, respectively)) to enhance their transcription (12Whitlock Jr., J.P.

Sci. 1994; 15: 226-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Given thatmdr1b expression is increased in liver cells in response to treatment with various PAHs, it was postulated that mdr1b may be under the control of the AhR (9Burt R.K. Thorgeirsson S.S. J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 1988; 80: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, studies failing to show mdr1 induction in the liver of mice treated with TCDD, one of the most potent agonists of the AhR, suggested thatmdr1 expression was not regulated by AhR (14Teeter L.D. Petersen D.D. Nebert D.W. Kuo M.T. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The involvement of AhR in the regulation of mdr1 has so far remained controversial. The mouse hepatoma cell lines Hepa-1c1c7 (wild type), TAOc1BPrc1 (AhR-defective), and BPrc1 (Arnt-defective) constitute a powerful experimental system to investigate the transcriptional regulation of different AhR·Arnt targets in response to xenobiotics (12Whitlock Jr., J.P. Okino S.T. Dong L. Ko H.P. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Ma Q. Li H. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The two mutant cell lines were derived as B(a)P-resistant variants of Hepa-1c1c7 and were identified based on their inability to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in response to TCDD treatment (15Miller A.G. Israel D. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3523-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TAOc1BPrc1 cells have a decreased level of AhR (∼10% of wild-type cells) and therefore decreased induction of thecyp1a1 promoter and lower aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in response to TCDD and other AhR ligands (15Miller A.G.

Israel D. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3523-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They have virtually no basal or inducible levels of cyp1a1 expression and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity (15Miller A.G. Israel D. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol.

In the present report, we have used this panel of cell lines to investigate the transcriptional regulation of the murinemdr1 gene by 3-MC and other xenobiotic compounds. Our results demonstrate that mdr1 is transcriptionally induced by 3-MC and B(a)P and that this induction is mediated by p53 but also requires AhR·Arnt. A model for the AhR·Arnt- and p53-mediated transactivation of mdr1 in response to genotoxic stress is proposed. Wild-type Hepa-1c1c7 and Hepa 1–6, AhR-defective TAOc1BPrc1, and Arnt-defective BPrc1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and maintained in culture under the conditions recommended by the ATCC. Chinese hamster ovary LR73 cell lines stably transfected with plasmid constructs carrying full-length cDNAs for the mouse mdr1, mdr2, ormdr3 genes (LR73 mdr1, LR73 mdr2, and LR73 mdr3, respectively; a gift from Dr. Philippe Gros, McGill University, Montréal, Canada) were grown as described elsewhere (19Devault A. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1652-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 20Buschman E. Arceci R.J. Croop J.M. Che M. Arias I.M. Housman D.E. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18093-18099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For inductions, cells at ∼50% confluence were exposed to different concentrations of xenobiotics for various periods of time (the exact conditions for each experiment are indicated in the figure legends). 3-MC, B(a)P, and daunorubicin were obtained from Sigma, and TCDD was obtained from the Centre d'expertise en analyze environnementale du Québec (Laval, Canada). Stock solutions of 3-MC (5 mm) and B(a)P (25 mm) were prepared in Me2SO, and the stock solutions of daunorubicin (1 mg/ml) were prepared in water. TCDD was obtained in n-nonane at a concentration of 50 μg/ml and was stored at room temperature. Stock solutions of 3-MC, B(a)P, and daunorubicin were stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was prepared from 3-MC-treated and untreated hepatocytes as well as from the LR73 mdr1, LR73 mdr2, and LR73 mdr3 cell lines by homogenizing the cells in a solution containing guanidium hydrochloride (6 m) followed by sequential ethanol precipitation, as described previously (21Raymond M. Rose E. Housman D.E. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The plasmid constructed to detect the mdr1 RNA consisted of a 165-bp Bam HI fragment isolated from the mdr1 cDNA (positions 1926–2090 relative to the ATG initiation codon (22Gros P. Croop J. Housman D. Cell. 1986; 47: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar)), blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and cloned into plasmid pGEM-7Z (Promega, Madison, WI) at the Sma I site, giving plasmid pmdr1-G7. This plasmid was linearized with Eco RI and used as a template to synthesize an antisense mdr1 probe using SP6 RNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pKX10–3Z plasmid consisting of anXba I–Kpn I mouse β-actin cDNA fragment (positions 724–969 in the β-actin cDNA) cloned into pGEM-3Z at the Xba I and Kpn I sites (kindly provided by Dr. Rashmi Kothary, Institut du cancer de Montréal, Montréal, Canada) was used to generate a control actin probe. pKX10–3Z was linearized with Xba I and used to synthesize an antisense actin RNA probe with T7 RNA polymerase. The riboprobes were synthesized in the presence of [α-32P]UTP, and the RNase protection assay was performed according to standard protocols (23Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). The run-on experiment was performed essentially as described by Fisher et al. (24Fisher J.M. Jones K.W. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Carcinog. 1989; 1: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nuclei were isolated from Hepa-1c1c7 cells treated with Me2SO or with 3-MC (5 μm) for 48 h and were used to label nascent RNAs with [α-32P]UTP. Plasmids pVT101-U/mdr1, carrying the full-length mouse mdr1 cDNA (25Ruetz S. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12277-12284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); pmP1450–3′, carrying a 1.2-kb Pst I cDNA fragment overlapping part of the mouse cyp1a1 cDNA (26Kimura S. Gonzalez F.J. Nebert D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10705-10713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (obtained from the ATCC); and pKX10–3Z were linearized withStu I, Bam HI, and Xba I, respectively. The linearized plasmids were denatured, immobilized in duplicate onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized with the [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNAs for 48 h at 65 °C. The membranes were washed and exposed for 7 days with two intensifying screens. Slot blotting was performed as previously described (21Raymond M. Rose E. Housman D.E. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). RNA samples (10 μg) were denatured in 7× SSC-7.5% formaldehyde for 15 min at 65 °C and applied to a nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe). Detection of specific RNAs was performed by hybridization at 65 °C in 0.5 m NaPO4, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA with 32P-labeled DNA probes. Themdr1 probe was a 4.2-kb Sph I–Eco RI fragment overlapping the full-length mouse mdr1 cDNA, isolated from plasmid pGEM7/mdr1 (a gift from Dr. Philippe Gros, McGill University, Montréal); the cyp1a1 probe was a 1.2-kbPst I fragment isolated from plasmid pmP1450–3′; and the actin probe was a 245-bp Xba I–Kpn I fragment isolated from pKX10–3Z. The membranes were washed twice at 65 °C with a solution containing 40 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2, 5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and twice with a solution containing 40 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2, 5% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA before autoradiography. Plasmid pMcat5.9 consists of a 482-bp DNA fragment containing the dioxin-responsive elements of the cyp1a1 gene cloned upstream of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter and the CAT gene (24Fisher J.M. Jones K.W. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Carcinog. 1989; 1: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Allan Okey, University of Toronto). Plasmids pmdr1, p-452, p-245, p-141, and p-93 (previously referred to as pSacICAT, pExo6CAT, pExo2CAT, pExo1CAT, and pAluCAT, respectively) have been described elsewhere (27Raymond M. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6036-6040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mdr1 promoter sequence in these constructs ends at position +84 with respect to the transcription start site (27Raymond M. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6036-6040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To produce the p53 mutant constructs, pM1 and pM2, plasmid pSBM13 was used. This plasmid consists of a 1.2-kbSac I–Hin dIII mdr1 promoter fragment (positions −1165 to +84) cloned into M13mp18. Single-stranded DNA was prepared from pSBM13 and used as a template to perform site-directed mutagenesis of the p53 binding site, using the mutant oligonucleotides M1 5′-TACCTGAATACATAAAGACA and M2 5′-CGTAAAGATAAATCTATGTA (the base changes are shown in boldface type). The resulting M1 and M2 mdr1 promoter fragments were then excised from pSBM13 with Sac I and Hin dIII, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and cloned into plasmid pCAT at the Hin dIII site also blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, yielding plasmids pM1 and pM2. The presence of the mutations in the resulting constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were plated at a density of 8 × 105/60-mm plate and transfected on the following day with 10 μg of plasmid DNA, using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After incubation with the DNA precipitate for 16 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and supplied with fresh medium containing the different xenobiotics. After 48 h, the cells were collected. Cell extracts were prepared, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). CAT activities were assayed by standard protocols as described previously, using 2 μg of proteins (27Raymond M. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6036-6040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (30Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.6 mm EDTA and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin and swelled on ice for 15 min. Subsequently, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 were added, and the tubes were vortexed vigorously. The nuclear pellets were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 μl of cold buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) in the presence of protease inhibitors. The suspensions were shaken vigorously at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides overlapping the potential p53 binding site in the mdr1 promoter (5′-GAACACGTAAAGACAAGTCTAT) and the p53 consensus sequence in the p21 waf1/cip1 promoter (5′-GAACATGTCCCAACATGTTGAG) (31el Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar) were end-labeled with γ-32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to their respective complementary oligonucleotides to generate double-stranded probes. The EMSA was performed with 5 μg of nuclear extracts in a binding mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% Ficoll, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 20,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe. The binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 15 min. Where needed, 1 μg of the monoclonal anti-p53 antibody pAb421 (32Harlow E. Crawford L.V. Pim D.C. Williamson N.M. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 861-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Calbiochem) or of the polyclonal anti-Jun or anti-Skn-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. The complexes were separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE (90 mm Tris, 65 mm boric acid, 2.5 mmEDTA, pH 8.0) at 200 V. The gels were exposed to XAR films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 16 h with two intensifying screens at −80 °C. Total proteins from 3-MC- or Me2SO-treated Hepa-1c1c7 and BPrc1 cells were extracted in ice-cold buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Total proteins (75 μg/sample) or nuclear extracts (30 μg/sample) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% acrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed with the monoclonal anti-p53 antibody pAb421 (32Harlow E. Crawford L.V. Pim D.C. Williamson N.M. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 861-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Calbiochem) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Immune complexes were revealed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride substrates as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). We have used an RNase protection assay to study the expression of mdr1 in the hepatoma cell line Hepa-1c1c7 upon exposure to 3-MC (Fig. 1). Anmdr1-specific riboprobe was prepared by cloning into pGEM7-Zf a mouse mdr1 cDNA fragment overlapping the linker region of the protein, this domain displaying the lowest sequence homology among the three mouse mdr cDNAs (21Raymond M. Rose E. Housman D.E. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). When tested with RNA prepared from LR73 stable transfectants expressing each of the three mouse mdr cDNAs, the mdr1 riboprobe was found to recognize the mdr1 RNA but not themdr2 or mdr3 RNA, thus confirming its specificity (Fig. 1, top right). The mdr1 probe was then used with RNA from Hepa-1c1c7 cells treated or not with 3-MC (Fig. 1, top left). This experiment showed that the amount of mdr1 RNA detected is very low in untreated cells but is strongly increased in 3-MC-treated cells, demonstrating that expression of the mouse mdr1 gene is induced by 3-MC treatment. The use of an actin probe confirmed that equal quantities of RNA were used in the assay (Fig. 1, bottom). A similar experiment performed with mdr2- and mdr3-specific riboprobes showed that the expression of these genes is not induced under such conditions, demonstrating that the induction ofmdr1 expression by 3-MC is isoform-specific (data not shown). A nuclear run-on experiment was performed to determine whethermdr1 induction by 3-MC occurs at the transcriptional level (Fig. 2). In addition to the mousemdr1 cDNA, cDNAs for the mouse cyp1a1 gene (known to be transcriptionally regulated by 3-MC (12Whitlock Jr., J.P. Okino S.T. Dong L. Ko H.P. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Ma Q. Li H. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)) and for the actin gene were also included as positive and negative controls, respectively. The data in Fig. 2 show that 3-MC induces an increase in the rate of mdr1 mRNA synthesis, indicating that 3-MC acts at the transcriptional level to induce mdr1 gene expression in Hepa-1c1c7 cells. To determine whether the increase in mdr1 expression in response to 3-MC exposure is AhR·Arnt-mediated, we analyzed the mdr1 RNA levels upon 3-MC treatment in two wild-type hepatoma cell lines Hepa-1c1c7 and Hepa 1–6 and in two variant cell lines derived from Hepa-1c1c7, TAOc1BPrc1 (AhR-defective) and BPrc1 (Arnt-defective) (15Miller A.G. Israel D. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3523-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.3). As controls, we also analyzed the level of cyp1a1 and actin expression under the same conditions (Fig. 3, middle and right, respectively). This experiment showed that mdr1 is expressed at low levels in the four cell lines in the absence of 3-MC induction (Fig. 3, left panel). Upon 3-MC treatment, the expression of mdr1 is induced in the two wild-type hepatoma cell lines (by ∼5-fold), this induction being completely abrogated in the AhR-defective or in the Arnt-defective variants (Fig. 3,left panel). The actin control probe confirmed that equal amounts of RNA had been applied to the membrane (Fig. 3,right panel). These data clearly demonstrate that the induction of mdr1 in response to 3-MC requires an intact AhR·Arnt complex, like cyp1a1 (Fig. 3, middle) (12Whitlock Jr., J.P. Okino S.T. Dong L. Ko H.P. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Ma Q. Li H. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To determine if regulatory sequences responsible for mdr1 induction by 3-MC are present in the promoter region of the gene, plasmid pmdr1, consisting of a 1.2-kb Sac I–Hin dIII DNA fragment overlapping the mdr1 promoter region (positions −1165 to +84 with respect to the transcription start site (27Raymond M.

Significant enhancement of TNF receptor-1 (CD120a)- and, to a lesser extent, Fas (CD95)-mediated apoptosis was observed when overexpressing the C-terminal TRAF1 fragment in HEK293T and HT1080 cells. The same fragment was capable of potently suppressing TNF receptor-1- and TRAF2-mediated nuclear factor-κB activation in reporter gene assays, providing a potential mechanism for the enhancement of TNF-mediated apoptosis. Cell death induced by other death receptor-independent stimuli such as cisplatin, staurosporine, and UV irradiation did not result in cleavage of TRAF1, and overexpression of the C-terminal TRAF1 fragment did not enhance cell death in these cases. TRAF1 cleavage was markedly reduced in cells that contain little procaspase-8 protein, suggesting that this apical protease in the TNF/Fas death receptor pathway is largely responsible.

In contrast to TRAF2, -5, and -6, the TRAF1 protein lacks a conserved N-terminal RING domain found in TRAF family proteins and fails to induce NF-κB or to activate stress kinases when overexpressed in cells.

A recent report in which a N-terminal truncated TRAF1 protein was overexpressed demonstrated suppression of TNF-mediated NF-κB and JNK activation (38Schwenzer R. Siemienski K. Liptay S. Schubert G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19368-19374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting thattrans-dominant inhibitory mutants of TRAF1 interfere with TNF signaling. However, overexpression of full-length TRAF1 also reportedly can suppress NF-κB induction by TNF, interleukin-1, TRAF2, and TRAF6 (39Carpentier I. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Conversely, TRAF1 interactions with LMP-1 have been implicated in induction rather than suppression of NF-κB (40Devergne O.

Several of the TRAFs play roles in regulating apoptosis (41Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3261-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 42Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The best established mechanism for apoptosis regulation by TRAFs is through NF-κB, although contributions by JNK-activating kinases and Akt may also play a role in some circumstances (18Wong B.R.

Interestingly, some TNF family cytokine receptors such as TNFR1 simultaneously stimulate pathways for apoptosis induction via receptor-associated proteins that activate caspase family cell death proteases (particularly caspase-8) and pathways for suppression via NF-κB (reviewed in Refs. 41Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3261-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 49Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.

Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Thus, the balance of these two signaling pathways dictates whether cells ultimately live or die when stimulated through TNFR1. Interestingly, although TRAF1 may influence apoptosis indirectly through modulation of NF-κB-inducible gene expression,TRAF1 was also identified together with TRAF2,cIAP1, and cIAP2 as NF-κB-inducible genes that may form a protein complex capable of directly blocking caspase-8 activation induced by TNFR1 (51Wang C.-Y. Mayo M. Korneluk R. Goeddel D. Baldwin A. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). In this regard, TRAF1 binds the BIR domain region of IAPs cIAP1 and cIAP2 (52Rothe M. Pan M.-G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Finally, experiments with TRAF1 transgenic mice have revealed a role for TRAF1 in inhibition of antigen-induced programmed cell death of CD8-positive T-cells (56Speiser D.E. Lee S.Y. Wong B. Arron J. Santana A. Kong Y.Y. Ohashi P.S. Choi W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence that TRAF1 is a substrate of caspase family proteases that are specifically activated by TNF family death receptors, but not by other types of stimuli that primarily activate an alternative mitochondrion-dependent pathway for caspase activation. Interestingly, one of the TRAF1 cleavage products can function as a suppressor of NF-κB activation induced by TNFR1 and TRAF2 and thus could potentially play a role in committing TNF-stimulated cells to an apoptotic demise. The findings demonstrate differences in the repertoire of substrates cleaved by caspases that become activated by alternative apoptosis pathways. Plasmids containing cDNAs encompassing the complete open reading frames of human TRAF1(pSG5-TRAF1), human TRAF2(pcDNA3-HA-TRAF2), human TRAF3b(pcDNAHA-TRAF3b), human TRAF6(pcDNA3-Myc-TRAF6), human TNFR-I(CD120a), and human Fas/CD95(pCMV-Fas) have been described previously (11Leo E.

The cleavage fragments of TRAF1 (Fragments I and II) were generated by standard two-step polymerase chain reaction methods and subcloned intoEcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3-Myc. Non-cleavable TRAF1 was prepared by mutating Asp163 to alanine by QuickChangeTM site-directed polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis as described previously (57Papworth C. Braman J. Wright D.A. Stratagies. 1996; 9: 3-4Crossref Google Scholar). The promoter-containing reporter gene plasmid pUC13-4xNF-κB-Luc, which contains four tandem human immunodeficiency virus NF-κB response elements and the minimal c-fos promoter, has been described (58Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar). The caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone was purchased from Alexis, TNF-α from Genzyme Corp., and anti-Fas antibody CH-11 from Medical Biological Laboratories Co., LTD (Nagoya, Japan). Cycloheximide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and staurosporine were obtained from Sigma. TRAF cDNAs in pcDNA3 werein vitro transcribed/translated withl-[35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using reticulocyte lysates (Promega), and then 2 μl of lysate were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 100 μl of caspase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mmdithiothreitol) containing recombinant active caspases at 1 μm. Proteins were eluted in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE/autoradiography analysis. Recombinant caspases were prepared as described previously (59Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and their active concentration was determined by titration against the unmethylated benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone derivative purchased from Bachem. Caspase activities were assayed as previously described (59Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 60Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Briefly, caspase activity was assayed at 37 °C in 100 μl of caspase buffer containing the indicated fluorogenic peptide at 100 μm. Activity was measured continuously over the indicated times by the release of fluorogenic AFC from the peptide substitute acetyl-DEVD-AFC using a Molecular Devices fluorometer in the kinetic mode and a 405–510-nm filter pair. To assess caspase activity generated in cells, 10 μl of packed cells were lysed by addition of 20 μl of buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.25% Triton X-100. Suspensions were vortexed briefly and normalized for protein concentration, and 2 μl of the normalized lysates were assayed for caspase activity in 100 μl of caspase buffer containing 100 μm DEVD-AFC at 37 °C. MCF-7-Fas and BJAB cells were a kind gift of Vishva Dixit. HEK293T and HT1080 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Wild-type and caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells were generously provided by J. Blenis (61Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). MCF-7-Fas, HEK293T, and HT1080 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 1 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Jurkat and BJAB cells were similarly cultured, except that RPMI 1640 medium was used. Cisplatin, adriamycin (doxorubicin), etoposide, and staurosporine were added to cultures as indicated. HT1080 and MCF-7-Fas cells were transfected with Superfect (QIAGEN Inc.) in six-well plates and treated with various concentrations of anti-Fas antibody (usually 100 ng/ml). Lysates were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For NF-κB reporter gene assays, 293N cells at 60–80% confluency in 12-well plates were transfected using a cationic lipid reagent (Superfect) with various amounts of plasmid DNA, including 0.1 μg of pUC13-4xNF-κB-Luc and 0.1 μg of pCMV-βgal. After 36 h, cells were suspended in 0.1 ml of Promega lysis buffer. Lysates were measured for luciferase activity using a luminometer (EG&G Berthold) and Promega luciferase kits, normalizing relative to β-galactosidase activity (11Leo E. Welsh K. Matsuzawa S. Zapata J.M. Kitada S. Mitchell R. Ely K.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22414-22422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, cell lysates were normalized for total protein content (50 μg), separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gels), and transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by transverse electrophoresis. Membranes were pre-blocked in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% (v/v) skim milk and 1% (v/v) goat serum (Sigma) for 1 h and incubated overnight with primary antibody (at 1:1000, v/v) in the same solution. After washing three times with Tris-buffered saline, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the same solution containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000, v/v; Bio-Rad). Membranes were washed again three times with Tris-buffered saline, and proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-TRAF1 (SC-1831), anti-TRAF2 (C-20), and anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at 1:1000 (v/v) dilution. In vitrotranslated, 35S-labeled TRAF1 was incubated with recombinant active caspase-3 and -6–10, and in vitrocleavage was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Caspase-3, -6, -8, and -10, but not caspase-7 and -9, cleaved TRAF1 under these conditions, generating two distinct fragments (Fig. 1 A) of ∼28 and 22 kDa. The cleavage pattern revealed identical sizes for the fragments, independent of the particular caspase employed, suggesting the presence of a single cleavage site. By taking into account the size of the generated fragments, a160LEVD163 motif within TRAF1 appeared to be the most likely target for cleavage. Mutation of aspartic acid 163 to alanine confirmed this hypothesis and led to a non-cleavable form of TRAF1 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, a control mutation (L160A) did not prevent caspase-mediated cleavage of TRAF1 (data not shown). To investigate whether TRAF1 cleavage occurs in cells, the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 was transiently transfected with a Myc-tagged TRAF1 expression plasmid. After inducing caspase activation by adding anti-Fas antibody (CH-11), cells were lysed at various times, and cell lysates were prepared for immunoblot analysis. Within 3 h after Fas stimulation, a faint band representing the N-terminal fragment of TRAF1 became detectable. Between 6 and 12 h, the cleaved TRAF1 product increased in relative amount, whereas the full-length ∼49-kDa TRAF1 protein was depleted. The cleavage of TRAF1 in Fas-stimulated HT1080 cells was completely prevented by preincubation (∼30 min) with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone, indicating that cleavage of TRAF1 in mammalian cells is caspase-dependent. In contrast to wild-type TRAF1, the TRAF1(D163A) protein was not cleaved in Fas-stimulated HT1080 cells, even during late stages of apoptosis when most of the HT1080 cells had become rounded, shrunken, and detached from the culture dishes (12–18 h). To investigate whether other TRAF molecules undergo cleavage by caspases in Fas-stimulated HT1080 cells, TRAF2–6 were transfected into the cells in similar experiments. No visible cleavage or degradation of the full-length TRAF molecules was observed (Fig.2 and data not shown). Similar observations were made in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, a caspase-3- and -10-deficient cell line (62Talanian R. Yang X. Turbov J. Seth P. Ghayur T. Casiano C. Orth K. Froelich C. J. Exp.

Interestingly, cleavage of TRAF1 was evident in these cells even before addition of anti-Fas antibody (CH-11) (Fig.2 B), presumably reflecting constitutive caspase activation in these cells as a result of overexpression of Fas. Addition of anti-Fas antibody led to rapid cleavage of the remaining wild-type TRAF1. The non-cleavable TRAF1(D163A) mutant as well as wild-type TRAF2 were not cleaved in Fas-stimulated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained when HT1080 and MCF-7 cells were stimulated with TNF plus cycloheximide (data not shown), suggesting that TRAF1 cleavage occurs in response to activation of this death receptor, in addition to Fas (CD95). To determine whether the same effect can be seen for endogenous TRAF1, we stimulated the human T-cell line Jurkat with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the human B-cell line BJAB with CD40. These stimuli result in NF-κB activation and increased expression of endogenous TRAF1, a NF-κB-inducible gene (38Schwenzer R. Siemienski K. Liptay S. Schubert G. Peters N. Scheurich P. Schmid R.M.

Inducing apoptosis with either anti-Fas antibody or TNF-α (+cycloheximide) led to the complete disappearance of endogenous full-length TRAF1 within 24 h. Cleavage of TRAF1 was evident within 6 h in these experiments (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, apoptosis induction by a death receptor-independent stimulus, staurosporine (10 μm) (66Matsuyama S. Llopi J. Deveraux Q. Tsien R. Reed J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), did not result in TRAF1 cleavage (data not shown). To investigate the possible functional significance of the cleavage of TRAF1, we coexpressed TRAF1(D163A), TRAF1 Fragment I (N-terminal), and TRAF1 Fragment II (C-terminal) together with TNFR1 (CD120a) or Fas expression plasmids. The levels of TRAF1 and TRAF1 mutants produced by transient transfection were comparable to those expressed endogenously in lymphoid cell lines (data not shown), arguing that the levels of proteins are within physiologically relevant ranges. Whereas TRAF1 and the non-cleavable TRAF1(D163A) had no remarkable influence on TNFR1 or Fas cell death, TRAF1 Fragment II led to significant enhancement of TNF-mediated apoptosis (Fig.4 A). This increase in apoptosis was accompanied by elevations in caspase activity, as measured in lysates of these cells (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). None of the TRAF constructs when expressed alone had any significant influence on cell viability in the absence of TNFR1 or Fas. Coexpression of TRAF1 Fragment II with Fas also resulted in enhanced apoptosis (Fig. 4 C), although the effect of TRAF1 Fragment II was less potent for Fas than for TNFR1. Similar results were obtained in experiments using HT1080 cells (data not shown). Since TRAF1 has been implicated in regulation of TNF-mediated NF-κB activation and is known to bind TRAF2, the effect of the TRAF1 fragments on NF-κB induction was investigated. No significant NF-κB induction was observed in cells overexpressing TRAF1, TRAF1(D163A), or the TRAF1 fragments. Cotransfecting TRAF1 or TRAF1 Fragment II with TNFR1 in 293 cells resulted in dose-dependent suppression of TNFR1-mediated"

We have previously shown that 9G8 primary transcripts are subjected to alternative splicing by excision/retention of intron 3 and to a tissue specific modulation. Because both 5′- and 3′-splice sites of intron 3 appear to be suboptimal in vertebrates, we tested the 9G8 intron 3 as a novel model system of alternative splicing. By using an in vitro approach and a mutational analysis, we have identified two purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) located in exon 4 and a (GAA)3 enhancer located in exon 3. These elements act in concert to promote efficient splicing activation both in vitro and in vivo. Titration experiments with an excess of exonic enhancers or SR-specific RNA targets strongly suggest that SR proteins are specifically involved in the activation process. Although ASF/SF2 was expected to interact the most efficiently with ESE according to the enhancer sequences, UV cross-linking coupled or not to immunopurification demonstrates that 9G8 is highly recruited by the three ESE, followed by SC35. In contrast, ASF/SF2 only binds significantly to the (GAA)3 motif. S100 complementation experiments with individual SR proteins demonstrate that only 9G8 is able to fully restore splicing of intron 3. These results, and the fact that the exon 3 and 4 ESE sequences are conserved in vertebrates, strongly suggest that the alternative splicing of intron 3 represents an important step in the regulation of the expression of 9G8. 9G8 protein belongs to the conserved serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, whose members exhibit multiple functions in constitutive and alternative splicing.

The differential recognition and alternative choice of 5′- and 3′-splice sites, which also represent the earliest events of the spliceosome formation, may be under developmental, tissue, or sex-specific controls. These regulations are predicted to require bothcis- and trans-acting factors, which modulate either positively or negatively the alternative splicing process (3Chabot B.

The study of many alternative splicing systems has allowed the identification and characterization of cis-acting elements, which activate or repress competing splicing reactions. Among them, the best characterized are the exonic splicing enhancers (ESE),1 which stimulate the use of nearby weak 3′-splice sites (for review, see Ref. 5Wang J. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet.

However, much less is known about the trans-acting factors and the precise mechanisms responsible for alternative splicing regulation. Important progress has been made in Drosophilamodels, especially for the genes involved in the sex determination pathway for which the role of several specific trans-acting factors, namely, Sex-lethal (Sxl), Transformer (Tra) and Transformer-2 (Tra-2) have also been well documented (for review, see Refs. 2Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 6McKeown M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, in vertebrate systems, the advances on the identification of the cellular factors involved in splicing regulation are far more limited. A family of essential splicing factors, the serine/arginine (SR)-rich proteins, represents one of the attractive candidates for the activation and regulation of the splice site choice in the alternative splicing process (7Fu X.D. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 8Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 9Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR proteins contain one or two N-terminal ribonucleoprotein-type RNA binding domains, which are required for RNA binding, and a C-terminal arginine/serine (RS) domain, which may promote protein-protein interactions with other components of the splicing machinery. The SR proteins are required for the constitutive splicing reaction, mainly for the formation of the early prespliceosomal complex by stabilizing U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein at the 5′-splice site and in spliceosome formation, most likely by mediating interactions between U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein and U2AF, bound to the 5′- and 3′-splice sites, respectively (7Fu X.D. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 8Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 10Reed R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). SR proteins have been shown to intervene in alternative splicing both in vitro and in vivo in a concentration-dependent manner, by modulating 5′-splice site choice in pre-mRNA containing competing 5′-splice sites (11Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B. Science. 1993; 260: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 12Fu X.D. Mayeda A. Maniatis T. Krainer A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They also participate in splicing activation of introns containing weak 3′-splice sites by binding to purine-rich ESE (7Fu X.D. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 9Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in splicing repression (15Kanopka A. Muhlemann O. Akusjarvi G. Nature. 1996; 381: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To better understand the basis of their specific functions in alternative splicing regulation, analyses of the SR protein abilities to recognize specific RNA targets have been performed. High affinity RNA targets have been defined by a conventional SELEX approach for ASF/SF2, SC35, 9G8, SRp20, and SRp40 (16Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 17Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Tacke R. Chen Y. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Specific targets for SR species can contain purine-rich sequences, for ASF/SF2 for instance (16Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) or pyrimidine-rich sequences, for SC35 or SRp20 (17Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Importantly, most of these high affinity targets act as splicing enhancers under the control of the SR species, which specifically recognizes them (16Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 17Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). By using a complementary approach based on functional SELEX, exonic enhancers have also been identified, with more degenerate sequences that are specific of the appropriate SR protein, validating both conventional and functional SELEX approaches (19Liu H.X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 20Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1705-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Liu H.X. Chew S.L. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Most of these prototypical motifs represent strong enhancers, which are subject to regulation according to their location in the pre-mRNA and/or their involvement in a more complex activation region. Such elements, for which interacting SR species have been unambiguously defined, include the purine-rich element of the doublesex(dsx) exon 4, recognized by ASF/SF2 (22Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2089-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); the Pu1 and Pu2 motifs of the bidirectional splicing enhancer of the adenoviral E1A gene, which interact with 9G8; and ASF/SF2 or SC35, respectively (23Bourgeois C.F. Popielarz M. Hildwein G. Stevenin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7347-7356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and a constitutive splicing enhancer identified in the β globin exon 2, specifically recognized by SC35 (24Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, as suggested recently (25Dirksen W.P. Li X. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29170-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it is likely that SR proteins may also be involved in alternative splicing regulation by interacting with multiple cis-acting elements, which present only moderate affinity for one specific SR species, exhibit cross-reactivity with several SR species, or require some accessory factors to be active. Because a limited number of alternative splicing regulation examples are well established, it is important to analyze other models to get additional information. During a previous study (26Popielarz M. Cavaloc Y. Mattei M.G. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17830-17835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) we identified and characterized several 9G8 mRNA isoforms in human fetal tissues. Among them, the 2.4-kb isoform, containing the entire intron 3, was predominant in kidney, whereas the classic 1.4-kb mRNA isoform was predominant in liver, suggesting that a tissue-specific modulation of intron 3 splicing takes place. Further studies of intron 3 alternative splicing as a model system appeared to be interesting for several aspects. First, intron 3 of the 9G8 gene exhibits the hallmarks of an alternative intron (see also “Results”). There are only a few examples of regulated excision of introns, and the best characterized example is that of the intron 3 of the P element in Drosophila whose regulation does not involve SR species (27Siebel C.W. Admon A. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Second, among the SR protein family, the transcripts of ASF/SF2 (28Ge H. Zuo P. Manley J.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), SRp55, SRp40, and SRp30c (29Screaton G.R. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Bell M.V. Plebanski M. Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4336-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), or SRp20 (30Jumaa H. Guenet J.L. Nielsen P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3116-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have also been shown to undergo alternative splicing. Only the alternative splicing of SRp20, which occurs by inclusion/skipping of exon 4, has been analyzed in details, but the precise identification of the cis-acting elements has not yet been carried out (31Jumaa H. Nielsen P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5077-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Finally, as in the case of the SRp20 gene for which the inclusion of exon 4 is expected to lead to the synthesis of a SRp20 truncated for an important part of the RS domain, the retention of the intron 3 in the 9G8 mRNA should allow the synthesis of a putative 9G8 isoform, which preserves only a reduced part of the RS domain (26Popielarz M. Cavaloc Y. Mattei M.G. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17830-17835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the modulation of absolute levels of the whole SR species, the alternative splicing of the 9G8 intron 3 could result in the synthesis of shorter isoforms with particular properties in splicing regulation. Because the 5′- and 3′-splice sites of 9G8 intron 3 are intrinsically weak, we have focused our study on the cis-acting elements that control the activation of these splice sites, as well as thetrans-acting factors that mediate the activation effect. We have identified strong exonic elements in exons 3 and 4, which are absolutely required for the splicing of intron 3. Moreover, we show that 9G8 is primarily involved in the splicing activation mechanism. Plasmids encoding the intron 3 pre-mRNA substrates are derived from an initial construct in which a 1118-bp SphI/XmnI fragment of the human 9G8 gene containing the last 144 bp of exon 3, 875 bp of intron 3, exon 4, and the first 23 bp of intron 4 was cloned between theSphI and HincII sites of pGEM 3Zf+ plasmid (Promega). The exon 3-exon 4 (E3-E4) construct is derived from the previous wild-type minigene by generating two deletions, internal to the intron 3, which reduce its size to 469 bp. The first is aSpeI/EcoRV deletion to remove 162 bp; the second is created by an opening at the NcoI site, followed by a digestion with the exonuclease Bal31, filling-in and rejoining of the ends. In addition, an NheI site was created in the middle of exon 4 to allow us to modify easily the exon 4 sequences. The mutated exon 4 E3-E4 constructions are made by the replacement of one or both halves of the exon 4 with oligonucleotides generating the mPuA, mPuB, ΨA, or ΨB sequences (see Fig. 2 for the exact sequences). The constructs mutated at the exon 3 (GAA)3enhancer were generated by two strategies. In the first, we created short deletions by an S1 nuclease digestion at the level of aBspMI site occurring 8 bp upstream of the exon 3/intron 3 junction. A 5-bp deletion (construct ΔI) or a 6-bp deletion was obtained (see Fig. 3 A). In a second strategy, the (GAA)3 sequence was substituted for a SpeI site by PCR-based mutagenesis, creating the ΔII construct (see Fig.3 A). Short oligonucleotides were inserted in theSpeI site to recreate one (GAA)3 motif (in the ΔII+(GAA)3 construct) or two (GAA)3 motifs in the ΔII+(GAA)6 construct. Primer sequences and further details are available on request.Figure 3The (GAA)3 motif in exon 3 is required for efficient splicing of downstream intron 3.

The first construct was obtained from the E3ΔII-E4 construct in which we changed the 5′-splice site sequence AG‖GTATTT to AG‖GTAAGT using a PCR approach with the appropriate oligonucleotides. By the same method, we changed the 3′-splice site sequence AACTTGAAAAATAG‖ to AACTTTTTTTATAG‖ for the cons. 5′3′-E3-E4 construct, and the exon 4 length was decreased by aXbaI digestion before in vitro transcription to obtain an enhancerless exon of 14 nt long. All in vivoconstructs were obtained by insertion of theHindIII/EcoRI fragments from the above constructs between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the pXJ42 plasmid (32Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). All clones were verified by sequencing. To synthesize the RNA competitors corresponding to sequences of wild-type or mutated exon 4 halves, paired oligonucleotides were introduced between the KpnI/XbaI sites of the Bluescript SK vector (Stratagene). The (GAA)3 RNA competitor, which contains the last 21 nt of exon 3 and the first G of intron 3, was obtained in the same manner. Constructs for expressing the ASF/SF2 (sequence A10: GCACAGGACGAAGCUGCACC), SC35 (sequence 7: AGGCGCAGUAGGGUAUGCUG), and 9G8 (sequence 102: GACAACGACGACGACUAGAA) competitor RNA were previously described (17Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Human and mouse multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed with human or mouse full-length cDNA of 9G8, respectively, as well as with human or mouse intron 3 probes as previously described (26Popielarz M. Cavaloc Y. Mattei M.G. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17830-17835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The approximate size of the various species was determined according to the migration of RNA markers. For UV cross-linking, 3 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract, S100 extract, or SR protein preparation were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature in a medium containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 25 mm creatine phosphate, 0.76 mm ATP, 8–10% glycerol, and 100 ng of Escherichia coli tRNA, in a 10-μl volume. Interactions between proteins and RNA (400,000 cpm of [α-32P]ATP-labeled transcript) were performed in the same medium as above, with addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 30 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, and 10 units of RNasin for 15 min at room temperature in a 15-μl volume. The reaction mixtures were then exposed to UV light (254 nm) for 10 min and subsequently treated with RNases (250 ng of RNase A, 100 units of RNase T1), for 1 h at 37 °C. Aliquots of the assays were then analyzed directly or immunopurified with monoclonal antibodies directed against ASF/SF2 or 9G8 or polyclonal antibody against SC35 as previously described (17Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Each antibody recognizes its corresponding SR protein specifically. After dilution of the assays to a volume of 100 μl with IP buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), the antibodies prebound to protein G-Sepharose were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the proteins bound to the Sepharose were eluted with the 2× SDS loading buffer, heated, and then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% gel. In vitro splicing assays with 7 fmol of E3-E4 and mutated E3-E4 transcripts were performed as previously described (23Bourgeois C.F. Popielarz M. Hildwein G. Stevenin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7347-7356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Schmitt P. Gattoni R. Keohavong P. Stevenin J. Cell. 1987; 50: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with 10 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract supplemented with 2 μl of cytoplasmic S100 extract in the presence of 48 mm KCl and 2.6 mmMgCl2 and the basic components of the splicing reaction. Complementation assays were done with 9 μl of S100 fraction supplemented with 1.5 μl of nuclear extract in the presence of 60 mm KCl and 2.6 mm MgCl2. Different amounts of baculovirus-purified recombinant proteins (17Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) were added to the transcript. Titrations assays were done in the presence of excess of cold RNA competitor sequences. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing 9G8, ASF/SF2, SC35, or SRp20 and the purification of the individual SR proteins were as described previously (17Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). At the end of the purification step, all proteins were dialyzed against buffer D (34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented containing 2.5% fetal calf serum or 4.5 g of glucose per liter and 10% calf serum, respectively. Cells (∼1 × 106/60-mm plate) were transfected using the CaCl2 procedure according to a previous study (35Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), with 0.5 μg of reporter construct and 9.5 μg of carrier pBluescript-SK plasmid DNA. After 14 h at 37 °C in 2% of CO2, the medium was replaced with fresh medium and the cells were placed at 37 °C in 5% of CO2. Approximately 10–15% of cells were transfected, as confirmed by cotransfection of a lacZ-expressing vector. At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and DNase-treated. Reverse transcription was carried out on 1.5 μg of total RNA, using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), for 1 h at 42 °C. Two specific primers were used for the analysis of the splicing reaction by PCR. Primers sequences were: 5′-AACCATTATAAGCTGCAAT-3′ for the RTase reaction and PCR and 5′-GTACCCTCGAGAAGCTTGCATG-3′, specific for the expression vector, for the PCR. The cycle number was kept to 30, and the products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gel. Previous studies have shown that the splicing of intron 3 of the human 9G8 gene was regulated by alternative splicing in embryonic tissues (Fig. 1 A and see Ref. 26Popielarz M. Cavaloc Y. Mattei M.G. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17830-17835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine whether regulation of intron 3 has been maintained during evolution, we first cloned and sequenced DNA around the exon 3/intron 3 and intron 3/exon 4 junctions in various vertebrates (Fig. 1 B). As previously noted for the human 9G8 gene, the 3′-end of intron 3 of all species analyzed is particularly unusual. A purine-rich sequence of at least 10 residues is located immediately upstream to the CAG 3′, which pushes the standard U-rich sequence 15 residues upstream of the intron 3/exon 4 junction. In contrast, the 5′-splice sites appear to be less altered, although they never contain more than 5 successive consensus residues and the important G residue at position +5 is absent (in human and mouse) or flanked by two nonconsensus residues at positions +4 and +6 (Fig.1 B). Thus, this sequence comparison indicates that the 3′- and 5′-splice sites are suboptimal, in four distant species, strongly suggesting that the alternative splicing of intron 3 might occur in many vertebrates. To test this hypothesis, we have performed Northern blot analyses with 9G8 mRNA or intron 3 probes on total RNA isolated from adult human and mouse tissues (Fig. 1, C and D). Previous analysis had only been performed on embryonic human tissues (26Popielarz M. Cavaloc Y. Mattei M.G. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17830-17835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C and as previously observed with embryonic tissues (26Popielarz M. Cavaloc Y. Mattei M.G. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17830-17835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), four mRNA isoforms, from the classic 1.4-kb mRNA to the largest 3.6-kb mRNA, are identified with a 9G8 cDNA probe that results from alternative splicing (excision/retention) of intron 3 and use of two polyadenylation sites (see Fig. 1 Afor their structure). Interestingly, the alternative splicing of 9G8 mRNA is also modulated in the adult tissues. Indeed, the retention of complete intron 3, as estimated by the accumulation of the 2.4-kb isoform relative to that of the 1.4-kb mRNA, is weak in liver, lung, heart, and skeletal muscle, whereas it is highest in kidney and in pancreas (compare the left and the right panels in Fig. 1 C). The same kind of splicing pattern is obtained from mouse tissues (Fig. 1 D), the 2.4-/2.6-kb species doublet being poorly separated. We still observe a splicing modulation of intron 3, because the weakest retention of intron 3 was detected in skeletal muscle, whereas the relative retention of intron 3 was highest in testis, kidney, and brain. RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from various mouse tissues also revealed that, relative to the minus intron 3 mRNA isoform, the intron 3-containing isoform is predominant in kidney and brain (data not shown). Thus, data in Fig. 1 clearly show that intron 3 alternative splicing is subjected to modulation according to the tissues,i.e. modulation that could be more dramatic if considering individual cell types within tissues. Because the 5′- and 3′-splice sites of intron 3 are suboptimal, we hypothesized that the splicing of intron 3 must require additional cis-acting sequences. To identify these elements, we used an in vitrosplicing assay. The standard E3-E4 pre-mRNA includes the major part of exon 3, the intron 3 whose size has been reduced from 875 to 469 nt to obtain more efficient splicing (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the whole exon 4 followed by 23 nt from the intron 4. The splicing of the E3-E4 pre-mRNA was analyzed in Fig.2 B (lane 2), in which only the lariat intron 3 is shown, or in Fig. 7 (lane 2) in which both final products and free exon 3 are shown. Despite the weakness of the 5′- and 3′-splice sites of intron 3, we observed that the splicing was relatively efficient, as judged by the accumulation of the lariat intron (Figs. 2 B and3 B are examples). This suggests that splicing of intron 3 may require some cisenhancers to compensate for the weakness of the wild-type splice sites. As shown in Fig. 2 A, purine-rich elements of 12 or 17 residues are present in each half of exon 4, labeled A andB. To determine whether exon 4 contains enhancer sequences that are required for the splicing of intron 3, each half of exon 4 was replaced in the pre-mRNA E3-E4 by exonic sequences of the constitutive exon 2, generating E3-E4 ΨA and ΨB pre-mRNA, respectively. Compared with the initial E3-E4 RNA, we observed that replacement of the A or B half by the ΨA or ΨB sequences (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 4, respectively) results in a significant impairment of splicing. In addition, concomitant replacement of both halves in the E3-E4 RNA by the ΨAB sequences leads to a dramatic splicing inhibition (lane 5). To determine whether the purine motifs in each half of exon 4 were involved in the activation process, these motifs were replaced by neutral sequences giving rise to the mPuA and mPuB constructs (see Fig.2 A). As shown above, the replacement of each purine-motif induced a decrease of the splicing reaction (Fig. 2 B,lanes 6 and 7). An almost complete splicing inhibition was observed after the replacement of both purine sequences (in the mPuAB transcript, lane 8). Thus, our results suggest that the purine sequences A and B of exon 4 are directly involved and cooperate in promoting the intron 3 splicing, most likely through an activation of the weak 3′-splice site. Immediately upstream the 5′-splice site of intron 3 (between positions −13 and −5, see Fig. 3 A), we noticed a (GAA)3motif. In other alternative splicing models such motifs have been demonstrated to activate weak 3′-splice sites upstream (36Tanaka K. Watakabe A. Shimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 37Xu R. Teng J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3660-3674Cr"
https://openalex.org/W1988303786,"Mutations in RVS161 andRVS167, the two yeast amphiphysin homologs, cause very similar growth phenotypes, a depolarized actin cytoskeleton, and a defect in the internalization step of endocytosis. Rvs161p and Rvs167p have been shown to interact in the two-hybrid system, but their localization in the cell may be different thus raising the question whether the interaction is physiologically relevant. Here we demonstrate that the two proteins function together in vivo. We find that the steady state level of Rvs167p is strongly reduced in an rvs161Δ strain. Similarly, the level of Rvs161p is strongly reduced in an rvs167Δ strain. We demonstrate that these reduced protein levels at steady state are due to a decreased stability of either Rvs protein in the absence of the other protein. Furthermore, we find that the amount and ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for receptor-mediated endocytosis. In addition, by using the two-hybrid system we show that the interaction of Rvs167p with actin is not abolished in anabp1Δ strain suggesting that Abp1p is not essential for this interaction.

We demonstrate that these reduced protein levels at steady state are due to a decreased stability of either Rvs protein in the absence of the other protein. Furthermore, we find that the amount and ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for receptor-mediated endocytosis. In addition, by using the two-hybrid system we show that the interaction of Rvs167p with actin is not abolished in anabp1Δ strain suggesting that Abp1p is not essential for this interaction. open reading frame polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild type 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside The yeast Rvs161p and Rvs167p, together with mammalian amphiphysin I and II, nematode, and fission yeast isoforms, constitute a family of conserved proteins (1Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The N termini of the different proteins share the highest homology, and this common domain was called the BAR domain (BIN/Amphiphysin/RVS domain (2Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)). Rvs161p consists only of the BAR domain (Fig. 1), whereas the other members of the family have an SH3 domain at their C termini and a central domain varying among the different proteins. In the case of Rvs167p, the central domain is rich in glycine, proline, and alanine and therefore is called the GPA domain (Fig. 1).The mammalian homolog, amphiphysin I, was first identified as a brain protein enriched at presynaptic regions (3Lichte B. Veh R.W. Meyer H.E. Kilimann M.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The identification of dynamin, synaptojanin, the αc-subunit of AP2-adaptin, and clathrin as amphiphysin I-interacting proteins further implicated amphiphysin I in endocytosis (1Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A more broadly expressed isoform, amphiphysin II, has been identified by several groups and was found to interact with the same proteins that interact with amphiphysin I (1Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the two isoforms can be coimmunoprecipitated from brain extracts suggesting that they act in concert (4Wigge P. Kohler K. Vallis Y. Doyle C.A. Owen D. Hunt S.P. McMahon H.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2003-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Indeed, two studies (4Wigge P. Kohler K. Vallis Y. Doyle C.A. Owen D. Hunt S.P. McMahon H.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2003-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 31Ramjaun A.R. Micheva K.D. Bouchelet I. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16700-16706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) found that the two amphiphysin isoforms colocalize in brain. However, a third study identified a different subcellular localization of the two isoforms (5Butler M.H. David C. Ochoa G.C. Freyberg Z. Daniell L. Grabs D. Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Amphiphysin I was shown to be concentrated in the cortical cytoplasm of nerve terminals, whereas amphiphysin II was concentrated in axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier (5Butler M.H. David C. Ochoa G.C. Freyberg Z. Daniell L. Grabs D. Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).The two yeast members of the amphiphysin family, encoded byRVS161 and RVS167, were first identified in a screen for mutations causing reduced viability upon nutrient starvation (6Crouzet M. Urdaci M. Dulau L. Aigle M. Yeast. 1991; 7: 727-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). RVS161 was also identified in a screen for endocytosis mutants (8Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Mutations in rvs161 orrvs167 exhibit the same phenotypes except for a defect in cell fusion only found in the rvs161 mutant (9Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mutant phenotypes include defects in endocytosis, cell polarization, bud site selection in diploid cells, and a depolarized actin cytoskeleton (7Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar,10Sivadon P. Bauer F. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Rvs161p and Rvs167p have been shown to interact through the BAR domain in the two-hybrid system (11Navarro P. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, their localization in the cell seems to be different, raising the question whether the Rvs161p-Rvs167p interaction is relevant in vivo. Rvs161p was shown to be mainly cytosolic in unbudded cells, and upon bud emergence it localizes mainly to the mother-bud neck region (9Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, in unbudded cells Rvs167p is localized mainly in small cortical patches throughout the cell which polarize at the bud emergence site and in small buds (12Balguerie A. Sivadon P. Bonneu M. Aigle M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using the two-hybrid system the BAR domain of Rvs167 has also been shown to mediate homodimerization in one study (13Colwill K. Field D. Moore L. Friesen J. Andrews B. Genetics. 1999; 152: 881-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and another study failed to detect any Rvs167p-Rvs167p interaction (11Navarro P. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Mutations in rvs161 and rvs167 affect the actin cytoskeleton (7Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Sivadon P. Bauer F. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SH3 domain of Rvs167p has been shown to interact with actin in the two-hybrid system (14Amberg D.C. Basart E. Botstein D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The finding that Rvs167p interacts with the actin-binding protein Abp1p through its GPA/SH3 domains (15Lila T. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) led to the hypothesis that Abp1p could mediate the interaction between Rvs167p and actin.In this study we investigated whether Rvs161p and Rvs167p indeed function together in vivo. We find that the steady state level of Rvs161p is strongly reduced in an rvs167Δ strain. Similarly, the level of Rvs167p is strongly reduced in anrvs161Δ strain. We demonstrate that these reduced protein levels at steady state are caused by a decreased stability of either Rvs protein in a strain mutated in the other rvs gene. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the amount and ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for receptor-mediated endocytosis. In addition, by using the two-hybrid system we find that Abp1p is not required to mediate the interaction of Rvs167p with actin.DISCUSSIONIn this study we provide direct evidence that Rvs161p and Rvs167p function together in vivo. We find that the steady state levels of the two proteins are interdependent. This effect is caused by a dramatically decreased stability of either Rvs protein in the absence of its partner. These data provide evidence that the interaction of Rvs161p and Rvs167p is physiologically relevant and required for the stability of both proteins. Furthermore, these findings might explain the almost identical phenotypes that are seen upon mutation of the two genes individually. The mutant phenotypes detected in either mutant strain might be a combination of loss of both Rvs proteins. Nevertheless, the function of Rvs161p in cell fusion (9Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) does not seem to require Rvs protein-protein interaction. Apparently, the highly reduced levels of Rvs161p in the rvs167Δ mutant are sufficient for this function. As seen in Fig. 3 B, Rvs161p is more sensitive to Rvs167p levels than vice versa. Since Rvs167p has two additional domains when compared with Rvs161p, this difference might reflect a partial stabilization of Rvs167p in the absence of Rvs161p via interactions mediated by these domains with other proteins (e.g. interaction with actin).As mentioned in the Introduction, two previous studies have investigated the cellular localization of Rvs161p (mostly cytoplasmic, at mother-bud neck region in small budded cells (9Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)) and Rvs167p (small cortical patches that polarize upon bud emergence (12Balguerie A. Sivadon P. Bonneu M. Aigle M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The two proteins apparently do not colocalize in the cell; however, in this study we have provided evidence that these two proteins do function together in vivo. This discrepancy might be explained if one considers that Rvs161p localization is mainly cytosolic. Therefore, it might also be localized to the Rvs167p-containing patches but is not concentrated there. In the case of Rvs167p, the bright fluorescence caused by its high concentration in cortical patches might make it difficult to detect an additional weak diffuse cytosolic staining. Therefore, it is possible that a certain amount of Rvs167p is localized to the cytosol and interacts with Rvs161p.Interestingly, overexpression of either Rvs161p or Rvs167p alone in a WT strain has no major effect on the internalization step of endocytosis. However, co-overexpression of both proteins reduced the α-factor internalization rate to two-thirds of WT levels. Also, overexpression of Rvs161p in an rvs167Δ strain, as well as overexpression of Rvs167p in an rvs161Δ strain, exacerbated the endocytic defect found in the mutated strains. Since the amount of protein upon overexpression is similar in all the strains (WT, rvs161Δ, and rvs167Δ, data not shown), we conclude that both the amount and the ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for the internalization step of endocytosis. We have tested the strains used for the endocytosis assays for an actin and a growth phenotype. None of the strains overexpressing the Rvs proteins exhibited an obvious change in their actin cytoskeleton when compared with the strains with the empty vectors. Also the growth rates were almost identical with the exception of a mild defect detected upon overexpression of Rvs167p in the rvs161Δ strain. The endocytic defect we detect in some of the strains overexpressing the Rvs proteins might be explained in two ways. One possibility would be that overexpression of the Rvs proteins causes a very subtle actin defect not detectable by immunofluorescence but affecting endocytosis. Another possibility would be that by overexpressing the Rvs proteins another protein required for endocytosis is titrated out and therefore endocytosis is affected.By using the two-hybrid system, we detected an interaction of Rvs167p with itself mediated via the BAR domain as previously described (13Colwill K. Field D. Moore L. Friesen J. Andrews B. Genetics. 1999; 152: 881-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the same domain also mediates the interaction with Rvs161p, we wanted to determine whether the Rvs167p-Rvs167p interaction is direct or mediated via Rvs161p. Two-hybrid analysis in an rvs161Δstrain demonstrated that Rvs161p is not required for this interaction and, therefore, Rvs167p either interacts directly with itself or the interaction is mediated via a protein other than Rvs161p. Interestingly, amphiphysin I has also been shown to interact with itself in mammalian cells (27Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).Mutations in rvs161 and rvs167 have been shown to affect the actin cytoskeleton (7Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Sivadon P. Bauer F. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A previous study has shown that Rvs167p interacts with actin via its SH3 domain (14Amberg D.C. Basart E. Botstein D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that the actin-binding protein Abp1p could mediate this Rvs167p-actin interaction (15Lila T. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Here we show that in the two-hybrid system Rvs167p interacts with actin in an abp1Δ strain showing that Abp1p is not required for this interaction. There are several possible explanations for this finding. First, it could be that in the absence of Abp1p another protein takes over its function. Second, there could be more than one protein involved in mediating this interaction. Third, Rvs167p could interact directly with actin. Another potential candidate to mediate the Rvs167p-actin interaction could be Las17p, since it was shown to interact with the GPA/SH3-domains of Rvs167p in the two-hybrid system (32Madania A. Dumoulin P. Grava S. Kitamoto H. Schärer-Brodbec C. Soulard A. Moreau V. Winsor B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3521-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).rvs mutant cells show pleiotropic phenotypes including sensitivity to nonoptimal growth conditions, defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, defects in bud-site selection, and endocytosis (7Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 10Sivadon P. Bauer F. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rvs167p was identified as a target of the Pho85 cyclin-dependent kinase and thus might be involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton early in cell cycle (28Lee J. Colwill K. Aneliunas V. Tennyson C. Moore L. Ho Y. Andrews B. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1310-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also its mammalian homolog, amphiphysin, has been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation (27Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 29Bauerfeind R. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30984-30992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, amphiphysin I has been implicated in the autoimmune Stiff-Man syndrome disorder associated with breast cancer, and amphiphysin II has been shown to interact with the MYC oncoprotein implicating it in cell cycle control (2Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 30David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that some general functions and regulation of these proteins have been conserved through evolution. In addition, these findings implicate the members of this protein family not only as important players in intracellular membrane trafficking but also in mediating signals during the cell cycle.In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that the yeast amphiphysin homologs Rvs161p and Rvs167p function together in vivo. The interaction between the proteins seems to be crucial for their stability. Furthermore, we show that the amount and ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for the internalization step of endocytosis. The yeast Rvs161p and Rvs167p, together with mammalian amphiphysin I and II, nematode, and fission yeast isoforms, constitute a family of conserved proteins (1Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The N termini of the different proteins share the highest homology, and this common domain was called the BAR domain (BIN/Amphiphysin/RVS domain (2Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)). Rvs161p consists only of the BAR domain (Fig. 1), whereas the other members of the family have an SH3 domain at their C termini and a central domain varying among the different proteins. In the case of Rvs167p, the central domain is rich in glycine, proline, and alanine and therefore is called the GPA domain (Fig. 1). The mammalian homolog, amphiphysin I, was first identified as a brain protein enriched at presynaptic regions (3Lichte B. Veh R.W. Meyer H.E. Kilimann M.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The identification of dynamin, synaptojanin, the αc-subunit of AP2-adaptin, and clathrin as amphiphysin I-interacting proteins further implicated amphiphysin I in endocytosis (1Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A more broadly expressed isoform, amphiphysin II, has been identified by several groups and was found to interact with the same proteins that interact with amphiphysin I (1Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the two isoforms can be coimmunoprecipitated from brain extracts suggesting that they act in concert (4Wigge P. Kohler K. Vallis Y. Doyle C.A. Owen D. Hunt S.P. McMahon H.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2003-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Indeed, two studies (4Wigge P. Kohler K. Vallis Y. Doyle C.A. Owen D. Hunt S.P. McMahon H.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2003-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 31Ramjaun A.R. Micheva K.D. Bouchelet I. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16700-16706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) found that the two amphiphysin isoforms colocalize in brain. However, a third study identified a different subcellular localization of the two isoforms (5Butler M.H. David C. Ochoa G.C. Freyberg Z. Daniell L. Grabs D. Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Amphiphysin I was shown to be concentrated in the cortical cytoplasm of nerve terminals, whereas amphiphysin II was concentrated in axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier (5Butler M.H. David C. Ochoa G.C. Freyberg Z. Daniell L. Grabs D. Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The two yeast members of the amphiphysin family, encoded byRVS161 and RVS167, were first identified in a screen for mutations causing reduced viability upon nutrient starvation (6Crouzet M. Urdaci M. Dulau L. Aigle M. Yeast. 1991; 7: 727-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). RVS161 was also identified in a screen for endocytosis mutants (8Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Mutations in rvs161 orrvs167 exhibit the same phenotypes except for a defect in cell fusion only found in the rvs161 mutant (9Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mutant phenotypes include defects in endocytosis, cell polarization, bud site selection in diploid cells, and a depolarized actin cytoskeleton (7Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar,10Sivadon P. Bauer F. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Rvs161p and Rvs167p have been shown to interact through the BAR domain in the two-hybrid system (11Navarro P. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, their localization in the cell seems to be different, raising the question whether the Rvs161p-Rvs167p interaction is relevant in vivo. Rvs161p was shown to be mainly cytosolic in unbudded cells, and upon bud emergence it localizes mainly to the mother-bud neck region (9Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, in unbudded cells Rvs167p is localized mainly in small cortical patches throughout the cell which polarize at the bud emergence site and in small buds (12Balguerie A. Sivadon P. Bonneu M. Aigle M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using the two-hybrid system the BAR domain of Rvs167 has also been shown to mediate homodimerization in one study (13Colwill K. Field D. Moore L. Friesen J. Andrews B. Genetics. 1999; 152: 881-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and another study failed to detect any Rvs167p-Rvs167p interaction (11Navarro P. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutations in rvs161 and rvs167 affect the actin cytoskeleton (7Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Sivadon P. Bauer F. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SH3 domain of Rvs167p has been shown to interact with actin in the two-hybrid system (14Amberg D.C. Basart E. Botstein D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The finding that Rvs167p interacts with the actin-binding protein Abp1p through its GPA/SH3 domains (15Lila T. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) led to the hypothesis that Abp1p could mediate the interaction between Rvs167p and actin. In this study we investigated whether Rvs161p and Rvs167p indeed function together in vivo. We find that the steady state level of Rvs161p is strongly reduced in an rvs167Δ strain. Similarly, the level of Rvs167p is strongly reduced in anrvs161Δ strain. We demonstrate that these reduced protein levels at steady state are caused by a decreased stability of either Rvs protein in a strain mutated in the other rvs gene. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the amount and ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for receptor-mediated endocytosis. In addition, by using the two-hybrid system we find that Abp1p is not required to mediate the interaction of Rvs167p with actin. DISCUSSIONIn this study we provide direct evidence that Rvs161p and Rvs167p function together in vivo. We find that the steady state levels of the two proteins are interdependent. This effect is caused by a dramatically decreased stability of either Rvs protein in the absence of its partner. These data provide evidence that the interaction of Rvs161p and Rvs167p is physiologically relevant and required for the stability of both proteins. Furthermore, these findings might explain the almost identical phenotypes that are seen upon mutation of the two genes individually. The mutant phenotypes detected in either mutant strain might be a combination of loss of both Rvs proteins. Nevertheless, the function of Rvs161p in cell fusion (9Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) does not seem to require Rvs protein-protein interaction. Apparently, the highly reduced levels of Rvs161p in the rvs167Δ mutant are sufficient for this function. As seen in Fig. 3 B, Rvs161p is more sensitive to Rvs167p levels than vice versa. Since Rvs167p has two additional domains when compared with Rvs161p, this difference might reflect a partial stabilization of Rvs167p in the absence of Rvs161p via interactions mediated by these domains with other proteins (e.g. interaction with actin).As mentioned in the Introduction, two previous studies have investigated the cellular localization of Rvs161p (mostly cytoplasmic, at mother-bud neck region in small budded cells (9Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)) and Rvs167p (small cortical patches that polarize upon bud emergence (12Balguerie A. Sivadon P. Bonneu M. Aigle M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The two proteins apparently do not colocalize in the cell; however, in this study we have provided evidence that these two proteins do function together in vivo. This discrepancy might be explained if one considers that Rvs161p localization is mainly cytosolic. Therefore, it might also be localized to the Rvs167p-containing patches but is not concentrated there. In the case of Rvs167p, the bright fluorescence caused by its high concentration in cortical patches might make it difficult to detect an additional weak diffuse cytosolic staining. Therefore, it is possible that a certain amount of Rvs167p is localized to the cytosol and interacts with Rvs161p.Interestingly, overexpression of either Rvs161p or Rvs167p alone in a WT strain has no major effect on the internalization step of endocytosis. However, co-overexpression of both proteins reduced the α-factor internalization rate to two-thirds of WT levels. Also, overexpression of Rvs161p in an rvs167Δ strain, as well as overexpression of Rvs167p in an rvs161Δ strain, exacerbated the endocytic defect found in the mutated strains. Since the amount of protein upon overexpression is similar in all the strains (WT, rvs161Δ, and rvs167Δ, data not shown), we conclude that both the amount and the ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for the internalization step of endocytosis. We have tested the strains used for the endocytosis assays for an actin and a growth phenotype. None of the strains overexpressing the Rvs proteins exhibited an obvious change in their actin cytoskeleton when compared with the strains with the empty vectors. Also the growth rates were almost identical with the exception of a mild defect detected upon overexpression of Rvs167p in the rvs161Δ strain. The endocytic defect we detect in some of the strains overexpressing the Rvs proteins might be explained in two ways. One possibility would be that overexpression of the Rvs proteins causes a very subtle actin defect not detectable by immunofluorescence but affecting endocytosis. Another possibility would be that by overexpressing the Rvs proteins another protein required for endocytosis is titrated out and therefore endocytosis is affected.By using the two-hybrid system, we detected an interaction of Rvs167p with itself mediated via the BAR domain as previously described (13Colwill K. Field D. Moore L. Friesen J. Andrews B. Genetics. 1999; 152: 881-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the same domain also mediates the interaction with Rvs161p, we wanted to determine whether the Rvs167p-Rvs167p interaction is direct or mediated via Rvs161p. Two-hybrid analysis in an rvs161Δstrain demonstrated that Rvs161p is not required for this interaction and, therefore, Rvs167p either interacts directly with itself or the interaction is mediated via a protein other than Rvs161p. Interestingly, amphiphysin I has also been shown to interact with itself in mammalian cells (27Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).Mutations in rvs161 and rvs167 have been shown to affect the actin cytoskeleton (7Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Sivadon P. Bauer F. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A previous study has shown that Rvs167p interacts with actin via its SH3 domain (14Amberg D.C. Basart E. Botstein D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that the actin-binding protein Abp1p could mediate this Rvs167p-actin interaction (15Lila T. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Here we show that in the two-hybrid system Rvs167p interacts with actin in an abp1Δ strain showing that Abp1p is not required for this interaction. There are several possible explanations for this finding. First, it could be that in the absence of Abp1p another protein takes over its function. Second, there could be more than one protein involved in mediating this interaction. Third, Rvs167p could interact directly with actin. Another potential candidate to mediate the Rvs167p-actin interaction could be Las17p, since it was shown to interact with the GPA/SH3-domains of Rvs167p in the two-hybrid system (32Madania A. Dumoulin P. Grava S. Kitamoto H. Schärer-Brodbec C. Soulard A. Moreau V. Winsor B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3521-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).rvs mutant cells show pleiotropic phenotypes including sensitivity to nonoptimal growth conditions, defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, defects in bud-site selection, and endocytosis (7Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol.

Interestingly, Rvs167p was identified as a target of the Pho85 cyclin-dependent kinase and thus might be involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton early in cell cycle (28Lee J. Colwill K. Aneliunas V. Tennyson C. Moore L. Ho Y. Andrews B. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1310-1321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also its mammalian homolog, amphiphysin, has been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation (27Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 29Bauerfeind R. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30984-30992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, amphiphysin I has been implicated in the autoimmune Stiff-Man syndrome disorder associated with breast cancer, and amphiphysin II has been shown to interact with the MYC oncoprotein implicating it in cell cycle control (2Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 30David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that some general functions and regulation of these proteins have been conserved through evolution. In addition, these findings implicate the members of this protein family not only as important players in intracellular membrane trafficking but also in mediating signals during the cell cycle.In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that the yeast amphiphysin homologs Rvs161p and Rvs167p function together in vivo. The interaction between the proteins seems to be crucial for their stability. Furthermore, we show that the amount and ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for the internalization step of endocytosis. In this study we provide direct evidence that Rvs161p and Rvs167p function together in vivo. We find that the steady state levels of the two proteins are interdependent. This effect is caused by a dramatically decreased stability of either Rvs protein in the absence of its partner. These data provide evidence that the interaction of Rvs161p and Rvs167p is physiologically relevant and required for the stability of both proteins. Furthermore, these findings might explain the almost identical phenotypes that are seen upon mutation of the two genes individually. The mutant phenotypes detected in either mutant strain might be a combination of loss of both Rvs proteins. Nevertheless, the function of Rvs161p in cell fusion (9Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) does not seem to require Rvs protein-protein interaction. Apparently, the highly reduced levels of Rvs161p in the rvs167Δ mutant are sufficient for this function. As seen in Fig. 3 B, Rvs161p is more sensitive to Rvs167p levels than vice versa. Since Rvs167p has two additional domains when compared with Rvs161p, this difference might reflect a partial stabilization of Rvs167p in the absence of Rvs161p via interactions mediated by these domains with other proteins (e.g. interaction with actin).

Disruption of Rad50 in mice leads to lethality during early embryogenesis, indicating its essential function in normal proliferating cells. In addition to its ability to form a complex with the DNA double-strand break repair proteins Mre11 and NBS1, Rad50 may interact with other cellular proteins to execute its full range of biological activities. A novel 87-kDa protein named RINT-1 was identified using the C-terminal region of human Rad50 as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Human RINT-1 shares sequence homology with a novel protein identified inDrosophila melanogaster, including a coiled-coil domain within its N-terminal 150 amino acids, a conserved central domain of about 350 amino acids, and a C-terminal region of 90 amino acids exhibiting 35–38% identity. The conserved central and C-terminal regions of RINT-1 are required for its interaction with Rad50. While Rad50 and RINT-1 are both expressed throughout the cell cycle, RINT-1 specifically binds to Rad50 only during late S and G2/M phases, suggesting that RINT-1 may be involved in cell cycle regulation. Consistent with this possibility, MCF-7 cells expressing an N-terminally truncated RINT-1 protein displayed a defective radiation-induced G2/M checkpoint. These results suggest that RINT-1 may play a role in the regulation of cell cycle control after DNA damage.

NTP, nucleoside triphosphate The RAD50 gene was first identified inSaccharomyces cerevisiae based on its role in DNA repair (1Game J.C. Mortimer R.K. Mutat. Res. 1974; 24: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). It is a member of the RAD52 epistasis group, members of which function in recombinational DNA repair. Yeast strains carryingrad50 mutations exhibit hypersensitivity to γ-irradiation and radiomimetic chemicals such as methyl methanesulfonate and only slight sensitivity to UV irradiation (1Game J.C. Mortimer R.K. Mutat. Res. 1974; 24: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition, rad50 mutations also lead to telomere shortening and meiotic failure (1Game J.C. Mortimer R.K. Mutat. Res. 1974; 24: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The 153-kDa Rad50 protein contains both an N-terminal Walker A and an C-terminal Walker B NTP binding domains, linked by two extensive coiled-coil regions that are characterized by leucine heptad repeats (2Alani E. Subbiah S. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1989; 122: 47-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence architecture is similar to that found in other members of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC)1 protein family (3Saitoh N. Goldberg I. Earnshaw W.C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 4Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The first 35 heptad repeats span amino acids 177–421 of the Rad50 sequence, whereas the second 37 heptad repeats span amino acids 743–995. These heptad repeat sequences exhibit length and significant sequence similarity to the S2 domain of rabbit myosin (2Alani E. Subbiah S. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1989; 122: 47-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations within the Rad50 Walker A domain that alter conserved amino acids resides within the NTP binding site confer a null phenotype, and several mutations near the nucleotide binding sites cause defects in meiosis (5Alani E. Padmore R. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 419-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The RAD50 gene product is highly conserved among species. Human and yeast Rad50 share more than 50% sequence identity within their corresponding N- and C-terminal regions as well as a similar coiled-coil structure in between. A null mutation of the mouseRad50 gene is associated with an embryonic lethal phenotype, and cells derived from early embryos are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation, suggesting that Rad50 is essential for normal cell proliferation and DNA double-strand break repair (6Luo G. Yao M.S. Bender C.F. Mills M. Bladl A.R. Bradley A. Petrini J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7376-7381Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Yeast Rad50 forms a complex with Mre11 and Xrs2 (7Johzuka K. Ogawa H. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, human Rad50 forms a complex with hMre11 and NBS1, the potentially functional homologue of yeast Xrs2 (8Dolganov G.M. Maser R.S. Novikov A. Tosto L. Chong S. Bressan D.A. Petrini J.H. Mol.

Mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in Mre11 are not viable (16Xiao Y. Weaver D.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2985-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suggesting that Mre11, like Rad50, is essential for normal proliferating cells and DNA double-strand break repair. Thus, while it is clear that these three proteins function as a triplex in DNA double-strand break repair, it is also very likely that these proteins function in association with other partners to have different biological functions. To explore other potential functions of Rad50, we have identified a novel Rad50-interacting protein, named RINT-1. These two proteins specifically interact during S and M phases of the cell cycle. Expression in human breast cancer MCF7 cells of an N-terminally truncated RINT-1 protein that is capable of binding to Rad50 leads to failure of G2/M, but not G1/S, checkpoint control. These results suggest that RINT-1 may play a role in cell cycle checkpoint control.

To obtain cells in M phase, nocodazole (0.4 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium for 8 h prior to harvest as described (17Chen P.L. Scully P. Shew J.Y. Wang J.Y. Lee W.H.

A pAS-R50PB plasmid was constructed by inserting a portion of the human Rad50 cDNA encoding the region containing second leucine heptad repeats and Walker B NTP binding domain (amino acids 753–1312) into the expression vector pAS1, which contains the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (18Keegan L. Gill G. Ptashne M. Science. 1986; 231: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar,19Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). pAS-R50PB was used as the bait in a screen of a human B lymphocytes cDNA library as described previously (20Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The cDNA clones identified in the screen were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar). For binding assays, three Rad50 deletion constructs were fused with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in frame, creating pAS-R50PB (amino acids 753–1312), pAS-R50PB0.6 (amino acids 753–953), and pAS-R50PB1.2 (amino acids 953–1312). Various RINT-1 deletion mutants (RINT-H, amino acids 1–227; RINT-RV, amino acids 1–466; RINT-P, amino acids 1–706; RINT-PCR3, amino acids 415–792; and RINT-SX, amino acids 257–792) were fused with GAL4 transactivation domain on the pSE1107 vector. The plasmids containing the bait and the prey were cotransformed into Y153 yeast strain, assayed for β-galactosidase activities by the colony lift method, and quantified with the chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside assay as described (20Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Plasmids for the bacterial expression of several glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were constructed following standard protocols (22Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). GST-PIN and GST-PIC contain translational fusions of GST with amino acids 1–256 and 501–792 of RINT-1, respectively. For Rad50, GST-PB (amino acids 753–1312 of Rad50), GST-PB0.6 (amino acids 753–953), and GST-PB1.2 (amino acids 953–1312) were constructed. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm in an exponentially growing culture of bacteria at 30 °C for 3 h. Bacteria were collected and lysed as described. Fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-coupled agarose beads (23Shan B. Zhu X. Chen P.-L. Durfee T. Yang Y. Sharp D. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5620-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). For in vitrotranscription and translation of RINT-1 protein, the cDNA that begins with the first ATG start codon (Fig. 1) was subcloned into pBSK and transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Glutathione-Sepharose beads containing about 5 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins were initially preincubated with Tris-buffered saline-bovine serum albumin buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 10% bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml of protease inhibitors including leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, and pepstatin) for 10 min at room temperature. The beads were then incubated with an equal amount of in vitro translated products in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the protease inhibitors listed above) for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. Complexes were washed extensively with the lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by fluorography. To identify the cellular RINT-1 protein, about 1 × 107 Molt-4 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 3 h and lysed in ice-cold Lysis250 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain) (24Chen Y. Chen C.F. Riley D.J. Allred D.C. Chen P.L. Von Hoff D. Osborne C.K. Lee W.H. Science. 1995; 270: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of clarified lysates (14,000 × g for 5 min) were incubated with anti-PIN or anti-PIC antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h, protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for another 1 h with constant rotation. Finally, the beads were collected and washed with Lysis250 buffer five times, and the immunoprecipitates were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by fluorography. For double immunoprecipitations, the immunoprecipitates were boiled in 200 μl of dissociation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), diluted with 1 ml of Lysis250 buffer, and immunoprecipitated once again with the same antibodies as previously described (24Chen Y. Chen C.F. Riley D.J. Allred D.C. Chen P.L. Von Hoff D. Osborne C.K. Lee W.H. Science. 1995; 270: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation, synchronized T24 cells were lysed and clarified as described above, and the supernatant was diluted with lysis buffer without salt (the final concentration of NaCl was 180 mm) before adding the anti-Rad50 mAb 13B3 (25Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) or anti-RINT-1 antisera. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The immunoblots were then probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate toluidinium and nitro blue tetrazolium (Promega, Madison, WI). In some experiments, p84, a nuclear matrix protein (26Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), served as an internal control. To establish cell clones that conditionally express the mutated RINT-1 (named RINT-XS, from amino acid 257 to 792), a UHD10–3-base plasmid, pUHD10–3/GFP-RINT-XS, that will express chimeric proteins containing GFP with a nuclear localization signal and a Myc epitope (27Chen C.F. Chen P.L. Zhong Q. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32931-32935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) fused to the RINT-XS controlled by a Tet-responsive promoter, was constructed. This plasmid was cotransfected into MCF-7 cells with a second plasmid, pCHTV, which contains a hygromycin resistance gene and a cytomegalovirus-controlled tetracycline repressor-VP16 fusion transcription unit (27Chen C.F. Chen P.L. Zhong Q. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32931-32935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For constitutive expression of the RINT-XS protein, a CHPL-GFP-base plasmid (28Li S. Ku C.Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.S. Chen C.F. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), with identical structure of pUHD10–3/GFP-RINT-XS, except controlled by CMV promoter and with the hygromycin resistance gene as selection marker, was used. Cell clones resistant to hygromycin (100 μg/ml) were subsequently isolated and examined for either constitutive or tetracycline-regulated expression of the GFP-RINT-XS proteins. Expression of these fusion proteins in these clones was examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc mAb 9E10 and blotted with an anti-GFP mAb (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Two constitutively expressing clones, clones 1 and 12, and one conditionally expressing clone, 122, were established and characterized. Cell cycle checkpoints were determined according to the procedures described (27Chen C.F. Chen P.L. Zhong Q. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32931-32935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 29Kuerbitz S.J. Plunkett B.S. Walsh W.V. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7491-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). For the G1/S checkpoint assay, cells in logarithmic growth were seeded on coverslips for 24 h in the presence or absence of tetracycline and mock-exposed or treated with 12 grays of γ-irradiation. After 24 h, cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd for 4 h and fixed for BrdUrd staining using a cell proliferation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). More than 1000 cells were counted for each clone under different conditions, and BrdUrd-positive cells were quantified and expressed as a fraction of the total cells. For the G2/M checkpoint, cells were seeded on the six-well dish with a density of 105 cells/well in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 24 h. Cells were then irradiated with 4 Gy and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at indicated time points. Alternatively, cells were fixed 2 h after treatment with various doses of irradiation. During the fixation process, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. About 200–400 cells in a field under a fluorescence microscope were imaged, and the mitotic phase including prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase was counted. More than 6000 cells under different microscopic fields were counted for each time point and expressed as a percentage of mitotic indices compared with the cells without treatment. To identify proteins that potentially interact with human Rad50, a fragment of Rad50 containing the second of two leucine heptad repeats and the Walker B NTP binding domain was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human B-cell library. The six strongest positive clones identified in this screen were sequenced and found to be identical. Subsequent data base searches revealed that the insert cDNA encodes a novel protein that we named hsRINT-1, which stands for Rad50 interacting protein 1. The complete sequence of the longest cDNA encompasses 2,855 nucleotides and contains a putative translation initiation codon, the first methionine, at position 111 with an open reading frame of 792 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). With the exception of several leucine heptad repeats in the N terminus of the predicted open reading frame, no other known functional domains have been identified in the predicted 87-kDa protein. However, significant sequence homology was found between RINT-1 and the CG8605 gene product in Drosophila melanogaster (30Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li P.W. Hoskins R.A. Galle R.F. George R.A. Lewis S.E. Richards S. Ashburner M. Henderson S.N. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar), which we refer to as dmRINT-1 (Fig. 1 B). The predicted sequences of both of these proteins share similar leucine heptad repeats within their corresponding N-terminal region (box A). Two additional regions designated box B, which spans amino acids 220–565 of hsRINT-1, and box D, which spans amino acids 659–751 of hsRINT-1, exhibit 35–39% homology to the corresponding regions of dmRINT-1. hsRINT-1 has a unique sequence, box C, that lies between the two conserved regions. The biological function of the dmRINT-1 is unknown at the present time. A search of the NCBI human genome data base revealed that hsRINT-1 maps to chromosome segment 7q22.1, between marker D7S2545 and D7S2420. Interestingly, deletion of this region is frequently associated with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, breast and ovarian adenocarcinoma, and additional cancer (31Mitelman F. Mitelman F. Catalog of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer. Wiley-Liss, Inc., NY1991: 475-573Google Scholar). To test whether RINT-1 specifically binds to Rad50, we sought to identify the binding region(s) of Rad50 responsible for interaction with RINT-1. In addition to the original bait plasmid, pAS-R50PB, two additional plasmids, pAS-R50PB0.6 and pAS-R50PB1.2, that express the second leucine haptad repeat and the Walker B domain of Rad50, respectively, were constructed as yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusions (Fig. 2 A). These plasmids were individually cotransformed into S. cerevisiaeY153 with a prey plasmid pSE-RINT-1 that expresses full-length RINT-1. Colorigenic and β-galactosidase activity assays indicated that the second leucine heptad repeat, but not the Walker B domain, of Rad50 interacts with RINT-1 (Fig. 2 A). In vitro binding assays using GST fusions of the same regions of Rad50 gave similar results (Fig. 2 C). To identify the domain of RINT-1 that interacts with Rad50, a numbers of RINT-1 deletion mutants were engineered as fusions with the GAL4 activation domain, and each mutant was tested for its ability to interact with Rad50, expressed from pAS-Rad50PB, following cotransformation in yeast. Resultant β-galactosidase assays revealed that the B, C, and D region of the RINT-1 protein, corresponding to amino acids 257–792, is required for its interaction with Rad50 (Fig. 2 B). Further deletions of either RINT-1 B or D region diminished interaction with Rad50 (Fig.2 B). To identify cellular proteins encoded by the novelRINT-1 gene, polyclonal antibodies were raised against two RINT-1 protein fragments expressed as GST fusions, GST-PIN (amino acids 1–256) and GST-PIC (amino acids 501–792). Metabolically labeled cellular proteins derived from human acute lymphoblastic leukemia Molt-4 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-PIN or anti-PIC immune sera or preimmune sera. A protein doublet exhibiting an electophoretic mobility consistent with the predicted 792-amino acid RINT-1 protein was specifically immunoprecipitated with both anti-PIN and anti-PIC antibodies (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 8), but not with preimmune antisera. However, preincubation of these two specific antibodies with GST-PIN (lane 5) or GST-PIC (lane 10) antigen, but not GST (lanes 4 and 9), completely abolished the immunoprecipitation of the protein doublet. In addition to the 87-kDa doublet, other cellular proteins were also observed in the immunoprecipitates. Using the rigorous protocol of reimmunoprecipitation, each of the anti-RINT-1 antibodies detected only the 87-kDa protein doublet (lanes 6 and 11). The RINT-1 protein synthesized by coupled in vitrotranscription and translation using a cDNA template that specifies translation initiation from the first methionine in the RINT-1 sequence exhibits a mobility upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis similar to that of the faster migrating cellular RINT-1 protein (Fig.3 A, compare lane 1 withlane 3). To determine whether the slower migrating form of RINT-1 is the product of post-translational modification, immunoprecipitated RINT-1 protein was treated with alkaline phosphatase. No mobility change was observed following phosphatase treatment, suggesting that the slower migrating form may arise from other cellular processes (data not shown). Alternatively, differential initiation of translation using a non-AUG codon could explain the appearance of the slower migrating form of RINT-1 protein. A longer RINT-1 cDNA including sequence upstream of the first ATG codon was in vitro transcribed and translated (Fig.1 A, the amino acid sequence). While the majority of the product thus synthesized in vitro exhibited an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to the faster migrating form, a distinct product exhibiting a mobility corresponding to the slower migrating form of the cellular RINT-1 protein was also detected (Fig.3 B, compare lane 2 withlane 3). These results suggest that the slower migrating form of the RINT-1 doublet corresponds to a polypeptide whose translation begins at an upstream non-AUG codon. Analysis of the 5′ RINT-1 cDNA sequence for non-AUG start codons (32Boeck R. Kolakofsky D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3608-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of two potential CUG start sites (see the twocircled leucines in Fig. 1). Both of these potential codons are flanked by purines at the −3- and +4-positions, indicating that either or both may be used for initiation of translation. We next examined the expression profile of the RINT-1 protein doublet in a panel of human cell lines. These include a breast epithelial immortalized line MCF10A; three human breast cancer lines, T47D, MB231, and ZR75; two human bladder carcinoma lines, T24 and 5637; a rectal carcinoma line, SW837; and two immortalized fibroblast lines, GM09607A and GM09637G, carrying mutated and wild-type ATM gene, respectively. RINT-1 doublet was detected in all cell lines (Fig.3 C), indicating that RINT-1 is expressed in many different kinds of human cells. To further explore the interaction of RINT-1 and Rad50 in cells, human bladder carcinoma T24 cells synchronized by density arrest and subsequent release were harvested at different time points. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RINT-1 or anti-Rad50 antibody, followed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for RINT-1 and Rad50. The specific cell cycle stage(s) from which the lysates were prepared at each time point was determined by probing immunoblots with anti-RB mAb as previously described (17Chen P.L. Scully P. Shew J.Y. Wang J.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 1193-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The amount of total lysate used for each time point was normalized by immunoblotting with an antibody specific for a nuclear matrix protein, p84 (26Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C, bottom panel). While the 87-kDa doublet was detected in immunoprecipitates using anti-RINT-1 antibody during all stages of the cell cycle, an interaction with Rad50 was observed only during late S, G2/M, and M phases (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6 in the top panel). Reciprocally, an interaction was also detected only after late S phase by immunoprecipitation with anti-Rad50 mAb. Interestingly, both bands of the RINT-1 doublet were coimmunoprecipitated with Rad50, although the slower migrating form of RINT-1 may preferentially bind to Rad50. Nevertheless, the specific interaction between RINT-1 and Rad50 at late S and G2/M suggests that RINT-1 may play a role at these time windows during cell cycle progression. To test the possibility that RINT-1 functions in DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint control, we established several stable breast cancer MCF7 clonal cell lines that express GFP fusions containing only the Rad50 binding region of RINT-1 (named GFP-RINT-XS). Among these, clone 1 constitutively expressed the GFP-RINT-XS fusion protein, while expression of the fusion protein in clone 122 was conditionally regulated by the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 5). The GFP-RINT-XS protein could be coimmunoprecipitated along with Rad50 (Fig. 5). It is possible that this N-terminally truncated protein may disturb the biological function(s) of the wild-type RINT-1 by binding to Rad50. Hence, we reasoned that this dominant negative mutant of RINT-1 might reveal the potential function of RINT-1 in cell cycle progression. To test this possibility, the clonal cell lines expressing the GFP-RINT-XS fusion, as well as a control clonal cell line (5UGN) expressing GFP alone, were examined for the integrity of their respective radiation-induced G1/S and G2/M checkpoints. Clone 122, the control clone 5UGN, and the parental MCF 7 cells all exhibited reduced BrdUrd-positive cells after treatment with 12 grays of γ-irradiation, independent of the GFP fusion protein expression (Fig.6 A). These results indicate that expression of the truncated RINT-1 protein did not interfere with the radiation-induced G1/S checkpoint. To examine whether these cells exhibit differences in G2/M checkpoint control, the mitotic index of each cell culture at various time points after γ-irradiation was scored (Fig. 6 B). In cells expressing GFP alone (5UGN, −Tet), a sharp reduction in mitotic index was observed, which was similar to that observed in cells without induced expression of GFP alone or GFP-RINT-XS (5UGN or clone 122, +Tet). In contrast, cells expressing the GFP-RINT-XS fusion protein (clone 122, −Tet) showed a comparatively delayed and significantly increased mitotic index (Fig. 6 B). In a parallel experiment, mitotic cells were scored 2 h following treatment with various doses of γ-irradiation (Fig. 6 C). Clone 122 cells induced to express GFP-RINT-XS exhibited a higher percentage of mitotic cells than cells without induced expression of the fusion protein or GFP alone. Similar results were also obtained using cells constitutively expressing GFP-RINT-XS (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that expression of an N-terminally truncated RINT-1 protein retaining its Rad50 binding region leads to an immediate delay of G2/M checkpoint following DNA damage. It is thus very likely that the RINT-1 and Rad50 complex may play an important role in control of the G2/M checkpoint in response to DNA damage.Figure 6Cells expressing RINT-XS show defective G2/M but intact G1/S checkpoints. A, G1/S checkpoint in γ-irradiated cells. The noninduced and induced MCF7 cell clones including 5UGN (GFP alone) and RINT-XS 122 (GFP fusion protein) were mock-exposed (0 Gy) or treated with γ-irradiation (12 Gy). Cells were labeled 24 h later with BrdUrd for 4 h and immunostained with anti-BrdUrd antibodies. The percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells was quantified and presented as a fraction of the total number of cells. In the γ-irradiated cells expressing GFP or GFP-RINT-XS (−Tet), the relative percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells decreased as much as the cells without expression of those proteins (+Tet), indicating an intact G1/S checkpoint. B and C, G2/M checkpoint in γ-irradiated cells. B, mitotic indices of cells treated with 4 grays at time points of 1, 2, and 4 h. Over 6000 cells were counted for each time point. Mock-exposed cells were used as controls. Significant reduction of the mitotic indices was observed in 5UGN or RINT-XS 122 cells with tetracycline (+Tet), reflecting an intact G2/M checkpoint, while RINT-XS 122 cells expressing the GFP-RINT-XS (−Tet) show marginal reductions of the mitotic indices, suggesting a defective G2/M checkpoint. C, as described in B, except cells treated with irradiation of 2, 4, or 8 grays and counted after 2 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to their function in DNA double-strand break repair, recent data have suggested that Rad50, together with Mre11 and NBS1, may also play a role in cell cycle checkpoint control (reviewed in Ref. 33Petrini J.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1264-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In yeast, an unrepairable double- strand break in ku70 mutant cells causes a permanent G2/M cell cycle arrest, while mutations in MRE11 suppress the inability of the cells to overcome double strand break-induced cell cycle arrest (34Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In NBS cells, a defect in the S phase checkpoint leading to radioresistant DNA synthesis and failure to activate checkpoints at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries in response to ionizing radiation has been observed (reviewed in Ref. 35Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 635-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NBS cells exposed to ionizing radiation exhibit a prolonged accumulation of cells in G2 phase (36Jongmans W. Vuillaume M. Chrzanowska K. Smeets D. Sperling K. Hall J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5016-5022Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BRCA1, a tumor suppressor linked to familial breast and ovarian cancer (37Hall J.M. Lee M.K. Newman B. Morrow J.E. Anderson L.A. Huey B. King M.C. Science. 1990; 250: 1684-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar), was found to associate with Rad50 (25Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 38Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition to its participation in transcriptional regulation, cell growth and differentiation, and DNA repair processes, BRCA1 has also been implicated in cell cycle checkpoint control, since deletions of exon 11 of BRCA1 display a defective G2/M checkpoint after ionizing radiation and methyl methanesulfonate treatments (39Xu X. Weaver Z. Linke S.P. Li C. Gotay J. Wang X.W. Harris C.C. Ried T. Deng C.X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence to show Rad50 in G2/M checkpoint control remains lacking. It is possible that RINT-1 functions independently or, alternatively, in association with a Rad50-BRCA1 complex to ensure appropriate G2/M checkpoint control. Regardless, the identification of this novel Rad50-interacting protein represents an important step toward a more complete description of the activities through which proper cell cycle checkpoint control is achieved.

https://openalex.org/W1971670562,"The newly discovered laminin α5 chain is a multidomain, extracellular matrix protein implicated in various biological functions such as the development of blood vessels and nerves. The N-terminal globular domain of the laminin α chains has an important role for biological activities through interactions with cell surface receptors. In this study, we identified residues that are critical for cell binding within the laminin α5 N-terminal globular domain VI (∼270 residues) using site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides. A recombinant protein of domain VI and the first four epidermal growth factor-like repeats of domain V, generated in a mammalian expression system, was highly active for HT-1080 cell binding, while a recombinant protein consisting of only the epidermal growth factor-like repeats showed no cell binding. By competition analysis with synthetic peptides for cell binding, we identified two sequences: S2,123GQVFHVAYVLIKF135 and S6,225RDFTKATNIRLRFLR239, within domain VI that inhibited cell binding to domain VI. Alanine substitution mutagenesis indicated that four residues (Tyr130, Arg225, Lys229, and Arg239) within these two sequences are crucial for cell binding. Real-time heparin-binding kinetics of the domain VI mutants analyzed by surface plasmon resonance indicated that Arg239 of S6 was critical for both heparin and cell binding. In addition, cell binding to domain VI was inhibited by heparin/heparan sulfate, which suggests an overlap of cell and heparin-binding sites. Furthermore, inhibition studies using integrin subunit monoclonal antibodies showed that integrin α3β1 was a major receptor for domain VI binding. Our results provide evidence that two sites spaced about 90 residues apart within the laminin α5 chain N-terminal globular domain VI are critical for cell surface receptor binding.

By competition analysis with synthetic peptides for cell binding, we identified two sequences: S2,123GQVFHVAYVLIKF135 and S6,225RDFTKATNIRLRFLR239, within domain VI that inhibited cell binding to domain VI. Alanine substitution mutagenesis indicated that four residues (Tyr130, Arg225, Lys229, and Arg239) within these two sequences are crucial for cell binding. Real-time heparin-binding kinetics of the domain VI mutants analyzed by surface plasmon resonance indicated that Arg239 of S6 was critical for both heparin and cell binding. In addition, cell binding to domain VI was inhibited by heparin/heparan sulfate, which suggests an overlap of cell and heparin-binding sites. Furthermore, inhibition studies using integrin subunit monoclonal antibodies showed that integrin α3β1 was a major receptor for domain VI binding. Our results provide evidence that two sites spaced about 90 residues apart within the laminin α5 chain N-terminal globular domain VI are critical for cell surface receptor binding. epidermal growth factor phosphate-buffered saline Laminins are heterotrimeric basement membrane proteins that exert multiple biological functions through interactions with other matrix molecules and cell surface receptors. The regulation of these interactions is critical to many biological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, angiogenesis, tumor progression, and neurite outgrowth (for review, see Ref. 1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). The laminin family contains at least 11 chains (five α, three β, and three γ chains). The newly discovered α5 chain is the most widely expressed member of the laminin α chain family (2Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J. Snider W.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Sanes J.R. J.

Mutant mice that lack the α5 chain have defects in neural tube closure, digit septation, placentation, and glomerulogenesis, suggesting that the α5 chain has multifunctional roles in tissue development (3Miner J.H.

The laminin α5 chain associates with the γ1 chain and either β1 or β2chains to form laminin-10 and laminin-11, respectively (2Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J. Snider W.D. Jenkins N.A.

Laminin-10/11 is a ligand for several cell surface receptors, including α-dystroglycan (5Shimizu H. Hosokawa H. Ninomiya H. Miner J.H. Masaki T. J. Biol.

Laminin-11 has been shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth in vitro, while other laminin isoforms promote neurite outgrowth, suggesting a unique role of the α5chain in neural development (see Refs. 8Patton B.L.

Interestingly, SV2, a transmembrane keratan sulfate proteoglycan found in synaptic vesicles, has recently been proposed to act as a laminin α5 receptor, suggesting a role of the laminin α5 chain in nerve regeneration (11Son Y.J.

The N-terminal globular domain (domain VI, ∼250–270 residues) is specific for laminin and is the most conserved (∼60% sequence identity) among the laminin domains (12Miner J.H. Lewis R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28523-28526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Studies with function-blocking antibodies and cell binding assays have indicated that domain VI of both the laminin α1 and α2 chains contains binding sites for the α1β1 and α2β1integrins (13Colognato-Pyke H.

In addition to binding functions for cell surface receptor and for matrix proteins, domain VI is also essential for the self-assembly of laminins (13Colognato-Pyke H. O'Rear J.J. Yamada Y.

Previous studies showed that the synthetic peptide RQVFQVAYIIIKA (A-13), derived from domain VI of the laminin α1 chain, binds β1 subunit-containing integrins (19Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Malinda K.M. Song S.Y. Miyoshi K. Otaka A. Powell S.K. Hoffman M.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32491-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The active core sequence (VAYI) of this peptide is conserved in the α5 chain, but the functional importance of this site within domain VI has not yet been examined. In the present work, we studied cell binding functions of mouse laminin α5 domain VI using site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides. We found that two sites, spaced by ∼90 amino acids, are required for cell binding. We also identified four residues within the two sites that are essential for the binding. In addition, we demonstrated that an arginine residue of one of the sites is critical for both heparin and cell binding. Our findings suggest that the protein conformation surrounding these sites is important for cell binding through integrin and heparan sulfate-containing cell surface receptors. Mouse kidney cDNA was used as a template in polymerase chain reaction to amplify sequences encoding domain VI and the first four EGF1-like repeats of domain V of the laminin α1 and α5 chain. Polymerase chain reaction was performed withPfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following primers: 1, GAGAGAAAGCTTCGCACTCCCGGGGGCGATGGC; 2, GAGAGACTCGAGAGTGGCAGCTAGGCCCGTGGAATC; 3, GAGAGAAAGCTTCAGCAGAGAGGCTTGTTCCCTGC; 4, GAGAGACTCGAGAGGAGCAGCCCTCGGGGTTTCG. Primers 1 and 2 were used for laminin α5 domain VI (Arg1-His514), and primers 3 and 4 for the laminin α1 domain VI (Gln1-Ser484). For polymerase chain reaction amplification of the EGF-like repeats of laminin α5domain V (Arg273-His514), primers 2 and 5, GAGAGAAAGCTTCGCTGTGTCTGTCATGGCCACG, were used. In addition to the coding sequences, these primers contained either a HindIII or a XhoI restriction site. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with HindIII and XhoI and ligated into the expression vector pSecTag2/Hygro B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting expression vectors encode the Igκ chain leader sequence, a laminin domain, and a c-myc epitope followed by a hexahistidine affinity tag sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quickchange kit method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the N-terminal globular domain VI and the first four EGF-like repeats of domain V of the mouse laminin α5chain, which has been cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene). The following laminin α5 residues were individually substituted with alanine: Tyr130, Arg225, Lys229, Arg234, Arg236, and Arg239. All expression constructions and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The expression vectors were transiently transfected into monkey kidney COS-7 cells (CRL-1651, ATCC) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Generation of secreted recombinant His-tagged laminin domains was confirmed by Western blotting of serum-free conditioned medium using an anti-His(C-terminal)-horseradish peroxidase monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). For recombinant production, conditioned medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal calf serum) was collected 7 days after transfection. The medium was cleared of detached cells and debris through centrifugation, and 1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 m NaCl were added to final concentrations of 50 mm and 0.5 m, respectively. In addition, 0.2 m phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 3 m imidazole, pH 6.0, were added to concentrations of 1 and 10 mm, respectively. Nickel-charged agarose resin (Probond, Invitrogen) was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mmimidazole, pH 8.0, and incubated with the conditioned medium. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the resin was transferred to a column and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 mNaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. The His-tagged proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Purified proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and quantified using a BCA protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Purity was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by colloidal Coomassie G-250 Blue (GelCode Blue, Pierce, Rockford, IL) staining and judged to >95%. Single-site substitutions may result in a change of the overall fold of domain VI. Gel filtration analysis of mutants, including Y130A and R239A, were therefore performed in 0.05 m phosphate buffer with 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.0, using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column on an ÄKTA EXPLORER design system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The majority of the mutants and the wild-type domain VI eluted at a volume corresponding to a molecular weight of ∼65,000 (data not shown). The results indicate that these molecules are monomers without mis-folding. Peptide synthesis was performed on ABI model 433A peptide synthesizers at the Facility for Biotechnology Resources (U. S. Food and Drug Administration). All the peptides were prepared with a C-terminal amide group. The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and characterized by mass spectrometry. Biotinylated heparin (Celsus Laboratories, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) at 40 μg/ml in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, including 0.005% surfactant P20) was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (Sensor Chip SA, BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 10 μl/min for 4 min to an immobilization level of 300 resonance units. In the affinity measurements, recombinant proteins at different concentrations (50–200 nm) were injected on the heparin-coated surface at 30 μl/min in the running buffer at 25 °C, and the binding and dissociation were registered (2 min each) in a BIAcoreTM 1000 instrument (BIAcore, Inc.). The streptavidin-heparin surface was regenerated at the end of each run by two successive injections of 30 μl of 20 mm NaOH containing 1 m NaCl. In control experiments with the same concentrations of recombinant proteins, but with a blank streptavidin sensor chip, no binding was seen. The sensorgrams obtained were analyzed by nonlinear least square curve fitting using BIAevaluation 2.1 software assuming single-site association and dissociation models. HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells (CCL-121, ATCC) were detached with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin, 0.02% (w/v) EDTA in PBS, washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, resuspended to a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/ml, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. For evaluation of the effects of synthetic peptides or monoclonal antibodies against integrin subunits, cells were incubated with peptides or antibodies at 37 °C for 30 min. Function-blocking monoclonal antibodies against integrin α1 (FB12), α2 (P1E6), α3 (P1B5), α3(ASC-1), α4 (P1H4), α5 (P1D6), α6 (NKI-GoH3), αV (P3G8), and β4 (ASC-3) were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA. Anti-integrin α2 (A2-IIE10) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, and anti-integrin β1 (mAb13) was a gift from Dr. K. Yamada, National Institutes of Health. Assays were performed in 96-well round-bottom microtiter plates (Immulon-2HB, Dynex Technologies, Inc., Chantilly, VA). Wells were coated for 1 h at room temperature with 50 μl of recombinant proteins or laminin-10/11 (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog number 12163-010, Life Technologies) diluted with Dulbecco's PBS (Dulbecco's PBS) and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 200 μl of 1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin. After washing (Dulbecco's PBS), cells (100 μl) were added and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2. Wells were washed gently twice with Dulbecco's PBS and stained for 10 min with 0.2% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma) in 20% (v/v) methanol. After washing with H2O, cells were dissolved in 10% SDS (w/v), and the absorbance at 600 nm was measured. Each sample was assayed in triplicate, and attachment to bovine serum albumin was subtracted from all measurements. Constructs were generated for expression of mouse laminin α5 domain VI and the first four EGF-like repeats of domain V in mammalian cells (Fig. 1). In addition, a similar construct was also generated for laminin α1 domain VI, which corresponds to that described previously (15Ettner N. Gohring W. Sasaki T. Mann K. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The secreted recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-agarose chromatography from the conditioned medium of transfected COS-7 cells with a yield of 1–2 μg/ml medium. The purity of the protein preparations was more than 95% as judged from Coomassie Blue-stained gels after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Recombinant fragments containing domains VI through IV of the laminin α1 and α2 chains have previously been shown to promote binding of HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells (13Colognato-Pyke H. O'Rear J.J.

This cell line was therefore used to analyze the adhesive properties of the recombinant laminin α5 domain VI. HT-1080 cells showed strong binding to domain VI, while the recombinant domain V, consisting of the EGF-like repeats, showed no cell binding, demonstrating that the cell binding activities reside in domain VI (Fig. 1). To localize potential cell-binding sites on laminin α5 domain VI, we screened synthetic peptides for their inhibitory effect on HT-1080 cell binding to domain VI. We synthesized 15 peptides that corresponded to possible integrin recognition sequences (for review, see Ref. 20Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) within laminin α5 domain VI and to active sequences previously identified in laminin α1 domain VI (TableI). Four peptides (S1, S2, S6, and S7) were found to inhibit HT-1080 cell binding to domain VI (Fig.2), whereas the other peptides showed no or only small effects on the cell-domain interaction. A GRGDS peptide, which is reported to block the function of various integrins, had no effect on cell binding. The sequences of peptides S1 and S2 overlap with four residues, but only S2 showed strong activity when tested in a direct cell binding assay (data not shown). The S6 and S7 peptides overlap by eight residues and showed no activity when tested for direct cell binding (data not shown). None of the peptides inhibited cell binding to laminin-10/11, suggesting that other cell-binding sites are available on the intact molecule (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that two sequences: S2,123GQVFHVAYVLIKF135 and S6,225RDFTKATNIRLRFLR239, separated by ∼90 residues, directly interact with cell surface receptors within domain VI.Table ISynthetic peptides of the laminin α5 N-terminal domain VINameSequenceResiduesS1EVNVTLDLGQVFH115–127S2GQVFHVAYVLIKF123–135S3QPWQFFASSKRD157–168S4LERFGPRTLERI170–181S5LRDFTKATNIRL224–235S6RDFTKATNIRLRFLR225–239S7NIRLRFLRTNTL232–243S8GKALRDPTVTRR249–260S9TVTRRYYYSIKD256–267S10HPVSNAIDGTER89–100S11PRPDLWVLERSTDFGHTY139–156S12STDFGHTYQPWQF149–161S13PRTLERITQDDDVI175–188S14TTEYSRIVPLENGEI190–204S15PPLSRGLEYNEV105–116The underlined sequences compete with HT-1080 cell-domain VI interactions. Open table in a new tab The underlined sequences compete with HT-1080 cell-domain VI interactions. We next examined the functional role of these two sites within domain VI by alanine substitution mutagenesis. Our laboratory has previously identified several synthetic peptides active for cell binding within domain VI of the mouse laminin α1 chain (19Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Malinda K.M. Song S.Y. Miyoshi K.

The S2 peptide corresponds to the highly active peptide A-13 (RQVFQVAYIIIKA) of laminin α1 domain VI. Deletion analysis revealed that the VAYI sequence within A-13 is critical for high cell binding activity (19Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Malinda K.M. Song S.Y. Miyoshi K. Otaka A. Powell S.K. Hoffman M.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32491-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The active core sequence VAYI is conserved in the laminin α5 chain with the exception of a substitution of Ile with Val (Fig. 3). To test the importance of the tyrosine in the VAYI site, we generated a single substitution mutant by replacing tyrosine with alanine (Y130A). This showed that Tyr130 plays a significant role for cell binding, as the mutant domain VI with Y130A (A5VI-Y130A) reduced cell binding to ∼25% of that of wild-type domain VI (Fig.4).Figure 4Cell binding to laminin α5 domain VI mutants. Wells were coated with laminin α5 domain VI mutants (10 μg/ml). HT-1080 cells were added, and crystal violet staining was used to assess the number of attached cells after 1 h. Data are given as percentage of cell binding to the wild-type laminin α5domain VI (A5VI). Each value represents the mean of three separate determinations ± S.D. Duplicate experiments gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The S6 peptide overlaps with two previously reported active synthetic peptides (A-24 and A-25) derived from the laminin α1chain (19Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Malinda K.M. Song S.Y. Miyoshi K. Otaka A. Powell S.K. Hoffman M.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32491-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The S6 sequence is characterized by five basic residues (four Arg and one Lys). Notable, three of the four Arg residues are conserved in domain VI of all the laminin α chains (Fig. 3). To analyze the contribution of the individual Arg/Lys residues within the S6 site to cell binding, we generated five single substitution mutants by replacing Arg/Lys residues with Ala (R225A, K229A, R234A, R236A, and R239A). All the mutants were expressed at a level similar to wild-type domain VI, suggesting that the mutations did not cause unstable synthesis of domain VI due to unfolding of the proteins (data not shown). Cell binding to A5VI-K229A was very poor, while neither A5VI-R234A nor A5VI-R236A had a significant effect on cell binding (Fig. 4). R225A and R239A also showed a significant reduction in cell binding, by ∼60% of the wild type (Fig. 4). These data indicate that four residues, Tyr130, Arg225, Lys229, and Arg239, within these two regions are crucial for cell binding. Since heparin binding activity has been localized to domain VI of the laminin α1 and α2 chains (13Colognato-Pyke H. O'Rear J.J. Yamada Y. Carbonetto S. Cheng Y.S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), cell binding to recombinant laminin α5 domain VI was examined in the presence of heparin and other heparin-like glycosaminoglycans. Heparin and heparan sulfate inhibited HT-1080 cell binding to domain VI, whereas keratan sulfate was much less inhibitory (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the heparin-binding site overlaps with the cell-binding sites. To examine the relationships between the heparin and cell-binding site, the binding kinetics between immobilized biotinylated heparin and the laminin α5 domain VI mutants were measured directly by real-time biomolecular interaction analysis using surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcoreTM system. Similar equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd = 9–16 nm) were obtained for the interactions of wild-type domain VI of the laminin α5 chain and five of the mutants with heparin (Table II). Less than a 2-fold difference was observed for the kinetic binding constants between wild-type domain VI and five of the mutants including Y130A, R225A, K229A, R234A, and R236A. Statistically significant differences in kinetic constants derived from BIAcore experiments are generally considered to be at least 5–10-fold. This demonstrates that the heparin binding activity was unchanged, indicating that the structural integrity of domain VI was maintained in these mutants and that these positions were not part of the heparin-binding site. In contrast, no binding of the R239A mutant to heparin was observed even at a high protein concentration (200 nm). Mutation of Arg239 was also found to be critical for cell binding, reducing activity by ∼60% compared with wild-type domain VI (see above). Consistent with the cell binding results, no heparin binding was observed for a recombinant protein consisting of the first four EGF-like repeats of domain V. These results demonstrate that the heparin-binding site is located within domain VI. Interestingly, the binding affinity of domain VI of the laminin α1 chain to heparin was about 4-fold weaker (Kd = 45 nm), demonstrating differences in affinity for heparin between the laminin domain VI isoforms. Taken together, these results indicate that Arg239 within the S6 site is critical for both heparin and cell binding.Table IIEffect of mutagenesis on laminin α5 domain VI-heparin interactionMutantskakdKds−1m−1s−1nmA5VI7.9 × 10+47.1 × 10−49 ± 3A5VI-Y130A2.6 × 10+44.2 × 10−416 ± 4A5VI-R225A3.3 × 10+44.4 × 10−413 ± 3A5VI-K229A3.1 × 10+43.8 × 10−48 ± 2A5VI-R234A7.7 × 10+44.5 × 10−45 ± 2A5VI-R236A9.0 × 10+47.8 × 10−49 ± 4A5VI-R239ANo binding2-aNo uptake of resonance units was detected.A1VI10.4 × 10+447.1 × 10−445 ± 6A5VNo bindingKinectic constants were obtained by surface plasmon resonance analysis of real-time heparin-binding interactions of laminin α5domain VI mutants, domain V, and laminin α1 domain VI.

Cell binding to laminin α5 and α1 domain VI and to laminins containing either the α5 chain (laminin-10/11) or the α1 chain (laminin-1) was examined in the presence of different anti-integrin antibodies to identify integrin receptors involved in domain VI binding. The β1 integrin antibody demonstrated partial inhibition of HT-1080 cell binding to laminin-10/11 but strong inhibition of cell binding to laminin-1 (Fig.6). The monoclonal antibody against integrin α6 inhibited cell binding to laminin-1 but not laminin-10/11, while a monoclonal antibody against integrin α3 showed a weak inhibitory effect on cell binding to laminin-10/11. Other antibodies against integrin subunits, including β4, α1, α2, α4, α5, and αV, had no effect on cell binding. Cell binding to both laminin-1 and laminin-10/11 was dependent on divalent cations, since it was abolished by 5 mm EDTA (Fig.6), which supports the role of integrins or α-dystroglycan as receptors. These results suggest that different integrin receptors mediate HT-1080 cell binding to laminin-1 and laminin-10/11 and that the α3β1 integrin binds laminin-10/11, agreeing with previous reports (6Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15854-15859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 869-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody against the β1 integrin subunit inhibited HT-1080 binding to recombinant domain VI of both laminin α5 and α1 (Fig.7, A and B). These results show that β1 subunit containing integrins is critical for cell binding to domain VI of both chains. Furthermore, 5 mm EDTA was also found to inhibit cell binding, supporting cation and integrin dependence of the interaction (Fig. 5). We then tested several monoclonal antibodies against integrin α subunits to identify partners for the β1 integrins. Anti-integrin α3 antibodies strongly inhibited HT-1080 cell binding to laminin α5 and α1 domain VI (Fig. 7,A and B). Monoclonal antibodies against α1, α5, and αV had no or only small effects on cell binding, indicating that these integrins were not major mediators of cell binding to laminin α5 and α1 domain VI (Fig. 7, A and B). HT-1080 cell binding to laminin α5 and α1domain VI was reduced to about 30–50% by anti-integrin α2 and α4 antibodies. Integrin α6 antibody also weakly reduced cell binding to laminin α5 domain VI but not to laminin α1 domain VI (Fig. 7 B). Taken together, these results identify α3β1 integrin as a major receptor to α5 domain VI. The newly discovered laminin α5 chain has been implicated in various biological activities, such as angiogenesis and nerve regeneration. Previously, we identified a cell-binding site within the C-terminal G domain of the mouse laminin α5chain using recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides (21Nielsen P.K. Gho Y.S. Hoffman M.P. Watanabe H. Makino M. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14517-14523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified cell-binding sites on the laminin α5 N-terminal globular domain VI. Recombinant proteins of laminin α5 domain VI and the first four EGF-like repeats of domain V were generated by mammalian expression. The recombinant protein was highly active for HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell binding, while a recombinant protein consisting of only the EGF-like repeats showed no binding, indicating that domain VI contributed to the cell-binding site. This result is similar to previous reports from studies on recombinant fragments consisting of domains VI through IV, of the laminin α1 and α2 chains (13Colognato-Pyke H. O'Rear J.J. Yamada Y.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, recombinant laminin α5 domain VI was also found to bind other cell lines including mouse B16-F10 melanoma and mesangial cells, while weak binding was observed for a human submandibular gland cell line, indicating cell type-specific interaction of this domain (data not shown). To localize cell-binding sites on laminin α5 domain VI, we screened domain VI-derived synthetic peptides for their effect on HT-1080 cell/domain VI interactions. Four peptides: S1,115EVNVTLDLGQVFH127; S2,123GQVFHVAYVLIKF135; S6,225RDFTKATNIRLRFLR239; and S7,232NIRLRFLRTNTL243, inhibited cell binding. These peptides corresponded to sequences in the laminin α1 chain (A-12, A-13, A-24, and A-25) previously reported to be highly active for cell binding (19Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Malinda K.M. Song S.Y.

The S1 and S2 peptides overlap, as do S6 and S7, thus the results indicate that at least two sequences, 123GQVFHVAYVLIKF135 and225RDFTKATNIRLRFLR239, spaced by ∼90 residues, directly interact with cell surface receptors within domain VI (Fig. 3). Alanine mutagenesis of recombinant domain VI identified four positions within these two sequences as critically involved in cell binding: Tyr130, Arg225, Lys229, and Arg239. A comparison with the sequences of domain VI of the laminin α1, α2, and α3B chains reveals that Tyr130 and Arg239 are conserved, while Arg225 and Lys229 are conserved between the α3 and α5 chains, indicating that the position of the cell-binding sites varies. These differences may be important for regulation and specificity of receptor interactions within domain VI. The site-directed mutagenesis data also demonstrate that the two sites together contribute to a cell binding epitope and imply that these cell-binding sites are highly dependent on the conformation of domain VI. The importance of the three-dimensional structure of cell-binding sites has also been shown for other integrin ligands, including fibronectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, where multiple contacts, involving several different ligand peptide segments, are formed between ligand and receptor (22Newham P. Craig S.E. Seddon G.N. Schofield N.R. Rees A. Edwards R.M. Jones E.Y. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Kinetic data obtained here by surface plasmon resonance analysis for six single-site alanine substitution mutants of laminin α5 domain VI demonstrate that one position (Arg239) within the cell-binding site is also critical for heparin interactions. Cell binding to domain VI was sensitive to inhibition by heparin/heparan sulfate, demonstrating overlap of cell and heparin-binding sites. Interestingly, the binding constants for binding to heparin show a 4-fold difference between domain VI of the laminin α5 and α1 chain, with the α5 domain demonstrating highest affinity. Strong heparin binding affinity suggests the potential to bind heparan sulfate containing matrix molecules or cell surface receptors (21Nielsen P.K. Gho Y.S. Hoffman M.P. Watanabe H. Makino M.

Biol. 1999; 287: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); accordingly, these molecules may interact mainly with the basic residues within the S6 site. Our results suggest that heparan sulfate-containing cell surface receptor interaction is required for efficient cell binding to laminin α5 domain VI. This is in accordance with previous studies, which indicate that heparan sulfate-containing cell surface receptors can function as co-receptors for integrins and that these co-receptors are essential for cell binding to some ligands, including the heparin III domain of fibronectin and the angiogenic inducer Cyr61 (17Moyano J.V.

Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The heparan sulfate-containing cell surface receptors may include syndecan-1 or α-dystroglycan; the latter has been shown to bind laminin-10/11 and domain VI of the laminin α1 chain (8Patton B.L. Miner J.H. Chiu A.Y. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1507-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 24Talts J.F. Andac Z. Gohring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The role of these interactions may be important for cell type-specific binding or signaling (17Moyano J.V. Carnemolla B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The heparin-binding site on laminin α5 domain VI may also function as a binding site for other matrix molecules, since it has been reported that laminin α1 domain VI binds to heparan sulfate chains of perlecan (24Talts J.F. Andac Z. Gohring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Accordingly, binding through the heparin-binding site may be a mechanism for the regulation of interactions with cells and matrix assembly. Several integrins have previously been implicated as receptors for laminin-10/11, including α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4(7Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Fujiwara H. Sonnenberg A. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 869-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that domain VI of the laminin α5 chain is a binding site for integrins α3β1, α2β1, α4β1, and α6β1. HT-1080 cell binding was completely blocked by anti-integrin α3 or β1 antibodies, while function-blocking antibodies against the α2, α4, and α6 integrins showed a weaker effect, suggesting that the α3β1 integrin is a major mediator of cell binding. Small or no effects were observed with antibodies against α1, α5, and αV integrins. Comparison with a recombinant protein of laminin α1 domain VI showed similar integrin specificity except for α6, where no effect was observed for laminin α1 domain VI. The inhibition results are in agreement with the reported integrin specificity of recombinant fragments of domains VI through IV, of the laminin α1 and α2 chains (13Colognato-Pyke H. O'Rear J.J.

The previous studies used the same cell line as here, but only results using anti-integrin α1 and α2 antibodies were reported. Our results using various monoclonal antibodies suggest that several integrins bind domain VI of the laminin α5 and α1 chains and that these receptors bind similar recognition sites within domain VI. In conclusion, the present data represent the first mapping of sites within the N-terminal globular domain VI of the mouse laminin α5 chain responsible for cell binding. Our results suggest that heparan sulfate-containing receptors and integrins recognize domain VI. We found that two sequences, spaced by ∼90 residues within laminin α5 domain VI, are critical for cell surface receptor binding and that at least four residues within these two regions together form a binding site(s) critical for receptor binding."

The immunodominant GPAautoepitope is encompassed by residues 17–31 (the EAregion) within the noncollagenous (NC1) domain of the α3(IV) chain. The GP epitope is cryptic in the NC1 hexamer complex that occurs in the type IV collagen network found in tissues and inaccessible to autoantibodies unless the hexamer dissociates. In contrast, the epitope for the Mab3 monoclonal antibody is also located within the EA region, but is fully accessible in the hexamer complex. In this study, the identity of residues that compose the GPA autoepitope was determined, and the molecular basis of its cryptic nature was explored. This was achieved using site-directed mutagenesis to exchange the α3(IV) residues in the EAregion with the corresponding residues of the homologous but non-immunoreactive α1(IV) NC1 domain and then comparing the reactivity of the mutated chimeras with GPA and Mab3 antibodies. It was shown that three hydrophobic residues (Ala18, Ile19, and Val27) and Pro28 are critical for the GPA autoepitope, whereas two hydrophilic residues (Ser21 and Ser31) along with Pro28 are critical for the Mab3 epitope. These results suggest that the cryptic nature of the GPA autoepitope is the result of quaternary interactions of the α3, α4, and α5 NC1 domains of the hexamer complex that bury the one or more hydrophobic residues. These findings provide critical information for understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease as well as for designing drugs that would mimic the epitope and thus block the binding of GP autoantibodies to autoantigen.

Goodpasture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Goodpasture (GP)1disease is defined by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, with or without lung hemorrhage, which is caused by autoantibodies targeted to type IV collagen of the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. Left untreated, the disease is potentially lethal. If diagnosed early, GP patients can be treated by immunosuppression and plasma exchange to remove the toxic autoantibodies. This therapy has side effects, including a weakening of the natural defenses; thus, a more specific therapy is highly desirable. A detailed knowledge of the epitope would facilitate the development of therapies that selectively remove, neutralize, or prevent synthesis of the pathogenic autoantibodies and provide a foundation for studies to determine the etiology of the disease. The GP autoantigen is the α3 chain of type IV collagen (1Butkowski R.J. Langeveld J.P. Wieslander J. Hamilton J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GP autoepitopes are conformational and reside within the 232-residue long noncollagenous (NC1) domain at the C-terminus of the α3(IV) chain. Three chains of type IV collagen assemble into triple-helical protomers (molecule) that further interact with each other at the amino and carboxyl termini to form supramolecular networks. In the glomerular basement membrane, which is the main target of autoantibodies, the α3(IV) chain associates with the α4(IV) and α5(IV) chains to form a cross-linked α3·α4·α5(IV) network (4Gunwar S.

The GP epitopes are cryptic in the α3·α4·α5 NC1 hexamer complex formed by the interaction of two triple-helical protomers through the NC1 domains (Fig. 1, top). As a result, the epitopes are inaccessible for binding of autoantibodies unless the hexamer dissociates (5Wieslander J. Langeveld J. Butkowski R. Jodlowski M. Noelken M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Unmasking of previously hidden GP epitopes is thought to be of fundamental importance for understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of GP disease. Two conformational GP autoepitopes have recently been mapped to two regions of the α3(IV) NC1 domain, designated EA and EB, by homolog-scanning mutagenesis using chimeric α1/α3 NC1 domains in which the non-immunoreactive α1 NC1 domain was used as a scaffold for exchanging short homologous α1 sequences with α3 NC1 segments to ensure correct folding of the epitope. The immunodominant autoepitope, designated GPA (7Borza D.-B. Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Todd P. Cervera J. Saus J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Autoantibodies specific for the EA region, designated GPA, are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of GP disease because they are the predominant subpopulation (∼60–65%) in all sera and have high affinity for autoantigen (7Borza D.-B.

Moreover, high titers of GPA antibodies are correlated with an unfavorable disease outcome (9Hellmark T. Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J.

Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 936-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and was further mapped to residues 127–141, designated the EB region (7Borza D.-B. Netzer K.O.

In contrast to the cryptic GP autoepitopes, the epitope for Mab3 monoclonal antibody, which is also localized to the EA and EB regions, is fully accessible even in the NC1 hexamer (7Borza D.-B. Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Todd P. Cervera J. Saus J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6030-6037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that only certain amino acid residues of the EA and EB regions constitute the GPA and GPB autoepitopes and that their cryptic nature in the NC1 hexamer complex is a result of either direct interactions with or close proximity to other NC1 domains in the hexamer, which prevents the access of autoantibodies. Moreover, these critical residues must be distinctly different from those that constitute the Mab3 epitope, which are accessible on the surface of the hexamer complex. The aim of this study was to identify which residues compose the GPA autoepitope and to explore the molecular basis of its cryptic nature. This was accomplished using homolog-scanning mutagenesis to change the α3(IV)-specific residues within the EA region of an α1/α3 chimera, one at a time, to the corresponding residues from the homologous but non-immunoreactive α1(IV) NC1 domain. The reactivity of mutated NC1 domains with GPA and Mab3 antibodies was then compared. It was shown that three hydrophobic residues (Ala18, Ile19, and Val27) and Pro28 are critical for the GPA autoepitope, whereas two hydrophilic residues (Ser21 and Ser31) along with Pro28are critical for the Mab3 epitope. These results suggest that the cryptic nature of the GPA autoepitope is the result of quaternary interactions among the α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) NC1 domains of the α3·α4·α5 hexamer complex that bury the one or more hydrophobic residues. These findings provide critical information for understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease as well as for designing drugs that would mimic the epitope and thus block the binding of GP autoantibodies to autoantigen in vivo. Eight chimeric constructs with individual α3(IV) to α1(IV) amino acid substitutions in the EA epitope region, designated M1–M8 (see Fig. 2), were constructed using the GeneEditorTM in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

The serum or the plasmapheresis fluid from 13 patients diagnosed with Goodpasture disease (GP1–13) was used. The titer of GP antibodies was measured by ELISA in microtiter plates coated with α3(IV) NC1 domain (100 ng/well); and for further analyses, sera were appropriately diluted to yield approximately equal reactivity. The relative autoantibody reactivity to the EAand EB regions was measured by ELISA using the C2 and C6 chimeras, respectively (10Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.-B. Todd P. Gunwar S. Langeveld J.P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11267-11274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). GP sera that reacted predominantly with EA (GPA autoantibodies) were used without further purification. GP sera that showed significant reactivity against the EB region required further purification by absorption of GPB antibodies to a column with immobilized C6 as previously described (7Borza D.-B.

The unbound fraction, consisting of GPA antibodies, was used in the subsequent immunoassays for mapping the epitope location. The bound GPB fraction was eluted from the C6 affinity column with 3 m guanidinium chloride and used as a control to establish the correct folding of the mutated chimeras. The proteins (300 ng), separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG and Mab3 monoclonal antibodies as well as with GP sera as previously described (10Netzer K.O.

The α1(IV) NC1 domain and chimera C6 (negative controls), chimera C2·6 and the α3(IV) NC1 domain (positive controls), and mutated chimeras M1–M8 were coated in duplicates onto MaxisorpTM ELISA plates (Nunc) at 100 ng/well in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Binding of GP autoantibodies or Mab3 was determined by direct ELISA as previously described (7Borza D.-B. Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Todd P. Cervera J. Saus J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6030-6037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Detection was performed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed byp-nitrophenol phosphate, and color development was monitored at 410 nm with a Dynatech MR4000 plate reader. Each serum was analyzed at least four times, with the median of the results being taken as the serum's representative value. For inhibition ELISA, the GP sera or purified GP antibody fractions were incubated overnight at room temperature with various amounts of recombinant NC1 domains or chimeras prior to addition to plates coated with the C2·6 chimera. The relative optical density of the mutated protein chimeras with respect to the binding of GP autoantibodies was calculated as the ratio of the absorption upon ELISA of each mutated chimera to that of the template C2·6 chimera. Results are reported as the mean ± S.D. of the serum's median values. Statistics were calculated using the SPSS software package (Version 9.0). The overall significance of differences in relative binding for M1–M8 was analyzed by repeated measures-analysis of variance. Reduced binding to individual chimeras, relative to the template C2·6 chimera, was tested by one-sample t tests. Possible serum subgroups based on nonparallel binding profiles for M1–M8 were revealed by hierarchical cluster analysis and followed up with independent-sample t tests and Pearson correlations to identify the specific chimeras responsible for significantly divergent profiles. All statistical tests were two-tailed. Significance was inferred when p was <0.05. A 15-residue region of α3(IV) NC1, designated EA (residues 17–31), was sufficient to confer reactivity for the immunodominant population of GP autoantibodies (GPA) when substituted into the non-immunoreactive scaffold of the α1(IV) NC1 domain (7Borza D.-B. Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Todd P. Cervera J. Saus J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6030-6037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Netzer K.O. Leinonen A.

Thus, the EA region encompasses the autoepitope for GPA antibodies. The EA region also contains residues that constitute the epitope for the Mab3 monoclonal antibody, along with other critical residues from the EB region (7Borza D.-B. Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Todd P. Cervera J. Saus J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6030-6037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although GPAand Mab3 antibodies bind to the same EA region, their respective epitopes are distinct because of dissimilar accessibility for antibody binding in the NC1 hexamer complex; this suggests that the EA region comprises buried (or sterically hindered) residues that compose the GPA autoepitope as well as surface-exposed residues that compose the Mab3 epitope (7Borza D.-B. Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Todd P. Cervera J. Saus J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6030-6037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Here, homolog-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify which of the eight α3-specific residues within the EA region constitute the epitopes for GPA and Mab3 antibodies. The C2·6 chimera, which contains the EA and EB regions of the α3(IV) NC1 domain in a scaffold of the α1(IV) NC1 domain (Fig. 2,top), was used as a template for mutagenesis. The EB region was included in the chimera because it, along with the EA region, is required for binding of the Mab3 antibody (7Borza D.-B. Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Todd P. Cervera J. Saus J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6030-6037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, the EB region encompasses residues that constitute the conformational epitope for GPBautoantibodies. Thus, the binding of GPB antibodies can serve as a control for assessment of overall conformation of proteins mutated in the EA region (see below). In this study, each of the eight α3-specific residues of the EA region was substituted with the corresponding α1 residue. The mutated chimeras, designated M1–M8 (Fig. 2, bottom), were then analyzed for their ability to bind GPA and Mab3 antibodies as well as the control GPB antibodies. The mutated chimeras were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. After purification from the culture medium by affinity chromatography on an anti-FLAG column, the M1–M8 mutants appeared as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel at the predicted molecular mass of ∼25 kDa (Fig.3 A) and showed reactivity with anti-FLAG antibodies on Western blots (Fig. 3 B). All mutated chimeras reacted with GPB antibodies as well as or better than the template C2·6 chimera (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the mutations did not cause protein misfolding. Moreover, certain chimeras reacted with GPA antibodies, but not with Mab3 antibodies and vice versa (as described in detail below), further establishing that the loss of reactivity after mutagenesis was due to removal of a critical binding site and not to protein misfolding. The epitopes of GPA, GPB, and Mab3 antibodies are conformational and present only in correctly folded protein, as shown by the contrast between the recombinant α3(IV) NC1 domain expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, which is correctly folded, and that expressed in E. coli, which is misfolded (10Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.-B. Todd P. Gunwar S. Langeveld J.P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11267-11274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The misfolded protein did not react with GPA, GPB, and Mab3 antibodies, although it reacted with monoclonal antibodies that recognize linear epitopes, M3/1 and 175 (Fig.3 D). To determine which amino acids of the EA region are critical for the GPA autoepitope, the reactivity of the M1–M8 chimeras with sera from 13 GP patients was analyzed by ELISA (Fig. 4). To allow comparison of data across multiple experiments, the reactivity of the mutants was expressed relative to that of the template C2·6 chimera, which constitutes the positive control because it contains the complete EA regions of α3 along with the EB region. Chimera C6, containing the EB but not the EAregion of the α3(IV) NC1 domain, was used as a negative control. At least four measurements were performed for each serum. To exclude the interference of EB in the binding studies, EB-depleted GP sera and GP sera with little or no EB reactivity were used. For the overall group of 13 sera (Fig. 4 A), the binding profile for mutated chimeras was characterized by large reductions for M2 (57%; p < 0.001), M6 (44%; p < 0.001), and M7 (67%; p < 0.001) and a small reduction in binding for M1 (16%; p = 0.035). The notably large variability in binding associated with M3 (Fig. 4, A andB) suggested potentially important differences among the binding profiles of individual sera. This was confirmed by a cluster analysis, which revealed two independent serum groups (p = 0.008). The eight sera in group A (Fig.4 C) had large reductions in reactivity with the M2, M6, and M7 mutants (by 56, 57, and 58%, respectively; p < 0.001). Corrected for reactivity of the negative control (the C6 chimera), the respective reductions with M2, M6, and M7 were 83, 84, and 85%. In contrast, the five sera in group B (Fig. 4 D) had large reductions in reactivity with mutants M2 (60%), M3 (70%), and M7 (81%) (p < 0.001), along with small reductions with M1 (30%) and M6 (23%) (p < 0.05). Corrected for the reactivity of the negative control, in group B, the respective reductions with M2, M3, and M7 were 75, 85, and 96%. Group A differed significantly from group B regarding M3, M6, and M7 (p< 0.01). That M3 and M6 were singularly responsible for distinguishing the serum subgroups was shown by the large negative correlation between M3 and M6 in the group of 13 sera (r = −0.766;p = 0.002) (Fig. 4 B). The reduced reactivity of M2, M3, M6, and M7 was confirmed by inhibition ELISA (Fig.5). These findings indicate that Ala18, Ile19, Val27, and Pro28 constitute the critical residues of the GPA autoepitope. To determine which amino acids in the EA region are critical for the Mab3 epitope, the reactivity of the M1–M8 mutants with Mab3 was determined by Western blotting and ELISA (Fig.6). Three of the eight mutants, M4, M7, and M8, showed no reactivity by Western blotting and significantly decreased reactivity by ELISA (by 97, 85, and 62%, respectively, relative to the reactivity of the C2·6 chimera; p < 0.005). This indicates that Ser21, Pro28, and Ser31 are critical residues for the Mab3 epitope. With the exception of Pro28, this subset of amino acids is different from that composing the GPA autoepitope, confirming the supposition that the Mab3 and GPA epitopes are different, but colocalized within the 15-residue EA region. Consistent with the location of the Mab3 epitope on the surface of the NC1 hexamer, the two serine residues important for the binding of Mab3 are hydrophilic and thus predicted to be solvent-accessible in folded proteins. This result also provided additional evidence that the mutated chimeras were correctly folded, all showing reactivity with GPB and either GPA or Mab3 antibodies, which bind to conformational epitopes. Mutation of Pro18 abolished the interaction with both Mab3 and GPA, suggesting that this proline may be shared by both epitopes. Alternatively, Pro18 could play a structural role, being required for the correct conformation of the EA region within the α3(IV) NC1 domain. The mutation P28I did not seem to affect the overall secondary structure of the NC1 domain because the far-UV circular dichroism spectrum of the M7 mutant was similar to that of the parent C2·6 chimera and to that of the recombinant α3(IV) NC1 domain (data not shown). Moreover, if the P28I mutation had any effect on the conformation, this would be limited to the EA region, as binding of GPBautoantibodies to a neighboring EB epitope was not affected. The inaccessibility of the GPA autoepitope, contrasting with the full accessibility of the Mab3 epitope, afforded an experimental strategy to identify critical residues of these conformational epitopes and to explore the molecular basis of the cryptic nature of the GPA autoepitope. To this end, the 15-residue EA region of the α3(IV) NC1 domain was mutated at eight α3-specific residues, and the resulting chimeras (M1–M8) were assessed for their ability to bind GPA and Mab3 antibodies. The M2 (A18D), M3 (I19D), M6 (V27K), and M7 (P28I) chimeras had greatly decreased binding to GPA antibodies, whereas the M4 (S21Q), M7 (P28I), and M8 (S31H) chimeras had greatly decreased binding to Mab3 antibodies. The loss of binding of GPAantibodies to one set of chimeras and of Mab3 to another, along with binding of GPB antibodies to all chimeras, indicated that the overall conformation of the chimeras did not differ from that of the control (template) C2·6 chimera. Hence, a decrease in antibody binding to a specific chimera was due to removal of a critical epitope residue rather than to misfolding and/or mispairing of disulfide bonds. Thus, the binding profiles indicate that Ala18 and Pro28, along with either Ile19 in certain GP patients or Val27 in other GP patients, are critical for the GPA autoepitope, whereas Ser21, Ser31, and Pro28 are critical for the Mab3 epitope, as depicted in Fig. 7. Interestingly, three of the four GPA residues (Ala18, Ile19, and Val27) are hydrophobic (14Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17170) Google Scholar, 15Rose G.D. Geselowitz A.R. Lesser G.J. Lee R.H. Zehfus M.H. Science. 1985; 229: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) and have a high propensity to be buried (16Lesser G.J. Rose G.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This suggests that the cryptic nature of the GPA autoepitope is because one or more GPA residues participate in hydrophobic interactions with other NC1 domains in the hexamer complex, thus burying the epitope and rendering it inaccessible for binding of autoantibodies (Fig. 7). In contrast, the Mab3 epitope is accessible because it contains critical residues that have a high propensity to be located on the hexamer surface (16Lesser G.J. Rose G.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar): two hydrophilic serine residues and one proline residue, which is most often found in β-turns and other loops on the protein surface. Interestingly, Pro28 is critical for both GPA and Mab3 epitopes; thus, it may be important in defining the conformation of the EA region in the α3(IV) NC1 domain. The hydrophobic character of the GPA residues represents a departure from the conventional features of epitopes, which consist predominately of charged or polar residues and tend to be located in flexible turns or loops on protein surfaces (17Barlow D.J. Edwards M.S. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1986; 322: 747-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 18Hopp T.P. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 183-190PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these features, numerous empirical methods have been developed that successfully predict the major antigenic sites of native proteins (19Stern P.S. Trends Biotechnol. 1991; 9: 163-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The α3(IV) NC1 sequence was analyzed with the program Epiplot, which calculates and plots flexibility, hydrophilicity, and antigenicity profiles using 13 different scales, chosen as those yielding the best predictions on proteins whose antigenic structures are known (20Menendez-Arias L. Rodriguez R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 101-105PubMed Google Scholar). None of these methods predicted the location of the GPAautoepitope or the Mab3 epitope, which reside within the amphipathic EA region of the α3(IV) NC1 domain, as illustrated by the popular Hopp-Woods hydrophilicity plot in Fig.8 (upper) (21Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar). Thus, other factors must govern the immunogenicity of the EA region, eliciting the production of autoantibodies to GPA residues on one hand and of antibodies to Mab3 on the other. In particular, the lack of immune tolerance to the GPAepitope may be explained by its cryptic nature, which renders it an immunologically privileged site. To avoid autoreactivity, the B cell clones directed to self-antigens are edited out early in development, establishing self-tolerance. Because the GPA epitope is buried in the NC1 hexamer complex under normal physiological conditions, it is sequestered from the immune system. Therefore, if pathogenic factors induce hexamer dissociation, the newly exposed GPA residues would then be perceived as “foreign” by the immune system, eliciting an autoimmune response. What factors trigger this process in vivo remain unclear. Hydrocarbons or viral infections have been suggested as causative agents (22Wilson C.B. Borza D.-B. Hudson B.G. Theofilopoulos A.N. Bona A.C. The Molecular Pathology of Autoimmune Diseases. 2nd Ed. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Inc./Harwood Academic Publishers, Newark, NJ2000: 981-1010Google Scholar). A recent study provides evidence that reactive oxygen species may act as the physiological mediator for epitope exposure (23Kalluri R. Cantley L.G. Kerjaschki D. Neilson E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20027-20032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Certain of the GPA residues identified herein differ from those found in two recent studies by Wieslander and co-workers (11Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,24Gunnarsson A. Hellmark T. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30844-30848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), who did not identify the overall hydrophobic character of the epitope. The first study qualitatively investigated the role of 14 α3(IV) NC1 domain residues, including six of the eight residues in the EA region (11Hellmark T. Burkhardt H. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25862-25868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similar to our findings, Ile19 and Pro28, but not Thr17, were found important for binding. However, Ala18 was reported to be not essential, and the role of Glu24 and Val27 was not addressed. In addition, Ser21 and Ser31 were reported to be critical for binding GP antibodies, whereas we found these residues to be important only for the binding of the Mab3 antibody. Since a quantitative data analysis was not reported in that study, it is difficult to directly compare their findings with ours. A very recent paper from the same group (24Gunnarsson A. Hellmark T. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30844-30848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) quantitatively analyzed the role of four α3 residues in the EA region and found Val27 to be critical for GP antibody binding (similar to our findings), whereas Thr17, Ala18, and Glu24 had a moderate effect. Some of the discrepancies may be explained by the different α1/α3 chimeras used as template for the homolog-scanning mutagenesis. Their template chimera contained only the EA region, whereas ours contained both the EA and EB regions of the α3(IV) NC1 domain. Because the EA and EBregions are in close proximity in the natively folded α3(IV) NC1 domain, mutants M1–M8 used in our work are likely to reproduce the native GP epitopes more closely. In addition, our study relied on a mutagenesis strategy that allowed (a) a verification of the conformation of the mutants by using three different antibodies that recognize conformational epitopes and (b) a comparison between the binding of GPA and Mab3 antibodies, a priori inferred to bind to different residues in the EA region. The identification of the critical residues of the GPAepitope allows the determination of the structural features that selectively target GPA antibodies to the α3(IV) NC1 domain, among the six homologous NC1 domains of type IV collagen. As revealed by the comparison in Fig. 8 (lower), all four GPA residues (Ala18, Ile19, Val27, and Pro28) occur at the respective position in the α3 sequence only. Intriguingly, three of the GPA residues are hydrophobic in the α3 sequence, but the homologous α1 residues are hydrophilic, charged residues (Asp, Asp, and Lys, respectively). Analysis of data from experimentally determined antigenic sites on proteins has revealed that hydrophobic residues are more likely to be a part of antigenic sites, if they occur on the surface of a protein (25Kolaskar A.S. Tongaonkar P.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar), as GPA residues do in the α3(IV) NC1 monomer. No other chain besides α3(IV) had a constellation of three hydrophobic residues at positions 18, 19, and 27. Moreover, Pro28 occurs only in α3, but not in any of the other five NC1 domains. Therefore, three hydrophobic residues at positions 18, 19, and 27, together with a proline at position 28, in a distinct conformation distinguish α3 among the six NC1 domains, conferring binding of GPA antibodies selectively to the α3(IV) NC1 domain. The EA region of the α3(IV) NC1 domain emerges as a prime candidate for a molecular recognition site that specifies the chain-specific assembly of the α3·α4·α5 network of type IV collagen. Recently, we showed that the NC1 monomers contain recognition sequences for selection of chains and protomers that are sufficient to encode the specificity of assembly of the α1·α2 and α3·α4·α5(IV) networks of the glomerular basement membrane (26Boutaud A. Borza D.-B. Bondar O. Gunwar S. Netzer K.O. Singh N. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30716-30724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), but their identity is unknown. That the EA region is a site of interaction between α3 and the other NC1 domains in the α3·α4·α5 hexamer is deduced from its cryptic nature of the GPA epitope. That the EA region may also be responsible for the specificity of interaction is suggested by the high sequence divergence of this region among the six NC1 domains (27Netzer K.O. Suzuki K. Itoh Y. Hudson B.G. Khalifah R.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The EA region is also distinguished by the highest number of non-conservative amino acid substitutions. Hence, the pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues within the EA region is unique for each of the six NC1 domains and is likely to confer chain-specific conformations and interactions. In particular, the EA region of all six NC1 domains may contribute to the discriminatory interactions that result in specific assembly of chain-specific networks of type IV collagen."

We are studying these complex interactions for the androgen-dependent enhancer of the mouse sex-limited protein (Slp) gene. This enhancer has, in addition to multiple androgen receptor (AR)-binding sites, a central region (FPIV) with a binding site for the ubiquitous transcription factor Oct-1 that appears crucial for hormonal regulation in vivo. To examine the role of Oct-1 in androgen-specific gene activation, we tested the interaction of Oct-1 with AR versus glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in vivo and in vitro. Oct-1 coimmunoprecipitated from cell lysates with both AR and GR, but significant association with AR required both proteins to be DNA-bound. This was confirmed by sensitivity of the protein association to treatment with ethidium bromide or micrococcal nuclease. Addition of DNA to micrococcal nuclease-treated samples restored interaction, even when binding sites were on separate DNA molecules, suggesting association was due to direct protein-protein interaction and not indirect tethering via the DNA. AR/GR chimeras revealed that interaction of the N and C termini of AR was required to communicate the DNA-bound state that enhances interaction with Oct-1. Protease digestion assays of hormone-bound receptors revealed further conformational changes in the ligand binding domain of AR, but not GR, upon DNA binding. Furthermore, these conformational changes led to increased interaction with the coactivator SRC-1, via the NID 4 domain, suggesting DNA binding facilitates recruitment of SRC-1 by the AR-Oct-1 complex. Altogether, these results suggest that the precise arrangement of binding sites in the Slp enhancer ensures proper hormonal response by imposing differential interactions between receptors and Oct-1, which in turn contributes to SRC-1 recruitment to the promoter.

The latter may include interactions with other DNA-binding factors (e.g. AP-1, NFI, and Oct-1) (10Di Croce L. Koop R. Venditti P. Westphal H.M. Nightingale K.P. Corona D.F.V. Becker P.B. Beato M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 45-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or with transcriptional coactivators that do not themselves bind DNA (e.g. SRC-1, GRIP1, and TIF2) (11McKenna N.J. Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These interactions sum to regulate the steroid response in a promoter- and cell context-dependent manner. To understand hormone-specific gene regulation, we study the mouse sex-limited protein (Slp) gene, which expresses in adult male liver and kidney (12Robins D.M. Scheller A. Adler A.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Androgen dependence is mediated by a 120-base pair enhancer located 2 kb upstream of the gene (13Adler A.J. Scheller A., Y. Hoffman Y. Robins D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although both GR and AR are able to bind to HREs within the enhancer in vitro, only androgens elicit a response in vivo. Previous studies have demonstrated that this androgen specificity is determined by the interaction of AR with nonreceptor factors bound adjacent to the HREs (14Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). One critical enhancer region, revealed functionally in transfection assays and biochemically by in vivo and in vitro protein binding studies, is called FPIV (15Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 413-423PubMed Google Scholar, 16Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This complex element includes an Oct-1-like recognition sequence and can bind several other proteins as well as Oct-1 in vitro (17Scarlett C.O. Scheller A. Thompson E. Robins D.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Oct-1 is an intriguing candidate for interaction with AR, in part because of its well established and diverse interactions with GR (18Eraly S.A. Nelson S.B. Huang K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Prefontaine G.G. Walther R. Giffin W. Lemieux M.E. Pope L. Hache R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26713-26719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). That is, Oct-1 can enhance or prevent glucocorticoid induction dependent on the precise sequence and arrangement of the binding sites for these factors. Oct-1 is a ubiquitous member of the POU-homeodomain family and is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of genes (20Verrijzer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that Oct-1 can interact positively or negatively with several nuclear receptors, in a promoter-specific manner. For example, with the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) (21Préfontaine G.G. Lemieux M.E. Giffin W. Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. LaCasse E. Walker P. Hache R.J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3416-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone promoters (22Chandran U. DeFranco D. Behav. Brain Res. 1999; 105: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), binding of both GR and Oct-1 is required for transactivation. In contrast, GR repression of the histone H2b promoter seems to involve sequestration of Oct-1 by GR prior to DNA binding (23Kutoh E. Stromstedt P.-E. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4960-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These studies reveal alternative actions of Oct-1 in nuclear receptor regulation, but the disparate mechanisms responsible are not completely understood. Analysis has been complicated in mammalian cells by pleiotropic effects of altering Oct-1 expression, making functional significance for steroid activation difficult to determine. An alternative approach utilizing expression in yeast cells has not yet overcome the transcriptional inactivity of Oct-1 in that system (24Inamoto S. Segil N. Pan Z.Q. Kimura M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29852-29858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To examine whether Oct-1 is involved in androgen specificity, we compared physical interaction between Oct-1 and AR versusGR. Our data show that both AR and GR interact with Oct-1, but in qualitatively different manners. First, in contrast to GR, AR interacts well with Oct-1 only when both factors are bound to DNA. Second, binding to the Slp enhancer induces selective changes in the conformation of the ligand-binding domain of AR, but not GR, and leads to increased interaction with Oct-1. Finally, the coactivator SRC-1 interacts more efficiently with the AR·Oct-1 complex when both transcription factors are bound to DNA. These results suggest that DNA-dependent protein-protein interactions, functionally amplified by enhanced coactivator recruitment, may promote receptor-selective activation. Thus differential interactions among factors, rather than their stringent specificity, can confer precise hormonal response. cDNAs for the mouse androgen receptor (mAR; D. Tindall) and the rat glucocorticoid receptor (rGR; K. Yamamoto) contained in the eukaryotic expression vector, pCMV5, have been described (16Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Chimeras of AR and GR (AGA, GAG, GAA, and aGAA) have also been described (7Scheller A. Hughes E. Golden K.L. Robins D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24216-24222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For in vitro translation, the mouse AR cDNA was excised from the expression vector and cloned into theHincII site of pGEM4; rat GR cDNA was translated from its original pC7 vector (pC7G). The pGEX3X vectors expressing full-length Oct-1 and Brn-1 as GST-fused proteins were kindly provided by N. Segil (25Segil N. Roberts S.B. Heintz N. Science. 1991; 254: 1814-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and S. Young (26Malik K.F. Jaffe H. Brady J. Young W.S.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), respectively. To translate the AR DBD, the sequence encoding the first 37 amino acids of AR N terminus was fused via a SmaI site to the AR DBD and inserted into pGem4. The chimeric receptors AGA, GAG, GAA, and aGAA were excised from pCMV5 at the KpnI/XbaI site and inserted into the vector pGem3 for in vitro translation. For in vitro translation, the AR dimerization mutant AR/R581D (gift of D. Pearce) (27Chen S. Wang J., Yu, G. Liu W. Pearce D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14087-14092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) was subcloned from pCMV5 into pGem4. SRC-1 was in vitro transcribed/translated from the pCR3.1 vector (gift from B. O'Malley). GST fusion proteins of SRC-1 NIDs were made by digesting the pCR3.1 SRC-1 construct with XcmI/BamHI andAvaI/XbaI. Fragments encoding NID 1–3 (amino acids 568–954; 1.1 kb) and NID 4 (amino acids 1139–1441; 1.2 kb) were subcloned in the GST expression vector pGEX3. Fragments from the Slpenhancer were generated by polymerase chain reaction, using the primer sequences below. The oligo 1 (T) and (B) primers were used to produce a 70-bp DNA fragment containing the octamer-like binding site (FPIV) and HRE-1 and -3 (15Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 413-423PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 C). Oligo 1 (T) and (B) are complementary over 15 bases at their 3′ ends; there is 16 bp between HRE-1 and -3. Primers that introduced linker scanning mutations into oligo 1 (oligos 5–8) have been described previously (3Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In oligo 5 the octamer-like binding site has been disrupted (italicized sequence), whereas in oligo 6 this site has been converted to the Oct-1 consensus sequence. Oligos 7 and 8 were used to mutate HRE-1 and HRE-3, respectively. Oligo 2 and oligo 3 contain the binding sites for Oct-1 or receptor, respectively.

Robins D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30624-30630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The DNA precipitates were left on the cells for 8 h, followed by a glycerol shock with 15% glycerol in 1× HBS buffer (0.3 mNaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 1 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.05). After rinsing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 8% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum containing either 10−7m dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or 10−6m dexamethasone (Dex), as appropriate for 2 days prior to harvesting. Whole cell extracts were prepared from transfected cells as described (29Kupfer S.R. Marschke K.B. Wilson E.M. French F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17519-17527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (supplemented with 10−10m DHT, 10−10m Dex, and protease inhibitors), homogenized by 20 strokes of a B pestle in a Dounce homogenizer, and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min (4 °C). The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay kit) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Quality of extracts was assessed by Western blot analysis for integrity of receptors. For analysis of transfected cells, 5–10 μg of whole cell extracts were resuspended in an equal volume of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on 7.5–8% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry blotter (Buchler Instruments) at room temperature (3 mA/cm2). Nonspecific sites were blocked for 30 min with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 1% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris, pH 7, 5 mm NaCl). Receptors and Oct-1 were revealed using antibodies specific for these proteins (diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk, TBS), and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000, ECL). The anti-AR rabbit polyclonal antiserum used for Western blots was raised against a GST fusion protein including amino acid residues 133–334 of mAR. GR and Oct-1 were detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies (FIGR2 for GR, a generous gift of W. Pratt, and 5G5 for Oct-1, kindly provided by N. Segil). The bands were visualized with the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed essentially as described by Kutoh et al. (23Kutoh E. Stromstedt P.-E. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4960-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min and then incubated with either an anti-AR rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide sequence between base 245 and 263 of mAR, or with anti-GR mouse monoclonal antibody FIGR2, for 1 h at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody complexes were collected by the addition of protein A-Sepharose, and pellets were washed in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer and extracted with 25 μl of SDS sample buffer. The eluted samples were analyzed on 7.5–8% SDS-PAGE gels and subsequently blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were performed with anti-Oct-1 or receptor antibodies as described above. In some experiments the precipitated complexes were treated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) prior to elution (30Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In assays where DNA was added to the reaction, lysates were treated with 4 units of MNase and 2 mm CaCl2 at 25 °C for 5 min (31Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar), followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min (4 °C). The supernatant was collected and 4–8 mm EGTA was added to inhibit the nuclease activity. Before immunoprecipitation, these MNase-treated extracts were incubated in the presence or absence of 30–100 ng of specific DNA or poly(dI/dC), for 15–30 min at 4 °C. GST expression vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells and induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The GST-fused proteins were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography (32Burgos-Trinidad M. Koenig R.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 149: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the relative amount of bound fusion protein was determined by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels. The receptors were translated in vitro using the coupled transcription-translation TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine, using the manufacturer's protocol. Following translation, appropriate hormone was added to each reaction (100 nm DHT for AR, 100 nm Dex for GR). Binding of in vitro translated receptors to isolated GST-fused proteins was performed essentially as described by Préfontaineet al. (21Préfontaine G.G. Lemieux M.E. Giffin W. Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. LaCasse E. Walker P. Hache R.J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3416-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (50 × 103 cpm) of labeled proteins were incubated with 0.5 μg of immobilized GST fusion proteins in 200 μl binding buffer (supplemented with protease inhibitors) for 6–8 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed 5 times with 1 ml of binding buffer. Retained proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed, and analyzed by autoradiography (Autofluor; National Diagnostics). For GST pull downs of both SRC-1 and AR simultaneously, equal amounts of labeled proteins (25 × 103 cpm) were incubated with 0.5 μg of immobilized GST-Oct-1 as described above. Retained proteins were analyzed by autoradiography as before. Limited proteolytic digestion of translated [35S]methionine-labeled receptors (AR and GR) and chimeras (GAA and aGAA) with 20 μg/ml trypsin was carried out essentially as described by Allan et al. (33Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before proteolytic digestion, receptors were hormone-treated (100 nm DHT or Dex, as appropriate, for 10 min at room temperature) and then incubated in the presence or absence of 100 ng of oligo 1 (30 min on ice). 100 ng of nonspecific competitor, poly(dI/dC), was added to control samples. The difference in protease sensitivity among the receptors was quantified using a densitometer and scanning software (NIH Image 1.6) for which the results were plotted as previously described (34Ikeda M. Wilcox E.C. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23096-23104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In vitro binding studies and analysis in transfection of linker scan mutations of the Slp enhancer support a role for Oct-1 in androgen-specific activation (17Scarlett C.O. Scheller A. Thompson E. Robins D.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To confirm this, the ability of AR to associate with Oct-1 in vivo was analyzed by coimmunopreciptitation with receptors expressed in COS-7 cells by transient transfection (Fig.1). AR or GR were precipitated from whole cell lysates with receptor-specific antibodies, and immunoprecipitated complexes were resolved by electrophoresis, and the presence of associated Oct-1 was revealed by Western blot. The specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by immunoblotting the transfected COS-7 cell lysates (Fig. 1 A). In the presence of AR or GR, Oct-1 coprecipitated with receptor antibodies but not with preimmune serum (Fig. 1 B). Interaction of GR with Oct-1 was readily detected in the cell extract but was less evident for AR. Reprobing the Western filters with receptor antisera suggested that the differences in coprecipitated Oct-1 levels were not due to gross differences in levels of receptor expression (Fig. 1 B). Thus, Oct-1 detectably interacts with both receptors in solution but apparently forms a more stable or higher affinity complex with GR than with AR. Since AR and Oct-1 presumably interact functionally when bound to DNA, we asked whether adding their respective binding sites would allow greater complex formation (Fig. 1 C). Coimmunoprecipitation of Oct-1 with AR antibody was enhanced 2–3-fold by including a 70-bp fragment from the Slp enhancer (oligo 1) containing binding sites for Oct-1 (within FPIV) and the receptors (HRE-1 and HRE-3). HRE-3 is a consensus binding site, whereas HRE-1 is a half-site which AR, but not GR, appears to utilize in vivo (16Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The DNA-mediated increase in interaction with Oct-1 was not observed with GR. Enhancement of the Oct-1 signal was not due to increased AR levels in the immune complex (see Fig. 2). This result suggested that binding to DNA enhanced the AR, but not GR, interaction with Oct-1. To distinguish whether binding to DNA promoted direct protein-protein contact or simply tethered both factors via the nucleic acid, coimmunoprecipitations were performed with separate oligonucleotides containing the binding site for Oct-1 (oligo 2) or receptor (oligo 3). AR-Oct-1 interaction was strengthened even when both binding sites were on separate molecules (Fig. 1 C). Oligo 2 alone somewhat enhanced interaction, perhaps due to AR recognition of the partial HRE-1 included in its sequence (5 of 6 half-site bps). However, neither binding site alone increased the association between AR and Oct-1 as dramatically as the two together. Therefore, the DNA-dependent increase in AR-Oct-1 interaction involves protein-protein contacts enhanced when both factors are DNA-bound. To confirm the DNA dependence of AR-Oct-1 association, cell lysates were treated prior to immunoprecipitation with reagents that disrupt DNA-protein interaction, by either distorting DNA structure by intercalation (EtBr) or by degrading nucleic acid (MNase), as described previously (30Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Addition of 50 μg/ml EtBr reduced AR interaction with Oct-1 (Fig. 2) but did not affect Oct-1 interaction with GR (see below). This suggested that the small amount of Oct-1 coprecipitated with AR from lysates without added oligonucleotides (see Fig. 1 B) might be due to residual cellular DNA. To eliminate this DNA, cell lysates were treated with MNase, which was subsequently inactivated with EGTA. Similarly to EtBr, MNase abrogated interaction of Oct-1 with AR but not GR (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the association between AR and Oct-1 in MNase-treated extracts could be restored by the addition of the enhancer DNA, oligo 1. In neither case was the amount of receptor precipitated affected. DNA-dependent AR-Oct-1 interaction was also observed using CV-1 (kidney) and LNCaP (prostate) cell lysates, confirming the generality of the DNA effect. 2M. I. Gonzalez and D. M. Robins, unpublished data. To validate further the DNA-mediated increase in AR-Oct-1 interaction, coimmunoprecipitations were performed with mutant enhancer fragments (Fig. 3). Oligonucleotides 5, 7, and 8 contain mutations that disrupt binding of Oct-1 (oligo 5) or receptors (oligo 7 and 8) to the enhancer. In oligo 6, the octamer-like site within the FPIV region was converted to the consensus Oct-1 sequence. These mutations impair androgen response in transient transfection assays (16Scheller A. Scheinman R.I. Thompson E. Scarlett C.O. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutations that disrupt binding of either Oct-1 (oligo 5) or AR (oligo 7 and 8) to the enhancer only weakly restored interaction between AR and Oct-1 in MNase-treated COS-7 lysates (Fig. 3). However, oligo 6, which increases Oct-1 binding to the enhancer (17Scarlett C.O. Scheller A. Thompson E. Robins D.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), rescued AR-Oct-1 interaction to nearly the same extent as the wild type sequence. Thus, maximal DNA-dependent interaction of AR-Oct-1 requires both AR and Oct-1 to be specifically bound to their cognate elements. To identify the receptor domain(s) involved in the Oct-1 interaction and determine whether this was sufficient to communicate DNA binding, GST pull-down assays were performed with in vitro translated AR fragments (Fig.4). Full-length receptors and fragments containing the LBD were treated following in vitrotranslation with 100 nm of the appropriate hormone. Interaction of full-length AR with GST-Oct-1 was specific since GST alone did not retain the receptors nor did GST-Oct-1 retain luciferase (Fig. 4 A, upper panel). To confirm that the influence of DNA binding could be detected in this approach, the pull-down experiment was performed with full-length AR and GR in the presence and absence of EtBr or MNase (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). Interaction between AR and GST-Oct-1 showed similar sensitivity to EtBr and MNase as in the immunoprecipitation assays, and the interaction could be rescued after MNase treatment by addition of enhancer DNA. Neither MNase nor EtBr (not shown) treatments affected interaction of GR with Oct-1. In this experiment, the source of “contaminating” DNA was apparently AR's own cDNA used as the template for transcription/translation (data not shown). HREs within the coding sequence of AR have been shown to be involved in AR autoregulation (35Dai J.L. Burnstein K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1582-1594PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, DNA binding stabilized the AR-Oct-1 interaction, regardless of the source of the receptor or the influence of diverse cellular proteins. To determine whether DNA dependence in AR-factor interactions was due to an intrinsic instability of AR or to a particular association with POU factors, we compared interaction with Brain-1 (Brn-1), a POU protein expressed in kidney as well as neural tissue (36Schreiber J. Enderich J. Sock E. Schmidt C. Richter-Landsberg C. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32286-32293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

Their concerted action leads to the formation of a large pool of oligopeptides, which can be further utilized byP. gingivalis and other oral bacteria. However, P. gingivalis cannot transport poly- and oligopeptides into the cell, although it has the ability to thrive on dipeptides as a sole source of carbon. For this reason, we have focused our attention on a specialized group of P. gingivalis peptidases capable of hydrolyzing oligopeptides to di- and tripeptides, which can be subsequently metabolized by this periodontopathogen.

In addition, the P. gingivalis genome contains three further putative genes encoding proteinases homologous with dipeptidyl peptidase IV, although their activities have not yet been identified (9Banbula A.

The protease did not show any endopeptidase activity on gelatin, insulin β-chain, carboxymethylated lysozyme, and azocasein or type I collagen (data not shown).

It had an amino-terminal sequence ADKGMMWLLNELNQENLDRMRELGFT. After proteolytic in-gel digestion of the enzyme, additional internal sequences were obtained, including DNKPYK, EMTYL, FAQFAN, VLPAML, SVVPY, and LFFAGL. All of this sequence data allowed us to identify theP. gingivalis genomic contig gln[vert]TIGR[vert]P. gingivalis_ in the Unfinished Microbial Genomes data base, the Institute of Genomic Research. An ORF corresponding to the DPP-7 amino acid sequence was found, as indicated by the fact, that all sequences of the DPP-7-derived peptides obtained by the enzyme polypeptide fragmentation by trypsin were present in the protein primary structure inferred from the nucleotide sequence of the ORF as shown in Fig.4. The entire ORF corresponds to a 675-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated mass of 76247.4 Da. Interestingly, the DPP-7 ORF contains the consensus sequence for the active-site serine residue of serine type proteases, TGGNSGSPVF. As indicated in Fig.5, the DPP-7 carboxyl terminus exhibits a high degree of identity to that of the V8 serine protease, particularly around the putative active site serine residue. This is surprising, since the P. gingivalis DPP-7 is a dipeptidyl peptidase specific for small aliphatic and aromatic residues, whereasStaphylococcus aureus V8 endopeptidase is specific toward substrates containing glutamic and aspartic acid residues in the P1 position. The similarity search performed using the NCBI TBLASTN tool against GenBankTM, EMBL, DDBJ, and PDB data bases showed no significant similarity of DPP-7 to any other known dipeptidyl peptidases, indicating that this enzyme could be regarded as a member of a new family of proteases. Additional searches against data bases containing unfinished and finished microbial genomes allowed us to identify more genes coding for similar proteases with consensus active site sequence TGGNSGSPV (Fig. 6). A gene of related protein has been found in the P. gingivalis W83 unfinished fragment of the complete genome between positions 1,360,759 and 1,362,718. The inferred primary structure of this putative proteinase shows significant similarity to DPP-7 (267/691 identities). Another organism, Shewanella putrefaciens, possesses two related genes (gnl [vert]TIGR_24[vert]sputre 6401 and gnl [vert]TIGR_24[vert]sputre 6410), while a plant pathogen,Xylella fastidiosa, contains one gene coding for similar proteinase (gb[vert]AE004008.1[vert]).Figure 4ORF for the gene coding P. gingivalis DPP-7.

The sequences were subsequently aligned using the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment tool.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition, the computer-assisted search for sequential motifs characteristic for transmembrane domains revealed the presence of two such putative regions within the amino-terminal sequence of DPP-7, with residues 7–24 and 62–78 most likely folded into hydrophobic α-helices responsible for membrane anchoring of this enzyme.DISCUSSIONSeveral studies indicate that the outer membrane of P. gingivalis contains a complex proteolytic machinery, which serves multiple physiological functions. In this study, we have described the identification of a novel proteinase localized on the bacterial surface.The purified enzyme migrated as a single band with a molecular mass of 76 kDa on SDS-PAGE, and its amino-terminal sequence was located within the primary structure of the translated product of the dpp-7gene. Apparently, the enzyme is truncated at the amino terminus due to the action of a lysine-specific proteinase, most likely gingipain K. Taking into account that the N terminus of DPP-7 contains membrane anchorage domains, it is likely that the N-terminal truncation noted here occurred during the isolation procedure and may not represent its true membrane form.The inhibition by typical serine protease inhibitors like diisopropyl fluorophosphate, Pefablock, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as resistance to sulfhydryl group blocking reagents and chelating agents, allowed us to classify this enzyme as a serine protease. However, the P. gingivalis DPP-7 does not belong to any of the six previously described types of dipeptidylpeptidases (20Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998Google Scholar). DPP I is a member of a cysteine class of peptidases and possesses a broad specificity with an exclusion for basic amino acid and proline residues in the P1 site of the scissile peptide bond (21McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DPP VI is another representative of the cysteine proteinase family with dipeptidylpeptidase activity toward the broad spectrum of substrates (22Vacheron M.J. Guinand M. Francon A. Michel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). DPP II, DPP IV, and DPP V belong to the S9 family of the serine proteases (20Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998Google Scholar). Both DPP II and DPP IV share similar specificity directed against Pro and Ala residues in the penultimate position, whereas DPP V is an enzyme secreted by Aspergillus fumigatuswith a unique substrate specificity limited to X-Ala, His-Ser, and Ser-Tyr dipeptides (23Beauvais A. Monod M. Debeaupuis J.P. Diaquin M. Kobayashi H. Latge J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6238-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). DPP III is also classified as a serine peptidase, with its action being restricted to the Arg residue in the P1 position (24Ellis S. Nuenke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4623-4629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In terms of biochemical features, DPP-7 resembles a dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DAP BII), which was isolated from Pseudomonas sp. strain WO24, but the gene sequence of that enzyme remains unknown and does not allow a sequence comparison of these proteins (25Ogasawara W. Kobayashi G. Okada H. Morikawa Y. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6288-6295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because P. gingivalisdipeptidylpeptidase does not exhibit any significant homology to any of the dipeptidyl peptidases described so far, we have named this enzyme DPP-7.Interestingly, the P. gingivalis DPP-7 displays the consensus sequence characteristic for the catalytic site of the V-8 like proteases, a group of endopeptidases cleaving after glutamic or aspartic acid residues (26Carmona C. Gray G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This region of significant sequence similarity is specifically located only at the C-terminal region of both proteases and includes the putative active site serine residue. Interestingly, we identified more genes coding for putative, DPP-7-related proteases in P. gingivalis, X. fastidiosa and S. putrefaciens. Based on the enzymological and gene sequence data presented above, we conclude thatP. gingivalis DPP-7 does not belong to any of the peptidase families previously reported and should, therefore, be regarded as a prototype enzyme that defines a new family of dipeptidylpeptidases. Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral anaerobic bacterium, has been implicated as a causative agent of adult type periodontitis. As an asaccharolytic organism, P. gingivalis is totally dependent on external sources of peptides, which are necessary for its growth and proliferation. To fulfill such a fastidious nutritional requirement, this bacterium evolved a complex system of proteolytic enzymes, which are now recognized as important virulence factors in the development of periodontal disease (1Travis J. Banbula A. Potempa J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 477: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The best known and well characterized enzymes of this system are gingipains R and K, arginine- and lysine-specific cysteine proteinases (2Curtis M.A. Kuramitsu H.K. Lantz M. Macrina F.L. Nakayama K.

https://openalex.org/W2036334255,"The Caenorhabditis elegans unc-87 gene product is essential for the maintenance of the nematode body wall muscle where it is found colocalized with actin in the I band. The molecular domain structure of the protein reveals similarity to the C-terminal repeat region of the smooth muscle actin-binding protein calponin. In this study we investigated thein vitro function of UNC-87 using both the full-length recombinant molecule and several truncated mutants. According to analytical ultracentrifugation UNC-87 occurs as a monomer in solution. UNC-87 cosedimented with both smooth and skeletal muscle F-actin, but not with monomeric G-actin, and exhibited potent actin filament bundling activity. Actin binding was independent of the presence of tropomyosin and the actin cross-linking proteins filamin and α-actinin. Consistent with its actin bundling activity in vitro, UNC-87 tagged with green fluorescent protein associated with and promoted the formation of actin stress fiber bundles in living cells. These data identify UNC-87 as an actin-bundling protein and highlight the calponin-like repeats as a novel actin-binding module. The Caenorhabditis elegans unc-87 gene product is essential for the maintenance of the nematode body wall muscle where it is found colocalized with actin in the I band. The molecular domain structure of the protein reveals similarity to the C-terminal repeat region of the smooth muscle actin-binding protein calponin. In this study we investigated thein vitro function of UNC-87 using both the full-length recombinant molecule and several truncated mutants. According to analytical ultracentrifugation UNC-87 occurs as a monomer in solution. UNC-87 cosedimented with both smooth and skeletal muscle F-actin, but not with monomeric G-actin, and exhibited potent actin filament bundling activity. Actin binding was independent of the presence of tropomyosin and the actin cross-linking proteins filamin and α-actinin. Consistent with its actin bundling activity in vitro, UNC-87 tagged with green fluorescent protein associated with and promoted the formation of actin stress fiber bundles in living cells. These data identify UNC-87 as an actin-bundling protein and highlight the calponin-like repeats as a novel actin-binding module. calponin tropomyosin green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP rat embryo fibroblasts The interaction of actin and myosin to produce force is an essential prerequisite for a variety of cellular processes including muscle contraction (1Huxley H.E. Science. 1969; 164: 1356-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), cell motility, and anchorage (2Wang Y.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The organization of contractile and motile systems based on actin relies on a large family of actin-associated proteins that regulate and define the assembly of actin into filaments and then into filament arrays (3Ayscough K.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,4Volkmann N. Hanein D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To date, more than 60 different proteins directly interacting with actin have been identified, but the majority of F-actin-binding proteins populate partially overlapping regions on the filament (5van Troys M. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 323-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6McGough A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Despite the large number of actin-binding proteins, functional diversity is reflected by a limited number of basic structural modules (7Puius Y.A. Mahoney N.M. Almo S.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Most actin cross-linking proteins exhibit two independent actin-binding domains, each individual actin-binding domain commonly composed of a tandem arrangement of the calponin homology domain module (8Castesana J. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and other modular elements defining the distance between and the relative orientation of the two actin-binding domains, often involving parallel or antiparallel dimerization (7Puius Y.A. Mahoney N.M. Almo S.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that a unique sequence motif found in the C-terminal third of the calponin (CaP)1 molecule and other members of the CaP family of actin-associated proteins (9Stradal T. Kranewitter W. Winder S.J. Gimona M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 134-137Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar), namely a 23-amino acid residue repeat, which we will refer to from now on as the CLIK-23 repeat, forms an independent actin-binding site (10Gimona M. Mital R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1813-1821PubMed Google Scholar). This finding was corroborated by Mino et al. (11Mino, T., Yiasa, U., Nakamura, F., Naka, M. & Tanaka, T. (1998)251, 262–268.Google Scholar) who demonstrated the direct interaction of a peptide corresponding to the first CaP repeat with actin in vitro. A survey of the available data bases identified other proteins with CLIK-23 repeats, in particular the Caenorhabditis elegans body wall muscle protein UNC-87 that exhibits seven tandem CLIK-23 repeats (12Goetinck S. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A protein with a similar molecular structure has also been described by Irvine et al. (13Irvine M. Huima T. Prince A.M. Lustigman S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus. Although the UNC-87 protein was identified as a key molecule for maintenance of the structural integrity of the myoskeletal apparatus in the nematode (12Goetinck S. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Goetinck S. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), no further information on its putative biological function or on the mode of interaction with actin was obtained. In this study we show that UNC-87 is an actin-bundling protein in vitro and in vivo and present evidence for a binding site of the CLIK motif on the actin filament different from that of other actin cross-linking proteins. The expression plasmids UNC-87-pEGFP-C1 (for expression of a GFP-tagged full-length UNC-87 protein in mammalian cells) and UNC-87-pMW172 (for bacterial expression of untagged full-length UNC-87) were constructed from theunc-87 full-length cDNA clone pSG3 (accession numberU04711; see Ref. 14Goetinck S. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This cDNA corresponds to the predominantly transcribed smaller splice variant (UNC-87b) and contains exons A, C, D, E, F, and G (14Goetinck S. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction on pSG3 was performed using a forward primer that starts amplification at the first of two potential start sites and introduces a BglII site immediately 5′ to the start codon. The reverse primer introduces anEcoRI site immediately 3′ of the original unc-87 stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withBglII and EcoRI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pEGFP-C1 and the BamHI and EcoRI site of pMW172 (15Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), respectively. All sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using a LI-Cor model 400 automated sequencer (MWG Biotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany). The deletion mutants containing repeats 2–7 (amino acids 69–374), 3–7 (), 4–7 (), and 5–7 () were made by polymerase chain reaction essentially the same way as described for the full-length constructs and cloned into pEGCP-C1 and pMW172, respectively. For construction of the deletion mutant containing repeats 1–3 (amino acids 1–169) full-length UNC-87-pEGFP-C1 was digested withAcyI followed by a complete fill-in of the overhang by Klenow fragment. After digestion with BglII the UNC-87 fragment was cloned into the BglII and SmaI site of pEGFP-C1. For bacterial expression this construct was again digested with BglII and BclI and ligated into theBamHI site of pMW172. The correct orientation was confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid UNC-87-pMW172 and the UNC-87 deletion mutants in pMW172, respectively, were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 DE3. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were scraped off the plate and suspended in 500 ml of LB with ampicillin. The cultures were grown to anA600 = 0.6–0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. 3–4 h after induction the culture was centrifuged at 1250 ×g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in Buffer E (5 mm KH2PO4, 5 mmK2HPO4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). The bacteria were lysed in a French® pressure cell press (Spectronic Unicam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied immediately onto a 5-ml HiTrap SP cation exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in Buffer E. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient, ranging from 0–350 mm NaCl in Buffer E. Peak fractions were pooled and further purified on a Sephacryl S100HR (500 ml) equilibrated in Buffer E. Fractions containing >96%pure UNC-87 were concentrated on a 1-ml HiTrap SP and eluted again with a gradient of 0–350 mmNaCl. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin or turkey gizzard smooth muscle actin was prepared from acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (16Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Strzelecka-Golaszewska et al.(17Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Kakubiak M. Drabikowski W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 55: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), respectively. Recombinant h1 and h2 CaP were expressed and purified as described (10Gimona M. Mital R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1813-1821PubMed Google Scholar). Tropomyosin and α-actinin were purified from turkey gizzard smooth muscle as described (18Gimona M. Herzog M. Vandekerckhove J. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19Gimona M. Fürst D.O. Small J.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1987; 8: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mouse melanoma cells (B16F1) or rat embryo fibroblasts (REF 52) grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10%fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria) to 75%confluency were transfected for 24 h using 2 μg of total DNA per construct per 60-mm dish using 8.5 μl of Superfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and prepared for immunofluorescence as described elsewhere (10Gimona M. Mital R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1813-1821PubMed Google Scholar). GFP-tagged UNC-87 was visualized by direct fluorescence using the excitation wavelength of fluorescein. F-actin was visualized by incubation with Alexa 568 Phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Fluorescent images were photographed on a Zeiss Axiophot using a × 63 oil immersion lens and Eastman Kodak Co. P400 Tmax film. Immunoprecipitations using a polyclonal antibody to recombinant EGFP were performed essentially as described earlier (20Gimona M. Watakabe A. Helfman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9776-9780Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with minor modifications in the IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 300 mm KCL, 5%(v/v) glycerol, 0.5%(v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). Proteins were visualized by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies to EGFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and β-actin (Sigma), respectively. Cosedimentation assays with smooth or skeletal muscle F-actin were performed in F-actin buffer (20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 100 KCl) or G-actin buffer (20 mmimidazole, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 50 mm NaCl). Proteins were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and pelleted either at 100,000 × gfor 30 min (high speed) using an air-driven ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) or at 20,000 × g for 20 min (low speed) using an Eppendorf model 5417 R centrifuge (Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz GmbH, Vienna, Austria). Pellets were resuspended in the same buffer in the starting volume. Analytical SDS gel electrophoresis on 8–22%gradient polyacrylamide mini-slab gels and Western blotting onto nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed as described (18Gimona M. Herzog M. Vandekerckhove J. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Transferred proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For detection of GFP fusion proteins we used a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Transfected cells in 60-mm Petri dishes were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently extracted in 250 μl of IP buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1%Triton X-100) supplemented with 200, 400, 600, or 800 mm KCl for 10 min. Extracts were collected with a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Extracts and Triton X-100-insoluble pellets were brought to equal volumes and prepared for SDS gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described above. Sedimentation velocity profiles of purified proteins (1 mg/ml in 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmKH2PO4, 5 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.0) were collected in an analytical ultracentrifuge (Optima XL-A, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 60,000 rpm at 20 °C. The data were analyzed using the program Ultrascan 4.1 (The University of Texas Health Center at San Antonio; see Ref. 21Hansen J.C. Lebowitz J. Demeler B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13155-13163Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) by using the van Holde-Weischet method (22van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The domain structure of UNC-87 is similar to that of the C-terminal third of the CaP molecule (Fig. 1 A). The UNC-87 sequence comprises 7 copies of a highly basic repeat of 23–26 amino acid residues, tentatively termed 23-residuecalponin-like repeat or CLIK-23 repeat, interspersed by highly acidic “intervening” or linker sequences. Whereas the repeats in UNC-87 show a striking sequence similarity to those present in CaP, the intervening regions are unique in sequence and variable in length but similar to the CaP intervening sequences in their calculated isoelectric points. We have cloned the coding region of the major 41-kDa UNC-87 isoform (UNC-87b) and the truncation mutants depicted in Fig. 1 Binto the prokaryotic expression vector pMW172 for the expression of recombinant, nonfusion proteins. The proteins were purified under native conditions from the bacterial cytosol by alternating ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). We routinely obtained between 15 and 25 mg of purified UNC-87 protein from a 1-liter bacterial culture in less than 48 h. The final protein was more than 96%pure (Fig. 1 C) and was stable in solution at 4 °C for more than 4 weeks. High-speed cosedimentation assays using purified smooth (Fig.2 A-C) or skeletal (not shown) muscle F-actin showed that full-length UNC-87 bound tenaciously to actin with a saturation of binding of UNC-87 to actin at a molar ratio of 1:6–1:4 (Fig. 2 A). No UNC-87 was pelletted in the absence of F-actin at 100,000 × g. Addition of smooth muscle TM to UNC-87-saturated F-actin filaments had no influence on the binding of UNC-87 to actin, and binding of TM was likewise unaffected in the reverse experiment using TM-saturated smooth muscle actin filaments (Fig. 2, B and C). It has been reported that CaP at high concentrations can induce bundles of smooth muscle F-actin (23Kolakowski J. Makuch R. Stepkowski D. Dabrowska R. Biochem., J. 1995; 306: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When smooth or skeletal muscle F-actin were incubated together with UNC-87 and centrifuged for 20 min at 18,000 × g, actin and UNC-87 were found together in the low speed pellet, indicating the induction of actin bundles by UNC-87 (Fig. 2 D). This cross-linking effect was concentration-dependent and ceased abruptly when the molar ratio of actin:UNC-87 dropped below 6:1 (Fig. 2 D). Thus, UNC-87 functions as an actin cross-linking protein in vitro. To define the structure of the cross-linked actin assemblies in more detail we analyzed them by electron microscopy. As seen in Fig.3, A and B, UNC-87 caused the formation of dense, parallel actin bundles. The tight packing of the individual filaments increased the stiffness of the bundles, resulting in abrupt fractures (Fig. 3 C). Identical results were obtained with smooth muscle actin (not shown). Because CaP has been shown to induce actin polymerization at low ionic strength (24Kake T. Kimura S. Takahashi K. Maruyama K. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) we tested whether UNC-87 shared this ability. As seen in Fig. 4, the UNC-87 protein failed to induce the polymerization of G-actin as judged from both low speed (Fig. 4 C) or high speed (not shown) sedimentation. In contrast, h1 CaP efficiently cosedimented with actin at low speed under both F-actin (Fig. 4 A) and G-actin conditions (Fig. 4 B), indicating the induction of actin polymerization and bundling of the formed filaments. Binding of UNC-87 with actin was unaffected by the presence of the actin-binding proteins α-actinin (Fig. 5) and filamin (not shown) indicating that α-actinin and UNC-87 occupy different sites on the actin filament.Figure 5UNC-87 and α-actinin bind simultaneously to F-actin. Low speed cosedimentation assay under the same conditions as in Fig. 2 using decreasing amounts of α-actinin and UNC-87, respectively, is shown. Note that the actin filaments can be simultaneously saturated with both proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A prerequisite for the cross-linking activity of actin-binding proteins is the presence of two independent actin-binding sites, either on the single protein subunit or as a result of a dimerization or oligomerization process. Secondary structure predictions failed to identify two potential regions capable of forming actin-binding sites in the UNC-87 molecule. To investigate whether the UNC-87 molecule may form dimers in solution we used analytical ultracentrifugation under native conditions. The van Holde-Weischet extrapolation (22van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) from the sedimentation velocity data showed that the full-length UNC-87 is monodisperse in solution and has a sedimentation coefficient of 2.0 S (Fig.6). The deletion mutants of UNC-87 containing the CLIK-23 modules 1–3, 3–7, or 5–7, respectively, all had sedimentation coefficients ≤ 1.6 S (not shown). Thus, the multiple CLIK-23 modules may serve to form at least two independent actin binding interfaces. The cosedimentation data demonstrated that UNC-87 is capable of bundling actin in vitro. For studies of the bundling activity in living cells we cloned the UNC-87 cDNA into the pEGFP C1 vector to generate a mutant protein fused to GFP at its amino terminus. Various cell lines were transfected with this construct, and the cellular localization was determined by fluorescence microscopy. In REF 52 fibroblasts UNC-87 localized to the actin stress fibers, and the ectopic expression of the UNC-87 protein caused a significant increase in stress fiber bundling (Fig.7, A and B). Moreover, stress fiber formation was significantly enhanced in the mouse melanoma cell line B16F1 (Fig. 7, C and D), consistent with the strong bundling effects observed in our in vitro experiments. To assay for the strength of association with the actin cytoskeletonin vivo we analyzed the extractability of the UNC-87 protein. The amount of soluble protein was analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to GFP. For comparison, we used extracts of cells transfected with GFP-tagged α-actinin, extracted in the same way. As demonstrated in Fig. 8, UNC-87 was strongly retained in the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction even at 800 mm KCl, an ionic strength at which α-actinin was readily solubilized. To further delineate the region(s) involved in the interaction with the actin filament we performed high and low speed cosedimentation assays as above but using the truncated, purified proteins shown in Fig. 1 C. As summarized in TableI, deletion of more than the first three repeats (mutant 4–7) completely abolished both binding and bundling activities in vitro, whereas a mutant comprising the first three repeats (mutant 1–3) retained a weak actin association and actin bundling activity. A similar effect was observed in REF 52 cells transiently transfected with the mutant UNC-87 constructs fused to GFP at their amino terminus (Fig. 9). The progressive deletion of repeat sequences was mirrored by a reduction in stress fiber localization. Weak stress fiber localization was still observed for the amino-terminal mutant 1–3.Table ISummary of activities from high speed (binding) and low speed (bundling) actin cosedimentation assays using the indicated UNC-87 deletion mutants. The data are representative of at least four independent experiments. Note the concomitant loss of binding and bundling for the mutant constructs 4–7 and 5–7, whereas the amino terminal mutant 1–3 retains weak binding activity.ConstructActin bindingActin bundlingFull-length++++++2–7++++3–7+++4–7−−5–7−−1–3+/−+/− Open table in a new tab Finally, we confirmed the loss of binding and bundling activity for the respective UNC-87 mutants by coimmunoprecipitation from cell lysates of transiently transfected REF 52 cells using a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 10). Only those constructs displaying bundling activity in vitro (compare with Table I) coprecipitated actin in this assay. Our findings identify the UNC-87 protein as an actin-bundling molecule, which uses seven copies of an archetypal protein module (the CLIK-23 repeat) to bind to and cross-link F-actin. The overall molecular structure of UNC-87 is similar to that of the C-terminal third of CaP, featuring alternating basic and acidic amino acid stretches (Fig. 1 A). The CaP family of actin-binding proteins exhibiting CLIK-23 repeat motifs likely evolved from an ancestral molecule by gene duplication and subsequent diversification. Three copies of the CLIK-23 repeat are found in all calponins flanking the strong actin-binding site and the myosin ATPase inhibitory region responsible for the inhibition of the actin-activated myosin ATPase activity (25Takahashi K. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13284-13288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26El-Mezgueldi M. Strasser P. Fattoum A. Gimona M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3654-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the CLIK-23 repeats, which constitute the second autonomous actin-binding site (ABS2) in CaP, may serve to attach this molecule to a second site on the filament not directly involved in the regulation of actomyosin interactions. The sharp breaks seen in the filament bundles suggest that UNC-87 confers rigidity to the actin filaments. A similar observation has been reported earlier for the actin cross-linking protein fimbrin (27Bretscher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1981; 78: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, UNC-87 may act as a structural component of the nematode muscle by cross-linking actin filaments into stable bundles. This hypothesis is consistent with the previous observations that UNC-87 knock-out animals display distorted myofilaments (12Goetinck S. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Goetinck S. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A structural role has also been postulated for CaP (10Gimona M. Mital R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1813-1821PubMed Google Scholar, 28Leinweber B. Tang J.X. Stafford III, W.F. Chalovich J.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3208-3217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which bundles filaments at low ionic strength (29Tang J.X. Szymanki P.T. Janmey P.A. Tao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 432-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that the cytoskeleton-stabilizing function of CaP is contributed by the C-terminal repeats. In their original work, Goetinck and Waterston (12Goetinck S. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) mapped UNC-87 to the myofilament system of the invertebrate body wall muscle, and immunocytochemical analyses pointed toward an association with the actin-containing thin filaments. Here we have demonstrated that UNC-87 binds directly to F-actin in vitro and that the protein possesses potent bundling activity both in vitro and in living cells. This result is concordant with the documented importance of the molecule for the maintenance of muscle integrity. The localization of UNC-87 in C. elegans was unaffected in the TM null-mutants, suggesting that the two proteins are capable of coassociating with the thin filament (12Goetinck S. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which we now confirmed byin vitro analyses. UNC-87 binding to actin was also unaffected by saturating concentrations of either α-actinin or filamin, indicating the occupation of nonoverlapping sites on the actin filament. In support of this Chalovich and colleagues (28Leinweber B. Tang J.X. Stafford III, W.F. Chalovich J.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3208-3217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported that α-actinin, filamin, and calponin show only little displacement and are capable of binding the actin filament simultaneously in almost stoichiometrical amounts. Thus, the second actin-binding site of CaP (ABS2) and that of UNC-87 are likely to interact with a similar region along the filament. Studies specifically addressing the question of how and where UNC-87 and CaP bind to actin using three-dimensional helical image reconstructions of cryoelectron micrographs are currently underway. Our deletion studies demonstrate that the individual repeats contribute differently to the overall actin binding activity of UNC-87. Whereas the three N-terminal repeats still show detectable binding activityin vitro and in transfected cells, the C-terminal four repeats are not sufficient for actin binding. Thus, despite the sequence similarity of the CLIK-23 modules, the acidic intervening sequences may also be relevant for the overall structural integrity of the molecule and in particular the actin binding interface(s). Notably, all CLIK-23 modules identified thus far are interspersed by these acidic linker regions and are found exclusively in odd numbers of copies (1, 3, 5, or 7). Detailed structural analyses of the UNC-87 molecule will shed more light on this question in the future. The exclusive localization of GFP-UNC-87 (and also that of Myc-tagged UNC-87; data not shown) along actin stress fibers is similar to the subcellular localization seen with HA- or GFP-tagged smooth muscle CaP and the C-terminally truncated versions of all three CaP isoforms (30Danninger C. Gimona M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3725-3736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GFP-tagged UNC-87 caused the condensation of actin stress fibers into thick bundles in transfected cultured REF 52 cells and induced the formation of prominent stress fibers in the mouse melanoma cell line B16F1. Together with our data from the in vitro binding assays and the coimmunoprecipitations this illustrates that UNC-87, like CaP, is capable of interacting with both muscle- and nonmuscle-type vertebrate actins. The interaction of UNC-87 with filamentous actin was essentially insensitive to ionic strength. Actin cosedimentation under both low and high speed conditions was unchanged at salt concentrations ranging from 50–300 mm KCl (data not shown). More significantly, the majority of the UNC-87 protein remained associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction even at 800 mm KCl, whereas α-actinin was readily extracted from the cells under these conditions. Thus, electrostatic interactions may play a subordinate role in the binding of UNC-87 to actin. Taken together, the binding and extraction data point toward a high affinity interaction of UNC-87 with actin. We conclude that the basic CLIK-23 repeats and not the acidic intervening sequences are responsible for contacting the actin filament. First, the intervening sequences of CaP and UNC-87 share no apparent similarities other than the predicted acidic pI (see also Fig.1 A), but the isolated repeat region of CaP colocalized with actin stress fibers in transfected cells (10Gimona M.

(11Mino, T., Yiasa, U., Nakamura, F., Naka, M. & Tanaka, T. (1998)251, 262–268.Google Scholar) have shown the direct interaction of a peptide corresponding to the first repeat of CaP with actin. Emerging structural information suggests that nature operates with a limited number of actin binding motifs (31Pollard T.D. Almo S. Quirk S. Vinson V. Lattman E.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 207-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The CLIK-23 repeats share no apparent similarity with any of the currently known actin binding sequences. An actin-binding protein containing six copies of the Kelch motif and consisting predominantly of β-sheet structures is found in the Limulus sperm protein scruin (5van Troys M. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 323-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which also bundles actin in vitro (32Sanders M.C. Way M. Sakai J. Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2651-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Computer-assisted secondary structure analysis (data not shown) of UNC-87 or the corresponding repeat region in CaP predict for both sequences a high content (70%) of unstructured turns with only 17%helical and 13%β-sheet folds, clearly different from scruin. Thus, the actin-binding site(s) formed by the multiple CLIK-23 repeats in CaP and UNC-87 appears to constitute a novel structural actin binding motif, which awaits further analysis. The UNC-87 protein appears as a monomer in solution according to the data from the analytical ultracentrifugation. Similarly, the deletion mutants 3–7, 5–7, and 1–3 also sedimented at values indicating a monomeric molecule corresponding to the calculated molecular mass. Chemical cross-linking, using the zero length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethyl amino) propyl] carbodiimide (EDC), but also [Bis sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate] (BS3) orm-Meleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), confirmed these results (data not shown). Thus, UNC-87 is likely to function as a monomer in vivo. Because cross-linking activities depend on the presence of at least two binding interfaces these results indicate that the seven CLIK 23 repeats form a minimum of two actin-binding sites. The fact that the binding and bundling capabilities were lost simultaneously in the deletion mutants argues for a structural requirement that involves both N- and C-terminal repeat regions. Notably, under the same buffer conditions used for the cross-linking and sedimentation assays both full-length UNC-87 and the deletion mutants migrated significantly faster on analytical gel filtration columns, and the proteins eluted at positions corresponding to 1.5–2.3 times the calculated molecular mass, indicating that the UNC-87 molecule may form an extended, rigid rod structure. 3W. Kranewitter, G. Lepperdinger, and M. Gimona, unpublished data. The expression of CaP isoforms is not restricted to muscle tissue, and different members of the CaP family have been identified in a wide range of vertebrate cells. CaP variants have thus been implicated in the regulation of a variety of actomyosin-based processes, including neurite outgrowth (33Ferhat L. Charton G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. der Terossian E. Khrestchatski M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the organization of the nonmuscle cell cytoskeleton (34Fukui Y. Masuda H. Takagi M. Takahashi K. Kiyokane K. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1997; 14: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The CLIK-23 module may have acquired a specialized function in the course of evolution from invertebrates to vertebrates and the concomitant specialization of different muscle types (see also Ref. 35Martin R.M. Chilton N.B. Lightowlers M.W. Gasser R.B. Int. J. Parasitol. 1997; 27: 1561-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is, however, worth noting that the C. elegansgenome contains proteins closely related to the SM22-like members of the CaP family (consisting of a single copy of both a CLIK-23 repeat and a single N-terminal calponin homology domain) but also Vav and IQGAP-like proteins harboring a single calponin homology domain (8Castesana J. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Stradal T. Kranewitter W. Winder S.J. Gimona M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 134-137Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and no CLIK-23 module. Thus, UNC-87 may be a CaP ortholog specialized for actin filament assembly processes in invertebrate obliquely striated muscle. In summary, we have demonstrated that UNC-87 interacts directly with F-, but not G-actin, and causes the formation of rigid actin bundles. We suggest a physiological role for this protein as a “rectifying” component of the actomyosin system in nematodes and propose a similar structural role, performed by the three homologous CLIK-23 repeats in the smooth muscle protein calponin in vertebrate muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2065098894,"In certain maize genotypes (nulls), β-glucosidase does not enter the gel and therefore cannot be detected on zymograms. Such genotypes were initially thought to be homozygous for a null allele at the glu1 gene. We have shown that a β-glucosidase aggregating factor (BGAF) is responsible for the null phenotype, and it specifically interacts with maize β-glucosidases and forms large insoluble aggregates. To understand the mechanism of the β-glucosidase-BGAF interaction, we constructed chimeric enzymes by domain swapping between the maize β-glucosidase isozymes Glu1 and Gu2, to which BGAF binds, and the sorghum β-glucosidase (dhurrinase) isozyme Dhr1, to which BGAF does not bind. The results of binding assays with 12 different chimeric enzymes showed that an N-terminal region (Glu50-Val145) and an extreme C-terminal region (Phe466-Ala512) together form the BGAF binding site on the enzyme surface. In addition, we purified BGAF, determined its N-terminal sequence, amplified the BGAF cDNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, expressed it inEscherichia coli, and showed that it encodes a protein whose binding and immunological properties are identical to the native BGAF isolated from maize tissues. A data base search revealed that BGAF is a member of the jasmonite-induced protein family. Interestingly, the deduced BGAF sequence contained an octapeptide sequence (G(P/R)WGGSGG) repeated twice. Each of these repeat units is postulated to be involved in forming a site for binding to maize β-glucosidases and thus provides a plausible explanation for the divalent function of BGAF predicted from binding assays.

The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of aryl and alkyl β-d-glucosides as well as glucosides with a carbohydrate moiety such as β-linked oligosaccharides (1Reese E.T. Recent Adv. Phytochem. 1977; 11: 311-368Google Scholar). The occurrence and activity of β-glucosidase in maize is correlated with growth and certain desirable traits (2Kahler A.L. Wehrhahn C.F. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1986; 72: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The major function of maize β-glucosidase, however, may be in the defense of young plant parts against pathogens and herbivores by releasing toxic aglycones (e.g. hydroxamic acids) from their glucosides. Hydroxamic acids, derivatives of 1,4-benzoxazin-3-one, are believed to be the major defense compounds in maize, wheat, rye, and wild barley (3Niemeyer H.M. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 3349-3358Crossref Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The predominant hydroxamic acid glucoside in maize is 2-glucopyranosyl 4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOAGlc), whose aglycone DIMBOA is the primary defense chemical against aphids and the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis). Several studies have shown a high correlation between DIMBOA content of maize genotypes and the level of resistance to or inhibitory affect on insects and pathogens (4Massardo F. Zuniga G.E. Perez L.M. Corcuera L.J. Phytochemistry. 1994; 35: 873-876Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Niemeyer H.M. Peters D.C. Webster J.D. Chlouber C.J.

Arnason J.T. Philogene B.J.R. Can. J. Bot. 1991; 69: 677-681Crossref Google Scholar). In certain maize genotypes (nulls), β-glucosidase occurs as part of large insoluble quaternary aggregates (9Esen A. Cokmus C. Biochem. Genet. 1990; 28: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The β-glucosidase zymograms of such genotypes are devoid of enzyme bands (10Stuber C.W. Goodman M.M. Johnson F.M. Biochem. Genet. 1977; 15: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These genotypes were initially thought to be homozygous for a null allele at the glu1 gene. However, biochemical and immunological data from our laboratory established that the so-called null genotypes have β-glucosidase activity when assayed in solution, and have a 60-kDa polypeptide reacting specifically with anti-β-glucosidase sera on immunoblots (9Esen A. Cokmus C. Biochem. Genet. 1990; 28: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The enzyme is not detected on zymograms, because it occurs as large quaternary structures (>1.5 × 106Da), which fail to enter the gel. After dissociation of these structures by SDS, the enzyme can be detected on gels (11Esen A. Blanchard D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the null phenotype is due to a β-glucosidase aggregating factor (BGAF),1which specifically interacts with the enzyme, forming high molecular weight heterocomplexes (11Esen A. Blanchard D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have identified BGAF as a protein belonging to the jasmonic acid-induced protein (JAp) family, and BGAF is solely responsible for β-glucosidase aggregation and insolubility, and thus, the apparent null phenotype. Jasmonic acid and salicylic acid are plant-signaling molecules that play an important role in induced disease resistance pathways. JAps are believed to function in some step of these pathways. Blocking the response to either of these signals can render plants more susceptible to pathogens (12Gaffney T. Friedrich L. Vernooij B. Negrotto D. Nye G. Uknes S. Ward E. Kessmann H. Ryals J.

A. 1997; 94: 5473-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the jasmonic acid-dependent induced systemic resistance pathway and the salicylic acid-dependent systemic acquired resistance pathway are fully compatible, and they result in an additive effect on the level of induced protection (19Van Wees S.C.M. de Swart E.A.M. van Pelt J.A. van Loon L.C. Pieterse C.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8711-8716Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In maize, cDNAs corresponding to the β-glucosidase genes (glu1 and glu2) have been cloned and sequenced (Refs. 20Brzobohaty B. Moore I. Christofferson P. Bako L. Campos N. Schell J. Palme K. Science. 1993; 262: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 21Bandaranayake H. Esen A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1048Google Scholar; A. Esen and M. Shahid, direct submission GenBank™ accession number U25157). The putative protein products of these cDNAs, Glu1 and Glu2, show 90% sequence identity with each other. Additionally, a β-glucosidase cDNA (dhr1) from sorghum has been sequenced, which shares 70% sequence identity with Glu1 and Glu2 (22Cicek M. Esen A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1469-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Despite their high sequence identity, the maize and sorghum enzymes are functionally different with respect to BGAF binding. BGAF binds to both maize isozymes (Glu1 and Glu2) with high specificity but does not bind to their sorghum homolog Dhr1. Therefore, they provide an excellent system to study functional differences at nonconserved residues and elucidate the mechanism of BGAF-mediated enzyme aggregation and insolubility. The objective of the present study is to elucidate the mechanism of the β-glucosidase-BGAF interaction. To this end, we have generated a series of chimeras among Glu1, Glu2, and Dhr1 by domain swapping to identify the sites involved in BGAF binding. The binding properties of these chimeras enabled us to identify two separate and distinct polypeptide segments that together form a BGAF binding site on the surface of maize β-glucosidases. Finally, we have cloned and sequenced the BGAF cDNA and confirmed its identification by expressing it in Escherichia coli and demonstrating the activity of its recombinant protein product unequivocally in binding assays. The cloning and expression of cDNAs encoding Glu1, Glu2, and Dhr1 in E. coli were as described by Cicek and Esen (23Cicek M. Esen A. Biotech. Bioeng. 1999; 63: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the mature sorghum β-glucosidase (dhurrinase-1) protein was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the same procedure and primers (sense, 5′-GCCACGAGCTAGCACGATAAGCAGTGAG-3′ and antisense, 5′-AGCAGCTCGAGTTCTACTTAATTAGTTAAGC-3′) containingNheI (5′-end) and XhoI (3′-end) restriction enzyme sites (underlined), respectively. The construction and the expression of chimeric cDNAs were done using the wild-type parental plasmids as templates (i.e. glu1, glu2, and dhr1 above). The peptide sequences from which the oligonucleotides were derived for chimeric cDNA construction by PCR are underlined in Fig.1 A (see below). Chimeric cDNAs (proteins shown in Fig.1 B) were constructed by the PCR-based technique of overlap extension (24Horton R. Cai M.Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The internal oligonucleotides used to assemble chimeric β-glucosidases were: C-2, (sense) 5′-GGCTACTTCGCGTGGTCTCT-3′ and (antisense) 5′AGAGACCACGCGAAGTAGCC-3′; C-4, sense same as C-2 sense, and C-4 antisense same as C-2 antisense; C-15, (sense) 5′-GCCAAGTGGTTGAGGAGTTCAA-3′ and (antisense) 5′-TTGAACTCCTGCAACCACTTGGC-3′; C-16, (sense) 5′-GCCAGGTGGTTGAAAGAGTTCAA-3′ and (antisense) 5′-TTGAACTCTTTCAACCACCTGGC-3′; C-21, (sense) 5′-GGCATYGTCTACGTCGAYCGC-3′ and (antisense) 5′-GCRRTCGACGTAGACRATGCC-3′ (chimera 16 was the template in PCR); C-22, (sense) 5′-GGCATYGTCTACGTCGAYCGC-3′ (chimera 16 was the template in PCR) and (antisense) 5′-GCRRTCGACGTAGACRATGCC-3′; C-19, (sense) 5′-TGCCCCRGGRCGRTGCTCACCKGG-3′ and (antisense) 5′-CCMGGTGAGCAYCGYCCYGGGGCA-3′; C-18, (sense) 5′-GGCTACTTCGCGTGGTCTCT-3′ and (antisense) 5′-AGAGACCACGCGAAGTAGCC-3′; C-5, (sense) 5′-TGCCGCCACTTCAGCGTACCA-3′ and (antisense) 5′-TGGTACGCTGAAGTGGCGGCAC-3′; C-6, (sense) same as C-5 sense, and antisense same as C-5 antisense; C-26, (sense) 5′-TATGTAACAATTTTCCACTGGGA-3′ and (antisense) 5′-TCCCAGTGGAAAATTGTTACATA-3′. All wild-type and chimeric enzymes were expressed without tags to eliminate the possibility of undesirable affects on protein structure, activity, and stability. Protein production in E. coli pLys S cultures containing each of the recombinant plasmid constructs and protein extraction from cultures after induction were performed as described previously (23Cicek M. Esen A. Biotech. Bioeng. 1999; 63: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Cicek M. Blanchard D.J. Bevan D.R. Esen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20002-20011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The wild-type β-glucosidases and their chimeras (C-2, C-4, C-15, C-16, C-21, and C-22) were isolated from lysates of 800-ml cultures grown at 37 °C and induced at 25 °C. The enzymes were purified to near homogeneity using a combination of differential solubility fractionation by ammonium sulfate (AS) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography as described previously (25Cicek M. Blanchard D.J. Bevan D.R. Esen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20002-20011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Etiolated seedlings of 3-day-old maize inbred line H95 (null) was used as the source for purification of BGAF. BGAF was isolated in its free form from the pellet fraction of shoot homogenates that had been extracted four times with 50 mmNaAc (pH 5.0) buffer containing 30% AS (these conditions keep BGAF insoluble but removes β-glucosidase). The fourth pellet containing predominantly free BGAF was extracted with 50 mm NaAc buffer (pH 5.0). The extract was subjected to gel filtration on Sephacryl HR-200 (90 × 1.6 cm), and the fractions containing BGAF were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and pooled. Ammonium sulfate was added to the pooled fractions to a final concentration of 0.8 m and applied to a ToyoPearl-butyl 650m hydrophobic interaction chromatography column equilibrated with 50 mm NaAc (pH 5.0) containing 0.8m AS. The column was developed with a manual step gradient using 0.1 m increments from 0.8 to 0.1 m AS. BGAF-containing fractions were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, pooled, and concentrated on a 10,000 cut-off spin column (Gelman Sciences). The purity of BGAF was checked by SDS-PAGE, and ∼250 pmol of BGAF were subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The interaction between BGAF and β-glucosidase was measured in a binding assay by mixing purified BGAF at 10-fold molar excess with purified β-glucosidases or their chimeras. In the case of chimeras C-5, C-6, C-18, C-19, and C-26, crude expression extracts rather than purified enzymes were used as β-glucosidase source in binding assays. The BGAF-β-glucosidase interaction is very specific and reminiscent of antigen-antibody interactions, therefore, crude expression extracts rather than purified enzyme could be used as ligand source. The enzyme-BGAF mixes were incubated on ice for 1–2 h with occasional mixing. The reaction mixes were then electrophoresed on 8% native gels, and the gels were equilibrated with two changes of 50 mm citrate/100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.8) for 5 min each after electrophoresis. β-Glucosidase activity was detected by incubating the equilibrated gels in a 1 mm solution of the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucoside (MUGlc) for 5–10 min. β-Glucosidase activity zones (bands) were visualized under UV light and documented using an AlphaImager 2000 documentation and analysis system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) (Fig.2). The BGAF-Dhr1 binding assay was essentially the same as described above, except that mobility shifts of BGAF were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-BGAF serum as probe instead of enzymatic activity, because Dhr1 does not hydrolyze MUGlc. Initially, purified BGAF was incubated in 2-fold incremental concentrations ranging from 20 to 2.5 μg/ml with a fixed volume of a Dhr1 expression extract. Mixtures were electrophoresed on 8% native gels, blotted, and probed with anti-BGAF sera (Fig.3). BGAF by itself and BGAF incubated with Glu1 served as negative and positive controls, respectively, in BGAF-Dhr1 binding assays.Figure 3Immunoblot (right panel) after native PAGE showing that the sorghum β-glucosidase Dhr1 does not bind BGAF , showing no evidence of BGAF removal, whereas Glu1 (left panel, positive control) binds BGAF , as evident from the absence of BGAF in lanes 2.5 and 5 μg/ml and significant decrease in 10 and 20 μg/ml. A fixed amount of Glu1 was incubated with BGAF at 2-fold decreasing increments of BGAF, electrophoresed on 8% native gels (anode atbottom), blotted, and probed with anti-BGAF serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N-terminal sequence of BGAF purified as described above was: (V/X)(I/E)(G/P) (N/L)YAPIGIGATV. The peptide APIGIGAT was used to design two (sense) degenerate primers (BGAF-6, CCNATHGGNATHGGNGCNAC; BGAF-7, GCNCCNATHGGNATHGGNGC). Messenger RNA was isolated from etiolated 2-day-old H95 shoots using oligo-dT-coated magnetic beads according to the vendor's protocol (Dynal). An oligo-dT primer was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis with avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega). To amplify the BGAF cDNA, the primers BGAF-6 and BGAF-7 were individually paired with the oligo-dT primer in separate PCR reactions. A PCR product of 1 kb was obtained, gel purified, and cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript II SK (±) for sequencing. A BLAST search of the maize EST data base “hit” three ESTs whose 3′-ends overlapped with the 5′-end of the BGAF cDNA. Of these, the longest one (459 bp, GenBank™ T70648) had the highest match (97%) and a 327-bp overlap with the 5′-end of the BGAF cDNA. A primer (BGAF-16, 5′-CAGCTCCTCATCTCAAGTGTG-3′) was derived from the extreme 5′-end of the EST T70648 and used with an extreme 3′-end primer (BGAF-12, 5′-CGATTCAAGTGCCAATCTCTGGC-3′) to amplify, clone, and sequence the longest possible cDNA from H95 by RT-PCR. The 1118-bp H95 BGAF cDNA sequence was utilized to design oligonucleotides to synthesize cDNAs encoding the mature (BGAF-13, sense, 5′-CATATGGCTAGCGTCATAGACAACAAGGCGCCG-3′; BGAF-12, antisense, 5′-CTATCTCGAGCGATTCAAGTGCCAATCTCTGGC-3′) and the precursor (BGAF-15, sense, 5′-CATATGGCTAGCATGGCCAGCCTCCAAGTGACTCC-3′; BGAF-14, antisense, 5′-CTATCTCGAGTCACAGGGATCGCACGTAAACG-3′) BGAF polypeptides for expression in E. coli. The cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pET21a. The E. colihost strain pLys S was transformed with the recombinant plasmid construct and used in expression studies. Expression of BGAF from the putative BGAF cDNA was corroborated by functional binding assays as described previously except crude BGAF expression extracts were used to incubate with purified Glu1. Additionally, BGAF expression extracts were electrophoresed on 12% (w/v) SDS gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205506) Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunostaining. The membranes were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-BGAF serum. The rabbit anti-BGAF IgG (1° antibody) binding was detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (2° antibody) using the peroxidase substrate 4-chloro-1-naphthol. To examine the molecular basis of the BGAF-β-glucosidase interaction and define the location of the putative binding site(s), chimeric β-glucosidases were constructed (Fig. 1 B). The interaction between BGAF and β-glucosidase is very specific and reminiscent of an antigen-antibody interaction, therefore, binding assays could be performed with both purified and unpurified ligands with no effect on assay sensitivity and specificity (11Esen A. Blanchard D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consequently, 7 (Dhr1, C-3, C-5, C-6, C-18, C-19, and C-26) out of 16 β-glucosidases were used as crude bacterial cell lysates in binding assays. When we tested intact Glu1 and Glu2 and a Glu2/Glu1 chimera (C-3) for BGAF binding, the gel-shift assay yielded positive binding results as evident from the formation of BGAF-β-glucosidase complexes with reduced electrophoretic mobility on native PAGE gels. Thus, β-glucosidase activity zones (bands) shifted toward the cathodic end of the gel and a smear extending from the top of the resolving gel to the sample well in the stacking gel was present (Fig. 2, lanes 4, 6, and 20). The binding assays also demonstrate that when the C-terminal 47 amino acids from either Glu1 or Glu2 are replaced with the corresponding C-terminal 53 amino acids from Dhr1 (as is the case with C-2 and C-4, respectively) BGAF binding activity is almost completely lost (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and10). However, when the C-terminal 23 amino acids of the Glu1/Dhr1 chimera C-2 are replaced by the C-terminal 17 amino acids of Glu1, which yielded C-16, BGAF binding activity is mostly restored (Fig. 2, lane 12). Not surprisingly, replacing the extreme C-terminal 17 amino acids of Glu1 by the 23 amino acids of Dhr1 (C-15) showed BGAF binding activity (Fig. 2, lane 14). The binding data from chimeras C-21 and C-22 show that BGAF binding becomes tighter when the disruptive region (from Dhr1) spanning amino acids Ser466-Leu495 of C-16 is bisected, yielding C-21 and C-22 (Fig. 2, lanes 16 and 18). In the case of Dhr1/Glu1 or Dhr1/Glu2 chimeras, in which the N-terminal Glu1 or Glu2 regions were replaced with the N-terminal Dhr1 regions varying from 127 (C-26) and 205 (C-19) to 461 amino acids long (C-18, data not shown), no BGAF binding to any of these three chimeras was observed (Fig. 2, lanes 26 and 28). In contrast, a Dhr1/Glu1 chimera (C-5) and a Dhr1/Glu2 chimera (C-6) in which the extreme N-terminal 29-amino acid-long segments of Glu1 and Glu2 were replaced with their Dhr1 homologue bind BGAF, indicating that this segment is not involved in BGAF binding (Fig. 2, lanes 22 and 24). However, C-5, which had the highest electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2, lane 21), produced predominantly two distinct bands after interaction with BGAF (Fig. 2,lane 22). The region spanning amino acids Glu50-Phe205 was bisected through the construction of chimera C-26 in which the N-terminal Ser1-Asn127 region of Glu1 was replaced with its Dhr1 homolog. Interestingly, C-26 did not have any BGAF binding activity (Fig. 2, lane 28) similar to C-19 (Fig. 2,lane 26), which establishes that the polypeptide segment spanning amino acids Glu50- Asn127 must contain the other region(s) of Glu1 or Glu2 that is involved in forming the BGAF binding site. Binding assays show that BGAF does not bind to Dhr1 (Fig. 3, right panel) where the results were similar to those obtained with negative control BGAF by itself and BGAF plusE. coli lysate (data not shown). In contrast, the amount of BGAF detectable by immunoblotting decreased as the amount of BGAF reacting with the positive tester β-glucosidase (Glu1) increased, because the resulting complex was unable to enter the gel (Fig. 3,left panel). Furthermore, Dhr1 did not bind BGAF in coprecipitation assays (data not shown) performed as described previously (11Esen A. Blanchard D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our structural analysis relative to mapping was on the three-dimensional structure of Glu1 resolved by x-ray crystallography in collaboration with Bernard Henrissat's crystallography group in Marseilles, France (27Czjzek M. Cicek M. Zamboni V. Bevan D.R. Henrissat B. Esen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13555-13560Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our initial finding that two regions (28 and 17 amino acids long) within the C-terminal 47 amino acids (based on data with C-15 and C-16) were each essential, but not sufficient, for BGAF binding led to the analysis of these regions on the surface of the Glu1 three-dimensional structure. It appears that the extreme 17-amino acid-long C-terminal region alone makes a greater contribution to BGAF recognition and binding than the 30-amino acid-long C-terminal region preceding it (cf. Fig. 2,lanes 12 and 14). To identify other polypeptide regions that are involved in BGAF binding, we scanned structural elements and amino acids located on the surface in the direct vicinity of the C-terminal 17 amino acids. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of Glu1 indicates that the N-terminal region maps proximally to the C-terminal region (Fig. 4). On this basis, chimeras C-5, C-6, C-19, and C-26 were tested for BGAF binding activity. Chimeras C-5 and C-6 had binding activity, whereas C-19 and C-26 did not. Collectively, these binding data indicate that the 77-amino acid-long region comprising amino acids Glu50-Asn127 in the N-terminal half contain the other determinant(s) that is (are) involved in BGAF binding, and they map to the surface proximal to certain residues from the C-terminal 47-amino acid-long region. Both the binding data and the structural data corroborate the postulate that binding requires the formation of a site through folding by two distant regions of the primary structure. The BGAF cDNA was cloned and sequenced as described above and reported (GenBank™ accession number AF232008). The longest BGAF cDNA isolated from H95 is 1118 bp long and includes a 918-bp coding sequence and a 43-bp 5′- and a 157-bp 3′-untranslated region. Fig.5 shows the deduced primary structure of the 306-amino acid-long putative BGAF precursor, which contains two octapeptide (G(P/R)WGGSGG) repeats that are separated by 40 amino acids. These two repeats are postulated to play an essential role in forming the sites involved in binding to β-glucosidase (see below). The experimentally determined N-terminal sequence VISNKAPIGI of the mature protein starts 38 amino acids after the first methionine in the precursor. Thus, the BGAF precursor has a 38-amino acid-long presequence (i.e. signal peptide), which leaves a mature protein that is 268 amino acids long after the cleavage of the signal peptide. Two BGAF cDNA expression constructs (one coding for the putative BGAF precursor and the other for the mature protein) were prepared and expressed inE. coli. The mature protein encoding BGAF cDNA was expressed in moderate amount, and it yielded a protein whose electrophoretic mobility was faster than BGAF isolated from plant tissue (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3 and 4). Yet, this smaller (27.5 kDa) recombinant BGAF protein was still able to bind and aggregate β-glucosidase (Fig.6 B, lane 4). In contrast, the putative precursor protein encoding BGAF cDNA yielded a protein (306-amino acid-long protein, calculated molecular mass 31.8 kDa) whose electrophoretic mobility was similar to that of BGAF isolated from plant tissue (Fig.6 A, lanes 5–7). The immunoblot analysis of the protein products of both BGAF cDNAs showed that they had the same immunoreactivity toward anti-BGAF serum as did BGAF extracted from maize shoots (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3–7). The immunoblotting data clearly indicated that the presumptive BGAF cDNAs encode polypeptides that have the same immunoreactivity with the anti-native BGAF serum as the native BGAF. More unequivocal evidence that the putative BGAF cDNAs encode BGAF came from functional assays. The gel-shift assay in Fig. 6 B(lanes 4 and 6) shows that BGAF expressed inE. coli binds β-glucosidase and retards its electrophoretic mobility in a manner identical to that obtained with native BGAF isolated from maize. The β-glucosidase null phenotype previously reported in maize is due to a specific interaction between the enzyme and an aggregating factor or BGAF (11Esen A. Blanchard D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The specificity of the interaction is proven by the fact that BGAF does not bind β-glucosidases from fungi (Trichoderma and Aspergillus) and other plant sources (e.g. almond, black cherry, sorghum, rice, and oats). We have cloned and sequenced the cDNA encoding BGAF (GenBank™ accession number AF232008) and identified BGAF as a member of the JAp family (16Thomma B.P.H.J. Eggermont K. Penninckx I.A.M.A. Mauch-Mani B. Vogelsang R. Cammue B.P.A. Broekaert W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15107-15111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 17Howe G.A. Lightner J.

The penultimate step, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICAR TFase), involves the transfer of the formyl group from a reduced folate substrate, (6R)N 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-f-FH4), to the exocyclic amino group of AICAR to form 5-formylaminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (FAICAR). The final step in the pathway, inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (IMPCHase), is a ring closure reaction of FAICAR forming inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP) and a molecule of water. Interest in ATIC partly comes from the fact that it is a potential chemotherapeutic target. AICAR TFase, along with the third enzymatic activity in the pathway, glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (TFase), utilizes the same reduced folate substrate making these two enzymes potential targets for anti-folate drugs. The anti-folate (6S/R)5,10-dideaza-5,6,7,8,-tetrahydrofolate (DDATHF) has been shown to be a potent antiproliferative agent, blocking de novo purine synthesis by inhibition of glycinamide ribonucleotide TFase and possibly AICAR TFase (1Baldwin S.W.

Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Sugita et al. (9Sugita T. Aya H. Ueno M. Ishizuka T. Kawashima K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) later found an additional form of hATIC cloned from a human placenta cDNA library. This isoform differs from our original form in the six N-terminal amino acids, as well as in a substitution of glycine for aspartate at position 165 (9Sugita T. Aya H. Ueno M. Ishizuka T. Kawashima K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We will refer to these isoforms as hATIC-a and hATIC-b, respectively. Because results from Sugita et al. (9Sugita T. Aya H. Ueno M. Ishizuka T. Kawashima K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) suggest that hATIC-b is more prevalent in human cells, this isoform of hATIC was used in all experiments described here. Previously reported experiments attempting to determine the oligomeric state of ATIC have yielded contradictory results. Enzyme cross-linking experiments using both yeast isoforms and the avian form of the enzyme suggest that ATIC may form a dimer (10Tibbetts A.S. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20920-20927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Mueller W.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Gel filtration experiments using recombinant human enzyme conducted by Rayl et al. (8Rayl E.A. Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) suggested that ATIC exists as a monomer under the conditions tested (8Rayl E.A. Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These apparently conflicting conclusions may actually both be valid, because the results depend greatly on the experimental conditions used to study the oligomeric properties of a protein. The questions of whether ATIC exists as a monomer or some other higher oligomeric species and which oligomeric form of the enzyme is the active species need to be addressed because of their importance for further understanding the structure-function relationships of this enzyme. This information will be critically important for postulating catalytic mechanisms for each activity and in the structure-based rational design of inhibitors targeting this enzyme. In this report we demonstrate that ATIC exists in a monomer/dimer equilibrium and that this equilibrium is perturbed when both a folate analog and AICAR substrate are present but is not significantly shifted when each substrate is added individually. Evidence in support of these conclusions comes primarily from sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation studies of hATIC with and without substrate. We also show that for the IMPCHase enzymatic activity, both oligomeric forms possess catalytic activity with the dimeric form being more active. For the AICAR TFase enzymatic activity, the dimer appears to be the active form with the monomer possessing little or no catalytic activity. To clone the hATIC-b isoform of hATIC, PCR was used to change the first six amino acids, as well as the glycine at position 164, in the original clone hATIC-a using pETHATNB-1800 (8Rayl E.A. Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) as the initial PCR template. The primers used in the initial PCR reaction to change the first six amino acids were as follows: ATIC-a/b sense, 5′-GAGTTAAGCTAGCATGGCTCCCGGCCAGCTCGCCTTATTTAGTGTCTCTGAC and ATIC antisense, 5′-CCCATGGATCCTCAGTGGTGGAAGAGCCGAAGGTTC. UniqueNheI and BamHI sites are underlined, and the sequence changes are indicated in bold. The PCR product was resolved on a 1% agarose gel, purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and double-digested with NheI and BamHI (New England BioLabs, Inc.). The resulting fragment was directionally cloned into the NheI andBamHI polylinker sites of expression vector pET28a(+) (Novagen, Inc.) using T4 DNA ligase (New England BioLabs, Inc.). Selection of these restriction sites incorporated an N-terminal histidine·tag onto the clone to facilitate purification. This new clone was named pEThybrid-a/b. Site-directed mutagenesis of G165D 2Because of an additional amino acid in the N terminus of hATIC-b, the glycine to aspartate difference is at position 165 in hATIC-b and at position 164 in hATIC-a. using the method of overlap extension (12Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) was then carried out using pEThybrid-a/b as the template. Two PCR reactions were carried out using the following primers: ATIC-b sense, 5′-GAGTTAAGCTAGCATGGCTCCCGGCCAGCTC and G165D reverse, 5′-CTCCAAGGAGGTGTCCTTACTCTCGGAGC in the first reaction, and G165D forward, 5′-CTCCGAGAGTAAGGACACCTCCTTGGAG and ATIC antisense (shown above) in the second reaction. The NheI site isunderlined in the ATIC-b sense primer, and the G165D mutation is indicated in bold. These PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and purified as above. These products were then used in a second PCR reaction acting as both primer and template along with the ATIC-b sense and ATIC antisense primers to generate the full-length ATIC-b cDNA containing NheI andBamHI restriction sites. This product was inserted into pET28a(+) as described above creating plasmid pETATIC-b. The sequence of this new clone was verified by automated sequencing at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer/W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Plasmid pETATIC-b was transformed into Escherichia coli Tuner™(DE3) (Novagen, Inc.) by heat shock. E. coli transformants were grown in 2YT bacterial media (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 50 μg/ml kanamycin (International Biotechnologies, Inc.) at 37 °C to anA 600 value between 0.6 and 0.8. These cultures were then induced with 400 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (American Bioanalytical) and grown at 30 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with cold 0.85% NaCl, and either used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Cell pellets were dissolved in cold lysis buffer (20 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl). The cell suspension was lysed by sonication on a Fisher sonic dismembraner, model 300. The lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C, 15,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman Ti45 rotor. The supernatant solution containing soluble ATIC protein was poured off and placed on ice. The immobilized metal affinity chromatography purification was performed on a BioCAD® Sprint chromatography work station (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a column containing POROS metal chelate media (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The column was charged with 5 column volumes (CV) of 0.1 mNiSO4·6H2O, washed with 10 CV of water, and equilibrated with 10 CV of 99.9% lysis buffer and 0.1% elution buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). The column was then loaded with 10–20 ml of cell lysate, washed with 99.9% lysis buffer and 0.1% elution buffer for 5 CV, and gradient-washed for 20 CV starting with 99.9% lysis buffer and 0.1% elution buffer and ending with 80.0% lysis buffer and 20.0% elution buffer. ATIC was eluted with 5 CV of 100% elution buffer collecting 2-ml fractions. The flow rate was 10 ml/min throughout the purification. Fractions were then assayed for either IMPCHase or AICAR TFase activity as described below. Those fractions containing activity were pooled and concentrated to 10–15 ml using a 250-ml Amicon ultrafiltration cell with a Diaflo YM30 ultrafiltration membrane (Amicon, Inc.). The protein solution was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200-pg gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and washed with HB buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol) at a rate of 1 ml/min for 150 ml on a fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions (1 ml) containing activity were pooled and stored at 4 °C in HB buffer until needed.

A Beckman OptimaTM XL-I ultracentrifuge was used to determine the equilibrium distribution of hATIC-b in HB buffer using the Rayleigh interference optics to visualize the protein. The interference experiments were carried out using external loading two-sector cells with sapphire windows. Data were collected at 4 °C at three initial concentrations of 3.5, 8.7, and 10.7 μm for hATIC-b at rotor speeds of 10,800, 13,300, and 16,000 rpm. For all experiments, water-water blanks were obtained at each speed prior to running the solutions of interest without disassembly of the cells between runs. Both the sample and buffer volumes were 125 μl. The effect of substrates/inhibitors upon the equilibrium distribution was also investigated. The hATIC-b samples contained 200 μm AICAR with 2.1 and 9.1 μm enzyme, 1 mm 10-f-FH4 with 2.7 and 5.1 μmenzyme, or both 200 μm AICAR and 500 μmDDATHF (18Taylor E.C. Harrington P.J. Fletcher S.R.

This value was calculated to be 0.7304 ml/g at 4 °C. Sednterp also calculated the solvent density to be 1.01004 g/ml at 4 °C and the monomer molecular mass of ATIC-b to be 67,314. Data in fringe units were converted to molar concentrations using the constant 3.33 fringes·mg−1·ml−1 protein and the predicted monomer molecular mass. Using the determined dissociation constant from the sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, enzyme stock assay solutions ranging from 8.6 nm to 4.3 μm and spanning the percent dimer distribution curve from 6 to 77% were made. Initial stock solutions of hATIC-b were diluted to obtain the final concentration in each assay solution. The concentrations of these initial stocks were determined using Pierce Coomassie®Plus protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Each assay solution contained 66 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, and enzyme. The solutions were allowed to reach their oligomeric equilibrium for at least 48 h at 4 °C in the cold room. The next day, separate assays for AICAR TFase and IMPCHase activity were performed at 4 °C as described above using a 0.1-cm pathlength quartz cuvette. The reaction volume of each assay was 200 μl with the final concentrations of each of the substrates, 10-f-FH4 and AICAR for the AICAR TFase assay and FAICAR for the IMPCHase assay, at 0.5 mm. All assay and substrate solutions were kept at a constant temperature in the cold room before being assayed. Reactions were initiated by the rapid mixing of substrate and assay solution in the cuvette. The rapid quench experiments were carried out at 37 °C using a KinTek RFQ-3 rapid chemical quench apparatus (KinTek Instruments, State College, PA). Reactions were initiated by mixing 15 μl of enzyme with 15 μl of substrate solution containing [3H]AICAR (10–20 Ci/mmol; Moravek Biochemicals) and 10-f-FH4. The reaction buffer contained 50 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The concentrations of enzyme and substrates cited in the text are those after mixing and during the reaction. Reactions were terminated by quenching with 67 μl of triethylamine (Sigma) and collected in 1.5-ml tubes containing 70 μl of chloroform (J. T. Baker, Inc.). Tubes were immediately vortexed and kept on ice until all of the samples in the set were collected. Samples were then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min to separate the aqueous and organic phases. The aqueous phase was transferred to a clean tube, lyophilized, and redissolved in 8 μl of water for subsequent TLC separation on POLYGRAM® CEL 300 polyethyleneimine/UV254 TLC plates (Macherey-Nagel, GmbH & Co. Kg). TLC separation of substrates and products was carried out by slight modification of the method described previously (21Szabados E. Christopherson R.I. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 401-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-steady state burst experiments were fit using the curve-fitting program, KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software), to the burst equation, y=A1−e−kt+AkSStEquation 1 where A = amplitude of the burst phase,k = observed burst rate, k ss = steady state or linear phase rate, and t = time. Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was used to examine the oligomeric structure of hATIC in solution. A global nonlinear least squares analysis using Winnl106 was carried out on nine data sets obtained from three initial protein concentrations and three rotor speeds. The residuals of the fitting trials suggest that the simplest model that adequately describes the data contains three species with molecular weights corresponding to an ATIC monomer, dimer, and trimer. The formal expression is as follows: ci=crefexpσξi−ξref+cref2K1,2exp2σξi−ξref+cref,nmerexpnσξi−ξref+base where σ=M(1−v¯ρ)ω22RTEquation 2 where c i is the total fringe displacement at a radial position, ri,c ref is the fringe displacement at a reference position r ref, M is the monomer molecular mass, ν̄ is the monomer partial specific volume, ρ is the solvent density, ω is the angular velocity (radians·sec−1), R is ri, the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature,ξ = r 2/2,K 1,2 is the apparent monomer/dimer equilibrium constant (in fringe units) that was common for all data sets, andbase is a baseline term for nonsedimentating material. A typical distribution at 13,300 rpm is shown in Fig.2. The fit was judged to be good by examination of the residuals (small and random) and minimization of the variance (1.13 × 10−2 with 2397 degrees of freedom). From this global fit, the dimer/monomer dissociation constant was estimated to be 240 ± 50 nm at 4 °C using Equation2. Attempts to globally fit the data using a fitting function containing a common monomer-trimer dissociation constant for all data sets failed to converge as indicated by nonrandomness of the residuals and significant increase in the variance (data not shown). The global analysis thus suggests that the trimer does not reversibly associate with the other species on the time scale of this experiment and is considered thermodynamically heterogeneous. The observation of a monomer/dimer equilibrium in this concentration range raises the possibility that the presence of substrates may affect the activity of ATIC by affecting the monomer/dimer equilibrium. Thus it is important to determine how the substrates influence the oligomeric state and which oligomeric form of ATIC is active for both the AICAR TFase and IMPCHase activities. To determine whether the monomer/dimer equilibrium of ATIC is shifted in the presence of one or more of its substrates, the sedimentation equilibrium experiments were repeated with solutions containing AICAR, 10-f-FH4, or AICAR and the folate analog DDATHF at concentrations 10 times theK m or the K i in the case of DDATHF (4Beardsley G.

A global nonlinear analysis was carried out as above using two initial concentrations at three rotor speeds for each of the above conditions using Winnl106. The simplest model that fit all the data sets for each condition tested contained three species corresponding to ATIC monomer, dimer, and some heterogeneous trimeric species as before. The results of these studies and their fit statistics are summarized in Table I. As seen in Fig. 3, in the presence of AICAR or 10-f-FH4, the percent dimeric species is not significantly shifted from that of apo-hATIC. However, when both AICAR and the folate analog DDATHF are present, there is a considerable shift toward higher percent dimer in the molar species plot showing a relationship between the substrates and the oligomeric state of hATIC.Table IEffect of substrates on the dissociation constant for hATICCondition testedK d (nm)Square root of the variancehATIC alone240 ± 501.13 × 10−2 with 2397 degrees of freedom+ AICAR160 ± 309.64 × 10−3 with 1791 degrees of freedom+ 10-f-FH4150 ± 308.63 × 10−3 with 1761 degrees of freedom+ DDATHF and AICAR31 ± 99.82 × 10−3 with 1686 degrees of freedomCentrifuge data were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” for each of the conditions below.

The estimated dissociation constants for each of the substrate conditions are summarized below, along with the variance from each of the global fits. All data were globally fit using Equation 2, with a monomer/dimer equilibrium with some nonequilibrating trimer. Knowing that the oligomeric equilibrium is affected by the presence of both AICAR and DDATHF, the concentration dependence of ATIC was investigated to determine whether the amount of dimeric protein has a correlation to the AICAR TFase activity. To study this, steady state assays were performed within a concentration range of protein based upon the percent dimer curve in Fig. 3. The AICAR and 10-f-FH4substrates were concentrated so that the addition of the substrate mixture to the assay solution would not change the total volume by more than 5%. The concentration of substrate used was greater than 100 times the highest enzyme concentration and kept constant throughout so that binding would not be a concern during the experiment. The results shown in Fig. 4 suggest that upon increasing enzyme concentration, the AICAR TFase activity also increases. Correcting the predicted percent dimer for the effect of DDATHF and AICAR on the dissociation constant resulted in a statistically better linear fit of the data (r = 0.9769) (Fig. 4, inset). Extrapolation of this linear fit to zero percent dimer predicted a specific activity of only 0.03 μmol·min−1·mg−1. This suggests that the monomeric form of ATIC is essentially inactive, especially when compared with the dimer's specific activity of 1.1 μmol·min−1·mg−1 found by extrapolation to 100% dimer. The result that the dimer is the active form of ATIC for AICAR TFase activity is further supported by the results of pre-steady state burst assays carried out at protein concentrations ranging from 20 to 100 μm corresponding to 92 to 97% dimer. Fig.5 shows a typical pre-steady state AICAR TFase burst experiment using a final concentration of 20 μm ATIC carried out at 37 °C. A fit of these data using Equation 1 results in an amplitude of 20 μm, which suggests that 100% of the AICAR TFase catalytic sites are active at this enzyme concentration. An analogous set of experiments for the IMPCHase activity were also carried out on hATIC. The substrate FAICAR was concentrated so that the addition of the substrate mixture to the assay solution would not change the total volume by more than 5%. The concentration of substrate used was greater than 100 times the highest enzyme concentration"

The process begins with sequence-specific DNA recognition of the promoter. Two primary recognition elements, TATA and initiator (Inr),1 have been extensively studied (reviewed in Ref. 1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these elements is recognized by specific proteins as follows: TATA by the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and Inr by several proteins including TBP-associated factors. In addition to recognition, these elements also play regulatory roles. TATA has been shown to play a role in setting the rate of transcription reinitiation (2Yean D. Gralla J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3809-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Yean D. Gralla J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas Inr can play a role in activation (4Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although much is now known about the roles of TATA and Inr, comparatively little is known about possible roles for other sequences within the core promoter. Ultraviolet cross-linking experiments have shown that several transcription factors are in intimate contact with the DNA throughout the core promoter region. TFIIA, IIB, IIE, IIF, TBP-associated factors, and polymerase II subunits all cross-link to regions between −50 and +15 relative to the transcription start site (5Robert F. Forget D. Li J. Greenblatt J. Coulombe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8517-8520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Lagrange T. Kim T.K. Orphanides G. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19962-19967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these sequences have the potential to influence the binding or functionality of these factors. Although no core consensus sequence exists outside the TATA and Inr elements, there are clear nucleotide preferences, with the majority of promoters being GC-rich (9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Two recent studies have investigated the roles of non-TATA, non-Inr sequences. A GC-rich sequence upstream from TATA (the BRE) can enhance TFIIB binding to the TBP·DNA complex and stimulate basal transcription (10Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Sequences both upstream and downstream from TATA can affect transcription; these can alter both basal and activated levels independently (9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The latter observations were based on “block-swapped” promoters in which blocks of sequences were exchanged among promoters, and transcription and factor binding were assayed. Bandshift analyses showed that the 10-base pair blocks flanking the TATA box play roles in both TBP and TFIIB binding. For example, replacing either (or both) of these blocks in the more GC-rich adenovirus ML promoter with the corresponding AT-rich sequences from the E4 promoter lowered the level of TBP binding. Two aspects of these results were unexpected. First, there were no prior indications of a role for the block downstream from TATA in transcription. Second, the TBP binding results are difficult to explain as there is no prior evidence that TBP contacts sequences that flank TATA; crystallographic and UV cross-linking studies have suggested that TBP makes contacts only within the TATA box region (11Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Hoffman A. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4862-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 12Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 13Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Of course the effects on TBP binding and on transcription could be closely related. One possibility for the role of these sequence blocks is that surrounding the AT-rich TATA element with GC-rich sequences (as in the ML case) could make the TATA box more distinctive as TBP scans the DNA for the correct binding site. At an AT-rich promoter the TBP search might be slowed if nearby TATA-like sequences are present, and this would be reflected by a lower rate of association. A different possibility is that AT-rich and GC-rich sequences take on unique structures and that the borders between these sequences form discontinuities. Boundary discontinuities such as heteroduplex bubbles have been shown to stabilize TBP binding, and this effects only the dissociation rate, making it slower (14Grove A. Galeone A., Yu, E. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Below we measure the kinetics of TBP interactions with block-swapped promoters to assess these explicit possibilities and provide additional constraints on models for the roles of flanking sequences. The data strongly favor the discontinuity effect. The prior data also left unexplained an observed variation in the effect of TFIIB. In all cases the amount of TBP·TFIIB·TATA complex formed correlated with the level of basal transcription. However, the effect of TFIIB on driving TATA DNA into complexes was substantially greater in one context: when the upstream block was GC-rich and the downstream block was AT-rich. We searched for a source for this phenomenon by studying the kinetics of TFIIB·TBP·DNA complexes, which had not been done previously. The outcome provides an explanation in terms of TFIIB having different effects on the rates of formation and rates of decay of these complexes depending on promoter context. Overall, the data suggest how blocks that flank TATA can influence the kinetics of factor binding in unique ways and thus enhance the potential for diversity in transcriptional regulation. Probes for gel shifts were made by annealing pairs of 49-nucleotide-long oligonucleotides (Operon) with 20 base pairs of complementarity at their 3′ ends (see Ref. 9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Equimolar (1 nmol) amounts of each oligonucleotide were annealed in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl in a 25-μl volume by rapid heating to 95 °C and slowly cooling to room temperature in a polymerase chain reaction thermocycler (MJ Research). The overhanging ends were filled by mixing the 25-μl annealing reactions with 7.5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 33 μm each dNTP, and 5 units of Klenow enzyme (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 50 μl and incubating for 1 h at room temperature. DNA was precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol, dissolved in 8 m urea, 0.5× TBE and purified on 12%urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8 m urea, 29:1 ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide, 0.5× TBE). The highest molecular weight bands were visualized by UV shadowing and excised from the gel. The gel slices were crushed to beads and soaked overnight in 1 ml of 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C. The beads were then spun down in a centrifuge and the supernatant recovered. DNA was again precipitated and dissolved in Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. The concentration of DNA was determined by heating the DNA to 95 °C to denature and taking the absorbance at 260 nm. The absorbance was multiplied by 33 μg/ml to determine the total concentration of single strands. The probes were labeled by mixing 1.8 pmol of total single-stranded DNA with 25 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP and 3 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) in 25 μl and incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. Labeled DNA was separated from free nucleotides though a 1-ml G-50/TE spin column. The eluates were mixed with 80 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, in a final volume of 45 μl, and polymerase chain reaction was annealed as above. The final concentration of double-stranded probe was 20 nm. The annealed products were run on 5%native gels (59:1 ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide, 0.5× TBE) to verify the annealing and on 12%urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see above) to verify the Klenow extension. These probes contain the ML and/or E4 promoter sequences from −41 to +18 flanked by restriction sites. Full-length, His-tagged human TBP (15Bryant G.O. Martel L.S. Burley S.K. Berk A.J.

Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 fmol of labeled probe was mixed with the indicated amounts of TBP and TFIIB in a 10-μl reaction that contained 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 12%glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.6 mmDTT, 8 mm MgCl2, 50 ng of poly(dG·dC), and 500 ng of bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Proteins were bound at 30 °C for the indicated times and loaded directly onto prechilled 5%native gels (59:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 5%glycerol, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5× TBE) and run in prechilled 0.5× TBE, 2 mm MgCl2 buffer. Gels were run in Bio-Rad mini-Protean 3 units at 400 V for 30 min. The temperature of the inner tank and gels never exceeded 25 °C. The gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics) for 16 h. Time course experiments were initiated by adding protein and probe to reaction mixtures containing all the remaining components (see above). Time points were initiated at intervals so that they could all be loaded on the gel at the same time, ensuring that any dissociation of complexes in the gel would be constant for all samples. The indicated amounts of protein were bound to DNA for various times before loading on gels. The appropriate shifted complexes were quantitated using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). The raw data (counts) were fitted by nonlinear least squares regression to Equation 1, Ft=Ffinal(1−e−k(obs)t)Equation 1 using the SigmaPlot (SPSS, Inc.) program for PC.kobs and Ffinal are the calculated first-order rate constant and calculated fraction bound at the completion of the reaction, respectively. In many cases the raw data at each time point were normalized toFfinal for plotting. The half-time of association is given by Equation 2, t1/2=ln(2)/kobsEquation 2 Second-order rate constants for TBP binding were determined by plotting the reciprocal of the kobs determined at each concentration of TBP versus the reciprocal of the TBP concentration. kon was then taken as the reciprocal of the slope of this plot. The indicated amounts of protein were bound to DNA for 1 h and then challenged with 20 ng/μl poly(dI·dC) for the indicated times. As above, each time point was initiated at intervals and then challenged after 1 h so that all time points could be loaded simultaneously. Addition of poly-(dI·dC) prior to probe results in no detectable binding (data not shown). The bands were quantitated and fit by nonlinear least squares regression to Equation 3, Ft=F0(e−k(off)t)Equation 3 where F0 is the calculated starting fraction bound and koff the calculated rate constant. The half-life of the complex is given byt 12= ln(2)/koff, and the dissociation constant for TBP is given by KD =koff/kon. We showed previously that replacing either or both of the 10-base pair GC-rich blocks flanking the ML TATA box with the more mixed sequence blocks from the adenovirus E4 promoter led to a significant decrease in the level of TBP binding (9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). TBP does not contact these sequences directly, leaving the source of the effect unknown. To help distinguish between various models (see Introduction), we measured whether the altered binding was due to changes in on-rate or off-rate or both. We performed on-rate experiments using the promoter constructs shown in Fig. 1. Standard bandshift experiments were used to assess the level of TBP binding at various times after mixing with promoter DNA. An autoradiograph from one such experiment is shown in Fig. 2 A. With TBP at 20 nm, binding becomes detectable as early as 1 min after addition of probe and continues to rise until reaching saturation at about 20 min. The half-time to saturation is ∼5 min. The bands were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis and fit to Equation 1, see under “Experimental Procedures.” The data and best fit curve are plotted in Fig. 2 B. This reaction appears to follow first-order kinetics with a kobs of 2.7 × 10−3 s−1. The concentration of TBP in this experiment (20 nm) is comparable to the KD for TBP dimerization (10 nm, see Ref. 17Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and yet we do not see the apparent two-phase kinetics that might be expected if dissociation of TBP dimers were rate-limiting (17Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This first order behavior may be related to the limiting amounts of DNA used in these assays.Figure 2Time course of TBP binding.

The half-time is 4.3 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On-rates for all four probes were determined at 20 nm TBP, and the values are shown in Table I. Only promoter M-E12 shows a difference at 20 nm TBP, and this effect is small. The experiment was repeated at different concentrations of TBP. The changes in the observed on-rates are proportional to the changes in TBP concentration, but this occurs similarly for each promoter. We determined the apparent rate constantkon for TBP binding for each promoter, and these values are also shown in Table I. The kon for the parent ML promoter of 1.3 × 105m−1 s−1is comparable to published values (14Grove A. Galeone A., Yu, E. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol.

Thekon values for the swapped promoters are not significantly different from the parent ML promoter. We conclude that the TATA-flanking blocks have little effect on the association rate constant for TBP binding.Table IKinetics of TBP bindingPromoterOn-rates (× 10−4s−1)konkoffKD5 nm10 nm20 nmm−1s−1s−1mMLP6.416251.3 × 1051.3 × 10−41.0 × 10−9M-E16.115241.2 × 1052.2 × 10−41.8 × 10−9M-E25.718251.1 × 1052.9 × 10−42.7 × 10−9M-E125.216340.9 × 1052.8 × 10−43.1 × 10−9Values shown are averages of 2–3 trials each with an error of 15%or less.

Since the TATA-flanking blocks have no apparent effect on the on-rate of TBP binding, we tested whether they affect the off-rates. We chose to use TBP at 5 nm since that is the concentration used in the prior study (9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). TBP·DNA complexes were formed at 30 °C for 60 min to ensure that binding had reached equilibrium and then challenged with 20 ng/μl poly(dI·dC). Addition of this competitor prior to adding TBP prevented binding to the probe so it serves as an effective sink for dissociated TBP (data not shown). Examples of off-rate experiments are shown in Fig.3 A. The data from several such experiments were fit to Equation 3 and averaged. The averagekoff for the parent ML probe is 1.3 × 10−4 s−1. This rate and the dissociation constant (KD) of 1 × 10−9m (Table I) are both consistent with published data (14Grove A. Galeone A., Yu, E. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol.

The experiment was repeated using promoters in which the flanking sequence blocks had been swapped. A sample autoradiograph comparing two promoters is shown in Fig. 3 A with the data analysis in Fig.3 B. The difference between the two curves (closed circles, ML; open circles, M-E12) is approximately a factor of 2. A similar 2-fold difference was seen with the other block-swapped promoters (compare off-rates in Table I). The half-life of TBP on the ML promoter is nearly 90 min while the half-lives for the other promoters range from 40 to 50 min. This indicates that TBP is less stably bound to the block-swapped promoters than to the ML parent and demonstrates a kinetic role for both flanking sequences. We conclude that the sequences that flank TATA affect the stability of TBP binding without altering the rate at which TBP locates the TATA box. The sequence of the block upstream from TATA (block 1) is known to influence TFIIB binding (10Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In general, TFIIB binding enhances the binding of TBP to the TATA box. It is not known whether these stabilizing effects are due to faster on-rate, slower off-rate, or both. In the series of block-swapped promoters studied here, the sequence of the ML block 1 is expected to bind TFIIB better than block 1 from E4 as it provides a much better match to the GC-rich consensus (10Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The effect of TFIIB on TBP binding is known not to be uniform among this promoter set (9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The greatest contribution of TFIIB to TBP binding is made with promoter M-E2, which has the ML sequence upstream from TATA and the E4 sequence downstream. To learn why this sequence-specific effect occurs and to locate the general kinetic sources of the TFIIB effect on TBP binding to TATA, we established rate assays for formation of the ternary complex containing TBP, TFIIB, and TATA DNA. We looked first at the effect of TFIIB on off-rates. The kinetic analysis is potentially complicated because either TBP or TFIIB could be released first. However, if TBP were released first then TFIIB would effectively be released concurrently because it cannot bind these DNA templates on its own (9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As shown below the dissociation also does not include a pathway in which TFIIB only is released. Thus we can monitor dissociation by following the joint loss of TFIIB and TBP. The experiment is similar to that described above, adding poly(dI·dC) to preformed complexes as a sink for released TBP. Although this has not been done previously for the TFIIB·TBP·DNA complex, a similar experiment was used to measure the bulk off-rate of TFIIA and TBP from a promoter containing the ML TATA box (20Weideman C.A. Netter R.C. Benjamin L.R. McAllister J.J. Schmiedekamp L.A. Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TBP, TFIIB, and labeled DNA were preincubated for 60 min to ensure that binding had reached equilibrium. The complexes were then challenged with poly(dI·dC). At no time during the decay phase of these reactions is a TBP:DNA intermediate observed (Fig.4 A), and TFIIB does not bind to these promoters in the absence of TBP (9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This verifies that the poly(dI·dC) challenge measures the bulk off-rate of TBP + TFIIB and demonstrates that these two proteins come off the DNA as a unit. Fig. 4 B shows that TFIIB (open circles) decreases the rate of decay compared with TBP alone (closed circles). The TFIIB·TBP·DNA complex decays at about half the rate of the TBP·DNA complex. The kinetic effect shows no promoter specificity; the rates of decay (koff) for all four promoters are decreased similarly by TFIIB with an average decrease of 2.3-fold (compare off-rates in Table II for TBP + TFIIB to those in Table I for TBP alone). Two conclusions are drawn. One is that the well known ability of TFIIB to enhance TBP binding has a source in the slowing of the TBP decay rate. The second is more surprising. Because TBP can bind TATA well in the absence of TFIIB one would expect it to remain bound after TFIIB dissociates. However, that was not observed. It appears that the TFIIB stabilization is accompanied by a change in state that requires that the two proteins dissociate jointly.Table IIKinetics of TFIIB + TBP bindingPromoterkoffOn-rateMLP0.68.6M-E11.37.7M-E21.215M-E121.08.7Measured at 5 nm TBP, 20 nm TFIIB; all rates are ×10−4 s−1. Open table in a new tab Measured at 5 nm TBP, 20 nm TFIIB; all rates are ×10−4 s−1. These effects appear to be sequence-nonspecific. Therefore, one aspect of the prior data remains unexplained. The TFIIB effect on TBP promoter binding is greater for M-E2 than at other promoters (9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As the data show that the source of this was not the off-rate (2.4-fold stimulation for M-E2 versus a 2.3-fold average), we investigated the on-rate. TFIIB·TBP·DNA complexes were assembled under the conditions used previously (9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar): 5 nm TBP, 20 nm TFIIB and 0.1 nm DNA were mixed and incubated at 30 °C for various times. An example of an autoradiograph from such a time course is shown in Fig. 5 A. Lane 1 contains only TBP (60 min) as a marker. Arrows indicate the locations of TBP·DNA and TFIIB·TBP·DNA complexes. No band is seen in the position expected for the TBP·DNA binary complex, indicating that the ternary complex forms cooperatively. A comparison of M-E2 and the ML parent is shown in the association rate curves of Fig. 5 B, and normalized data for association with each of the four promoters are shown in Table II. TFIIB causes a very slight acceleration of binding on three of these promoters, but the effect on M-E2 is much greater, nearly 3-fold (compare on-rates in Table II to those for 5 nm TBP in Table I). Combined with the 2-fold effect on off-rate, this accounts for roughly a 6-fold increase in binding on M-E2. This compares with the observed 8-fold increase in overall binding seen previously when TFIIB was added to TBP at this promoter (9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus in addition to a nonspecific stabilization against decay, TFIIB can assist TBP binding via a sequence-specific acceleration of binding rate. This latter occurs with only one of the four promoters studied. These data indicate two roles for TFIIB as follows: a general strengthening of bound TBP against decay, and a sequence-dependent enhancement of the rate of TBP binding to TATA. The M-E2 promoter that has the enhanced on-rate has a unique combination of elements upstream and downstream from TATA. Its upstream block from the ML promoter has a resemblance to the consensus TFIIB-binding site (BRE). Its downstream block from the E4 promoter weakens TBP binding (9Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). How TFIIB can selectively enhance the binding on-rate for promoter M-E2 is not clear, but two possibilities can be considered. One is that the unique combination of ML block 1 with E4 block 2 creates a novel site that binds TFIIB rapidly. Alternatively, the loosely bound TBP, destabilized by the E4 block 2 sequence, may be configured in a manner that can bind TFIIB rapidly if a strong BRE is present. We sought to mimic this second possibility by directly weakening TBP binding via TATA mutation within the parent ML promoter. The question is, will the BRE, silent when embedded in the ML but not the M-E2 promoter, now also show function in the ML context with a nonconsensus TATA box? To examine this possibility a new series of promoters was constructed (see Fig. 6 A). The 2T mutation replaces the two adenosines at positions −27 and −28 in the ML TATA box with thymidines (underlined Ts in Fig. 6 A) in the context of the parent ML promoter (to form the ML-2T promoter). The substitutions were chosen to reduce TBP affinity without causing the drastic decreases in binding associated with “weak” TATA boxes. This mutation decreases the lifetime of TBP binding (21Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) without affecting the association rate (19Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1015-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The reduction in affinity is comparable to that caused by the M-E1 substitution. We measured the on- and off-rates for TBP and TBP + TFIIB on this mutant parent and the series of block-swapped promoters also containing the TATA mutation (Fig. 6 A). Initial control experiments confirmed that the 2T mutation led to more rapid decay of TBP from binary complexes (see Fig. 6 B, upper row and TBP off-rates in Table III). The rate of TBP decay from ML-2T is comparable to the rate from M-E1, indicating that the 2T mutation does indeed destabilize TBP binding. Further destabilization was not seen for the block-swapped 2T promoters indicating that the effects of TATA and the adjacent sequences are not cumulative in this context. Next, TFIIB was added to the mutant promoter, and the rate of decay of ternary complexes was determined (Fig. 6 B, lower row). The TATA mutation led to destabilization of ternary complexes (Table III) as it had for the binary complexes at the same promoter. Yet again this effect was not seen when the flanking sequences were changed.Table IIIKinetics of factor binding to 2T series of promotersPromoterOff-rates (× 10−4 s−1)On-rates (× 10−4 s−1)On-rate ratio 3-aRatio of rate of ternary complex formation to"
https://openalex.org/W1973296144,"The IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK/mPLK) is linked to the regulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent gene expression. Here we describe a novel binding partner of IRAK/mPLK that we term SIMPL (signaling molecule that associates with the mouse pelle-like kinase). Overexpression of SIMPL leads to the activation of NF-κB-dependent promoters, and inactivation of SIMPL inhibits IRAK/mPLK as well as tumor necrosis factor receptor type I-induced NF-κB activity. Dominant inhibitory alleles of IκB kinase (IKKα or IKKβ) block the activation of NF-κB by IRAK/mPLK and SIMPL. Furthermore, SIMPL binds IRAK/mPLK and the IKKs in vitro and in vivo. In the presence of antisense mRNA to SIMPL, the physical association between IRAK/mPLK and IKKβ but not IRAK/mPLK and IKKα is greatly diminished. Moreover, dominant-negative SIMPL blocks IKKα- or IKKβ-induced NF-κB activity. These results lead us to propose a model in which SIMPL functions to regulate NF-κB activity by linking IRAK/mPLK to IKKβ/α-containing complexes.AF093135"

These cytokines signal through their respective receptor systems that comprise a ligand-specific α-subunit and the common signal-transducing β-subunit, gp130. The shared use of gp130, in part, provides a molecular basis for the functional redundancy of the gp130 cytokines. The result of gp130-mediated signaling is the regulation of a variety of complex cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and gene activation in a wide variety of adult tissue systems, owing to the ubiquitous expression of gp130 (6Kishimoto T.

Intracellular signaling by the gp130 cytokines is initiated by the ligand first making low affinity (∼1 nm) contact with its cognate receptor α-subunit, which then recruits the signal transducing gp130 subunit with a resulting ligand-binding affinity of ∼10 pm.

Fuller G.M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) share an overall sequence identity of 85 and 88%, respectively, with that of human gp130.

The extracellular region of gp130 has a modular structure consisting of six domains of ∼100 amino acids each. The NH2-terminal domain (domain 1) is predicted to be a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig-like) (25Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol.

Nature. 1977; 268: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In the Ig-like fold, neighboring β-strands form hydrogen bonds in an antiparallel fashion to form a β-pleated sheet, and two β-sheets pack against each other to produce a hydrophobic core. Domains 2–6 of the gp130 are classified as fibronectin type III (FN III)-like modules, a subclass of the β-sandwich fold (26Vaughn D.E. Bjorkman P.J.

The topology of these domains is similar to those of the Ig-like modules, the notable exception being the “sheet switching” of β-strand D from the first β-sheet of an Ig-like domain to form β-strand C′ on the second β-sheet of FN III domains. The two membrane distal FN III domains (domains 2 and 3) form the cytokine-binding region (CBR) that is characteristic of class I cytokine receptors (28Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 29Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Oxford Press, Oxford1994: 1-16Google Scholar). CBRs are characterized by two conserved disulfide bonds in their NH2-terminal domain and a WSXWS motif in their COOH-terminal domain. The functional anatomy of the extracellular region of gp130 is still poorly understood. A truncated form of gp130 lacking the membrane-proximal FN III modules and the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains has been shown to bind a complex of either IL-6·sIL-6R or LIF·sLIF receptor (30Horsten U.

To elucidate the tertiary structure of the gp130 extracellular region, we have purified human sgp130 using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell expression system (13Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G.

This form of human sgp130 contains 11 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and 13 cysteine residues. Four cysteines are located in the Ig-like domain (domain 1), four are in the NH2-terminal FN III domain of the CBR (domain 2), one is in the COOH-terminal FN III domain of the CBR (domain 3), one is in domain 4, and three are in domain 5. Previously, we have shown that affinity purified sgp130 bound a binary complex of IL-6·sIL-6R with a 2:2:2 stoichiometry (13Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G. Yasukawa K. Hammacher A. Moritz R.L.

All buffers and solutions were prepared with deionized water purified and polished by a tandem Milli-RO and Milli-Q system (Millipore). Reverse phase (RP)-HPLC was performed using either a Vydac 5-μm, 300 Å octadecyl silica column (inner diameter, 250 × 4.6 mm) (Vydac) or a Brownlee RP-300 7-μm, 300 Å octylsilica column (inner diameter, 100 × 4.6 mm) (Applied Biosystems), operated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For capillary RP-HPLC, a fused silica column (inner diameter, 50 × 0.2 mm) was packed “in-house” with Brownlee RP-300 7-μm, 300 Å octylsilica (49Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 599: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For SEC, an analytical Superose 12 column (inner diameter, 300 × 10 mm) operated at 0.5 ml/min was employed. Rapid desalting and buffer exchange of proteins was performed using a Fast-desaltingTM column (Sephadex G25; inner diameter, 100 × 10 mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chromatography was performed using a HP-1090A Liquid Chromatograph (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a manual injector fitted into the column compartment, and a diode array UV detector was used for real time multiple wavelength monitoring of the column eluent. Samples were collected manually in polypropylene (Eppendorf) tubes. sgp130 was purified from the conditioned medium of CHO (G16) cells stably transfected with a plasmid (pECEdhfrgp620) that encodes the extracellular domain of gp130 truncated at amino acid 621 (44Yasukawa K. Futatsugi K. Saito M. Yawata H. Narazaki M. Suzuki H. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Lett. 1992; 31: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected CHO cells were grown in a large scale fermentation apparatus with a working volume of 1.25 liters (New Brunswick Celligen plus fermenter). Cell conditioned medium was concentrated (20-fold) by ultrafiltration using a Sartocon Mini apparatus (Sartorius, Germany) fitted with a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off filter. sgp130 was purified from concentrated CHO cell medium by binding to a 10-ml column of AM64-Sepharose and eluting sgp130 with 4 mMgCl2. sgp130 was further purified by preparative SEC (>95% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis), and sgp130-containing fractions were pooled, and buffer was exchanged using a Fast-desaltingTM column prior to storage at −20 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on precast 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Novex) using nonreducing or reducing (5.25% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) conditions and by isoelectrofocusing (IEF-PAGE) on precast linear pH gradient (pH 3–10) 5% polyacrylamide gels (Novex) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue as described (50Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). sgp130 (400 μg, 1 mg/ml) in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.025m EDTA was treated with 1 unit of neuraminidase and/or endoglycosidase mixture (37 °C, 16 h). Prior to disulfide determination, free cysteine residues in sgp130 (400 μg) were treated with a 5-fold molar excess of 4-vinylpyridine in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, for 1 h at 25 °C in the dark. The modified protein was buffer exchanged using a Fast-desaltingTM column operated at 1 ml/min. 4-Vinylpyridine was chosen as the alkylating agent becauseS-β-(4-pyridylethyl)-cysteine (Pec) containing peptides can be identified by their characteristic absorption spectra at 254 nm (51Friedman M. Krull L.H. Cavins J.F. J. Biol.

Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). sgp130 (400 μg) in 2 ml of 1% (w/v) ammonium bicarbonate, containing 2 mm calcium chloride, was digested at 37 °C for 16 h with either trypsin or chymotrypsin at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:20. For pepsin digestion, sgp130 (400 μg, ∼4 nmol) in 5% formic acid was digested for 1 h at 37 °C using an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:20. Resultant peptides were fractionated by RP-HPLC on either a Vydac C18 column or a Brownlee RP-300 column at 0.5 ml/min at 45 °C. The column eluent was split (∼1:160) post-detector, using a stainless steel Tee-union (52Cole A.R. Hall N.E. Treutlein H.R. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol.

For disulfide-containing peptide identification, a portion of the digest (25%) was reduced with 10 mm DTT at 45 °C for 1 h and rechromatographed under identical conditions. Peaks whose retention times shifted upon reduction were subjected to NH2-terminal sequence analysis. NH2-terminal sequence analyses were performed using a Hewlett-Packard biphasic NH2-terminal protein sequencer (model G1005A, Hewlett-Packard) using version 3.0 chemistry as described (50Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On-line MS analysis of peptide fractions was performed using either a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer or a TSQ-700 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, both equipped with an ESI source as described (50Moritz R.L.

Methods. 1994; 6: 213-226Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar).S-Pyridylethylated peptides were identified by parent-ion scanning using the TSQ mass spectrometer by monitoring all peptides for the labile protonated S-pyridylethyl group (m/z 106) following CID. Source CID/single ion monitoring using the LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer was employed to identify S-pyridylethyl cysteine-containing peptides as described (52Cole A.R. Hall N.E. Treutlein H.R.

Peptides were identified from their CID product ion spectra using either the Finnigan Xcalibur-Biomass software or Protein Prospector MS-Product algorithm (ProteinProspector Pacific-Rim mirror). Peptides analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Kompact MALDI-IV fitted with a 337 nm laser, Kratos) were co-crystallized with α-cyano 4-hydroxycinnaminic acid (16 mg of matrix/ml aqueous 60% acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). Matrix (0.5 μl) was deposited onto a clean sample slide immediately followed by 0.5 μl of peptide fraction. Spectra were calibrated using the external standards angiotensin (1297.5 [M+H]1+) and a matrix-derived ion (173.17 [M+H]1+). Domain 5 of sgp130 was modeled using the two FN III domains from the structure of the cytoplasmic tail of human integrin α6β4 (54de Pereda J.M. Wiche G. Liddington R.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which showed 19 and 16% amino acid sequence identity. These particular FN III domains were chosen as templates to minimize the insertions and deletions in the loop regions. The coordinates for the template were taken from the Protein Data Bank entry 1qg3. Domain 5 of sgp130 was manually aligned with the template of the cytoplasmic tail of integrin α6β crystal structure (54de Pereda J.M. Wiche G. Liddington R.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), conserving the hydrophobic and sequence patterns of the FN III β-sheets. The MODELLER program (55Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) was used to generate a model of FN III domain 5. The quality of the model was assessed as described (56Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in particular using the ProsaII program (57Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). A disulfide restraint between Cys436 and Cys444 in FN III domain 5 was introduced in accordance with our experimental results. Over 100 models of domain 5 were generated with the final model being chosen on the basis of the quality checks described. The final model of gp130 domain 5 follows integrin α6β4 domain 1 in the B-C and C′-E loops, and follows domain 2 in the C-C′ loop and G strand. The ProsaII Z-score of the final model is −6.26, comparing favorably with −4.70 and −6.39 for the templates"
https://openalex.org/W1992735344,"Abstract We have analyzed the efficiency and accuracy of polymerization at several different stages during the initiation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (+)-strand DNA synthesis. This reaction is of particular interest, as it involves the recruitment by reverse transcriptase of an RNA primer that serves as substrate for both the polymerase and RNase H activities of the enzyme. We found that the correct incorporation of the first two nucleotides was severely compromised and that formation of mismatches was completely absent at this stage of initiation. Although the fidelity of incorporations decreased concomitantly with ensuing polymerization, the elongation of mispaired primers was literally blocked. Instead, mispaired primer strands initiated a switch from active synthesis of DNA to premature RNase H-mediated primer removal. These findings suggest the existence of a fragile equilibrium between these two enzymatic activities that is shifted toward RNase H cleavage once the polymerization process is aggravated. Our data show that the initiation of HIV-1 (+)-strand DNA synthesis differs significantly from reactions involving other primer/template combinations, including tRNA-primed (−)-strand DNA synthesis."

The arrests are preceded by a rapid decrease in kinase activities of cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin B1-Cdc2, which are critical for G1-S and G2-M progression, respectively. IL-1 quickly enhances the protein expression of the CDK inhibitor p21cip1. The induced p21 binds preferentially to cyclin E-Cdk2, and the increase in p21 binding parallels the decrease in cyclin E-Cdk2 activity. Thus, p21 is likely to be responsible for the inhibition of cyclin E-Cdk2 activity and G1 arrest. Coinciding with the decrease in cyclin B1-Cdc2 activity, there is an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc2, suggesting that an increase in the inactive Tyr-15-phosphorylated form of Cdc2 is involved in the decrease in cyclin B1-Cdc2 activity and G2 arrest. Furthermore, we found that IL-1 causes rapid dephosphorylation of p107, but not of pRb or p130, while the total protein levels of p130 are increased.

A highly susceptible human melanoma cell line, A375-C6, is commonly used to study the mechanism of the IL-1-mediated growth arrest. The action of IL-1 in A375-C6 cells has been documented to be mediated through specific cell surface receptors (25Endo Y. Matsushima K. Oppenheim J.J. Immunobiology. 1986; 172: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The binding of IL-1 to its receptor results in activation of a variety of second-messenger signaling pathways (reviewed in Ref. 13Joshi-Barve S.S. Rangnekar V.V. Sells S.F. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18018-18029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a unique primary gene expression program characterized by the induction of a composite set of immediate early genes such as gro-α,gro-β, c-jun,nur77/NGF1-B/NAK1,IRG-9/TIS11, and Egr-1 (16Rangnekar V.V.

Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1 action in A375-C6 cells is also characterized by inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis (18Yang D. Hayashi H. Hiyama Y. Takii T. Onozaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 26Endo Y. Matsushima K. Onozaki K. Oppenheim J.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2342-2348PubMed Google Scholar). Although these events are thought to mediate the antiproliferative effect of IL-1, further investigation is required to elucidate the direct mechanisms responsible for initiation and/or maintenance of the growth-arrested state. Since cell growth and proliferation are ultimately regulated by a highly conserved set of cell cycle-regulatory proteins, a fruitful approach to the study of the antiproliferative mode of action of IL-1 is to examine the influence of IL-1 on the regulation of the cell cycle-regulating machinery. The eukaryotic cell cycle is regulated by the action of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their activating subunits, the cyclins (27Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, 28Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Cdk6 and Cdk4 are associated with the D-type cyclins and regulate G1progression. Cdk2 is associated with E- and A-type cyclins, and the respective complexes are believed to control G1-S transition and S phase progression, respectively. Cdc2 is associated with B-type cyclins and regulates G2-M phase. The most well studied substrates of the CDKs operating during G1 and S phases are the retinoblastoma family of proteins (29Cobrinik D. Dowdy S.F. Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Weinberg R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 312-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30Hollingsworth R.E. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This family consists of pRb and the related proteins p107 and p130, collectively termed the pocket proteins. Progression from G1 to S requires inactivation of the retinoblastoma family proteins by phosphorylation and the consequent release of a number of factors including the E2F family of transcription factors. These transcription factors then activate transcription of various genes that promote cell cycle progression. Thus, the phosphorylation state of retinoblastoma family proteins is a critical determinant in the execution of the progression from G1 to S. Recently, Muthukkumar et al. (15Muthukkumar S. Sells S.F. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5733-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) documented that growth arrest by IL-1 was linked to suppression of pRb phosphorylation and suggested that hypophosphorylated pRb may possibly mediate the action of IL-1. Since pRb is phosphorylated by the action of the CDKs, it is conceivable that the IL-1-induced pRb hypophosphorylation is the result of negative regulation of the CDKs. However, the effect of IL-1 on the activity or the regulation of the CDKs has not been defined as yet. In mammalian cells, regulation of CDKs is achieved by several mechanisms including alteration of CDK levels; changes in the expression of the cyclins with which CDKs interact; activation and inactivation of CDKs by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events; and the abundance and action of two families of CDK inhibitors, the Cip/Kip family (p21cip1, p27kip1, and p57kip2) and the Ink4 family (p16ink4a, p15ink4b, p18ink4c, and p19ink4d) (reviewed in Refs. 27Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, 31Peter M. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1994; 79: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, and 32Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Modulation at any of these levels of regulation could regulate pRb phosphorylation. The current study was undertaken to investigate the molecular mechanisms, which mediate the antiproliferative effect of IL-1, through a detailed analysis of the IL-1 effects on the cell cycle-regulating molecules, such as CDKs, cyclins, CDK inhibitors, and pRb family proteins. By using A375S2 human melanoma cells (33Nakai S. Mizuno K. Kaneta M. Hirai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which are as highly sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of IL-1 as A375-C6 cells, we have systematically analyzed the changes that occur in kinase activities, expression levels, interactions, and phosphorylation status of the cell cycle-regulating molecules and compared them to the timing of onset and completion of the growth-arresting process. We conclude from these experiments that IL-1 arrests A375S2 cells at G1and G2 phases of the cell cycle by inhibiting kinase activities of cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin B1-Cdc2 complexes, and the inhibitory mechanism for each complex is different. Furthermore, data presented here suggest that IL-1 exerts its growth-arresting effects via p107 and p130 pathways rather than through pRb. A375S2 human melanoma cells (obtained from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Cellular Technology Institute, Tokushima, Japan) were cultured in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc. Oriental Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10‥ heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5‥ CO2. Human recombinant IL-1 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). To assure exponential cell growth, A375S2 cell cultures were set up 48 h prior to the addition of IL-1; 0.6 × 106cells were plated in 100-mm plastic dishes and incubated for 24 h, the culture medium was then replaced, and the incubation was continued for another 24 h before the addition of IL-1 (1.0 ng/ml, unless otherwise indicated). Cells were harvested at different times after the addition of IL-1 and processed for cyclin-dependent kinase assays, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, or Northern blotting, as described below. For the cell proliferation assay, cells at 1.2 × 105 per 60-mm dish were treated with IL-1 at different concentrations. At various experimental intervals, cells were trypsinized and counted using a cell counter (Sysmex model F-500, Sysmex Co., Kobe, Japan). In a parallel experiment, the number of viable cells was also determined by the Trypan blue dye exclusion test. For cell cycle analysis, trypsinized cells were stained with propidium iodide by using the Cycle TEST PLUS kit (Nippon Becton Dickinson Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed for DNA content by using the Becton Dickinson fluorescence-activated cell sorting system (FACSCalibur). Cell cycle distribution was determined using ModFit LT Software (Verity Software House, Popsham, ME). All experiments were repeated at least twice. Antibodies used and their sources were as follows: Cdk2 (M2), Cdk4 (C-22), Cdk6 (C-21), cyclin A (BF683 and H-432), cyclin B1 (H-433), cyclin D (HD11), cyclin E (HE111), p15 (K-18), p16 (C-20), p18 (N-20), p19 (M-167), p21 (C-19), p57 (C-20), p107 (C-18), and phosphotyrosine (PY99) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); cyclin A (14591A), Cdc2 (14391A), cyclin E (14591A), and p21 (15431E) from PharMingen (San Diego, CA); p27 (K25020) and p130 (R27020) from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); cyclin D (06–137) from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); p21 (Ab-1) and p53 (Ab-2) from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA); pRb C-terminal (9032) from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). The antibodies 15431E for p21, H-432 for cyclin A, HE111 for cyclin E, and HD11 for cyclin D were used only for immunoprecipitation. The antibody Ab-1 for p21 was used for immunodepletion. Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 0.1‥ Nonidet P-40, with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A added just before use). Cell lysates were sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, aliquots were removed for analysis of protein concentration (measured using the DC Protein Assay kit; Nippon Bio-Rad Laboratories, Osaka, Japan), and samples were adjusted to equivalent protein concentrations. After precleaning with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan), equal amounts of protein (150 μg) were incubated with the appropriate antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Antibody complexes were recovered on protein G-Sepharose beads and washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and twice with 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The beads were then incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in 25 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmglutathione, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) in the presence of either 2.5 μg of histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 1 μg of GST-pRb substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per reaction. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer, and samples were analyzed by 12.5‥ SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Lysis buffer and immunoprecipitation were as described above. Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved by 12.5‥ SDS-PAGE (7.5‥ in the case of pRb family proteins), the resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Nippon Bio-Rad Laboratories) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Nippon Bio-Rad Laboratories), and the membranes were blocked by incubating them overnight in TBST (Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) containing 5‥ nonfat dry milk and 0.05‥ Tween 20). The blots were then rinsed three times in TBST and incubated with primary antibody for 2 h. After a wash, the nitrocellulose was incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. Finally, the protein was visualized by ECL-based autoradiography as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Whole cell extracts were prepared with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and subjected to four rounds of immunodepletion, using either normal rabbit serum or a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against p21 (15431E; PharMingen) immobilized on protein G-Sepharose beads. Following depletion, supernatants were subjected to Western blot analysis as described above to show the presence of remaining proteins. Total cellular RNA was isolated by using RNAzol (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX), and RNA samples (10 μg) were fractionated by electrophoresis through 1.3‥ agarose gels containing 6‥ formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA and blotted onto a synthetic nylon membrane (Biodyne A; Pall BioSupport Corp., East Hills, NY) in 20× SSC (1× SSC: 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate) and baked at 80 °C for 2 h. The blots were prehybridized and then hybridized to a32P-labeled antisense RNA probe for human p21 at 65 °C. The probe was synthesized in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Riboprobe Gemini II system (Promega KK, Tokyo, Japan). As a template for the antisense RNA probe, the full-length cDNA of human p21 (kindly provided by Dr. A. Noda, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan) was used. The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC plus 0.1‥ SDS for 5 min and then twice in 0.1× SSC plus 0.1‥ SDS for 30 min at 65 °C and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C using an intensifying screen. After detection of p21 mRNA, the membranes were rehybridized with a32P-labeled antisense RNA probe for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydogenase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) to verify the equal loading of RNA. To determine the optimal IL-1 concentration to inhibit A375S2 cell proliferation completely, exponentially growing cells were treated with various concentrations of IL-1 for 96 h, and the total number of live cells was counted. As shown in Fig.1 A, more than 1 ng/ml of IL-1 inhibited the cell proliferation almost completely. A trypan blue dye exclusion test indicated little toxicity associated with this dose of IL-1 (>90‥ viability after 96 h). We therefore used 1 ng/ml IL-1 for subsequent experiments. Fig. 1 B shows the time course of the antiproliferative effect of IL-1 on A375S2 cells. A slight inhibition of cellular proliferation was apparent as early as 24 h after IL-1 treatment, and thereafter the proliferation was inhibited almost completely, indicating that the action of IL-1 was exerted rapidly. To further characterize the antiproliferative action of IL-1, an analysis of the distribution of cells in the various phases of the cell cycle was performed by flow cytometry as a function of time following IL-1 treatment (Fig. 2). No change in cell cycle distribution was apparent during the first 4 h following exposure to IL-1. A decrease in the percentage of cells in S phase was noticeable between 6 and 8 h. There was a remarkable decrease in the S-phase fraction after 24 h (to 3‥ or less) accompanied by an increase in the percentage of cells in both G1 and G2/M. By 48 h, the percentage of cells in S phase had decreased to <1‥. In microscopic analysis of Wright-Giemsa-stained cell preparations, no mitotic cell was observed after 48 h of IL-1 treatment (data not shown). These results showed that IL-1 arrested A375S2 cells at G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle. It was also shown that the process resulting in the blockage at two different cell cycle points began to take effect within the first 6–8 h and was nearly completed by 24 h following IL-1 treatment. We therefore focused on the mechanisms inhibiting cell cycle progression during the early phase (<6–8 h) of IL-1 treatment.Figure 2Changes in cell cycle phase distribution following IL-1 treatment. Exponentially growing A375S2 cells were treated at time 0 with 1.0 ng/ml IL-1. At intervals thereafter, cells were harvested and stained for DNA content, and the relative percentage of total cells in G1, S, and G2 + M phases of the cell cycle were determined. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments and are the mean values of duplicates for each time point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since CDKs complexed with their catalytic subunit cyclins regulate the cell cycle progression in different phases, we first investigated whether the IL-1-induced blockage at two different cell cycle points was associated with changes in the kinase activities of various cyclin-CDK complexes. Results of the in vitro kinase assays using appropriate immunoprecipitates and substrates (GST-pRb or histone H1) are shown in Fig. 3. Cdk6- and cyclin D-associated kinase activities both elevated from 2 to 4 h following IL-1 treatment, peaked at 6–8 h, and thereafter declined and fell below control levels at 24–48 h. Cdk4 was expressed at very low levels in all control and IL-1-treated A375S2 cells (see below), and no kinase activities could be detected in Cdk4 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). The levels of cyclin A-associated kinase activity did not change significantly during the first 8 h of IL-1 treatment, but most of the activity had disappeared after 24 h of treatment. The kinase activities associated with the other Cdks and cyclins we tested, namely Cdk2, Cdc2, cyclin E, and cyclin B, all decreased gradually from 4 to 8 h and almost disappeared by 24 h after IL-1 treatment. These results demonstrate that IL-1 treatment results in a temporary increase in cyclin D-Cdk6 activity and consistent decreases of cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin B1-Cdc2 activities. It should be noted that the decreases of cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin B1-Cdc2 activities were both already detectable after 4 h of IL-1 treatment, before any changes in cell cycle distribution could be detected (Fig. 2). The kinase activities of cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin B-Cdc2 are known to be critical for G1-S and G2-M transition, respectively. Hence, it is likely that down-regulation of cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin B1-Cdc2 activities from 4 h is a mechanism of braking the cell cycle at their respective points during the early phase of IL-1 treatment. We next examined whether the early changes in cyclin-CDK kinase activities are attributable to changes in the protein levels of cyclins and CDKs. Results of Western analysis are shown in Fig.4. IL-1 did not reduce the expression of any of the cyclins or CDKs for at least 8 h, indicating that the changes of cyclin D-CDK6, cyclin E-Cdk2, or cyclin B1-Cdc2 kinase activities observed in the early phase of IL-1 treatment (Fig. 3) were not due to changes in protein expression levels of the respective components. At 24 h, the expression of Cdk6 and cyclin D was decreased significantly. It was further decreased at 48 h. The expression of cyclin A, cyclin B1, and Cdc2 was also decreased markedly at 24 h, and these components had mostly disappeared at 48 h. The decreased expression of these components after 24 h may correspond to the decrease in the respective cyclin-CDK activities during the late phase of IL-1 treatment (Fig. 3). In contrast, the protein expression of Cdk2 and cyclin E remained unchanged up to 48 h despite the complete loss of cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity after 24 h of IL-1 treatment (Fig. 3). For Cdk2, however, a slower migrating form was observed to increase at 24 and 48 h. Since the form represents the Thr-160-dephosphorylated inactive form of Cdk2 (34Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), the increased dephosphorylation of Cdk2 was likely to contribute to the down-regulation of Cdk2-associated kinase activities after 24 h of IL-1 treatment. Cdk4 was expressed at very low levels in these cells with no detectable change in the expression following IL-1 treatment. Further experiments examined the possibility that altered association of cyclins with their CDK partners might contribute to the changes in cyclin-CDK kinase activities during the early phase of IL-1 treatment. In these experiments, cyclins were immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted for the respective CDK partners. As shown in Fig. 5, levels of cyclin D-associated Cdk6 elevated from 2 to 4 h following IL-1 treatment, peaked at 6–8 h, and thereafter declined. The changes in cyclin D-Cdk6 association were similar in timing and magnitude to the changes in cyclin D-Cdk6 kinase activity (Fig. 3), suggesting that the temporary increase of cyclin D-Cdk6 activity between 2 and 8 h reflected the increased formation of cyclin D-Cdk6 complex. On the other hand, no change was observed in levels of cyclin E-associated Cdk2 over the 48 h of treatment. Levels of cyclin A-associated Cdk2 and cyclin B1-associated Cdc2 were unaltered for the first 8 h following IL-1 treatment, but thereafter both declined to low levels at 24 h, paralleling the temporal changes in total protein levels of cyclin A, cyclin B1, and Cdc2 (Fig. 4). As described above, the early decreases in cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin B1-Cdc2 activities were not accompanied by decreases in the expression of respective cyclins or CDKs or by decreases in their complex formation (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Then, to investigate other possible causes of the decrease in kinase activities, the expression of various CDK inhibitors was examined by Western analysis. Data in Fig.6 show that IL-1 treatment resulted in a rapid induction of p21. The protein levels of p21 began to increase in the first 2 h of treatment and continued to increase up to 48 h. On the other hand, the protein levels of p27, which was expressed at very low levels in untreated A375S2 cells, remained unchanged during the early phase of IL-1 treatment, and an obvious increase was observed only after 24 h of treatment. The expression of other CDK inhibitors, p57, p15, p16, p18, and p19, was only detected at very low levels in cells that were untreated or treated with IL-1 (Fig. 6). To determine whether the increase of p21 protein expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, p21 mRNA was quantitated by Northern blot analysis using a full-length antisense RNA probe for human p21. As shown in Fig. 7, a small increase in p21 mRNA levels was detectable within 30 min of IL-1 treatment, and the levels continued to increase up to 48 h, paralleling the changes in p21 protein levels. These results indicated that the IL-1-induced increase in p21 protein levels is regulated transcriptionally at least in part. p21 expression is known to be under the control of both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. To examine whether p53 protein contributes to the IL-1-mediated induction of p21, the protein levels of p53 were analyzed after treatment of cells with IL-1. As shown in Fig. 7, p53 protein was barely detectable in normal growing A375S2 cells, and no change was observed in its expression levels following IL-1 treatment. On the other hand, when we treated A375S2 cells with camptothecin, a topoisomerase inhibitor that induces double-stranded DNA-breaks, we obser"

Linkers are required for the interaction of some membrane proteins such as AE1 (anion exchange 1 or band 3 protein) and Na,K-ATPase with skeleton components. The AE1 and Na,K-ATPase linker is ankyrin (4Nelson W.J. Veshnock P.J. Nature. 1987; 328: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 5Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Bradford A.L. Joe E.H. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. Saccomani G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C63-C70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously demonstrated the colocalization of ankyrin and H,K-ATPase in parietal cells and the coimmunoprecipitation of the gastric pump with exogenous erythrocyte ankyrin. This supports the idea that the gastric ATPase can bind ankyrin as its parent protein, the Na,K-ATPase, does. However, it is not known how ATPase and ankyrin interact and whether minor cellular components act as linkers. In this study, we demonstrate that the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase binds to ankyrin III. We map the binding site in the N-terminal (Nt)1 domain of ATPase on one hand and in the spectrin binding domain of ankyrin III on the other hand. The spectrin binding domain of the rabbit ankyrin III is cloned and has more than 90% identity with the analogous domains of the mouse and human ankyrin. Fragments of rabbit ATPase and rabbit ankyrin III were both expressed to test the specificity of the interaction by coimmunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography. Stomachs were collected from Nembutal-injected rabbits. Gastric fundic mucosa was scrapped and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were sent toCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. for preparation of the cDNA bank with (dT) and random oligomers to limit the overexpression of 3′ extremities of mRNA. cDNA were ligated in the prey plasmid pGAD 10 usingEcoRI adaptors and incorporated in DH5α Escherichia coli strain by efficiency transformation. The library had about 1.7 million independent clones, of which 30% were empty. The DNA fragment for the first 98 residues of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase was obtained by PCR from the complete cDNA. The PCR conditions were as follows: (i) denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min; (ii) 35 cycles each consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs); and (iii) a final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product with the expected size of 320 base pairs was digested with BamHI and SalI and purified on a 4% agarose gel with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. It was inserted in theBamHI/SalI site of the pFBL23 plasmid (a gift of J. Camonis, Institut Curie, Paris, France), and the product was sequenced (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). Yeast strain HF7c (a donation of J. Camonis, Institut Curie, Paris, France) was transformed to Trp prototrophy with pFBL23-Nt using the lithium acetate method (8Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). The resulting strain was further transformed to Trp, Leu, His prototrophy with the pGAD10 library plasmid. The transformation mix (100 μl) was plated on a 10-cm Petri dish and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. Aliquots of each mix were taken before plating and used to determine the transformation efficiency on Trp- and Leu-free medium. His+ colonies were screened for β-galactosidase activity using the filter assay method. Positively transformed colonies eliciting 50-unit absorbance at 600 nm were blotted onto Whatman 3MM paper. The filter was frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at room temperature. The freeze-thaw cycle was repeated three times. The filter was soaked in 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 containing 2 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and then incubated overnight at 37 °C. The clones expressing the β−galactosidase were selected only when the Lex A DNA binding domain-Nt fusion was present. Plasmids were extracted and recovered by electroporation in the leu− E. coli strain 1066 (a gift of C. Cullin, Center Génétique Moléculaire, CNRS, Gif sur Yvette, France). The plasmids were then used to transform the HF7c strain alone or with pFBL23 in the presence of Nt or a control protein (laminin, hydrophobic protein). The clones expressing the Nt of H,K-ATPase were selected when they were positive for Trp, Leu, His prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity. The plasmids were sequenced (Genome Express). Yeast extracts were prepared from liquid cultures in SD-Trp-Leu-His medium (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). Cultures were grown to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.8. The yeast extracts were centrifuged (5,000 × gfor 5 min), and the pellets were washed in 50 mmNa2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8. The yeast extracts were lysed by vortexing with glass beads (reference number 854 170/1, Braun Biotech International). Cell debris was discarded by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 20 min), and the supernatants were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C in the presence of 10 μg of the anti-Nt H,K-ATPase antibody (95A3). Then, 10 μg of IgG2 against mouse IgG were added and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The DNA sequence encoding for the Nt (amino acids 1–98) was obtained from the complete cDNA of rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase cloned in Bluescript vector by PCR amplification. The PCR conditions were the same as for the bait plasmid. The final product of 320 base pairs was digested withNcoI and BglII and purified on a 4% agarose gel with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) using the manufacturer's instructions. This cDNA was inserted between the restriction sitesNcoI and BglII of the prokaryotic expression vector pQE 60 (Qiagen) to generate a plasmid encoding for an in-frame fusion protein composed of Nt and 6 histidines in the C-terminal extremity. The plasmid with the insert was checked by sequencing (Genome Express). JS 238 E. coli strain (a gift of O. Fayet, Laboratoire de Microbiologie et Génétique Moléculaire, Toulouse, France) overexpressing the lactose operon repressor (Lac lq mutation) was transformed by the CaCl2 method with pQE 60 containing the Nt of the ATPase. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg of ampicillin until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.8 units. Expression of the fusion protein was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were harvested at 4 °C by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min. Pellets were suspended in 50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8 in the presence of the protease inhibitor mixture (P 8215, Sigma). Bacteria were lysed by sonication (14 μm for 1 min) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitations and affinity chromatographies. The DNA sequence encoding for the spectrin binding domain (SBD) was obtained by the PCR amplification of a clone isolated by the two-hybrid screening. The PCR conditions were as follows: (i) denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min; (ii) 35 cycles each consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min with the Pfu polymerase (reference number 60025251, Stratagene); and (iii) a final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product of 1850 base pairs was digested with BamHI and Bsu36I and purified on a 1% agarose gel with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) using the manufacturer's protocol. Then the full cDNA was inserted between theBamHI/Bsu36I restriction sites of the yeast expression vector pYeF2 2A (a gift of Center Génétique Moléculaire, CNRS, Gif sur Yvette, France) to generate a plasmid encoding for the SBD under the dependence of a galactose-inducible promoter (pGAL10-CYC1) with an adenine selection marker. The plasmid with insert was sequenced (Genome Express). Expression was performed in yeast strain BMA 64 (a donation of Center Génétique Moléculaire, CNRS, Gif sur Yvette, France). Yeast were grown at 30 °C overnight in a 100-ml flask containing 25 ml of WO medium (yeast nitrogen base (Life Technologies, Inc. 25685–033), 1.43 g/liter; ammonium sulfate, 5 g/liter; galactose, 20 g/liter) complemented with 20 μg/ml uracil, 20 μg/ml tryptophan, 100 μg/ml leucine, and 10 μg/ml histidine. The following day, 250 ml of the same medium were seeded and incubated at 30 °C up to the absorbance at 600 nm of 0.8. Yeast were pelleted by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 10 min), suspended in 2 ml of sonication buffer with 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (P 8215, Sigma), and then broken by vigorous vortexing with glass beads (854 170/1, Braun Biotech International). Cell debris were discarded by centrifugation at 4 °C (15,000 × g for 10 min). Four mixtures were prepared and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. These mixtures were as follows: (i) 100 μl of bacterial extract containing the Nt plus 2 ml of yeast extract containing the SBD; (ii) 100 μl of bacterial extract containing the Nt plus 2 ml of yeast extract without the SBD; (iii) 100 μl of bacterial extract without the Nt plus 2 ml of yeast extract containing the SBD; and (iv) 100 μl of bacterial extract without the Nt plus 2 ml of yeast extract without the SBD. Ten μg of 95A3 were added and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Then, 10 μg of IgG2 anti-mouse IgG were added for 4 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose by electro-elution, and analyzed. Four columns of 500 μl of nickel resins (superflow, Qiagen) were prepared and equilibrated with 50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8. In columns A and B, 10 ml of the bacterial extract containing the Nt domain of the ATPase were poured. In C and D, 10 ml of the bacterial extract free of the Nt domain of ATPase were poured. All columns were washed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Three liters of a yeast culture containing the SBD fragment of ankyrin were poured in columns A and C, and 3 liters of the same culture medium free of SBD were poured in columns B and D. All columns were rinsed with 50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8 and eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The four eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots. Nitrocellulose sheets were incubated in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in the presence of antibodies, either the 95A3 mouse IgG monoclonal antibody against the Nt of the H,K-ATPase or the rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody against the SBD of ankyrin III (a gift of K. Kordeli, Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, Institut J. Monod, Faculté de Jussieu, Paris, France). For staining, secondary species antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used, and the stain was revealed with the Pierce chemiluminescence kit (reference number 34080, Pierce) using the manufacturer's protocol. Seven million gastric cDNA clones were screened against the Nt fragment of the H,K-ATPase by the two-hybrid assays; 7 million is four times the amount of independent clones of the cDNA bank and should thus be statistically sufficient to screen all the different cDNA fragments. Selected were 144 positive clones, which amount to 20 positive clones per million. Five clones had more than 90% identity. Three were identical (1,791 base pairs) and corresponded to 597 aa. The two others were shorter and overlapped the previous sequence on 498 aa (1,494 base pairs). Those fragments have a high identity (>96%) with the “membrane domain” of the human and mouse ankyrin III from Arg-835 to Ser-873 and with the major part of the spectrin binding domain going from Glu-874 to Leu-1455 (9Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A. Yialamas M. Turtzo L.C. Otsuka A.J. Lux S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). By looking for a protein interacting with the N-terminal domain of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase, we selected the membrane and spectrin binding domains of the rabbit ankyrin III. The sequence shows little variation between the human and mouse ankyrin III sequences (Fig.1). To check whether the activation of the reporter genes of the two-hybrid assay is the consequence of a specific interaction between the N-terminal domain of the ATPase and the ankyrin fragment, we first tested whether the Nt domain (expressed as Lex A DNA binding domain-Nt) and the SBD domain (expressed as SBD-gal4-activating domain) can coprecipitate when they are incubated in the presence of a specific anti-ATPase antibody. Both proteins are recovered in the same precipitate (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 4). This precipitate is absent when the extracts of the bait Lex A DNA binding domain-Nt cotransfected with gal4-activating domain (SBD-free) and of the prey SBD-gal4-activating domain cotransfected with Lex A DNA binding domain (Nt of ATPase-free) are used. This absence indicates that the immunoreaction is specific. Thus the activation of the reporter gene of the two-hybrid assays is due to the direct interaction of the Nt domain of the gastric ATPase with the ankyrin fragment. To corroborate the previous conclusions, both proteins were expressed in the absence of their fusion partners: the activating and binding domains. The SBD (597 aa) was expressed in yeast, and the Nt of the ATPase (98 aa) was expressed in E. coli. After mixing the yeast and E. coli extracts, the Nt anti-ATPase antibody (95A3) was added. Precipitation was induced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The SBD of ankyrin was recovered in the ATPase precipitate (Fig. 3, lanes 1and 2). If the ATPase is absent, the ankyrin fragment is not precipitated, which implicates that the coprecipitation requires a specific interaction (Fig. 3, lanes 3–6). To further check the specificity of the interaction, we tested whether the Nt-SBD complex was recovered by affinity chromatography on nickel resin (Fig.4). In two columns (A and B), we poured the bacterial extract containing the Nt fragment of the ATPase tagged with 6 histidines (Fig. 4, a and b, lane 4). In two other columns (C and D) we poured the bacterial extract free of the ATPase fragment (Fig. 4 c, lane 4; result not shown for column D, because no protein was eluted from this column). Then, different yeast extracts were added. Those containing the ankyrin fragment (Fig. 4, a and c, lane 3) were loaded on columns A and C, and those free of the ankyrin fragment (Fig. 4 b, lane 3 and unshown result (column D)) were loaded on columns B and D. All columns were then rinsed and eluted. The presence of the Nt fragment of the ATPase and of the SBD fragment of ankyrin in the elution was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and by Western blots. The fractions eluted from column A contain both proteins (Fig.4 a, lanes 1 and 2). Similar bands are absent from the elution of column C (Fig. 4 c, lanes 1 and 2) and of column D (result not shown). Therefore, the Nt domain of the ATPase binds to the nickel resin and is able to hold back the SBD fragment. Moreover, the Western blot of the fractions loaded on, and eluted from, columns B, C, and D (Fig. 4, band c; results from column D are not shown) argue for the specificity of the interaction because, in the absence of the Nt, of the SBD, or of both fragments, no immunoreactive protein is held back on the columns, as revealed by the antibodies. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction between ATPase and ankyrin fragments is specific. The Nt domain of the gastric ATPase and the SBD of rabbit ankyrin III are responsible for this interaction. Because the Nt and SBD fragments are the only proteins recovered by affinity chromatography, we further conclude that the interaction is direct and does not require a third partner (Fig.5). Looking for cytoplasm partners of the N-terminal domain of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase, we screened a cDNA bank of rabbit fundic mucosa by two-hybrid assays. We identified the SBD of rabbit ankyrin III. Previous studies strongly suggested an interaction between the H,K-ATPase and an ankyrin. Smith et al. (7Smith P.R. Bradford A.L. Joe E.H. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. Saccomani G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C63-C70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence and by confocal microscopy on isolated gastric glands that the H,K-ATPase colocalized with ankyrin in resting and stimulated parietal cells. In the resting cells, the distribution of both proteins is diffuse in the cytoplasm, whereas after stimulation, they are both located at the apical membrane. In the same work, Smith et al. (7Smith P.R. Bradford A.L. Joe E.H. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. Saccomani G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C63-C70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that exogenous erythrocyte ankyrin coimmunoprecipitates with the parietal cell microsomes. Because the main protein of gastric microsomes is the proton pump, this H,K-ATPase was a good candidate for an interaction with ankyrin. In this work we make the first direct demonstration that the ankyrin III and the H,K-ATPase interact and that their interaction does not require a third partner. Moreover, we demonstrate that the 80 residues of the N terminus of the α subunit of the gastric H,K-ATPase bind to a fragment of ankyrin that contains the spectrin binding domain of ankyrin. It has been demonstrated that the Na,K-ATPase and ankyrin interact by way of several sites (10Devarajan P. Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The ATPase sites were mapped on the second (aa 140–290) and catalytic (aa 345–784) loops of the α subunit. It was further demonstrated that the ATPase interacts with the repeat domain (89 kDa) and the SBD of ankyrin (10Devarajan P. Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The existence of at least two sites explains the high affinity (K d, 25 nm) of the complex, and the destruction of one site decreases the affinity constant by 20-fold (5Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17252-17256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gastric H,K-ATPase and the Na,K-ATPase are two homologous ionic pumps. They have a similar structure, with two subunits sharing a high degree of sequence identity (60–65% on the whole sequence). Homology is high, especially in the domains carrying the ankyrin Na,K-ATPase interaction sites. Therefore, the gastric H,K-ATPase could have ankyrin binding sites on the second loop (aa 155–300) and/or the catalytic domain (aa 357–777). Indeed, the catalytic domain of the H,K-ATPase has a 19-residue fragment conserved in the Na,K-ATPase and in the band 3 protein also. This fragment has been identified as an ankyrin binding site (11Jordan C. Puschel B. Koob R. Drenckhahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29971-29975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By two-hybrid assays, we tested whether loop II and the catalytic domain of the gastric ATPase interact with the SBD of ankyrin III. The ATPase fragments (residues Gln-161 to Thr-293 for loop II and Thr-357 to Arg-777 for the catalytic loop) failed to interact with the SBD. Two explanations can be offered. Either none of those H,K-ATPase domains binds to the SBD of ankyrin III, or the two-hybrid assays are inefficient. The latter hypothesis cannot be ruled out because, if the N-terminal of the ATPase is short and polar and thus has a good probability to be expressed as a native fold, loop II and the catalytic domain are longer and more hydrophobic. The expression of hydrophobic fragments often leads to inclusion bodies because the native fold is not reached. 2F. Festy, J.-C. Robert, R. Brasseur, and A. Thomas, unpublished data. Lastly, it could be argued that this part of the H,K-ATPase binds to other domains of ankyrin (repeat domain, regulatory domain) that we did not use in our assays. The N-terminal domain of the H,K-ATPase and the spectrin binding domain of ankyrin interact. This interaction is specific to the gastric pump, because the N terminus of the Na,K-ATPase does not interact. Actually, no interaction of the N terminus of the Na,K-ATPase was detected when the whole ankyrin III was used. The N-terminal fragments of both ionic pumps are the most different parts of their sequences. This could indicate different functions. The N terminus of the H,K-ATPase could be a regulating element in the activation of parietal cells by acting in the translocation of the pump to the apical membrane. Indeed, this phenomenon is specific to the H,K-ATPase. It relies upon the recruitment of the gastric parietal cell skeleton by as yet unclear mechanisms. Ankyrin III could be a piece of the puzzle.

The longer isoform contains a fibronectin type III (F3) domain at its N terminus, whereas the shorter isoform is lacking this domain.

Collagen XIV interacts with a broad palette of extracellular matrix molecules and a few of these interactions have been assigned to a particular domain of the polypeptide chain. Collagen XIV binds to collagen VI (9Brown J.C. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This interaction seems to be accomplished by the collagenous domain, because the triple helices of collagens VI and XIV have about the same length, allowing a lateral aggregation. Collagen XIV binds to procollagen N-proteinase (14Colige A. Beschin A. Samyn B. Goebels Y. van Beeumen J. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16724-16730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this way the proteinase is immobilized in close vicinity to type I collagen fibrils, where it could control the processing and incorporation of newly synthesized molecules. Collagen XIV also interacts with glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans (9Brown J.C. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Two binding sites have been described for heparin, one in the C-terminal NC1 domain and one at the opposite end in the N-terminal NC3 domain. Although the interaction with the NC1 domain has been characterized in great detail (15Giry-Lozinguez C. Aubert-Foucher E. Penin F. Deléage G. Dublet B. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Montserret R. Aubert-Foucher E. McLeish M.J. Hill J.M. Ficheux D. Jaquinod M. van der Rest M. Deléage G. Penin F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6479-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), not much is known about the interaction with the NC3 domain except that it is facilitated by a stretch of basic amino acids located between the first F3 repeat and the adjacent VA domain (17Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Collagen XIV also interacts with the small proteoglycan decorin (18Font B. Aubert-Foucher E. Goldschmidt D. Eichenberger D. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25015-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. Kresse H. Schuppan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20414-20419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and it is likely that the two binding sites identified for heparin are also involved in this interaction. Collagen XIV has the potential to bind to cell surfaces. In vitro, it promotes the adhesion of various mesenchymal and epithelial cells to plastic dishes. For human fibroblasts, a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate form of CD44 has been proposed as a cell surface receptor (20Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. von Lampe B. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Another study demonstrated adhesion of hematopoietic cells to collagen XIV and suggested a heparan sulfate proteoglycan as cell surface receptor (21Klein G. Kibler C. Schermutzki F. Brown J. Müller C.A. Timpl R. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast to these reports, an earlier study did not find any interaction between collagen XIV and nine different cell lines (9Brown J.C. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The apparent discrepancies between different reports about the interaction of collagen XIV with cells might be explained, at least in part, by the existence of different protein isoforms. Several isoforms that are likely to be generated by alternative splicing have been described for chicken collagen XIV. We reported the existence of two splice variants that possess distinct C-terminal domains (4Wälchli C. Trueb J. Kessler B. Winterhalter K.H. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These variants differ by the inclusion or skipping of 93 nucleotides encoding 31 amino acids of the NC1 domain. Another splice variant concerns the sixth F3 repeat in the center of chicken collagen XIV. This F3 repeat either contains or lacks an insert of the three amino acids Val-Arg-Thr (22Imhof M. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Two additional transcripts with alternative 5′-regions have been identified by Gerecke et al. (11Gerecke D.R. Foley J.W. Castagnola P. Gennari M. Dublet B. Cancedda R. Linsenmayer T.F. van der Rest M. Olsen B.R. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12177-12184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because these transcripts differ only in the 5′-untranslated region, they encode the same polypeptide. A striking variation is also observed at the N terminus of the two sequences published for chicken collagen XIV. Compared with our cDNA sequence (4Wälchli C. Trueb J. Kessler B. Winterhalter K.H. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the sequence reported by Gerecke et al. (11Gerecke D.R. Foley J.W. Castagnola P. Gennari M. Dublet B. Cancedda R. Linsenmayer T.F. van der Rest M. Olsen B.R. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12177-12184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) lacks a portion of ∼350 bp coding for an F3 domain. So far it is not known whether this difference is simply a cloning artifact or whether it occurs under physiological conditions. We therefore set out to investigate whether the two variants are the result of alternative splicing and whether the encoded polypeptides have distinct biological properties. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from various embryonic and adult chicken tissues by the guanidinium thiocyanate method as described previously (22Imhof M. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The RNA was transcribed into cDNA with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and primer P1 (see Table I). The single-stranded cDNA was amplified by PCR through 36 cycles of 1′ at 95 °C, 2′ at 50 °C and 3′ at 72 °C using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and primers P2 and P3. The products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Bands of interest were subcloned into the plasmid pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) employing theXbaI restriction site of the forward primer P2 and the internal EcoRI site of the PCR product (position 1283 according to Ref. 4Wälchli C. Trueb J. Kessler B. Winterhalter K.H. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

Such changes were introduced into the primers to create additional restrictions sites, to mutate the codons for individual amino acids, or to enable annealing to a vector sequence. The cDNA sequences coding for the domains F3, VA, F3+VA, as well as the fifth and eighth F3 domain of chicken collagen XIV were amplified by PCR using 1 ng of template and a pair of strand-specific primers as outlined in Table I. The reaction products were subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-5X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the desired reading frame downstream of the GST gene. For this purpose, suitable restriction sites had been introduced into the PCR primers. Orientation and reading frame of the final products were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were transfected into competent host cells (Escherichia coliBL21) and expressed after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as suggested by the supplier of the GST gene fusion system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bacteria were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. Fusion proteins were purified from the lysates by affinity chromatography on GSH-Sepharose. If required, the GST moiety was released from the fusion protein by cleavage with endopeptidase factor Xa (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and removed by adsorption to GSH-Sepharose. Purity and size of the expressed proteins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207112) Google Scholar). For particularly small proteins, Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used (24Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10472) Google Scholar). After transfer to nitrocellulose by electroblotting, the proteins were detected with the GST detection module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using goat anti-GST antibodies, followed by alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma Chemical Co.). The color reaction was performed with bromochloroindolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium substrate. The codons for individual amino acids of the first F3 domain were mutated by the ExSite PCR-based mutagenesis method (Stratagene). The forward primer harbored the desired mutation, while the reverse primer was phosphorylated at its 5′-end and selected in a way that it annealed directly adjacent to the 5′-end of the forward primer (Table I). To improve the efficiency of amplification, the template cDNA was cloned into pBluescript SK+ and all mutations were performed in this relatively small plasmid. After amplification through 21 cycles of 1′ at 95 °C, 2′ at the optimal annealing temperature of the primer pair used (54–62 °C), and 8′ at 72 °C, the maternal DNA was removed by digestion with the restriction enzyme DpnI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The ends of the linear products were joined by ligation with T4 DNA ligase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the circular, nicked plasmids were transfected into competent bacteria (E. coli XL-1 blue). Authenticity and reading frame of all mutated clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Finally, the inserts with the desired mutation were subcloned into theEcoRI/XhoI site of the expression vector pGEX-5X and expressed in E. coli BL21 as described above. Cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA): U266 (TIB-196), U937 (CRL-1593.2), KG-1a (CCL-246.1), HT1080 (CCL-121). Primary chicken fibroblasts (CTF) and primary chicken smooth muscle cells (CSM) were prepared from tendons and gizzards of 17-day-old chicken embryos with the help of collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (25Willimann T.E. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 332-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All hematopoietic cells (U266, U937, KG-1a) were cultivated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All adhesive cells (HT1080, CTF, CSM) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the same supplements. Two different assays were used to determine the cell binding activity of GST fusion proteins. For the method of Klein et al. (21Klein G. Kibler C. Schermutzki F. Brown J. Müller C.A. Timpl R. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), water droplets (5 μl) containing 10 pmol of fusion protein were spotted onto virgin plastic plates (Falcon 1007, 60-mm diameter) and air-dried. Residual binding sites of the plates were blocked with bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml in RPMI 1640 medium). Cells were seeded onto the washed plates (107 cells/plate) and allowed to attach for 1 h at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed by three gentle washing steps with phosphate-buffered saline, and adherent cells were inspected under the microscope. For the second method described by Ehnis et al. (20Ehnis T. Dieterich W. Bauer M. von Lampe B. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate were coated with fusion proteins (1 μg/100 μl) for 4 h at 37 °C. Remaining sites were blocked with bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml in RPMI 1640 medium). Approximately 105 cells in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium were added to each well and, after an incubation period of 1 h at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were washed off with RPMI 1640 medium. The wells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C with 50 μl of a solution containing 3.75 mm p-nitrophenol-N-acetyl-β-d-glucoseaminide, 50 mm sodium citrate, 0.25% Triton X-100, pH 5. After 40–90 min, depending on the cell line used, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 50 mm glycine, 5 mm EDTA, pH 10.4, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. In some experiments the coated plastic plates were incubated with various glycosaminoglycans (0.01–100 μg/ml, heparin, heparan sulfate, and decorin from Sigma; chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid from Fluka) prior to the addition of cells. The three-dimensional structure of several F3 domains was modeled with the help of a computer using the Swiss-Model Version 1.1 program (26Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The tenth F3 domain of fibronectin was used as template (27Main A.L. Harvey T.S. Baron M. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Homology modeling, superposition and energy minimization were done as previously described (22Imhof M. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The circular dichroism spectrum of purified F3 domains was recorded over a range of 190–250 nm in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (10 μg/100 μl). For fluorescence measurements, the proteins (5 μg/ml) were analyzed in a luminescence spectrometer set at 280-nm excitation and 290- to 400-nm emission. These experiments were kindly performed by Drs. T. Kiefhaber and O. Bieri (University of Basel). Two different full-length constructs were prepared using the original cDNA clones 113, 8, and 9 (3Trueb J. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Wälchli C. Trueb J. Kessler B. Winterhalter K.H. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as well as the two XbaI/EcoRI fragments that either contain or lack the sequence of the first F3 domain as outlined above (RT-PCR). The final constructs harbored the following fragments in pcDNA3.1(−): XbaI/EcoRI (positions 286–1283) derived from the two RT-PCR products;EcoRI/BstEII (positions 1283–2655) from clone 113; BstEII/PstI (positions 2655–4944) from clone 9; PstI/EcoRI (linker) (positions 4944–6558) from clone 8D. The sequences of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing with the help of several synthetic primers. The two constructs were expressed in a coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) following the instructions of the manufacturer. A typical reaction (total volume, 25 μl) contained 12.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 1 μl of TnT reaction buffer, 0.5 μl of T7 RNA polymerase (15 units/ml), 0.5 μl of amino acid mix (1 mm), 2 μl of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml), 0.5 μl of RNAsin (40,000 units/ml), and 2 μg of template DNA. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, the reaction mixture was analyzed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Bacterially expressed fusion proteins as well as in vitro translated full-length constructs were tested for their interaction with heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The protein solutions (100 μg of fusion protein or 75 μl of translation mixture) were applied at room temperature to the equilibrated column (bed volume 500 μl) and eluted stepwise with Tris buffer containing 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mm NaCl. The NaCl concentration of the effluent was determined with a CDM3 conductivity meter (Radiometer, Copenhagen), and the radioactivity was monitored with a Tri-Carb liquid scintillation counter (Canberra Packard). Proteins in the effluent were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were either processed for immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies or dried and exposed to Kodak MR x-ray film (Rochester, NY). Comparison of the two cDNA sequences available for chicken collagen XIV revealed a striking difference at the 5′-end. The sequence of Wälchli et al. (4Wälchli C. Trueb J. Kessler B. Winterhalter K.H. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) contained a segment of 348 bp inserted after the sequence corresponding to the signal peptide (Fig.1). This segment coded for 116 amino acids forming an F3 domain and a short linker. In the sequence of Gerecke et al. (11Gerecke D.R. Foley J.W. Castagnola P. Gennari M. Dublet B. Cancedda R. Linsenmayer T.F. van der Rest M. Olsen B.R. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12177-12184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) this insert was missing and the region of the signal peptide was directly followed by the VA domain. Because the inserted segment corresponded to a complete protein module and the reading frame was maintained, it seemed likely that the two forms were generated by an alternative splicing event. We therefore analyzed the exon/intron structure of the collagen XIV gene at this region. So far the chicken gene has not yet been isolated and characterized, but the human gene has been sequenced to a great extent in the course of the human genome project. We therefore analyzed the exon/intron structure of the human gene. This gene is located on chromosomal band 8q23 (28Imhof M. Trueb B. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 84: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), which is covered to a large extent by a BAC clone (GenBank™ accession number AC020603) and by several GSS tags (GenBank™ accession numbers AQ308761, AQ466836, andAQ700646). The unrefined sequences of these clones demonstrated that the first F3 domain is encoded by two separate exons that are followed by a short exon for the linker and by four exons for the VA domain (Fig. 1 C and Table II). All splice boundaries conform to the ag/gt rule. The 348-bp insert exactly spans exons 2, 3, and 4, lending strong support to the notion that the two isoforms are the result of alternative splicing. All introns in this region of the gene have a length of 1–4 kb, except for the intron separating exons 4 and 5. This intron is nearly 30 kb and may contain regulatory sequences required for alternative splicing.Table IIExon/intron structure of the human COL14A1 geneNo.Acceptor siteDonor siteExonIntronDomain2-aaa, amino acids.bpbpaa1CAAGGTCAAGND2-bND, not determined.NDSignalGlnGlyGlnV(2213)2TGGCTCCACC …CCAACTTCAG gtaaaa117∼1700F3alAlaProPr …ProThrSerG(39)3tttattatag GTGGAAAAAC …CAATTCAGAA gtacgt144NDF3lyGlyLysTh …GlnPheArgI(48)4tttcttccag TTAAAGATTT …TCACCAGAAG gtcaga8728539LinkleLysAspLe …SerProGluG(29)5tgctttgcag AAGTGAAATT …ACACGAATTG gtataa156864VAluValLysPe …ThrArgIleG(52)6ttttttccag GTCTTGCACA …ACACTAACAG gtatgt1201471VAlyLeuAlaGl …ThrLeuThrG(40)7tttctccaag GTCTTGCTTT …TTTGCCATAG gtatgt1654142VAlyLeuAlaLe …PheAlaIleG(55)8tctgtgtaag GGGTGAAAAA …GAAATTAAAG gtaaaa1623072VAlyValLysAs …GluIleLysA(54)9tttaatttag CCTCAGCCCA …ACCAGACGAG gtaata1521137F3laSerAlaHi …sProAspGlu(5023)10ctttaaacag GTGGTGGTAG …GAAACTACAC gtatgt1301394F3ValValValA …GluThrThrL(4313)2-a aa, amino acids.2-b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab In an effort to verify these results for the chicken collagen XIV gene, genomic PCR was performed utilizing exon specific primers and genomic DNA from chicken fibroblasts (not shown). Introns 2 and 3 were successfully amplified, and their DNA sequences confirmed the location of the splice boundaries deduced from the human gene. Intron 4, however, could not be amplified, suggesting that this intron must also be extremely large in the chicken gene. The expression of the two isoforms was studied by PCR using cDNA transcribed from poly(A) RNA of various chicken tissues. The forward primer corresponded to a sequence immediately preceding the signal peptide, the reverse primer corresponded to a sequence within the second F3 repeat (see Fig. 1). A PCR product of 1115 bp was expected for the longer splice variant, whereas a product of 767 bp was expected for the shorter splice variant lacking the F3 domain and the linker. A prominent band of ∼1100 bp indicative of the longer variant was obtained with RNA from eight different embryonic tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, gizzard, skin, liver, brain, sternum, and calvaria (Fig.2, left). Most of the samples also contained a band of ∼800 bp indicative of the shorter splice variant. However, the intensity of this band was considerably weaker and varied among the samples investigated. It was prominent in the sample from brain but barely detectable in the samples from sternum and calvaria. For a detailed analysis, the two PCR products were subcloned and sequenced. The sequence of the larger band was identical with that published by Wälchli et al"

When readdition of IL-3 stimulated cell proliferation, p21WAF-1 was inactivated as a CDKI despite maintenance of elevated protein level. p21WAF-1 was also up-regulated yet was nonfunctional as a CDKI when v-Abl PTK was activated in cells maintained in IL-3, but this occurred without increased p21WAF-1 transcription. Using a C-terminal epitope-specific p21WAF-1 antibody, v-Abl PTK-mediated increase in p21WAF-1 could be detected in intact cells only in the presence of IL-3. This indicated different binding partners of p21WAF-1 and/or protein conformation in nondividing or proliferating cells, respectively. The binding of CDK2, CDK4, or proliferating cell nuclear antigen to p21WAF-1 and its subcellular localization were unchanged in the presence or absence of IL-3. However, two-dimensional analysis revealed different forms of up-regulated p21WAF-1 in IL-3-deprived, nondividing cells compared with IL-3-stimulated proliferating cells. These data demonstrate that elevation of the CDKI p21WAF-1 is not always sufficient for cell cycle arrest and indicate an IL-3-sensitive pathway for the inactivation of p21WAF-1 function as a CDKI. v-Abl protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) promotes cell survival without cell proliferation in interleukin (IL)-3-deprived IC.DP premast cells (1Evans C.A.

These data demonstrate that elevation of the CDKI p21WAF-1 is not always sufficient for cell cycle arrest and indicate an IL-3-sensitive pathway for the inactivation of p21WAF-1 function as a CDKI. cyclin-dependent kinase CDK inhibitor proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein-tyrosine kinase interleukin bromodeoxyuridine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid One mechanism by which cell cycle progression is regulated is via the balance between cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 activation and inhibition (2Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). The CDK inhibitor (CDKI) p21WAF-1, the prototype of the Cip/Kip family of CDKIs, was initially identified in a coimmunoprecipitate with cyclin D (3Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 4El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W.

Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5249) Google Scholar), incorporating PCNA into a quaternary complex (3Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) and thereby regulating the cell cycle machinery. Initial observations by Xiong et al. (6Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar) described the primary role for p21WAF-1 as an inhibitor of CDK activity. However, subsequent investigations suggested that p21WAF-1 may also function to assemble specifically CDK4-cyclin D complexes and to target them to the nucleus (7LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). This has recently been substantiated in murine fibroblasts lacking p21WAF-1, wherein CDK4 and cyclin D cannot associate (8Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The generally accepted theory surrounding p21WAF-1 function therefore suggests that p21WAF-1 is involved in the assembly of CDK4 complexes but inhibits the activity of CDK2. However, p21WAF-1 nullizygous mice are developmentally normal (9Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar) and display normal CDK4 activity, thereby questioning the physiological role for p21WAF-1 in the assembly specifically of CDK4. The putative C-terminal nuclear localization signal in p21WAF-1 may help target the quaternary complex to the nucleus where it may exert its effect on CDKs. At the onset of mitosis, p21WAF-1 up-regulation caused the nuclear accumulation of CDK4 associated with cyclins A and B1 (10Dulic V. Stein G.H. Far D.F. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 546-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p21WAF-1 also directs PCNA to the replicative machinery of the cell (11Cayrol C. Knibiehler M. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and cell cycle arrest caused by p21WAF-1 involves inhibition of PCNA function(s). p21WAF-1 is required for cell cycle arrest at G1 phase of the cell cycle; HCT116 colon carcinoma cells containing wild-type p21WAF-1 undergo growth arrest after DNA damage, whereas their p21WAF-1 null counterparts do not (12Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Volgelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Moreover, cells derived from p21WAF-1 null mice have defective G1 checkpoints (9Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). p21WAF-1 also functions at other phases of the cell cycle. During S phase p21WAF-1 prevented replication of DNA possibly because of the inhibitory effect on PCNA (11Cayrol C. Knibiehler M. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) or because of p21WAF-1mediated inhibition of CDK activity (14Ogryzko V.Y. Wong P. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). p21WAF-1overexpression was linked with G1 and G2 arrest and prevented entry into S phase, although no delay in S phase progression was observed (15Medema R.H. Klompmaker R. Smits V.A.J. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Conversely, down-regulation of p21WAF-1 allowed DNA synthesis and entry into mitosis, thereby reversing growth arrest (16Nakanishi N. Adami G.R. Robetorye R.S. Noda A. Venable S.F. Dimitrov D. Pererira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4352-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We noted previously that the activation of a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Abl protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK), a leukemogenic oncogene promoted cell survival without cell proliferation after the withdrawal of IL-3 (1Evans C.A. Owen-Lynch P.J. Whetton A.D. Dive C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1735-1738PubMed Google Scholar). Cell survival was associated with the up-regulation of Bcl-xL (17Chen Q. Turner J. Watson A.J.M. Dive C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of Bcl-xL using an antisense approach restored an apoptotic response to IL-3 deprivation with v-Abl PTK active. 2Q. Chen and C. Dive, unpublished results. However, the mechanism whereby v-Abl PTK promoted growth arrest remained unknown. Here we describe the transcriptional up-regulation of p21WAF-1 3 h after IL-3 withdrawal in cells with active v-Abl PTK. We also report that readdition of IL-3 to cells with v-Abl PTK active prevented the inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4, allowing proliferation despite the maintained high levels of p21WAF-1 expression. For Western blot analyses, p21WAF-1was detected with either monoclonal anti-p21WAF-1 Ab-4 or polyclonal anti-p21WAF-1 Ab-5 (Calbiochem, Cambridge, MA). PCNA was detected with monoclonal antibody PC10, CDK2 with polyclonal antibody C22, and CDK4 with polyclonal antibody M2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Actin was detected with monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Sigma). All primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and visualized using Enhanced ChemiLuminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For flow cytometric analyses, p21WAF-1was detected using monoclonal anti-p21WAF-1 antibodies Ab-4, Ab-6 (Calbiochem), or WA-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Borek Vojlesek). The irrelevant antibody control was IgG1 mouse anti-Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase antibody. Primary antibodies were detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako). For confocal microscopy, monoclonal anti-p21WAF-1 SX118 (Calbiochem) or polyclonal anti-p21WAF-1 was used followed by Alexa fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The IC.DP cell line was derived from IL-3-dependent murine mast progenitor cell line IC2.9 by stable transfection of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the v-Abl PTK (18Kipreos E.T. Lee G.J. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1345-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely maintained in Fischer's medium supplemented with horse serum (10%v/v) (both from Life Technologies, Inc.) and IL-3 conditioned medium (3% v/v) (19Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). For IL-3 withdrawal experiments, v-Abl PTK was activated or inactivated by incubation of cells at 32 or 39 °C respectively, for 2 h prior to washing cells in Fischer's medium (1Evans C.A. Owen-Lynch P.J. Whetton A.D. Dive C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1735-1738PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then cultured for up to 96 h at either temperature. Where appropriate, IL-3 was restored to the culture medium of IC.DP cells with v-Abl PTK active for 48 h, after the initial IL-3 withdrawal, or cells were maintained in the presence of IL-3 throughout the experiment. Cells were treated with actinomycin D (1 μg/ml), cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), or etoposide (10 μm) as appropriate. Parental IC2.9 cells were used as a control for the effect of culture temperature. Cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol (70% v/v) and incubated with propidium iodide (Molecular Probes; 10 μg/ml) for 5 min prior to analysis of DNA content by flow cytometry. Red fluorescence (DNA-bound propidium, linear scale, 630 ± 22 nm) was analyzed by a Becton Dickinson FACSVantage cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using the 488-nm line of the Enterprise laser, (Coherent, Palo Alto, CA) set to excite at 250 mW. Cell debris was excluded by electronic gating of forward and orthogonal light scatter profiles, prior to analysis of DNA content. For flow cytometric analyses of p21WAF-1, cells were harvested and fixed in formaldehyde (1%v/v in phosphate-buffered saline). Immunostaining for p21WAF-1 was carried out using a panel of monoclonal anti-p21WAF-1 antibodies (Ab-4, Ab-6, and WA-1). The majority of experiments were conducted using WA-1 (1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 μg/ml digitonin) and secondary antibody goat anti-mouse conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyante (1:40). Cell debris was excluded, and forward and orthogonal light scatter were measured simultaneously with green fluorescence (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody; 530 ± 30 nm, log scale) as described above. Data were analyzed using CellQuest and CellFit BD software. Statistical analysis was by the two-tailed Student's t test at the p = 0.05 level of significance. Analysis was performed using the Microsoft Excel package (Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, WA). For confocal microscopy, cells were harvested and cytospun onto glass slides before fixing in ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1 v/v) for 5 min. Cells were incubated with blocking/permeablilization buffer (0.15m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.3 mmNa2HPO4, and 25 mm Trizma base) containing bovine serum albumin (0.1%w/v), Triton X (0.1% v/v), and fetal calf serum (1% v/v)) for 30 min. p21WAF-1 was detected using SX118 at 1 μg/ml or polyclonal anti-p21WAF-1 at 5 μg/ml in diluent (blocking buffer containing bovine serum albumin (0.1% w/v), Triton X (0.05% v/v), and fetal calf serum (1% v/v)) for 1 h, followed by anti-mouse 488 Alexa antibody (1:100 in diluent) for 30 min. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml containing 100 μg/ml RNase) by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Fluorescence was detected with excitation wavelengths of 488 or 568 nm using a Leica TCS-4D confocal microscope. Cells were pulse-labeled with BrdU (100 μm) for 1 h at 32 °C and fixed in 1 ml formaldehyde (1% w/v in phosphate-buffered saline). DNA was partially denatured by treatment with 1 ml of 2n HCl for 30 min at room temperature. Incorporated BrdU was detected by flow cytometry after incubation of cells with monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 μg/ml digitonin) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody (1:40) for 30 min. DNA was counterstained with propidium iodide, and red fluorescence was analyzed as described above. Western blotting was carried out according to a standard protocol (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 481-501Google Scholar). In brief, 30 μg of protein from cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 14% gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunodetection of p21WAF-1 was conducted using Ab-4 (1 μg/ml) and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1:3000), followed by detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (see above). Equal protein loading was verified by measurement of actin levels. Protein level was assessed using an imaging densitometer and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). RNA was extracted using RNAzol (Biogenesis, Poole, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction kit (Stratagene Ltd, Cambridge, UK). PCR was then performed using murine specific p21WAF-1 primers (Sigma-Genosys Ltd., Pampisford, UK). Sense primer was 5′-CATTCAGAGCCACAGGCACC-3′ and antisense primer and 5′-CTCCTGACCCACAGCAGAAG-3′. CDK2 and CDK4 activities were analyzed as previously described (21Dulic V. Lees E. Reed S.I. Science. 1992; 257: 1958-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In brief, 150 μg of protein from cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of polyclonal anti-CDK2 or CDK4 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in 2× kinase buffer: 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mmβ-glycerphosphate, 2 mm NaF, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 μm cAMP-dependent kinase inhibitor protein kinase inhibitor. Kinase assays were prepared with 2× kinase buffer and calf thymus histone H1 (1 mg/ml). Reactions were started by addition of [32P]ATP (1:100 in 0.5 mm cold ATP in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by heating to 95 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography. Cell lysates were prepared using Triton X lysis buffer: 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture. 150 μg of protein from cell lysates was precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by immunoprecipitation using polyclonal anti-p21WAF-1 Ab-5. Immune complexes were harvested with protein A, and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as above. Immunodetection was carried out using monoclonal anti-p21WAF-1 Ab-4 (1 μg/ml), monoclonal anti-PCNA (2 μg/ml), polyclonal anti-CDK2 (1 μg/ml), or polyclonal anti-CDK4 (1 μg/ml). IgPhor two-dimensional gel equipment and reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ten million cells were lysed directly into rehydration/lysis buffer containing 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 65 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% (v/v) immobilized pH gradient ampholites. For the first dimension, lysates were subjected to isoelectric focusing for 90 KVh on a precast pH gradient gel (pH 3–10 linear gradient). Second dimensional electrophoresis was carried out by standard SDS-PAGE on 15% gels, and p21WAF-1 was detected by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-p21WAF-1 (1 μg/ml) as described above. Fig. 1 confirms our previous studies that in the presence of active v-Abl PTK (at 32 °C) there was no change in viable IC.DP cell number following the withdrawal of IL-3 (17Chen Q. Turner J. Watson A.J.M. Dive C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, in IC.DP cells with inactive v-Abl PTK (at 39 °C) and parental IC2.9 cells (with no v-Abl PTK), there was a decrease in viable cell number with time (Fig. 1 and Ref.1Evans C.A. Owen-Lynch P.J. Whetton A.D. Dive C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1735-1738PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of cell cycle phase distribution in IC.DP cells after IL-3 withdrawal with v-Abl PTK active demonstrated that by 24 h there was a 10% increase of cells in G1 phase and a corresponding decrease in cells in G2 phase of the cell cycle, indicating that v-Abl allows the completion of ongoing rounds of DNA synthesis but no reinitiation from G1 (TableI).Table IPercentage of cell cycle distribution up to 72 h after IL-3 withdrawal of IC.DP cells containing activated v-Abl PTKTime after IL-3 withdrawalMean ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab DNA was stained with propidium iodide, and cell cycle phase distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry. v-Abl PTK activation in the absence of IL-3 resulted in the accumulation of cells at the G1/S checkpoint. So we examined the effects of IL-3 withdrawal and/or v-Abl PTK activation on the cellular levels of the CDKI p21WAF-1. The DNA sequence of p21WAF-1 in IC.DP cells was confirmed as being wild type (data not shown). Fig. 2 Ashows that v-Abl PTK activation results in the up-regulation of p21WAF-1 as early as 3 h after IL-3 withdrawal, with a 5-fold increase observed by 24 h (mean, n = 3). Conversely, when v-Abl PTK was inactivated in IL-3-deprived IC.DP cells and parental IC.9 cells (no v-Abl PTK) at both 32 °C and 39 °C, there was no up-regulation of p21WAF-1; instead its level decreased as cells died. The readdition of IL-3 to IC2.9 cells that had been deprived of this cytokine for 2 h did not increase p21WAF-1 levels above basal levels (data not shown). Taken together these data show that the removal of the mitogenic stimulus of IL-3 per se did not cause a 5-fold increase in p21WAF-1 but that this resulted from v-Abl PTK signaling. The most notable effect of v-Abl PTK shown in Fig. 2 was the suprastimulation of p21WAF-1levels. Does this mean that the readdition of IL-3 would fail to stimulate stationary cells with v-Abl PTK active to re-enter the cell cycle? Would IL-3 decrease p21WAF-1 levels returning them to basal levels? To investigate this, cell population growth was monitored by measurement of viable cell number (Fig.3 A) and by S phase traverse following pulse labeling with BrdU (Fig. 3 B). Viable cell number doubled 48 h after the readdition of IL-3 to cells with v-Abl PTK activity maintained. Immediately prior to IL-3 withdrawal there were 12% (12 ± 3%, n = 3) cells in S phase, 48 h after IL-3 withdrawal the percentage S phase cells was reduced to 6% (6 ± 2%, n = 3), but 24 h after the readdition of IL-3 to this stationary cell population, the percentage of cells moving through S phase was increased to 17% (17 ± 4%, n = 3). Fig. 3 Cdemonstrates that despite this increase in cell cycle traverse, the v-Abl PTK-mediated up-regulation of p21WAF-1 was maintained. When v-Abl PTK was activated in cells continually cultured in the presence of IL-3, p21WAF-1 levels were elevated 6-fold (mean n = 3) despite continued cell proliferation (Fig. 3 E). Parallel experiments with parental 2.9 cells (no v-Abl PTK) demonstrated that there were no temperature-dependent changes in the levels of p21WAF-1 (data not shown). The levels and activities of CDK2 (which acts at both G1/S and G2/M boundaries) and CDK4 (which acts only at G1/S) were assessed for cells deprived of IL-3 for 48 h and protected by v-Abl PTK and compared with those from cells that were restimulated with IL-3 for 48 h that had re-entered the cell cycle. CDK2 or CDK 4 were immunoprecipitated, and the levels coimmunoprecipitated p21WAF-1 were analyzed by Western blotting. The levels of p21WAF-1 associated with CDK2 and CDK4 when v-Abl PTK was activated was regardless of the presence or absence of IL-3 (Fig. 3 D). Although p21WAF-1levels were elevated in the protein complex, the protein expression levels of CDK2 and CDK4 were the same with or without IL-3 (Fig.3 D). The activity of CDK2 or CDK4 in these immunoprecipitates was assessed in vitro by measurement of substrate phosphorylation using histone H1. Predictably, CDK activities were high in the presence of IL-3 and lowered when the cytokine was absent (Fig. 3 D). These data prove that increased levels of p21WAF-1 bound to CDK2 or CDK4 do not always inhibit their activity. This finding necessarily implicates an IL-3-sensitive mechanism for inactivation of the activity of p21WAF-1 as a CDKI. To probe the mechanism of up-regulation of p21WAF-1 by v-Abl PTK and the effects of IL-3 upon this, we examined p21WAF-1 mRNA levels using RT-PCR. An increase in p21WAF-1 transcript was observed in IC.DP cells with v-Abl PTK active in nonproliferating cells in the absence of IL-3, when high levels of p21WAF-1 protein were detected (Fig.2 A). However, in proliferating IC.DP cells in the presence of IL-3 with v-Abl PTK active and up-regulated p21WAF-1protein levels (Fig. 3 E), there was no increase in p21WAF-1 transcript (Fig.4 A). Treatment of IL-3-stimulated IC.DP cells with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide resulted in the stabilization of p53 and up-regulation of p21WAF-1 in the presence or absence of v-Abl PTK activity (data not shown). Here the elevation of p21WAF-1 protein is mediated by transcription after DNA damage, but in this case, p21WAF-1 transcription is not prevented by the IL-3 signal (Fig. 4 A, lane E). When transcription was inhibited with actinomycin D, the up-regulation of p21WAF-1 protein was abolished in cells with v-Abl PTK active in the absence of IL-3 but not in the presence of IL-3 at 3 h (Fig. 4 B, panel i). When translation was inhibited with cycloheximide, the up-regulation of p21WAF-1protein was abolished in cells both in the presence and absence of IL-3 (Fig. 4 B, panels i and ii). Taken together these data implicate that both transcriptional and translational mechanisms drive the up-regulation of p21WAF-1 by active v-Abl PTK in IL-3-deprived cells. However, inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D had no effect on the initial up-regulation of p21WAF-1 by v-Abl PTK in the presence of IL-3. Thus, the increase in p21WAF-1 protein levels at 3 h must be mediated via continued translation of existing p21WAF-1 transcript. These data illustrate two distinct mechanisms that both lead to the elevation of p21WAF-1 protein level in IC.DP cells but that result in different functional forms of p21WAF-1: p21WAF-1 active as a CDKI in nonproliferating cells but inactive in proliferating cells. To characterize further the mechanism whereby v-Abl PTK up-regulated p21WAF-1 and the effects of IL-3 upon this, flow cytometric analysis of p21WAF-1 was performed in intact, fixed cells using a panel of anti-p21WAF-1 monoclonal antibodies (Fig.5 A). Of the three antibodies that detected p21WAF-1 in IC.DP cells, only WA-1 revealed changes in p21WAF-1 immunoreactivity after v-Abl PTK activation, and this was dependent on the presence of IL-3. Fig.5 B (panel i) illustrates that the increase in p21WAF-1 protein observed by Western blot was not detected using the C-terminal specific antibody WA-1 and flow cytometry in cell cycle-arrested IC.DP cells. The basal level of p21WAF-1 was still detectable, suggesting that the newly transcribed and newly synthesized p21WAF-1 protein had been modified to mask this C-terminal epitope. However, when IL-3 was present, a significant increase in p21WAF-1 associated immunofluorescence was detected using WA-1 (p < 0.01) in agreement with Western blot results (Figs. 3 E and 5 B,panel ii); in this cellular context the C terminus of p21WAF-1 was exposed on the newly synthesized protein. When v-Abl PTK was inactive, both in the presence and absence of IL-3 (Fig.5 B, panels iii and iv), no increase in p21WAF-1 associated fluorescence was detected, and a subpopulation of cells were observed in both cases that had no detectable p21WAF-1-associated fluorescence. In addition, confocal microscopy was employed to confirm the IL-3-dependent changes in the availability for antibody binding to the p21WAF-1 C terminus observed by flow cytometry. Fig. 5 C (panel i) demonstrates that in the absence of IL-3, the C terminus of p21WAF-1 was inaccessible to another C-terminal epitope-specific p21WAF-1 antibody SX118 despite v-Abl PTK-mediated up-regulation of p21WAF-1. However, in the presence of IL-3, the p21WAF-1 C-terminal epitope for SX118 binding is available (Fig. 5 C, panel ii), and the up-regulated p21WAF-1 protein was detectable. Together these results indicate that in IC.DP cells with active v-Abl PTK, the C terminus of p21WAF-1 is occluded under conditions of cell cycle arrest and exposed during cell proliferation. This may reflect a difference in p21WAF-1 protein conformation or a difference in p21WAF-1 protein-protein interactions in the presence of IL-3 to reveal the C terminus. To investigate the existence of different forms of p21WAF-1in cell cycle arrested and proliferating IC.DP cells with active v-Abl PTK, cell lysates were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Fig. 5 D illustrates that multiple forms of p21WAF-1 do indeed exist in IC.DP cells. Additionally, a different profile of isoforms of p21WAF-1 was observed when comparing lysates from cells stimulated by IL-3 to proliferate with those deprived of IL-3 and cell cycle arrested. Specifically, the presence of IL-3 consistently resulted in the loss of a basic isoform, spot 6, and the appearance of an additional acidic isoform, spot 1, and a neutral isoform, spot 3 when compared with the isoform profile of IL-3-deprived cells. p21WAF-1 has a putative nuclear localization signal at its C terminus and has been reported typically to be a nuclear protein (22Duttaroy A. Qian J.F. Smith J.S. Wang E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, there are also reports that p21WAF-1 can be detected as a cytosolic protein (23Asada A. Yamada T. Ichijo H. Delia D. Miyazono K. Fukumuro K. Mizutani S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). One explanation for the inactivity of high levels of p21WAF-1in IL-3-stimulated IC.DP cells with v-Abl PTK active could be that it is sequestered in the cytosol. The subcellular localization of p21WAF-1 was examined in conditions of cell cycle arrest and proliferation in IC.DP cells with active v-Abl PTK using a polyclonal antibody to ensure the detection of different forms of p21WAF-1. Fig. 6 indicates that p21WAF-1 was detected exclusively in the nuclei of IC.DP cells both in conditions of cell cycle arrest and proliferation. The binding of p21WAF-1 to CDKs and to PCNA is important for p21WAF-1 mediated inhibition of cell cycle progression (11Cayrol C. Knibiehler M. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 14Ogryzko V.Y. Wong P. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the binding of p21WAF-1 to PCNA, CDK2, and CDK4 by coimmunoprecipitation from IC.DP cells with v-Abl PTK active. Fig. 7 illustrates that both in the presence and absence of IL-3, no differences in p21WAF-1 binding of PCNA, CDK2, and CDK4 were detected. These results were also confirmed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (data not shown). We set out to determine how cells deprived of IL-3 with v-Abl PTK activated accumulated in G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 1and Table I). We show that this cell cycle arrest is associated with v-Abl PTK-mediated up-regulation of the “universal” CDKI, p21WAF-1 (Fig. 2 A). After IL-3 withdrawal in the absence of v-Abl PTK activity, there was no up-regulation of p21WAF-1 at any time before the onset of cell death (Fig.2). Thus, the activation of v-Abl PTK rather than the withdrawal of the mitogen per se caused the observed increase in this CDKI. p21WAF-1 has been shown to have a dual role in the regulation of CDK4 kinase activity: Transfection of p21WAF-1 into U20S cells resulted in the assembly of kinase active CDK4/cyclin D1 complexes (7LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Here we show that in the presence of v-Abl PTK and IL-3 cells proliferate but the up-regulated p21WAF-1 fails to inactivate the kinase activity of both CDK4 and CDK2 (both of which remain at basal expression levels). p21WAF-1 function may therefore vary depending on the incoming signal(s): when it is up-regulated by v-Abl PTK signaling in the absence of IL-3, p21WAF-1 functions as a CDKI, whereas in the presence of IL-3 it has a distinct function possibly as an assembly factor and/or subcellular localization cue for CDK/cyclins, although we found no evidence of any difference in the subcellular distribution of p21WAF-1 itself in the presence and absence of IL-3 (Fig. 6). We sought to determine at a molecular level how IL-3 signaling bypasses the cell cycle arrest associated with the up-regulation of p21WAF-1 and inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4. v-Abl PTK activation resulted in the transcriptional up-regulation of p21WAF-1 mRNA and protein level (Figs. 2 A,3 E, and 4 A). Initially p21WAF-1 was identified as the main transcriptional target of p53 (4El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). Protein stabilization of p53 follows DNA damage in IC.DP cells (data not shown), but this did not occur after IL-3 withdrawal with v-Abl active. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out a p53-dependent mechanism for v-Abl PTK-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of p21WAF-1. There are p53-independent mechanisms to transcriptionally up-regulate p21WAF-1 via a diverse group of transcription factors including the progesterone receptor, E2F, and several STATs (STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5; reviewed in Ref. 24Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). We do not yet know which transcriptional activator(s) drive p21WAF-1up-regulation downstream of v-Abl PTK signaling; however, because STATs are activated downstream of v-Abl PTK signaling (25Danial N.N. Pernis A. Rothman P.B. Science. 1995; 269: 1875-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), these seem likely candidates. v-Abl PTK-mediated up-regulation of p21WAF-1 protein level was further increased by the readdition of IL-3, and this was concomitant with entry to the cell cycle (Fig. 3, A andC). In the presence of this mitogen, p21WAF-1up-regulation was not transcriptional (Fig. 4, A andB, panel ii). Several transcription independent mechanisms to up-regulate p21WAF-1 have been reported. Increased stabilization of p21WAF-1 mRNA has led to up-regulated p21WAF-1 protein, for example, by binding of the Elav-like protein HuD to the transcript (26Joseph B. Orlian M. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20511-20516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Increased protein stability contributed to increased levels of p21WAF-1 by direct inhibition of the proteosome (27Blagosklovy M.V. Wu G.S. Omura S. El-Deiry W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) or binding and abrogation of PCNA function, thus preventing progression through the proteosome (28Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, neither of these mechanism(s) are consistent with our observations in IL-3 replete IC.DP cells with v-Abl PTK activated, implying another route to p21WAF-1, possibly by increase translation of existing mRNA, although further work is required to confirm this. IL-3 does not suppress the transcription of p21WAF-1 in every cellular context as shown in Fig.4 A (lane E) where the etoposide damage signal maintains p21WAF-1 transcription in the presence of IL-3. One of the striking questions posed by our studies is how IC.DP cells proliferate at the same rate with either basal levels of p21WAF-1 (with IL-3 but inactive v-Abl PTK) or with 6-fold up-regulated levels of p21WAF-1 (with IL-3 and active v-Abl PTK), where in the latter case p21WAF-1, although associated in increased amount with CDK4 and CDK2 (Fig. 3 D), does not function as a CDKI. We showed that the p21WAF-1protein up-regulated in proliferating IC.DP cells exists in a different conformation to that in cell cycle arrested cells, reflected by different C-terminal epitope availability (Fig. 5, B andC). This suggests either different conformational forms of p21WAF-1 and/or a change in protein-protein interactions. Our studies using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrate that there are several isoforms of p21WAF-1 and that the isoform profile is different in IC.DP cells with v-Abl PTK active in the presence or absence of IL-3 (Fig. 5 D). We are currently pursuing the identity of these isoforms. Post-translational modification of p21WAF-1 at its C terminus can occur; phosphorylation in the PCNA binding domain of p21WAF-1 has been recently reported (29Scott M.T. Morrice N. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11529-11537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and post-translational modification might affect its subcellular location and/or the binding of p21WAF-1 to other proteins. However, we have not detected any difference in the subcellular location or the binding of several established binding partners of p21WAF-1 (Fig. 6, 7), and these parameters could not therefore account for the changes in epitope availability monitored by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy (Fig.5, B and C). Other p21WAF-1 binding proteins have been identified including GADD45 (30Kearsey J, M. Coates P.J. Precott A.R. Warbrick E. Hall P.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1675-1683PubMed Google Scholar), stress-activated protein kinases (31Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.-J. Nature. 1996; 381: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (23Asada A. Yamada T. Ichijo H. Delia D. Miyazono K. Fukumuro K. Mizutani S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), but the effects of these binding partners on p21WAF-1 function as a CDKI are currently unknown. Interestingly, the protein phosphatase inhibitor SET binds the C terminus of p21WAF-1 (in the region of the WA-1 and SX118 binding sites), abrogating its function as an inhibitor of CDK2 specifically bound to cyclin E (32Estanyol J.M. Jaumot M. Casanovas O. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Agell N. Bachs O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33161-33165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We were unable to demonstrate SET binding to p21WAF-1 in IC.DP cells cultured with or without IL-3 (data not shown). In summary, we propose a model whereby v-Abl PTK reinforces cell cycle arrest in the absence of IL-3 that is associated with the transcriptional up-regulation of p21WAF-1 protein, in a form bound to PCNA and CDK2 or CDK4 that functions as a CDKI (Fig.8). In conditions of IL-3-driven cell proliferation, the transcriptional up-regulation of p21WAF-1 by v-Abl PTK is abrogated, yet p21WAF-1 protein is maintained at elevated levels. However, these high levels of p21WAF-1 molecules in proliferating cells exist in a different form that is functionally inactive with respect to CDK inhibition. We are currently investigating the mechanism of inactivation of p21WAF-1 by IL-3 with respect to CDKI function in proliferating cells expressing elevated levels of this cell cycle regulator. Although it may seem counter-intuitive that an oncogenic tyrosine kinase reinforces cell cycle arrest, we speculate that there are circumstances in which this might be advantageous for a tumor cell (e.g. when it is located in a hostile microenvironment with limiting growth/survival factors). Entry to cell cycle in the absence of appropriate mitogenic stimuli promotes apoptosis (33Colombel M. Olsson C.A. Ng P.Y. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1992; 16: 4313-4319Google Scholar). Therefore, the rapid imposition of p21WAF-1 driven G1arrest may be important in the mechanism whereby v-Abl PTK maintains cell viability during the period prior to the up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL (17Chen Q. Turner J. Watson A.J.M. Dive C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When p21WAF-1 up-regulation was abrogated in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells using an antisense approach, instead of growth arrest after irradiation cells committed to apoptosis (34Tian H. Wittmack E.K. Jorgensen T.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 679-684PubMed Google Scholar). If we can understand how growth arrest associated with up-regulated levels of p21WAF-1 is overridden by incoming signals from mitogens, this information might be exploitable therapeutically to modulate the cellular decision between growth arrest and apoptosis. In situations where tumor cells survive after drug-induced damage because they can undergo p21WAF-1-mediated cell cycle arrest and buy time to repair the damage, they may instead be pushed through the cell cycle via inactivation of p21WAF-1 function and commit to apoptosis as they attempt replication on a damage DNA template.
