https://openalex.org/W2165515236,"We systematically study how diverse physiologic systems in the human organism dynamically interact and collectively behave to produce distinct physiologic states and functions. This is a fundamental question in the new interdisciplinary field of Network Physiology, and has not been previously explored. Introducing the novel concept of Time Delay Stability (TDS), we develop a computational approach to identify and quantify networks of physiologic interactions from long-term continuous, multi-channel physiological recordings. We also develop a physiologically-motivated visualization framework to map networks of dynamical organ interactions to graphical objects encoded with information about the coupling strength of network links quantified using the TDS measure. Applying a system-wide integrative approach, we identify distinct patterns in the network structure of organ interactions, as well as the frequency bands through which these interactions are mediated. We establish first maps representing physiologic organ network interactions and discover basic rules underlying the complex hierarchical reorganization in physiologic networks with transitions across physiologic states. Our findings demonstrate a direct association between network topology and physiologic function, and provide new insights into understanding how health and distinct physiologic states emerge from networked interactions among nonlinear multi-component complex systems. The presented here investigations are initial steps in building a first atlas of dynamic interactions among organ systems."
https://openalex.org/W2213245363,"Studies of neonatal neural pathologies and development of appropriate therapeutics are hampered by a lack of relevant in vitro models of neonatal blood-brain barrier (BBB). To establish such a model, we have developed a novel blood-brain barrier on a chip (B3C) that comprises a tissue compartment and vascular channels placed side-by-side mimicking the three-dimensional morphology, size and flow characteristics of microvessels in vivo. Rat brain endothelial cells (RBEC) isolated from neonatal rats were seeded in the vascular channels of B3C and maintained under shear flow conditions, while neonatal rat astrocytes were cultured under static conditions in the tissue compartment of the B3C. RBEC formed continuous endothelial lining with a central lumen along the length of the vascular channels of B3C and exhibited tight junction formation, as measured by the expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). ZO-1 expression significantly increased with shear flow in the vascular channels and with the presence of astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) or astrocytes cultured in the tissue compartment. Consistent with in vivo BBB, B3C allowed endfeet-like astrocyte-endothelial cell interactions through a porous interface that separates the tissue compartment containing cultured astrocytes from the cultured RBEC in the vascular channels. The permeability of fluorescent 40 kDa dextran from vascular channel to the tissue compartment significantly decreased when RBEC were cultured in the presence of astrocytes or ACM (from 41.0 ± 0.9 x 10-6 cm/s to 2.9 ± 1.0 x 10-6 cm/s or 1.1±0.4 x 10-6 cm/s, respectively). Measurement of electrical resistance in B3C further supports that the addition of ACM significantly improves the barrier function in neonatal RBEC. Moreover, B3C exhibits significantly improved barrier characteristics compared to the transwell model and B3C permeability was not significantly different from the in vivo BBB permeability in neonatal rats. In summary, we developed a first dynamic in vitro neonatal BBB on a chip (B3C) that closely mimics the in vivo microenvironment, offers the flexibility of real time analysis, and is suitable for studies of BBB function as well as screening of novel therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2174836001,"Many immunostimulants act as vaccine adjuvants via activation of the innate immune system, although in many cases it is unclear which specific molecules contribute to the stimulatory activity. QS-21 is a defined, highly purified, and soluble saponin adjuvant currently used in licensed and exploratory vaccines, including vaccines against malaria, cancer, and HIV-1. However, little is known about the mechanisms of cellular activation induced by QS-21. We observed QS-21 to elicit caspase-1-dependent IL-1β and IL-18 release in antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells when co-stimulated with the TLR4-agonist adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A. Furthermore, our data suggest that the ASC-NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for QS-21-induced IL-1β/IL-18 release. At higher concentrations, QS-21 induced macrophage and dendritic cell death in a caspase-1-, ASC-, and NLRP3-independent manner, whereas the presence of cholesterol rescued cell viability. A nanoparticulate adjuvant that contains QS-21 as part of a heterogeneous mixture of saponins also induced IL-1β in an NLRP3-dependent manner. Interestingly, despite the role NLRP3 plays for cellular activation in vitro, NLRP3-deficient mice immunized with HIV-1 gp120 and QS-21 showed significantly higher levels of Th1 and Th2 antigen-specific T cell responses and increased IgG1 and IgG2c compared with wild type controls. Thus, we have identified QS-21 as a nonparticulate single molecular saponin that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, but this signaling pathway may contribute to decreased antigen-specific responses in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2218503759,"TGF-β is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates a wide range of cellular actions and pathophysiological processes. TGF-β signaling is spatiotemporally fine-tuned. As a key negative regulator of TGF-β signaling, Smad7 exerts its inhibitory effects by blocking receptor activity, inducing receptor degradation or interfering with Smad-DNA binding. However, the functions and the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of Smad7 in TGF-β signaling are still not fully understood. In this study we report a novel mechanism whereby Smad7 antagonizes TGF-β signaling at the Smad level. Smad7 oligomerized with R-Smad proteins upon TGF-β signaling and directly inhibited R-Smad activity, as assessed by Gal4-luciferase reporter assays. Mechanistically, Smad7 competes with Smad4 to associate with R-Smads and recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L to activated R-Smads, leading to their polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Similar to the R-Smad-Smad4 oligomerization, the interaction between R-Smads and Smad7 is mediated by their mad homology 2 (MH2) domains. A positive-charged basic region including the L3/β8 loop-strand module and adjacent amino acids in the MH2 domain of Smad7 is essential for the interaction. These results shed new light on the regulation of TGF-β signaling by Smad7."

HIV infection and these coinfections accelerate disease progression reciprocally. This study evaluated the prevalence and incidence of these coinfections in HIV1-positive MSM in Germany.As part of a nationwide, multicenter, prospective cohort study of HIV-infected MSM, plasma samples collected yearly were screened for HBsAg and antibodies to HBc, HBs, HCV, and syphilis. Samples with indications of active HBV or HCV infection were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Prevalence and incidence of each infection and incidence rates per study participant were calculated, and incidences over 4-year time intervals compared.This study screened 5,445 samples from 1,843 MSM. Median age at HIV seroconversion was 33 years. Prevalences of active, cleared, and occult HBV, and of active/cleared HCV were 1.7%, 27.1%, 0.2%, and 8.2%, respectively, and 47.5% had been effectively vaccinated against HBV. Prevalence of antibodies to Treponema pallidum and of triple or quadruple sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were 39.6% and 18.9%, respectively. Prevalence of STI, cleared HBV, HBV vaccination, and history of syphilis differed significantly among age groups. Incidences of HBV, HCV, and syphilis were 2.51, 1.54, and 4.06 per 100 person-years, respectively. Incidences of HCV and syphilis increased over time. HCV incidence was significantly higher in MSM coinfected with syphilis and living in Berlin, and syphilis incidence was significantly higher for MSM living in Berlin.Despite extensive HBV vaccination campaigns, fewer than 50% of screened MSM were effectively vaccinated, with a high proportion of HIV-positive MSM coinfected with HBV. High rates of STI coinfections in HIV-positive MSM and increasing incidences emphasize the need for better tailored campaigns for HBV vaccination and STI prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2261400749,"There is a great challenge in combining soil proximal spectra and remote sensing spectra to improve the accuracy of soil organic carbon (SOC) models. This is primarily because mixing of spectral data from different sources and technologies to improve soil models is still in its infancy. The first objective of this study was to integrate information of SOC derived from visible near-infrared reflectance (Vis-NIR) spectra in the laboratory with remote sensing (RS) images to improve predictions of topsoil SOC in the Skjern river catchment, Denmark. The second objective was to improve SOC prediction results by separately modeling uplands and wetlands. A total of 328 topsoil samples were collected and analyzed for SOC. Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT5), Landsat Data Continuity Mission (Landsat 8) images, laboratory Vis-NIR and other ancillary environmental data including terrain parameters and soil maps were compiled to predict topsoil SOC using Cubist regression and Bayesian kriging. The results showed that the model developed from RS data, ancillary environmental data and laboratory spectral data yielded a lower root mean square error (RMSE) (2.8%) and higher R2 (0.59) than the model developed from only RS data and ancillary environmental data (RMSE: 3.6%, R2: 0.46). Plant-available water (PAW) was the most important predictor for all the models because of its close relationship with soil organic matter content. Moreover, vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), were very important predictors in SOC spatial models. Furthermore, the 'upland model' was able to more accurately predict SOC compared with the 'upland & wetland model'. However, the separately calibrated 'upland and wetland model' did not improve the prediction accuracy for wetland sites, since it was not possible to adequately discriminate the vegetation in the RS summer images. We conclude that laboratory Vis-NIR spectroscopy adds critical information that significantly improves the prediction accuracy of SOC compared to using RS data alone. We recommend the incorporation of laboratory spectra with RS data and other environmental data to improve soil spatial modeling and digital soil mapping (DSM)."
https://openalex.org/W2231780556,"Exposure to repetitive seizures is known to promote convulsions which depend on specific patterns of network activity. We aimed at evaluating the changes in seizure phenotype and neuronal network activation caused by a modified 6-Hz corneal stimulation model of psychomotor seizures. Mice received up to 4 sessions of 6-Hz corneal stimulation with fixed current amplitude of 32 mA and inter-stimulation interval of 72 h. Video-electroencephalography showed that evoked seizures were characterized by a motor component and a non-motor component. Seizures always appeared in frontal cortex, but only at the fourth stimulation they involved the hippocampus, suggesting the establishment of an epileptogenic process. Duration of seizure non-motor component progressively decreased after the second session, whereas convulsive seizures remained unchanged. In addition, a more severe seizure phenotype, consisting of tonic-clonic generalized convulsions, was predominant after the second session. Immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence experiments revealed a significant increase in neuronal activity occurring in the lateral amygdala after the fourth session, most likely due to activity of principal cells. These findings indicate a predominant role of amygdala in promoting progressively more severe convulsions as well as the late recruitment of the hippocampus in the seizure spread. We propose that the repeated 6-Hz corneal stimulation model may be used to investigate some mechanisms of epileptogenesis and to test putative antiepileptogenic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2116275849,"Indolmycin is a natural tryptophan analog that competes with tryptophan for binding to tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) enzymes. Bacterial and eukaryotic cytosolic TrpRSs have comparable affinities for tryptophan (Km ∼ 2 μm), and yet only bacterial TrpRSs are inhibited by indolmycin. Despite the similarity between these ligands, Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bs)TrpRS preferentially binds indolmycin ∼1500-fold more tightly than its tryptophan substrate. Kinetic characterization and crystallographic analysis of BsTrpRS allowed us to probe novel aspects of indolmycin inhibitory action. Previous work had revealed that long range coupling to residues within an allosteric region called the D1 switch of BsTrpRS positions the Mg2+ ion in a manner that allows it to assist in transition state stabilization. The Mg2+ ion in the inhibited complex forms significantly closer contacts with non-bridging oxygen atoms from each phosphate group of ATP and three water molecules than occur in the (presumably catalytically competent) pre-transition state (preTS) crystal structures. We propose that this altered coordination stabilizes a ground state Mg2+·ATP configuration, accounting for the high affinity inhibition of BsTrpRS by indolmycin. Conversely, both the ATP configuration and Mg2+ coordination in the human cytosolic (Hc)TrpRS preTS structure differ greatly from the BsTrpRS preTS structure. The effect of these differences is that catalysis occurs via a different transition state stabilization mechanism in HcTrpRS with a yet-to-be determined role for Mg2+. Modeling indolmycin into the tryptophan binding site points to steric hindrance and an inability to retain the interactions used for tryptophan substrate recognition as causes for the 1000-fold weaker indolmycin affinity to HcTrpRS.

https://openalex.org/W2254133189,"The aim of this study was to further characterize pharmacological properties of two phenylpiperazine derivatives: 1-{2-[2-(2,6-dimethlphenoxy)ethoxy]ethyl}-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazynine hydrochloride (HBK-14) and 2-[2-(2-chloro-6-methylphenoxy)ethoxy]ethyl-4-(2- methoxyphenyl)piperazynine dihydrochloride (HBK-15) in radioligand binding and functional in vitro assays as well as in vivo models. Antidepressant-like properties were investigated in the forced swim test (FST) in mice and rats. Anxiolytic-like activity was evaluated in the four-plate test in mice and elevated plus maze test (EPM) in rats. Imipramine and escitalopram were used as reference drugs in the FST, and diazepam was used as a standard anxiolytic drug in animal models of anxiety. Our results indicate that HBK-14 and HBK-15 possess high or moderate affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2, adrenergic α1, and dopaminergic D2 receptors as well as being full 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptor antagonists. We also present their potent antidepressant-like activity (HBK-14-FST mice: 2.5 and 5 mg/kg; FST rats: 5 mg/kg) and (HBK-15-FST mice: 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg; FST rats: 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg). We show that HBK-14 (four-plate test: 2.5 and 5 mg/kg; EPM: 2.5 mg/kg) and HBK-15 (four-plate test: 2.5 and 5 mg/kg; EPM: 5 mg/kg) possess anxiolytic-like properties. Among the two, HBK-15 has stronger antidepressant-like properties, and HBK-14 displays greater anxiolytic-like activity. Lastly, we demonstrate the involvement of serotonergic system, particularly 5-HT1A receptor, in the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like actions of investigated compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2149831801,"The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of gene variants in key genes influencing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic of carbamazepine (CBZ) on the response in patients with epilepsy.Five SNPs in two candidate genes influencing CBZ transport and metabolism, namely ABCB1 or EPHX1, and CBZ response SCN1A (sodium channel) were genotyped in 145 epileptic patients treated with CBZ as monotherapy and 100 age and sex matched healthy controls. Plasma concentrations of CBZ, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZE) and carbamazepine-10,11-trans dihydrodiol (CBZD) were determined by HPLC-UV-DAD and adjusted for CBZ dosage/kg of body weight.The presence of the SCN1A IVS5-91G>A variant allele is associated with increased epilepsy susceptibility. Furthermore, carriers of the SCN1A IVS5-91G>A variant or of EPHX1 c.337T>C variant presented significantly lower levels of plasma CBZ compared to carriers of the common alleles (0.71 ± 0.28 vs 1.11±0.69 μg/mL per mg/Kg for SCN1A IVS5-91 AA vs GG and 0.76 ± 0.16 vs 0.94 ± 0.49 μg/mL per mg/Kg for EPHX1 c.337 CC vs TT; P<0.05 for both). Carriers of the EPHX1 c.416A>G showed a reduced microsomal epoxide hydrolase activity as reflected by a significantly decreased ratio of CBZD to CBZ (0.13 ± 0.08 to 0.26 ± 0.17, p<0.05) also of CBZD to CBZE (1.74 ± 1.06 to 3.08 ± 2.90; P<0.05) and CDRCBZD (0.13 ± 0.08 vs 0.24 ± 0.19 μg/mL per mg/Kg; P<0.05). ABCB1 3455C>T SNP and SCN1A 3148A>G variants were not associated with significant changes in CBZ pharmacokinetic. Patients resistant to CBZ treatment showed increased dosage of CBZ (657 ± 285 vs 489 ± 231 mg/day; P<0.001) but also increased plasma levels of CBZ (9.84 ± 4.37 vs 7.41 ± 3.43 μg/mL; P<0.001) compared to patients responsive to CBZ treatment. CBZ resistance was not related to any of the SNPs investigated.The SCN1A IVS5-91G>A SNP is associated with susceptibility to epilepsy. SNPs in EPHX1 gene are influencing CBZ metabolism and disposition. CBZ plasma levels are not an indicator of resistance to the therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2137105211,"Uteroplacental tissue plays a key role in substance exchanges between maternal and fetal circulation, and, therefore, in the growth and development of fetuses. In this study, proteomics and western blotting were applied to investigate the changes of proteome in the placenta and endometrium of normal and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) porcine fetuses during mid to late pregnancy (D60, 90, and 110 of gestation). Our results showed that proteins participating in cell structure, energy metabolism, stress response, cell turnover, as well as transport and metabolism of nutrients were differentially expressed in placenta and endometrium between normal and IUGR fetuses. Analysis of functions of these proteins suggests reductions in ATP production and nutrients transport, increases in oxidative stress and apoptosis, and impairment of cell metabolism in IUGR fetuses. Collectively, our findings aid in understanding of the mechanisms responsible for uteroplacental dysfunction in IUGR fetus, and are expected to provide new strategies to reduce fetal growth restriction in pigs and other mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2180295771,"To identify the transcriptional regulatory changes that are most widespread in solid tumors, we performed a pan-cancer analysis using over 600 pairs of tumors and adjacent normal tissues profiled in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Frequency of upregulation was calculated across mRNA expression levels, microRNA expression levels and CpG methylation sites and is provided here as a resource. Frequent tumor-associated alterations were identified using a simple statistical approach. Many of the identified changes were consistent with the increased rate of cell division in cancer, such as the overexpression of cell cycle genes and hypermethylation of PRC2 binding sites. However, we also identified proliferation-independent alterations, which highlight novel pathways essential to tumor formation. Nearly all of the GABA receptors are frequently downregulated, with the gene encoding the delta subunit (GABRD) strongly upregulated as the notable exception. Metabolic genes are also frequently downregulated, particularly alcohol dehydrogenases and others consistent with the decreased role of oxidative phosphorylation in cancerous cells. Alterations in the composition of GABA receptors and metabolism may play a key role in the differentiation of cancer cells, independent of proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2133535105,"Wood specific gravity is a key element in tropical forest ecology. It integrates many aspects of tree mechanical properties and functioning and is an important predictor of tree biomass. Wood specific gravity varies widely among and within species and also within individual trees. Notably, contrasted patterns of radial variation of wood specific gravity have been demonstrated and related to regeneration guilds (light demanding vs. shade-bearing). However, although being repeatedly invoked as a potential source of error when estimating the biomass of trees, both intraspecific and radial variations remain little studied. In this study we characterized detailed pith-to-bark wood specific gravity profiles among contrasted species prominently contributing to the biomass of the forest, i.e., the dominant species, and we quantified the consequences of such variations on the biomass.Radial profiles of wood density at 8% moisture content were compiled for 14 dominant species in the Democratic Republic of Congo, adapting a unique 3D X-ray scanning technique at very high spatial resolution on core samples. Mean wood density estimates were validated by water displacement measurements. Wood density profiles were converted to wood specific gravity and linear mixed models were used to decompose the radial variance. Potential errors in biomass estimation were assessed by comparing the biomass estimated from the wood specific gravity measured from pith-to-bark profiles, from global repositories, and from partial information (outer wood or inner wood).Wood specific gravity profiles from pith-to-bark presented positive, neutral and negative trends. Positive trends mainly characterized light-demanding species, increasing up to 1.8 g.cm-3 per meter for Piptadeniastrum africanum, and negative trends characterized shade-bearing species, decreasing up to 1 g.cm-3 per meter for Strombosia pustulata. The linear mixed model showed the greater part of wood specific gravity variance was explained by species only (45%) followed by a redundant part between species and regeneration guilds (36%). Despite substantial variation in wood specific gravity profiles among species and regeneration guilds, we found that values from the outer wood were strongly correlated to values from the whole profile, without any significant bias. In addition, we found that wood specific gravity from the DRYAD global repository may strongly differ depending on the species (up to 40% for Dialium pachyphyllum).Therefore, when estimating forest biomass in specific sites, we recommend the systematic collection of outer wood samples on dominant species. This should prevent the main errors in biomass estimations resulting from wood specific gravity and allow for the collection of new information to explore the intraspecific variation of mechanical properties of trees."
https://openalex.org/W2156453256,"Macro-algae represent an ideal resource of third generation biofuels, but their use necessitates a refinement of commonly used anaerobic digestion processes. In a previous study, contrasting mixes of dairy slurry and the macro-alga Ulva lactuca were anaerobically digested in mesophilic continuously stirred tank reactors for 40 weeks. Higher proportions of U. lactuca in the feedstock led to inhibited digestion and rapid accumulation of volatile fatty acids, requiring a reduced organic loading rate. In this study, 16S pyrosequencing was employed to characterise the microbial communities of both the weakest (R1) and strongest (R6) performing reactors from the previous work as they developed over a 39 and 27-week period respectively. Comparing the reactor communities revealed clear differences in taxonomy, predicted metabolic orientation and mechanisms of inhibition, while constrained canonical analysis (CCA) showed ammonia and biogas yield to be the strongest factors differentiating the two reactor communities. Significant biomarker taxa and predicted metabolic activities were identified for viable and failing anaerobic digestion of U. lactuca. Acetoclastic methanogens were inhibited early in R1 operation, followed by a gradual decline of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Near-total loss of methanogens led to an accumulation of acetic acid that reduced performance of R1, while a slow decline in biogas yield in R6 could be attributed to inhibition of acetogenic rather than methanogenic activity. The improved performance of R6 is likely to have been as a result of the large Methanosarcina population, which enabled rapid removal of acetic acid, providing favourable conditions for substrate degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2336699147,"Fibroblasts from patients with Type I bipolar disorder (BPD) and their unaffected siblings were obtained from an Old Order Amish pedigree with a high incidence of BPD and reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Established iPSCs were subsequently differentiated into neuroprogenitors (NPs) and then to neurons. Transcriptomic microarray analysis was conducted on RNA samples from iPSCs, NPs and neurons matured in culture for either 2 weeks (termed early neurons, E) or 4 weeks (termed late neurons, L). Global RNA profiling indicated that BPD and control iPSCs differentiated into NPs and neurons at a similar rate, enabling studies of differentially expressed genes in neurons from controls and BPD cases. Significant disease-associated differences in gene expression were observed only in L neurons. Specifically, 328 genes were differentially expressed between BPD and control L neurons including GAD1, glutamate decarboxylase 1 (2.5 fold) and SCN4B, the voltage gated type IV sodium channel beta subunit (-14.6 fold). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the up-regulation of GAD1 in BPD compared to control L neurons. Gene Ontology, GeneGo and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially regulated genes in L neurons suggest that alterations in RNA biosynthesis and metabolism, protein trafficking as well as receptor signaling pathways may play an important role in the pathophysiology of BPD."
https://openalex.org/W2129657594,"Sensing mechanical stresses, including touch, stretch, compression, and gravity, is crucial for growth and development in plants. A good mechanosensor candidate is the Ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive (MS) channel, the pore of which opens to permeate Ca2+ in response to mechanical stresses. However, the structure-function relationships of plant MS channels are poorly understood. Arabidopsis MCA1 and MCA2 form a homotetramer and exhibit Ca2+-permeable MS channel activity; however, their structures have only been partially elucidated. The transmembrane topologies of these ion channels need to be determined in more detail to elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms. We herein determined the topologies of MCA1 and MCA2 using two independent methods, the Suc2C reporter and split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid methods, and found that both proteins are single-pass type I integral membrane proteins with extracellular N termini and intracellular C termini. These results imply that an EF hand-like motif, coiled-coil motif, and plac8 motif are all present in the cytoplasm. Thus, the activities of both channels can be regulated by intracellular Ca2+ and protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2113906918,"Evidence shows that an abnormal deposition of amyloid beta-peptide25-35 (Aβ25-35) was the primary cause of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). And the elimination of Aβ25-35 is considered an important target for the treatment of AD. Triptolide (TP), isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. (TWHF), has been shown to possess a broad spectrum of biological profiles, including neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. In our study investigating the effect and potential mechanism of triptolide on cytotoxicity of differentiated rat pheochromocytoma cell line (the PC12 cell line is often used as a neuronal developmental model) induced by Amyloid-Beta25-35 (Aβ25-35), we used 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry, Western blot, and acridine orange staining to detect whether triptolide could inhibit Aβ25-35-induced cell apoptosis. We focused on the potential role of the autophagy pathway in Aβ25-35-treated differentiated PC12 cells. Our experiments show that cell viability is significantly decreased, and the apoptosis increased in Aβ25-35-treated differentiated PC12 cells. Meanwhile, Aβ25-35 treatment increased the expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 II (LC3 II), which indicates an activation of autophagy. However, triptolide could protect differentiated PC12 cells against Aβ25-35-induced cytotoxicity and attenuate Aβ25-35-induced differentiated PC12 cell apoptosis. Triptolide could also suppress the level of autophagy. In order to assess the effect of autophagy on the protective effects of triptolide in differentiated PC12 cells treated with Aβ25-35, we used 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) and rapamycin (an autophagy activator). MTT assay showed that 3-MA elevated cell viability compared with the Aβ25-35-treated group and rapamycin inhibits the protection of triptolide. These results suggest that triptolide will repair the neurological damage in AD caused by deposition of Aβ25-35 via the autophagy pathway, all of which may provide an exciting view of the potential application of triptolide or TWHF as a future research for AD."
https://openalex.org/W2256891912,"Background Vascular calcification (VC) is primarily studied using cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the use of very different protocols and extreme conditions can provide findings unrelated to VC. In this work we aimed to determine the critical experimental parameters that affect calcification in vitro and to determine the relevance to calcification in vivo. Experimental Procedures and Results Rat VSMC calcification in vitro was studied using different concentrations of fetal calf serum, calcium, and phosphate, in different types of culture media, and using various volumes and rates of change. The bicarbonate content of the media critically affected pH and resulted in supersaturation, depending on the concentration of Ca2+ and Pi. Such supersaturation is a consequence of the high dependence of bicarbonate buffers on CO2 vapor pressure and bicarbonate concentration at pHs above 7.40. Such buffer systems cause considerable pH variations as a result of minor experimental changes. The variations are more critical for DMEM and are negligible when the bicarbonate concentration is reduced to ¼. Particle nucleation and growth were observed by dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. Using 2mM Pi, particles of ~200nm were observed at 24 hours in MEM and at 1 hour in DMEM. These nuclei grew over time, were deposited in the cells, and caused osteogene expression or cell death, depending on the precipitation rate. TEM observations showed that the initial precipitate was amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), which converts into hydroxyapatite over time. In blood, the scenario is different, because supersaturation is avoided by a tightly controlled pH of 7.4, which prevents the formation of PO43--containing ACP. Conclusions The precipitation of ACP in vitro is unrelated to VC in vivo. The model needs to be refined through controlled pH and the use of additional procalcifying agents other than Pi in order to reproduce calcium phosphate deposition in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2259385980,"Detection and identification of anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures (BC) is a well-recognized challenge in clinical microbiology. We studied 100 clinical anaerobic BC isolates to evaluate the performance of BacT/ALERT-FN, -FN Plus (BioMérieux), BACTEC-Plus and -Lytic (Becton Dickinson BioSciences) BC bottles in detection and time to detection (TTD) of anaerobic bacteria. BACTEC Lytic had higher detection rate (94/100, 94%) than BacT/ALERT FN Plus (80/100, 80%) (p<0.01) in the studied material. There was no significant difference in detection of anaerobic bacteria among the remaining bottle types. The 67 anaerobic bacteria that signalled positive in all four bottle types were analyzed to compare the time to detection (TTD) and isolates were directly identified by MALDI-TOF MS. There was a significant difference in TTD among the four bottle types (p<0.0001). The shortest median TTD was 18 h in BACTEC Lytic followed by BacT/ALERT FN (23.5 h), BACTEC Plus (27 h) and finally BacT/ALERT FN Plus (38 h) bottles. In contrast, MALDI-TOF MS performed similarly in all bottle types with accurate identification in 51/67 (76%) BacT/ALERT FN, 51/67 (76%) BacT/ALERT FN Plus, 53/67 (79%) BACTEC Plus and 50/67 (75%) BACTEC Lytic bottles. In conclusion, BACTEC Lytic bottles have significantly better detection rates and shorter TTD compared to the three other bottle types. The anaerobic BC bottles are equally suitable for direct MALDI-TOF MS for rapid and reliable identification of common anaerobic bacteria. Further clinical studies are warranted to investigate the performance of anaerobic BC bottles in detection of anaerobic bacteria and identification by direct MALDI-TOF MS."

Rho has been implicated in Nox4 regulation, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF), a Rho/actin polymerization-controlled coactivator of serum response factor, drives myofibroblast transition from various precursors. We have shown that TGFβ is necessary but insufficient for epithelial-myofibroblast transition in intact epithelia; the other prerequisite is the uncoupling of intercellular contacts, which induces Rho-dependent nuclear translocation of MRTF. Because the Nox4 promoter harbors a serum response factor/MRTF cis-element (CC(A/T)6GG box), we asked if MRTF (and thus cytoskeleton organization) could regulate Nox4 expression. We show that Nox4 protein is robustly induced in kidney tubular cells exclusively by combined application of contact uncoupling and TGFβ. Nox4 knockdown abrogates epithelial-myofibroblast transition-associated reactive oxygen species production. Laser capture microdissection reveals increased Nox4 expression in the tubular epithelium also during obstructive nephropathy. MRTF down-regulation/inhibition suppresses TGFβ/contact disruption-provoked Nox4 protein and mRNA expression, Nox4 promoter activation, and reactive oxygen species production. Mutation of the CC(A/T)6GG box eliminates the synergistic activation of the Nox4 promoter.

Design 24-week randomized open-label prospective evaluation. Method Participants were evaluated then randomized to initiate cART (efavirenz, tenofovir, and either emtricitabine or lamivudine) vs. cART+ (cART plus raltegravir and maraviroc) during acute HIV and re-evaluated at 4, 12 and 24 weeks. We examined plasma and CSF cytokines, HIV RNA levels, neurological and neuropsychological findings, and brain MRS across groups and compared to healthy controls. Results At baseline, 62 participants were in Fiebig stages I-V. Randomized groups were similar for mean age (27 vs. 25, p = 0.137), gender (each 94% male), plasma log10 HIV RNA (5.4 vs. 5.6, p = 0.382), CSF log10 HIV RNA (2.35 vs. 3.31, p = 0.561), and estimated duration of HIV (18 vs. 17 days, p = 0.546). Randomized arms did not differ at 24 weeks by any CNS outcome. Combining arms, all measures concurrent with antiretroviral treatment improved, for example, neuropsychological testing (mean NPZ-4 of -0.408 vs. 0.245, p<0.001) and inflammatory markers by MRS (e.g. mean frontal white matter (FWM) choline of 2.92 vs. 2.84, p = 0.045) at baseline and week 24, respectively. Plasma neopterin (p<0.001) and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) (p = 0.007) remained elevated in participants compared to controls but no statistically significant differences were seen in CSF cytokines compared to controls, despite individual variability among the HIV-infected group. Conclusions A 24-week course of cART+ improved CNS related outcomes, but was not associated with measurable differences compared to standard cART."
https://openalex.org/W2214810537,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 (LRP5), a co-receptor in the Wnt signaling pathway, modulates bone mass in humans and in mice. Lrp5 knock-out mice have severely impaired responsiveness to mechanical stimulation whereas Lrp5 gain-of-function knock-in and transgenic mice have enhanced responsiveness to mechanical stimulation. Those observations highlight the importance of Lrp5 protein in bone cell mechanotransduction. It is unclear if and how high bone mass-causing (HBM) point mutations in Lrp5 alter the bone-wasting effects of mechanical disuse. To address this issue we explored the skeletal effects of mechanical disuse using two models, tail suspension and Botulinum toxin-induced muscle paralysis, in two different Lrp5 HBM knock-in mouse models. A separate experiment employing estrogen withdrawal-induced bone loss by ovariectomy was also conducted as a control. Both disuse stimuli induced significant bone loss in WT mice, but Lrp5 A214V and G171V were partially or fully protected from the bone loss that normally results from disuse. Trabecular bone parameters among HBM mice were significantly affected by disuse in both models, but these data are consistent with DEXA data showing a failure to continue growing in HBM mice, rather than a loss of pre-existing bone. Ovariectomy in Lrp5 HBM mice resulted in similar protection from catabolism as was observed for the disuse experiments. In conclusion, the Lrp5 HBM alleles offer significant protection from the resorptive effects of disuse and from estrogen withdrawal, and consequently, present a potential mechanism to mimic with pharmaceutical intervention to protect against various bone-wasting stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2137660091,"Understanding the consequences of fragmentation of coastal habitats is an important topic of discussion in marine ecology. Research on the effects of fragmentation has revealed complex and context-dependent biotic responses, which prevent generalizations across different habitats or study organisms. The effects of fragmentation in marine environments have been rarely investigated across heterogeneous habitats, since most studies have focused on a single type of habitat or patch. In this study, we assessed the effects of different levels of fragmentation (i.e. decreasing size of patches without overall habitat loss). We measured these effects using assemblages of macro-invertebrates colonizing representative morphological groups of intertidal macroalgae (e.g. encrusting, turf and canopy-forming algae). For this purpose, we constructed artificial assemblages with different combinations of morphological groups and increasing levels of fragmentation by manipulating the amount of bare rock or the spatial arrangement of different species in mixed assemblages. In general, our results showed that 1) fragmentation did not significantly affect the assemblages of macroinvertebrates; 2) at greater levels of fragmentation, there were greater numbers of species in mixed algal assemblages, suggesting that higher habitat complexity promotes species colonization. Our results suggest that predicting the consequences of fragmentation in heterogeneous habitats is dependent on the type and diversity of morphological groups making up those habitats."

We and others have shown previously that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) improves functional recovery of the rodent heart during reperfusion. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacological induction of hyperinsulinemia in mice down-regulates myocardial UCP3. Decreased UCP3 expression was linked to the development of selective insulin resistance in the heart, characterized by decreased basal activity of Akt but preserved activity of the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and overactivation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1-mediated lipogenic program. In cultured myocytes, insulin treatment and SREBP-1 overexpression decreased, whereas SREBP-1 interference increased, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-stimulated expression of UCP3. Promoter deletion and site-directed mutagenesis identified three functional sterol regulatory elements in the vicinity of a known complex intronic enhancer. Increased binding of SREBP-1 to this DNA region was confirmed in the heart of hyperinsulinemic mice. In conclusion, we describe a hitherto unknown regulatory mechanism by which insulin inhibits cardiac UCP3 expression through activation of the lipogenic factor SREBP-1. Sustained down-regulation of cardiac UCP3 by hyperinsulinemia may partly explain the poor prognosis of type 2 diabetic patients after myocardial infarction."

The aim of the present study is to identify predictors of study attrition in a trial evaluating a perinatal home-visiting program in France.CAPEDP is a French randomized trial comparing a perinatal home-visiting program using psychologists versus usual care (N = 440). The first assessment was at inclusion into the trial at the 27th week of pregnancy and the final assessment when the child reached the age of two. Attrition rates were calculated at 3 and 24 months postpartum. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors of early (between inclusion and 3 months postpartum) and later (between 3 and 24 months postpartum) attrition among social, psychological and parenting factors.Attrition rates were 17% and 63% at 3 and 24 months respectively. At 24 months, there was significantly more attrition in the control arm (70.6%) compared to the intervention arm (55.2%). Five independent predictors of early attrition were identified: having already had an abortion; having greater attachment insecurity as measured with the Vulnerable Attachment Style Questionnaire (VASQ); having lower global severity of psychiatric symptoms as assessed with the Symptom Check-List (SCL-90) at inclusion, being neither currently employed nor studying; and declaring no tobacco consumption during pregnancy. Being randomized into the control arm, having undergone early parental loss before age 11 and having lower global severity of psychiatric symptoms (SCL-90) at 3 months postpartum were the only variables associated with later attrition.This study provides key information for identifying mothers who may require specific support to avoid study attrition in trials evaluating a home-visiting program."

Based on the presenting visual acuity (PVA) in the better-seeing eye, VI was categorized into normal vision (logMAR≤0.30), low vision (logMAR>0.30<1.00), and blindness (logMAR≥1.00). Any VI was defined as low vision/blindness in the PVA of better-seeing eye. Individual-level low-SES was defined as a composite of primary-level education, monthly income<2000 SGD and residing in 1 or 2-room public apartment. An area-level SES was assessed using a socio-economic disadvantage index (SEDI), created using 12 variables from the 2010 Singapore census. A high SEDI score indicates a relatively poor SES. Associations between SES measures and presence and severity of VI were examined using multi-level, mixed-effects logistic and multinomial regression models.The age-adjusted prevalence of any VI was 19.62% (low vision = 19%, blindness = 0.62%). Both individual- and area-level SES were positively associated with any VI and low vision after adjusting for confounders. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of any VI was 2.11(1.88-2.37) for low-SES and 1.07(1.02-1.13) per 1 standard deviation increase in SEDI. When stratified by unilateral/bilateral categories, while low SES showed significant associations with all categories, SEDI showed a significant association with bilateral low vision only. The association between low SES and any VI remained significant among all age, gender and ethnic sub-groups. Although a consistent positive association was observed between area-level SEDI and any VI, the associations were significant among participants aged 40-65 years and male.In this community-based sample of Asian adults, both individual- and area-level SES were independently associated with the presence and severity of VI."
https://openalex.org/W2210835924,"Abalone feeds on brown seaweeds and digests seaweeds' alginate with alginate lyases (EC 4.2.2.3). However, it has been unclear whether the end product of alginate lyases (i.e. unsaturated monouronate-derived 4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (DEH)) is assimilated by abalone itself, because DEH cannot be metabolized via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway of animals. Under these circumstances, we recently noticed the occurrence of an NADPH-dependent reductase, which reduced DEH to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate, in hepatopancreas extract of the pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai. In the present study, we characterized this enzyme to some extent. The DEH reductase, named HdRed in the present study, could be purified from the acetone-dried powder of hepatopancreas by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by conventional column chromatographies. HdRed showed a single band of ∼ 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE and reduced DEH to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate with an optimal temperature and pH at around 50 °C and 7.0, respectively. HdRed exhibited no appreciable activity toward 28 authentic compounds, including aldehyde, aldose, ketose, α-keto-acid, uronic acid, deoxy sugar, sugar alcohol, carboxylic acid, ketone, and ester. The amino acid sequence of 371 residues of HdRed deduced from the cDNA showed 18-60% identities to those of aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily enzymes, such as human aldose reductase, halophilic bacterium reductase, and sea hare norsolorinic acid (a polyketide derivative) reductase-like protein. Catalytic residues and cofactor binding residues known in AKR superfamily enzymes were fairly well conserved in HdRed. Phylogenetic analysis for HdRed and AKR superfamily enzymes indicated that HdRed is an AKR belonging to a novel family."
https://openalex.org/W2134760913,"Background In up to one third of the hospitals in some rural areas of Africa, laboratory services in malaria diagnosis are limited to microscopy by thin film, as no capability to perform thick film exists (gold standard in terms of sensitivity for malaria diagnosis). A new rapid molecular malaria diagnostic test called Loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP) has been recently validated in clinical trials showing exceptional sensitivity and specificity features. It could be a reliable diagnostic tool to be implemented without special equipment or training. Objective The objective of this proof of concept study was to confirm the feasibility of using LAMP technique for diagnosis of malaria in a rural Ethiopian hospital with limited resources. Methodology/Principal Findings This study was carried out in Gambo General Hospital, West Arsi Province (Ethiopia), from November 1st to December 31st 2013. A total of 162 patients with a non-focal febrile syndrome were investigated. The diagnostic capability (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values) of rapid malaria tests and microscopy by thin film was evaluated in comparison with LAMP. Eleven (6.79%) out of the 162 patients with fever and suspected malaria, tested positive for LAMP, 3 (1.85%) for rapid malaria tests and none of the eleven cases was detected by thin film microscopy. Conclusions/Significance LAMP can be performed in basic rural laboratories without the need for specialized infrastructure and it may set a reliable tool for malaria control to detect a low level parasitemia."

A neglected factor in the analysis of community distribution patterns is the multi-scale nature of the data, which has implications for understanding ecological processes and the development of conservation and environmental management practice. Drawing on recently established multivariate spatial analyses, we investigate whether including relationships between spatial structure and abiotic variables enable us to better discern patterns of species and communities across scales. Data comprised 1200 macrozoobenthic samples collected over an array of distances (30 cm to 1 km) in three New Zealand harbours, as well as commonly used abiotic variables, such as sediment characteristics and chlorophyll a concentrations, measured at the same scales. Moran's eigenvector mapping was used to extract spatial scales at which communities were structured. Benthic communities, representing primarily bivalves, polychaetes and crustaceans, were spatially structured at four spatial scales, i.e. >100 m, 50-100 m, 50-15 m, and < 15 m. A broad selection of abiotic variables contributed to the large-scale variation, whereas a more limited set explained part of the fine-scale community structure. Across all scales, less than 30% of the variation in spatial structure was captured by our analysis. The large number of species (48) making up the 10 highest species scores based on redundancy analyses illustrate the variability of species-scale associations. Our results emphasise that abiotic variables and biodiversity are related at all scales investigated and stress the importance of assessing the relationship between environmental variables and the abundance and distribution of biological assemblages across a range of different scales."
https://openalex.org/W2271382068,"HCN channels play a unique role in bilaterian physiology as the only hyperpolarization-gated cation channels. Their voltage-gating is regulated by cyclic nucleotides and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Activation of HCN channels provides the depolarizing current in response to hyperpolarization that is critical for intrinsic rhythmicity in neurons and the sinoatrial node. Additionally, HCN channels regulate dendritic excitability in a wide variety of neurons. Little is known about the early functional evolution of HCN channels, but the presence of HCN sequences in basal metazoan phyla and choanoflagellates, a protozoan sister group to the metazoans, indicate that the gene family predates metazoan emergence. We functionally characterized two HCN channel orthologs from Nematostella vectensis (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) to determine which properties of HCN channels were established prior to the emergence of bilaterians. We find Nematostella HCN channels share all the major functional features of bilaterian HCNs, including reversed voltage-dependence, activation by cAMP and PIP2, and block by extracellular Cs+. Thus bilaterian-like HCN channels were already present in the common parahoxozoan ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians, at a time when the functional diversity of voltage-gated K+ channels was rapidly expanding. NvHCN1 and NvHCN2 are expressed broadly in planulae and in both the endoderm and ectoderm of juvenile polyps."
https://openalex.org/W2273830512,"The pharmacological effect of opioids originates, at the cellular level, by their interaction with the μ-opioid receptor (mOR) resulting in the regulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and inwardly rectifying K+ channels that ultimately modulate the synaptic transmission. Recently, an alternative six trans-membrane helix isoform of mOR, (6TM-mOR) has been identified, but its function and signaling are still largely unknown. Here, we present the structural and functional mechanisms of 6TM-mOR signaling activity upon binding to morphine. Our data suggest that despite the similarity of binding modes of the alternative 6TM-mOR and the dominant seven trans-membrane helix variant (7TM-mOR), the interaction with morphine generates different dynamic responses in the two receptors, thus, promoting the activation of different mOR-specific signaling pathways. We characterize a series of 6TM-mOR-specific cellular responses, and observed that they are significantly different from those for 7TM-mOR. Morphine stimulation of 6TM-mOR does not promote a cellular cAMP response, while it increases the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and reduces the cellular K+ conductance. Our findings indicate that 6TM-mOR has a unique contribution to the cellular opioid responses. Therefore, it should be considered as a relevant target for the development of novel pharmacological tools and medical protocols involving the use of opioids."
https://openalex.org/W2118768029,"This study evaluated how the proportional area of natural habitat surrounding a vineyard (i.e. landscape diversity) worked in conjunction with crop vigor, cultivar and rootstock selection to influence biological control of the western grape leafhopper (Erythroneura elegantula Osborn). The key natural enemies of E. elegantula are Anagrus erythroneurae S. Trjapitzin & Chiappini and A. daanei Triapitsyn, both of which are likely impacted by changes in landscape diversity due to their reliance on non-crop habitat to successfully overwinter. Additionally, E. elegantula is sensitive to changes in host plant quality which may influence densities on specific cultivars, rootstocks and/or vines with increased vigor. From 2010–2013, data were collected on natural enemy and leafhopper densities, pest parasitism rates and vine vigor from multiple vineyards that represented a continuum of landscape diversity. Early in the season, vineyards in more diverse landscapes had higher Anagrus spp. densities and lower E. elegantula densities, which led to increased parasitism of E. elegantula. Although late season densities of E. elegantula tended to be lower in vineyards with higher early season parasitism rates and lower total petiole nitrogen content, they were also affected by rootstock and cultivar. While diverse landscapes can support higher natural enemy populations, which can lead to increased biological control, leafhopper densities also appear to be mediated by cultivar, rootstock and vine vigor."

The median CD4 cell count was 126 cells/mm3. Overall 257 (85%) patients started ART during RR-TB treatment, 33 (11%) within 2 weeks, 152 (50%) between 2-8 weeks and 72 (24%) after 8 weeks. Of the 46 (15%) who never started ART, 10 (21%) died or stopped RR-TB treatment within 4 weeks and 16 (37%) had at least 4 months of RR-TB treatment. Treatment success and mortality during treatment did not vary by time to ART initiation: treatment success was 41%, 43%, and 50% among patients who started ART within 2 weeks, between 2-8 weeks, and after 8 weeks (p = 0.62), while mortality was 21%, 13% and 15% respectively (p = 0.57). Mortality was associated with never receiving ART (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 6.0, CI 2.1-18.1), CD4 count ≤100 (aHR 2.1, CI 1.0-4.5), and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) with second-line resistance (aHR 2.5, CI 1.1-5.4).Despite wide variation in time to ART initiation among RR-TB patients, no differences in mortality or treatment success were observed. However, a significant proportion of patients did not initiate ART despite receiving >4 months of RR-TB treatment. Programmatic priorities should focus on ensuring all patients with RR-TB/HIV co-infection initiate ART regardless of CD4 count, with special attention for patients with CD4 counts ≤ 100 to initiate ART as soon as possible after RR-TB treatment initiation."

The first case of human infection with H9N2 viruses in Hunan province of China have been confirmed in November 2013 and identified that H9N2 viruses from live poultry markets (LPMs) near the patient’s house could be the source of infection. However, the prevalence, distribution and genetic characteristics of H9N2 viruses in LPMs all over the province are not clear. We collected and tested 3943 environmental samples from 380 LPMs covering all 122 counties/districts of Hunan province from February to April, 2014. A total of 618 (15.7%) samples were H9 subtype positive and 200 (52.6%) markets in 98 (80.3%) counties/districts were contaminated with H9 subtype AIVs. We sequenced the entire coding sequences of the genomes of eleven H9N2 isolates from environmental samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the gene sequences of the H9N2 AIVs exhibited high homology (94.3%-100%). All eleven viruses were in a same branch in the phylogenetic trees and belonged to a same genotype. No gene reassortment had been found.

https://openalex.org/W2259160123,"Despite considerable research and programmatic efforts to alleviate racial/ethnic disparities in physical activity (PA), disparities in PA among older minorities and major racial ethnic groups persist. This study explored perceptions of PA among regularly active (RA) and insufficiently active (IA) older African American women (AAW) and the factors that influence (positively and negatively) their physical participation in their socio-cultural environment. A total of 20 AAW aged 60 to 80 years participated in a cross-sectional mixed-methods study (i.e., qualitative and quantitative) employing participatory research approaches (i.e., photoelicitation) along with an objective assessment of PA. Nine women were considered RA and 11 IA according to current PA recommendations. RA and IA women held two major beliefs about the nature of PA (i.e., PA as a broadly defined construct that goes beyond traditional exercise routines; and PA and exercise are synonymous and can be used interchangeably) and had a good understanding of its benefits. Participants in both groups did not know about the importance of PA intensity for health benefits. Barriers and facilitator of PA were found to be similar among RA and IA participants. Special attention should be paid to providing access to no or low cost opportunities for PA participation in safe environments."
https://openalex.org/W2139910473,"VGF mRNA is induced in specific hypothalamic areas of the Siberian hamster upon exposure to short photoperiods, which is associated with a seasonal decrease in appetite and weight loss. Processing of VGF generates multiple bioactive peptides, so the objective of this study was to determine the profile of the VGF-derived peptides in the brain, pituitary and plasma from Siberian hamsters, and to establish whether differential processing might occur in the short day lean state versus long day fat. Antisera against short sequences at the C- or N- termini of proVGF, as well as against NERP-1, TPGH and TLQP peptides, were used for analyses of tissues, and both immunohistochemistry and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) coupled with high-performance liquid (HPLC) or gel chromatography were carried out. VGF peptide immunoreactivity was found within cortex cholinergic perikarya, in multiple hypothalamic nuclei, including those containing vasopressin, and in pituitary gonadotrophs. ELISA revealed that exposure to short day photoperiod led to a down-regulation of VGF immunoreactivity in the cortex, and a less pronounced decrease in the hypothalamus and pituitary, while the plasma VGF levels were not affected by the photoperiod. HPLC and gel chromatography both confirmed the presence of multiple VGF-derived peptides in these tissues, while gel chromatography showed the presence of the VGF precursor in all tissues tested except for the cortex. These observations are consistent with the view that VGF-derived peptides have pleiotropic actions related to changing photoperiod, possibly by regulating cholinergic systems in the cortex, vasopressin hypothalamic pathways, and the reproductive axis."
https://openalex.org/W2164164360,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) is a serpin inhibitor of the plasminogen activators urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator, which binds tightly to the clearance and signaling receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in both proteinase-complexed and uncomplexed forms. Binding sites for PAI-1 within LRP1 have been localized to CR clusters II and IV. Within cluster II, there is a strong preference for the triple CR domain fragment CR456. Previous mutagenesis studies to identify the binding site on PAI-1 for LRP1 have given conflicting results or implied small binding contributions incompatible with the high affinity PAI-1/LRP1 interaction. Using a highly sensitive solution fluorescence assay, we have examined binding of CR456 to arginine and lysine variants of PAI-1 and definitively identified the binding site as composed of four basic residues, Lys-69, Arg-76, Lys-80, and Lys-88. These are highly conserved among mammalian PAI-1s. Individual mutations result in a 13–800-fold increase in Kd values. We present evidence that binding involves engagement of CR4 by Lys-88, CR5 by Arg-76 and Lys-80, and CR6 by Lys-69, with the strongest interactions to CR5 and CR6. Collectively, the individual binding contributions account quantitatively for the overall PAI-1/LRP1 affinity. We propose that the greater efficiency of PAI-1·uPA complex binding and clearance by LRP1, compared with PAI-1 alone, is due solely to simultaneous binding of the uPA moiety in the complex to its receptor, thereby making binding of the PAI-1 moiety to LRP1 a two-dimensional surface-localized association.

Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) 2The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; CRx, complement-type repeat x, with numbering of x relating to the position of the domain within LRP1 from the N terminus; CR5F6W, CR5W6, and CR5F6F, CR56 species in which the tryptophan(s) in CR5, CR6, or both, respectively, have been changed to phenylalanine; -ME, -mercaptoethanol; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; RAP, receptor-associated protein; TEV, tobacco etch virus; uPAR, uPA receptor; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; IAEDANS, 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl) amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid. is one of two serine proteinases involved in cell surface generation of plasmin from plasminogen. Although plasmin's primary role is to degrade fibrin-containing thrombi, it is also involved in a wide range of other normal and pathological processes that result from its ability to cleave matrix proteins such as laminin and fibronectin. In this way regulation of uPA activity plays an important role in control of processes such as wound healing and angiogenesis, as well as the growth and dissemination of tumors. For example, inhibition of uPA activity has been shown to block tumor invasion in the nude mouse (1Ossowski L. Russo-Payne H. Wilson E.L. Inhibition of urokinase-type plasminogen activator by antibodies: the effect on dissemination of a human tumor in the nude mouse.Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 274-281PubMed Google Scholar). uPA is localized to the cell surface by tight binding to its uPA receptor (uPAR) (2Blasi F. Carmeliet P. uPAR: a versatile signalling orchestrator.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 932-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) through the N-terminal region of uPA (3Huai Q. Zhou A.

Biol. 2012; 416: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The principal inhibitor of uPA activity is plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a serpin. Inhibition by serpins involves a unique mechanism of kinetic trapping of the acyl-enzyme intermediate formed during cleavage of the serpin's reactive center loop by the proteinase (5Gettins P.G. Serpin structure, mechanism and function.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). The mechanism involves a massive conformational change in the serpin, with insertion of the reactive center loop into sheet A of the serpin and translocation and consequent distortion of the proteinase active site as the means of kinetic trapping (6Stratikos E.

Structure of a serpin-protease complex shows inhibition by deformation.Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Because uPA is predominantly bound to its receptor, the result of inhibition by PAI-1 is the formation of a ternary membrane-associated uPAR·uPA·PAI-1 complex. This complex is rapidly internalized, as a result of binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1), and the uPA·PAI-1 component degraded (10Olson D. Pöllänen J.

In contrast, uPA alone bound to uPAR is poorly internalized (12Nykjaer A. Kjøller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd 3rd., R.F. van Zonneveld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A.

Cross-competition for binding to LRP1 between uPA·PAI-1 complexes and PAI-1 complexes with other proteinases suggests that much or all of the binding interaction between the uPAR·uPA·PAI-1 complex and LRP1 occurs through PAI-1 (13Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Additional support for this comes from soluble uPAR blocking the binding of uPA to LRP1, although it has minimal effect on the strength of the uPA·PAI-1 interaction with LRP1 (12Nykjaer A. Kjøller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd 3rd., R.F. van Zonneveld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A.

Knowledge of the binding site on PAI-1 for LRP1 is thus very important for an understanding of the structural basis for internalization and degradation of uPA in its PAI-1-complexed form and hence for regulation of surface-bound uPA activity. However, no structure of PAI-1 in complex with a fragment of LRP1 has yet been determined. Indeed, the only structures of complex between a protein ligand and a receptor fragment from an LDL receptor family member are of human rhinovirus HRV2 bound to a portion of the VLDL receptor (14Verdaguer N. Fita I. Reithmayer M. Moser R. Blaas D. X-ray structure of a minor group human rhinovirus bound to a fragment of its cellular receptor protein.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), of the third domain of RAP bound to a fragment from LDL receptor (15Fisher C. Beglova N. Blacklow S.C.

Structural basis for specific recognition of reelin by its receptors.Structure. 2010; 18: 320-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These structures suggest a common theme of engagement of protein ligands by LDL receptor family members that involves binding of pairs of basic residues (lysine in each case) to individual CR domains of the respective receptors. These CR domains are small independent modules that occur in clusters within the receptors. This mode of binding is qualitatively consistent with mutagenesis studies carried out on PAI-1, in which mutation of certain basic residues reduced binding affinity for LRP1, either alone or in complex with proteinase (13Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A.

However, there are two major problems with these mutagenesis studies. The most disconcerting is that basic residues identified as being involved in binding result in no more that an 11-fold increase in Kd when mutated and mostly much less, whereas the affinity of PAI-1 for LRP1 is in the low nanomolar region. Such very small effects are not expected if basic residues are the dominant contributors to overall affinity, which has been quantitatively shown to be the case for the RAP D3/CR56 interaction (21Dolmer K. Campos A. Gettins P.G. Quantitative dissection of the binding contributions of ligand lysines of the receptor-associated protein (RAP) to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1).J. Biol.

A proximal pair of positive charges provides the dominant ligand-binding contribution to complement-like domains from the LRP (low density lipoprotein-related receptor).Biochem. J. 2012; 443: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The second problem is that there is no consensus on which basic residues constitute the binding site, with some residues identified as being important in one study (13Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 contains a cryptic high affinity binding site for the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.J. Biol.

To more definitively establish the binding site on PAI-1 for LRP1, we have developed a sensitive fluorescence assay and examined the solution binding of wild type and variant PAI-1s, all in their native form, to the fragment CR456 from LRP1, which we and others have shown to be a high affinity binding site for PAI-1 and its proteinase complexes within cluster II of LRP1 (23Horn I.R. van den Berg B.M. van der Meijden P.Z.

All PAI-1 species used were on the stable 14-1B (the very stable variant of PAI-1 containing four stabilizing mutations (N150H, K154T, Q319L, and M354I) (26Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Molecular evolution of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 functional stability.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) background that has been shown not to alter the functional properties of PAI-1, but it does greatly slow the conversion to the latent state (26Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Molecular evolution of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 functional stability.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent use here of the term WT PAI-1 implies the 14-1B background. An estimate of the t½ for conversion to the latent state at 4 °C, based on t½ at 25 °C of 22 h (27Blouse G.E. Perron M.J.

Mutation of the conserved tryptophan in the serpin breach region alters the inhibitory mechanism of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and an activation energy for the latent transition of 96 kJ mol−1 (28Florova G. Karandashova S. Declerck P.J. Idell S. Komissarov A.A. Remarkable stabilization of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in a “molecular sandwich” complex.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 4697-4709Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), is well over 200 days for WT PAI-1 and would be very much longer for the 14-1B variant. For the 14-1B variant used here, the protein thus remains completely in the native state, even when kept at 4 °C for several days. The cDNA encoding the 14-1B variant was cloned into pQE30 (29Jensen J.K. Gettins P.G. High-resolution structure of the stable plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 variant 14-1B in its proteinase-cleaved form: a new tool for detailed interaction studies and modeling.Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) giving a final product containing an N-terminal His6 tag. ΔW-PAI-1 (PAI-1 with all four tryptophans mutated to phenylalanine) was generated by sequentially mutating the four tryptophans (residues 86, 139, 175, and 262) to phenylalanine. For FRET measurements, single cysteine variants were generated on the ΔW-PAI-1 background (H2C, G70C, G84C, S127C, G194C, G230C, G264C, and Q312C). For monitoring binding of LRP1 fragments from fluorescence perturbation, the H2C mutation was introduced into PAI-1 14-1B and used as the background to generate the following variants: K65A, K69A, K65A/K69A, R76A, K80A, R76A/K80A, K88A, K176A, K88A/K176A, and R115A/R118A. All mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange protocol (Agilent Technologies), and all variants were verified by DNA sequencing before protein expression. PAI-1 variants were expressed in SG13009 cells (Qiagen) in 2YT medium. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.6–1.0 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and the temperature was then lowered to 27 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 4–5 h and stored at −80 °C until needed. PAI-1 variants were purified as described (30Jensen J.K. Wind T. Andreasen P.A. The vitronectin binding area of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, mapped by mutagenesis and protection against an inactivating organochemical ligand.FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells were sonicated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm β-ME. After centrifugation, NaCl and glycerol were added to 2 m and 5% v/v, respectively. The cleared lysate was loaded on a Ni2+-chelate column. PAI-1 was eluted with 250 mm imidazole and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0, containing 14 mm β-ME. DTT was added to 5 mm before final purification on a Superdex 75 column (860 × 16 mm), with elution in dialysis buffer. The effect of the lysine or arginine to alanine mutations on PAI-1 function was determined by assessing the ability of the PAI-1 variants to inhibit uPA. Both stoichiometries of inhibition and apparent second order rate constants were determined by kinetic assay. For all of the variants, the stoichiometries of inhibition and corrected second order rate constants were very similar to those of WT PAI-1, consistent with the alanine substitutions not affecting the structure of the molecule. The peak containing monomeric PAI-1 was made 10 mm in DTT, concentrated to 1.5–2.5 ml using Amicon ultracentrifugal filters, and buffer-exchanged into degassed 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0, using a Sephadex G25F column (160 × 16 mm). The protein concentration was determined using UV absorption at 280 nm and calculated extinction coefficients of 35,410 m−1 cm−1 for WT PAI-1, and 13,410 m−1 cm−1 for ΔW-PAI-1. Two molar eq of DTT were added to the PAI-1 sample, followed by the addition of 12 eq of IAEDANS (Molecular Probes). The reaction was allowed to proceed on ice overnight. The next day, the reaction was quenched by adding 14 mm β-ME, and the sample was concentrated to 1.5–2.5 ml before excess IAEDANS was removed by G25F gel filtration. After concentrating the samples, the concentrations of PAI-1 and dansyl were determined spectrophotometrically, using an extinction coefficient of 4700 m−1 cm−1 at 340 nm for dansyl and a correction factor of 0.38 for the absorption at 280 nm (A280, corr = A280 − 0.38 × A340). Samples typically contained 50–100 μm PAI-1 and 1.3–1.5 dansyl per PAI-1. A control PAI-1 sample, without cysteine, was reacted similarly and gave 0.3 dansyl per PAI-1. This nonspecific dansyl label was insensitive to binding of LRP1 fragments. Expression, purification, and refolding of the various CR fragments was according to procedures we have successfully used for many years (25Jensen J.K. Dolmer K. Gettins P.G.

Cells were grown to A600 = 0.6–1.0 before induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and harvested after 5–6 h at 37 °C. The GST fusion proteins were purified from cleared cell lysate by GSH-Sepharose chromatography, and the GST tag was removed by TEV proteinase cleavage during overnight dialysis against 4 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, containing 14 mm β-ME. GST and uncleaved GST-CR fusion proteins were removed by passage through the GSH column. CR345 and CR456 were cloned into pQE-30, modified to contain a GB1 fusion partner (for increased solubility), and a TEV proteinase cleavage site. These His6-tagged fusion proteins were expressed in SG13009 cells containing the plasmid pRARE. The CR fusion proteins were purified from cell lysate by Ni2+-chelate chromatography, and the fusion partners were removed by TEV proteinase cleavage during overnight dialysis against PBS containing 14 mm β-ME. Before refolding, all CRs were further purified by Q-Sepharose HP chromatography, using a gradient of 0–1000 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 6 m urea. The denatured CRs were diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 8.5, containing 14 mm β-ME and 8 mm 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (refolding buffer). For increased folding efficiency, all CR constructs were mixed with the chaperone RAP as a GST fusion protein (GST-RAP) at a 1:1 ratio. Final CR concentration in the refolding mixture was 0.1 mg/ml. The CR species were refolded by dialysis against refolding buffer for 24 h at room temperature with N2 bubbling, followed by 24 h at 4 °C without N2. Finally, the mixture was dialyzed twice against 4 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C. The refolding mixture was loaded on GSH-Sepharose, and folded CR constructs, i.e. those capable of binding to RAP and therefore retained on the column, were eluted with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm EDTA. Folded CR constructs were further purified by Q-Sepharose HP chromatography by salt gradient elution with 50–1000 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. If traces of GST-RAP were still present, calcium was removed from the mixture by adding EDTA, and the mixture was passed through a Superdex 75 size exclusion column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 4 mm EDTA, after which calcium was reintroduced to the purified CR. As a quality control between each step of purification, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (with and without reducing agent) and native-PAGE. The presence of a single band on SDS-PAGE, which shifts upon reduction, indicates homogeneous samples with formed disulfide bridges. A single band on native-PAGE suggests the presence of a single folding product. The final product was judged by SDS-PAGE to be more than 95% pure. The effective concentration of functional CR fragments was determined by stoichiometric titration against RAP fragment D3. Binding was monitored from the shift in tryptophan fluorescence maximum of the CR domains upon binding and the high affinity of D3 for all of the CR fragments used here (31Jensen J.K. Dolmer K.

GST-RAP was expressed in BL21 cells, induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at A600 = 0.6–1.0, and harvested after 5 h at 25 °C. GST-RAP was purified by GSH-Sepharose chromatography. GST-RAP was then dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, containing 14 mm β-ME. Free cysteines in the GST moiety were blocked by treatment with 20 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature, and excess reagent was removed by dialyzing twice against 4 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, followed by dialysis against 4 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2. All fluorescence measurements were made on a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorimeter, equipped with double monochromators on both excitation and emission sides. For FRET measurements, excitation was at 280 nm and emission was monitored from 310 to 650 nm. For direct contact perturbation spectra excitation was at 342 nm and spectra were recorded from 400 to 650 nm.

Collective data from x-ray crystallographic studies of hMGL and bacterial MGL variants have allowed inference that the lid subdomain shows a high degree of conformational plasticity along a coordinate of catalytic activity and suggest the existence of a stochastic equilibrium that transitions the enzyme between open- and closed-lid conformations. Nonetheless, there are limits with which even a suite of static x-ray maps per se can reflect the conformational flexibility of a protein and structural influences on protein function (11Turner N.A. Needs E.C. Khan J.A. Vulfson E.N. Analysis of conformational states of Candida rugosa lipase in solution: implications for mechanism of interfacial activation and separation of open and closed forms.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 72: 108-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concern is underscored by the important roles that protein structural transitions play in enzyme catalysis and the influence of targeted ligands thereon as prospective drugs (12Xu T. Liu L. Hou S. Xu J. Yang B. Wang Y. Liu J. Crystal structure of a mono- and diacylglycerol lipase from Malassezia globosa reveals a novel lid conformation and insights into the substrate specificity.J.

In this regard our previous work has demonstrated the effects of important interactions on hMGL structure, substrate affinity, and/or activity. These interactions include hMGL membrane association (14Nasr M.L. Shi X. Bowman A.L. Johnson M. Zvonok N. Janero D.R. Vemuri V.K. Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Makriyannis A.

The structural effects of these interactions are not restricted to the hMGL lid domain but are also to discrete non-lid enzyme regions as well (14Nasr M.L. Shi X. Bowman A.L. Johnson M. Zvonok N. Janero D.R. Vemuri V.K. Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Makriyannis A.

Biosyst. 2010; 6: 1381-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Perhaps most strikingly, we identified by NMR a strong hydrogen bond network and provisionally implicated His-269 and Asp-239 of the catalytic triad and neighboring Leu-241 and Cys-242 residues therein. Not only did this hydrogen bond network influence catalytic activity but active site-directed inhibitors of different types were observed to alter this population of hydrogen bonds in concert with their inhibitory activity (15Karageorgos I. Tyukhtenko S. Zvonok N. Janero D.R. Sallum C. Makriyannis A.

The influence of noncovalent amino acid interactions in regulating protein conformational transitions, protein ligand binding architecture, and ligand pharmacological activity is a topic of great current interest. For hMGL, the factors leading to conformational transitions of the enzyme are not well defined, and the effects of specific intramolecular amino acid interactions on the hMGL catalytic efficiency have not been measured. Unlike other lipases (8Mala J.G. Takeuchi S. Understanding structural features of microbial lipases: an overview.Anal. Chem. Insights. 2008; 3: 9-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Turner N.A. Needs E.C. Khan J.A. Vulfson E.N.

It can, therefore, be utilized to determine important molecular details such as understanding hydrogen bond networks within an enzyme molecule that affect protein architecture and catalysis. We demonstrate here simultaneous NMR detection of both active and inactive hMGL states in solution and report the unambiguous assignment of downfield NMR resonances that are highly sensitive to the equilibrium between these two states. These resonances of equal integral intensity represent the hydrogen-bonding pattern of the active conformer that is predominant at neutral pH. Significant changes in the intensities of the peaks with pH, temperature, or point mutations are indicative of alterations of this hydrogen-bonding pattern when the equilibrium is shifted toward the inactive state. The well-appreciated role of hydrogen bonds as determinants of protein structure suggests that the hMGL inactivation observed reflects enzyme conformational changes that have their origin in the altered hydrogen-bonding network. The ability of the perturbations in the downfield region of the hMGL NMR spectra to be elicited in a predictable manner from different changes to physical conditions implies the existence of a regulated equilibrium between distinct enzyme conformations. The activity of hMGL may be modulated by structural determinants that can transition the enzyme between open-closed conformations. Single (hMGL-H269A), double (hMGL-L169S,L176S) (sol-hMGL), several triple hMGL mutants (sol-hMGL-H49A, sol-hMGL-H54A, sol-hMGL-H103A, sol-hMGL-H75A, sol-hMGL-S122C, sol-hMGL-H272Y, sol-hMGL-H272A, sol-hMGL-H272S), and sol-hMGL-H269A,S122C were generated using corresponding primers and Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (La Jolla, CA). All hMGL variants were generated as His6-tagged proteins to facilitate their purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The DNA primary structure of all mutants was confirmed by sequencing. The hMGL mutants were expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells, as previously detailed (17Zvonok N. Pandarinathan L. Williams J. Johnston M. Karageorgos I. Janero D.R. Krishnan S.C. Makriyannis A.

Biol. 2008; 15: 854-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, a single E. coli colony containing the plasmids with appropriate hMGL gene mutations was inoculated into 10 ml of Luria broth/ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown overnight at 33 °C with shaking (250 rpm). The next morning these 10 ml were inoculated into 500 ml of Luria broth/ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and allowed to grow at 33 °C with shaking (250 rpm) until the culture reached an A600 of 0.6–0.8. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fisher) to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 5 h of induction at 30 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and held at −80 °C. Uniformly 15N-labeled sol-hMGL samples were prepared using the same procedure incorporating minimal media containing 15NH4Cl, and uniformly 13C-labeled samples were prepared in minimal media with [U-13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). For enzyme purification, 3 g (wet weight) of cells were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.4) and 20 ml of xTractor buffer (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) supplemented with lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) and DNase I (25 μg/ml) (Fisher). After 20 min the lysate was disrupted on ice by three 1-min sonication cycles, each consisting of 1-s sonication bursts at a 50-watt power level separated by a 5-s interval (Vibra-Cell 500 W, Sonics, Newtown, CT). The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 20, 000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. hMGL was isolated by incubating the resulting supernatant with 4.0 ml (bed volume) pre-equilibrated Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) for 1 h at 4 °C. This suspension was transferred to a gravity-flow column and allowed to settle. The resin was washed twice with 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, and His-tagged hMGL was eluted with 12 ml of lysis buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Protein purity was evaluated using Any kDa Mini-PROTEAN TGX SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were denatured at 70 °C for 5 min in Laemmli buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fisher). Before enzyme assays and NMR experiments, purified hMGL samples were dialyzed for 12 h to ensure thorough imidazole removal using a membrane with a molecular mass cutoff of 10,000–12,000 Da. Enzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the molar extinction coefficient ϵ280 24,910 m−1 cm−1. Our sample preparation protocol routinely yields sol-hMGL in the active conformation. Over time the active conformer undergoes spontaneous conformational switching to an inactive state. The spontaneous transition between the two states is extremely slow, suggestive of a high energy barrier for the switch in our sol-MGL variant. The active conformer is stable for several weeks at room temperature. At 310 K the transition rate is faster. Incubation of the sample at 310 K for several days resulted in a complete transition to the inactive form. This enabled us to prepare distinct sol-hMGL conformers for NMR analysis. The endogenous hMGL substrate, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), was used for the determination of catalytic parameters (Km, Vmax, Kcat). Hydrolysis of 2-AG to arachidonic acid (AA) by hMGL was monitored and quantified by HPLC. Briefly, 280 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) was preincubated with 15 μl of each 2-AG stock dilution (final 2-AG concentrations, 13–400 μm), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of purified hMGL (18 ng–1 μg). Aliquots (50 μl) were taken immediately at the start of the incubation and after 20 min diluted 4-fold by volume with chilled acetonitrile to quench enzyme activity and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatant (20 μl) was injected directly into a Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC system for analysis. In an 8-min run, 2-AG eluted at 3.0 min and AA at 4.0 min, allowing the reaction to be followed by either substrate (2-AG) turnover or product (AA) formation. A gradient elution profile of 5% B (water/acetonitrile/orthophosphoric acid = 54/40/6%) to 100% A (acetonitrile) at a 1 ml/min flow rate was used for separation on a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 reverse-phase (4.6 × 50 mm, 3.5 μm) column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Analytes were quantified with external standards. The rate of AA formation was determined by subtracting the AA concentration at t = 0 from that at t = 20 min. Initial rates of 2-AG hydrolysis at the various substrate concentrations were determined. Vmax and Km values were then estimated by fitting the initial-rate data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism 5.0 (San Diego, CA). All assays were performed in triplicate. Samples used for NMR analyses were 0.1–0.4 mm hMGL in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% sodium azide, 95% H2O, 5% D2O at specified pH values. Sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was added (∼20 μm) as an internal chemical shift reference (δ = 0.00 ppm). Sample volume was 0.6 ml. The pH was adjusted as desired by the addition of microliter amounts of 0.1 m HCl or NaOH and measured using a Wilmad Labglass pH electrode (3-mm outer diameter × 180-mm length) inserted into the protein solution in the 5-mm NMR tube at room temperature before and after NMR data collection. NMR spectra were recorded at 16 pH values between pH 6.5 and pH 12 for sol-hMGL because the enzyme precipitated below pH 6. Ligand binding experiments were carried out using a 50 mm stock solution of paraoxon (diethyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphate), dissolved in DMSO-d6 (18Crow J.A. Bittles V. Herring K.L. Borazjani A. Potter P.M. Ross M.K. Inhibition of recombinant human carboxylesterase 1 and 2 and monoacylglycerol lipase by chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon, and methyl paraoxon.Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2012; 258: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Typically, no more than 5 μl of paraoxon solution was added to each enzyme sample to achieve a concentration of paraoxon twice that of the enzyme. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 700 MHz with a Bruker AVANCE II NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance inverse probe at 37 °C.

This pulse sequence employs a binomial-like pulse train that provides null excitation at the water frequency. The center of the maximal excitation region was 13.9 ppm, and the calculated delay for binomial water suppression was 39 μs at 700 MHz. In combination with a flipback pulse, the 3-9-19 sequence significantly prevents unwanted attenuation of downfield resonances from spin diffusion and chemical exchange with water. Routinely, 8-K scans were accumulated. The 1H,15N Fast-HSQC (20Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zijl P.C.

B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) spectrum of uniformly 15N-labeled sol-hMGL was recorded using a spectral width of 30 ppm and 140 ppm in 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. The 1H transmitter was set to the frequency of the water resonance, and the 15N carrier frequency was set to 175 ppm to achieve maximum intensity for the histidine side chain resonances. Regular 1H,15N HSQC and 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectra were recorded using standard pulse sequences supplied with the AVANCE 700 spectrometer. All NMR data were processed with TopSpin software (Bruker). For one-dimensional spectra, exponential multiplication (broadening factor lb = 20 Hz) was applied. Recombinant wild-type hMGL required detergents during purification to maintain stability and prevent aggregation in concentrated solutions >100 μm. Aggregation of wt-hMGL resulted in significant broadening of NMR resonance peaks and protein precipitation. To avoid the need for detergents and obviate enzyme aggregation/precipitation, a DNA construct expressing a soluble hMGL variant with two leucines substituted by two serines in the lid subdomain (double mutant L169S,L176S) (sol-hMGL) was expressed and used in this study (6Schalk-Hihi C. Schubert C. Alexander R. Bayoumy S. Clemente J.C. Deckman I. DesJarlais R.L. Dzordzorme K.C. Flores C.M. Grasberger B. Kranz J.K. Lewandowski F. Liu L. Ma H. Maguire D. Macielag M.J. McDonnell M.E. Mezzasalma Haarlander T. Miller R. Milligan C. Reynolds C. Kuo L.C. Crystal structure of a soluble form of human monoglyceride lipase in complex with an inhibitor at 1.35 A resolution.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 670-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These substitutions resulted in a modest decrease in enzyme catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) from 2.2 × 105 to 2.5 × 104 μm−1s−1 and no change in substrate affinity (respective Km values: 25 ± 6 and 22 ± 4 μm). Thus, hMGL function was not significantly compromised by these mutations, suggesting that overall enzyme conformation was also not adversely affected. This construct (310 amino acids, 34.1 kDa) formed the basis for introducing additional mutations to allow residue assignment of downfield NMR resonances. Sol-hMGL and mutants exhibited greater solubility and stability, overcoming aggregation issues and providing sharp NMR resonances (data not shown). A striking feature of the hMGL one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum is the downfield region (12–18 ppm) that exhibits four well resolved labile proton resonances (Fig. 1A). These signals are detectable with 15N chemical shifts in the range of 160–180 ppm, as shown in the partial 1H,15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. 1B), and consequently correspond to nitrogen-bonded imidazole resonances from histidines (21Bachovchin W.W. Wong W.Y. Farr-Jones S. Shenvi A.B. Kettner C.A. Nitrogen-15 NMR spectroscopy of the catalytic-triad histidine of a serine protease in peptide boronic acid inhibitor complexes.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7689-7697Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The extreme downfield chemical shift of these protein resonances is a consequence of their participation in hydrogen-bonding interactions with neighboring residues (22Bachovchin W.W. Confirmation of the assignment of the low-field proton resonance of serine proteases by using specifically nitrogen-15 labeled enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 7948-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 1H NMR signals for catalytic His protons involved in hydrogen bonds in the active sites of serine proteases have been observed in the range of 12–19 ppm (23Bachovchin W.W. Contributions of NMR spectroscopy to the study of hydrogen bonds in serine protease active sites.Magn. Reson. Chem. 2001; 39: S199-S213Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On this basis we had provisionally assigned one signal in the downfield region to an H-bond between the catalytic His-269 and Asp-239 of hMGL. To assign experimentally and definitively hMGL His resonance peaks and define intramolecular details affecting hMGL function, we conducted single-point mutations of specific amino acid residues. Our rationale was based upon the concept that disappearance of a resonance in the downfield region of the NMR spectrum upon substitution of a given His residue by Ala would provide definitive mutagenesis-based resonance assignment (Fig. 1A). To assign the catalytic His residue, a variant of sol-hMGL was prepared by substituting His-269 with alanine. As a consequence of removal of the side-chain H-bond donor from the active site in this H269A mutant, only the downfield NMR signal at 14.9 ppm disappeared, whereas all other signals in the sol-hMGL downfield region remained unchanged (Fig. 1A). Thus, the peak observed at 14.9 ppm corresponds to the His-269 Hδ1 proton that is hydrogen-bonded to Asp-239 in the hMGL Ser-122–His-269–Asp-239 catalytic triad (Fig. 2A). This chemical shift of catalytic histidine resonances in serine proteases has been shown to be highly dependent upon histidine protonation state and enzyme conformation (23Bachovchin W.W. Contributions of NMR spectroscopy to the study of hydrogen bonds in serine protease active sites.Magn. Reson. Chem. 2001; 39: S199-S213Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Seemingly minor changes in pH can readily change the His charge state and, consequently, the chemical shift of Hδ1 proton. In serine proteases, a doubly protonated (positively charged) active site His imidazole ring demonstrates that Hδ1 resonances usually shifted downfield to ∼17–19 ppm (23Bachovchin W.W.

https://openalex.org/W2336103539,"Ran (RanGTPase) in insects participates in the 20-hydroxyecdysone signal transduction pathway in which downstream genes, FTZ-F1, Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1) and vitellogenin, are involved. A putative Ran gene (NlRan) was cloned from Nilaparvata lugens, a destructive phloem-feeding pest of rice. NlRan has the typical Ran primary structure features that are conserved in insects. NlRan showed higher mRNA abundance immediately after molting and peaked in newly emerged female adults. Among the examined tissues ovary had the highest transcript level, followed by fat body, midgut and integument, and legs. Three days after dsNlRan injection the NlRan mRNA abundance in the third-, fourth-, and fifth-instar nymphs was decreased by 94.3%, 98.4% and 97.0%, respectively. NlFTZ-F1 expression levels in treated third- and fourth-instar nymphs were reduced by 89.3% and 23.8%, respectively. In contrast, NlKr-h1 mRNA levels were up-regulated by 67.5 and 1.5 folds, respectively. NlRan knockdown significantly decreased the body weights, delayed development, and killed >85% of the nymphs at day seven. Two apparent phenotypic defects were observed: (1) Extended body form, and failed to molt; (2) The cuticle at the notum was split open but cannot completely shed off. The newly emerged female adults from dsNlRan injected fifth-instar nymphs showed lower levels of NlRan and vitellogenin, lower weight gain and honeydew excretion comparing with the blank control, and no offspring. Those results suggest that NlRan encodes a functional protein that was involved in development and reproduction. The study established proof of concept that NlRan could serve as a target for dsRNA-based pesticides for N. lugens control."

The patient-reported outcome version of the ""Echelle d'Humeur Dépressive"" (EHD-PRO) aims to differentiate between two dimensions of depressive mood in people living with MS (PwMS).First, to compare EHD-PRO assessment and its two dimensions, lack of emotional control and emotional blunting, between a large sample of healthy controls (HCs) and two samples of PwMS, relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS); and second, to analyse the relationships between EHD-PRO scores with neurological disability, cognitive function, fatigue and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL).Regardless of their phenotype, PwMS had significantly higher EHD-PRO scores than HCs. EHD-PRO scores did not differ between the two MS groups. EHD-PRO scores did not correlate with disability and fatigue scores, disease duration or cognitive z scores. In RRMS, the lack of emotional control was independently associated with a decrease in HR-QOL.The EHD-PRO is able to easily detect depressive mood and to differentiate between two clinical dimensions, emotional blunting and lack of emotional control. The scale is sensitive and seems robust to confounding factors. Lack of emotional control seems to contribute significantly to altered HR-QOL in RRMS."
https://openalex.org/W2135885950,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) is a major pathogen that causes avian colibacillosis and is associated with severe economic losses in the chicken-farming industry. Here, bacteriophage KBNP1315, infecting APEC strain KBP1315, was genomically and functionally characterized. The evolutionary relationships of KBNP1315 were analyzed at the genomic level using gene (protein)-sharing networks, the Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm, and comparative genomics. Our network analysis showed that KBNP1315 was connected to 30 members of the Autographivirinae subfamily, which comprises the SP6-, T7-, P60-, phiKMV-, GAP227- and KP34-related groups. Network decomposition suggested that KBNP1315 belongs to the SP6-like phages, but our comparison of putative encoded proteins revealed that key proteins of KBNP1315, including the tail spike protein and endolysin, had relative low levels of amino acid sequence similarity with other members of the SP6-like phages. Thus KBNP1315 may only be distantly related to the SP6-like phages, and (based on the difference in endolysin) its lysis mechanism may differ from theirs. To characterize the lytic functions of the holin and endolysin proteins from KBNP1315, we expressed these proteins individually or simultaneously in E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cell. Interestingly, the expressed endolysin was secreted into the periplasm and caused a high degree of host cell lysis that was dose-dependently delayed/blocked by NaN3-mediated inhibition of the SecA pathway. The expressed holin triggered only a moderate inhibition of cell growth, whereas coexpression of holin and endolysin enhanced the lytic effect of endolysin. Together, these results revealed that KBNP1315 appears to use a pin-holin/signal-arrest-release (SAR) endolysin pathway to trigger host cell lysis."
https://openalex.org/W2340869830,"This study aimed to investigate the needs of Australian food composition database user’s regarding database format and relate this to the format of databases available globally. Three semi structured synchronous online focus groups (M = 3, F = 11) and n = 6 female key informant interviews were recorded. Beliefs surrounding the use, training, understanding, benefits and limitations of food composition data and databases were explored. Verbatim transcriptions underwent preliminary coding followed by thematic analysis with NVivo qualitative analysis software to extract the final themes. Schematic analysis was applied to the final themes related to database format. Desktop analysis also examined the format of six key globally available databases. 24 dominant themes were established, of which five related to format; database use, food classification, framework, accessibility and availability, and data derivation. Desktop analysis revealed that food classification systems varied considerably between databases. Microsoft Excel was a common file format used in all databases, and available software varied between countries. User’s also recognised that food composition databases format should ideally be designed specifically for the intended use, have a user-friendly food classification system, incorporate accurate data with clear explanation of data derivation and feature user input. However, such databases are limited by data availability and resources. Further exploration of data sharing options should be considered. Furthermore, user’s understanding of food composition data and databases limitations is inherent to the correct application of non-specific databases. Therefore, further exploration of user FCDB training should also be considered."

However, the capacity of microcirculation would vary due to the gender differences. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique to monitor tissue oxygenation dynamics. In this study, the far-infrared (FIR) source was used for physiological intervention of microcirculation. The experimental results show that the nature difference of oxygenation status exists between male and female during FIR irradiation. Therefore, we suggest the NIRS-based assessment should be calibrated with the gender-related effect for clinical diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease."
https://openalex.org/W2246293952,"We previously characterized the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) as a regulator of adherens junction assembly and cell-to-cell adhesion in osteoblasts. This is a novel function since Rb is predominantly known as a cell cycle repressor. Herein, we characterized the molecular mechanisms by which Rb performs this function, hypothesizing that Rb controls the activity of known regulators of adherens junction assembly. We found that Rb represses the expression of the p21-activated protein kinase (Pak1), an effector of the small Rho GTPase Rac1. Rac1 is a well-known regulator of adherens junction assembly whose increased activity in cancer is linked to perturbations of intercellular adhesion. Using nuclear run-on and luciferase reporter transcription assays, we found that Pak1 repression by Rb is transcriptional, without affecting Pak1 mRNA and protein stability. Pak1 promoter bioinformatics showed multiple E2F1 binding sites within 155 base pairs of the transcriptional start site, and a Pak1-promoter region containing these E2F sites is susceptible to transcriptional inhibition by Rb. Chromatin immunoprecipitations showed that an Rb-E2F complex binds to the region of the Pak1 promoter containing the E2F1 binding sites, suggesting that Pak1 is an E2F target and that the repressive effect of Rb on Pak1 involves blocking the trans-activating capacity of E2F. A bioinformatics analysis showed elevated Pak1 expression in several solid tumors relative to adjacent normal tissue, with both Pak1 and E2F increased relative to normal tissue in breast cancer, supporting a cancer etiology for Pak1 up-regulation. Therefore, we propose that by repressing Pak1 expression, Rb prevents Rac1 hyperactivity usually associated with cancer and related to cytoskeletal derangements that disrupt cell adhesion, consequently enhancing cancer cell migratory capacity. This de-regulation of cell adhesion due to Rb loss could be part of the molecular events associated with cancer progression and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2171784587,"Single-molecule imaging of proteins in a 2D environment like membranes has been frequently used to extract diffusive properties of multiple fractions of receptors. In a 3D environment the apparent fractions however change with observation time due to the movements of molecules out of the depth-of-field of the microscope. Here we developed a mathematical framework that allowed us to correct for the change in fraction size due to the limited detection volume in 3D single-molecule imaging. We applied our findings on the mobility of activated glucocorticoid receptors in the cell nucleus, and found a freely diffusing fraction of 0.49±0.02. Our analysis further showed that interchange between this mobile fraction and an immobile fraction does not occur on time scales shorter than 150 ms."
https://openalex.org/W2341126577,"Acetylation of nucleosomal histones by diverse histone acetyltransferases (HAT) plays pivotal roles in many cellular events. Discoveries of novel HATs and HAT related factors have provided new insights to understand the roles and mechanisms of histone acetylation. In this study, we identified prominent Histone H3 acetylation activity in vitro and purified its activity, showing that it is composed of the MYST acetyltransferase Chameau and Enhancer of the Acetyltransferase Chameau (EAChm) family. EAChm is a negatively charged acidic protein retaining aspartate and glutamate. Furthermore, we identified that Chameau and EAChm stimulate transcription in vitro together with purified general transcription factors. In addition, RNA-seq analysis of Chameu KD and EAChm KD S2 cells suggest that Chameau and EAChm regulate transcription of common genes in vivo. Our results suggest that EAChm regulates gene transcription in Drosophila embryos by enhancing Acetyltransferase Chameau activity."
https://openalex.org/W2250233762,"Neolignans are secondary metabolites found in various groups of Angiosperms. They belong to a class of natural compounds with great diversity of chemical structures and pharmacological activities. These compounds are formed by linking two phenylpropanoid units. Several compounds that have ability to prevent genetic damage have been isolated from plants, and can be used to prevent or delay the development of tumor cells. Genetic toxicology evaluation is widely used in risk assessment of new drugs in preclinical screening tests. In this study, we evaluated the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of the neolignan analogue 2-(4-nitrophenoxy)-1-phenylethanone (4NF) and its protective effect against DNA damage using the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and the comet assay in mouse peripheral blood. Our results showed that this neolignan analogue had no genotoxic activity and was able to reduce induced damage both in mouse bone marrow and peripheral blood. Although the neolignan analogue 4NF was cytotoxic, it reduced cyclophosphamide-induced cytotoxicity. In conclusion, it showed no genotoxic action, but exhibited cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic activities."

Our general objective is to inquire what are the best procedures to communicate conceptual knowledge. We construct a simplified and controlled setup emulating important variables of pedagogy amenable to quantitative analysis. To this aim, we designed a game inspired in Chinese Whispers, to investigate which attributes of a description affect its capacity to faithfully convey an image. This is a two player game: an emitter and a receiver. The emitter was shown a simple geometric figure and was asked to describe it in words. He was informed that this description would be passed to the receiver who had to replicate the drawing from this description. We capitalized on vast data obtained from an android app to quantify the effect of different aspects of a description on communication precision. We show that descriptions more effectively communicate an image when they are coherent and when they are procedural. Instead, the creativity, the use of metaphors and the use of mathematical concepts do not affect its fidelity."
