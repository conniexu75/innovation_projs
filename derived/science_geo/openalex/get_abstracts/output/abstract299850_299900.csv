https://openalex.org/W2010375723,"Primary productivity of phytoplankton, measured as rate of carbon-14 uptake, was increased by adding iron and other nutrients to lake water, but was not increased by adding nutrients in the absence of iron. Concentrations of chelated iron ranging from 0.010 to 5.0 parts of iron per million increased primary productivity. Iron as a nutrient limiting primary productivity is related to the morphometry, physicochemical characteristics, and low productivity of the lake."

And if this idea is accepted, we are immediately drawn to the conclusion that this life is a very well-adapted and flourishing one-not the struggle for existence so often suggested in light of the obvious difficulties earthly organisms would have in living on Mars. The suggested criteria seem to eliminate all the known life forms, but of all these forms, a higher plant would require the least modification in order to meet the criteria. The basic shape of the leaf of a higher plant seems suited to conditions on Mars, but the lower gravity might well result in some interesting modifications in morphology. Some life forms on Mars might resemble our own higher plants, but we should be prepared to encounter some interesting surprises in biochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1988490273,"Hydrocalcite (CaCO3 ⋅ H2O) with exactly one molecule of hydrate water is the main component of carbonate scales deposited from cold water in contact with air. When the magnesium content of the water is high, the hydrocalcite occurs together with MgCO3 ⋅ 3H2O (nesquehonite). From the conditions under which hydrocalcite is transformed into calcite and aragonite, it appears that in some cases aragonite in nature may be formed by way of an intermediary of CaCO3 ⋅ H2O."
https://openalex.org/W2012335083,"Empirical plotting of four sets of equidistantly spaced shear stress trajectories, based on regularities in distribution of actual faults and ore veins in the continental area and on the landward prolongation of the big fracture zones of the northeastern Pacific, givesrise to a prospecting net for the western United States. Preferential accumulation of big ore deposits (including such deposits as Bingham and Tintic) along landward prolongation of the main fracture zones of northeastern Pacific, in the vicinity of intersections of four systems of trajectories, and along boundaries of crustal blocks suggests several possibilities for prospecting for unknown hydrothermal deposits in the Cordilleran part of the United States."

https://openalex.org/W1975879382,The radiocarbon activity found in tree rings from southern Argentina shows secular fluctuations which are synchronous with and of the same amplitude as those known for the Northern Hemisphere. Comparable measurements indicate that the activity in Patagonian trees is about five per mil lower than in European trees.

https://openalex.org/W2087954508,"The Hopewell and Flemington faults in New Jersey are inferred to extend 10 to 15 miles or more farther north than their previously mapped northward limits. The Hopewell fault, previously known to show dip-slip displacement of 10,000 feet or more, is inferred to include as well a right-lateral strike-slip component of 12 miles on the basis of apparent displacement along its northern extension of the crestal traces of two partial anticlines which are held to be displaced segments of the same transverse structure, here called the Somerville anticline. An unknown amount of strike-slip displacement may have occurred also on the Flemington fault, if the apparent offset of the Ramapo fault at the northwestern border of the Triassic outcrop belt is explained as the result of displacement of a formerly continuous northeast-trending, southeast-dipping fault by a north-trending vertical extension of the Flemington fault."
https://openalex.org/W2155419161,It is hypothesized that the probability of detecting a signal in a vigilance task depends upon its temporal location with respect to the preceding series of signals. Probability of detection should be at a maximum when the signal occurs after a temporal interval which is equivalent to the mean of the intervals between the preceding signals detected. The experimental results support this hypothesis.

https://openalex.org/W2017076945,"Some terrestrial particulate silicate rocks with complex particle shapes have internal friction angles over 45 degrees and cohesion of about 0.1 newton per square centimeter at bulk densities of 0.6 to 0.8 gram per cubic centimeter. Mechanical and other properties of the lunar surface layer, observed with spacecraft, may be consistent with a low bulk density and complex reentrant shapes for the fine particles."

https://openalex.org/W4249290565,"On Decemrber 30, 1947 the AAAS Council passed a resolution instructing the President of the Association to appoint a Special Committee on Civil Liberties for Scientists. Maurice B. Visscher was named chairman, and with Philip Bard, Robert E. Cushman, Richard L. MVeier, and James R. Ncwmen as members, and Walter Gellhorn as consultant, the Committee completed its investigations and submitted a 77-page report of findings and recommendations in December 1948. The full text was referred to the Council, which voted by an overwhelming majority to publicize the findings, and it is planned ultimately to make the complete report available at cost to those who want access to it. Announcement will be made in Science when Maurice B. Visscher and E. C. Stakman have concluded editorial revisions and the report is ready for distribution. Meanwhile, by vote of the Executive Committee at its meeting July 7, the conclusions and recommendations are published herewith."
