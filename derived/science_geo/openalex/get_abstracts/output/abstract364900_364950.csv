https://openalex.org/W2007505836,"The intracellular storage and utilization of lipids are critical to maintain cellular energy homeostasis. During nutrient deprivation, cellular lipids stored as triglycerides in lipid droplets are hydrolysed into fatty acids for energy. A second cellular response to starvation is the induction of autophagy, which delivers intracellular proteins and organelles sequestered in double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) to lysosomes for degradation and use as an energy source. Lipolysis and autophagy share similarities in regulation and function but are not known to be interrelated. Here we show a previously unknown function for autophagy in regulating intracellular lipid stores (macrolipophagy). Lipid droplets and autophagic components associated during nutrient deprivation, and inhibition of autophagy in cultured hepatocytes and mouse liver increased triglyceride storage in lipid droplets. This study identifies a critical function for autophagy in lipid metabolism that could have important implications for human diseases with lipid over-accumulation such as those that comprise the metabolic syndrome. Lipid droplets are cytoplasmic organelles that store lipids such as triglycerides and cholesterol. Under conditions of nutrient deprivation, droplet triglycerides are hydrolysed to generate free fatty acids that are oxidized to provide energy. A second cellular response to starvation is autophagy, in which the cell digests its own components to provide nutrients. Singh et al. describe a novel function for autophagy in regulating lipid metabolism, which they term 'macrolipophagy'. In this process, lipid droplets and autophagic components associate during starvation and inhibition of autophagy increases lipid storage in lipid droplets. Autophagy promotes lipid hydrolysis and generation of free fatty acids by releasing the content of lipid droplets to lysosomes for degradation. This work identifies a critical role of autophagy in regulating lipid metabolism and may provide a new approach to the prevention of lipid accumulation in disease.

As well as originating from this 'secondary source', positrons might also be generated in primary sources such as pulsars and microquasars — or by dark matter annihilation. A new measurement of the positron fraction in the cosmic radiation for the energy range 1.5–100 GeV has been made using data from the PAMELA satellite experiment. Previous measurements, made predominantly by balloon-borne instruments, yield a positron fraction compatible with 'secondary source' production from interactions between cosmic ray nuclei and interstellar matter. Above 10 GeV the new measurements deviate significantly from this expectation, pointing to the presence of a primary source, either a nearby astrophysical object or dark matter particle annihilations. Cosmic ray positrons are known to be produced by interactions in the interstellar medium, but they might also originate in primary sources, such as pulsars, micro-quasars or through dark matter annihilation. Adriani et al. report that the positron fraction increases sharply over much of the energy range 1.5–100 GeV, which appears to be completely inconsistent with secondary sources—they therefore conclude that a primary source is necessary. Antiparticles account for a small fraction of cosmic rays and are known to be produced in interactions between cosmic-ray nuclei and atoms in the interstellar medium1, which is referred to as a ‘secondary source’. Positrons might also originate in objects such as pulsars2 and microquasars3 or through dark matter annihilation4, which would be ‘primary sources’. Previous statistically limited measurements5,6,7 of the ratio of positron and electron fluxes have been interpreted as evidence for a primary source for the positrons, as has an increase in the total electron+positron flux at energies between 300 and 600 GeV (ref. 8). Here we report a measurement of the positron fraction in the energy range 1.5–100 GeV. We find that the positron fraction increases sharply over much of that range, in a way that appears to be completely inconsistent with secondary sources. We therefore conclude that a primary source, be it an astrophysical object or dark matter annihilation, is necessary."

https://openalex.org/W2172104963,"Just as a body moving in a vacuum tends to stay in motion, the axis of a spinning electron tends to remain fixed in direction. Both phenomena are conservation laws that ultimately derive from the uniformity of empty space. By contrast, an electron moving in a semiconductor sees a lattice of charged atoms flying past at nearly 1% of light speed, causing its spin direction to fluctuate wildly. Now Koralek et al. demonstrate that the application of an external electric field to a semiconductor can precisely balance the spin-destabilizing effect of the charged lattice. The collective spin of the entire gas of electrons, rather than that of each individual particle, then emerges as a new conserved quantity — a property well suited for 'spintronics' applications. The axis of a spinning electron tends to remain fixed in direction: in contrast, an electron moving in a semiconductor sees a lattice of charged atoms flying past, causing its spin direction to fluctuate. Koralek and colleagues demonstrate that an electric field applied to the semiconductor can balance this spin-destabilizing effect; the collective spin of the entire gas of electrons is conserved, a property well-suited for 'spintronics' applications. According to Noether’s theorem1, for every symmetry in nature there is a corresponding conservation law. For example, invariance with respect to spatial translation corresponds to conservation of momentum. In another well-known example, invariance with respect to rotation of the electron’s spin, or SU(2) symmetry, leads to conservation of spin polarization. For electrons in a solid, this symmetry is ordinarily broken by spin–orbit coupling, allowing spin angular momentum to flow to orbital angular momentum. However, it has recently been predicted that SU(2) can be achieved in a two-dimensional electron gas, despite the presence of spin–orbit coupling2. The corresponding conserved quantities include the amplitude and phase of a helical spin density wave termed the ‘persistent spin helix’2. SU(2) is realized, in principle, when the strengths of two dominant spin–orbit interactions, the Rashba3 (strength parameterized by α) and linear Dresselhaus4 (β1) interactions, are equal. This symmetry is predicted to be robust against all forms of spin-independent scattering, including electron–electron interactions, but is broken by the cubic Dresselhaus term (β3) and spin-dependent scattering. When these terms are negligible, the distance over which spin information can propagate is predicted to diverge as α approaches β1. Here we report experimental observation of the emergence of the persistent spin helix in GaAs quantum wells by independently tuning α and β1. Using transient spin-grating spectroscopy5, we find a spin-lifetime enhancement of two orders of magnitude near the symmetry point. Excellent quantitative agreement with theory across a wide range of sample parameters allows us to obtain an absolute measure of all relevant spin–orbit terms, identifying β3 as the main SU(2)-violating term in our samples. The tunable suppression of spin relaxation demonstrated in this work is well suited for application to spintronics6,7."

https://openalex.org/W1971961101,"CRM1 (also known as XPO1 and exportin 1) mediates nuclear export of hundreds of proteins through the recognition of the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (LR-NES). Here we present the 2.9 Å structure of CRM1 bound to snurportin 1 (SNUPN). Snurportin 1 binds CRM1 in a bipartite manner by means of an amino-terminal LR-NES and its nucleotide-binding domain. The LR-NES is a combined α-helical-extended structure that occupies a hydrophobic groove between two CRM1 outer helices. The LR-NES interface explains the consensus hydrophobic pattern, preference for intervening electronegative residues and inhibition by leptomycin B. The second nuclear export signal epitope is a basic surface on the snurportin 1 nucleotide-binding domain, which binds an acidic patch on CRM1 adjacent to the LR-NES site. Multipartite recognition of individually weak nuclear export signal epitopes may be common to CRM1 substrates, enhancing CRM1 binding beyond the generally low affinity LR-NES. Similar energetic construction is also used in multipartite nuclear localization signals to provide broad substrate specificity and rapid evolution in nuclear transport. CRM1 is a nuclear transport receptor that mediates export of a large number of proteins out of the nucleus through recognition of leucine-rich nuclear export signals (LR-NES). In this study, Chook and colleagues present the crystal structure of CRM1 in complex with a substrate called snurportin1. Snurportin1 binds CRM1 in a bipartite manner through an N-terminal LR-NES and its nucleotide-binding domain. Further analysis reveals a second NES epitope in the nucleotide-binding domain of snurportin1. The authors propose that multipartite recognition of individually weak NES epitopes may be a common feature of CRM1 binding.

https://openalex.org/W2003744323,"Acetylcholine receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that mediate rapid synaptic transmission. Each receptor possesses two agonist-binding sites, whose occupation leads to channel opening, but the precise molecular events that follow agonist binding are unclear. Here, Mukhtasimova et al. covalently lock receptors in conformations equivalent to agonist-bound states, and observe that each binding site initiates the formation of one of two 'primed' states, from which the channels are able to open and close. The acetylcholine receptor, which mediates rapid synaptic transmission, possesses two agonist binding sites, the occupation of which leads to channel opening; however, the precise molecular events that follow agonist binding are unclear. Here, the receptors are locked in conformations equivalent to agonist-bound states, and it is observed that each binding site initiates the formation of one of two 'primed' states from which the channels are able to open and close. In the course of synaptic transmission in the brain and periphery, acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) rapidly transduce a chemical signal into an electrical impulse. The speed of transduction is facilitated by rapid ACh association and dissociation, suggesting a binding site relatively non-selective for small cations. Selective transduction has been thought to originate from the ability of ACh, over that of other organic cations, to trigger the subsequent channel-opening step. However, transitions to and from the open state were shown to be similar for agonists with widely different efficacies1,2,3. By studying mutant AChRs, we show here that the ultimate closed-to-open transition is agonist-independent and preceded by two primed closed states; the first primed state elicits brief openings, whereas the second elicits long-lived openings. Long-lived openings and the associated primed state are detected in the absence and presence of an agonist, and exhibit the same kinetic signatures under both conditions. By covalently locking the agonist-binding sites in the bound conformation, we find that each site initiates a priming step. Thus, a change in binding-site conformation primes the AChR for channel opening in a process that enables selective activation by ACh while maximizing the speed and efficiency of the biological response."

We allowed participants to manipulate colour calibrated facial photographs along empirically-measured oxygenated and deoxygenated blood colour axes both separately and simultaneously, to optimise healthy appearance. Participants increased skin blood colour, particularly oxygenated, above basal levels to optimise healthy appearance. We show, therefore, that skin blood perfusion and oxygenation influence perceived health in a way that may be important to mate choice."
https://openalex.org/W1989555063,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a serious mosquito-borne pathogen causing significant global disease burden, either as classic dengue fever (DF) or in its most severe manifestation dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Nearly half of the world's population is at risk of dengue disease and there are estimated to be millions of infections annually; a situation which will continue to worsen with increasing expansion of the mosquito vectors and epidemic DF/DHF. Currently there are no available licensed vaccines or antivirals for dengue, although significant effort has been directed toward the development of safe and efficacious dengue vaccines for over 30 years. Promising vaccine candidates are in development and testing phases, but a better understanding of immune responses to DENV infection and vaccination is needed. Humoral immune responses to DENV infection are complex and may exacerbate pathogenicity, yet are essential for immune protection. In this report, we develop DENV-2 envelope (E) protein epitope-specific antigens and measure immunoglobulin responses to three distinct epitopes in DENV-2 infected human serum samples. Immunoglobulin responses to DENV-2 infection exhibited significant levels of individual variation. Antibody populations targeting broadly cross-reactive epitopes centered on the fusion peptide in structural domain II were large, highly variable, and greater in primary than in secondary DENV-2 infected sera. E protein domain III cross-reactive immunoglobulin populations were similarly variable and much larger in IgM than in IgG. DENV-2 specific domain III IgG formed a very small proportion of the antibody response yet was significantly correlated with DENV-2 neutralization, suggesting that the highly protective IgG recognizing this epitope in murine studies plays a role in humans as well. This report begins to tease apart complex humoral immune responses to DENV infection and is thus important for improving our understanding of dengue disease and immunological correlates of protection, relevant to DENV vaccine development and testing."
https://openalex.org/W2046839445,"The current consensus is that galaxies begin as small density fluctuations in the early Universe and grow by in situ star formation and hierarchical merging. Stars begin to form relatively quickly in sub-galactic-sized building blocks called haloes which are subsequently assembled into galaxies. However, exactly when this assembly takes place is a matter of some debate. Here we report that the stellar masses of brightest cluster galaxies, which are the most luminous objects emitting stellar light, some 9 billion years ago are not significantly different from their stellar masses today. Brightest cluster galaxies are almost fully assembled 4-5 billion years after the Big Bang, having grown to more than 90 per cent of their final stellar mass by this time. Our data conflict with the most recent galaxy formation models based on the largest simulations of dark-matter halo development. These models predict protracted formation of brightest cluster galaxies over a Hubble time, with only 22 per cent of the stellar mass assembled at the epoch probed by our sample. Our findings suggest a new picture in which brightest cluster galaxies experience an early period of rapid growth rather than prolonged hierarchical assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2080806128,"Missense mutations in park2, encoding the parkin protein, account for ∼50% of autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson disease (ARJP) cases. Parkin belongs to the family of RBR (RING-between-RING) E3 ligases involved in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation and trafficking of proteins such as Pael-R and synphillin-1. The proposed architecture of parkin, based largely on sequence similarity studies, consists of N-terminal ubiquitin-like and C-terminal RBR domains. These domains are separated by a ∼160-residue unique parkin sequence having no recognizable domain structure. We used limited proteolysis experiments on bacterially expressed and purified parkin to identify a new domain (RING0) within the unique parkin domain sequence. RING0 comprises two distinct, conserved cysteine-rich clusters between Cys150–Cys169 and Cys196–His215 consisting of CX2-3CX11CX2C and CX4–6CX10–16-CX2(H/C) motifs. The positions of the cysteine/histidine residues in this region bear similarity to parkin RING1 and RING2 domains, as well as other E3 ligase RING domains. However, in parkin a 26-residue linker region separates the motifs, which is not typical of other RING domain structures. Further, the RING0 domain includes all but one of the known ARJP mutation sites between the ubiquitin-like and RBR regions of parkin. Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry analysis, we determined that the RING0, RING1, IBR, and RING2 domains each bind two Zn2+ ions, the first observation of an E3 ligase with the ability to bind eight metal ions. Removal of the zinc from parkin causes near complete unfolding of the protein, an observation that rationalizes cysteine-based ARJP mutations found throughout parkin, including RING0 (C212Y) that form cellular inclusions and/or are defective for ubiquitination likely because of poor zinc binding and misfolding. The identification of the RING0 domain in parkin provides a new overall domain structure for the protein that will be important in assessing the roles of ARJP mutations and designing experiments aimed at understanding the disease.

ARJP is characterized by the onset of Parkinsonian symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. It is distinguished from the idiopathic form of Parkinson disease by the onset of symptoms, prior to the age of forty.

However, the RING2 domain of HHARI binds a single Zn2+ (36Capili A.D. Edghill E.L. Wu K. Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1117-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and because this is the only RING2 structure available for an RBR protein, it suggests that there may be variability in the number of Zn2+ ions coordinated by different RING domains. The recent three-dimensional structure of the parkin IBR domain (23Beasley S.A. Hristova V.A. Shaw G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3095-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) revealed a two-site zinc-binding motif with a novel fold compared with other zinc-binding motifs (37Matthews J.M. Sunde M. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, despite the potential importance of zinc binding to the RING domains (or other portions) of parkin, the ability and capacity for zinc coordination or its impact on structure has not been identified for parkin. The N terminus of parkin comprises a ubiquitin-like domain (UblD) proposed to facilitate the delivery and degradation of ubiquitinated substrates by the 26 S proteosome via interactions with the S5a subunit (38Sakata E. Yamaguchi Y. Kurimoto E. Kikuchi J. Yokoyama S. Yamada S. Kawahara H. Yokosawa H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Tanaka K. Kato K.

NMR. 2003; 25: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The central ∼150 residues of parkin separating the UblD from the RBR region are referred to as the unique parkin domain (UPD). This segment of parkin is essential for function, and ARJP associated mutations within this region have been shown to lead to dysfunction of parkin E3 ligase activity (40Sato S. Chiba T. Sakata E. Kato K. Mizuno Y. Hattori N. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 41Ren Y. Zhao J. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the absence of any sequence similarity to other proteins or the identification of a distinct domain within the UPD has made these experiments difficult to interpret. Other than the isolated UblD and IBR domains of parkin, there has been limited success with the purification and characterization of parkin, especially when lacking affinity tags in the final purified form. Bacterially expressed parkin typically shows a heterogeneous mixture of full-length and degraded protein species, making characterization of the protein difficult (42Rankin C.A. Joazeiro C.A. Floor E. Hunter T. J. Biomed. Sci. 2001; 8: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this work we have used purified parkin to identify a novel zinc-binding C4C3(C/H) domain upstream of the RBR region and within the UPD. We have used limited proteolysis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to show that this domain coordinates two Zn2+ ions in addition to six other Zn2+ ions in the RBR C terminus. The presence of a new parkin-specific zinc-binding domain provides insight into the structure of parkin and opens the door to establish the importance of this domain in ARJP for this new subclass of RBR E3 ligases. Recombinant Parkin—Human parkin was cloned from the Human Fetal Brain Marathon-Ready cDNA library (Clontech) and ligated into the PCR Blunt-TOPO vector using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR kit from Invitrogen. The human parkin sequence was then transferred to the pGEX-4T3 bacterial expression vector. Rat parkin cloned into a pGEX-4T1 vector was received from Dr. Ted Fon (McGill University). Protein Expression and Purification—The pGEX-4T1 and pGEX-4T3 parkin constructs were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Codon Plus competent cells and grown at 37 °C in LB containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin until an A600 of 0.6 was recorded. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 50 μm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, supplemented by 500 μm ZnCl2. Following induction, the temperature was reduced to 16 °C, and the cells were grown overnight. The E. coli cells were harvested and lysed by sonication on ice in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol buffer supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Triton X-100 was added to the cell lysate to a final concentration of 1%, and the sample was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with rotation. Centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 30 min was performed prior to collecting the supernatant. The remainder of the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C, unless indicated otherwise. GST-parkin was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on a 20-ml GST Prep FF 16/10 affinity chromatography column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm glutathione. Purified parkin was dialyzed 300-fold against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The parkin sample was concentrated to a 5-ml volume using Amicon Ultra concentrators with a mass cut-off of 10 kDa (Millipore). The GST tag was cleaved from the construct with 1.5 μg of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences), with rotation at room temperature for 30 min. Thrombin was removed from the sample with p-aminobenzamidine-agarose beads (Sigma) by incubation with rotation at room temperature for 30 min. Removal of the GST tag from human and rat parkin cloned into the pGEX-4T3 and pGEX-4T1 vectors, respectively, resulted in short residual sequences preceding the N-terminal sequence of parkin. Human parkin is preceded by a GSPNS amino acid sequence, and a GSPGIPARPAATTLPVT sequence is found N-terminal to methionine at position one of rat parkin. Parkin was separated from the GST tag on the 20-ml GST Prep FF 16/10 affinity column, using a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The flow through was concentrated to 500 μl using Amicon Ultra concentrators with a 10-kDa cut-off (Millipore) and separated on a 120-ml Superdex HiLoad 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Auto-ubiquitination assays of GST-parkin and parkin were carried out in a 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP buffer using standard ubiquitin conjugation reagents and enzymes (Boston Biochem) unless indicated otherwise. Bacterially expressed GST-parkin and parkin at concentrations of 25 μm each were incubated with 90 nm of E1 enzyme, 0.2 mm ubiquitin, 2.5 μm of Ubc7 (expressed and purified as a His6-Ubc7 protein from a pET28a construct), 4 mm MgATP, and 1× reaction buffer. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h, inhibited with E1 inhibition buffer, and then heated to 100 °C with Laemmli sample buffer prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Ubiquitination was identified by Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibody, used according to the manufacturers protocol. Limited Proteolysis—Parkin was subjected to limited proteolysis with both trypsin and V8 proteases. Six 140-μl samples of 50 μm parkin were incubated at 4 °C with 0.4 μg of trypsin or V8 each for 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 min. Upon completion 20 μl from each sample were heated to 100 °C with Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. Protease activity in the remainder of each reaction was inhibited with 5% formic acid; the sample was then desalted by centrifugation with protein desalting spin columns (Pierce). These samples were analyzed by ESI-MS (University of Western Ontario Biological Mass Spectrometry Laboratory). Mass fragments detected by ESI-MS were assigned to parkin sequences using the ProteinInfo amino acid sequence analysis tool PROWL. Bioinformatics—A comprehensive list of parkin orthologs was compiled from a search of the RefSeq nonredundant protein data base (Release 29) and the Uniprot databases, resulting in a list of proteins from 28 separate species based on human isoform 1. The multiple sequence alignment was originally created using ClustalW and manually edited using Jalview. The list was parsed based the exclusion of alternate isoforms, as well as sequences containing probable errors such as the Bos taurus parkin that possesses an extended C terminus. The full-length sequences for parkin from human, mouse, rat, fly, worm, and HOIL-1 were submitted for PONDR VSL1 analysis. Circular Dichroism Spectropolarimetry—Parkin samples in the range of 3–5 μm were analyzed using a Jasco J-810 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter. A 0.1-mm cell was used to measure protein absorbance in the UV range between 240 and 190 nm, keeping high tension voltage below 600 V. Fifty scans were collected per sample at 4 °C. EDTA was titrated into each parkin sample and equilibrated for 15 min after each addition prior to data collection. A CD spectrum of the buffer in the presence and absence of EDTA was collected at the beginning of each experiment and used for base-line correction. Zinc Analysis by ICP-AES and Quadropole Time-of-flight ESI-MS—Parkin, eluted from the Superdex HiLoad 16/10 gel filtration column, was submitted for ICP-AES Zn2+ analysis to determine the concentration of Zn2+ in the sample (Laboratory for Geochemical Analysis, University of Western Ontario). The concentration of parkin in the sample was identified by the guanidine hydrochloride denaturation method and amino acid analysis done at the Amino Acid Analysis Facility at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. The total number of Zn2+ ions bound to parkin was determined by quadropole time-of-flight ESI-MS (University of Western Ontario Biological Mass Spectrometry Laboratory) done on full-length parkin eluted from the Superdex HiLoad 16/10 column and dialyzed 1000-fold against 120 mm ammonium acetate at a pH of 7.4. Differential Stability of Rat and Human Parkin—Stability has proven to be the major limitation in the large scale purification of bacterially expressed parkin (42Rankin C.A. Joazeiro C.A. Floor E. Hunter T. J. Biomed. Sci. 2001; 8: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To identify the source of instability in the parkin protein, the human and rat forms of the protein were expressed as GST fusion proteins (pGEX-4T3 and pGEX-4T1) in E. coli BL21 Codon Plus cells. Following GST-glutathione affinity chromatography, thrombin cleavage, and a second GST-glutathione affinity step, the protein was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis of the elution profile showed the presence of bands near 52 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1) that were confirmed by ESI-MS as the rat protein (observed molecular mass, 53165.1 ± 2.8 Da; calculated molecular mass, 53167.6 Da) and human protein (observed molecular mass, 52063.6 ± 2.5 Da; calculated molecular mass, 52063.0). Although the rat form of parkin reproducibly eluted as a single purified form, the human protein consistently showed the presence of other bands, notably a band near 12 kDa. ESI-MS analysis showed this band had a mass of 11980.1 ± 0.2 Da, very close to that calculated for a C-terminal cleavage at residue Thr103 within the UPD of human parkin by an unspecified source. The presence of this cleavage product is very similar to that previously observed by Rankin and co-workers (42Rankin C.A. Joazeiro C.A. Floor E. Hunter T. J. Biomed. Sci. 2001; 8: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This fragment incorporated the entire UblD (residues 1–75) and the first 28 residues from the UPD. This region is the most divergent between the rat and human orthologs possessing only 38/53 (71%) similarity between residues Asp87 and Arg140. Further, sequence analysis of parkin using the program PONDR predicted a disordered state for residues 75–141 of the UPD where cleavage was noted. Based on our results, the sequence difference in rat parkin within this region prevents its cleavage and allows for the purification of milligram levels of full-length parkin lacking fusion protein tags. Ubiquitin Ligase Activity of in Vitro Purified Parkin—Parkin is a ubiquitin ligase capable of auto-ubiquitination, as well as ubiquitination of other substrate proteins including PAEL-R, synphilin, and Sept5 (26Zhang Y.

The availability of full-length parkin lacking a fusion tag enabled us to compare in vitro auto-ubiquitination of GST-parkin and parkin to determine whether the bacterially purified protein was properly folded in the absence of an N-terminal carrier protein. Auto-ubiquitination reactions using GST-parkin and parkin were assessed using different combinations of ubiquitin, E1 enzyme, and the E2 ubiquitin conjugation enzyme Ubc7. For both GST-parkin and parkin a broad high molecular mass ladder was observed above the parent protein as monitored by either SDS-PAGE or Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). This ladder is characteristic of covalent modification by ubiquitin resulting in a distribution of multiple ubiquitinated forms of either GST-parkin or parkin proteins. In the absence of E1, ubiquitin, or parkin, the higher molecular mass species corresponding to a ubiquitinated parkin protein was not observed. These results indicate that both the bacterially expressed GST-parkin and parkin generated in this study are functional and capable of carrying out auto-ubiquitination in vitro. Although several studies have shown that bacterially expressed parkin carrying an N-terminal tag is functional in auto-ubiquitination assays, this work is the first to show that the untagged protein also participates in this function. This observation demonstrates that full-length parkin lacking an N-terminal tag adopts a correctly folded structure that can be used for further characterization of this E3 ligase protein. A New Domain in Parkin Identified by V8 and Trypsin Limited Proteolysis—Sequence similarity and alignment methods have identified the N-terminal UblD (1–75) and C-terminal RBR domains (238–465) in parkin, whereas the central UPD (76–238) conforms to no known domain sequence or structural motif (22Morett E.

https://openalex.org/W1968298245,"Human noroviruses are the major viral pathogens of epidemic acute gastroenteritis. These genetically diverse viruses comprise two major genogroups (GI and GII) and approximately 30 genotypes. Noroviruses recognize human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) in a diverse, strain-specific manner. Recently the crystal structures of the HBGA-binding interfaces of the GI Norwalk virus and the GII VA387 have been determined, which allows us to examine the genetic and structural relationships of the HBGA-binding interfaces of noroviruses with variable HBGA-binding patterns. Our hypothesis is that, if HBGAs are the viral receptors necessary for norovirus infection and spread, their binding interfaces should be under a selection pressure in the evolution of noroviruses.Structural comparison of the HBGA-binding interfaces of the two noroviruses has revealed shared features but significant differences in the location, sequence composition, and HBGA-binding modes. On the other hand, the primary sequences of the HBGA-binding interfaces are highly conserved among strains within each genogroup. The roles of critical residues within the binding sites have been verified by site-directed mutagenesis followed by functional analysis of strains with variable HBGA-binding patterns.Our data indicate that the human HBGAs are an important factor in norovirus evolution. Each of the two major genogroups represents an evolutionary lineage characterized by distinct genetic traits. Functional convergence of strains with the same HBGA targets subsequently resulted in acquisition of analogous HBGA binding interfaces in the two genogroups that share an overall structural similarity, despite their distinct locations and amino acid compositions. On the other hand, divergent evolution may have contributed to the observed overall differences between and within the two lineages. Thus, both divergent and convergent evolution, as well as the polymorphic human HBGAs, likely contribute to the diversity of noroviruses. The finding of genogroup-specific conservation of HBGA binding interfaces will facilitate the development of rational strategies to control and prevent norovirus-associated gastroenteritis."
https://openalex.org/W1969281636,"Lung adenocarcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women in the world. Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, the mortality rates with an overall 5-year survival of only 15%. This high mortality is probably attributable to early metastasis. Although several well-known markers correlated with poor/metastasis prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients by immunohistochemistry was reported, the molecular mechanisms of lung adenocarcinoma development are still not clear. To explore novel molecular markers and their signaling pathways will be crucial for aiding in treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients.To identify novel lung adenocarcinoma-associated /metastasis genes and to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of these targets in lung cancer progression, we created a bioinformatics scheme consisting of integrating three gene expression profile datasets, including pairwise lung adenocarcinoma, secondary metastatic tumors vs. benign tumors, and a series of invasive cell lines. Among the novel targets identified, FLJ10540 was overexpressed in lung cancer tissues and is associated with cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we employed two co-expression strategies to identify in which pathway FLJ10540 was involved. Lung adenocarcinoma array profiles and tissue microarray IHC staining data showed that FLJ10540 and VEGF-A, as well as FLJ10540 and phospho-AKT exhibit positive correlations, respectively. Stimulation of lung cancer cells with VEGF-A results in an increase in FLJ10540 protein expression and enhances complex formation with PI3K. Treatment with VEGFR2 and PI3K inhibitors affects cell migration and invasion by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, knockdown of FLJ10540 destabilizes formation of the P110-alpha/P85-alpha-(PI3K) complex, further supporting the participation of FLJ10540 in the VEGF-A/PI3K/AKT pathway.This finding set the stage for further testing of FLJ10540 as a new therapeutic target for treating lung cancer and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies that are able to block the PI3K/AKT pathway in lung cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2044085158,"Although it is conceivable that cancer preventive isothiocyanates (ITCs), a family of compounds in cruciferous vegetables, induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through a mechanism involving oxidative stress, our study shows that binding to cellular proteins correlates with their potencies of apoptosis induction. More recently, we showed that ITCs bind selectively to tubulins. The differential binding affinities toward tubulin among benzyl isothiocyanate, phenethyl isothiocyanate, and sulforaphane correlate well with their potencies of inducing tubulin conformation changes, microtubule depolymerization, and eventual cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human lung cancer A549 cells. These results support that tubulin binding by ITCs is an early event for cell growth inhibition. Here we demonstrate that ITCs can selectively induce degradation of both alpha- and beta-tubulins in a variety of human cancer cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The onset of degradation, a rapid and irreversible process, is initiated by tubulin aggregation, and the degradation is proteasome-dependent. Results indicate that the degradation is triggered by ITC binding to tubulin and is irrelevant to oxidative stress. This is the first report that tubulin, a stable and abundant cytoskeleton protein required for cell cycle progression, can be selectively degraded by a small molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2075040375,"A major challenge for ancient DNA (aDNA) studies on insect remains is that sampling procedures involve at least partial destruction of the specimens. A recent extraction protocol reveals the possibility of obtaining DNA from past insect remains without causing visual morphological damage. We test the applicability of this protocol on historic museum beetle specimens dating back to AD 1820 and on ancient beetle chitin remains from permafrost (permanently frozen soil) dating back more than 47,000 years. Finally, we test the possibility of obtaining ancient insect DNA directly from non-frozen sediments deposited 3280-1800 years ago -- an alternative approach that also does not involve destruction of valuable material.The success of the methodological approaches are tested by PCR and sequencing of COI and 16S mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments of 77-204 base pairs (-bp) in size using species-specific and general insect primers.The applied non-destructive DNA extraction method shows promising potential on insect museum specimens of historical age as far back as AD 1820, but less so on the ancient permafrost-preserved insect fossil remains tested, where DNA was obtained from samples up to ca. 26,000 years old. The non-frozen sediment DNA approach appears to have great potential for recording the former presence of insect taxa not normally preserved as macrofossils and opens new frontiers in research on ancient biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2070582388,"WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein-1 (WISP1), a member of the CYR61/CTGF/Nov family of growth factors, can mediate cell growth, transformation, and survival. Previously we demonstrated that WISP1 is up-regulated in post-infarct heart, stimulates cardiac fibroblast proliferation, and is induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Here we investigated (i) the localization of TNF-alpha and WISP1 in post-infarct heart, (ii) the mechanism of TNF-alpha-mediated WISP1 induction in primary human cardiac fibroblasts (CF), (iii) the role of WISP1 in TNF-alpha-mediated CF proliferation and collagen production, and (iv) the effects of WISP1 on TNF-alpha-mediated cardiomyocyte death. TNF-alpha and WISP1 expressions were increased in the border zones and non-ischemic remote regions of the post-ischemic heart. In CF, TNF-alpha potently induced WISP1 expression in cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent manner. TNF-alpha induced CREB phosphorylation in vitro and DNA binding and reporter gene activities in vivo. TNF-alpha induced CREB activation via ERK1/2, and inhibition of ERK1/2 and CREB blunted TNF-alpha-mediated WISP1 induction. Most importantly, WISP1 knockdown attenuated TNF-alpha stimulated collagen production and CF proliferation. Furthermore, WISP1 attenuated TNF-alpha-mediated cardiomyocyte death, thus demonstrating pro-mitogenic and pro-survival effects for WISP1 in myocardial constituent cells. Our results suggest that a TNF-alpha/WISP1 signaling pathway may contribute to post-infarct cardiac remodeling, a condition characterized by fibrosis and progressive cardiomyocyte loss."
https://openalex.org/W2118056386,"Glycogen synthase (GS) is considered the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogenesis but still today there is a lack of understanding on its regulation. We have previously shown phosphorylation-dependent GS intracellular redistribution at the start of glycogen re-synthesis in rabbit skeletal muscle (Prats, C., Cadefau, J.

In the present study we investigate the regulation of human muscle GS activity by glycogen, exercise, and insulin. Using immunocytochemistry we investigate the existence and relevance of GS intracellular compartmentalization during exercise and during glycogen re-synthesis. The results show that GS intrinsic activity is strongly dependent on glycogen levels and that such regulation involves associated dephosphorylation at sites 2+2a, 3a, and 3a + 3b. Furthermore, we report the existence of several glycogen metabolism regulatory mechanisms based on GS intracellular compartmentalization. After exhausting exercise, epinephrine-induced protein kinase A activation leads to GS site 1b phosphorylation targeting the enzyme to intramyofibrillar glycogen particles, which are preferentially used during muscle contraction. On the other hand, when phosphorylated at sites 2+2a, GS is preferentially associated with subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar glycogen particles. Finally, we verify the existence in human vastus lateralis muscle of the previously reported mechanism of glycogen metabolism regulation in rabbit tibialis anterior muscle.

The first scientific studies on GS date from the 1960s, but still today there is a lack of understanding on its regulation. GS is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogenesis and is classically used as an example of an allosterically and covalently regulated enzyme. It is well accepted that GS is complexly regulated by sequences of hierarchal phosphorylations (10.Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in at least nine sites and by its allosteric activator, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) (11.Rothman-Denes L.B. Cabib E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12.Villar-Palasi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the exact effects of GS phosphorylation at different sites on its regulation are still not clear. GS phosphorylation sites are distributed between the NH2- and the COOH-terminal domains. The NH2 terminus domain contains two sites, 2 (Ser7) and 2a (Ser10), that are phosphorylated in a hierarchal mode. Phosphorylation of site 2 is needed as a recognition motif for casein kinase 1 to phosphorylate site 2a (13.Flotow H. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9126-9128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Flotow H. Graves P.R. Wang A.Q. Fiol C.J. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14264-14269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several protein kinases have been reported to phosphorylate site 2 in vitro, among them PKA, CaMKII, PKC, AMPK, GPhK, and MAPKAPKII (15.Carling D. Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1012: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16.Huang T.S. Krebs E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 75: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17.Roach P.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Larner J. J. Cyclic Nucleotide. Res. 1978; 4: 245-257PubMed Google Scholar). At the COOH terminus of muscle GS, there are at least seven phosphorylation sites; sites 3a (Ser640), 3b (Ser644), 3c (Ser648), 4 (Ser652), 5 (Ser656), 1a (Ser697), and 1b (Ser710). Sites 3, 4, and 5 are phosphorylated in a hierarchal mode. Casein kinase II phosphorylates site 5, establishing a recognition motif for GSK-3 to phosphorylate sequentially sites 4, 3c, 3b, and 3a (18.DePaoli-Roach A.A. Ahmad Z. Camici M. Lawrence Jr., J.C.

Dephosphorylation of sites 2 and 3 increase GS intrinsic activity much more than dephosphorylation of the remaining sites, which have little or no effect on the enzyme activity (22.Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of GS phosphorylation at sites 1a and 1b remains elusive. G6P binding reverses covalent inactivation of GS by phosphorylation (11.Rothman-Denes L.B. Cabib E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and increases susceptibility of the enzyme to be activated by the action of protein phosphatases (23.Villar-Palasi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), mainly by glycogen-targeted protein phosphatase 1. Intracellular compartmentalization of GS has been reported in several studies. In isolated hepatocytes, incubation with glucose induces GS activation and intracellular translocation to the cell periphery (24.Fernández-Novell J.M. Bellido D. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the absence of glucose, GS has been shown to be mainly located inside the nucleus of both cultured liver and muscle cells; however, following addition of glucose GS translocates to the cytosol (25.Ferrer J.C. Baqué S. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we reported a novel regulatory mechanism of skeletal muscle glycogen metabolism (26.Prats C. Cadefau J.A. Cussó R. Qvortrup K. Nielsen J.N. Wojtaszewki J.F. Wojtaszewki J.F. Hardie D.G. Stewart G. Hansen B.F. Ploug T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23165-23172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We showed that severe glycogen depletion induced by muscle contraction leads to rearrangement of cytoskeleton actin filaments to form dynamic intracellular compartments. Both GS and phosphorylase associate with such compartments to start glycogen re-synthesis. Furthermore, we showed that GS phosphorylated at site 1b (P-GS1b) was located at the cross-striations, the I-band of sarcomeres, whereas when phosphorylated at sites 2+2a (P-GS2+2a), GS formed some clusters homogeneously distributed along muscle fibers. In the present study we investigate the existence and relevance of such regulatory mechanism in human muscle metabolism. Ten healthy young well trained male subjects (age 26 ± 1 years, body mass index of 24.4 ± 0.7 kg · m−2 and VO2max of 57 ± 2 ml of O2 · (min · kg)−1 were included in the study; all subjects gave verbal and written consent to participate. The study was approved by the ethical committee of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg municipality (01-257174) and adhered to the Helsinki Declaration. The experiment was performed on two consecutive days. On day 1 a leg was randomly appointed as the glycogen pre-depleted leg, and this leg completed a glycogen depletion exercise protocol using a knee extension ergometer (27.Andersen P. Adams R.P. Sjøgaard G. Thorboe A. Saltin B. J. Appl. Physiol. 1985; 59: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The protocol consisted of a 30-min warm-up exercise (50% Wmax) followed by a total of 39 consecutive 3-min intervals of kicking at maximal sustainable workload. Between each working interval, subjects were allowed to rest for 2 min by kicking at 0% Wmax. When unable to complete the working interval, the workload was lowered 5%. Afterward subjects performed 1 h of arm cranking at 75% of maximal heart rate using an Angio arm ergometer (Lode BV, Groningen, The Netherlands) to decrease upper-body muscles and liver glycogen stores. Thereafter, subjects went home and were only allowed to eat 6500 kJ of a standardized meal containing 25% energy (E%) protein, 5 E% carbohydrate, and 70 E% fat until the next day. On day 2, the subjects returned overnight fasted, muscle biopsies were obtained from vastus lateralis (VL) muscle, as previously described (28.Bergström J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1962; 14 (Suppl. 68): 11-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, subjects initiated an exhausting exercise protocol, which started as a two-leg knee extensor exercise at 85% of Wmax. Blood samples were collected every 30 min until and at exhaustion. After 60 min of exercise the workload was increased to 90% Wmax, after 90 min to 95% Wmax, after 105 min to 100% Wmax, and after 120 min to 105% Wmax until exhaustion. At exhaustion of the first leg, exercise was stopped and a muscle biopsy was obtained, after that the unexhausted leg kept on kicking until exhaustion, when a biopsy from the second exhausted VL muscle was taken. All subjects but one exhausted the pre-depleted leg before the control leg. Subjects were then moved to a bed where they ingested 1 g of glucose per kilogram of body mass dissolved in 500 ml of water. After 30 min of rest, a muscle biopsy was obtained from the pre-depleted leg and, immediately after, subjects consumed a high glycemic index sandwich (1 g of glucose per kilogram of body mass). After 120 min of rest a final pre-depleted muscle biopsy was obtained. Throughout the experiment, subjects were allowed unlimited access to water and were encouraged to drink. Blood for determination of plasma glucose were analyzed using conventional commercially available assays on an automatic analyzer (Hitachi, 612 Automatic Analyzer, and Roche Applied Science). Plasma insulin concentrations were determined by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DakoCytomation, Great Britain). Arterial plasma epinephrine concentrations were determined by a commercial radioimmunoassay (High Sensitive 2 CAT RIA, Labor Diagnostika, Nord, Germany). After the biopsies were excised the tissue was carefully dissected and a fraction was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, whereas a second fraction was immersed in cold Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing procaine hydrochloride (1 g/liter) for 5 min and either fixed for light or electron microscopy analysis (29.Stefanini M. De Martino C. Zamboni L. Nature. 1967; 216: 173-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 30.Ploug T. van Deurs B. Ai H. Cushman S.W. Ralston E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1429-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Muscle glycogen was measured as previously described (31.Prats C. Bernal C. Cadefau J.A. Frias J. Tibolla M. Cusso R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Muscle GS activity was measured in triplicates using a 96-well plate assay (Unifilter 350 Plates, Whatman, Cambridge, UK) (36.Meyer F. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Haschke R.H. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6642-6648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GS activity was determined in the presence of 8, 0.17, or 0.02 mm G6P and reported as %GSI (100 × [activity (0.02 mm G6P)/activity (8 mm G6P)]) or as %FV (100 × [activity (0.17 mm G6P)/activity (8 mm G6P)]). Muscle proteins were separated using 7.5% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad, Denmark), and transferred (semi-dry) to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon Transfer Membrane, Millipore A/S, Denmark) (32.Højlund K. Glintborg D. Andersen N.R. Birk J.B. Treebak J.T. Frøsig C. Beck-Nielsen H. Wojtaszewski J.F. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used for Western blotting: Anti-GS was a polyclonal rabbit antibody (32.Højlund K. Glintborg D. Andersen N.R. Birk J.B. Treebak J.T. Frøsig C. Beck-Nielsen H. Wojtaszewski J.F. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For detection of P-GS3a+3b, P-GS2, P-GS2+2a, P-GS1a, and P-GS1b, antibodies were raised against different peptides as described (26.Prats C. Cadefau J.A. Cussó R. Qvortrup K. Nielsen J.N. Wojtaszewki J.F. Wojtaszewki J.F. Hardie D.G. Stewart G. Hansen B.F. Ploug T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23165-23172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33.Höjlund K.

The specificity of these antibodies has previously been reported (33.Höjlund K. Staehr P. Hansen B.F. Green K.A. Hardie D.G. Richter E.A. Beck-Nielsen H. Wojtaszewski J.F.P. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1393-13402Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The antibody against P-GS3a was purchased from Cell Signaling. This was performed as previously described (26.Prats C. Cadefau J.A. Cussó R. Qvortrup K. Nielsen J.N. Wojtaszewki J.F. Wojtaszewki J.F. Hardie D.G. Stewart G. Hansen B.F. Ploug T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23165-23172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Total GS was immunodetected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam) or a rabbit antibody raised against a synthetic peptide containing the last nine monoacids from human muscle GS: 729TSSLGEERN737 (A gift from Prof. Joan J. Ginovart). GS phosphorylated at sites 1a, 1b, 2, 2+2a, or 3a+3b were immunodetected using the same phospho-specific antibodies as for Western blotting. Secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 (Invitrogen) were used. All antibodies were diluted in 50 mm glycine, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.03% saponin, and 0.05% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline. Between incubation periods, muscle fibers were washed with the same buffer, but the last wash was performed with phosphate-buffered saline. Negative controls for each of the staining conditions were performed by staining without primary antibody or without primary and secondary antibodies. Muscle fibers were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium and analyzed. Confocal images were collected with a TCS SP2 microscope (Leica) using a Plan-Apo ×63/1.32 oil objective at 20 °C. Imaging settings were set so that no signal was detected in the respective negative controls and a low fraction of pixels showed saturation intensity values. Confocal z-stack images were collected from the surface to the center of muscle fibers, spaced 0.35 μm apart in the z-plane. Projections of four z-planes were constructed and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). To perform immunogold labeling of P-GS1b or P-GS2+2a, single muscle fibers were isolated, and immunohistochemistry was performed as described above. Secondary antibodies conjugated to nano-gold particles (Nanoprobes) were used. After the final wash single muscle fibers were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 h, washed 3 × 5 min with 0.1 m Sorensen buffer (pH 7.4) (34.Dawson D.J. Nichol L.W. Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1969; 22: 247-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 3 × 5 min with milliQ H2O. Silver enhancement (Nanoprobes) was performed, and muscle fibers were postfixed with 1% osmium in 0.1 m Sorensen buffer (pH 7.4) for 20 min. Muscle fibers were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, transferred to propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon according to standard procedures. Ultrathin sections were cut with a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E microtome and collected on one-hole copper grids with Formvar supporting membranes. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Phillips CM 100 transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Images were collected using a Megaview 2 camera and processed with the Analysis software package. The data were analyzed using SigmaStat software. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance test was used to assess statistical significance of the difference between groups. The linear dependence between different groups of data was assessed by the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Ten healthy young subjects performed a glycogen depletion exercise protocol with one leg, the pre-depleted leg. Liver and upper-body muscle glycogen storages were also depleted by using an arm cranking exercise protocol. Subjects went home and were only allowed to eat a low carbohydrate meal. Next day, subjects were asked to perform an exhausting exercise with both legs. Subjects were then given a high glucose drink at the end of the exhausting exercise and a high CHO sandwich after 30 min rest. Blood samples were collected before and after exhausting exercise and after 30, 60, 90 and 120 min of rest. Glucose, insulin and epinephrine blood concentrations were measured (Fig. 1, left panel). During exhausting exercise, epinephrine increased from 0.43 ± 0.05 to 2.55 ± 0.21 nmol·liter−1, and gradually reversed to basal levels after 120 min rest. Glucose levels remained constant during exhausting exercise. Insulin decreased from 23.2 ± 2.0 to 9.8 ± 1.3 pmol·liter−1 (p < 0.05) during exhausting exercise. Thirty minutes after the ingestion of glucose drink, glucose and insulin levels increased to 9.1 ± 0.33 mmol·liter−1 (p < 0.001) and 183.5 ± 15.2 pmol·liter−1 (p < 0.0001), respectively. At this point subjects were asked to eat a high CHO sandwich. Thirty minutes later, glucose levels had further increased to 11.0 ± 0.46 mmol·liter−1, while plasma insulin concentration had increased to 355.7 ± 19.2 pmol·liter−1, remaining both significantly increased after 120 min of rest (Fig. 1, left panel). VL muscle biopsies from both legs were obtained before and after exhausting exercise, 30 min after the ingestion of the glucose drink and 90 min after the ingestion of the high CHO sandwich biopsies were taken from the pre-depleted muscle. Before starting the exhausting exercise, glycogen content in VL muscle was significantly lower in the pre-depleted compared with the control muscle, 180.0 ± 12.3 and 370.0 ± 24.4 nmol glc·(mg dry weight)−1 (p < 0.0005), respectively (Fig. 1, right panel). After exhausting exercise, glycogen levels further decreased 54 and 47% in control and pre-depleted muscle, respectively. Glycogen content in exhausted pre-depleted muscle was 75% lower than in basal control (p < 0.0005). After 30 min of rest, glycogen levels had increased from 95 ± 14.3 to 124.5 ± 12.5 nmol glc·(mg dry weight)−1, but a statistically significant glycogen re-synthesis (185.0 ± 8.8 nmol glc·(mg dry weight)−1) was first detected after 120 min rest (Fig. 1, right panel). GS activity was measured in the presence of 8 mm, 0.17 mm, and 0.02 mm G6P. From these, the percentage of fractional velocity (%FV) and of GSI form (%GSI) were calculated. In control muscle, GS was activated by exercise detected both as increased %FV (from 30.2 ± 2.9 to 51.8 ± 5.5% (p < 0.005)) and %GSI (from 20.6 ± 2.0 to 40.4 ± 4.4% (p < 0.005)) (Fig. 1, right panel). Before exhausting exercise, pre-depleted muscle had markedly higher GS activity compared with control muscle, with 62.3 ± 3.8%FV and 51.2 ± 4.4%GSI, respectively (Fig. 1, right panel). No significant changes in total GS protein or phosphorylation at sites 1a and 2 were detected at any of the studied time points (Fig. 2). After exhausting exercise of control muscle, GS phosphorylation at site 1b significantly increased (p < 0.05), while phosphorylation at site 3a decreased (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2). Before the start of the exhausting exercise, GS phosphorylation at sites 2+2a, 3a, and 3a+3b was significantly lower in the pre-depleted muscle compared with the controls. As in the controls, exhausting exercise of pre-depleted muscle also lead to increased GS phosphorylation at site 1b (p < 0.05). Note that, even though the glycogen level in basal pre-depleted muscle was 51% lower than in basal controls (Fig. 1, right panel) in both groups exhausting exercise induced a similar increase in GS phosphorylation at site 1b. In addition, exhausting exercise of pre-depleted muscle induced a further 40% decrease in GS phosphorylation at GS site 3a+3b (p < 0.05). Analysis of the interdependency between GS activation state and glycogen content (Fig. 3A), shows a clear strong inverse correlation between %FV and glycogen content (p < 0.0001) and between %GSI and glycogen content (p < 0.0001). GS activity in the presence of 8 mm G6P is considered the total enzyme activity, whereas in the presence of 0.17 mm only intermediate phosphorylated forms and completely dephosphorylated forms of GS contributed to activity. In the presence of 0.02 mm G6P only highly dephosphorylated forms of GS were active. The results show that GS activity in the presence of 0.17 or 0.02 mm G6P was highly dependent on the phosphorylation state at sites 2+2a, 3a, and 3a+3b (Fig. 3B, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, analysis of the interdependency between GS phosphorylation at the different sites and muscle glycogen content (Fig. 3C) shows a strong positive correlation between glycogen levels and GS phosphorylation at sites 2+2a, 3a, and 3a+3b. A three-dimensional graph plotting glycogen content versus phosphorylation at sites 2+2a and 3a+3b displays the strong direct and linear interdependency between the three variables (Fig. 3D). Phospho-specific antibodies against GS sites 1b, 1a, 2, 2+2a, 3a, and 3a+3b were used to investigate their intracellular distribution in human VL muscle. When phosphorylated at sites 1a, 2, 3a, or/and 3a+3b, GS was found in several intracellular regions, as the total GS distribution, showing a striated and a dotted pattern of distribution and associated with some cellular compartment found at the perinuclear regions (Fig. 4, top panel). In contrast, P-GS1b is specifically found at the muscle striations, while P-GS2+2a presents a dotted pattern of distribution, forming cluster-like structures throughout muscle fibers (Fig. 4, lower panel). These observations are in agreement with our previous study in rabbit skeletal muscle, where the same specific intracellular distribution of P-GS1b and P-GS2+2a was observed (26.Prats C. Cadefau J.A. Cussó R. Qvortrup K. Nielsen J.N. Wojtaszewki J.F. Wojtaszewki J.F. Hardie D.G. Stewart G. Hansen B.F. Ploug T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23165-23172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Control single muscle fibers were immunostained against P-GS1b or P-GS2+2a. The staining was detected with nano-gold and silver enhanced for transmission electron microscopy. Representative images of P-GS1b and P-GS2+2a distribution are shown in Fig. 5. The results show that both phospho-specific forms of GS are associated with glycogen particles, the diameter of which is ∼25 nm (Fig. 5, C and G, arrows) agreeing with previously reported data (35.Marchand I. Chorneyko K. Tarnopolsky M. Hamilton S. Shearer J. Potvin J. Graham T.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 93: 1598-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 36.Meyer F. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Haschke R.H. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6642-6648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GS phospho-specific intracellular distribution responds to differential binding of GS with two pools of glycogen particles depending on its phosphorylation state. P-GS1b is mainly found associated with intramyofibrillar glycogen particles (Fig. 5, A and B), while P-GS2+2a is mainly associated with glycogen particles accumulated in the cytoplasm between the myofibrils, intermyofibrillar particles (Fig. 5, D–F). Note that immunolabeling against P-GS shows several silver enhanced nano-gold particles in each glycogen particle. GS intracellular distribution was investigated using fluorescence immunocytochemistry in single muscle fibers. In basal control fibers, GS presents a diffused pattern of distribution, particularly in the cross-striations and around the myonuclei (Fig. 6A). After exhausting exercise of control legs GS distribution changes from a diffuse to a more prominently striated pattern, indicating GS translocation to myofilaments in response to exhausting exercise (Fig. 6B). In exhausted pre-depleted muscle fibers, GS was found both in the striations as some spherical clusters and around myonuclei (Fig. 6C). Already before the exhausting exercise in some muscle fibers from pre-depleted muscle, which had been depleted of glycogen the day before and had been kept without glucose supply, GS was found associated with similar spherical clusters with a diameter of 200–500 nm. After exhausting exercise glycogen re-synthesis was investigated in pre-depleted legs. Thirty minutes after the end of exhausting exercise and the ingestion of a high glucose drink, GS was mainly detected associated with spherical particles at the striations of sarcomeres (Fig. 6D, lower panel). Our results show that GS intrinsic activity is strongly associated with glycogen levels (Fig. 3A), supporting the hypothesis that GS is regulated through negative feedback by glycogen (37.Danforth W.H.

https://openalex.org/W2045610809,"Background Transmission mechanisms of black-band disease (BBD) in coral reefs are poorly understood, although this disease is considered to be one of the most widespread and destructive coral infectious diseases. The major objective of this study was to assess transmission mechanisms of BBD in the field based on the spatio-temporal patterns of the disease. Methodology/Principal Findings 3,175 susceptible and infected corals were mapped over an area of 10×10 m in Eilat (northern Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea) and the distribution of the disease was examined monthly throughout almost two full disease cycles (June 2006–December 2007). Spatial and spatio-temporal analyses were applied to infer the transmission pattern of the disease and to calculate key epidemiological parameters such as (basic reproduction number). We show that the prevalence of the disease is strongly associated with high water temperature. When water temperatures rise and disease prevalence increases, infected corals exhibit aggregated distributions on small spatial scales of up to 1.9 m. Additionally, newly-infected corals clearly appear in proximity to existing infected corals and in a few cases in direct contact with them. We also present and test a model of water-borne infection, indicating that the likelihood of a susceptible coral becoming infected is defined by its spatial location and by the relative spatial distribution of nearby infected corals found in the site. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide evidence that local transmission, but not necessarily by direct contact, is likely to be an important factor in the spread of the disease over the tested spatial scale. In the absence of potential disease vectors with limited mobility (e.g., snails, fireworms) in the studied site, water-borne infection is likely to be a significant transmission mechanism of BBD. Our suggested model of water-borne transmission supports this hypothesis. The spatio-temporal analysis also points out that infected corals surviving a disease season appear to play a major role in the re-introduction of the disease to the coral community in the following season."
https://openalex.org/W2017115394,"Background One central question in the context of motor control and action monitoring is at what point in time errors can be detected. Previous electrophysiological studies investigating this issue focused on brain potentials elicited after erroneous responses, mainly in simple speeded response tasks. In the present study, we investigated brain potentials before the commission of errors in a natural and complex situation. Methodology/Principal Findings Expert pianists bimanually played scales and patterns while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were computed for correct and incorrect performances. Results revealed differences already 100 ms prior to the onset of a note (i.e., prior to auditory feedback). We further observed that erroneous keystrokes were delayed in time and pressed more slowly. Conclusions Our data reveal neural mechanisms in musicians that are able to detect errors prior to the execution of erroneous movements. The underlying mechanism probably relies on predictive control processes that compare the predicted outcome of an action with the action goal."
https://openalex.org/W1982234546,"Background More than 80% of mammalian protein-coding genes are driven by TATA-less promoters which often show multiple transcriptional start sites (TSSs). However, little is known about the core promoter DNA sequences or mechanisms of transcriptional initiation for this class of promoters. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we identify a new core promoter element XCPE2 (X core promoter element 2) (consensus sequence: A/C/G-C-C/T-C-G/A-T-T-G/A-C-C/A+1-C/T) that can direct specific transcription from the second TSS of hepatitis B virus X gene mRNA. XCPE2 sequences can also be found in human promoter regions and typically appear to drive one of the start sites within multiple TSS-containing TATA-less promoters. To gain insight into mechanisms of transcriptional initiation from this class of promoters, we examined requirements of several general transcription factors by in vitro transcription experiments using immunodepleted nuclear extracts and purified factors. Our results show that XCPE2-driven transcription uses at least TFIIB, either TFIID or free TBP, RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and the MED26-containing mediator complex but not Gcn5. Therefore, XCPE2-driven transcription can be carried out by a mechanism which differs from previously described TAF-dependent mechanisms for initiator (Inr)- or downstream promoter element (DPE)-containing promoters, the TBP- and SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase)-dependent mechanism for yeast TATA-containing promoters, or the TFTC (TBP-free-TAF-containing complex)-dependent mechanism for certain Inr-containing TATA-less promoters. EMSA assays using XCPE2 promoter and purified factors further suggest that XCPE2 promoter recognition requires a set of factors different from those for TATA box, Inr, or DPE promoter recognition. Conclusions/Significance We identified a new core promoter element XCPE2 that are found in multiple TSS-containing TATA-less promoters. Mechanisms of promoter recognition and transcriptional initiation for XCPE2-driven promoters appear different from previously shown mechanisms for classical promoters that show single “focused” TSSs. Our studies provide insight into novel mechanisms of RNA Pol II transcription from multiple TSS-containing TATA-less promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2164951109,"Polyubiquitylation targets multiple proteins for degradation by the proteasome. Typically, the first ubiquitin is linked to lysine residues in the substrate for degradation via an isopeptide bond, although rarely ubiquitin linkage to the N-terminal residue has also been observed. We have recently shown that Neurogenin (NGN), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that plays a central role in regulating neuronal differentiation, is degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We have taken a biochemical and mutagenesis approach to investigate sites of ubiquitylation of NGN, initially using extracts of eggs from the frog Xenopus laevis as a source of ubiquitylation and degradation components. NGN can be targeted for destruction by ubiquitylation via lysines or the N terminus. However, we see that a modified NGN, where canonical lysine ubiquitylation and N-terminally linked ubiquitylation are prevented, is nevertheless ubiquitylated and degraded by the proteasome. We show that polyubiquitin chains covalently attach to non-canonical cysteine residues in NGN, and these non-canonical linkages alone are capable of targeting NGN protein for destruction. Importantly, canonical and non-canonical ubiquitylation occurs simultaneously in the native protein and may differ in importance for driving degradation in interphase and mitosis. We conclude that native NGN is ubiquitylated on multiple canonical and non-canonical sites by cellular ubiquitin ligases, and all types of linkage can contribute to protein turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2101866220,"Cortical spreading depression (SD) has been suggested to underlie migraine aura. Despite a precise match in speed, the spatio-temporal patterns of SD observed in animal cortex and aura symptoms mapped to the cortical surface ordinarily differ in aspects of size and shape. We show that this mismatch is reconciled by utilizing that both pattern types bifurcate from an instability point of generic reaction-diffusion models. To classify these spatio-temporal pattern we suggest a susceptibility scale having the value sigma = 1 at the instability point. We predict that human cortex is only weakly susceptible to SD (sigma<1), and support this prediction by directly matching visual aura symptoms with anatomical landmarks using fMRI retinotopic mapping. Moreover, we use retinal SD to give a proof of concept of the existence of this instability point and describe how cortical susceptibility to SD must be adjusted for migraine drug testing. Close to the instability point at sigma = 1 the dynamical repertoire of cortical tissue is increased. As a consequence, the picture of an engulfing SD that became paradigmatic for migraine with aura needs to be modified in most cases towards a more spatially confined pattern that remains within the originating major gyrus or sulcus. Furthermore, we discuss the resulting implications on migraine pharmacology that is hitherto tested in the regime (sigma>1), and potentially silent aura occurring below a second bifurcation point at sigma = 0 on the susceptible scale."
https://openalex.org/W2110754873,"Background Variation in the behavioural repertoire of animals is acquired by learning in a range of animal species. In nest-building birds, the assemblage of nest materials in an appropriate structure is often typical of a bird genus or species. Yet plasticity in the selection of nest materials may be beneficial because the nature and abundance of nest materials vary across habitats. Such plasticity can be learned, either individually or socially. In Corsican populations of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, females regularly add in their nests fragments of several species of aromatic plants during the whole breeding period. The selected plants represent a small fraction of the species present in the environment and have positive effects on nestlings. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated spatiotemporal variations of this behaviour to test whether the aromatic plant species composition in nests depends on 1) plant availability in territories, 2) female experience or 3) female identity. Our results indicate that territory plays a very marginal role in the aromatic plant species composition of nests. Female experience is not related to a change in nest plant composition. Actually, this composition clearly depends on female identity, i.e. results from individual preferences which, furthermore, are repeatable both within and across years. A puzzling fact is the strong difference in plant species composition of nests across distinct study plots. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that plant species composition of nests results from individual preferences that are homogeneous within study plots. We propose several hypotheses to interpret this pattern of spatial variation before discussing them in the light of preliminary results. As a conclusion, we cannot exclude the possibility of social transmission of individual preferences for aromatic plants. This is an exciting perspective for further work in birds, where nest construction behaviour has classically been considered as a stereotypic behaviour."

In order to elucidate the intricate network of NLR signaling, which is still fragmentary in molecular terms, we applied comprehensive yeast two-hybrid analysis for unbiased evaluation of physical interactions between NLRs and their adaptors (ASC, CARD8) as well as kinase RIPK2 and inflammatory caspases (C1, C2, C4, C5) under identical conditions. Our results confirmed the interaction of NOD1 and NOD2 with RIPK2, and between NLRP3 and ASC, but most importantly, our studies revealed hitherto unrecognized interactions of NOD2 with members of the NLRP subfamily. We found that NOD2 specifically and directly interacts with NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRP12. Furthermore, we observed homodimerization of the RIPK2 CARD domains and identified residues in NOD2 critical for interaction with RIPK2. In conclusion, our work provides further evidence for the complex network of protein-protein interactions underlying NLR function."
https://openalex.org/W1998666583,"The present study was undertaken to investigate the rate and mode of degradation of individual histatin proteins in whole saliva to establish the impact on its functional domains. Pure synthetic histatins 1, 3, and 5 were incubated with whole saliva supernatant as the enzyme source, and peptides in the resultant digests were separated by reverse-phase- HPLC and structurally characterized by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. The overall Vmax/Km ratios, a measure of proteolytic efficiency, were on the order of histatin-5 > histatin-3 > hista- tin-1. Mathematical models predict that histatins 1, 3, and 5 levels in whole saliva stabilize at 5.1, 1.9, and 1.2 μM, representing 59, 27, and 11% of glandular histatins 1, 3, and 5 levels, respectively. Monitoring of the appearance and disappearance of histatin fragments yielded the identification of the first targeted enzymatic cleavage sites as K13 and K17 in histatin 1, R22, Y24, and R25 in histatin 3, and Y10, K11, R12, K13, H15, E16, K17, and H18 in histatin 5.

https://openalex.org/W2009970673,"The crystal structure of the complex of lactoperoxidase (LPO) with its physiological substrate thiocyanate (SCN(-)) has been determined at 2.4A resolution. It revealed that the SCN(-) ion is bound to LPO in the distal heme cavity. The observed orientation of the SCN(-) ion shows that the sulfur atom is closer to the heme iron than the nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atom of SCN(-) forms a hydrogen bond with a water (Wat) molecule at position 6'. This water molecule is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds with Gln(423) N(epsilon2) and Phe(422) oxygen. In contrast, the placement of the SCN(-) ion in the structure of myeloperoxidase (MPO) occurs with an opposite orientation, in which the nitrogen atom is closer to the heme iron than the sulfur atom. The site corresponding to the positions of Gln(423), Phe(422) oxygen, and Wat(6)' in LPO is occupied primarily by the side chain of Phe(407) in MPO due to an entirely different conformation of the loop corresponding to the segment Arg(418)-Phe(431) of LPO. This arrangement in MPO does not favor a similar orientation of the SCN(-) ion. The orientation of the catalytic product OSCN(-) as reported in the structure of LPO.OSCN(-) is similar to the orientation of SCN(-) in the structure of LPO.SCN(-). Similarly, in the structure of LPO.SCN(-).CN(-), in which CN(-) binds at Wat(1), the position and orientation of the SCN(-) ion are also identical to that observed in the structure of LPO.SCN."
https://openalex.org/W2090747149,"The bacterium Streptomyces anulatus 9663, isolated from the intestine of different arthropods, produces prenylated derivatives of phenazine 1-carboxylic acid. From this organism, we have identified the prenyltransferase gene ppzP. ppzP resides in a gene cluster containing orthologs of all genes known to be involved in phenazine 1-carboxylic acid biosynthesis in Pseudomonas strains as well as genes for the six enzymes required to generate dimethylallyl diphosphate via the mevalonate pathway. This is the first complete gene cluster of a phenazine natural compound from streptomycetes. Heterologous expression of this cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M512 resulted in the formation of prenylated derivatives of phenazine 1-carboxylic acid. After inactivation of ppzP, only nonprenylated phenazine 1-carboxylic acid was formed. Cloning, overexpression, and purification of PpzP resulted in a 37-kDa soluble protein, which was identified as a 5,10-dihydrophenazine 1-carboxylate dimethylallyltransferase, forming a C-C bond between C-1 of the isoprenoid substrate and C-9 of the aromatic substrate. In contrast to many other prenyltransferases, the reaction of PpzP is independent of the presence of magnesium or other divalent cations. The K(m) value for dimethylallyl diphosphate was determined as 116 microm. For dihydro-PCA, half-maximal velocity was observed at 35 microm. K(cat) was calculated as 0.435 s(-1). PpzP shows obvious sequence similarity to a recently discovered family of prenyltransferases with aromatic substrates, the ABBA prenyltransferases. The present finding extends the substrate range of this family, previously limited to phenolic compounds, to include also phenazine derivatives."

Mitochondria are primary sites of energy consumption of most cells. Increased plasma insulin level and mitochondrial dysfunction are features of insulin resistance.

Insulin is a central regulator of metabolism of glucose, fat, and proteins. It promotes anabolism while inhibiting catabolism of all nutrients, i.e. insulin converts ingested nutrients into glycogen, fat, and proteins while preventing breakdown of stored glycogen, fat, and protein into glucose, free fatty acids, and amino acids to be consumed. Therefore, the primary function of insulin in metabolism is to store energy and prevent energy consumption. This is evidenced by the fact that, in the absence of insulin signaling, ingested calories cannot be stored efficiently (1Bluher M. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Evolutionarily, the extremely high efficiency of insulin in storing energy was essential for survival because food was not always available. However, food has become abundant due to modern technologies; and people tend to intake more calories than they spend. Insulin converts every excess calorie into storage primarily as fat initially in adipose tissue and eventually in non-adipose tissues. When fat accumulation, in particular ectopic fat accumulation in liver and skeletal muscles, reaches a certain level, insulin signaling will be desensitized (2Accili D. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3Kim J.Y. van de Wall E. Laplante M. Azzara A. Trujillo M.E. Hofmann S.M. Schraw T. Durand J.L. Li H. Li G. Jelicks L.A.

As a result, hyperinsulinemia ensues to overcome insulin resistance and drive excess nutrients away from blood into storage primarily as fat, whereas maintaining blood glucose level normal via the Akt-dependent insulin signaling pathway. This pernicious cycle among fat accumulation (in particular ectopic fat accumulation), hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance may cause a variety of health problems associated with the life style that is featured by overeating and/or sedentary, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, degenerative neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer disease, cancers, and accelerated aging (2Accili D.

Wolf N. Poot M. Cytometry A. 2004; 61: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Twelve hours after isolation, hepatocytes were treated with insulin (10 or 100 nm) for 12–24 h. Cells were then incubated in the dark with media containing 75 nm MitoTracker Green for 60 min at 37 °C. After staining, cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation at 1600 × g for 2 min. Cell pellets were washed once with 0.4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence intensity of cells was quantified immediately by flow cytometric scanning (fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FL-1 setting; 10,000 events/analysis) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). No-dye (without adding MitoTracker Green FM) negative control was used to remove the background. RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR—Total RNAs were extracted from cells or tissues with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and reverse transcribed into cDNAs, which were quantified by TaqMan® real-time PCR with specific probes and primers listed in supplemental Table S1, and normalized to levels of β-actin. Measurement of Mitochondrial DNA—Total DNA was extracted from tissues or cultured cells using the Qiagen DNA extraction kit. DNA concentrations were determined by NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). One ng of total DNA was used to determine the ratio of mitochondrial cyclooxygenase (COXII) to nuclear intron of β-globin by real-time PCR using the oligos listed under supplemental Table S2 (30Cunningham J.T. Rodgers J.T. Arlow D.H. Vazquez F. Mootha V.K. Puigserver P. Nature. 2007; 450: 736-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Data were verified by measuring the ratio of cytochrome b to glucagon of the same sample. Measurement of Oxygen Consumption—Oxygen consumption was measured in primary hepatocytes using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, England) as previously described with modifications (31Matthias A.

Twelve hours after their isolation, cells were treated with insulin (10 or 100 nm) for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized and collected by centrifugation at 1600 × g for 2 min. Basal respiration of each sample was analyzed by incubating 1 × 106 cells with 1 ml of Wilson media containing 25 mm HEPES and 2% bovine serum albumin-free fatty acids (pH 7.4) in a magnetically stirred chamber at 37 °C. Measurements of cAMP and cGMP—Mouse hepa1c1c7 hepatoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (4.5 g/liter) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were pre-treated with 0.25 mm IBMX for 30 min followed by a 24-h exposure to insulin at concentrations noted in the continuous presence or absence of IBMX. Intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP were measured with Biotrak Enzyme immunoassay systems (Amersham). Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates (15 μg/lane) were resolved in 4–20% Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Target proteins were detected by immunoblotting with primary antibodies as indicated and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antisera. Fluorescent bands were visualized with a Typhoon 9410 variable mode Imager from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ), and then quantified by densitometry analysis using ImageQuant 5.2 software from GE Healthcare. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by Student's t test with GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows (San Diego, CA). Differences at values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Mitochondrial Production Is Increased in Mice with STZ-induced T1DM—To determine the effect of insulin on mitochondrial production, insulin deficiency (T1DM) was induced in B6 mice, followed by evaluation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), mitochondrial number, and expression levels (protein and mRNA) of genes that are involved in mitochondrial production. As shown in Fig. 1A, frank diabetes (hyperglycemia) was induced in mice by administration of STZ. The mtDNA level was significantly increased in the liver but not in the gastrocnemius of mice with T1DM (Fig. 1B). Mitochondrial number in liver evaluated by electron microscopy was also significantly elevated in T1DM (Fig. 1, C and D). Protein levels of NRF1, PGC-1α, and cytochrome c were all increased in liver of mice with T1DM (Fig. 2). Transcript levels of many mitochondrion-associated genes were elevated in liver and gastrocnemius from mice with T1DM (Table. 1). Together, these results imply that the mitochondrial production program is increased in the absence of insulin. Because plasma levels of all nutrients including glucose, amino acids, and free fatty acids are inevitably increased in the absence of insulin; and all nutrients can influence mitochondrial biogenesis (30Cunningham J.T.

Open table in a new tab Prolonged Exposure of Primary Hepatocytes to Insulin Decreases Mitochondrial Mass, mtDNA, ATP Content, and Cellular O2 Consumption—To examine the direct effect of insulin on mitochondrial production and function, hepatocytes isolated from normal mice were incubated with insulin for either 12 or 24 h, followed by measurements of mitochondrial mass, mtDNA, intracellular ATP content, and cellular O2 consumption. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, incubation with insulin at either 10 or 100 nm for 24 h significantly decreased the mitochondrial mass, whereas incubation with insulin for 12 h decreased mitochondrial mass without reaching statistical significance (also see supplemental Fig. 1). Incubation of hepatocytes with insulin for 24 h decreased the mitochondrial DNA level (Fig. 3C). Similarly, intracellular ATP content was reduced by incubation with insulin for 24 h (Fig. 3D). Cellular O2 consumption was reduced by exposure of hepatocytes to insulin at 100 nm for 24 h although similar exposure to insulin at 10 nm did not alter cellular O2 consumption (Fig. 3E). Together, these results indicate that mitochondrial production and function were decreased by prolonged exposure to insulin. Prolonged Exposure of Primary Hepatocytes to Insulin Decreases Expression Levels of Genes Associated with Mitochondrial Production and Fat (β) Oxidation while Increasing Transcript Levels of Lipogenic Genes—To further determine the effect of insulin on mitochondrial production, primary hepatocytes were incubated with insulin for 24 h, followed by measurements of gene transcripts with real-time PCR. As shown in Table 2, many mitochondrion-related genes including ATP synthase (ATP5a1), NADH dehydrogenase (Ndufv1), postaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (COXI), succinate dehydrogenase (Sdhc), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) were decreased by exposure to insulin. The PGC-1α transcript level was not altered, whereas the PGC-1β transcript level was increased by incubation with insulin. Protein levels of NRF-1 and TFAM was also decreased by prolonged exposure to insulin (Fig. 4). Transcript levels of key genes involved in β-oxidation were decreased by incubation with insulin (Table 2). These genes include carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT-1a, Cpt1a), medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadm), long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadl), and very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadvl). Conversely, transcript levels of some key lipogenic genes including sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), SREBP-2, and fatty acid synthase (Fasn) were increased by incubation with insulin (Table 2). Together, these results indicate that mitochondrial production and fat oxidation programs are suppressed, whereas the hepatic lipogenic program is increased by insulin.TABLE 2Levels of gene transcripts in primary hepatocytes that were exposed to insulin (100 nM) for 24 hInsulin versus vehiclep valueATP5a10.698 ± 0.0407p < 0.0001ap < 0.001.COXIV0.941 ± 0.0280p < 0.0001ap < 0.001.Ndufv10.855 ± 0.0558p = 0.0141bp < 0.05.NRF10.746 ± 0.0168p = 0.0002ap < 0.001.PGC-1α0.958 ± 0.0702p = 0.4280PGC-1β2.494 ± 0.3528p < 0.0001ap < 0.001.COXI0.630 ± 0.0795p < 0.0001ap < 0.001.Sdhc0.884 ± 0.0628p = 0.0422bp < 0.05.Tfam0.704 ± 0.0548p < 0.0001ap < 0.001.CPT-1α0.324 ± 0.0582p = 0.0005ap < 0.001.Acadm0.796 ± 0.0495p = 0.0429bp < 0.05.Acadl0.833 ± 0.0074p = 0.0011cp < 0.01.Acadvl0.759 ± 0.0541p = 0.0116bp < 0.05.SREBP-12.444 ± 0.4861p = 0.0387bp < 0.05.SREBP-22.062 ± 0.3686p = 0.0255bp < 0.05.FAS1.408 ± 0.1338p = 0.0180bp < 0.05.Hmgcr1.971 ± 0.4452p = 0.0878a p < 0.001.b p < 0.05.c p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Insulin Reduction of Mitochondrial Production and Function Is Mediated by the Akt-dependent Classical Insulin Signaling Pathway—To examine the mechanism by which insulin influences mitochondrial production and function, hepatocytes were incubated with insulin for 24 h in the presence or absence of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, followed by evaluation of levels of Akt phosphorylation, mitochondrial mass, mtDNA, intracellular ATP content, ATP synthase protein, and transcripts of mitochondrion-related genes. Application of LY294002 prevented insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation as expected (Fig. 5A). Insulin-mediated reductions in mitochondrial mass, mtDNA, and intracellular ATP were all prevented by LY294002 (Fig. 5, B–D). Similarly, ATP synthase protein level was decreased by prolonged exposure to insulin, but the decrease was reversed by LY294002 (Fig. 5E). As shown in Fig. 6, transcript levels of Ndufv1, Ptgs1, Atp5a1, Ctp1a, Nrf-1, and Tfam were reduced by incubation with insulin; and the reductions were reversed by pre-treatment with LY294002. Together, these results suggest that insulin suppression of mitochondrial mass, mtDNA, and intracellular ATP level is mediated by the Akt-dependent classical insulin signaling.FIGURE 6Insulin decreases transcript levels of mitochondrion-related genes through Akt-dependent insulin signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2091584186,"Manganese superoxide dismutase plays a role in breast tumor cell growth, which depends on its constitutive expression. However, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of constitutive SOD2 gene expression at different malignant phenotype in breast cancers remain to be determined. The present study reports the identification and characterization of a DNA sequence located in the proximal promoter of the SOD2 gene, which forms a complex with a nuclear protein from breast tumor MCF-7 cells. Purification of this complex showed that it contained DDB2 (damaged DNA binding 2), a well known protein involved in nucleotide excision DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Functional analysis of the proximal promoter of the SOD2 gene or modulation of DDB2 expression allowed us to demonstrate that DDB2 regulates negatively the constitutive expression of the SOD2 gene in breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that the binding of DDB2 was associated with the loss of acetylated H3 histones and the decrease in the binding of Sp1 but not AP-2alpha transcription factors to the SOD2 proximal promoter. In addition, we show that DDB2 exerts, at least in part, a control of breast cancer cell growth through its negative regulation of constitutive expression of the SOD2 gene. For the first time, these data give supporting evidence that DDB2 is a new transcriptional regulator, and they provide insight into the molecular function of breast cancer cell growth, which will have an important clinical interest."
https://openalex.org/W2077120971,"Cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is a physiological constituent of eukaryotic cells. The cellular pathways underlying prions spread from the sites of prions infection/peripheral replication to the central nervous system are still not elucidated. Membrane-derived microvesicles (MVs) are submicron (0.1-1 microm) particles, that are released by cells during plasma membrane shedding processes. They are usually liberated from different cell types, mainly upon activation as well as apoptosis, in this case, one of their hallmarks is the exposure of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the membrane. MVs are also characterized by the presence of adhesion molecules, MHC I molecules, as well as of membrane antigens typical of their cell of origin. Evidence exists that MVs shedding provide vehicles to transfer molecules among cells, and that MVs are important modulators of cell-to-cell communication. In this study we therefore analyzed the potential role of membrane-derived MVs in the mechanism(s) of PrP(C) diffusion and prion infectivity transmission. We first identified PrP(C) in association with the lipid raft components Fyn, flotillin-2, GM1 and GM3 in MVs from plasma of healthy human donors. Similar findings were found in MVs from cell culture supernatants of murine neuronal cells. Furthermore we demonstrated that PrP(Sc) is released from infected murine neuronal cells in association with plasma membrane-derived MVs and that PrP(Sc)-bearing MVs are infectious both in vitro and in vivo. The data suggest that MVs may contribute both to the intercellular mechanism(s) of PrP(C) diffusion and signaling as well as to the process of prion spread and neuroinvasion."
https://openalex.org/W2042259396,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) exhibit phenotypic plasticity and change from a quiescent contractile phenotype to a proliferative synthetic phenotype during physiological arteriogenesis and pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB is a potent inducer of the VSMC synthetic phenotype; however, much less is known about the role of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) in this process. Here, we show using signal transduction mutants of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) expressed in rat VSMC that the adaptor protein FRS2 is essential for FGFR1-mediated phenotypic modulation and down-regulation of VSMC smooth muscle α-actin (SMA) gene expression. In addition, we show that PDGF-BB and FGF2 act synergistically to induce cell proliferation and down-regulate SMA and SM22α in VSMC. Furthermore, we show that PDGF-BB induces tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1 and that this phosphorylation is mediated by PDGF receptor-β (PDGFRβ), but not c-Src. We demonstrate that FRS2 co-immunoprecipitates with PDGFRβ in a complex that requires FGFR1 and that both the extracellular and the intracellular domains of FGFR1 are required for association with PDGFRβ, whereas the cytoplasmic domain of FGFR1 is required for FRS2 association with the FGFR1-PDGFRβ complex. Knockdown of FRS2 in VSMC by RNA interference inhibited PDGF-BB-mediated down-regulation of SMA and SM22α without affecting PDGF-BB mediated cell proliferation or ERK activation. Together, these data support the notion that PDGFRβ down-regulates SMA and SM22α through formation of a complex that requires FGFR1 and FRS2 and prove novel insight into VSMC phenotypic plasticity.

During these processes VSMC change from a contractile phenotype to a synthetic phenotype characterized by increased proliferation, migration, increased extracellular matrix production, and decreased expression of contractile proteins, including smooth muscle α-actin (SMA), SM22α, calponin, and myosin heavy chain. Several growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and thrombin have been implicated in the induction of the synthetic phenotype (3.Millette E. Rauch B.H. Kenagy R.D. Daum G. Clowes A.W. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2006; 16: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These growth factors bind cell surface receptors and activate intracellular signaling pathways that result in changes in gene expression and cellular phenotype. Understanding the interactions between these pathways may provide insights into mechanisms of phenotypic modulation of VSMC and provide new targets for therapeutic intervention in vascular disease.Experimental evidence using various in vitro and in vivo models points to a role for FGF-FGFR in the phenotypic modulation of VSMC. FGFs and FGFRs are expressed in VSMC and are up-regulated during vascular injury and in atherosclerotic plaque formation (4.Brogi E. Winkles J.A. Underwood R. Clinton S.K. Alberts G.F. Libby P. J.

The up-regulation of FGF and FGFR suggests that they contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular disease. In support of this hypothesis, administration of anti-FGF2 antibodies and FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors results in decreased VSMC proliferation, migration, and attenuated neointimal thickening (7.Lindner V.

To determine the role of FRS2 in FGFR1-mediated VSMC phenotypic modulation and to determine the interaction of PDGFRβ with the FGFR1 signaling pathway, we developed a set of FGFR1 signaling pathway deficient mutants and stably expressed them in rat VSMC. In this study we report that PDGFRβ, FGFR1, and FRS2 form a multi-protein complex that is essential for VSMC phenotypic modulation and that stable knockdown of FRS2 inhibits PDGF-BB-mediated down-regulation of VSMC marker gene expression but not PDGF-BB-mediated VSMC proliferation.DISCUSSIONThe present study has identified a new mechanism by which PDGF-BB acts synergistically with FGF-2 in phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells from a contractile toward a synthetic phenotype characterized by a decrease in the expression of the smooth muscle marker genes SMA and SM22α. Evidence for this synergistic interaction includes: (i) FGF2 and PDGF-BB together result in a greater decrease in SMA and SM22α expression in VSMC than either one alone, and this correlates with a synergistic increase in VSMC proliferation; (ii) PDGF-BB induces tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1 and FRS2 to a similar extent as FGF2; (iii) PDGFRβ and FGFR1 form a tripartite complex with FRS2, which is required for maximal ERK activation; and (iv) shRNA-mediated knockdown of FRS2 results in abrogation of PDGF-BB-mediated down-regulation of VSMC marker gene expression, while leaving the proliferative response to PDGF-BB intact.The regulation of proliferation and smooth muscle marker gene expression in VSMC by PDGF-BB has been studied extensively; however, much less is known about the role of FGF2 in these processes. To study the role of FGFR1 signaling in VSMC and to avoid the confounding effects of heparan sulfate proteoglycans on FGF receptor signaling, we developed a constitutively activated FGFR1 with mutations that abolish signaling through specific pathways. These mutants eliminate the need for FGF2 stimulation, which will abrogate FGF-mediated signaling through syndecans (32.Allen B.L. Filla M.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 33.Rauch B.H. Millette E. Kenagy R.D. Daum G. Fischer J.W. Clowes A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17507-17511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and allows dissection of signaling via FGFR1. These constitutively active FGFR1 mutants reveal that the majority of ERK signaling occurs through FGFR1 interaction with FRS2, although low level ERK signaling occurred with FGFR1 K562E: −FRS2. There was strong concordance between FGFR1 mutants that had an intact FRS2-binding site and the down-regulation of smooth muscle marker gene expression. FRS2 also mediates the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through the formation of a FRS2-Gab1-PI3 kinase complex (12.Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Guy G.R. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6074-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation leads to activation of a signaling cascade of Akt, mTOR, and S6 kinase, resulting in suppression VSMC marker gene expression (1.Owens G.K. Novartis Found. Symp. 2007; 283: 174-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Rzucidlo E.M. Martin K.A. Powell R.J. J. Vasc. Surg. 2007; 45 (Suppl.

J. Vasc. Surg. 2007; 45 (Suppl. A): 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in PAC1 cells expressing the mutant FGFR1 K562E, there was a small decrease in Akt phosphorylation that differed little from FGFR1 K562E: −FRS2-expressing PAC1 cells (36.Chen P.Y. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 382: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, SMA luciferase reporter assays indicate that a dominant negative Akt was unable to reverse the down-regulation of smooth muscle marker gene expression in FGFR1 K562E PAC1 cells. Together, these data indicate that the major pathway mediating down-regulation of VSMC marker gene expression in FGFR1 K562E expressing PAC1 cells is via the ERK pathway. The ERK pathway also leads S6 kinase activation independent of mTOR (2.Rzucidlo E.M. Martin K.A. Powell R.J. J. Vasc. Surg. 2007; 45 (Suppl. A): 25-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), likely represents an additional pathway by which smooth muscle marker genes are down-regulated, and will require additional study.Once we established that FGFR1 signaling via FRS2 results in down-regulation of smooth muscle marker gene expression, we queried whether FGFR1 and PDGFRβ signaling pathways act synergistically to down-regulate VSMC marker gene expression. Treatment of VSMC with either FGF2 or PDGF-BB results in down-regulation of SMA and increased VSMC proliferation. In addition, when added together, FGF2 and PDGF-BB had a synergistic effect on both processes. Furthermore, PDGF-BB stimulation of BVSMC resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1 and FRS2 to the same extent as that of FGF2. Together, these data suggest cross-talk between these two pathways at the level of receptor-receptor interactions. Indeed, FGFR1 and PDGFRβ co-immunoprecipitate, and PDGFRβ is able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of a FGFR1 kinase-deficient mutant. This tyrosine phosphorylation was neither inhibited by DN-Src nor enhanced by a CA-Src, suggesting that the transactivation of FGFR1 by PDGFRβ is likely direct. This is in contrast to the transactivation of the PDGFRβ in VSMC by G-protein-coupled receptors, which is Src-dependent (29.Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1050-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).We next questioned whether FRS2 was an important component of FGFR1-PDGFRβ cross-talk. In 293T cells PDGFRβ D850N stimulated ERK phosphorylation and was significantly enhanced by the presence FRS2. The presence of FRS2 in PDGFRβ immunoprecipitates could be completely abrogated by co-transfection with a dominant negative FGFR1. Furthermore, in L6 myoblasts that are devoid of detectable FGFR but express PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, GST-FRS2αPTB did not pull down either PDGFR; however, in 293T cells expressing PDGFRβ the GST-FRS2αPTB efficiently pulled down a complex composed of FGFR1 and PDGFRβ, indicating that the association of PDGFRβ with FRS2 is indirect, through association with FGFR1. These data suggest a unique mechanism whereby FRS2 and FGFR1 contribute to the signaling output of PDGF-BB in the down-regulation of VSMC marker gene expression.Because PDGF-BB and FGF2 down-regulate smooth muscle marker gene expression in a synergistic manner and because FGFR1, PDGFRβ, and FRS2 form a multiprotein complex, we performed shRNA mediated knockdown of FRS2 to determine its contribution to PDGF-BB-mediated down-regulation of SMA and SM22α. We chose to target FRS2 for knockdown because it will likely abrogate signaling through FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 and eliminate the need to knockdown all FGFRs expressed in VSMC. Stable knockdown of FRS2 in two independent clones of PAC1 cells abrogated PDGF-BB-mediated down-regulation of SMA and SM22α. These data suggest that FGFR1 and FRS2 are major components of PDGF-BB-mediated signaling in the down-regulation of SMA and SM22α. Although we cannot rule out the direct activation of the Akt-mTOR-S6 kinase pathway by PDGFRβ in PAC1 VSMC, our data suggest that FRS2 via FGFR1 is a major regulator of VSMC phenotype and that ERK activation is a component of this regulation.VSMC proliferation is mediated in part via PDGF-BB-mediated activation of FGFR1 via the release of FGF2 (9.Millette E. Rauch B.H. Defawe O. Kenagy R.D. Daum G. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Sustained ERK activation is crucial to VSMC proliferation, and the early phase of ERK activation is mediated by PDGF-BB and is independent of FGF2, whereas the later phase of ERK activation is FGF2-dependent and required for entry into the S phase. Here we show that PDGF-BB-mediated VSMC growth is independent of FRS2 because PDGF-BB-mediated ERK activation and cell growth are unaffected by knockdown of FRS2 or increase in FRS2 expression. This is in contrast to the significant effect knockdown of FRS2 on PDGF-BB-mediated down-regulation of SMA and SM22α. There are some possible explanations for this apparent paradox. First, our knockdown of FRS2 is ∼70%, and the remaining FRS2 protein in PAC1 cells may be sufficient to mediate ERK activation and cell growth by PDGF-BB activation of the PDGFRβ-FGFR1-FRS2 complex but not down-regulation of VSMC marker gene expression. However, this is likely not to be the case in this study. We found that there was no increase in PDGF-BB-mediated cell proliferation in BVSMC transfected with FRS2 compared with PDGF-BB-stimulated nontransfected cells. The second possibility is that PDGF-BB may activate ERK via a secondary mechanism, perhaps through the adaptor protein Shc, which binds Grb2, and activates the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway. Shc signaling to ERK can be activated by PDGF-BB and FGF2, making this a plausible explanation for these differences (35.Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30911-30916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, the present study demonstrates that in VSMC, PDGF-BB through a multiprotein complex consisting of PDGFRβ, FGFR1, and FRS2 synergize to down-regulate VSMC marker gene expression and increase VSMC growth. Knockdown of FRS2 abrogated PDGF-BB-mediated down-regulation of SMA and SM22α but had little effect on PDGF-BB-mediated cell growth, suggesting that FRS2 has a unique function in the synergistic interaction between the PDGFRβ and FGFR1. Because PDGF and FGF2 signaling plays a role in vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis, this study indicates that FRS2 may be a new target for therapeutic intervention in vascular disease.

During these processes VSMC change from a contractile phenotype to a synthetic phenotype characterized by increased proliferation, migration, increased extracellular matrix production, and decreased expression of contractile proteins, including smooth muscle α-actin (SMA), SM22α, calponin, and myosin heavy chain. Several growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and thrombin have been implicated in the induction of the synthetic phenotype (3.Millette E.

These growth factors bind cell surface receptors and activate intracellular signaling pathways that result in changes in gene expression and cellular phenotype.

Experimental evidence using various in vitro and in vivo models points to a role for FGF-FGFR in the phenotypic modulation of VSMC. FGFs and FGFRs are expressed in VSMC and are up-regulated during vascular injury and in atherosclerotic plaque formation (4.Brogi E. Winkles J.A. Underwood R. Clinton S.K. Alberts G.F. Libby P. J.

Res. 1993; 73: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Balloon injury of rat arteries led to an increase in FGFR expression in VSMC. The up-regulation of FGF and FGFR suggests that they contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular disease. In support of this hypothesis, administration of anti-FGF2 antibodies and FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors results in decreased VSMC proliferation, migration, and attenuated neointimal thickening (7.Lindner V. Reidy M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3739-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). PDGF-BB binds to PDGFRβ and activates several intracellular signaling pathways including ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (8.Andrae J. Gallini R. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1276-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Studies have indicated that PDGF-BB induces the release of FGF2 and activation FGFR1, resulting in sustained ERK activation and proliferation of human VSMC (9.Millette E. Rauch B.H. Defawe O. Kenagy R.D. Daum G. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). When FGFR1 expression was inhibited by RNA interference, PDGF-BB induced transient but not sustained ERK activation. Binding of FGF2 to FGFR1 activates the ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways via the adaptor protein FRS2 (10.Thisse B. Thisse C. Dev.

Upon FGF2 binding, FGFR1 phosphorylates FRS2 on six tyrosine residues that function as docking sites for the SH2 domain-containing proteins Grb2 and SHP2 (12.Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Guy G.R.

FRS2 binds to FGFR1 via a Val-Thr dipeptide in the juxtamembrane region of FGFR1 (14.Burgar H.R. Burns H.D. Elsden J.L. Lalioti M.D. Heath J.K. J. Biol.

To determine the role of FRS2 in FGFR1-mediated VSMC phenotypic modulation and to determine the interaction of PDGFRβ with the FGFR1 signaling pathway, we developed a set of FGFR1 signaling pathway deficient mutants and stably expressed them in rat VSMC.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation leads to activation of a signaling cascade of Akt, mTOR, and S6 kinase, resulting in suppression VSMC marker gene expression (1.Owens G.K. Novartis Found.

Interestingly, in PAC1 cells expressing the mutant FGFR1 K562E, there was a small decrease in Akt phosphorylation that differed little from FGFR1 K562E: −FRS2-expressing PAC1 cells (36.Chen P.Y. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 382: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, SMA luciferase reporter assays indicate that a dominant negative Akt was unable to reverse the down-regulation of smooth muscle marker gene expression in FGFR1 K562E PAC1 cells. Together, these data indicate that the major pathway mediating down-regulation of VSMC marker gene expression in FGFR1 K562E expressing PAC1 cells is via the ERK pathway. The ERK pathway also leads S6 kinase activation independent of mTOR (2.Rzucidlo E.M. Martin K.A. Powell R.J. J. Vasc. Surg. 2007; 45 (Suppl.

Treatment of VSMC with either FGF2 or PDGF-BB results in down-regulation of SMA and increased VSMC proliferation. In addition, when added together, FGF2 and PDGF-BB had a synergistic effect on both processes. Furthermore, PDGF-BB stimulation of BVSMC resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1 and FRS2 to the same extent as that of FGF2. Together, these data suggest cross-talk between these two pathways at the level of receptor-receptor interactions. Indeed, FGFR1 and PDGFRβ co-immunoprecipitate, and PDGFRβ is able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of a FGFR1 kinase-deficient mutant. This tyrosine phosphorylation was neither inhibited by DN-Src nor enhanced by a CA-Src, suggesting that the transactivation of FGFR1 by PDGFRβ is likely direct.

FRS2 also mediates the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through the formation of a FRS2-Gab1-PI3 kinase complex (12.Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Guy G.R. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6074-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation leads to activation of a signaling cascade of Akt, mTOR, and S6 kinase, resulting in suppression VSMC marker gene expression (1.Owens G.K. Novartis Found. Symp. 2007; 283: 174-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Rzucidlo E.M. Martin K.A. Powell R.J. J. Vasc. Surg. 2007; 45 (Suppl.

J. Vasc. Surg. 2007; 45 (Suppl. A): 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in PAC1 cells expressing the mutant FGFR1 K562E, there was a small decrease in Akt phosphorylation that differed little from FGFR1 K562E: −FRS2-expressing PAC1 cells (36.Chen P.Y. Friesel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 382: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, SMA luciferase reporter assays indicate that a dominant negative Akt was unable to reverse the down-regulation of smooth muscle marker gene expression in FGFR1 K562E PAC1 cells. Together, these data indicate that the major pathway mediating down-regulation of VSMC marker gene expression in FGFR1 K562E expressing PAC1 cells is via the ERK pathway. The ERK pathway also leads S6 kinase activation independent of mTOR (2.Rzucidlo E.M. Martin K.A. Powell R.J. J. Vasc. Surg. 2007; 45 (Suppl. A): 25-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), likely represents an additional pathway by which smooth muscle marker genes are down-regulated, and will require additional study. Once we established that FGFR1 signaling via FRS2 results in down-regulation of smooth muscle marker gene expression, we queried whether FGFR1 and PDGFRβ signaling pathways act synergistically to down-regulate VSMC marker gene expression. Treatment of VSMC with either FGF2 or PDGF-BB results in down-regulation of SMA and increased VSMC proliferation. In addition, when added together, FGF2 and PDGF-BB had a synergistic effect on both processes. Furthermore, PDGF-BB stimulation of BVSMC resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1 and FRS2 to the same extent as that of FGF2. Together, these data suggest cross-talk between these two pathways at the level of receptor-receptor interactions. Indeed, FGFR1 and PDGFRβ co-immunoprecipitate, and PDGFRβ is able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of a FGFR1 kinase-deficient mutant. This tyrosine phosphorylation was neither inhibited by DN-Src nor enhanced by a CA-Src, suggesting that the transactivation of FGFR1 by PDGFRβ is likely direct. This is in contrast to the transactivation of the PDGFRβ in VSMC by G-protein-coupled receptors, which is Src-dependent (29.Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1050-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We next questioned whether FRS2 was an important component of FGFR1-PDGFRβ cross-talk. In 293T cells PDGFRβ D850N stimulated ERK phosphorylation and was significantly enhanced by the presence FRS2. The presence of FRS2 in PDGFRβ immunoprecipitates could be completely abrogated by co-transfection with a dominant negative FGFR1. Furthermore, in L6 myoblasts that are devoid of detectable FGFR but express PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, GST-FRS2αPTB did not pull down either PDGFR; however, in 293T cells expressing PDGFRβ the GST-FRS2αPTB efficiently pulled down a complex composed of FGFR1 and PDGFRβ, indicating that the association of PDGFRβ with FRS2 is indirect, through association with FGFR1. These data suggest a unique mechanism whereby FRS2 and FGFR1 contribute to the signaling output of PDGF-BB in the down-regulation of VSMC marker gene expression. Because PDGF-BB and FGF2 down-regulate smooth muscle marker gene expression in a synergistic manner and because FGFR1, PDGFRβ, and FRS2 form a multiprotein complex, we performed shRNA mediated knockdown of FRS2 to determine its contribution to PDGF-BB-mediated down-regulation of SMA and SM22α. We chose to target FRS2 for knockdown because it will likely abrogate signaling through FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 and eliminate the need to knockdown all FGFRs expressed in VSMC. Stable knockdown of FRS2 in two independent clones of PAC1 cells abrogated PDGF-BB-mediated down-regulation of SMA and SM22α. These data suggest that FGFR1 and FRS2 are major components of PDGF-BB-mediated signaling in the down-regulation of SMA and SM22α. Although we cannot rule out the direct activation of the Akt-mTOR-S6 kinase pathway by PDGFRβ in PAC1 VSMC, our data suggest that FRS2 via FGFR1 is a major regulator of VSMC phenotype and that ERK activation is a component of this regulation. VSMC proliferation is mediated in part via PDGF-BB-mediated activation of FGFR1 via the release of FGF2 (9.Millette E. Rauch B.H. Defawe O. Kenagy R.D. Daum G. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Sustained ERK activation is crucial to VSMC proliferation, and the early phase of ERK activation is mediated by PDGF-BB and is independent of FGF2, whereas the later phase of ERK activation is FGF2-dependent and required for entry into the S phase. Here we show that PDGF-BB-mediated VSMC growth is independent of FRS2 because PDGF-BB-mediated ERK activation and cell growth are unaffected by knockdown of FRS2 or increase in FRS2 expression. This is in contrast to the significant effect knockdown of FRS2 on PDGF-BB-mediated down-regulation of SMA and SM22α. There are some possible explanations for this apparent paradox. First, our knockdown of FRS2 is ∼70%, and the remaining FRS2 protein in PAC1 cells may be sufficient to mediate ERK activation and cell growth by PDGF-BB activation of the PDGFRβ-FGFR1-FRS2 complex but not down-regulation of VSMC marker gene expression. However, this is likely not to be the case in this study. We found that there was no increase in PDGF-BB-mediated cell proliferation in BVSMC transfected with FRS2 compared with PDGF-BB-stimulated nontransfected cells. The second possibility is that PDGF-BB may activate ERK via a secondary mechanism, perhaps through the adaptor protein Shc, which binds Grb2, and activates the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway. Shc signaling to ERK can be activated by PDGF-BB and FGF2, making this a plausible explanation for these differences (35.Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30911-30916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the present study demonstrates that in VSMC, PDGF-BB through a multiprotein complex consisting of PDGFRβ, FGFR1, and FRS2 synergize to down-regulate VSMC marker gene expression and increase VSMC growth. Knockdown of FRS2 abrogated PDGF-BB-mediated down-regulation of SMA and SM22α but had little effect on PDGF-BB-mediated cell growth, suggesting that FRS2 has a unique function in the synergistic interaction between the PDGFRβ and FGFR1. Because PDGF and FGF2 signaling plays a role in vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis, this study indicates that FRS2 may be a new target for therapeutic intervention in vascular disease.

On the other hand, the ratio between thymosin beta(4) and thymosin beta(10) exhibits a constant value of about 4 along all the range of PMA (190-550 days of PMA) examined. In order to investigate thymosin beta(4) origin and to better establish the trend of its production as a function of gestational age (GA), immunohistochemical analysis of major and minor salivary glands of different pre-term fetuses were carried out, starting from 84 days (12 weeks) of gestational age. Reactive granules were seen in all glands with a maximum of expression around 140-150 days of GA, even though with high inter- and intra-individual variability. In infants and adults reactive granules in acinar cells were not observed, but just a diffuse cytoplasmatic staining in ductal cells.This study outlines for the first time that salivary glands during foetal life express and secrete peptides such as beta-thymosins probably involved in the development of the oral cavity and its annexes. The secretion increases from about 12 weeks till to about 21 weeks of GA, subsequently it decreases, almost disappearing in the period of expected date of delivery, when the gland switches towards the secretion of adult specific salivary peptides. The switch observed may be an example of further secretion switches involving other exocrine and endocrine glands during foetal development."
https://openalex.org/W2061000461,"The clinical efficacy of conditionally replicative oncolytic adenoviruses (CRAd) is still limited by the inefficient infection of the tumor mass. Since tumor growth is essentially the result of a continuous cross-talk between malignant and tumor-associated stromal cells, targeting both cell compartments may profoundly influence viral efficacy. Therefore, we developed SPARC promoter-based CRAds since the SPARC gene is expressed both in malignant cells and in tumor-associated stromal cells. These CRAds, expressing or not the Herpes Simplex thymidine kinase gene (Ad-F512 and Ad(I)-F512-TK, respectively) exerted a lytic effect on a panel of human melanoma cells expressing SPARC; but they were completely attenuated in normal cells of different origins, including fresh melanocytes, regardless of whether cells expressed or not SPARC. Interestingly, both CRAds displayed cytotoxic activity on SPARC positive-transformed human microendothelial HMEC-1 cells and WI-38 fetal fibroblasts. Both CRAds were therapeutically effective on SPARC positive-human melanoma tumors growing in nude mice but exhibited restricted efficacy in the presence of co-administered HMEC-1 or WI-38 cells. Conversely, co-administration of HMEC-1 cells enhanced the oncolytic efficacy of Ad(I)-F512-TK on SPARC-negative MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells in vivo. Moreover, conditioned media produced by stromal cells pre-infected with the CRAds enhanced the in vitro viral oncolytic activity on pancreatic cancer cells, but not on melanoma cells. The whole data indicate that stromal cells might play an important role on the outcome of the oncolytic efficacy of conditionally replicative adenoviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2021155149,"This study demonstrates deregulation of polycomb activity by the synovial sarcoma-associated SYT-SSX2 oncogene, also known as SS18-SSX2. Synovial sarcoma is a soft tissue cancer associated with a recurrent t(X:18) translocation event that generates one of two fusion proteins, SYT-SSX1 or SYT-SSX2. The role of the translocation products in this disease is poorly understood. We present evidence that the SYT-SSX2 fusion protein interacts with the polycomb repressive complex and modulates its gene silencing activity. SYT-SSX2 causes destabilization of the polycomb subunit Bmi1, resulting in impairment of polycomb-associated histone H2A ubiquitination and reactivation of polycomb target genes. Silencing by polycomb complexes plays a vital role in numerous physiological processes. In recent years, numerous reports have implicated gain of polycomb silencing function in several cancers. This study provides evidence that, in the appropriate context, expression of the SYT-SSX2 oncogene leads to loss of polycomb function. It challenges the notion that cancer is solely associated with an increase in polycomb function and suggests that any imbalance in polycomb activity could drive the cell toward oncogenesis. These findings provide a mechanism by which the SYT-SSX2 chimera may contribute to synovial sarcoma pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2053103759,"Wnt/beta-catenin signaling controls cell growth during development, and its misregulation in adults can cause human diseases. LRP6, the essential co-receptor for the Wnt pathway, consists of four beta-propeller domains flanked by epidermal growth factor repeats in its extracellular region. To understand the maturation and ligand-binding properties of individual BP domains, we generated soluble receptor consisting of individual BPs, as well as combinations of these domains. We show that BP1, BP2, and BP4 each can be folded and secreted, and their secretion was enhanced by co-expression of Mesd, a molecular chaperone essential for LRP6 folding and maturation. BP3 is not secreted when expressed on its own or in combination with BP2 or BP1 and 2 (BP12); however, folding and secretion of BP3 is vastly enhanced when expressed together with BP4. Similar cooperative folding and maturation was observed between BP1 and BP2. These results suggest that BP1 forms a functional folding unit with BP2, whereas BP3 folds together with BP4. Using these BP constructs, we also found that BP12 and BP34 constitute independent ligand-binding domains capable of binding Wnt3a, Dkk1, and Mesd. The ability of Mesd to block the binding of both Wnt3a and Dkk1 to LRP6 enables this specialized chaperone to function as a Wnt signaling modulator. Together, our studies reveal unique properties of the LRP6 BP domains and provide novel tools to understand LRP6 function in ligand binding and Wnt signaling. Our results also support the development of soluble LRP6 receptors and Mesd as potential therapeutic molecules that target Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2066906261,"Creatine kinase catalyzes the reversible transfer of the N-phosphoryl group from phosphocreatine to ADP to generate ATP and plays a key role in highly energy-demanding processes such as muscle contraction and flagellar motility; however, its role in signal transduction (which frequently involves ATP-consuming phosphorylation) and consequent cell-fate decisions remains largely unknown. Here we report that creatine kinase B was significantly up-regulated during the differentiation of double-positive thymocytes into single-positive thymocytes. Ectopic expression of creatine kinase B led to increased ATP level and enhanced phosphorylation of the TCR signaling proteins. Consequentially, transgenic expression of creatine kinase B promoted the expression of Nur77 and Bim proteins and the cell death of TCR signaled thymocyte. In addition, the activation, proliferation and cytokine secretion of T cells were also enhanced by the expression of creatine kinase B transgene. In contrast, treatment of T cells with specific creatine kinase inhibitor or creatine kinase B shRNA resulted in severely impaired T cell activation. Taken together, our results indicate that creatine kinase B plays an unexpected role in modulating TCR-mediated signaling and critically regulates thymocyte selection and T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2095424147,"The viscoelastic properties of passive eye muscles are prime determinants of the deficits observed following eye muscle paralysis, the root cause of several types of strabismus. Our limited knowledge about such properties is hindering the ability of eye plant models to assist in formulating a patient's diagnosis and prognosis. To investigate these properties we conducted an extensive in vivo study of the mechanics of passive eye muscles in deeply anesthetized and paralyzed monkeys. We describe here the static length-tension relationship and the transient forces elicited by small step-like elongations. We found that the static force increases nonlinearly with length, as previously shown. As expected, an elongation step induces a fast rise in force, followed by a prolonged decay. The time course of the decay is however considerably more complex than previously thought, indicating the presence of several relaxation processes, with time constants ranging from 1 ms to at least 40 s. The mechanical properties of passive eye muscles are thus similar to those of many other biological passive tissues. Eye plant models, which for lack of data had to rely on (erroneous) assumptions, will have to be updated to incorporate these properties."
https://openalex.org/W2091360362,"We have previously demonstrated that both parasite genetic variability and host genetic background were important in determining the differential tissue distribution of the Col1.7G2 and JG T. cruzi monoclonal strains after artificial infections in mice. We observed that the JG strain was most prevalent in hearts of mouse lineages with the MHC haplotype H-2d (BALB/c and DBA2), while Col1.7G2 was predominant in hearts from C57BL/6 mice, which have the H-2b haplotype. To assess whether the MHC gene region indeed influenced tissue tropism of T. cruzi, we used the same two parasite strains to infect C57BL/6 (H-2b) and C57BLKS/J (H-2d) mice; the latter strain results from the introgression of DBA2 MHC region into the C57BL/6 background. We also performed ex vivo infections of cardiac explants from four congenic mice lineages with the H-2b and H-2d haplotypes arranged in two different genetic backgrounds: C57BLKS/J (H-2d) versus C57BL/6 (H-2b) and BALB/c (H-2d) versus BALB/B10-H2b (H-2b). In agreement with our former observations, Col1.7G2 was predominant in hearts from C57BL/6 mice (H-2b), but we observed a clear predominance of the JG strain in hearts from C57BLKS/J animals (H-2d). In the ex vivo experiments Col1.7G2 also prevailed in explants from H-2b animals while no predominance of any of the strains was observed in H-2d mice explants, regardless of the genetic background. These observations clearly demonstrate that the MHC region influences the differential tissue distribution pattern of infecting T. cruzi strains, which by its turn may be in a human infection the determinant for the clinical forms of the Chagas disease."
https://openalex.org/W1999846729,"Membrane proteins are essential in the exchange processes of cells. In spite of great breakthrough in soluble proteins studies, membrane proteins structures, functions and interactions are still a challenge because of the difficulties related to their hydrophobic properties. Most of the experiments are performed with detergent-solubilized membrane proteins. However widely used micellar systems are far from the biological two-dimensions membrane. The development of new biomimetic membrane systems is fundamental to tackle this issue. We present an original approach that combines the Fluorescence Recovery After fringe Pattern Photobleaching technique and the use of a versatile sponge phase that makes it possible to extract crucial informations about interactions between membrane proteins embedded in the bilayers of a sponge phase. The clear advantage lies in the ability to adjust at will the spacing between two adjacent bilayers. When the membranes are far apart, the only possible interactions occur laterally between proteins embedded within the same bilayer, whereas when membranes get closer to each other, interactions between proteins embedded in facing membranes may occur as well. After validating our approach on the streptavidin-biotinylated peptide complex, we study the interactions between two membrane proteins, MexA and OprM, from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa efflux pump. The mode of interaction, the size of the protein complex and its potential stoichiometry are determined. In particular, we demonstrate that: MexA is effectively embedded in the bilayer; MexA and OprM do not interact laterally but can form a complex if they are embedded in opposite bilayers; the population of bound proteins is at its maximum for bilayers separated by a distance of about 200 Å, which is the periplasmic thickness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We also show that the MexA-OprM association is enhanced when the position and orientation of the protein is restricted by the bilayers. We extract a stoichiometry for the complex that exhibits a strong pH dependance: from 2 to 6 MexA per OprM trimer when the pH decreases from 7.5 to 5.5. Our technique allows to study membrane protein associations in a membrane environment. It provides some challenging information about complexes such as geometry and stoichiometry."
https://openalex.org/W2054341799,"Neuronal voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels are involved in electrical signalling and in converting these signals into cytoplasmic calcium changes. One important function of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels is generating regenerative dendritic Ca(2+) spikes. However, the Ca(2+) dependent mechanisms used to create these spikes are only partially understood. To start investigating this mechanism, we set out to kinetically and pharmacologically identify the sub-types of somatic voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in pyramidal neurons from layer 5 of rat somatosensory cortex, using the nucleated configuration of the patch-clamp technique. The activation kinetics of the total Ba(2+) current revealed conductance activation only at medium and high voltages suggesting that T-type calcium channels were not present in the patches. Steady-state inactivation protocols in combination with pharmacology revealed the expression of R-type channels. Furthermore, pharmacological experiments identified 5 voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel sub-types - L-, N-, R- and P/Q-type. Finally, the activation of the Ca(2+) conductances was examined using physiologically derived voltage-clamp protocols including a calcium spike protocol and a mock back-propagating action potential (mBPAP) protocol. These experiments enable us to suggest the possible contribution of the five Ca(2+) channel sub-types to Ca(2+) current flow during activation under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1969635358,"The liver stage of Plasmodium's life cycle is the first, obligatory step in malaria infection. Decreasing the hepatic burden of Plasmodium infection decreases the severity of disease and constitutes a promising strategy for malaria prophylaxis. The efficacy of the gamma-secretase and signal peptide peptidase inhibitor LY411,575 in targeting Plasmodium liver stages was evaluated both in human hepatoma cell lines and in mouse primary hepatocytes. LY411,575 was found to prevent Plasmodium's normal development in the liver, with an IC(50) of approximately 80 nM, without affecting hepatocyte invasion by the parasite. In vivo results with a rodent model of malaria showed that LY411,575 decreases the parasite load in the liver and increases by 55% the resistance of mice to cerebral malaria, one of the most severe malaria-associated syndromes. Our data show that LY411,575 does not exert its effect via the Notch signaling pathway suggesting that it may interfere with Plasmodium development through an inhibition of the parasite's signal peptide peptidase. We therefore propose that selective signal peptide peptidase inhibitors could be potentially used for preventive treatment of malaria in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2029191573,"Background Though the Nuclear factor 1 family member NFIX has been strongly implicated in PDGFB-induced glioblastoma, its molecular mechanisms of action remain unknown. HSF1, a heat shock-related transcription factor is also a powerful modifier of carcinogenesis by several factors, including PDGFB. How HSF1 transcription is controlled has remained largely elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings By combining microarray expression profiling and a yeast-two-hybrid screen, we identified that NFIX and its interactions with CGGBP1 and HMGN1 regulate expression of HSF1. We found that CGGBP1 organizes a bifunctional transcriptional complex at small CGG repeats in the HSF1 promoter. Under chronic heat shock, NFIX uses CGGBP1 and HMGN1 to get recruited to this promoter and in turn affects their binding to DNA. Results show that the interactions of NFIX with CGGBP1 and HMGN1 in the soluble fraction are heat shock sensitive due to preferential localization of CGGBP1 to heterochromatin after heat shock. HSF1 in turn was found to bind to the NFIX promoter and repress its expression in a heat shock sensitive manner. Conclusions/Significance NFIX and HSF1 exert a mutual transcriptional repressive effect on each other which requires CGG repeat in HSF1 promoter and HSF1 binding site in NFIX promoter. We unravel a unique mechanism of heat shock sensitive DNA sequence-directed reciprocal transcriptional regulation between NFIX and HSF1. Our findings provide new insights into mechanisms of transcription regulation under stress."
https://openalex.org/W2089339463,"Misfolded proteins are generally recognised by cellular quality control machinery, which typically results in their ubiquitination and degradation. For soluble cytoplasmic proteins, degradation is mediated by the proteasome. Membrane proteins that fail to fold correctly are subject to ER associated degradation (ERAD), which involves their extraction from the membrane and subsequent proteasome-dependent destruction. Proteins with abnormal transmembrane domains can also be recognised in the Golgi or endosomal system and targeted for destruction in the vacuole/lysosome. It is much less clear what happens to membrane proteins that reach their destination, such as the cell surface, and then suffer damage.We have tested the ability of yeast cells to degrade membrane proteins to which temperature-sensitive cytoplasmic alleles of the Ura3 protein or of phage lambda repressor have been fused. In soluble form, these proteins are rapidly degraded upon temperature shift, in part due to the action of the Doa10 and San1 ubiquitin ligases and the proteasome. When tethered to the ER protein Use1, they are also degraded. However, when tethered to a plasma membrane protein such as Sso1 they escape degradation, either in the vacuole or by the proteasome.Membrane proteins with a misfolded cytoplasmic domain appear not to be efficiently recognised and degraded once they have escaped the ER, even though their defective domains are exposed to the cytoplasm and potentially to cytoplasmic quality controls. Membrane tethering may provide a way to reduce degradation of unstable proteins."

To date, the transcriptional and post-transcription regulation of FLIP has not been fully elucidated. NF-κB strongly up-regulates the expression of FLIPL and FLIPS (10Micheau O. Lens S. Gaide O.

Karin M. Cell. 2006; 124: 601-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), the TNFα-accelerated FLIPL turnover in mouse hepatocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts was mediated through JNK activation that occurs when NF-κB activation is suppressed. The JNK-mediated phosphorylation of E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch results in the ubiquitination and degradation of FLIPL. However, the role of TNFα in the post-transcriptional regulation of FLIP in the absence of NF-κB inhibition or the prolonged activation of JNK is not known. The dysregulation of macrophage function contributes to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (22Ma Y.

Our prior observations demonstrate that FLIP is critical for the protection of macrophages against death receptor-mediated apoptosis in rheumatoid arthritis (8Perlman H. Pagliari L.J. Liu H. Koch A.E. Haines III, G.K. Pope R.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Perlman H. Pagliari L.J. Georganas C. Mano T. Walsh K. Pope R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar); however, knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate FLIP in macrophages is incomplete. While characterizing the expression of FLIP in macrophages, in contrast to expectations, we noticed that activation with TNFα or LPS actually reduced the protein levels of FLIPL, but not FLIPS, at 1 and 2 h, even though the mRNA of both isoforms was increased. The activation-induced reduction of FLIPL resulted in the increased activation of caspase 8, which promoted the activation of NF-κB and the expression of FLIP mRNA. Our observations also demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt-1 (Akt) pathway mediates the activation-induced reduction of FLIPL by the phosphorylation of FLIPL at serine 273. These observations identify a novel pathway regulating the decision for life and death of the macrophage following activation, and they identify the regulation of FLIPL as a potential therapeutic target. Cell Culture—Human macrophages were differentiated from monocytes isolated from the buffy coats (Lifesource, Glenview, IL) from healthy donors. Mononuclear cells were obtained by histopaque gradient centrifugation and monocytes by counter-current centrifugal elutriation (JE-6B; Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA) in the presence of 10 μg/ml polymyxin B sulfate (Sigma), as previously describe RPMI medium without serum and were differentiated in vitro for 7 days in RPMI containing 20% heat-inactivated FBS, 1 μg/ml polymyxin B sulfate, 0.35 mg/ml l-glutamine, 120 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (20% FBS/RPMI) (27Perlman H.

Adenovirus Infection of Primary Macrophages—A control adenoviral empty vector (CMV-blank) and adenoviral vectors expressing a FLIPL, a super-repressor IκBα, a constitutively activated myristilated AKT mutant (Myr-AKT), and a dominant negative form of AKT (DN-AKT) were employed. Macrophages were infected with adenoviral vectors in RPMI medium without serum for 2 h. After infection, 20% FBS/RPMI was added, and the cells were incubated overnight. The macrophages were then washed twice with PBS and incubated in 20% FBS/RPMI for an additional 24 h and then employed as described under “Results.” Caspase 8-like Activity—Macrophages were treated as indicated and harvested. Cell lysates were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioVision Research Products, Palo Alto, CA). Cell lysates containing 180 μg of protein were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with the caspase 8 (Ac-IETD-AFC) synthetic fluorogenic substrate. The samples were read on a fluorometer at 400-nm excitation and 505-nm emission. Apoptosis—Macrophages were harvested, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). The apoptotic profile was determined by flow cytometry utilizing a Beckman-Coulter EpicsXL flow cytometer and system 2 software, as described (27Perlman H. Pagliari L.J. Georganas C. Mano T. Walsh K.

The hypodiploid DNA peak (<2 n DNA) immediately adjacent to the G0/G1 peak (2 n DNA) represented apoptotic cells and was quantified by histogram analyses. Objects with minimal light scatter representing debris were excluded. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from macrophages using the TRIzol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription with oligo(dT) primer was performed employing the reverse transcription system kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real time PCR was carried out employing TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems). The sequences for the FLIP forward and reverse primers were as follows: forward primer for both FLIPL and FLIPS 5′-CAAGCAGTCTGTTCAAGGA, reverse primer of FLIPL 5′-GCCAAGCTGTTCCTTAAGA, reverse primer of FLIPS 5′-ATGGGCATAGGGTGTTATC. The probe, 5′-TGTTCTCCAAGCAGCAATCCA, was labeled with carboxyfluorescein-aminohexyl amidite. The control human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers and VIC-labeled probe were obtained from Applied Biosystems and employed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR was performed with a ABI PRISM™ 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 60 ng of complementary DNA, 800 nm each of the forward and reverse primers, and 250 nm of the probes. The amplification program was: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Quantitative values were derived from the threshold cycle number (Ct) (11Bai S. Liu H. Chen K.H. Eksarko P. Perlman H. Moore T.L. Pope R.M.

A relative gene expression was determined by assigning the control a relative value of 1.0, with all other values relative to the control. siRNA Transfection—The forced reduction of caspase 8, Akt-1, and Itch in macrophages was achieved employing the SMARTpools of caspase 8, Akt-1, or Itch siRNA, (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). A nonspecific siRNA was employed as the control. Macrophages in 6-well plates were transfected with siRNAs by Lipofectamine methods following vender's protocol, as previously described (32Liu H.

After 4 h, FBS was added to bring the culture medium to 20% FBS, and the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (27Perlman H. Pagliari L.J. Georganas C. Mano T. Walsh K. Pope R.M. J. Exp.

Briefly, whole cell extracts were prepared from macrophages that were treated as indicated under “Results.” The proteins (60 μg) were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) by semidry electroblotter (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then blocked in 5% nonfat milk PBS/0.2% Tween 20 (PBST) and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-human FLIP (Alexis Biochem, Carlsbad, CA), anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt Ser473, anti-caspase 8 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-Itch, anti-phosphoserine (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), anti-IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-HA-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Roche Applied Science), and anti-β-actin (Sigma). The membranes were washed in PBST and incubated with either donkey anti-rat, anti-rabbit, or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:3300 dilution; Amersham Biosciences). The specific proteins were detected by Enhanced Chemiluminescent detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Co-immunoprecipitation Method— To characterize the FLIPL serine phosphorylation status, FLIPL was pulled down by immunoprecipitation and detected by anti-phosphoserine antibody. Briefly, whole cell extracts containing 600 μg of protein were precleared with 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. The precleared lysates were collected and incubated with FLIP antibody (5 μg) for 1 h, followed by the addition of 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads, which were incubated with rocking overnight at 4 °C. After being washed four times, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis for the serine phosphorylation of FLIPL employing an anti-phosphoserine specific antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA). To detect the interaction between FLIPL and Akt, 600 μg of precleared cell lysates from macrophages that were co-infected with adenoviral vectors expressing FLIPL and HA-Myr-Akt were incubated with anti-FLIP or anti-HA antibodies for 1 h and then further incubated overnight after adding 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads. The rat IgG and rabbit IgG were employed as negative controls for FLIP and HA antibodies. After washing, the samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis and probed with FLIP or anti-HA antibodies. In Vivo [32P]Orthophosphate Cell Labeling for FLIP Phosphorylation—Macrophages in 6-well plates were infected with an adenoviral vector expressing Myr-Akt or the CMV control vector. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with [32P]orthophosphate (0.42 mCi/ml) in minimum Eagle's medium without phosphate for 2 h. FLIP was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLIP antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then dried, and FLIPL phosphorylation status was detected by autoradiography. Site-directed Mutagenesis of FLIPL and Development of Cell Lines—Serine residue 273 on FLIPL, a putative Akt phosphorylation site, was point mutated to alanine by a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the supplier's protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In brief, we used retroviral pLXIN-FLIPL expression vector as template and used the following oligonucleotides to make point mutation serine 273 to alanine (mutated codon indicated as underlined): 5′-CGA GAC ACC TTC ACT GCC CTG GGC TAT GAA GTC-3′ (forward), 5′-GAC TTC ATA GCC CAG GGC AGT GAA GGT GTC TCG-3′ (reverse). The sequences of wild type and mutant form of FLIPL cDNA in pLXIN vectors were verified to be correct by DNA sequencing. The pLXIN-FLIPL wild type or mutant plasmids were transfected into packaging cell line PT67, and recombinant retroviral RNAs were packaged into infectious, replication-incompetent particles. Culture media containing the viral particles were collected and used to infect RAW264.7 cells. Stably expressing wild type and mutant FLIPL expressing cell lines were selected in medium containing 600 μg/ml geneticin (G418). Statistical Analysis—The experimental data are presented as the means ± S.E. The statistical differences between groups were determined by t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. FLIPL Is Regulated Differently by TNFα at the mRNA and Protein Levels—Studies were performed to determine the effect of activation through the TNF receptor pathway on the expression of FLIP employing normal in vitro differentiated macrophages. Incubation of macrophages with TNFα resulted in the induction of mRNA for both FLIPL and FLIPS (Fig. 1A), which were significantly (p < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively) increased by 2 h (Fig. 1, A and C) and diminished between 12 and 24 h (Fig. 1A). The induction of FLIP at the protein level was very different. By immunoblot analysis TNFα-induced FLIPS was significantly increased (p < 0.01) at 2 h, peaked at 8 h, and returned to basal levels by 24 h (Fig. 1B). In contrast, there was a significant (p < 0.01) reduction of FLIPL at 2 h (Fig. 1D), although FLIPL protein was increased at 8 and 12 h (Fig. 1B). To determine whether these observations were unique to TNFα, macrophages were incubated with LPS to activate the TLR4 pathway. The effects on FLIPL and FLIPS were the same as observed with TNFα (Fig. 1, A–D). These observations suggest that a regulatory mechanism at protein level is involved in reducing the intracellular level of FLIPL following activation with TNFα or LPS and that these effects were reversed by 8 h. NF-κB activation is one of the pathways known to contribute to the expression of FLIP (10Micheau O. Lens S. Gaide O. Alevizopoulos K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5299-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 11Bai S. Liu H. Chen K.H. Eksarko P. Perlman H. Moore T.L. Pope R.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 3844-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, macrophages were infected with an adenoviral vector expressing a super repressor IκBα (Ad-IκBα) to characterize the effects of the inhibition of NF-κB activation on the expression of FLIP. The ectopic expression IκBα dramatically suppressed the TNFα-induced (Fig. 1, E and F) and LPS-induced (data not shown) FLIPL and FLIPS at both the mRNA (Fig. 1E) and protein (Fig. 1F) levels. Compared with its basal level in the presence of IκBα alone, at 2 h FLIPL protein was reduced by TNFα when IκBα was expressed, suggesting that the activation induced reduction of FLIPL also occurred when NF-κB activation was suppressed. Of note, the suppression of NF-κB activation in macrophages by infection with the Ad-IκBα for 24 h did not suppress the constitutive expression of FLIPL and FLIPS mRNA (Fig. 1E) or the expression of FLIPL protein (Fig. 1F). These observations demonstrate that TNFα- and LPS-induced FLIP in macrophages is predominantly regulated transcriptionally and that the basal levels FLIPL and FLIPS may be regulated by pathways other than NF-κB. PI3K Is Involved in TNFα-mediated Degradation of FLIPL— Besides activating the NF-κB pathway, TNFα and LPS also activate the MAPK, PI3K/Akt-1, and protein kinase C signaling pathways (34Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar, 35O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar). Because additional studies demonstrated that the reduction of FLIPL was more pronounced at 1 h (40–60%) compared with 2 h (30–40%, p < 0.02), the 1-h time point was employed to define the mechanism for the reduction of FLIPL. The reduction of FLIPL induced by TNFα at 1 h was not observed when macrophages were co-incubated with the PI3K inhibitors LY 294002 (20 μm) or wortmannin (200 nm) (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the TNFα-induced reduction of FLIPL was still present when the macrophages were co-incubated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm) or the protein kinase C inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide III (20 μm) or bisindolylmaleimide VIII (10 μm) (data not shown). The experiments were also performed to determine whether the reduction of FLIPL may be due to caspase activation, because caspase 8 may form heterodimers with FLIPL (55kDa), processing FLIPL into p43, p22, and p12 fragments (36Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 37Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Treatment with TNFα alone resulted in very little p43 FLIP (data not shown). Additionally, incubation of macrophages with caspase 8 inhibitor IETD prior to the addition of TNFα failed to prevent the reduction of FLIPL (Fig. 2, A and B). Further, the forced reduction of caspase 8 by a specific siRNA failed to protect FLIPL from TNFα-induced reduction (Fig. 2, C and D). These observations suggest that the TNFα-induced reduction of FLIPL was mediated through the PI3K pathway and that activated caspase 8 was not responsible. Akt Mediates the TNFα-induced Reduction of FLIPL—Because Akt-1 (Akt) is downstream of PI3K, the experiments were performed to determine the role of Akt in the TNFα-induced reduction of FLIPL. Employing macrophages, TNFα induced the activation of Akt, determined with an antibody specific for phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt, and LY 294002 suppressed this activation (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained for LPS (data not shown). To confirm the role of Akt, macrophages were infected with an adenoviral vector expressing a dominant negative form of Akt (Ad-DN-Akt), previously demonstrated to suppress Akt activity (29Liu H. Perlman H. Pagliari L.J. Pope R.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 38Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), or a CMV control vector (Ad-CMV) prior to the addition of TNFα. Following infection with the Ad-CMV vector, incubation with TNFα resulted in a 54% reduction (p < 0.01) of FLIPL at 1 h, whereas no reduction of FLIPL was noted in cells expressing the DN-Akt (Fig. 3, B and C). To more specifically examine the role of Akt, siRNA was employed to transfect macrophages. Overall there was a minor increase of FLIPL in macrophages transfected with the Akt-specific siRNA, compared with the nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 3, D and E). Consistent with the observations obtained employing the chemical inhibitors and the DN Akt, the forced reduction of Akt (Fig. 3D) prevented the reduction of FLIPL induced by incubation with TNFα (Fig. 3E). These observations demonstrate that Akt is necessary for the TNFα-induced suppression of FLIPL. Akt Promotes TNFα-induced Caspase 8 and NF-κB Activation and Increased FLIP mRNA—Experiments were performed to determine the relevance of the Akt-mediated reduction of FLIPL, by examination of caspase 8 activation. When macrophages were transfected with nonspecific siRNA, TNFα induced caspase 8-like activity at 1 h, which returned to base line by 4 h (Fig. 4A). No apoptosis, defined by DNA fragmentation, was observed at 16 h (data not shown). In contrast, the forced reduction of Akt prevented the induction of caspase 8-like activity (Fig. 4A). To determine the biological relevance of the caspase 8-like activity, NF-κB activation was measured by examining IκBα by immunoblot analysis. TNFα resulted in the reduction of IκBα at 15 and 30 min, which returned to base line by 60 min (Fig. 4, B and C). The suppression of caspase 8-like activity by IETD (Fig. 4B) or the forced reduction of caspase 8 by siRNA (Fig. 4C) resulted in the attenuation of NF-κB activation. Because NF-κB activation is responsible for the TNFα-mediated induction of FLIP, the effect of caspase inhibition on the expression of FLIP mRNA was examined. Both IETD and caspase 8 siRNA resulted in the significant (p < 0.05-0.01) reduction of both FLIPL and FLIPS mRNA at 1 and 2 h (Fig. 4, D and E). Therefore, the TNFα-induced reduction of FLIPL promotes NF-κB activation, which in turn enhances the expression of FLIPL and FLIPS mRNA. The Forced Reduction of Akt Suppresses TNFα-induced Caspase 8 Activation and Apoptosis When NF-κB Is Suppressed— Next the role of Akt in regulation FLIPL and caspase"
https://openalex.org/W1993666038,"Background The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of extra-enteric findings in a large cohort of patients undergoing magnetic resonance enterography (MR-E) and to classify the clinical significance of these findings. Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed 1154 MR-E performed in 1006 patients referred to our radiological department between 1999–2005. The reasons for referral were suspected or proven inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (n = 710), further diagnostic work-up for small bowel disease because of non-specific abdominal symptoms (SBD; n = 182) or suspected small bowel malignancies (SBM; n = 114). All extra-enteric findings were reviewed by a radiologist and a gastroenterologist and were classified as having high, moderate, or low significance for further diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Results The average age of all patients was 40±16 (Mean±SD) years (y) (IBD 35±13 y; SBD 49±16 y; SBM 57±15 y). A total of 1113 extra-enteric findings were detected in 600 of 1006 patients (59.6%). Of these findings 180 (16.2%) were judged as having a high, 212 (19.0%) a moderate and 721 (64.8%) a low significance. On a per group basis in patients with IBD 12.0% of the findings were of major clinical significance compared to 13.7% and 33.3% in patients with SBD and SBM, respectively. The most common major findings were abscesses (69.9%) in the IBD group and extraintestinal tumors, metastases or masses in the SBD and SBM groups (41.9% and 74.2%, respectively). Conclusions MR-E reveals a substantial number of extra-enteric findings, supporting the role of a cross-sectional imaging method for the evaluation of the small bowel."
https://openalex.org/W2138723099,"The trails formed by many ant species between nest and food source are two-way roads on which outgoing and returning workers meet and touch each other all along. The way to get back home, after grasping a food load, is to take the same route on which they have arrived from the nest. In many species such trails are chemically marked by pheromones providing orientation cues for the ants to find their way. Other species rely on their vision and use landmarks as cues. We have developed a method to stop foraging ants from shuttling on two-way trails. The only way to forage is to take two separate roads, as they cannot go back on their steps after arriving at the food or at the nest. The condition qualifies as a problem because all their orientation cues -- chemical, visual or any other -- are disrupted, as all of them cannot but lead the ants back to the route on which they arrived. We have found that workers of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa can solve the problem. They could not only find the alternative way, but also used the unidirectional traffic system to forage effectively. We suggest that their ability is an evolutionary consequence of the need to deal with environmental irregularities that cannot be negotiated by means of excessively stereotyped behavior, and that it is but an example of a widespread phenomenon. We also suggest that our method can be adapted to other species, invertebrate and vertebrate, in the study of orientation, memory, perception, learning and communication."
