https://openalex.org/W2008933729,"DNA CpG methylation can cooperate with histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) methylation in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing. Trimethylation of H3-K9 by the recently identified euchromatic histone methyltransferase SETDB1/ESET may be responsible for transcriptional repression of certain promoters. Here, we show that SETDB1 associates with endogenous DNA methyltransferase activity. SETDB1 interacts with the <i>de novo</i> DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B but not with the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1. The interaction of SETDB1 with DNMT3A was further characterized and confirmed by <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> interaction studies. A direct interaction of the two proteins occurs through the N terminus of SETDB1 and the plant homeodomain of DNMT3A. Co-expression of SETDB1 and DNMT3A was essential for repression of reporter gene expression in a Gal4-based tethering assay and resulted in their recruitment to the artificial promoter. We further demonstrate that the CpG-methylated promoters of the endogenous <i>p53BP2</i> gene in HeLa cells and the <i>RASSF1A</i> gene in MDA-MB-231 cells are simultaneously occupied by both SETDB1 and DNMT3A proteins, which provides evidence for SETDB1 being at least partly responsible for H3-K9 trimethylation at the promoter of <i>RASSF1A</i>, a gene frequently silenced in human cancers. In summary, our data demonstrate the direct physical interaction and functional connection between the H3-K9 trimethylase SETDB1 and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and thus contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of the self-reinforcing heterochromatin machinery operating at silenced promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2120807382,"Nitric oxide ((*)NO)-derived reactive species nitrate unsaturated fatty acids, yielding nitroalkene derivatives, including the clinically abundant nitrated oleic and linoleic acids. The olefinic nitro group renders these derivatives electrophilic at the carbon beta to the nitro group, thus competent for Michael addition reactions with cysteine and histidine. By using chromatographic and mass spectrometric approaches, we characterized this reactivity by using in vitro reaction systems, and we demonstrated that nitroalkene-protein and GSH adducts are present in vivo under basal conditions in healthy human red cells. Nitro-linoleic acid (9-, 10-, 12-, and 13-nitro-9,12-octadecadienoic acids) (m/z 324.2) and nitro-oleic acid (9- and 10-nitro-9-octadecaenoic acids) (m/z 326.2) reacted with GSH (m/z 306.1), yielding adducts with m/z of 631.3 and 633.3, respectively. At physiological concentrations, nitroalkenes inhibited glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which contains a critical catalytic Cys (Cys-149). GAPDH inhibition displayed an IC(50) of approximately 3 microM for both nitroalkenes, an IC(50) equivalent to the potent thiol oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) and an IC(50) 30-fold less than H(2)O(2), indicating that nitroalkenes are potent thiol-reactive species. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed covalent adducts between fatty acid nitroalkene derivatives and GAPDH, including at the catalytic Cys-149. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of human red cells confirmed that nitroalkenes readily undergo covalent, thiol-reversible post-translational modification of nucleophilic amino acids in GSH and GAPDH in vivo. The adduction of GAPDH and GSH by nitroalkenes significantly increased the hydrophobicity of these molecules, both inducing translocation to membranes and suggesting why these abundant derivatives had not been detected previously via traditional high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. The occurrence of these electrophilic nitroalkylation reactions in vivo indicates that this reversible post-translational protein modification represents a new pathway for redox regulation of enzyme function, cell signaling, and protein trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2073453659,"Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) plays a pivotal role in inflammation, immunity, stress responses, and protection from apoptosis. Canonical activation of NF-κB is dependent on the phosphorylation of the inhibitory subunit IκBα that is mediated by a multimeric, high molecular weight complex, called IκB kinase (IKK) complex. This is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, NEMO/IKKγ. The latter protein is essential for the activation of IKKs and NF-κB, but its mechanism of action is not well understood. Here we identified ABIN-1 (A20 binding inhibitor of NF-κB) as a NEMO/IKKγ-interacting protein. ABIN-1 has been previously identified as an A20-binding protein and it has been proposed to mediate the NF-κB inhibiting effects of A20. We find that both ABIN-1 and A20 inhibit NF-κB at the level of the IKK complex and that A20 inhibits activation of NF-κB by de-ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ. Importantly, small interfering RNA targeting ABIN-1 abrogates A20-dependent de-ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ and RNA interference of A20 impairs the ability of ABIN-1 to inhibit NF-κB activation. Altogether our data indicate that ABIN-1 physically links A20 to NEMO/IKKγ and facilitates A20-mediated de-ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ, thus resulting in inhibition of NF-κB.

NF-κB is a ubiquitously expressed family of transcription factors that controls the expression of numerous genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). NF-κB also plays an important role during cellular stress responses, due to its anti-apoptotic and proliferation-promoting functions (2Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). Aberrant activation of NF-κB is a major hallmark of several inflammatory diseases such as arthritis (3Walsh N.C. Crotti T.N. Goldring S.R. Gravallese E.M. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 208: 228-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 4Orange J.S. Levy O. Geha R.S. Immunol.

In resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by members of the inhibitory family of IκB proteins (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Various stimuli including pathogens, pathogen-related factors, and cytokines lead to phosphorylation of the inhibitory subunit IκBα on specific serine residues (Ser32 and Ser36) (7Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) catalyzed by two IκB kinases (IKKs), 3The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinases; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ABIN-1, A20 binding inhibitor of NF-κB; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CIKS, connection to IκB kinase and SAPK. namely IKKα and IKKβ (8Di Donato J.A.

This step marks the IκB protein for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). The active NF-κB is then free for translocation to the nucleus, where it binds the κB sequences present in the promoters of responsive genes. IKKα and IKKβ reside in a larger kinase complex (700–900 kDa), called the IκB kinase complex (IKK complex), that also contains the essential regulatory subunit NEMO (also known as IKKγ) (13Yamaoka S.

Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Genetic studies suggest that NEMO/IKKγ is absolutely required for the activation of IKKs and NF-κB in response to different stimuli (13Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F.

Pasparakis M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). NEMO/IKKγ contains several coiled-coil domains, a leucine zipper, and a C-terminal zinc finger domain. These motifs are required for the correct assembly of the IKK complex (13Yamaoka S. Courtois G.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Numerous proteins have been demonstrated to interact with NEMO/IKKγ, as the kinase RIP and the inhibitor of NF-κB A20 (17Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), the viral trans-activator TAX (18Chu Z.L. Shin Y.A. Yang J.M. Di Donato J.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34323-34331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, NEMO/IKKγ represents the point where most NF-κB signaling pathways converge. Despite this information, the molecular mechanism regulating IKK complex function is not fully understood. Ubiquitin conjugation has been most prominently associated with protein degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway, but it is becoming increasingly evident that ubiquitination plays a key role in the signal transduction pathway leading to activation of NF-κB (24Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 25Liu Y.C. Penninger J. Karin M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Recent reports show that lysine 63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ is an important step for the activation of IKKs and NF-κB following various stimuli, such as TNF, lipopolysaccharide, and antigen receptor (26Tang E.D. Wang C.Y. Xiong Y. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37297-37305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Boone D.L. Turer E.E. Lee E.G. Ahmad R.C. Wheeler M.T. Tsui C.

Seshgirl S. Eby M. Xiao W. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In contrast, the tumor suppressor CYLD is reported as a negative regulator of NF-κB by specific de-ubiquitination of NF-κB signaling molecules, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and NEMO/IKKγ (29Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G. Nature. 2003; 424: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Also A20 functions as an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway by removing Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains from RIP, an essential mediator of the proximal TNF-Receptor-1 signaling complex. Then A20 targets RIP for Lys48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (30Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshgirl S. Wu P. Wlesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Furthermore, A20 terminates Toll-like receptor-induced NF-κB signaling, by cleaving ubiquitin chains from TRAF6 (27Boone D.L. Turer E.E. Lee E.G. Ahmad R.C. Wheeler M.T. Tsui C. Hurley P. Chien M. Chai S. Hitotsumatsu O. McNally E. Pickart C. Ma A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1052-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). The central role played by A20 in terminating NF-κB activation is further demonstrated by the fact that A20–/– mice develop severe inflammation and cachexia, are hypersensitive to both lipopolysaccharide and TNF, and die prematurely (27Boone D.L. Turer E.E. Lee E.G. Ahmad R.C. Wheeler M.T. Tsui C. Hurley P. Chien M. Chai S. Hitotsumatsu O. McNally E. Pickart C. Ma A. Nat.

Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Here we used NEMO/IKKγ as bait in yeast two-hybrid screening, and identified ABIN-1 (A20 binding inhibitor of NF-κB) as a NEMO/IKKγ-interacting protein. Cell Culture and Biological Reagents—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 1% glutamine. Anti-ABIN-1 polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits, by using a recombinant peptide encompassing amino acids 380–636 of human ABIN-1. Other antibodies used for this study were: FLAG epitope (Sigma), A20 (BD Pharmingen), HA epitope, NEMO/IKKγ, IKKβ, IκBα, and tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Human TNF-α (Peprotech Inc.) was used at 2,000 units/ml. Human ABIN-1 was amplified by PCR from a human liver c-DNA library (Clontech) and cloned into pcDNA3.1-HA, -FLAG, and -His vectors (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells. A20, TAX, and ubiquitin expression vectors were gifts from G. Natoli, T. K. Jeang, and G. Courtois, respectively. NEMO/IKKγ, IKKβ, CIKS, and TRAF2 expression vectors were previously described (21Leonardi A. Chariot A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10494-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 32Leonardi A. Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All deletion mutants were prepared by conventional PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1-HA or -FLAG vectors. Point mutants of A20 (C103S and D100A/C103S) were generated by the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The cDNA encoding the N-terminal part of mouse NEMO/IKKγ (amino acids 1–311) was cloned in-frame into the GAL-4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBKT7 (Clontech). The resulting plasmid pGBKT7-NEMO/IKKγ was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human liver cDNA library (Clontech) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109. The NEMO/IKKγ deletion mutants for two-hybrid mapping were made by conventional PCR and cloned into the pGBKT7 vector. Gel Filtration of Cellular Extracts—Gel filtration procedures were performed as previously described (42Mauro C. Vito P. Mellone S. Pacifico F. Chariot A. Formisano S. Leonardi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for ABIN-1, NEMO/IKKγ, and IKKβ. In Vitro Translation and GST Pull-down Assays—In vitro transcription and translation were carried out with 1 μg of ABIN-1 constructs according to the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System protocol (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. GST-NEMO/IKKγ fusion protein was produced and purified as described (33Chariot A. Princen F. Gielen J. Merville M.P. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Bours V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5318-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). GST pull-down assays were performed by incubating an aliquot of GST-NEMO/IKKγ bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) together with 10 μl of in vitro translated ABIN-1 protein in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100 buffer (including Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche)) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed five times with the same buffer, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and run on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel before autoradiography. Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Luciferase Assay— Lipofectamine-mediated transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). All transfections included supplemental empty vector to ensure that the total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant in each dish culture. For immunoprecipitation of transfected proteins, HEK293 cells (3 × 106) were transiently transfected and 24 h after transfection cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture). After an additional 15 min on ice, cell extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C and supernatants were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG antibodies bound to agarose beads (M2, Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For luciferase assay, HEK293 cells (4 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates. After 12 h cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of Ig-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid and various combinations of expression plasmids. 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with TNF-α for 3 h or left untreated. Cell extracts were prepared and reporter gene activity was determined via the luciferase assay system (Promega). Expression of the pRSV-β-galactosidase vector (0.2 μg) was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. In Vivo Ubiquitination and De-ubiquitination Assays— HEK293 cells (3 × 106) were co-transfected with expression vectors containing epitope-tagged ubiquitin (1 mg) and NEMO/IKKγ (200 ng), plus various constructs encoding A20 or ABIN-1 proteins. 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared as above and analyzed for polyubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ either by Western blot anti-NEMO/IKKγ (-FLAG) on total extracts or by immunoprecipitating FLAG-NEMO/IKKγ with anti-FLAG beads followed by Western blot anti-HA-ubiquitin. ABIN-1 Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Expression Vectors— To knockdown ABIN-1 expression, we designed double-stranded oligonucleotides containing sequences derived from the human ABIN-1 open reading frame (nucleotides 1136–1156 and 1685–1705) in forward and reverse orientations separated by a 7-base pair spacer region (caagaga) to allow the formation of the hairpin structure in the expressed siRNAs; ABINi-370: sense strand, 5′-aattcGAGGAGACCGACAAGGAGCAGcaagagaCTGCTCCTTGTCGGTCTCCTCtttttc; antisense strand, 5′-tcgagaaaaaGAGGAGACCGACAAGGAGCAGtctcttgCTGCTCCTTGTCGGTCTCCTCg; ABINi-560: sense strand, 5′-aattcCCACACCATGGCTTCGAGGACcaagagaGTCCTCGAAGCCATGGTGTGGtttttc; antisense strand, 5′-tcgagaaaaaCCACACCATGGCTTCGAGGACtctcttgGTCCTCGAAGCCATGGTGTGGg. The resulting double-stranded oligonucleotides were cloned into the pcRNAi vector that we derived from the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) by replacing the viral promoter cassette with the H1 gene promoter that is specifically recognized by RNA polymerase III. The plasmids used to knockdown A20 expression (pU6-A20i and the pU6) were a kind gift of Dr. S. Yamaoka and have been previously described (43Saitoh T. Yamamoto M. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Nakanishi M. Fujita T. Akira S. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). ABIN-1 Binds to NEMO/IKKγ—The regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, NEMO/IKKγ, has an essential role in NF-κB activation. To gain insights into how NEMO/IKKγ modulates the activation of NF-κB, we screened a human liver cDNA library for NEMO/IKKγ interacting proteins, via the yeast two-hybrid system. 25 clones were identified that expressed NEMO/IKKγ-interacting proteins, including IKKα and CARMA (23Stilo R. Liguoro D. Di Jeso B. Formisano S. Consiglio E. Leonardi A. Vito P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34323-34331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Three clones encoded for overlapping fragments of ABIN-1, a protein previously identified as an A20-binding protein that mimics the NF-κB inhibiting effects of A20 (34Heyninck K. De Valck D. Vanden Berghe W. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Fierz W. Haegeman G. Beyaert R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To define the region of NEMO/IKKγ that interacts with ABIN-1, we tested various deletion mutants of NEMO/IKKγ for binding to the ABIN-1 fragment (amino acids 380–636) in yeast. Data shown in Fig. 1A indicate that the region between amino acids 50 and 100 of NEMO/IKKγ is required for interaction with ABIN-1. The binding was confirmed in mammalian cells (Fig. 1B). HA-ABIN-1 was transiently coexpressed in HEK293 cells together with FLAG-NEMO/IKKγ or a NEMO/IKKγ mutant lacking the first 91 amino acids (FLAG-NEMOΔN91). Immunoprecipitates of FLAG-NEMO/IKKγ contained HA-ABIN-1 only if both proteins were co-expressed (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 3 and 4). In agreement with the data obtained in yeast, ABIN-1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with NEMOΔN91 (lane 6, Fig. 1B). We were unable to detect the association between endogenous NEMO/IKKγ and ABIN-1, probably because of the transient nature of the association and/or the high stringent conditions we used to perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments. However, gel filtration experiments showed that endogenous ABIN-1 was eluted from the column in the same fractions containing endogenous NEMO/IKKγ and other components of IKK complex (Fig. 1C). Mapping of the NEMO/IKKγ and the A20 Binding Domains on ABIN-1—To define the domain of ABIN-1 required for its interaction with NEMO/IKKγ, we performed pull-down assays by using recombinant GST-NEMO/IKKγ and in vitro translated [35S]ABIN-1 (Fig. 2A). ABIN-1 binds to GST-NEMO/IKKγ, indicating a direct interaction between the two proteins. Furthermore, amino acids 500–588 of ABIN-1 represent the minimal region that binds to NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 2A, upper panel). To confirm that the region between amino acids 500 and 588 of ABIN-1 was responsible for interaction with NEMO/IKKγ, we generated an internal deletion mutant of ABIN-1 (Δ500–588) and evaluated its ability to interact with NEMO/IKKγ. As expected, the internal deletion of 89 amino acids from ABIN-1 abolished the interaction with NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 2B). Because ABIN-1 was identified as an A20-interacting protein (35Heyninck K.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we confirmed that the region between amino acids 407 and 431 of ABIN-1 is responsible for interaction with A20 (Fig. 2C). Both ABIN-1 and A20 Inhibit NF-κB at the Level of the IKK Complex by Associating with NEMO/IKKγ—Both ABIN-1 and A20 are inhibitors of NF-κB. It has been proposed that they interfere with a RIP and TRAF2-mediated transactivation signal (34Heyninck K. De Valck D. Vanden Berghe W. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Fierz W. Haegeman G. Beyaert R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The identification of the interaction between ABIN-1 and NEMO/IKKγ prompted us to investigate if ABIN-1 was involved in controlling NF-κB activation not only upstream but also at the level of the IKK complex. To this aim, we performed reporter assays by transfecting HEK293 cells with the Ig-κB-luciferase plasmid in the presence of ABIN-1 and various activators of NF-κB. ABIN-1 efficiently inhibited TNF-α and TRAF2-dependent activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3A). ABIN-1 also blocked NF-κB activation induced by proteins acting at the level of the IKK complex, such as CIKS and TAX (18Chu Z.L. Shin Y.A. Yang J.M. Di Donato J.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 10494-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, ABIN-1 was not able to inhibit the IKKβ-mediated activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3A). Similarly, A20 inhibits NF-κB activation mediated by TNF-α or ectopic expression of TRAF2, CIKS, and TAX but not IKKβ (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that both ABIN-1 and A20 interfere with activation of NF-κB at the level of the IKK complex, suggesting that the association of ABIN-1 with NEMO/IKKγ could play an important role in the inhibition of NF-κB. Because ABIN-1 interacts with both NEMO/IKKγ and A20, we tested whether the NEMO/IKKγ- and A20-binding domains of ABIN-1 were required for inhibition of NF-κB. ABIN-1 deletion mutants lacking either the NEMO/IKKγ binding domain (ABINΔ500–588) or the A20 binding domain (ABINΔ407–431) were still able to inhibit the activity of a NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter following different stimuli (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, a mutant of ABIN-1 in which both the NEMO/IKKγ- and the A20-binding domains were deleted (ABINΔ407–431/Δ500–588) lost the ability to block activation of NF-κB (Fig. 4C). These data were consistent with the hypothesis that ABIN-1 forms a complex with both NEMO/IKKγ and A20. To address this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-NEMO/IKKγ and monitored the co-precipitation of the ABIN-1 mutant lacking the NEMO/IKKγ-binding domain (HA-ABINΔ500–588) either in the presence or absence of A20 (Fig. 4D). ABINΔ500–588 co-immunoprecipitated with NEMO/IKKγ only in the presence of A20 (Fig. 4D). To further support the idea that ABIN-1 promotes association of A20 with NEMO/IKKγ, we transfected A20 and NEMO/IKKγ in the presence of an increasing amount of overexpressed ABIN-1. As expected, the amount of A20 co-immunoprecipitating with NEMO/IKKγ increased in the presence of ABIN-1 (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data indicated that ABIN-1 interferes with activation of NF-κB at the level of the IKK complex, and support the idea that ABIN-1 promotes association of A20 with NEMO/IKKγ. A20 Inhibits NF-κB by De-ubiquitinating NEMO/IKKγ—To explore the mechanism by which the interactions of both A20 and ABIN-1 with NEMO/IKKγ down-regulate NF-κB signaling, we assessed the effect of either A20 or ABIN-1 on NEMO/IKKγ ubiquitination. Transfection of FLAG-NEMO/IKKγ in the presence of HA-ubiquitin results in the polyubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 5A, lane 3). Co-transfection of A20 and NEMO/IKKγ resulted in a dose-dependent disappearance of the ubiquitinated forms of NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, co-transfection of ABIN-1 did not affect NEMO/IKKγ ubiquitination (Fig. 5A, lanes 6 and 7). We did not observe reduction in the overall level of ubiquitinated cellular proteins in the presence of A20, indicating that A20 does not have a global de-ubiquitinating activity in cultured cells (Fig. 5A). Importantly, A20 also blocks IκBα degradation and NEMO/IKKγ ubiquitination induced by TNF-α (Fig. 5B). To demonstrate that the de-ubiquitinating activity of A20 was required for the observed reduction in NEMO/IKKγ ubiquitination, we generated two mutants in the OTU domain of A20, which is the domain responsible for the de-ubiquitinating activity of A20 (36Evans P.C. Smith T.S. Lai M.J. Williams M.G. Burke D.F. Heyninck K. Kreike M.M. Beyaert R. Blundell T.L. Kilshaw P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23180-23186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We replaced the cysteine residue of the DXXC motif with serine (C103S), and both the aspartic acid and the cysteine residues (D100A/C103S) with alanine and serine, respectively. The mutation C103S affected the ability of A20 to de-ubiquitinate NEMO/IKKγ compared with wild type A20, whereas the double mutant D100A/C103S resulted in the complete loss of the de-ubiquitinating activity of A20 on NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 5C). As expected, the D100A/C103S mutant was not able to block the NF-κB activity induced by different stimuli, such as TRAF2 (Fig. 5D and data not shown). These findings strongly suggest that NEMO/IKKγ is a target of the de-ubiquitinating activity of A20 and confirmed that the ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ is a crucial step in the mechanisms of NF-κB activation. ABIN-1 Mediates the De-ubiquitinating Activity of A20 on NEMO/IKKγ—Next, we explored whether ABIN-1 was involved in the A20-dependent de-ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ. To this purpose, we transfected HEK293 cells with a suboptimal amount of A20 and an increasing amount of ABIN-1 and checked for NEMO/IKKγ ubiquitination. We found that ABIN-1 increases the ability of A20 to de-ubiquitinate NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 6A). To demonstrate a role for ABIN-1 in the A20-mediated de-ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ, we generated siRNA constructs targeting ABIN-1 (ABINi-370 and i-560). Fig. 6B shows that the construct i-370 knocked-down ABIN-1 expression, whereas the i-560 construct did not. Then, we evaluated whether interference of ABIN-1 impairs the de-ubiquitinating activity of A20 on NEMO/IKKγ. We co-transfected HEK293 cells with FLAG-NEMO/IKKγ and HA-ubiquitin and assessed the de-ubiquitinating activity of A20 alone or in the presence of either i-370 or i-560 constructs. The A20-dependent de-ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ decreased only in the presence of the i-370 construct (Fig. 6C). The i-370 construct led to a 2-fold increase of both basal and induced (TRAF2 and CIKS) NF-κB activity compared with the empty vector or the i-560 construct, which we used as controls (Fig. 6D). Accordingly with the data shown in Fig. 3A, interference of ABIN-1 did not influence the activation of the NF-κB-dependent transfected IKKβ. Also in this case, NF-κB activity correlated with the levels of NEMO/IKKγ ubiquitination. In fact, transfected i-370 increased the ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ with respect to both empty vector and i-560 (data not shown). From these experiments, we concluded that reduced levels of the ABIN-1 protein affect the ability of A20 to de-ubiquitinate NEMO/IKKγ and, consequently the A20-mediated inhibition of NF-κB. To further support the functional interplay between ABIN-1 and A20, we knocked-down A20 (43Saitoh T. Yamamoto M. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Nakanishi M. Fujita T. Akira S. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and evaluated the ability of ABIN-1 to interfere with NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 6E, ABIN-1 requires A20 to efficiently block NF-κB activation induced by TNF and TRAF2. In the present study, we have performed experiments in yeast, in vitro and in transfected cells demonstrating that ABIN-1 physically associates with NEMO/IKKγ. The functional consequence of this interaction is that overexpression of ABIN-1 blocks not only activation of NF-κB upstream of the IKK complex, but also NF-κB activation mediated by proteins directly contacting the IKK complex, such as CIKS and TAX. Indeed, activation of NF-κB mediated by overexpression of IKKβ, which may be considered functionally downstream of NEMO/IKKγ, is not affected by ABIN-1. ABIN-1 has been identified as an A20-binding protein and its overexpression mimics the inhibitory effect of A20, suggesting that ABIN-1, at least partially, mediates the inhibitory function of A20. A20 is a TNF-α responsive gene that inhibits NF-κB-dependent gene transcription in response to TNF-α and other stimuli (37Dixit V.M. Green S. Sarma V. Holzman L.B. Wolf F.W. O'Rourke K. Ward P.A.

Given that A20 expression itself is regulated by NF-κB, it is possible that A20 and ABIN-1 participate in a negative feedback regulation of NF-κB activation (40Laherty C.D. Hu H.M. Opipari A.W. Wuang F. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24157-24160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Krikos A. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17971-17976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which ABIN-1 participates in this process is not clear. We provide evidence that ABIN-1 and A20 co-operate to promote de-ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ, which results in functional inactivation of NF-κB. In fact, recent studies have indicated ubiquitination as a key event in the regulation of NF-κB activation. For example, A20 modifies the ubiquitination profile of RIP in a two-step model, by removing the Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain and by the subsequent ligation of the Lys48-linked ubiquitin chain (30Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshgirl S. Wu P. Wlesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Similarly, A20 inhibits Toll-like receptor signaling by removing the Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain from TRAF6 (27Boone D.L. Turer E.E. Lee E.G. Ahmad R.C. Wheeler M.T. Tsui C. Hurley P. Chien M. Chai S. Hitotsumatsu O. McNally E. Pickart C. Ma A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1052-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). In this context our data demonstrate that NEMO/IKKγ is an additional target of the de-ubiquitinating activity of A20. Currently, it is not clear if A20 directly de-ubiquitinates NEMO/IKKγ, or it affects the activity of other protein(s) regulating NEMO/IKKγ ubiquitination. However, we have now shown that in cells knocked-down for ABIN-1, we observed a decrease in the ability of A20 to de-ubiquitinate NEMO/IKKγ, and that in cells knocked-down for A20, the inhibitory function of ABIN-1 is impaired. Altogether our data strongly suggest that ABIN-1 functionally connects A20 and NEMO/IKKγ. In summary, we have identified a previously not reported association between ABIN-1 and NEMO/IKKγ and we provide evidence that ABIN-1 co-operates with A20 in inhibiting NF-κB at the level of the IKK complex. In addition, we propose that this association could target A20 on NEMO/IKKγ and interfere with NEMO/IKKγ ubiquitination, to negatively regulate NF-κB activation.

https://openalex.org/W2067617459,"The programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) gene was originally identified as a tumor-related gene in humans and acts as a tumor-suppressor in mouse epidermal carcinoma cells. However, its function and regulatory mechanisms of expression in human cancer remain to be elucidated. We therefore investigated the expression of PDCD4 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the role of PDCD4 in human HCC cells. Downregulation of PDCD4 protein was observed in all HCC tissues tested compared with corresponding noncancerous liver, as revealed by Western blotting or immunohistochemical staining. Human HCC cell line, Huh7, transfected with PDCD4 cDNA showed nuclear fragmentation and DNA laddering characteristic of apoptotic cells associated with mitochondrial changes and caspase activation. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) treatment of Huh7 cells resulted in increased PDCD4 expression and occurrence of apoptosis, also concomitant with mitochondrial events and caspase activation. Transfection of Smad7, a known antagonist to TGF-β1 signaling, protected cells from TGF-β1-mediated apoptosis and suppressed TGF-β1-induced PDCD4 expression. Moreover, antisense PDCD4 transfectants were resistant to apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. In conclusion, these data suggest that PDCD4 is a proapoptotic molecule involved in TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in human HCC cells, and a possible tumor suppressor in hepatocarcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2062200101,"The mouse genome sequence has been examined to identify the complete set of proteins related to the human glycanbinding receptor, DC-SIGN. In addition to five SIGNR proteins previously described, a pseudogene, encoding a hypothetical SIGNR6, and a further two expressed proteins, SIGNR7 and SIGNR8, have been identified. The ligand-binding properties of these novel proteins and of the previously described mouse SIGNs have been systematically investigated in order to define the mouse proteins that most resemble human DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. Results from screening of a glycan array demonstrate that only mouse SIGNR3 shares with human DC-SIGN the ability to bind both high mannose and fucose-terminated glycans in this format and to mediate endocytosis. The finding that neither SIGNR1 nor SIGNR5 binds with high affinity to specific ligands in a large panel of mammalian glycans is consistent with the suggestion that these receptors bind surface polysaccharides on bacterial and fungal pathogens in a manner analogous to serum mannose-binding protein. The data also reveal that two of the mouse SIGNs have unusual binding specificities that have not been previously described for members of the C-type lectin family; the newly identified SIGNR7 binds preferentially to the 6-sulfo-sialyl Lewisx oligosaccharide, whereas SIGNR2 binds almost exclusively to glycans that bear terminal GlcNAc residues.

Both of these receptors have been of considerable interest because of their ability to bind human immunodeficiency virus and present it to CD4-positive T cells, greatly facilitating the efficiency of infection (4.Pöhlmann S.

There is also evidence that these receptors interact with bacterial pathogens and with parasites (7.Appelmelk B.J. van Die I. van Vliet S.J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls M.J.E.

Although the original names do not encompass all of the functions and expression patterns of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, these acronyms have generally been retained and used as simple designations for the molecules. Both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR bind to surface glycoproteins of viruses by interacting with high mannose oligosaccharides. They bind with highest affinity to larger glycans that contain 8 or 9 mannose residues (8.Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

In addition, DC-SIGN, but not DC-SIGNR, binds to fucose-containing glycans, such as those present on the surfaces of nematode parasites (7.Appelmelk B.J. van Die I. van Vliet S.J.

The sugar-binding activity of each protein is conferred by a C-type or Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate recognition domain that is located at the C terminus of the receptor polypeptide. This domain is separated from the membrane anchor by a neck region consisting of multiple 23-amino acid repeats. The neck forms an extended structure that associates to create a tetramer at the cell surface (10.Feinberg H. Guo Y. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1327-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Signals in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of DC-SIGN direct internalization of the receptor, which can thus mediate endocytosis and degradation of glycoproteins (9.Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Blixt O. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). DC-SIGNR lacks such signals and seems not to be a recycling receptor. Initial screening of mouse cDNA libraries led to the identification of multiple mouse homologs of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. These have been designated DC-SIGN and SIGNR1 through SIGNR4 (11.Park C.G. Takahara K. Umemoto E. Yashima Y. Matsubara K. Matsuda Y. Clausen B.E. Inaba K. Steinman R.M. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1283-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Based on the sequences and expression patterns of these molecules, it has been difficult to define which of the cDNAs encode the mouse molecules that perform functions analogous to the two human proteins. Identification of such “functional orthologs” is essential if mice are to be useful models for illuminating the biology of human DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. Since it is not clear that the molecule originally designated mouse DC-SIGN is the closest homolog of human DC-SIGN, it is referred to here as SIGNR5. In the present work, further mouse homologs of the human SIGNs have been identified, and the biochemical and cell biological properties of all the mouse SIGNs have been compared. The results reflect recent, independent divergence of the SIGN family in the human and mouse lineages. The ligand-binding specificity of mouse SIGNR3 is most like human DC-SIGN, whereas several of the other mouse SIGNs have properties that are distinct from either of the human receptors. Data Base Screening—The Ensembl annotation of the mouse genome was screened with InterPro profile IPR001304 to identify genes containing potential C-type CRDs. One of the genes (encoding SIGNR6) was identified in earlier screening of the genome annotation but is not currently identified as a gene. Similar searches of the SwissProt and GenBank™ sequence data bases were performed. DC-SIGN homologs were distinguished from the general pool of C-type lectins based on the presence of a characteristic extra disulfide bond found only in human DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, and CD23 as well as overall relatedness of sequences. The complete set of C-type lectin-like proteins is described in the Genomic Resource for Animal Lectins (available on the World Wide Web at www.imperial.ac.uk/research/animallectins). Cluster analysis was performed using the AlignX software from Informax. cDNA Screening and Cloning—Primers of 30-36 nucleotides were designed from the genomic sequences and cDNAs for SIGN R1, R3, and R5 were amplified from spleen, SIGN R2, R4 and R7 from lung, and SIGN R8 from liver cDNA libraries using the Advantage 2 polymerase (both from Clontech) following the PCR protocol described previously (12.Fadden A.J. Holt O.J. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and were cloned using the TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). Multiple clones were sequenced, and, where necessary, portions of different cDNAs were combined to create error-free clones. PCR screening of tissues was conducted with a panel of mouse cDNAs (Clontech) using 1 μl of template in the same PCR protocol run for 30 cycles. Protein Expression and Purification—For expression in bacteria, a fragment of each receptor encoding the extracellular domain was preceded by the nucleotides encoding the sequence Met-Ala in the expression vector pT5T. Expression of the protein and isolation of inclusion bodies followed the procedure used for human DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (8.Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies from 6 liters of bacteria were solubilized in 100 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl containing 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, and renatured following various different schemes. In the direct dialysis protocol, the protein was dialyzed against three changes of 20 volumes of loading buffer (1.25 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, and 25 mm CaCl2). In the dilution protocol, the sample was diluted slowly into five volumes of loading buffer and dialyzed against three changes of 10 volumes of loading buffer. In some cases, 1% Triton X-100 was added to the sample in guanidine before dilution. Following dialysis against loading buffer, some of the samples were dialyzed further into water, lyophilized, and dissolved in one-twentieth of their original volume of loading buffer. After each sample was spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a 5-ml column of mannose-Sepharose prepared by the divinyl sulfone method (13.Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Columns were washed with 20 ml of loading buffer and eluted with 10 ml of elution buffer (1.25 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, and 2.5 mm EDTA). For proteins that bound less tightly, 2-ml fractions were collected during the wash, and in all cases, 1-ml fractions were collected during elution. Fractions were examined on 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were stained with Coomassie Blue. Formation of Tetrameric Proteins—Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to append sequences encoding a short glycine linker followed by the biotinylation sequence Gly-Leu-Asn-Asp-Ile-Phe-Glu-Ala-Gln-Lys-Ile-Glu-Trp-His-Glu at the C termini of the extracellular domain fragments (14.Schatz P.J. Biotechnology. 1993; 11: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21/DE3 containing plasmid pACYC-184 with the birA gene (Avidity, Denver, CO) and grown in the presence of 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. For most of the proteins, tetramers were formed following protein expression as described above. Fractions from the affinity columns were pooled and adjusted to 25 mm CaCl2, and streptavidin (Sigma) was added to approximately half the concentration of the tagged protein and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Complexes were isolated by affinity chromatography on 2-ml columns of mannose-Sepharose that were washed with 10 ml of loading buffer and eluted with 5 ml of elution buffer. In some cases, streptavidin was added directly to the renatured protein before affinity chromatography. Binding Studies—Solid-phase competition assays and pH dependence assays were both performed using CRDs immobilized on polystyrene and probed with 125I-Man-BSA (E-Y Laboratories) as described before. Additional binding assays with fluorescein-labeled, glycosylated polyacrylamide polymers (GlycoTech) were performed in the same format and read on a Victor3 plate reader from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. In these studies, the buffer was 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2, with 1% BSA present during ligand binding. Following subtraction of background, the results were fitted to a simple binding equation (ligand bound proportional to ligand input/(KD + ligand input)) using SigmaPlot software. For probing of the glycan array, tetramerized proteins were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (9.Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Blixt O. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I.

The array was screened by Core H of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics following their standard protocol. Protein Characterization—Cross-linking with bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate and analytical ultracentrifugation were performed following published procedures. Gel filtration was performed on a Superose 20 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, and 2.5 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Assay of Endocytic Activity—Full-length cDNAs inserted into the vector pVcos along with the neomycin resistance gene were transfected into Rat-6 fibroblasts (15.Stambach N.S. Taylor M.E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Following selection in 400 μg/ml G418, individual clones were selected and tested for endocytosis and degradation of 125I-mannose-BSA (16.Mellow T.E. Halberg D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5468-5473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein expression was verified by Western blotting with antibodies to the bacterially expressed extracellular domain, raised in sheep. Sequence Comparisons of Mouse SIGNs—Potential mouse orthologs of human DC-SIGN were previously identified by screening of cDNAs from mouse dendritic cells and other cells of the immune system. In order to complement this approach, the annotated mouse genomic sequence and the SwissProt and GenBank™ data bases were screened for sequences that contain profile matches to the C-type CRD motif. The CRDs from these sequences were excised and subjected to cluster analysis, leading to identification of eight possible genes containing CRDs that are closely related to the human DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR sequences. In addition to overall sequence similarity, the potential CRDs encoded in these sequences contain an extra disulfide bond that is characteristic of human DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR as well as CD23, the lymphocyte low affinity IgE Fc receptor, and another recently described sugar-binding receptor designated LSECtin. The genes encoding each of these DC-SIGN homologs are located between 3.0 and 3.5 megabases on mouse chromosome 8, directly adjacent to the genes encoding CD23 and LSECtin (Fig. 1). Five of the genes encode the previously described mouse SIGNR1 to -R5, whereas three novel genes were identified, and the encoded proteins were designated SIGNR6, SIGNR7, and SIGNR8. cDNAs corresponding to SIGNR7 and -R8 have been characterized as part of the RIKEN large scale cDNA sequencing project. The probable domain organization of the expanded mouse SIGN family is shown in Fig. 2. The sequence for SIGNR6 does not appear to encode a full-length CRD, because the N-terminal part of the deduced sequence does not contain characteristic cysteine residues and hydrophobic amino acids. It has previously been noted that SIGNR2 lacks a membrane anchor. The remaining mouse SIGNs have relatively short neck regions compared with the human proteins. The relationships between the neck regions are summarized in diagrammatic form in Fig. 2. Each of the mouse SIGNs except SIGNR6 contains a sequence immediately preceding the CRD that is somewhat similar to the sequence repeated seven times in the human proteins. This sequence is repeated four times in SIGNR1 and twice in SIGNR2 but with different intermediate spacers (Fig. 3). The remaining SIGNs do not have repeated sequences and thus have very short neck regions.FIGURE 3Aligned sequences of human and mouse SIGNs. Top, tyrosine residues and paired hydrophobic residues in the cytoplasmic tails are highlighted in blue, and membrane-spanning sequences are highlighted in green. Middle, heptad repeats of hydrophobic amino acids in the neck regions are highlighted in green, and potential N-linked glycosylation sites are marked in pink. An extra segment present in some alternatively spliced cDNAs for SIGNR8 is indicated. Bottom, amino acid residues that form Ca2+-binding site 1 in the carbohydrate-recognition domains are highlighted in blue, and residues that form Ca2+-binding site 2 and the primary sugar-binding site are shaded pink. Conserved cysteine residues involved in disulfide bonds are noted in yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the predicted sequences of SIGNR6, -R7, and -R8, primers were designed and used to amplify corresponding cDNAs from libraries constructed from various mouse tissues. The cDNAs for mouse SIGNR7 and SIGNR8 were detected in multiple tissues (Fig. 4), but no signal for SIGNR6 was detected using any of three different forward and reverse primers. These results, combined with the truncated 3′ end of the gene, suggest that the SIGNR6 gene is a pseudogene. cDNAs for SIGNR7 and -R8 were successfully cloned, and the cDNA for SIGNR7 exactly matched the genomic sequence as well as the amended cDNA sequence deposited in the GenBank™ data base under accession number XM_284376. The cDNA for SIGNR8 matched the genomic sequence but differed from the cDNA deposited as XM_284386 in GenBank™ because of the absence of a short inserted sequence just before the CRD (Fig. 3). The cDNA in the data base would result from alternative splicing at the 5′ end of exon 6 and corresponds to a slightly larger messenger RNA detected as a secondary band in the PCRs shown in Fig. 4. The relationships between the sequences of the CRDs from the human and mouse SIGNs are summarized in the dendrogram in Fig. 5. The most striking finding is that the two human proteins are more closely related to each other than they are to any of the mouse SIGNs. Thus, although the human and mouse families have a common ancestor, they have radiated independently in the lineages leading to the two species, and it is therefore not possible to identify individual mouse orthologs of either of the two human proteins. Because these findings make it difficult to predict which mouse proteins share functions with the human proteins based on sequence alone, further biochemical characterization was undertaken. Demonstration of Carbohydrate-binding Activity of Mouse SIGNs—The sequences of the CRDs of all but one of the expressed mouse SIGNs show conservation of the key residues that form Ca2+- and carbohydrate-binding sites in these proteins (Fig. 3). Therefore, it seemed likely that most would bind some combination of mannose- or fucose-containing ligands like the human SIGNs. Fragments corresponding to the extracellular domains of each protein were expressed in a bacterial expression system previously used to generate high levels of the human proteins. Following denaturation of protein from inclusion bodies using guanidine hydrochloride, various methods for renaturation were tested, involving dialysis or rapid dilution followed by dialysis, either in the presence or absence of Triton X-100. The proteins were then passed over affinity columns containing high densities of immobilized mannose in the presence of Ca2+ and eluted with EDTA. In some cases, yields were improved by concentrating the renatured proteins by dialysis against water and lyophilization. Of the seven mouse SIGN extracellular domains that were expressed, five were purified successfully by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose (Table 1 and Fig. 6). However, several of the proteins bound relatively poorly and could be washed off shorter affinity columns even in the presence of Ca2+. This behavior was previously observed for the CRDs of the human SIGNs, which are monomeric, whereas the tetramers formed by the full extracellular domains bind tightly and can only be eluted with EDTA. Sedimentation and cross-linking analysis of the five mouse proteins that could be purified by affinity chromatography revealed that four are clearly monomeric and show no self-association. Only SIGNR3 associates weakly to form dimers in equilibrium analytical centrifugation experiments (data not shown). Thus, like the human proteins, the CRDs in these mouse SIGNs bind with modest affinity to mannose-Sepharose. However, in contrast to the human proteins, the neck segments of the mouse SIGNs are insufficient to form stable oligomers.TABLE 1Binding properties of human and mouse SIGNsProteinAlternate namesPurification protocolKI, Fucose / KI, MannosepKBHu-DC-SIGNCD209Diluted, lyophilized0.6 ± 0.1aData from Ref. 8.5.92 ± 0.05bData from Ref. 9.Hu-DC-SIGNRCD209L, L-SIGNDiluted, lyophilized1.7 ± 0.1aData from Ref. 8.Mo-SIGNR1CD209BStreptavidin complex0.76 ± 0.125.95 ± 0.05Mo-SIGNR2CD209CDiluted1.0 ± 0.16.08 ± 0.04Mo-SIGNR3CD209DDiluted0.62 ± 0.036.41 ± 0.07Mo-SIGNR4CD209EMo-SIGNR5CD209A, DC-SIGNDiluted, lyophilized1.21 ± 0.06Mo-SIGNR6Mo-SIGNR7Undiluted0.60 ± 0.155.66 ± 0.06Mo-SIGNR8Undiluted1.9 ± 0.16.22 ± 0.05cReverse dependence on pH.a Data from Ref. 8.Mitchell D.A.

Open table in a new tab It was notable that SIGNR1 is one of the two mouse SIGNs that was not successfully purified on mannose-Sepharose, although this protein has been reported to bind to dextran, mannan, and other bacterial surface polysaccharides (17.Geijtenbeek T.B.H.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The results for the other mouse SIGNs suggested that this lack of binding might reflect particularly weak affinity of monomeric CRDs for the immobilized monosaccharide. In order to improve the binding characteristics of the mouse SIGNs, sequences containing a single lysine residue in an appropriate context for biotinylation by biotin ligase were appended to the C-terminal ends of each of them (21.Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 359-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These proteins were expressed in bacteria co-expressing the bacterial birA gene, which encodes biotin ligase. Blotting studies with radioiodinated streptavidin revealed that this procedure resulted in efficient biotinylation of each of the tagged proteins (data not shown). Purification results for the proteins containing biotin tags were identical to those for the CRDs alone, so that four of the tagged proteins could be isolated using mannose-Sepharose. Following incubation with streptavidin, these proteins could be repurified by affinity chromatography, and in each case, they now bound tightly to the column and required EDTA for elution (Fig. 6B). Analysis by gel filtration chromatography revealed that most of these complexes are homogeneous species with molecular weights corresponding to four extracellular domain fragments complexed with a single streptavidin tetramer. Similar complexes of SIGNR1 were also observed, but there was also evidence of aggregation, probably reflecting the propensity of the extended neck region in this extracellular domain fragment to self-associate. Based on these results, further attempts were made to purify SIGNR1 and -R4, which were precomplexed with streptavidin following renaturation. This procedure led to the successful isolation of a tetrameric streptavidin-SIGNR1 complex that bound well to mannose-Sepharose and eluted with EDTA (Fig. 6). However, no binding activity was observed for SIGNR4. This finding is probably not surprising, since SIGNR4 is the only mouse SIGN in which some of the residues that ligate the critical Ca2+ that forms the core of the primary sugar-binding site differ from the pattern seen in the human SIGNs and other mannose-binding C-type CRDs (Fig. 3). Although it remains possible that this protein binds to other sugars, these findings indicate that it is unlikely to function as an ortholog of the human SIGNs. Carbohydrate-binding Activities of Mouse SIGNs—Initial characterization of the sugar-binding characteristics of the six mannose-binding mouse SIGNs was undertaken using solidphase competition binding assays in which 125I-mannose-BSA served as a reporter ligand. The purified extracellular domains of SIGNR2, -R3, -R5, -R7, and -R8 were used to coat polystyrene wells, whereas the tetrameric form of SIGNR1 was used. The relative abilities of mannose and fucose to compete for binding were compared, since the ratio of inhibition constants for these two sugars distinguishes the two human SIGNs. The results, which are summarized in Table 1, reveal that mouse SIGNR1, -R3, and -R7 all show preferential binding to fucose over mannose, with a ratio of KI values that is similar to the value of 0.6 obtained for human DC-SIGN. Only SIGNR5 and -R8 show preferential binding to mannose, to an extent similar to that observed for human DC-SIGNR. Mouse SIGNR2 seems to bind equally well to mannose and fucose. Thus, to a first approximation, the best candidates for functional orthologs of human DC-SIGN are SIGNR1, -R3, and -R7. Further insights into the binding characteristics of the mouse SIGNs were obtained by screening a glycan array using fluorescently labeled proteins. Preliminary tests with some of the monomeric forms of the extracellular domains indicated that these did not bind with sufficient affinity to yield good results in the array, so the tetrameric complexes of biotin-tagged proteins were used in all cases. The glycan array contains over 170 mono- and oligosaccharides immobilized as biotin glycosides bound to streptavidin-coated wells. Despite the fact that the tetrameric forms of mouse SIGNR1 and -R5 bind well to man-nos"

Here, we suppressed FAK activity in 4T1 breast carcinoma cells resulting in reduced FAK Y925 phosphorylation, Grb2 adaptor protein binding to FAK, and signaling to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK). Loss of a FAK-Grb2-MAPK linkage did not affect 4T1 cell proliferation or survival in culture, yet FAK inhibition reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and resulted in small avascular tumors in mice. This FAK-Grb2-MAPK linkage was essential in promoting angiogenesis as reconstitution experiments using Src-transformed FAK-null fibroblasts revealed that point mutations affecting FAK catalytic activity (R454) or Y925 phosphorylation (F925) disrupted the ability of FAK to promote MAPK- and VEGF-associated tumor growth. Notably, in both FAK-inhibited 4T1 and Src-transformed FAK-null cells, constitutively activated (CA) mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) restored VEGF production and CA-MEK1 or added VEGF rescued tumor growth and angiogenesis. These studies provide the first biological support for Y925 FAK phosphorylation and define a novel role for FAK activity in promoting a MAPK-associated angiogenic switch during tumor progression."

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been linked with the proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis of tumors (22.Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Most of these TNF effects are mediated through the activation of NF-κB, activated protein 1 (AP-1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p44/p42 MAPK, and Akt (22.Aggarwal B.B.

For example, the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 regulates the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis. It is known that the TNF cell-signaling pathway is regulated by the redox status of the cell (23.Garg A.K. Aggarwal B.B. Mol.

Therefore, our purpose in this study was to determine the role of NQO1 in TNF cell signaling by using cells derived from NQO1 gene-deleted mice. We found that NQO1 is required for the TNF-induced activation of NF-κB, IκBα kinase (IKK), JNK, Akt, p38, and p44/p42 MAPK. We also found that NF-κB-regulated gene products, such as IAP1, IAP2, XIAP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, cFLIP, survivin, cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, were down-regulated by the deletion of NQO1, which resulted in the potentiation of TNF-induced apoptosis. Reagents—Bacteria-derived recombinant murine TNF, purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5 × 107 units/mg, was kindly provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Penicillin, streptomycin, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) was kindly provided by Dr. C. Gary Gariola (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and an anti-β-actin antibody were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The antibodies anti-p65, anti-p50, anti-IκBα, anti-cyclin D1, anti-MMP-9, anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, anti-IAP1, anti-IAP2, anti-Bcl-xL, and anti-Bcl-2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-COX-2 antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences. The phospho-specific anti-IκBα (Ser-32) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-IKK-α, anti-IKK-β, and anti-FLIP antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex (San Diego, CA). A polyclonal antibody that recognizes the serine 529 phosphorylated form of p65 was obtained from Rockland Laboratories (Gilbertsville, PA). Cell Lines—The mouse keratinocytes from benzo[a]pyrene-induced wild-type and NQO1–/– mouse skin tumors were established by standard procedures. Briefly, the tumors were removed and placed in high calcium (200 mm) supplemented with antibiotics and antimitotic agents. The tumors were exposed to collagenase at 37 °C for 2 h with agitation. The settled clumps were gently removed from the supernatant, washed twice with high calcium buffer, exposed to high calcium/keratinocyte growth factor, and plated in the four corner wells of collagen (Invitrogen)-coated 12-well plate. The medium was replaced with low calcium (50 mm)/keratinocyte growth factor and replaced every 2–3 days. The growing keratinocyte cells were collected and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The karyotyping analysis did not reveal loss and/or gain or translocation of chromosome(s) in established skin tumor cells (data not shown). Cell-surface Expression of TNF Receptors—For analysis of cell-surface expression of TNF receptors (TNFRs), cells were harvested and suspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% sodium azide. The cells were preincubated with 10% goat serum for 20 min and washed, and then monoclonal rabbit IgG anti-TNFR1/R2 antibodies were added. Following a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the cells were washed and incubated for an additional 1 h in fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG monoclonal antibodies. The cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) and acquisition and analysis programs (CellQuest, BD Biosciences). NQO1 Enzyme Activity—Wild-type keratinocytes and human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells were grown in monolayers and treated with 1 nm TNFα for different time intervals. The cells were harvested, homogenized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h to obtain cytosolic fractions. Dicoumarol-sensitive NQO1 activity was measured in cytosolic fractions by previously described procedure (25.Shaw P.M. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nebert D.W. Schembri J. Jaiswal A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The final reaction mixture contained 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.18 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm FAD, 0.01% Tween 20, 200 mm NADH, 50 mm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, and 0.2–2.0 mg of cytosolic proteins. The reaction was monitored by measuring the decrease in absorbance due to reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol at 600 nm. This gave us total NQO activity. The same experiment was repeated in the presence of 20 mm NQO1-specific inhibitor dicoumarol. The activity obtained in the presence of dicoumarol was subtracted from the total activity to obtain the dicoumarol-inhibitable NQO1 activity. The experiments were independently repeated three times. siRNA Inhibition of NQO1 Activity and Protein—HCT116 cells were grown in monolayer culture. Pre-designed NQO1 siRNA was purchased from Ambion, Austin, TX (siRNA ID# 8953). The HCT116 cells were transfected with scrambled or NQO1-specific siRNA using the HiPerFect transfection kit from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) by using the procedure as suggested in the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were harvested and homogenized, and nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared using a kit and instruction manual from Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA. The cytosolic fractions were analyzed for NQO1 activity by using a previously described procedure, and NQO1 protein was analyzed by Western blotting and probing with anti-NQO1 antibody. The nuclear fractions were analyzed for NF-κB binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments. EMSA—To assess NF-κB activation, we performed EMSAs as previously described (26.Chaturvedi M.M. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 319: 585-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells (1 × 106/ml) were incubated with a 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (15 μg of protein with 16 fmol of DNA) from the human immunodeficiency virus long-terminal repeat, 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (boldface indicates NF-κB-binding sites) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide (5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′) was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined by competition with the unlabeled oligonucleotide. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with antibodies against either p50 or p65 from NF-κB for 30 min at 37 °C before the complex was analyzed by EMSA. Antibodies against cyclin D1 and preimmune serum were included as negative controls. The dried gels were visualized, and radioactive bands were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). Western Blot Analysis—To determine the levels of protein expression in the cytoplasm or the nucleus, we prepared extracts of TNF-treated cells from each and fractionated them by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blotted with each antibody, and detected by electrochemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were quantitated with densitometry (Personal Densitometer Scan version 1.30) and ImageQuaNT software version 3.3 (both from Molecular Dynamics). IKK Assay—The IKK assay was performed by a method described previously (27.Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4750-4759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, IKK complexes from whole cell extracts were precipitated with an antibody against IKK-α, after which they were treated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). After a 2-h incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and then assayed in a kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μg of substrate glutathione S-transferase-IκBα (amino acids 1–54). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling the beads with an SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE; the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized by the PhosphorImager. To determine the total amounts of IKK-α and IKK-β in each sample, 50 μg of the whole cell protein was resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with either an anti-IKK-α or an anti-IKK-β antibody. AP-1 Activation Assay—To assay AP-1 activation with EMSA, we incubated 6 μg of nuclear extract protein with 16 fmol of the 32P-end-labeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (boldface indicates the AP-1 binding site) for 15 min at 37 °C, after which the DNA-protein complexes formed were resolved from free oligonucleotide on 6% native polyacrylamide gels. The specificity of binding was examined by a competition assay with unlabeled oligonucleotide. The radioactive bands were visualized and quantified as indicated above. NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Expression Assay—To examine TNF-induced reporter gene expression, we placed cells (3 × 105) in 6-well plates and transiently transfected them by using the calcium phosphate method with 0.5 μg of pNF-κB-secretory alkaline phosphatase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and the control plasmid pCMVFLAG1 DNA (2 μg). After 24 h, cells were washed, exposed to 1 nm TNF for 24 h, harvested from the cell culture medium, and then analyzed for secretory alkaline phosphatase activity, essentially according to the protocol described by the manufacturer, with a 96-well fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroscan II, Labsystems, Chicago, IL) with its excitation set at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. MTT Assay—The cell growth effects of TNF were determined by the MTT uptake method as described. Briefly, 2 × 103 cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates and then treated with various concentrations of TNF for 48 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, MTT solution was added to each well. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, an extraction buffer (20% SDS and 50% dimethylformamide) was added; the cells were then incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm by using a 96-well multiscanner (MRX Revelation, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Thymidine Incorporation Assay—The cell-proliferative effects of TNF were also monitored by the thymidine incorporation method. Briefly, 1000 cells in 100 μl of medium were cultured in triplicate in 96-well plates with various concentrations of TNF for 48 h at 37 °C. Six hours before the completion of the experiment, cells were pulsed with 0.5 μCi (0.0185 mBq) of [3H]thymidine, and the uptake of [3H]thymidine was monitored with a Matrix-9600 β-counter (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, IL). Annexin V Assay—An early indicator of apoptosis is the rapid translocation and accumulation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine from the cytoplasmic interface to the extracellular surface. This loss of membrane asymmetry can be detected by using the binding properties of annexin V. Therefore, to identify apoptosis, we used the annexin V antibody, which was conjugated with FITC fluorescence dye. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were pretreated with 1 μg/ml cycloheximide, treated with 1 nm TNF for 16 h at 37 °C, and then subjected to annexin V staining. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 100 μl of a binding buffer containing FITC-conjugated anti-annexin V antibody, and then analyzed with flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). We examined the expression of the NQO1 protein in both wild-type (NQO1-WT) and NQO1-deleted murine keratinocytes (NQO1-KO). As expected, NQO1 was expressed in NQO1-WT cells but not in NQO1-deleted cells (Fig. 1A). Further, we examined the expression of TNF receptor (TNFR)-1 and TNFR2 with flow cytometry. No difference was found in the expression of the two types of receptors between the two cell types (Fig. 1B). NQO1 Is Required for TNF-dependent NF-κB Activation—We investigated the effect of NQO1 deletion on TNF-induced NF-κB activation. We treated the cells with TNF for different times, prepared the nuclear extracts, and then analyzed them for NF-κB activation by the EMSA method. As shown in Fig. 1C, TNF stimulated NF-κB activation in a time-dependent manner in NQO1-WT keratinocytes but abrogated its activation in NQO1-KO keratinocytes. Dicoumarol (NQO1-specific Inhibitor) Suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB Activation—Dicoumarol has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of NQO1 (28.Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Talalay P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), so whether dicoumarol inhibition of NQO1 in WT cells also suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB activation was examined. As shown in Fig. 1D, dicoumarol suppressed TNF-induced NF-κB activation, thus indicating that the activity of NQO1 is required for the suppression of NF-κB. NQO1 Wild-type Cells Increase TNF-induced NF-κB Activation in a Dose-dependent Manner—Because the activation of NF-κB by TNF is more robust at higher concentrations (29.Chaturvedi M.M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of NQO1 deletion on the NF-κB activation induced by higher concentrations of TNF. The activation of NF-κB by TNF was strongly evident in NQO1-WT cells but not in NQO1-KO cells, even at a concentration of 10 nm TNF (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that NQO1 is required for TNF-induced NF-κB activation. NQO1 Is Required for NF-κB Activation Induced by LPS, PMA, or CSC—Besides TNF, NF-κB is activated by various carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli through a mechanism that may differ from that of TNF (30.Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 31.Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3389) Google Scholar, 32.Anto R.J. Mukhopadhyay A. Shishodia S. Gairola C.G. Aggarwal B.B. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the role of NQO1 in NF-κB activation induced by LPS, PMA, or CSC. As shown in Fig. 2B, LPS, PMA, and CSC all stimulated NF-κB, and NQO1 deletion suppressed NF-κB activation in every case. These results indicated that NQO1 acts at a step in the NF-κB activation pathway that is common to all these agents. Various combinations of Rel/NF-κB protein can constitute an active NF-κB heterodimer that binds to a specific sequence in the DNA (33.Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). Antibodies to both the p50 (NF-κB1) and the p65 (RelA) subunits of NF-κB shifted the major retarded band visualized by EMSA to a higher molecular mass (Fig. 2C), thus suggesting that the TNF-activated complex consisted of p50 and p65 subunits. The addition of preimmune serum had no effect, and excess unlabeled NF-κB (100-fold) caused complete disappearance of the band; however, a mutant oligonucleotide of NF-κB did not affect NF-κB binding activity. NQO1 Is Required for Expression of TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Expression—DNA binding does not always correlate with NF-κB-dependent gene transcription (34.Nasuhara Y. Adcock I.M. Catley M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19965-19972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). NF-κB-regulated reporter gene expression was activated by TNF in a dose-dependent manner in wild-type keratinocytes, but minimal activation was detected in NQO1-deleted keratinocytes (Fig. 2D). These results suggested that NQO1 is needed not only for p65 binding to DNA but also for NF-κB-regulated reporter gene expression. NQO1 Is Required for TNF-dependent IκBα Degradation—Translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus is preceded by proteolytic degradation of IκBα (33.Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). TNF induced IκBα degradation, and it reached maximum at 15 min after TNF stimulation in wild-type keratinocytes (Fig. 3A). In NQO1-deleted keratinocytes, however, TNF had no effect on IκBα degradation (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Thus, NQO1 is required for degradation of IκBα. NQO1 Is Required for TNF-dependent IκBα Phosphorylation—The proteolytic degradation of IκBα is known to require phosphorylation at serines 32 and 36 (33.Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). TNF stimulated IκBα phosphorylation in wild-type keratinocytes, but in NQO1-KO cells, the IκBα phosphorylation induced by TNF was almost completely suppressed (Fig. 3A, middle panel). NQO1 Deletion Inhibits TNF-induced IKK Activation—Given that IKK is required for TNF-induced NF-κB activation (33.Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of NQO1 deletion on TNF-induced IKK activation. NQO1 deletion completely repressed TNF-induced activation of IKK without any effect on the expression of IKK-α or IKK-β (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that NQO1 is required for TNF-induced IKK activation. NQO1 Is Required for TNF-induced Phosphorylation and Nuclear Translocation of p65—Because the degradation of IκBα leads to nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, we also analyzed the effect of the NQO1 deletion on TNF-induced nuclear translocation of p65 with Western blot analysis. TNF induced nuclear translocation of p65 in a time-dependent manner as early as 5 min after TNF stimulation in NQO1 wild-type keratinocytes (Fig. 3C). In NQO1-deleted keratinocytes, TNF failed to induce nuclear translocation of p65. TNF induces the phosphorylation of p65, which is required for its transcriptional activity (35.Ghosh S. Gifford A.M. Riviere L.R. Tempst P. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, TNF also induced phosphorylation of p65 in a time-dependent manner as early as 5 min after TNF stimulation in NQO1 wild-type keratinocytes. In NQO1-deleted keratinocytes, TNF failed to induce phosphorylation of p65. NQO1 Is Required for TNF-induced Activation of JNK—We investigated the effect of NQO1 on other signals transduced by TNF. Activation of JNK is one of the earliest events induced by TNF (22.Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). To evaluate the specific role of NQO1 on TNF-induced JNK activation, we stimulated cells with TNF for varying time intervals, prepared whole cell extracts, and analyzed them for JNK activity with an immune-complex kinase assay. TNF induced the time-dependent activation of JNK in wild-type but not in NQO1-deleted keratinocytes (Fig. 4A). These results indicated that NQO1 is required for TNF-induced JNK activatio"
https://openalex.org/W2014512153,"The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is an essential component of the body's detoxification system. PXR is activated by a broad spectrum of xenobiotics and endobiotics, including bile acids and their precursors. Bile acids in high concentrations are toxic; therefore, their synthesis is tightly regulated by the farnesoid X receptor, and their catabolism involves several enzymes regulated by PXR. Here we demonstrate that the expression of PXR is regulated by farnesoid X receptor. Feeding mice with cholic acid or the synthetic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist GW4064 resulted in a robust PXR induction. This effect was abolished in FXR knock-out mice. Long time bile acid treatment resulted in an increase of PXR target genes in wild type mice. A region containing four FXR binding sites (IR1) was identified in the mouse Pxr gene. This region was able to trigger an 8-fold induction after GW4064 treatment in transactivation studies. Deletion or mutation of single IR1 sites caused a weakened response. The importance of each individual IR1 element was assessed by cloning a triple or a single copy and was tested in transactivation studies. Two elements were able to trigger a strong response, one a moderate response, and one no response to GW4064 treatment. Mobility shift assays demonstrated that the two stronger responding elements were able to bind FXR protein. This result was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. These results strongly suggest that PXR is regulated by FXR. Bile acids activate FXR, which blocks synthesis of bile acids and also leads to the transcriptional activation of PXR, promoting breakdown of bile acids. The combination of the two mechanisms leads to an efficient protection of the liver against bile acid induced toxicity.

The combination of the two mechanisms leads to an efficient protection of the liver against bile acid induced toxicity. A key function of the liver is the elimination of xenobiotics and endogenous catabolites from the systemic circulation. Although multiple reactions are involved, they generally are divided into three phases, hydroxylation (phase I), conjugation (phase II), and transport (phase III). The expression of many phase I, II, and III genes is regulated by transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor family (1Tirona R.G. Kim R.B. J. Pharm.

One of the best known examples for the function of PXR and CAR is found within the regulation of the CYP3A subfamily of cytochromes P450 (CYPs). CYPs encode broad specificity heme-containing monooxygenases that catalyze the oxidation of a wide variety of structurally dissimilar compounds. In humans, the CYP3A enzymes are responsible for the oxidation of more than 60% of all prescribed drugs as well as many steroids and bile acids. CYP3A4 (Cyp3a11 in mice) expression is strongly activated by both CAR and PXR ligands and reduced in PXR–/– and CAR–/– mice (11Pascussi J.M. Gerbal-Chaloin S. Drocourt L. Maurel P. Vilarem M.J.

Bile acids in high concentrations are toxic; therefore, their metabolism and transport is tightly regulated. One major governor here is the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR), representing the physiological sensor for bile acids (18Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J.

Bile acids like chenodeoxycholic, lithocholic, or deoxycholic acid as well as their taurine and glycine conjugates directly bind to FXR (19Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M.

FXR plays a critical role in the negative feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis. Bile acids activate FXR, which then induces the expression of another nuclear receptor termed small heterodimer partner (SHP). SHP itself initializes a cascade leading to the down-regulation of cholesterol 7α hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) (21Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D.

Additional roles of FXR in bile acid metabolism have been suggested by the observation that the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the transport of bile acids also is regulated by FXR, including for example the bile acid export pump (BSEP) (22Schuetz E.G.

Potentially toxic bile acids and bile acid precursors also can activate PXR and thereby induce cytochromes P450 of the CYP3A subfamily, which catalyze metabolism of bile acids. Furthermore PXR has been implicated in the down-regulation of CYP7A1, the mechanism remaining unknown (14Staudinger J.L. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Hawkins-Brown D. MacKenzie K.I. LaTour A. Liu Y. Klaassen C.D. Brown K.K. Reinhard J. Willson T.M. Koller B.H. Kliewer S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3369-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, 27Owsley E. Chiang J.Y.

Less is known about how PXR itself is regulated. Several studies demonstrated the down-regulation of PXR expression by inflammatory signals as mediated by lipopolysaccharides (30Teng S.

PXR can be induced by dexamethasone through the glucocorticoid receptor in human hepatocytes, whereas PXR activators such as rifampicin and clotrimazole do not affect its expression (33Pascussi J.M. Drocourt L. Fabre J.M. Maurel P. Vilarem M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Whether bile acids play a role in the regulation of PXR has not been investigated so far. Because PXR is an important component of bile acid homeostasis, we investigated if there is a direct connection between PXR and FXR. Animals and Treatment—Wild type and FXR–/– mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room (22–23 °C) under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. The mice were maintained on a low cholesterol (0.02%) chow diet (Purina 5001, Harlan Teklad 75020, Madison, WI) until weeks 9–20 of age. Mice were either treated by oral gavaging with 450 mg of cholic acid/kg of mouse body weight (for the 3-day study fed a 0.2% cholic acid (CA) diet) or 50 mg of the selective synthetic FXR agonist GW4064/kg of mouse body weight or vehicle (polyethylene glycol 400: Tween 80, 4:1, v/v). Before each last treatment mice were fasted for 2 h, then gavaged and sacrificed after two additional hours. For long term treatment mice were fed for 7 days with an experimental diets consisting of the control diet supplemented with 1% (w/w) cholic acid. Tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until further analysis. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee. RNA Extraction and Gene Expression Analysis—RNA extraction from mouse liver was performed using the RNA STAT-60 reagent (TEL-TEST B, Inc., Friendswood, TX) for cells using Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Roche Applied Science) and reverse-transcribed (Superscript II, Invitrogen) using random hexamers (Roche Applied Science) to a final concentration of 20 ng/μl. Gene-specific primers are shown in Table 1. Gene expression was investigated by real time PCR using syber-green incorporation.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used for real time PCR, chimeric plasmid construction and mobility shift assaysTargetForward primer (5′-3′)Reverse primer (5′-3′)Quant-PxrCAAGGCCAATGGCTACCACGGGTGATCTCGCAGGTTQuant-ShpCGATCCTCTTCAACCAGATGAGGGCTCCAAGACTTCACACAQuant-CycloGGAGATGGCACAGGAGGAAGCCCGTAGTGCTTCAGCTTPXR-IntGGTATAGCTTCTTTGTCGACAGCCTGAAGGGTTCCTTACTGTACTTGAGGATCCCAAAGTCCATGCATCTK-3AAGCTGGGCCACTGGCCTTTGTGGGCCACTGGCCTTTGTGGGCCAC TGGCCTGATCAGGCCAGTGGCCCACAAAGGCCAGTGGCCCACAAAGGCCAG TGGCCCTK-3BAGCTAGCTCACTGTGCCTGGCAGCTCACTGTGCCTGGCAGCTCAC TGTGCCGATCGGCACAGTGAGCTGCCAGGCACAGTGAGCTGCCAGGCACAG TGAGCTTK-3CAGCTCGGTCAATGACCGTGTCCGGTCAATGACCGTGCTCGGTCAA TGACCGGATCCGGTCATTGACCGAGCACGGTCATTGACCGGACACGGTCAT TGACCGTK-3DAGCTCGGACACTGACCTGGTGCGGACACTGACCTGGTGCGGACAC TGACCTGATCAGGTCAGTGTCCGCACCAGGTCAGTGTCCGCACCAGGTCAG TGTCCGTK-AAGCTCTGAAGGGCCACTGGCCTTTGTAGATCTACAAAGGCCAGTGGCCCTTCAGTK-CAGCTCCATGCGGTCAATGACCGTGTCTGATCAGACACGGTCATTGACCGCATGGTK-DAGCTATCTGCGGACACTGACCTGGTGGGATCCCACCAGGTCAGTGTCCGCAGAperIR1AGCTGCTTTTAGGTCAATGACCTAGCCCTCGATCGAGGGCTAGGTCATTGACCTAAAAGCmutIR1AGCTGCTTTTAGTGCAATGAATTAGCCCTCGATCGAGGGCTAATTCATTGCACTAAAAGCSDM-ACTGAAGGGTTCTGAAGGTGCACTGGATTTTGTAGAGAGGCAGGCCTGCCTCTCTACAAAATCCAGTGCACCTTCAGAACCCTTCAGSDM-BCCGGACCCGAGACTGAGTGCACTGTATCTGGCAGGCCTGAGCTCGAGCTCAGGCCTGCCAGATACAGTGCACTCAGTCTCGGGTCCGGSDM-CCCACTGTAGCCCATGCGTGCAATGAATGTGTCTCCTGGATTGCAATCCAGGAGACACATTCATTGCACGCATGGGCTACAGTGGSDM-DCAAAGTCAGGGATCTGCGTGCACTGAATTGGTGGTCATAACTCAGCTGAGTTATGACCACCAATTCAGTGCACGCAGATCCCTGACTTTGMS-ACTGAAGGGCCACTGGCCTTTGTATACAAAGGCCAGTGGCCCTTCAGMS-BGACTGAGCTCACTGTGCCTGGCATGCCAGGCACAGTGAGCTCAGTCMS-CCCATGCGGTCAATGACCGTGTCTAGACACGGTCATTGACCGCATGGMS-mutCCCATGCGTGCAATGAATGTGTCTAGACACATTCATTGCACGCATGGMS-DATCTGCGGACACTGACCTGGTGGCCACCAGGTCAGTGTCCGCAMS-perIR1GCTTTTAGGTCAATGACCTAGCCCTCGAGGGCTAGGTCATTGACCTAAAAGCCyp3a11TGTAGATGAACTTCATGAACTGTCTAGCTAGACAGTTCATGAAGTTCATCTACACHIP AGGATGAGGAGGTTGGGAGTTCTGTAG′GGATGGCTGAGCTGTAAAGACTGGCHIP BGGGAAGCTGGCTTGGAAGGATGGGCCACCAGGGGTCTCTTATCCAGCHIP CAGGCTCGTCAGCTCAGGAGATCTCCCAAAGGCACATCAATCCAGGAGACCHIP DCCAAACCTGGGAGAGTTAGCCCCATCCTAGGGAGAGGTGCTCAG′ Open table in a new tab Plasmid Construction—A fragment of the mouse Pxr second intron gene region containing four potential IR1 sites was PCR-amplified using mouse genomic DNA as a template and Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The upstream primer (MoInt-for) contained an internal SalI site, and the downstream primer (Mo-Int-rev) contained an internal BamHI restriction site (Table 1). The resulting PCR product was digested and ligated into TK-Luc that had been predigested with the indicated enzymes. Deletion constructs were generated by restriction digest with HindIII. Chimeric TK-Luc constructs containing a triple or single copy of each individual IR1 element were constructed by ligating dimerized oligonucleotides (Table 1) containing a 5′-HindIII and 3′-BamHI overhang into TK-Luc plasmid predigested with HindIII and BamHI. Sequence identity of all constructs was verified by sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Sigma (Rotkreuz, Switzerland) system. Site-direct Mutagenesis—ABCD-TK-derived constructs containing mutated IR1-A, -C, and -D sites were generated by PCR using complementary oligonucleotides mutated in the IR1 sites (Table 1) and PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The products were digested with DpnI to remove the parental DNA template and selected for constructs containing mutations. The mutated plasmids were termed mABCD-TK, AbmCD-TK, ABCmD-TK, and AbmCmD. Cell Culture and Transfection Studies—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). mhPKT cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 nm dexamethasone (Sigma), 5 mg/ml insulin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). One day before the experiment cells were changed into medium containing 5 or 10% charcoal stripped calf serum, cultivated for 24 h, and then used either for transactivation assays or RNA expression profiling. HEK293 cells were transfected by the CaCl2 precipitation method using 130 ng of plasmid DNA per well composed of 50 ng of luciferase reporter, 20 ng of β-galactosidase expression plasmid, 15 ng of FXR expression plasmid, and 45 ng of pGEM. Eight hours post-transfection cells were treated with 10–6 m GW4064 or Me2SO for 16 h. Transfection experiments were repeated 4–6 times in triplicate. Cells used for real time PCR analysis were treated for 24 h with 10–6 m GW4064 or Me2SO. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Mobility shift assays were preformed either with in vitro translated proteins or nuclear extracts prepared from livers using the CelLytic NuCLEAR Extraction kit (Sigma) as recently described (34Jung D. Hagenbuch B. Gresh L. Pontoglio M. Meier P.J. Kullak-Ublick G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37206-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used in these experiments are shown in Table 1. ChIP Assays were performed in mhPDK cells stimulated with 10–6 m GW4064 for 24 h using a commercial kit (Active Motif Europe, Rixenart, Belgium). Immunoprecipitation was done with 4 mg the antibody FXR C-20 and FXR H130 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). Activated FXR Induces Mouse PXR Expression—To investigate whether there is a cross-talk between FXR and PXR, we analyzed in a first step if PXR is affected by FXR. Wild type and FXR–/– mice were treated with the primary bile acid CA, the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064, or vehicle for 3 days. After sacrifice, mouse liver total RNA was prepared, and expression levels were analyzed by real time PCR. Because Shp is a well described FXR-activated target gene, we first studied changes in Shp gene expression to validate whether our treatment was successful. As expected, an increase in SHP mRNA was observed in wild type mice treated with CA and GW4064 (Fig. 1A). This effect reached significance only in the GW4064-treated mice, however. Induction of Shp gene expression was abolished by deletion of the Fxr gene in the FXR–/– mice; no changes in Shp expression after CA or GW4064 feeding were observed in these mice (Fig. 1A). In a next step we investigated whether PXR is affected by FXR activation or if deletion of the Fxr gene affects basal Pxr gene expression. Whereas FXR–/– mice showed a reduced amount of SHP mRNA as compared with wild type mice, PXR expression did not decrease. However, an induction of PXR mRNA expression was seen in wild type mice after CA and GW4064 treatment for 3 days. As for SHP, this effect only reached significance in the GW4064 treated wild type animals. An increase in PXR expression was not observed in FXR–/– mice, indicating that PXR might be a direct target gene of FXR (Fig. 1B). To exclude that the PXR induction is an indirect effect of long term treatment, mice were additionally treated for 14 h with CA and GW4064. This experiment demonstrated also that short term FXR activation is able to induce PXR in wild type mice, whereas no effect was observed in FXR–/– mice (Fig. 1C). The induction of PXR mRNA due to FXR activation also was observed in the ileum of wild type animals (data not shown). Long Term Exposure to Bile Acids Induces PXR and PXR Target Genes—Because genes important for the detoxification and elimination of bile acids showed only a trend to be increased after feeding CA for 14 h or 3 days (data not shown), we performed long term bile acid treatment. For this propose wild type mice were fed for 7 days with a control diet or a diet supplemented with 1% cholic acid. Again, PXR as well as the FXR target genes Shp and Bsep showed a significant increase in RNA expression (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, PXR target genes known to be involved in bile acid breakdown showed a significant increase in expression when challenged with CA. In particular, an increased expression was detected for the Cyp3a11 and Cyp2b10 as well as for Oatp1a4, Mrp2, and Mdr1α. In contrast, Mdr1β did not show any changes in gene expression (Fig. 2A). In view of the predominant role of PXR as transcriptional activator, we examined its binding to DNA. Therefore, nuclear liver extracts were prepared from mice fed a control diet with (1% CA) or without (con) bile acids and subjected to mobility shift assays for binding to the Cyp3a PXR recognition site (35Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Wade L. Staudinger J.L. Watson M.A. Jones S.A. McKee D.D. Oliver B.B. Willson T.M. Zetterstrom R.H. Perlmann T. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B an enhanced binding was found in mice treated with 1% CA compared with untreated mice. Specificity of the complex (lower arrow) was confirmed by the addition of an RXR-specific antibody, which led to a supershift (upper arrow). Analysis of the Mouse Pxr Gene for FXR Binding Sites—Having shown that the mouse Pxr gene expression is induced by activated FXR, we investigated in a next step whether the Pxr gene contains potential FXR binding sites. Nuclear receptor DNA recognition sites contain consensus hexameric repeat motifs (AGAACA or AGGTCA) that can be organized as direct, everted, or inverted repeats, spaced by a defined number of nucleotides. FXR has been described to bind preferentially to IR1, ER7 (everted repeat 7), and DR4 (direct repeat 4) elements (36Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10638-10647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Using a weighted matrix-based computational approach (NUBIScan) (37Podvinec M. Kaufmann M.R. Handschin C. Meyer U.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we screened in a first round 10 kilobases of the 5′-flanking region including the promoter region for potential FXR bindings sites. No FXR consensus repeat motif was found within this 5′-upstream region; therefore, we continued to analyze all intronic regions of the mouse Pxr gene. As shown in Fig. 3A, a region spanning around 1250 bp that contained four highly conserved inverted hexanucleotide repeats (IR1), termed IR1-A (GGGCCAcTGGCCT), IR1-B (AGCTCAcTGTGCC), IR1-C (CGGTCAaTGACCG), and IR1-D (CGGACAcTGACCT) was identified within the second intron. This region is found at a distance of ∼40 kilobases downstream of the transcriptional start site. Effect of GW4064 on the Pxr Intronic Gene Region—To investigate whether the identified region is able to confer a bile acid response, we cloned the intronic PXR region containing the four highly conserved IR1 sites in front of a thymidine kinase promoter generating TK-ABCD, as shown in Fig. 3A. HEK235 cells cotransfected with FXR were transiently transfected with TK-ABCD and either treated with Me2SO as control or GW4064 as FXR ligand. Activation of FXR by GW4064 treatment resulted in a 7.6-fold increased luciferase activity (Fig. 3B) in TK-ABCD expression compared with Me2SO-treated cells, in contrast to the empty TK-Luc reporter construct which did not confer any response. These data indicate that indeed functional FXR binding sites are located within the proposed region. To evaluate the role of individual IR1 sites, several deletion constructs were generated by restriction digestion as shown in Fig. 2A. Deletion of the elements A and B (TK-CD) reduced activation by GW4064 by 37%, indicating that at least one of the elements (A or B) is able to respond to bile acids. Deletion of element D (TK-ABC) resulted in a massive 69% loss of activation, indicating that this element has a more prominent role than A or B. TK-C, a construct only containing element C (TK-C), also had a strongly reduced activation (65%). These data suggest that elements C and D are the functionally important bile acid response elements within the identified region. The IR1 Binding Sites A, C, and D of the Pxr Gene Confer Activation by GW4064—To assess the importance of each individual IR1 element for the bile acid-dependent activation of PXR, a triple copy of each IR1 was cloned in front of the thymidine kinase promoter of the luciferase gene vector TK-Luc. In transfected HEK235 cells all TK-Luc constructs had similar basal luciferase activities attributable to the TK promoter. Treatment with the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 resulted in a 16.2-fold increase of TK-3A, a 76.7-fold increase of TK-3C, and a 78.3-fold increase of TK-3D luciferase activity. TK-3B, like the native TK-Luc, did not show any response. A control containing three copies of a perfect IR1 showed a 97-fold induction of luciferase activity (Fig. 4A). To further confirm the role of each individual IR1 element in mediating PXR induction by FXR activation, IR1-A, -C, and -D were cloned as a single copy in front of the thymidine kinase promoter of the vector TK-Luc. Additionally two new constructs were generated; TK-per IR1, containing a single perfect IR1 element, and TK-mutIR1, in which the IR1 site was mutated (Fig. 4B). All constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells and treated with Me2SO or GW4064. All three elements of the Pxr gene were able to confer a response after FXR activation. In particular, the single copy IR1-A showed the lowest induction, resulting in a 2.1-fold increased luciferase activity after GW4064 treatment. Similar to this, IR1-D showed a 3.3-fold increase. The highest induction (10-fold) was obtained with element IR1-C. Of note, a perfect single IR1 element (TK-perIR1) was able to produce an 18.9-fold induction of luciferase activity after FXR activation, whereas neither the mutated IR1 (TK-mutIR1) nor the native vector (TK-Luc) showed any response. These data clearly show that elements A, C, and D of the mouse Pxr gene are able to confer activation by GW4064. Mutagenesis of the IR1 Sites Result in a Loss in Induction—To assess the importance of IR1-A, -C, and -D for the bile acid-dependent activation of PXR, mutations were introduced in each individual response element as illustrated in Fig. 5A. Mutation of the IR1-A binding site (TK-mABCD) resulted in a 20% re"
https://openalex.org/W2043535595,"Epithelial cell-cell adhesion is mediated by E-cadherin, an intercellular N-glycoprotein adhesion receptor that functions in the assembly of multiprotein complexes anchored to the actin cytoskeleton named adherens junctions (AJs). E-cadherin ectodomains 4 and 5 contain three potential N-glycan addition sites, although their significance in AJ stability is unclear. Here we show that sparse cells lacking stable AJs produced E-cadherin that was extensively modified with complex N-glycans. In contrast, dense cultures with more stable AJs had scarcely N-glycosylated E-cadherin modified with high mannose/hybrid and limited complex N-glycans. This suggested that variations in AJ stability were accompanied by quantitative and qualitative changes in E-cadherin N-glycosylation. To further examine the role of N-glycans in AJ function, we generated E-cadherin N-glycosylation variants lacking selected N-glycan addition sites. Characterization of these variants in CHO cells, lacking endogenous E-cadherin, revealed that site 1 on ectodomain 4 was modified with a prominent complex N-glycan, site 2 on ectodomain 5 did not have a substantial oligosaccharide, and site 3 on ectodomain 5 was decorated with a high mannose/hybrid N-glycan. Removal of complex N-glycan from ectodomain 4 led to a dramatically increased interaction of E-cadherin-catenin complexes with vinculin and the actin cytoskeleton. The latter effect was further enhanced by the deletion of the high mannose/hybrid N-glycan from site 3. In MDCK cells, which produce E-cadherin, a variant lacking both complex and high mannose/hybrid N-glycans functioned like a dominant positive displaying increased interaction with γ-catenin and vinculin compared with the endogenous E-cadherin. Collectively, our studies show that N-glycans, and complex oligosaccharides in particular, destabilize AJs by affecting their molecular organization."

Recently we reported that the presence of testosterone, rather than the absence of estrogen, plays a critical role in gender differences in kidney susceptibility to I/R injury in mice. Although reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defenses have been implicated in I/R injury, their roles remain to be defined. Here we report that the orchiectomized animal had significantly less lipid peroxidation and lower hydrogen peroxide levels in the kidney 4 and 24 h after 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia when compared with intact or dihydrotestosterone-treated orchiectomized males. The post-ischemic kidney expression and activity of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in orchiectomized mice was much greater than in intact or dihydrotestosterone-administered orchiectomized mice. Four hours after 30 min of bilateral ischemia, superoxide formation was significantly lower in orchiectomized mice than in intact mice. In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, a kidney epithelial cell line, 1 mm H2O2 decreased MnSOD activity, an effect that was potentiated by pretreatment with dihydrotestosterone. Orchiectomy prevented the post-ischemic decrease of catalase activity. Treatment of male mice with manganese(III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (MnTMPyP), a SOD mimetic, reduced the post-ischemic increase of plasma creatinine, lipid peroxidation, and tissue hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest that orchiectomy accelerates the post-ischemic activation of MnSOD and reduces reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, resulting in reduced kidney susceptibility to I/R injury.

Testosterone administration to orchiectomized male or female mice reverses the protective phenotype, increasing susceptibility to kidney I/R injury. We concluded that the presence of testosterone, rather than the absence of estrogen, plays a critical role in the gender differences in kidney susceptibility to I/R injury. The detailed molecular mechanisms responsible for this testosterone effect remain to be defined. Ischemia/reperfusion markedly increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, hypochlorous acid, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite (10.Kaminski K.A.

Base-line oxidation is greater in males than in females (22.Actis-Goretta L. Carrasquedo F. Fraga C.G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2004; 349: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Estrogen has antioxidant properties at pharmacological concentrations, whereas testosterone does not (23.Mooradian A.D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that testosterone may inhibit antioxidant defense systems, resulting in increased susceptibility to kidney I/R injury. Here we report that orchiectomy accelerates the post-ischemic activation and expression of MnSOD in the kidney, leading to reduced superoxide radical levels and lipid peroxidation, effects that can explain the attenuated susceptibility of the kidney of the orchiectomized mouse to ischemic injury. Consistent with this is the finding that manganese(III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (MnTMPyP), a mimic of SOD, reduces kidney susceptibility to I/R injury. Thus, the increase in antioxidant defenses associated with orchiectomy may account for reduced susceptibility to ischemic injury in orchiectomized mice. Animal Preparation—Experiments were performed in 12-14-week-old BALB/c male mice. In all the cases, studies were done according to animal experimental procedures approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyungpook National University. Each animal group consisted of more than four mice. Blood was collected to determine base line plasma creatinine concentrations. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg body weight; intraperitoneally) prior to surgery. Kidney ischemia was carried out as described previously (24.Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 25.Park K.M. Kramers C. Vayssier-Taussat M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol.

In some animals, either orchiectomy or sham orchiectomy was carried out 15 days before either 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia or sham surgery. Some animals were administered dihydroxytestosterone (DHT; 500 μg/kg body weight, Sigma), a non-aromatizible analogue of testosterone or vehicle (sesame oil, Sigma) by subcutaneous injection every day for 14 days prior to ischemia. Some animals were administered intraperitoneally either MnTMPyP (5 mg/kg body weight), a SOD mimetic, or vehicle (saline) for 12 days and then subjected to either 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia or sham operation. Kidneys were harvested for Western blot analysis and biochemical studies and frozen using liquid nitrogen. For the determination of superoxide formation, kidneys were frozen-fixed using oxytetracyline compound (Sakura FineTek, Torrance, CA). Plasma Creatinine Concentration—Seventy microliters of blood was taken from the retrobulbar vein plexus at the times indicated in Figs. 1 and 8. Plasma creatinine concentrations were measured using a Beckman Creatinine Analyzer II (Beckman).FIGURE 8Effect of MnTMPyP on plasma creatinine concentration in mice subjected to ischemia/reperfusion. Some mice were administered MnT-MPyP (5 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline) by intraperitoneal injection daily for 12 days. The mice were subjected to either 30 min of bilateral ischemia or sham operation on day 13. Plasma creatinine concentrations were evaluated 4 and 24 h after reperfusion (n = 4-8). a, p < 0.05 versus sham-operated controls. b, p < 0.05 versus MnTMPyP at 24 h after ischemia.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Measurement of Kidney Lipid Peroxidation and Hydrogen Peroxide—Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were determined as a measure of lipid peroxidation. Samples were evaluated for malondialdehyde (MDA) production using a spectrophotometric assay for thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (26.Lee J.H. Park J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide concentrations were determined using a ferric oxide-sensitive dye, xylenol orange, as described (26.Lee J.H. Park J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). H2O2 oxidizes iron(II) to iron(III) in the presence of sorbitol, which acts as a catalyst. Iron(III) then forms a purple complex with xylenol orange. Preparation of Kidney Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Fractions—Kidneys in sucrose buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) on ice were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used to measure the activity of catalase or copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). The precipitate was washed twice with sucrose buffer to collect mitochondrial pellets. The mitochondrial pellets were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, disrupted twice using a sonicator (4710 series; Cole-Palmer, Chicago, IL) at 40% of maximum setting for 10 s, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used to measure the activities of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Measurement of Catalase, CuZnSOD, and MnSOD Activities in Kidney and MDCK Cells—Catalase activity was measured by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, determined by a decrease in absorbance at 240 nm. SOD activity was assayed spectrophotometrically using a pyrogallol assay as described previously (27.Marklund S. Marklund G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). MnSOD or CuZnSOD activity was measured using the mitochondrial or cytosolic fraction, respectively. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the quantity of enzyme that reduces the superoxide-dependent color change by 50%. MDCK cells were grown in the phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-deprived fetal bovine serum. Cells were pretreated in serum-free medium for 24 h, incubated with serum-free medium containing various concentrations of DHT for 24 h, and treated with either 1 mm H2O2 or vehicle. Immunoblot Analyses—Immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (24.Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 25.Park K.M. Kramers C. Vayssier-Taussat M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol.

Determination of Superoxide Formation Using Nitro Blue Tetrazolium (NBT)—Kidneys were harvested either at 4 h after sham operation or 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia. The kidneys were frozen-fixed in liquid nitrogen and cut into 4-μm sections using a cryomicrotome (Cryotome). Sections were incubated in 1 mg/ml NBT (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 37°C and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Signals were observed using a light microscope. The area of nitro blue tetrazolium positivity was analyzed using the image acquisition and analysis software, LabWorks (Ultra-Violet Products Ltd.). Statistics—The results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences among groups were calculated using analysis of variance followed by least significance difference post hoc comparison using the SPSS 12.0 program. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant at a p value of <0.05. Orchiectomy Reduces Kidney Susceptibility to Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Mice—Thirty minutes of bilateral renal ischemia in intact mice markedly increased the plasma creatinine level at 4 and 24 h after reperfusion (Fig. 1). By contrast, this period of ischemia in orchiectomized mice did not result in the increase of plasma creatinine 4 and 24 h after ischemia (Fig. 1). To determine whether the reduced susceptibility of orchiectomized mice to ischemia is associated with testosterone, we induced ischemia in orchiectomized mice that had been pretreated with DHT. In these mice, post-ischemic plasma creatinine levels were similar to those in intact males (Fig. 1). Ischemia/Reperfusion-induced Kidney Lipid Peroxidation and Production of Hydrogen Peroxide Were Reduced in Orchiectomized Mice—Thirty minutes of bilateral renal ischemia followed by 4 or 24 h reperfusion significantly increased lipid peroxidation and tissue hydrogen peroxide levels (Fig. 2A). The lipid peroxidation in intact males was much greater than in orchiectomized males 4 and 24 h after I/R (Fig. 2A). Tissue hydrogen peroxide levels were significantly lower in orchiectomized mice when compared with that in intact mice 4 and 24 h after I/R (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the reduced susceptibility to I/R injury in orchiectomized mice may be related to a reduction of ROS. Activity of Catalase in Kidneys Subjected to Ischemia/Reperfusion—In intact males, 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia significantly decreased the kidney catalase activity 24 h after reperfusion, whereas in orchiectomized mice it did not (Fig. 3). To examine whether the reduced activity of catalase in intact males is associated with the levels of androgen, we determined the post-ischemic catalase activity in orchiectomized mice administered 500 μg/kg DHT. Twenty-four hours after ischemia, catalase activities in DHT-treated orchiectomized mice were significantly lower than sham-operated control (Fig. 3). We reported previously that orchiectomy decreases plasma testosterone, and DHT treatment increases plasma testosterone levels to those of the intact male (8.Park K.M. Kim J.I. Ahn Y. Bonventre A.J. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52282-52292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Activity of CuZnSOD and MnSOD in Kidneys Subjected to Ischemia—Four and 24 h after ischemia, the activity of CuZn-SOD in the cytosolic fraction of kidney tissues was not significantly changed in any of the three experimental animal groups when compared with their respective sham-operated control mice (Fig. 4A). Because MnSOD is a major antioxidant in mitochondria and is essential for life (28.Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Nat.

A. 1996; 93: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), we determined the activity of MnSOD in the mitochondrial fraction of the kidneys. In intact males, ischemia significantly decreased MnSOD activity 24 h after ischemia (Fig. 4B). In orchiectomized males, however, ischemia did not attenuate the activity of MnSOD 24 h after reperfusion (Fig. 4B). In fact, MnSOD activity was increased 4 h after ischemia in orchiectomized males (Fig. 4B). Administration of DHT to orchiectomized mice prevented the increase (Fig. 4B). The increased MnSOD activity in orchiectomized mice was associated with an increase in total MnSOD protein in kidneys 4 h after reperfusion (Fig. 5). By contrast, ischemia in intact mice and in orchiectomized mice treated with DHT did not result in the change of MnSOD expression (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Effect of hormonal modification on MnSOD expression in the kidney after ischemia. Some mice were subjected to orchiectomy on day 0. Some mice were administered DHT (500 μg/kg body weight) or vehicle (sesame oil) by subcutaneous injection daily for 14 days. BALB/c mice were subjected to either sham operation (S) or 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia (I)on day 15. Four hours after reperfusion, the expression of MnSOD in the mitochondrial fraction was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The blot is representative of three independent experiments. The density of Western blot bands was quantified by NIH Image program. Values presented are -fold increases versus sham in intact/vehicle-treated mice. The results are presented as mean ± S.E. a, p < 0.05 versus sham-operated controls. b and c, p < 0.05 versus ischemia in intact and orchiectomy/DHT groups, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activity and Expression of MnSOD in MDCK Cells after Treatment with DHT or H2O2—Because epithelial cell injury is an important component of ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury in vivo, we determined the effect of DHT on the activity and expression of MnSOD in MDCK cells, an established kidney epithelial cell line. Treatment with DHT alone did not alter MnSOD expression and activity (Fig. 6A). One mm H2O2 treatment significantly decreased MnSOD activity in the mitochondrial fraction of the cells (Fig. 6B). Pretreatment with DHT resulted in significantly greater reductions in MnSOD activity after treatment with 1 mm H2O2 (Fig. 6B). Orchiectomy Reduces Post-ischemic Superoxide Formation in the Kidneys Subjected to Ischemia—Because superoxide produces blue formazan after reaction with nitro blue tetrazolium, we examined the deposition of blue formazan in kidney sections. Four hours after I/R, the formation of blue formazan dramatically increased in the tubular cells of the kidneys in intact mice (Fig. 7A). Superoxide formation was less in orchiectomized mice than it is in intact mice 4 h after I/R (Fig. 7A). The production of formazan was quantitated, and data are presented in Fig. 7B. This suggests that the higher activity of antioxidant enzymes such as MnSOD in orchiectomized mice reduces the amount of superoxide radicals leading to less susceptibility of the kidney to I/R injury. MnTMPyP, a SOD Mimetic, Reduces Post-ischemic Lipid Peroxidation and Protects the Kidney from Ischemia—To determine whether the increased activation of MnSOD mediates the lower susceptibility of orchiectomized males to ischemia, we examined the effect of MnTMPyP, a mimetic of SOD, on I/R injury. Treatment with MnTMPyP for 12 days did not change body weight (data not shown). At 24 h after ischemia, plasma creatinine concentration significantly increased in vehicle-treated mice, whereas ischemia resulted in only modest increases in MnTMPyP-treated mice (Fig. 8). To examine whether the protection afforded by MnTMPyP was associated with reduced oxidative stress, we determined the lipid peroxidation and the tissue hydrogen peroxide levels in the kidney 4 and 24 h after reperfusion. Prior administration of MnTMPyP resulted in significant reductions in post-ischemic lipid peroxidation and tissue hydrogen peroxide levels when compared with vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 9). Catalase activity was not affected by MnTMPyP administration and decreases 24 h after ischemia in both vehicle- and MnTMPyP-treated mice (Fig. 10A). Pretreatment with MnTMPyP did not affect the activities of CuZnSOD 4 and 24 h after ischemia (Fig. 10B). MnTMPyP prevented the post-ischemic reduction of MnSOD activity (Fig. 10C).FIGURE 10Effect of MnTMPyP on the post-ischemic activities of catalase (A), CuZnSOD (B), and MnSOD (C) in kidneys. Some mice were subjected to orchiectomy on day 0. Mice were administered either MnTMPyP (5 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline) by intraperitoneal injection daily for 12 days. They were then subjected to either 30 min of bilateral ischemia or sham operation on day 13. Four and 24 h after reperfusion, catalase (A) and CuZnSOD (B) activity in the cytosolic fraction of the kidneys and MnSOD activity in the mitochondrial fraction (C) were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values presented are -fold increases relative to sham vehicle group. The results are presented as mean ± S.E. (n = 4-8). Catalase, CuZn-SOD, and MnSOD activities in sham vehicle groups were 24.51 ± 1.42 units/mg of protein, 7.04 ± 0.58 units/mg of protein, and 6.33 ± 0.41 units/mg of protein, respectively. a, p < 0.05 versus their respective sham-operated controls. b, p < 0.05 versus MnTMPyP at their respective times after ischemia.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our findings build on our previous data that removal of the testes in males reduces kidney susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion injury and that the reduced susceptibility associated with orchiectomy is reversed by addition of exogenous testosterone. We have now found a mechanism of this important gender difference in susceptibility to ischemia. The protection afforded by orchiectomy is related to a reduction of oxidative stress as reflected by reduced lipid peroxidation and reduced tissue levels of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide formation with greater MnSOD activity in the kidneys of orchiectomized mice. We also demonstrate that MnTMPyP, a SOD mimetic, reduces the post-ischemic lipid peroxidation and renal functional impairment in mice. Although many studies have emphasized the beneficial effect of estrogen in gender differences in ischemia/reperfusion injury, this study, together with our prior observations, demonstrates that male sex hormones play an important role in the gender difference in kidney susceptibility to I/R injury (8.Park K.M.

In postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease, testosterone concentration and MDA production, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, are elevated in serum when compared with values obtained in normal healthy women (34.Deng H. Zhou H. Sun M. Hunan Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 1999; 24: 343-346PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, SOD and estradiol levels are significantly lower than in normal healthy women (34.Deng H. Zhou H.

Lipid peroxidation and production of ROS are regulated by various extracellular and intracellular antioxidant enzymes. A contributing factor to the increase of ROS levels after I/R is the reduction of antioxidant enzyme activity. It has been reported that catalase activity is decreased after I/R (11.Dobashi K. Ghosh B. Orak J.K. Singh I. Singh A.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 205: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the activity of catalase, which transforms H2O2 to H2O, was significantly decreased after ischemia in the intact mice, whereas orchiectomy prevented the post-ischemic decreases of catalase activity. In addition, DHT administration to orchiectomized mice prevented the effects of orchiectomy on the post-ischemic decrease of catalase activity, indicating that testosterone plays an important role in the regulation of antioxidant enzyme activity. H2O2 production was greater in intact males than in orchiectomized mice. Superoxide is an important free radical mediating cellular damage. It is scavenged by CuZnSOD located in cytoplasm and MnSOD in mitochondria. MnSOD is the major antioxidant enzyme located in mitochondria and is essential for life (28.Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J.

Macmillan-Crow and Cruthirds (35.Macmillan-Crow L.A. Cruthirds D.L. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) reported that mice expressing only 50% of the normal complement of MnSOD demonstrate increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and severe mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from elevation of ROS (35.Macmillan-Crow L.A. Cruthirds D.L. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of MnSOD enzyme renders the cell and tissues resistant to ischemia/reperfusion injury (36.Chen Z. Siu B. Ho Y.S. Vincent R. Chua C.C. Hamdy R.C. Chua B.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 2281-2289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In the present study, orchiectomy resulted in enhanced post-ischemic MnSOD, but not CuZnSOD, activity and expression, resulting in the reduction of post-ischemia superoxide radical formation. Thus the higher ROS stress in intact males may be directly related to lower MnSOD activity (37.Chien C.T. Lee P.H. Chen C.F. Ma M.C. Lai M.K. Hsu S.M. J. Am. Soc.

To test whether testosterone alone suppresses the expression and activity of MnSOD by a direct effect on the epithelial cell, we evaluated whether DHT modulates MnSOD activity and expression in MDCK cells, a well established tubular epithelial cell line. DHT treatment alone did not affect the expression and activity of MnSOD in these cells. Thirty or sixty minutes after treatment with 1 mm H2O2, however, MnSOD activity was significantly lower in DHT-pretreated MDCK cells than that in vehicle-pretreated cells (Fig. 6B). This indicates that the postischemic suppression of MnSOD activity in DHT-treated orchiectomized mice may reflect, at least in part, a direct effect on the epithelial cell. MnSOD is susceptible to nitrotyrosylation, which resulted in enzyme inactivation (38.MacMillan-Crow L.A. Cruthirds D.L. Ahki K.M. Sanders P.W. Thompson J.A. Free Radic. Biol.

We speculate therefore that MnSOD is inactivated by nitration. MacMillan-Crow et al. (38.MacMillan-Crow L.A. Cruthirds D.L. Ahki K.M. Sanders P.W. Thompson J.A. Free Radic. Biol.

Biophys. 2003; 412: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) reported that I/R in kidney decreases MnSOD activity without a reduction in MnSOD expression, and this decrease of MnSOD activity is associated with an increase in MnSOD nitration. Sam et al. (41.Sam F. Kerstetter D.L. Pimental D.R. Mulukutla S. Tabaee A. Bristow M.R. Colucci W.S. Sawyer D.B. J. Card.

ROS production by mitochondria from females is much lower than that from males (18.Borras C. Sastre J. Garcia-Sala D. Lloret A. Pallardo F.V. Vina J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), indicating that levels of sexual hormones affect SOD activity. In the present study, although the treatment of orchiectomized mice with DHT restored kidney susceptibility from a resistant to susceptible phenotype, the post-ischemic reduction of MnSOD activity was not restored. This may be caused by subtle differences of hormone levels between intact and DHT-treated orchiectomized mice. Thirty minutes of bilateral ischemia in non-orchiectomized mice results in the disruption of most of tubular cells in the outer medulla leading to kidney dysfunction (8.Park K.M. Kim J.I. Ahn Y.

In the present study, 30 min of ischemia in orchiectomized mice produced small amounts of free radicals as seen in Fig. 7 without extensive tubular cell death, lipid peroxidation, and kidney functional impairment (8.Park K.M.

Orchiectomy alone did not modulate superoxide formation. Differences in oxidants and antioxidant enzymes related to orchiectomy only emerged after an ischemic challenge. MnTMPyP is a SOD mimetic that protects the heart from ischemia/reperfusion injury (31.Jain M. Cui L. Brenner D.A. Wang B. Handy D.E. Leopold J.A. Loscalzo J. Apstein C.S. Liao R. Circulation. 2004; 109: 898-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the present study, MnT-MPyP reduced the post-ischemic lipid peroxidation and the tissue levels of hydrogen peroxide in the kidney. These results support the hypothesis that the increased MnSOD activity in orchiectomized mice may account for the reduced susceptibility associated with orchiectomy. Recently we also reported that MnTMPyP protects cells from oxidative stress associated with radiation (26.Lee J.H. Park J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In summary, our data indicate that removal of testes reduces kidney susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion injury and results in decreased lipid peroxidation, increased post-ischemic catalase, and MnSOD activities. The higher activity of antioxidant enzymes may account for the lower susceptibility of orchiectomized mice to ischemic injury. Our findings may have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of gender differences in kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury and should lead to consideration of androgens and the ROS-antioxidant systems as targets for protective strategies to avoid acute kidney injury."
https://openalex.org/W1990530668,"To determine whether integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences could lead to the deregulation of genes implied in oncogenesis, we analysed the HPV integration sites in a series of nine cell lines derived from invasive genital carcinomas. Using in situ hybridization, HPV16 or 18 sequences were found at chromosome band 8q24, the localization of MYC, in IC1, IC2, IC3, IC6 and CAC-1 cells and at other sites in IC4, IC5, IC7 and IC8 cells. We then localized viral sequences at the molecular level and searched for alterations of MYC structure and expression in these cells. MYC genomic status and viral integration sites were also analysed in primary tumors from which IC1, IC2, IC3 and IC6 cells were derived. In IC1, IC2 and CAC-1 cells, HPV DNA was located within 58 kb of MYC, downstream, upstream, or within MYC. In IC3 and IC6 cells, HPV DNA was located 400–500 kb upstream of MYC. Amplification studies showed that, in IC1, IC2 and IC3, viral and MYC sequences were co-amplified in an amplicon between less than 50 and 800 kb in size. MYC amplification was also observed in primary tumors, indicating that this genetic alteration, together with viral insertion at the MYC locus, had already taken place in vivo. MYC was not amplified in the other cell lines. MYC mRNA and protein overexpression was observed in the five cell lines in which the HPV DNA was inserted close to the MYC locus, but in none of the lines where the insertion had occurred at other sites. MYC activation, triggered by the insertion of HPV DNA sequences, can be an important genetic event in cervical oncogenesis."

These results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for targeting compounds within the bacterial metabolome to assign function to genes, identify metabolic intermediates, and elucidate novel biosynthetic pathways. The availability of bacterial genomic sequences has provided unprecedented opportunity for comparative studies. The functional analysis of each respective genome is currently under way and often involves an integrative, multidisciplinary approach that combines bioinformatics, mutagenesis, proteomics, and microarray technologies. Most recently, metabolomics-based analyses, although limited in their number, are becoming established as an additional tool to elucidate gene function (1Weckwerth W. Morgenthal K. Drug Discov.

Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 669-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), such an undertaking still presents numerous technological challenges due to the complexity of the metabolome. Therefore, to facilitate the elucidation of unknown intermediates involved in novel biosynthetic pathways, we felt it might be more useful to employ a focused approach to simplify the metabolite pool and target relevant compounds. Glycosylation of prokaryotic proteins in both N- and O-linkage with novel glycan components is now well established (3Benz I. Schmidt M.A. Mol.

Campylobacter jejuni is unique in having both a general protein glycosylation pathway that is responsible for the N-linked addition of a heptasaccharide containing N-acetylgalactosamine, glucose, and 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-α-d-glucopyranose (2,4-diacetamido-Bac) to at least 30 different proteins as well as an O-linked system, which is responsible for glycosylation of the flagellin structural protein at up to 19 sites per monomer with the novel 9 carbon sialic acid-like sugar 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-α-l-manno-nonulosonic acid (Pse5NAc7NAc) and related derivatives including an acetamidino derivative, PseAm (6Young N.M.

Each of these systems is represented by a distinct and dedicated genetic locus that contains a number of biosynthetic genes. The functional characterization of the protein glycosylation N-linked locus has revealed that the process shows considerable homology to the eukaryotic N-linked system (8Glover K.J. Weerapana E.

Although the specific mechanism of the flagellar O-linked process is currently poorly described, the functional characterization of the biosynthetic pathway enzymes responsible for the production of Pse5NAc7NAc and related derivatives has recently received attention (13Schoenhofen I.C.

It is believed that agents which interfere with the flagellin glycosylation process and inhibit infection would offer tremendous therapeutic potential even if these agents were not detrimental to the bacteria (19Alksne L.E. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 11: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Kauppi A.M. Nordfelth R. Uvell H. Wolf-Watz H. Elofsson M. Chem. Biol.

Thus, the detailed characterization of the genetic locus as well as the elucidation of flagellar glycan biosynthetic pathways is of great significance. Recently, the entire flagellin glycosylation locus of 26 genes from C. jejuni 81–176 was characterized (10Guerry P. Ewing C.P. Schirm M. Lorenzo M. Kelly J. Pattarini D. Majam G. Thibault P. Logan S. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis revealed that a total of nine genes from the locus were involved in flagellin glycosylation, seven of which resulted in a non motile phenotype (pseB, pseC, pseE, pseF, pseG, pseH, and pseI). In addition, mutation of two other genes (pseA and pseD) resulted in flagellin glycosylated with Pse5NAc7NAc but lacking PseAm. Although this study demonstrated a role for several genes in the biosynthesis or transfer of the Pse5NAc7NAc/PseAm moiety, the precise function of these genes remains to be elucidated. In earlier work we had developed a focused metabolomics approach to examine sugar-nucleotide metabolites related to pseudaminic acid biosynthesis within the metabolome of Helicobacter pylori and C. jejuni (15Schirm M.

Using CE-ESMS and precursor ion scanning for fragment ions characteristic of CMP, we were able to identify CMP-Pse5NAc7NAc and CMP-PseAm as nucleotide-activated precursors related to the biosynthesis of Pse5NAc7NAc and PseAm in C. jejuni 81–176 (21Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Logan S.M. Guerry P. Kelly J.F. Young N.M. Thibault P. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, during precursor ion scanning for fragment ions characteristic of the UDP carrier, the accumulation of UDP-linked mono- and diacetamido trideoxyhexose intermediates was observed in two defined mutants, pseF (Cj1311) and pseI (Cj1317), which clearly implicated these two proteins in the Pse5NAc7NAc biosynthetic pathway. In this study we expand this work by including all the mutants described by Guerry et al. (10Guerry P. Ewing C.P. Schirm M. Lorenzo M. Kelly J. Pattarini D. Majam G. Thibault P. Logan S. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) to provide new data on the role of these genes in the Pse5NAc7NAc and PseAm pathways. The metabolomes of the C. jejuni 81–176 wild-type strain and isogenic mutants were probed for nucleotide-activated monosaccharides relevant to Pse5NAc7NAc/PseAm biosynthesis using the CE-ESMS and precursor ion scanning approach. Next, nucleotide-activated metabolites of interest were purified from cell lysates using a novel hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-MS method. The identities of HILIC-MS-purified metabolites were then determined with NMR at 600 MHz (1H) equipped with a cryogenically cooled probe (cold probe) for maximal sensitivity.

Open table in a new tab Materials and Reagents—The sugar-nucleotide standards used for HILIC-MS method development consisted of UDP-α-d-Glc and UDP-α-d-GalNAc (both obtained from Sigma-Aldrich) and CMP-β-d-Neu5Ac, GDP-α-d-Man, and ADP-Glc (purchased from Calbiochem). Intracellular sugar-nucleotides were extracted from the cell lysates using ENVI-Carb (12 ml, 1 g) solid phase extraction cartridges from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). HILIC separations were performed on a TSK-gel Amide-80 column (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter) obtained from Tosoh Bioscience (Montgomeryville, PA). High performance liquid chromatography grade acetonitrile and methanol were from Fisher, whereas 1 m triethylammonium acetate (TEAA), trifluoroacetic acid, ammonium acetate, morpholine, ammonium hydroxide, and acetic acid were from Sigma-Aldrich. De-ionized water was obtained from a MilliQ system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For CE-ESMS experiments bare fused-silica capillaries (100 cm × 50 μm inner diameter) were purchased from Polymicro Technologies (Tucson, AZ). Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Upon re-suspension in a minimum amount of ammonium bicarbonate (50 mm; pH 8.0), cells were lysed using BugBuster (Novagen, Madison, WI), and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 45 min). Ice-cold ethanol was added to the lysates to a final concentration of 60%, and the insoluble material was removed by a second centrifugation. The cell lysates were then evaporated to dryness on a SpeedVac SC110A concentrator (ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY), reconstituted in de-ionized water, and filtered through Amicon 10-kDa cut-off cellulose membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for further analysis. Extraction of Intracellular Sugar-nucleotides from C. jejuni— Solidphase extraction (SPE) is one of the most effective methods for the cleanup of biological samples and the extraction of trace-level analytes from complex biological matrices. However, nucleotide-activated sugars are highly polar molecules and, therefore, have limited affinity toward reverse-phase sorbents such as C18 and C8, which are typically found in SPE materials. Recently, Räbinä et al. (22Räbinä J. Mäki M. Savilahti E.M. Järvinen N. Penttilä L. Renkonen R. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported impressive recoveries of sugar-nucleotides from yeast and bacterial cells using graphitized non-porous carbon SPE material along with the ion-pairing reagent, triethylammonium acetate, in the elution solvent. Subsequent ion-pairing LC experiments permitted separation of intracellular sugar-nucleotides, and their identification was possible by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS (22Räbinä J. Mäki M. Savilahti E.M. Järvinen N. Penttilä L. Renkonen R. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Using commercially available ENVI-Carb SPE cartridges, intracellular sugar-nucleotides were extracted from the cell lysates of C. jejuni 81–176 and the isogenic mutant pseC using an optimized SPE method based on that of Räbinä et al. (22Räbinä J. Mäki M. Savilahti E.M. Järvinen N. Penttilä L. Renkonen R. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ENVI-Carb solid-phase extraction cartridges were activated using 6 ml of acetonitrile-trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) (80–20, v/v) followed by 4 ml of de-ionized water. Cell lysates (2 ml) were loaded on the ENVI-Carb cartridges and washed with 4 ml of water, 4 ml of 5% acetonitrile, and finally with 4 ml of triethylammonium acetate (10 mm; pH 7.0). Elution of intracellular sugar-nucleotides from the ENVI-Carb cartridges was achieved using 2 × 4 ml of acetonitrile-TEAA (25 mm; pH 7.0) (35–65 v/v). The extracts were evaporated to dryness on a SpeedVac concentrator to remove the TEAA and reconstituted in either de-ionized water for CE-ESMS analysis or acetonitrile-ammonium acetate (6.5 mm; pH 5.5) (70–30, v/v) for HILIC-MS. Ten-liter cultures of pseC and C. jejuni 81–176 were necessary to provide sufficient amounts of purified UDP-diacetamido-trideoxyhexose and CMP-PseAm for NMR analyses. CE-ESMS and precursor ion scanning for fragment ions related to UDP (m/z 323, 385, and 403) or CMP (m/z 322) were used as a rapid means to monitor the wash fractions of the SPE procedure for the loss of the metabolites and the presence of the metabolites in the elution steps. An 85% recovery was observed for the extraction procedure. CE-ESMS and HILIC-MS—Cell lysates from wild-type and isogenic mutants of C. jejuni 81–176 were probed for intracellular sugar-nucleotide intermediates using a CE-ESMS and precursor ion scanning method described earlier (21Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Logan S.M. Guerry P. Kelly J.F. Young N.M. Thibault P. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The CE-MS instrumentation consisted of an Agilent CE system coupled to a 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer equipped with a TurboV source via coaxial sheath flow interface (AB/Sciex, Concord, Canada). For the HILIC-MS experiments an Agilent 1100 Series LC system was coupled to the 4000 QTRAP. Mobile phases based on acetonitrile and ammonium acetate were delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 ml·min–1.5-μl injections were used during method development, and this was increased to 10 μl for sample fraction collection. Except for the precursor ion scans, all MS, MS/MS, and MS3 acquisitions were performed using the linear ion trap (LIT)-mode operating at a scan rate of 1000 a.m.u./s in negative mode and using a typical fixed LIT fill time of 20 ms. A collision energy in the range of 35–45 eV (laboratory frame of reference) was employed for MS/MS, whereas a fragmentation time of 100 ms and an excitation frequency of 150 was used for MS3. Analyst 1.4.1 software (AB/MDS Sciex) was used for data acquisition and processing. NMR Spectroscopy of Purified Metabolites—Metabolites were lyophilized, resuspended in 200 μl of 99% D2O (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories Inc., Andover, MA), and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. To observe exchangeable N-H protons, CMP-PseAm samples were suspended in 95% H2O (5% D2O), and the pH was lowered through the addition of dilute DCl to reduce the rate of proton exchange, pH 3.5. All samples were analyzed in 3 mm NMR tubes. Standard homo- and heteronuclear correlated two-dimensional 1H NMR, 31P NMR, 13C HSQC, 31P HSQC, HMBC, COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY pulse sequences from Varian (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) were used for general assignments. Selective one-dimensional TOCSY experiments with a Z-filter and one-dimensional NOESY experiments were used for complete residue assignments and measurement of proton coupling constants (JH,H) and nuclear Overhauser effects (23Brisson J.R. Sue S.C. Wu W.G. McManus G. Nghia P.T. Uhrin D. Jimenez-Barbero J. Peters T. NMR Spectroscopy of Glycoconjugates. 2002: 59-93Google Scholar, 24Uhrin D. Brisson J.R. Barbotin J.N. Portais J.C. NMR in Microbiology: Theory and Applications. 2000: 165-190Google Scholar). NMR experiments were performed with a Varian 600 MHz (1H) spectrometer equipped with a Varian 5-mm Z-gradient triple resonance (1H, 13C, 15N) cryogenically cooled probe (cold probe) and with a Varian Inova 500 MHz (1H) spectrometer with a Varian Z-gradient 3-mm triple resonance (1H, 13C, 31P) probe. NMR experiments were typically performed at 25 °C with suppression of the H2O or HOD resonance at 4.78 ppm. For proton and carbon experiments, the methyl resonance of acetone was used as an internal reference (δH 2.225 ppm and δC 31.07 ppm). Lysates from 15 mutants in the flagellin glycosylation locus of strain 81–176 were compared with the wild-type by CE-ESMS for sugar nucleotide intermediates of the Pse5NAc7NAc/PseAm biosynthetic pathway. This included seven non-motile mutants, three of which encode enzymes in the Pse biosynthetic pathway (pseB, pseC, and pseI) (13Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D. Young N.M.

Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Austin J. Thibault P. Logan S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1579-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Two mutants were included that were motile but produced flagellin modified by Pse5NAc7NAc but lacking PseAm (pseA and pseD), and the remaining six mutants were fully motile with no changes in flagellin glycosylation as detected by isoelectric focusing gels (10Guerry P. Ewing C.P. Schirm M. Lorenzo M. Kelly J. Pattarini D. Majam G. Thibault P. Logan S. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). CE-ESMS results indicated that CMP-Pse5NAc7NAc and CMP-PseAm intermediates were detected in wild-type 81–176, as previously reported (21Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Logan S.M. Guerry P. Kelly J.F. Young N.M. Thibault P. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a; Table 1). The first two enzymatic steps of Pse5NAc7NAc synthesis are encoded by pseB and pseC (13Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D. Young N.M. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), as summarized in Fig. 2. A novel UDP-sugar intermediate was observed in the pseC mutant (m/z 631) (Fig. 1b), and tandem mass spectrometry experiments performed as in previous studies (21Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Logan S.M. Guerry P. Kelly J.F. Young N.M. Thibault P. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) revealed an oxonium ion corresponding to the sugar moiety at m/z 229 (data not shown), but no intermediates were observed in the pseB mutant. Mutants in the genes encoding the two remaining known enzymes in the Pse5NAc7NAc pathway (PseI and PseF) accumulated UDP-229 and UDP-187 intermediates, as did mutants in pseG and pseH, suggesting that they may encode the two missing enzymatic steps (Fig. 2). The final non-motile mutant (pseE) did not accumulate any detectable novel intermediates, and in comparable fashion to the parent strain both CMP-Pse5NAc7NAc and CMP-PseAm were present. This suggests that the pseE gene product is not involved in biosynthesis of either of the CMP-activated sugars but may be involved in either transfer of the glycan moieties to the flagellin protein or at a later stage of the assembly process.FIGURE 2Hypothetical biosynthetic pathways for CMP-pseudaminic acid (I) and UDP-6-deoxy-α-d-GlcNAc4NAc (II, UDP-2,4-diacetamido-bac).

This protein provides the molecular basis for outer hair cell somatic electromotility, which is crucial for the frequency selectivity and sensitivity of mammalian hearing. It has long been known that there are abundantly expressed ∼11-nm protein particles present in the basolateral membrane. These particles were hypothesized to be the motor proteins that drive electromotility. Because the calculated size of a prestin monomer is too small to form an ∼11-nm particle, the possibility of prestin oligomerization was examined. We investigated possible quaternary structures of prestin by lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE, perfluoro-octanoate-PAGE, a membrane-based yeast two-hybrid system, and chemical cross-linking experiments. Prestin, obtained from different host or native cells, is resistant to dissociation by lithium dodecyl sulfate and behaves as a stable oligomer on lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. In the membrane-based yeast two-hybrid system, homo-oligomeric interactions between prestin-bait/prestin-prey suggest that prestin molecules can associate with each other. Chemical cross-linking experiments, perfluoro-octanoate-PAGE/Western blot, and affinity purification experiments all indicate that prestin exists as a higher order oligomer, such as a tetramer, in prestin-expressing yeast, mammalian cell lines and native outer hair cells. Our data from experiments using hydrophobic and hydrophilic reducing reagents suggest that the prestin dimer is connected by a disulfide bond embedded in the prestin hydrophobic core.

Hearing impairment, the most common congenital sensory defect, affects millions of people from newborns to senior citizens, resulting in large hearing-related health care costs (1.Hudspeth A.J.

These sensory receptor cells, located in the mammalian organ of Corti, rapidly change their length (2.Brownell W.E. Bader C.R. Bertrand D. de Ribaupierre Y. Science. 1985; 227: 194-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar) and stiffness (3.He D.Z. Dallos P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8223-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) at acoustic frequencies when their transmembrane voltage is altered. Corresponding to this somatic cell-length change, OHCs exhibit voltage-dependent non-linear capacitance (4.Ashmore, J. F. (1990) Neurosci. Res. Suppl., S39–S50Google Scholar). This unique somatic electromotility is thought to provide active mechanical amplification of the cochlear response to sound (5.Dallos P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has long been known that large (∼11-nm diameter) membrane protein particles constitute a substantial portion of the lateral membrane in OHCs (6.Gulley R.L. Reese T.S. Anat. Rec. 1977; 189: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is suspected that these abundantly expressed particles are the “motor proteins” responsible for somatic electromotility (7.Kalinec F. Holley M.C. Iwasa K.H. Lim D.J. Kachar B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nature. 2000; 405: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), is located at the same location where the 11-nm protein particles are found, i.e. in the lateral membrane of OHCs (9.Belyantseva I.A.

When prestin is heterologously expressed in several mammalian cell lines, the prestin-expressing cells demonstrate all of the characteristics that are unique to OHCs; that is, voltage-driven non-linear capacitance and shape changes (8.Zheng J. Shen W. He D.Z. Long K.B. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Nature. 2000; 405: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), electro-mechanical reciprocality (12.Ludwig J. Oliver D. Frank G. Klocker N.

Such electromotile responses in prestin-transfected cells can also be blocked by salicylate (14.Oliver D. He D.Z. Klocker N. Ludwig J. Schulte U. Waldegger S. Ruppersberg J.P. Dallos P. Fakler B. Science. 2001; 292: 2340-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of electromotility in OHCs (15.Shehata W.E. Brownell W.E. Dieler R.

In addition, OHCs from prestin knock-out (KO) mice do not have somatic electromotility (18.Liberman M.C. Gao J. He D.Z. Wu X. Jia S. Zuo J. Nature. 2002; 419: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Prestin KO mice also lose frequency selectivity and have a 40–60-db reduction in sensitivity (19.Cheatham M.A. Huynh K.H. Gao J. Zuo J. Dallos P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 560: 821-830Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In humans mutations in the Prestin gene are also known to cause hearing impairment (20.Liu X.Z. Ouyang X.M. Xia X.J. Zheng J. Pandya A. Li F. Du L.L. Welch K.O. Petit C. Smith R.J. Webb B.T. Yan D. Arnos K.S. Corey D. Dallos P. Nance W.E. Chen Z.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Prestin is a glycoprotein (21.Matsuda K. Zheng J. Du G.G. Klocker N. Madison L.D. Dallos P. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 928-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) belonging to the anion transport family called solute carrier 26 (SLC26) (22.Mount D.B. Romero M.F. P fluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Several members of this family, including prestin, are involved in human diseases including deafness, Pendred syndrome, congenital chloride diarrhea, diastrophic dysplasia, achondro-genesis type IB, and atelosteogenesis type II (for review, see Ref. 23.Dawson P.A. Markovich D. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although SLC26 proteins play important roles, there is very little known about the relationship between the structure and function of these proteins, particularly their quaternary structures. Prestin, SLC26A5, has 744 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 81.4 kDa. Deglycosylated prestin has an apparent molecular mass of ∼70 kDa when observed on a SDS-PAGE/Western blot. The apparent molecular mass of glycosylated prestin ranges from ∼80 to ∼100 kDa and is cell line-dependent (21.Matsuda K. Zheng J. Du G.G. Klocker N. Madison L.D. Dallos P. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 928-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). According to the predicted topology map, there are ∼400 amino acids that form the ∼12 membrane-associated domains (24.Deak L. Zheng J. Orem A. Du G.G. Aguinaga S. Matsuda K. Dallos P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 563: 483-496Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Based on the average volume per mass ratio of known proteins, a simple calculation shows that it is highly unlikely that one prestin subunit would inhabit an area as large as that occupied by the 11-nm particles. This raises the question of whether prestin exists as an oligomer in the plasma membrane. Therefore, unveiling prestin's quaternary structure is essential for understanding the mechanisms of the protein function. Hence, the goal of the present paper is to evaluate prestin's quaternary structure using different biological and genetic approaches. Results demonstrate that prestin can form higher order oligomers, probably tetramers, both in OHCs and in heterologous expression systems. The rabbit anti-C terminus mPres (anti-C-mPres) polyclonal antibody (21.Matsuda K. Zheng J. Du G.G. Klocker N. Madison L.D. Dallos P. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 928-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was used in a 1:2000 dilution in immunofluorescence and Western blot experiments. Anti-V5 (Invitrogen) and anti-Xpress (Invitrogen) antibodies were used in a 1:5000 dilution in Western blot. Donkey anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (horseradish peroxidase) and donkey anti-mouse IgG-HRP were purchased from Pierce or Jackson ImmunoResearch. Native Tissue—All surgical and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the policies of Northwestern University's Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Institutes of Health. Cochleae from either wild type or prestin KO mice were collected in CelLytic mammalian tissue lysis/extraction reagent (Sigma C3228) supplemented with a combination of inhibiters (100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1:50 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340), 0.01% thimerosal, 10 units/ml DNase). In some case 100 mm iodoacetamide was also added. Mammalian Cell Expression System—C-tag prestin, gerbil prestin tagged at the C terminus with the hexahistidine and V5 epitope, was described previously (25.Zheng J. Long K.B. Shen W. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The plasmid, pcDNA3.1-CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase), was used as a transfection control. C-tag prestin and pcDNA 3.1-CAT plasmids were transiently expressed in TSA-201 cells, a subclone of human embryonic kidney 293 cells. TSA-201 cells were cultured and transiently transfected with Effectene (Qiagen) as previously described (25.Zheng J. Long K.B. Shen W. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After 48 h of incubation cells were collected in either the Sigma CelLytic cell lysis/extraction reagent or hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with the inhibitor combination and 100 mm iodoacetamide. Yeast Expression System—Mouse prestin (from Glu-8 to Ala-744) or the C-terminal domain (from Val-499 to Ala-744) was inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2/NT-A (Invitrogen) under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Constructs were tagged N-terminally with both the His tag and the Xpress epitope and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain INVSc1 (His–, Leu–, Trp–, and Ura–) (Invitrogen) and grown on selective plates or SC medium without uracil according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The selected yeast clone was grown overnight at 30 °C in SC medium without uracil containing 2% glucose with shaking. The yeast were harvested by centrifugation and were then re-grown in induction medium (SC medium without uracil plus 2% galactose) for 24 h. Prestin-expressing yeast were collected by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. For prestin-protein expression analysis, yeast pellets were resuspended in breaking buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5% glycerol) supplemented with the inhibiter combination and 100 mm iodoacetamide. Acid-washed glass beads (420–500 μm) were added to yeast to break cell walls. Yeast lysate was then either mixed with lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) or perfluoro-octanoate (PFO) loading buffer and run on LDS-PAGE or PFO-PAGE/Western blot. After the yeast were grown in induction medium for 6 h, the induced culture was mixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking for 30 min. Yeast were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 2% formaldehyde/PBS at 4 °C overnight and then rinsed 4 times with PBS. The yeast were then resuspended in protoplast buffer (PBS plus 1.2 m sorbitol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and ∼50 μg/ml lyticase) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The resulting cells/spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 s and washed 3 times with sorbitol buffer (PBS plus 1.2 m sorbitol) before being permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/sorbitol buffer (10 min on ice). Suspended yeast were then plated on a multiwell slide (Carlson Scientific, Peotone, IL) coated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine and incubated in PBS containing anti-C-mPres. After washing with PBS, the samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. The samples were mounted on glass slides with mounting solution (Fluoromount-G) and observed using a Leica confocal system with a standard configuration DMRXE7 microscope. After homogenization, low speed centrifugation (800 × g for 10 min) was first applied to the samples to separate the nuclei, unlysed cells, and bone structures. Cell lysates were then mixed with 2× LDS Laemmli sample buffer combined with different concentrations of reducing reagents including either dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol, or ethanedithiol before being loaded on a 4–20% Precise gel (Pierce) or a 5% NEXT gel (New Electrophoresis X'PRESS Technology) (Amresco, Solon, OH). LDS was used instead of SDS because the latter precipitates in the cold (49.Broglie R.M. Hunter C.N. Delepelaire P. Niederman R.A. Chua N.H. Clayton R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S./ A. 1980; 77: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For NEXT-PAGE, the buffer system was also purchased from Amresco. After separation the gel proteins were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane or Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore), blocked with 2% nonfat dry milk and 2% bovine serum albumin, and reacted with primary antibodies (anti-C-mPres, anti-V5, or anti-Xpress) and then with the corresponding secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase or anti-mouse IgG-horse-radish peroxidase). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the ECL Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). The apparent molecular masses were calculated by non-linear curve-fitting of the molecular weight standards indicated at the right of each gel. After nuclei removal the cell lysates were mixed with various amounts of PFO and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Lysates were then added to the PFO loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, various amounts of PFO, 20% (v/v) glycerol with 100 mm DTT). Proteins were loaded and fractionated by PFO-PAGE as described (26.Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 4–20% Precise protein gels (Pierce) were pre-electrophosphoresed in PFO running buffer (25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, 5% (w/v) PFO, pH 8.5) for 5 min before samples were loaded. The subsequent Western blot process was the same as that for the LDS-PAGE/Western blot described above. Full-length mPrestin (from Met-1—Ala-744) was inserted into the bait expression vector pAMBV4 (DUALmembrane Biotech, Switzerland) with CUB-LexA-VP16 downstream of, and in-frame with mPrestin. The bait vector carries the LEU2 gene for auxotrophic selection. The sequence of the prestin-bait vector was confirmed through DNA sequencing. The expression of the mPrestin-Cub-LexA-VP16 fusion protein was further verified by Western blot analysis with anti-C-mPres. The full-length mPrestin was also inserted into the prey-expressing vector pDL2-Nx (DUALmembrane Biotech) with NubG upstream of, and in-frame with prestin. The prey vector carries the TRP1 gene for auxotrophic selection. pMBV-Alg5 is a negative control bait construct that expresses the Cub-LexA-VP16 fusion protein in the correct orientation in the yeast membrane. The prestin-bait construct and the negative control, pMBV-Alg5, were transformed into yeast strain DSY-1 (MATa his3Δ200 trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 ade2 LYS2: (lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ GAL4) (DUALmembrane Biotech) and grown on leucine-selective plates (SD-L). Prestin-prey constructs were transformed into prestin-bait-expressing yeast or pMBV-Alg5-expressing yeast and grown on leucine-tryptophan double-selective plates (SD-LT). Positive interactions were identified by the ability of yeast to grow on leucine-tryptophan-histidine triple-selective plates (SD-LTH) in the presence of 2 mm 3-aminotriazole and by β-galactosidase expression, indicated by the blue color observed in the presence of X-gal. TSA-201 cells transfected with C-tag prestin (25.Zheng J. Long K.B. Shen W. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were collected 48 h after transfection. The cells were homogenized with a Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton) in the hypotonic lysis buffer described above. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. The whole-cell lysate was treated with 8% PFO for 24 h at room temperature. The undissolved pellet was separated by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was filtered (0.45-μm filter) before application to 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Invitrogen). The resin was poured into a column and washed with 1× native binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 4% PFO and, sequentially, either 20 or 80 mm imidazole. Prestin was eluted with 1× native binding buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and 4% PFO. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and analyzed by PFO-PAGE/Western blot. Cochleae were dissected and washed in PBS, pH 8.0. The bony cochlear wall was opened at the helicotrema as well as at both oval and round windows, with minimal disruption to the organ of Corti. The cochleae were perfused and incubated with different concentrations of freshly made chemical cross-linker solutions: bismaleimidohexane (BMH) (Pierce) or bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (Pierce). BMH was dissolved in Me2SO, and BS3 was dissolved in PBS, pH 8.0. Perfused cochleae were agitated on an orbital shaker at room temperature for 30 min. Control cochleae, both wild type and knockout, were treated with the same solution but with no cross-linker added. Reactions were stopped by perfusion of 20 mm Tris-buffer, pH 7.5, for BS3 treatment or 50 mm DTT for BMH treatment and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The cochleae were washed with PBS and homogenized in Sigma CelLytic mammalian tissue lysis/extraction reagent as described above. The whole-cell lysate was mixed with 2× LDS loading buffer and run on 5% NEXT gel/SDS-PAGE (Amresco) followed by Western blot. Prestin Is Expressed and Located in the Plasma Membrane of Different Expression Systems—Prestin cDNA was inserted into different expression vectors and transfected into various hosts including yeast and mammalian cell lines. Prestin protein expression was analyzed using both immunofluorescence and LDS-PAGE/Western blot. Our data show that full-length prestin could be synthesized in yeast as demonstrated by both immunofluorescence (Fig. 1b) and Western blot experiments (Fig. 1d). Yeast expressing full-length prestin protein showed distinct annular images when assayed with anti-C-mPres indexed with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the yeast expressing only the C-terminal domain of prestin showed a diffuse fluorescence throughout the entire cell, a typical distribution pattern for cytoplasmic proteins (Fig. 1c). The negative control, uninduced yeast, showed no staining (Fig. 1a). These data suggest that the full-length protein is located in the membrane of yeast, whereas the C-terminal domain is not. Prestin-expressing mammalian cells can also synthesize full-length prestin and insert it into the plasma membrane (21.Matsuda K. Zheng J. Du G.G. Klocker N. Madison L.D. Dallos P. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 928-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LDS-PAGE/Western blots of yeast transfected with full-length prestin revealed the presence of individual and DTT- and LDS-resistant oligomers; the lowest band had an apparent molecular mass similar to a monomer of deglycosylated prestin (∼70 kDa). As shown in Fig. 1d, the second and third bands are approximately two and three times the molecular mass of the monomer, suggesting the existence of prestin monomers and higher order oligomers. The uninduced yeast (–G), used as a control, did not show prestin bands. Cochleae from prestin knock-out mice were also compared with those of wild type mice in an LDS-PAGE/Western blot with anti-C-mPres (Fig. 1e). Two prestin-specific bands corresponding to a prestin monomer (∼90 kDa) and a dimer (∼200 kDa) appear in wild type mice but not in prestin knock-out mice. These data indicate that prestin may physically bind to itself in its native state to form oligomers. It is also noted that prestin protein with a monomeric calculated mass of 80.5 kDa did not always migrate the same distance. Instead, bands running from ∼70 kDa (yeast) to ∼100 kDa (OHC) were observed. This variation is probably due to glycosylation and/or other modifications specific to the host cells (21.Matsuda K. Zheng J. Du G.G. Klocker N. Madison L.D. Dallos P. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 928-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Prestin Associates with Itself in Living Cells—Prestin is a highly hydrophobic protein with 12 predicted membrane-associated domains containing more than 50% of the amino acids (24.Deak L. Zheng J. Orem A. Du G.G. Aguinaga S. Matsuda K. Dallos P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 563: 483-496Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Proteins with hydrophobic natures often have a propensity to aggregate once cells are lysed and solubilized with detergents. In fact, artificial oligomers are found in some proteins (27.Jorgensen C.S. Ryder L.R. Steino A. Hojrup P. Hansen J. Beyer N.H. Heegaard N.H. Houen G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4140-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28.Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 29.Kroeger K.M. Pfleger K.D. Eidne K.A. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2003; 24: 254-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, it needs to be considered that the multiple bands observed on Western blot (Fig. 1) could be artifacts. To further evaluate prestin-prestin self-association, we analyzed prestin-prestin interaction using a membrane-based yeast two-hybrid system based on the split-ubiquitin assay. It is well known that native ubiquitin can be split into N-terminal (Nub) and C-terminal (Cub) domains. Nub and Cub retain their basic affinity for each other and spontaneously reassemble to form functional ubiquitin (30.Johnsson N. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10340-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). However, a point mutation (I→ G) in the Nub (NubG) domain can greatly diminish the affinity of the two halves, i.e. NubG and Cub do not refold into functional ubiquitin. However, when NubG and Cub are fused to a “bait” and a “prey” protein respectively, any interaction between bait and prey brings NubG and Cub close together, inducing them to form functional ubiquitin despite their weak affinity. This action results in the release of an artificial transcription factor, LexA-VP16, which enters the nucleus and activates the lacZ and His3 genes. Expression of the His3 gene allows yeast growth on His– selective media, whereas expression of the lacZ gene allows yeast clones to appear blue on X-gal plates. Alternatively, if the prey does not interact with prestin, LexA-VP16 is not released, and no growth or color change is observed. In these experiments we inserted Prestin cDNA into the bait expression vector, pAMBV4, using an in vivo recombination method. Cub and LexA-VP16 are located downstream of, and in-frame with prestin. This prestin-bait combined protein has 1103 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 120.5 kDa. Western blots in Fig. 2A show that a prestin protein band with apparent molecular mass of ∼120 kDa is found only in the prestin-bait yeast clone. Because there is no homologous prestin gene in yeast, the absence of a prestin band is expected in the negative control yeast, containing the Alg5-bait (pMBV-Alg5 construct). To ensure that the prestin-bait expressed in yeast can interact with prey proteins, prestin-bait yeast were transformed with the positive prey control plasmid pAlg5-NubI (Dualsystems Biotech). Because Alg5 does not interact with the oligosaccharyltransferase complex (31.Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), it will not interact with a glycoprotein-like prestin. However, if prestin is correctly expressed in yeast, wild type Nub part (NubI) can bind to the Cub part that is attached to the C terminus of prestin, resulting in yeast growth on a His–-selective medium. A double dropout (SD-LT) medium was used to select yeast expressing bait (Leu–) and prey (Trp–, Fig. 2B), whereas a triple dropout (SD-LTH) medium was used to select yeast expressing both bait and prey as well as interactions between them (Fig. 2C). Because it does not require bait-prey interaction to reconstitute ubiquitin, a NubI-prey (pAlg5-NubI) fusion protein can bind Cub from prestin-bait as long as the Cub-LexA-VP16 moiety of the prestin-bait is present on the cytosolic side of the membrane. Fig. 2C shows that prestin-Cub-LexA-VP16/pAlg5-NubI yeast grows on the selective plate (SD-LTH, Prestin/NubI) and shows a blue color, indicating X-gal degradation by the reporter gene lacZ (data not shown). As a negative control, pAlg5-NubG was co-transformed with prestin-bait. As expected,"
https://openalex.org/W2026343517,"Over 125 pigmentation-related genes have been identified to date. Of those, PMEL17/GP100 has been widely studied as a melanoma-specific antigen as well as a protein required for the formation of fibrils in melanosomes. PMEL17 is synthesized, glycosylated, processed, and delivered to melanosomes, allowing them to mature from amorphous round vesicles to elongated fibrillar structures. In contrast to other melanosomal proteins such as TYR and TYRP1, the processing and sorting of PMEL17 is highly complex. Monoclonal antibody HMB45 is commonly used for melanoma detection, but has the added advantage that it specifically reacts with sialylated PMEL17 in the fibrillar matrix in melanosomes. In this study, we generated mutant forms of PMEL17 to clarify the subdomain of PMEL17 required for formation of the fibrillar matrix, a process critical to pigmentation. The internal proline/serine/threonine-rich repeat domain (called the RPT domain) of PMEL17 undergoes variable proteolytic cleavage. Deletion of the RPT domain abolished its recognition by HMB45 and its capacity to form fibrils. Truncation of the C-terminal domain did not significantly affect the processing or trafficking of PMEL17, but, in contrast, deletion of the N-terminal domain abrogated both. We conclude that the RPT domain is essential for its function in generating the fibrillar matrix of melanosomes and that the luminal domain is necessary for its correct processing and trafficking to those organelles.

Melanoma is one of the most notorious tumors because of its poor prognosis (1Balch C.M. Soong S.J. Atkins M.B. Buzaid A.C. Cascinelli N. Coit D.G. Fleming I.D. Gershenwald J.E. Houghton Jr., A.

Several groups have raised monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize melanoma cells, with HMB45 being the most popular and frequently used in clinics for the specific detection of melanocytic tumors (2Gown A.M.

Stage II melanosomes result from the elongation of those vesicles and the appearance within of distinct fibrillar structures. The production of internal matrix fibers, which discriminate Stage II from Stage I melanosomes, depends on the maturation and trafficking of PMEL17 (12Berson J.F. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G.

In pigmented cells, melanins are synthesized and deposited on those fibers, resulting in a progressively pigmented internal matrix, at which time the organelles are termed Stage III melanosomes.

Moreover, even in non-melanocytic cells, when adequately overexpressed, PMEL17 can also produce fibrillar structures within lysosome-like structures (12Berson J.F. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G.

Although PMEL17 is studied widely as a melanoma antigen, as noted above, it also plays a crucial role in normal melanocytes as a structural protein in melanosomes (17Kawakami Y. Robbins P.F.

PMEL17 is a type I membrane protein that consists of several domains predicted by homology modeling (see Fig. 1A). SIG is the signal peptide thought to determine the entry of PMEL17 into the secretory pathway prior to its processing and cleavage (19Maresh G.A. Wang W.-C. Beam K.S. Malacko A.R. Hellstrom I.

Acta. 1995; 1256: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); however, nothing has been reported about the function of the KRG domain in PMEL17. TM is the predicted transmembrane domain. The remaining domains are referred to as the N-terminal domain (NTD), the GAP1, GAP2, GAP3 domains, and the C-terminal domain (CTD). PMEL17 has five potential N-glycosylation sites; however, Asn321 in the RPT domain is thought not to be utilized (19Maresh G.A. Wang W.-C. Beam K.S. Malacko A.R. Hellstrom I. Hellstrom K.E.

Pigment Cell Res. 2005; 18: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Three of those N-glycosylation sites are located in the NTD, and another is in the GAP3 domain. Four isoforms of PMEL17 are generated by alternative splicing (6Adema G.J. de Boer A.J. Vogel A.M. Loenen W.A.M. Figdor C.G. J. Biol.

PMEL17-i is the full-length protein sequence, whereas PMEL17-is and PMEL17-ls have truncated RPT domains. The “l” in PMEL17-l and PMEL17-ls indicates the insertion of 7 additional amino acids in the GAP3 domain immediately following the N-glycosylation site. PMEL17-i is the most abundant form (21Nichols S.E. Harper D.C. Berson J.F. Marks M.S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 4T.

Briefly, P1/P100 (hereafter termed P1) is the major endoplasmic reticulum (ER; or early Golgi)-modified form of PMEL17, which contains high mannose-type (but not complex-type) N-glycans and which is endoglycosidase H-sensitive. A relatively small amount of P1 then undergoes further glycosylation in the Golgi to generate P2/P120 (hereafter termed P2), the late Golgi-modified form, which still has at least one high mannose- or hybrid-type N-glycan and which is largely endoglycosidase H-resistant (12Berson J.F. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3451-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 27Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28330-28338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). P2 is then cleaved proteolytically (between Arg469 and Gln470) within post-Golgi and/or premelanosomal compartments into Mα and Mβ/P26 (hereafter termed Mβ) fragments. Those two fragments remain linked by a disulfide bond. Mα is thought to be further processed to generate the striated fibrils seen in Stage II melanosomes, although the putative cleavage site(s) in the Mα fragment are unknown. HMB45 is thought to react with the processed form of Mα; however, there is no convincing evidence for this at the molecular level. Although there is no controversy that PMEL17 is found in Stage II melanosomes (12Berson J.F. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S. Mol. Biol.

Several studies have shown that HMB45 reactivity is lost when PMEL17 is digested to remove sialic acids (27Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T. Appella E. Hearing V.J. J.

Cytochem. 1992; 40: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but there is as yet no report utilizing that characteristic to define the precise epitope or its implications to the processing and trafficking of PMEL17. In this study, we focused on characterizing the domain of PMEL17 involved with fibril formation using HMB45 as a fibril-specific probe. We generated mutants of PMEL17 to determine the domains critical to the formation of fibrils and to assess the correct processing and trafficking of PMEL17 that are essential to its function in melanogenesis. We show that HMB45 reacts preferentially with a detergent-insoluble form of PMEL17 and that its epitope, which contains sialylated O-glycans, is located in the second and third amino acid repeats of the RPT domain. The heterogeneous bands detected by HMB45 staining are due to the multiple cleavage points in the RPT domain. Surprisingly, correct processing and trafficking of PMEL17 to LAMP-2-positive organelles are maintained when the RPT domain or the CTD is deleted, but PMEL17 is missorted when other luminal domain(s) are missing, suggesting that important sorting signals are within that region of PMEL17. Cell Cultures—Highly pigmented MNT-1 melanoma cells, unpigmented SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells, and HeLa cells were obtained and cultured as described previously (15Hoashi T. Watabe H. Muller J. Yamaguchi Y. Vieira W.D. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14006-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Transfection—The pCI mammalian expression vector was purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). pCI-Pmel17-i, pCI-Pmel17-l, and pCI-Pmel17-s (containing PMEL17-i, PMEL17-l, and PMEL17-ls, respectively, in the pCI vector) were kind gifts from Dr. Michael S. Marks (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). pCI-Pmel17-is was constructed by subcloning the NsiI-XbaI fragments of pCI-Pmel17-i into pCI-Pmel17-s. The ΔCS mutation (K468Q and R469Q) in pCI-Pmel17-i, pCI-Pmel17-l, pCI-Pmel17-is, and pCI-Pmel17-ls was introduced as described previously (16Berson J.F. Theos A.C. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Similarly, ΔSIG, ΔNTD, ΔPKD, ΔGAP1, ΔRPT, ΔGAP2, ΔKRG, ΔGAP3, ΔTM, ΔCTD, RPTa-i, RPTa-g, RPTa-f, RPTa-e, RPTa-d, RPTa-c, RPTa-b, RPTb-j, RPTc-j, and RPTe-j were constructed using pCI-Pmel17-i as the template. The di-alanine mutation from di-leucine sorting signal at the C terminus of PMEL17-i (LL662AA) was also introduced. RPTsa-i and RPTsa-h were constructed using pCI-Pmel17-is as the template. PMEL17-i-hemagglutinin (HA) was constructed by inserting the HA tag sequence between Gly173 and Thr174 of pCI-Pmel17-i as described above. LAMP-2-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was constructed by inserting the PCR-amplified pCRII-LAMP-2 fragment into the XhoI-BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). All constructs were sequence-verified and transfected into HeLa cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (15Hoashi T. Watabe H. Muller J. Yamaguchi Y. Vieira W.D. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14006-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was ∼70∼80% as assayed by monitoring fluorescence signals using the pEGFP-C3 vector. Antibodies and Reagents—α-PEP13h and α-mSiN polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits against synthetic peptides corresponding to the C terminus of human PMEL17 and the N terminus of murine Silver, respectively (27Yasumoto K.

HMB45 (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA), HMB50 (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) and NKI/beteb (NeoMarkers) were used to detect PMEL17. Anti-LAMP-2 (Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ) and anti-green fluorescent protein (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) antibodies were also used. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells cultured on 2-well Lab-Tek Chamber Slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were immunostained as described previously (15Hoashi T. Watabe H. Muller J.

The reactivities of Alexa Fluor 488, 594, and 647 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were visualized as green, red, and blue signals, respectively. All preparations were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with HeNe (543 and 633 nm), argon, and krypton laser sources. Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy was performed as described previously (15Hoashi T. Watabe H. Muller J. Yamaguchi Y. Vieira W.D. Hearing V.J. J. Biol.

Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting—Cell extracts were prepared using the M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce), 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), or 1% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem) in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatants were harvested as soluble fractions. The protein concentration of each soluble fraction was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Pellets were washed once with the corresponding lysis buffer and then resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE buffer as insoluble fractions. Equivalent amounts of soluble and insoluble fractions were used. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (15Hoashi T. Watabe H. Muller J. Yamaguchi Y. Vieira W.D. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14006-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were pulsed for 30 min with [35S]Met/Cys (GE Healthcare) and then chased for 4 h. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Immunopurified samples were electrophoresed and visualized by fluorography as described previously (15Hoashi T. Watabe H. Muller J. Yamaguchi Y. Vieira W.D. Hearing V.J. J. Biol.

HMB45 Detects the Mα Form of PMEL17 by Immunoblotting—Pigmented MNT-1 cells, unpigmented SK-MEL-28 cells, and HeLa cells transfected with empty vector, PMEL17-i, or PMEL17-is were analyzed by immunoblotting using HMB45 and α-PEP13h antibody. MNT-1 cells, SK-MEL-28 cells, and HeLa cells overexpressing PMEL17-i or PMEL17-is showed HMB45-positive ∼30-50-kDa bands in common (Fig. 2, left panel), as reported previously (27Yasumoto K.

Vella F. Bonetti F. Pea M. Ferrari S. Martignoni G. Benedetti A. Suzuki H. Melanoma Res. 1996; 6: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PMEL17-i showed three distinct bands (or clusters of bands), one at ∼100 kDa, another at ∼50 kDa, and another at ∼30 kDa (with a faint band at ∼120 kDa). PMEL17-is also showed three distinct bands, but at ∼80, ∼45, and ∼30 kDa (with a faint band ∼110 kDa). Equivalents of those bands were also found in MNT-1 cells, although the reactivities for some of them were relatively lower. The difference between the PMEL17-i and PMEL17-is constructs is only a small 7-amino acid deletion in the RPT domain, which implies that the differences in HMB45 staining patterns is closely associated with the RPT domain. Only two fast migrating and minor HMB45-reactive bands were detected in SK-MEL-28 cells, the fastest being somewhat larger than that seen in MNT-1 cells or in PMEL17-transfected HeLa cells. This might be due a variation in post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and/or sialylation, but is not simply due to the fact that SK-MEL-28 cells are unpigmented (31Hubbard S.C. Ivatt R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 555-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). We also performed immunoblotting using anti-PEP13h antibody, which reacts specifically with the C terminus of PMEL17 (27Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T. Appella E.

P1 or P1s (the short form of P1 derived from PMEL17-is or PMEL17-ls) and Mβ were clearly identified in MNT-1 cells and in PMEL17-i- and PMEL17-is-transfected cells (Fig. 2, right panel). An unknown band, P75 (∼75 kDa), was detected in MNT-1 cells (15Hoashi T. Watabe H. Muller J. Yamaguchi Y. Vieira W.D. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14006-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); however, it was not detected in HeLa cells overexpressing any isoforms of PMEL17 (Fig. 2, right panel). What are those high molecular mass bands (∼100 or 80 kDa) that are recognized by HMB45 except in SK-MEL-28 cells? Similar bands were visible in some previous reports, but were not mentioned, probably because they were considered to be nonspecific (15Hoashi T. Watabe H. Muller J. Yamaguchi Y. Vieira W.D.

Comparison of immunoblots using HMB45 or α-PEP13h antibody revealed bands at ∼120 kDa in PMEL17-i and at ∼110 kDa in PMEL17-is that represent P2 and P2s (the short form of P2 derived from PMEL17-is or PMEL17-ls), respectively. This raises the question at to why P1 was not detected by HMB45 in that extract. HMB45 requires sialylation to generate its epitope (27Yasumoto K. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Kobayashi T.

Cytochem. 1992; 40: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), sialylation being the terminal step of glycosylation. P1 then is the ER-modified form that is not detected by HMB45. Taken together, bands at ∼120, 110, 100, and 80 kDa correspond to P2, P2s, Mα, and Mαs (the short form of Mα, which are derived from PMEL17-is or -ls), respectively, whereas the smaller ∼30-60 kDa bands are derivatives of Mα or Mαs; thus, we tentatively name them MαC, MαC1, MαC2, and MαC3 (Fig. 2, left panel). HMB45 Recognizes the RPT Domain of PMEL17—To identify the HMB45-reactive domain of PMEL17, we designed a series of 10 deletion mutants of PMEL17 as follows: ΔSIG, ΔNTD, ΔPKD, ΔGAP1, ΔRPT, ΔGAP2, ΔKRG, ΔGAP3, ΔTM, and ΔCTD. These expression constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, and their immunoreactivity with HMB45 was assessed (Fig. 3A). The ΔSIG and ΔRPT constructs did not react at all with HMB45, and reactivity with ΔTM was greatly reduced. All other constructs reacted well, although HMB45-positive granules in ΔNTD, ΔPKD, ΔGAP1, and ΔGAP2 were located mainly in the perinuclear region rather than being dispersed in the cytoplasm. The reactivities of these constructs were also analyzed by immunoblotting using HMB45 and α-PEP13h antibody (Fig. 3B). ΔSIG showed no reactivity with HMB45, and only a single band that migrated faster than P1 was detected by α-PEP13h antibody. Signal peptides classically function to target proteins to enter the ER; thus, it is reasonable that ΔSIG would not undergo glycosylation, would have a relatively smaller P1, and would not react with HMB45. According to a previous report that the P2-to-Mα/Mβ cleavage occurs in post-Golgi and prelysosomal compartments (16Berson J.F. Theos A.C. Harper D.C. Tenza D. Raposo G. Marks M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), it is also reasonable that Mβ was not detected in ΔSIG. These results suggest that SIG in PMEL17 is essential for entering the secretory pathway, as expected. ΔNTD showed two bands recognized by HMB45 at relatively lower intensities, a major one that was smaller than Mα and the other corresponding to MαC. However, the major bands (MαC1 and Mα"

When we silenced expression of GPx4 isoforms during in vitro embryogenesis using short interfering RNA technology, we observed that knockdown of mitochondrial GPx4 strongly impaired segmentation of rhombomeres 5 and 6 during hindbrain development and induced cerebral apoptosis. In contrast, silencing expression of the nuclear isoform led to retardations in atrium formation.

Montoya M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and in a sentential region of murine chromosome 10 (10Knopp E.A. Arndt T.L. Eng K.L.

The start codons for the m- and c-GPx4 isoforms as well as the targeting sequence that directs the mitochondrial enzyme into the mitochondria are localized in the first exon of the GPx4 gene. Expression of the 34-kDa n-GPx4 (nuclear isoform) involves transcription of an alternative first exon (12Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The three phGPx isoforms are expressed at low to medium levels in most mammalian cells and have been implicated in expression regulation of redox-sensitive genes (13Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radic.

High concentrations of GPx4 were found in testis (16Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohe L. Maiorino M. Biofactors. 2001; 14: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and low level expression of the protein has been related to male infertility (17Maiorino M. Bosello V. Ursini F. Foresta C.

In contrast, mice in which expression of the n-GPx4 was selectively silenced were viable and surprisingly also fully fertile (18Conrad M. Moreno S.G. Sinowatz F. Ursini F. Kolle S. Roveri A.

These data suggest that m- and/or c-GPx4 are more important for murine embryogenesis than n-GPx4. More detailed studies on intrauterine development of GPx4-/- mice indicated that the embryos fail to develop embryonic cavities but are characterized by enlarged Reichert's membranes. At stage E7.5, when normal embryos have completed gastrulation, homozygous GPx4-deficient mice still resemble pregastrulation embryos showing primitive signs of endo-, meso-, and ectodermic differentiation. At later stages (E8.0-8.5Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), when normal embryos undergo organ development, GPx4-deficient individuals enter intrauterine resorption. Heterozygous GPx4-deficient mice are viable and fertile and develop normally (7Yant L.J. Ran Q. Rao L. Van Remmen H. Shibatani T. Belter J.G. Motta L. Richardson A. Prolla T.A. Free Radic. Biol.

However, these animals exhibit a reduced survival in response to γ-irradiation, suggesting an impaired antioxidative capacity of the individuals. In fact, cell lines derived from GPx4+/- mice were markedly more sensitive to inducers of oxidative stress as compared with cell lines derived from wild-type control littermates (7Yant L.J. Ran Q. Rao L. Van Remmen H. Shibatani T. Belter J.G. Motta L. Richardson A. Prolla T.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicated that expression of mitochondrial and/or cytosolic GPx4 isoforms is required for normal embryogenesis, whereas the nuclear isoform may not be essential. Unfortunately, the biological reasons for premature embryonic lethality remain unclear. To address this question, we studied expression of the three GPx4 isoforms during normal embryogenesis and explored the impact of silencing expression of these isoforms during in vitro embryogenesis. At late embryonic stages, we observed abnormal development of hindbrain (m-GPx4 silencing) and heart (n-GPx4 silencing). These data may explain in part the intrauterine lethality of GPx4-deficient mice. Chemicals—The chemicals used were from the following sources: Superscript III reverse transcriptase and RNaseOUT from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany); BD Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix from BD Biosciences (Pharmingen, Germany); dNTPs from Carl Roth GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany); DNA molecular weight markers (100 bp, 1 kb) from New England Biolabs GmbH (Schwabach, Germany); and the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). PCR primers were custom-synthesized by BIOTEZ (Berlin, Germany). Preparation of Whole Murine Embryos and of Various Embryonic Tissues—All animal experiments were performed in strict adherence to the guidelines for experimentation with laboratory animals as set by the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Inbred Institute for Cancer Research pregnant mice were obtained from an animal house, and embryos in different developmental stages (E6.5 to postnatal day 5 (N5)) were prepared and kept in PBS (0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate) for separation of extraembryonic tissues and the embryo proper. These preparations were carried out under a stereo microscope (Olympus, New York). At later developmental stages, embryonic brain and heart (from E10.5 to N5) were separately dissected. Different embryonic tissues from the same litter were pooled, and at least three dams were collected independently. Tissue samples were kept in RNAlater solution (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at 4 °C overnight and were then stored at -80 °C prior to RNA extraction. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was extracted from the embryonic tissues using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). It was reverse transcribed into the corresponding cDNA using oligo(dT)15 primer and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the vendor's instructions. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—The PCR samples (total volume of 25 μl) consisted of 40 mm Tricine buffer, pH 8.7, containing 0.5 μl of RT reaction, 15 mm potassium acetate, 3.5 mm magnesium acetate, 3.75 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.005% Tween 20, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 200 nm forward and reverse primers (Table 1), 200 μm dNTPs (final concentrations are given), and 0.5 μl of 50× BD Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix. The following PCR protocol was used to amplify the target gene products: preconditioning phase of 90 s at 95 °C; denaturing phase of 30 s at 95 °C followed by an annealing/extension phase of 60 s at 68 °C. After 35 cycles of amplification, a final extension phase (3 min at 68 °C) was run, and the samples were stored at 4 °C. For electrophoresis, usually 10 μl of the PCR was used, and the PCR products were separated in a 2% agarose gel. The DNA bands were routinely stained with ethidium bromide and quantified by densitometric evaluation of the gels in relation to a known mass ladder standard.TABLE 1Primers used for amplification of the different phGPx isoforms and for preparation of the labeled probes used for in situ hybridizationGene productDirectionPrimer SequenceSizebpRT-PCRGAPDHForward5′-CCA TCA CCA TCT TCC AGG AGC GA-3′447Reverse5′-GGA TGA CCT TGC CCA CAG CCT TG-3′m+c-GPx4Forward5′-CGC CTG GTC TGG CAG GCA CCA-3′467Reverse5′-ACG CAG CCG TTC TTA TCA ATG AGA A-3′m-GPx4Forward5′-GAG ATG AGC TGG GGC CGT CTG A-3′531Reverse5′-ACG CAG CCG TTC TTA TCA ATG AGA A-3′n-GPx4Forward5′-AGT TCC TGG GCT TGT GTG CAT CC-3′458Reverse5′-ACG CAG CCG TTC TTA TCA ATG AGA A-3′In situ hybridization probesm-GPx4 (exon 1A)Forward5′-CTC GGC CTC GCG CGT CCA TTG-3′146Reverse5′-TGG TGC CTG CCA GAC CAG GCG-3′n-GPx4 (exon 1B)Forward5′-AGC GGG GAC GCT GCA GAC AGC-3′230Reverse5′-CAA GCC CAG GAA CTC GGA GCT G-3′All isoforms (exons 2-3)Forward5′-GTG CAT CCC GCG ATG ATT GGC G-3′255Reverse5′-GAT TAC TTC CTG GCT CCT GCC TC-3′ Open table in a new tab Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Real time PCR was carried out with a Rotor Gene 3000 (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia) using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). The primer combinations specified in Table 1 were used, and the following PCR protocol was applied: 15-min hot start at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), annealing (30 s at 65 °C), and synthesis (30 s at 72 °C) in a total volume of 10 μl. Homogeneity of the amplified PCR products was tested, recording the melting curves. For this purpose, the temperature was elevated slowly from 60 to 99 °C. Data were acquired and analyzed with the Rotor-Gene Monitor software (version 4.6). The amplification kinetics were recorded in real time mode as sigmoid process curves, for which the fluorescence was plotted against the number of amplification cycles. To generate standard curves for exact quantification of gene expression levels, specific amplicons were used as external standards for each target gene and for GAPDH. The initial amplicon concentrations were set to values varying between 5 × 103 and 3 × 106 copy numbers. GAPDH mRNA was used as an internal standard to normalize expression of the target transcripts (m-GPx4, m+c-GPx4, and n-GPx4). Absolute ratios of the target mRNA species and the GAPDH mRNA, which exactly quantify the cellular expression levels of the target genes, were calculated using these standard curves. All RNA preparations were analyzed at least in triplicates, and means ± S.D. are given. Discrimination between Various GPx4 Isoforms in RT-PCR and in Situ Hybridization—Since GPx4-deficient mice die in utero at midgestation, we explored expression of different GPx4 isoforms during murine embryogenesis. Unfortunately, on the protein level, c-GPx4 and m-GPx4 cannot be distinguished, since the mitochondrial targeting sequence is cleaved off after mitochondrial import. However, such differentiation is possible on the mRNA level. We established isoform-specific real time PCR systems suitable for quantifying the expression kinetics of the different GPx4 mRNA species during the time course of murine embryogenesis. The reverse primer used for amplification of the three different GPx4 mRNAs was identical (Scheme 1B), but the forward primer for the m-GPx4 was placed inside the mitochondrial targeting sequence. In contrast, the forward primer for amplification of the n-GPx4 was placed in the alternative first exon (E1b), and both positions ensure selective amplification of the two isoforms. Selective quantification of the c-GPx4 mRNA was more complicated. To amplify this mRNA species, we placed the forward primer in exon E1a immediately after the transcriptional start site for the c-GPx4 (10Knopp E.A. Arndt T.L. Eng K.L. Caldwell M. LeBoeuf R.C. Deeb S.S. O'Brien K.D. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this primer combination did not allow separate quantification of the m-GPx4 and c-GPx4 mRNA; in fact, the sum of m-GPx4 and c-GPx4 mRNA species (m+c-GPx4) was amplified. However, we separately amplified m-GPx4 mRNA using the above mentioned m-GPx4-specific primer combination, and thus, we were able to calculate the c-GPx4 copy numbers using the following formula: [c-GPx4] = [m+c-GPx4] - [m-GPx4]. Immunohistochemistry—For immunohistochemical staining, murine brains were perfused with ice-cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde solution and were immersion-fixed overnight. Sections were prepared on a McIllwain vibratome, quenched with NH4Cl for 15 min, and blocked with 10% goat serum plus 0.1% Saponin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Blocked sections were exposed to the primary monoclonal anti-GPx4 antibody (1:200 diluted) overnight at 4 °C. After washing in 0.1% Saponin/PBS, sections were incubated at +4 °C with a fluorescent anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:500; Molecular Probes, Inc., Leiden, The Netherlands). Counterstaining of nuclei was carried out using the HOECHST dye (Roche Applied Science). Control staining was performed appropriately using a diluted preimmune serum. In Situ Hybridization—The expression of GPx4 isoforms at different developmental stages was studied by whole mount in situ hybridization. For this purpose, the whole embryos (E6.5 to E10.5) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) overnight, dehydrated in methanol, and stored at -20 °C prior to hybridization. The riboprobes were labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Applied Science) using the AmpliScribe kit (Epicenter Technologies). Whole mount in situ hybridization in the developing embryos was performed according to Wilkinson's methods (19Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridisation. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 75-83Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In both, the prehybridization and hybridization solution SDS was used instead of CHAPS, and RNase treatment of the samples was omitted. For the posthybridization washes, formamide was not included in the washing solution. Both antisense and sense probes for each mRNA species were prepared from individual plasmids cloned into the PCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). For in situ hybridization, it was impossible to separately stain for c-GPx4 (Scheme 1C). In fact, the probe we used was placed in exon 2-3 and thus indicated expression of all three GPx4 isoforms (m+c+n-GPx4). However, the probes selected for m- and n-GPx4 were isoform-specific. Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Experiments—m-GPx4 and n-GPx4 targeting siRNA probes were prepared from mouse cDNA plasmids. Antisense and sense RNA were separately amplified by T7 RNA polymerase using MEGAscript Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Annealed double-stranded RNA (15 μg) was digested with RNase III (15 units) for 1 h at 37°C using the Silencer siRNA mixture kit (Ambion). Purified and concentrated siRNAs (1.0 μg/μl) were first mixed with 0.01% Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then microinjected with an ASTP (application solution transgenic platform) micromanipulator (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) into the amniotic cavity of the developing embryos at early headfold stage (E7.5). Sham-operated controls were injected with Lipofectamine alone without siRNA. Embryos were placed in a whole embryo culture roller incubator (BTC Engineering, Cambridge, UK) and allowed to develop for 72 h in 100% heat-inactivated rat serum with a continuous flow of gas mixtures (20Chan L.Y. Chiu P.Y. Siu N.S. Wang C.C. Lau T.K. Reprod. Toxicol. 2002; 16: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Detection of Apoptotic Cells (TUNEL Assay)—After in situ hybridization, the siRNA-treated embryos and corresponding controls were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed at 4 °C in PBS, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax, and cut into 5-μm sections. Apoptotic cells were stained by the standard TUNEL technique. For this purpose, the tissue sections were incubated with the Tdt enzyme and conjugated with anti-digoxigenin peroxidase (Chemicon) for color development. Expression of GPx4 in Adult Murine Brain—Homozygous GPx4 knock-out mice die in utero during a time window that is important for early development of the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. To investigate whether or not retardations in brain development might contribute to embryonic lethality, we first tested expression of GPx4 in adult murine brain. Immunohistochemical staining with an anti-GPx4 antibody, which was raised against the pure full-length recombinant human enzyme (Sec-Cys mutant expressed in Escherichia coli) indicated that cortical neurons express GPx4 at high levels (Fig. 1). Furthermore, pyramidal neurons were highly immunopositive for GPx4. Interestingly, both the neuronal cell bodies and the corresponding dendrites were stained positive. Moreover, leptomeninges expressed GPx4, whereas white matter regions, glia cells, and astrocytes largely remained immune negative (Fig. 1). Since our antibody does not distinguish between the different GPx4 isoenzymes, isoform-specific differences could not be investigated. These data indicate for the first time expression of GPx4 protein in cortical neurons, suggesting a biological role of the enzyme for neuronal function and/or neuron development. Expression Kinetics of GPx4 Isoforms during Murine Embryogenesis—If GPx4 is important for neuronal function, systemic silencing of the enzyme during embryogenesis might contribute to premature lethality. To obtain evidence for GPx4 expression during the time course of murine embryogenesis, we first profiled expression kinetics of GPx4 mRNAs by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2) and found that mRNA species encoding for all three GPx4 isoforms were continuously expressed. At late gestation (E14.5 and later), expression of m- and n-GPx4 mRNA was apparently somewhat reduced, and a similar decrease was observed for m+c-GPx4 (Fig. 2A). Exact quantification of the copy numbers of the different mRNA species indicated that during midgestation, c- and m-GPx4 were expressed at similar levels. From Fig. 2B, it can be seen that about 100-200 copies of the c-GPx4 mRNA and 100-200 copies of the m-GPx4 were found per 103 copies of GAPDH mRNA. In contrast, expression of n-GPx4 was significantly lower (30-60 mRNA copies per 103 copies of GAPDH mRNA). This expression kinetics indicates that at the peak of GPx4 expression during murine embryogenesis, almost 500 copies of GPx4 mRNA species were present per 1000 copies of GAPDH mRNA. Such values may be considered high level expression. Interestingly, expression of the n-GPx4 (Fig. 2B, inset) and m-GPx4 suddenly drops down at late gestation (between E14.5 and E17.5) and remains low until birth. In contrast, the expression levels of the c-GPx4 isoform remain unchanged. Taken together, these data indicate profound regulatory events in GPx4 expression during late embryogenesis. Localization of phGPx Isoforms in Murine Embryos—To investigate the intraembryonic distribution of GPx4 expression, we performed in situ hybridization using isoformspecific probes for the nuclear (n-GPx4) and the mitochondrial (m-GPx4) isoenzyme (Figs. 3 and 4). In addition, a probe (m+c+n-GPx4) was employed to test total GPx4 expression (Scheme 1C). At early embryonic development (Fig. 3; early bud gastrula E6.5 to late primitive streak embryos E7.5), a similar expression pattern of total GPx4 (m+c+n-GPx4) and m-GPx4 was observed (Fig. 3, A, C, D, and F). The most intense hybridization signals were seen in the ectoplacental cone, the extraembryonic ectoderm, the exocoelomic cavity, and the embryonic epiblast. In this developmental stage, it was impossible to decide whether the m- or the c-GPx4 were dominant at these sites. Using the n-GPx4-specific probe, the hybridization signals were somewhat less intense, suggesting low level expression of this isoform at early developmental stages. At E6.5, n-GPx4 (Fig. 3B) was mainly localized in the yolk sac endoderm, the exocoelomic cavity, and embryonic endoderm (amnion). At a later stage (E7.5), a similar expression pattern was observed, but the signals became even less intense (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that m-GPx4 and c-GPx4 (represented by the probe m+c+n-GPx4) may be of functional relevance during early gastrulation, mainly in ectoplacental and ectodermal tissues. In contrast, the nuclear isoform appears to be involved mainly in endodermal development. In addition, we found strong GPx4 expression (mitochondrial and/or cytosolic isoforms) in the primitive streak (arrows in Fig. 3, D and F) but not in embryonic mesoderm, which prompted us to conclude a function of m- and/or c-GPx4 in early embryonic lineage development.FIGURE 4Expression of GPx4 isoforms in somite stage murine embryos.

Expression of the mitochondrial isoform (m-GPx4) was particularly intense in the head fold region of E8.0 embryos (Fig. 4A) but also throughout the rostral to caudal neural tube at E8.5 (Fig. 4D). A similar hybridization pattern was observed when the m+c+n-probe was used (Fig. 4, C and F). Because of the cross-hybridization properties of the latter probe, it was not possible to distinguish which of the two isoforms (c-GPx4 or m-GPx4) contributed more or less to the total signal intensity. The signals caused by the n-GPx4 probe in the endodermal layers were rather weak (Fig. 4, B and E). Expression of m- and/or c-GPx4 in the differentiating neuroepithelium of the rostral neural tube was extended to the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain at later developmental stages E9.5 and E10.0 (Fig. 4, G, I, J, and L). This stage-dependent expression pattern suggested a role of these isoforms in embryonic brain development. The intensity of the hybridization signals obtained with the probe for the n-GPx4 was rather weak in the developing head fold region and in the tail (Fig. 4, H and K). Expression of Different GPx4 Isoforms during Embryonic Development of Various Organ Systems—Abundant expression of GPx4 isoforms in the developing neuroepithelium (Fig. 4) prompted us to follow the kinetics of GPx4 expression during embryonic cerebral development in more detail. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that cerebral expression of the GPx4 isoforms is characterized by a unique profile (Fig. 5, top). The mRNA concentration for the cytosolic isoform does not undergo major alterations during perinatal brain development (E10.5-N3). In fact, it remains constant at a level of about 100 mRNA copied per 103 copies of GAPDH mRNA. In contrast, the m-GPx4 was expressed at higher levels until E13.5 but then dropped down to lower levels during E14.5-E17.5. Toward birth, expression levels recover, reaching copy numbers of up to 200 per 103 GAPDH copies. A similar transient drop was observed for n-GPx4 during these developmental stages. In contrast, such regulatory kinetics were not observed for other organs, such as the heart (Fig. 5, bottom). Here, we observed constant expression levels o"
https://openalex.org/W1978058355,"Ultraviolet A (UVA, 315-400 nm), constituting about 95% of ultraviolet irradiation in natural sunlight, represents a major environmental challenge to the skin and is clearly associated with human skin cancer. It has proven difficult to show direct actions of UVA as a carcinogen in human cells. Here, we demonstrate that chronic UVA exposures at environmentally relevant doses in vitro can induce malignant transformation of human keratinocytes associated with acquired apoptotic resistance. As evidence of carcinogenic transformation, UVA-long-treated (24 J/cm(2) once/week for 18 weeks) HaCaT (ULTH) cells showed increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9), overexpression of keratin 13, altered morphology and anchorage-independent growth. Malignant transformation was established by the production of aggressive squamous cell carcinomas after inoculation of ULTH cells into nude mice (NC(r)-nu). ULTH cells were resistant to apoptosis induced not only by UVA but also by UVB and arsenite, two other human skin carcinogens. ULTH cells also became resistant to apoptosis induced by etoposide, staurosporine and doxorubicin hydrochloride. Elevated phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB, also called AKT) and reduced expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) were detected in ULTH cells. The resistance of ULTH cells to UVA-induced apoptosis was reversed by either inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) or adenovirus expression of PTEN or dominant negative AKT. These data indicate that UVA has carcinogenic potential in human keratinocytes and that the increased AKT signaling and decreased PTEN expression may contribute to this malignant transformation. Further comparisons between the transformed ULTH and control cells should lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of UVA carcinogenesis and may help identify biomarkers for UVA-induced skin malignancies."

Recent studies have yielded significant insights into the structural basis of substrate recognition and the product specificities of these enzymes. However, the mechanism by which SET domain methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of the methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to the lysine ϵ-amine has remained unresolved. To elucidate this mechanism, we have determined the structures of the plant SET domain enzyme, pea ribulose-1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit methyltransferase, bound to S-adenosyl-l-methionine, and its non-reactive analogs Aza-adenosyl-l-methionine and Sinefungin, and characterized the binding of these ligands to a homolog of the enzyme. The structural and biochemical data collectively reveal that S-adenosyl-l-methionine is selectively recognized through carbon-oxygen hydrogen bonds between the cofactor's methyl group and an array of structurally conserved oxygens that comprise the methyl transfer pore in the active site. Furthermore, the structure of the enzyme co-crystallized with the product ϵ-N-trimethyllysine reveals a trigonal array of carbon-oxygen interactions between the ϵ-ammonium methyl groups and the oxygens in the pore. Taken together, these results establish a central role for carbon-oxygen hydrogen bonding in aligning the cofactor's methyl group for transfer to the lysine ϵ-amine and in coordinating the methyl groups after transfer to facilitate multiple rounds of lysine methylation.

Protein lysine methylation has emerged as a prominent post-translational modification in gene regulatory and intracellular signaling pathways. In the nucleus, site-specific methylation of lysines within histones, transcription factors, and mitotic proteins governs a diverse array of processes within the nucleus including gene expression, DNA damage checkpoint control, cell cycle progression, and mitosis (1Dillon S.C.

In 2000, a breakthrough in our understanding of this modification occurred with the discovery of the first histone-specific protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) 4The abbreviations used are: PKMT, protein lysine methyltransferase; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; CH···O, carbon (hydrogen)-oxygen; dco, carbon-oxygen distance; dH, hydrogen-oxygen distance; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MeLys, ϵ-N-monomethyllysine; Me3Lys, ϵ-N-trimethyllysine; Rubisco, ribulose-1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; LSMT, large subunit N-methyltransferase; aLSMT, A. thaliana Rubisco LSMT; pLSMT, pea Rubisco LSMT. 4The abbreviations used are: PKMT, protein lysine methyltransferase; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; CH···O, carbon (hydrogen)-oxygen; dco, carbon-oxygen distance; dH, hydrogen-oxygen distance; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MeLys, ϵ-N-monomethyllysine; Me3Lys, ϵ-N-trimethyllysine; Rubisco, ribulose-1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; LSMT, large subunit N-methyltransferase; aLSMT, A. thaliana Rubisco LSMT; pLSMT, pea Rubisco LSMT.

These enzymes possess a conserved catalytic SET domain, a 120-residue motif that was named for three Drosophila gene regulatory factors, SU(VAR)3-9, E(Z), and TRX (3Tschiersch B. Hofmann A. Krauss V. Dorn R. Korge G. Reuter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3822-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). This domain shares no apparent sequence or structural homology with other S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent enzymes, establishing the SET domain family as a novel class of methyltransferases. This seminal discovery heralded the identification of a multitude of SET domain PKMTs, which methylate histone and non-histone substrates (1Dillon S.C. Zhang X. Trievel R.C. Cheng X. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 227Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar).Since their identification, crystal structures of several SET domain PKMTs in complex with various substrates and products have been reported, yielding insights into the catalytic mechanism and protein substrate specificity of this methyltransferase family. These structures include the histone methyltransferases SET7/9 (4Jacobs S.A. Harp J.M. Devarakonda S. Kim Y. Rastinejad F. Khorasanizadeh S. Nat. Struct.

Together, these structures have elucidated the SET domain's novel β-sheet architecture, which harbors the AdoMet and protein substrate binding sites. A distinctive feature of this fold is the arrangement of the cofactor and substrate binding clefts, which are located on opposing faces of the SET domain. This configuration differs significantly from other methyltransferases, which generally bind AdoMet and the methyl acceptor in adjoining clefts (15Yeates T.O. Cell. 2002; 111: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Structures of several PKMT ternary complexes have elucidated the path of methyl transfer between the two substrate binding sites (5Xiao B. Jing C. Wilson J.R. Walker P.A. Vasisht N. Kelly G.

The protein substrate intercalates in the substrate binding cleft as parallel β-strand, depositing the lysyl side chain into a narrow hydrophobic channel, which traverses the core of the SET domain. This channel terminates in a narrow aperture, which we refer to as the methyl transfer pore, that opens into the AdoMet binding cleft. During methyl transfer, the cofactor's methyl group is positioned into the pore for the SN2-based transfer reaction with the ϵ-amine group. Thus, the arrangement of the substrate binding sites promotes highly specific protein substrate recognition while permitting mono-, di-, or trimethylation of the lysine ϵ-amine group through iterative rounds of catalysis.Despite the insights obtained from these structural studies, the mechanism by which the methyl group is transferred between the cofactor and lysine binding sites is poorly understood. In prior structural studies of pLSMT, we reported carbon-oxygen (CH···O) hydrogen bonding between the methyl group of N-ϵ-monomethyllysine (MeLys) and a set of structurally conserved oxygen atoms that comprise the methyl transfer pore (13Trievel R.C. Flynn E.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This category of hydrogen bonds can occur when an aliphatic or aromatic carbon atom becomes polarized by an adjacent covalently bonded heteroatom, acidifying the CH hydrogen atoms (16Derewenda Z.S. Lee L. Derewenda U. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 248-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). CH···O hydrogen bonds are estimated to possess half the energy of conventional hydrogen bonds (17Vargas R. Garza J. Dixon D.A. Hay B.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 4750-4755Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar), although recent ab initio calculations suggest that CH groups polarized by neighboring cations can engage hydrogen bonding that is energetically comparable with OH···O interactions (18Scheiner S. Kar T. Gu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9832-9837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).

Based on the structure of the pLSMT-MeLys complex, we proposed that CH···O hydrogen bonding between the methyl transfer pore and mono- and dimethyllysine facilitates subsequent rounds of methylation by orienting the ϵ-amine toward the methyl transfer pore while rotating the existing methyl groups out of the transfer path (13Trievel R.C. Flynn E.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Our initial observation of CH···O hydrogen bonding in the active site of pLSMT prompted us to further examine methyl group interactions in the SET domain, particularly within the methyl transfer pore. To this end, we have determined the structures of pLSMT in complex with AdoMet and its nonreactive analogs Sinefungin (also known as adenosyl-l-ornithine) and AzaAdoMet (see Fig. 1) and quantified the binding of these ligands to a homolog of the enzyme. In addition, we report the structure of pLSMT bound to ϵ-N-trimethyllysine (Me3Lys) and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy), representing the terminal product complex in lysine trimethylation. Taken together, the biochemical and structural data furnish direct evidence for CH···O hydrogen bonding to methyl groups bound within the SET domain and yield mechanistic insights into the catalytic functions of these interactions in PKMTs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagents—S-Adenosyl-l-methionine, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, l-lysine acetate, and Sinefungin were purchased from Sigma, and l-ϵ-monomethyllysine and l-ϵ-trimethyllysine were obtained from Bachem. AdoMet was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography as reported previously (39Chirpich T.P. Zappia V. Costilow R.N. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1778-1789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). l-AzaAdoMet was synthesized and purified according to the method of Thompson et al. (40Thompson M.J. Mekhalfia A. Hornby D.P.

Both aLSMT and pLSMT were overexpressed and purified as reported previously (12Trievel R.C. Beach B.M. Dirk L.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2002; 111: 91-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). After gel filtration purification in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, the proteins were concentrated to ∼50 mg/ml, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Cofactor binding was measured using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal, LLC). Experiments were performed in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl at 20 °C. Due to the aggregation of pLSMT during ITC, titration experiments were performed with aLSMT, a closely related ortholog of pLSMT, which shares an overall sequence identity of 64% with the pea enzyme and is 100% identical in its active site. Titrations were performed with various concentrations of ligand (1.0-5.0 mm) and enzyme (0.1-0.4 μm). Data were then analyzed using Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Corp.) with blank injections of the ligand into the buffer subtracted from the titrations prior to data analysis. All of the calculated binding curves have binding stoichiometries (N-values) between 0.8 and 1.0.

Flynn E.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Crystals were serially dehydrated by increasing the sodium acetate concentration stepwise to 3.0 m, harvested in mother liquor supplemented with 15% 1,2-propanediol, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Oscillation images were collected on a Mar165 CCD detector at the COM-CAT 32-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source Synchrotron, Argonne, IL. Data were integrated and scaled using d*TREK (41Messerschmidt A. Pflugrath J.W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 306-315Crossref Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The structures of the various pLSMT complexes were solved using the pLSMT-AdoHcy-lysine coordinates (1P0Y.pdb) as a starting model (13Trievel R.C. Flynn E.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct.

Simulated annealing Fo - Fc omit maps were calculated in the absence of ligands to accurately model them into the active site in an unbiased manner.

The latter two cofactor analogs were selected for analysis because they possess chemical moieties that differ with respect to the methyl group and sulfonium cation of AdoMet but are otherwise isosteric (Fig. 1). In AzaAdoMet, a tertiary nitrogen is substituted for the AdoMet sulfonium cation, rendering the methyl group inert for transfer. In Sinefungin, a δ-amine and a methylene moiety are incorporated in place of the cofactor's methyl group and sulfonium cation, respectively. The structural variations in these cofactor analogs provide a direct means for thermodynamically quantifying the interactions of distinct chemical groups within the enzyme's methyl transfer pore. Unfortunately, attempts to measure the binding of these ligands to pLSMT were unsuccessful due to its propensity to aggregate during ITC. To circumvent this issue, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) and binding enthalpies (ΔH) using aLSMT, a closely related ortholog of the pea enzyme, which is not prone to aggregation during calorimetry experiments (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2ITC analysis of AdoMet binding to aLSMT. The top panel represents the titration of AdoMet into an aLSMT solution with the heat evolved (μcal/s) plotted versus time (min). The bottom panel illustrates the binding isotherm with the fitted binding curve.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based on our knowledge of the active site, we postulated that Sinefungin would exhibit the greatest affinity for aLSMT due to conventional NH···O hydrogen bonding between the ligand's primary δ-amine group and the oxygens comprising the methyl transfer pore. Surprisingly, AdoMet binds to aLSMT with a 14-fold higher affinity than Sinefungin and exhibits a correspondingly higher enthalpy of binding to the enzyme (Table 1). Due to the isosteric nature of the ligands, these data suggest that the methyl transfer pore preferentially interacts with cofactor's methyl group in comparison with the δ-amine of Sinefungin. Conversely, AzaAdoMet binds over 3000-fold more weakly to aLSMT than AdoMet, indicating that the cofactor's sulfonium cation is essential for high affinity binding to the enzyme. The impaired binding of AzaAdoMet to aLSMT is most likely due to the replacement of the sulfonium group by a tertiary amine (Fig. 1), which exhibits a pH-dependent ionization state (see below). Finally, we measured the binding of AdoHcy to aLSMT and observed that it exhibits an ∼70-fold lower affinity for aLSMT when compared with AdoMet despite the greater binding enthalpy of the product versus the substrate. These differences imply that an entropic penalty is involved in the association of AdoHcy with the enzyme, which may derive from losses in the rotational freedom along the Cγ-Sδ and Sδ-C5′ bonds in the product upon binding. AdoMet does not incur this entropic penalty to the same degree because of the presence of its Cϵ-methyl group, which limits rotation around these bond axes. In summary, these data reveal that AdoMet is selectively recognized by aLSMT through specific interactions with the methyl and sulfonium groups of the cofactor.Structures of pLSMT Bound to AdoMet, AzaAdoMet, and Sinefungin—To elucidate the determinants of cofactor recognition by pLSMT, we have solved the crystal structures of the enzyme bound to AdoMet and its analogs. AdoMet was crystallized in a binary complex with pLSMT, whereas AzaAdoMet and Sinefungin were co-crystallized in ternary complexes with lysine and MeLys, respectively. These free amino acids serve as minimally competent substrates for pLSMT (13Trievel R.C. Flynn E.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and facilitated crystallization of the Sinefungin and AzaAdoMet complexes. The pLSMT binary and ternary complexes crystallized in the same space group with similar unit cell dimensions and three molecules in the asymmetric unit, as reported previously (12Trievel R.C.

This binding mode is structurally conserved in AdoHcy complexes of the enzyme (12Trievel R.C. Beach B.M. Dirk L.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H.

Biol. 2003; 13: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), illustrating that the variations in affinity exhibited by Sinefungin, AzaAdoMet, and AdoMet are not due to overt differences in their respective binding conformations. In the pLSMT-AdoMet complex, the cofactor's methyl group is coordinated in the methyl transfer pore through short distance interactions with the carbonyl oxygens of Ser-221 (3.3 Å) and Asp-239 (3.0 Å) and the hydroxyl group of Tyr-287 (3.3 Å), which is an invariant residue in SET domain PKMTs (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the AzaAdoMet methyl group engages in short range contacts with the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-221 (3.0 Å) and the hydroxyl group of Tyr-287 (3.0 Å) (Fig. 3B). In the Sinefungin complex, the ligand's δ-amine group is bound in the methyl transfer pore through NH···O hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-287 and the carbonyl oxygen of Asp-239, whereas the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-221 is too distant (3.6 Å) to engage conventional hydrogen bonding (Fig. 3C). To ascertain whether short range carbon-oxygen interactions are present in the active sites of other SET domain PKMTs, we examined the 1.7 Å resolution structure of the histone H3 Lys-4-specific methyltransferase SET7/9 bound to AdoMet (6K"
https://openalex.org/W2038906343,"The transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) DEP-1 (density-enhanced phosphatase) is a candidate tumor suppressor in the colon epithelium. We have explored the function of DEP-1 in colon epithelial cells by inducible re-expression in a DEP-1-deficient human colon cancer cell line. Density-enhanced phosphatase-1 re-expression led to profound inhibition of cell proliferation and cell migration, and was associated with cytoskeletal rearrangements. These effects were dependent on the PTP activity of DEP-1 as they were not observed with cells expressing the catalytically inactive DEP-1 C1239S variant. shRNA-mediated suppression of DEP-1 in a colon epithelial cell line with high endogenous DEP-1 levels enhanced proliferation, further supporting the antiproliferative function of DEP-1. Nutrients, which are considered to be chemoprotective with respect to colon cancer development, including butyrate, green tea and apple polyphenols, had the capacity to elevate transcription of endogenous DEP-1 mRNA and expression of DEP-1 protein. Upregulation of DEP-1 expression, and in turn inhibition of cell growth and migration may present a previously unrecognized mechanism of chemoprevention by nutrients."
https://openalex.org/W2147119806,"The crystal structure of AzoR (azoreductase) has been determined in complex with FMN for two different crystal forms at 1.8 and 2.2 A resolution. AzoR is an oxidoreductase isolated from Escherichia coli as a protein responsible for the degradation of azo compounds. This enzyme is an FMN-dependent NADH-azoreductase and catalyzes the reductive cleavage of azo groups by a ping-pong mechanism. The structure suggests that AzoR acts in a homodimeric state forming the two identical catalytic sites to which both monomers contribute. The structure revealed that each monomer of AzoR has a flavodoxin-like structure, without the explicit overall amino acid sequence homology. Superposition of the structures from the two different crystal forms revealed the conformational change and suggested a mechanism for accommodating substrates of different size. Furthermore, comparison of the active site structure with that of NQO1 complexed with substrates provides clues to the possible substrate-binding mechanism of AzoR."
https://openalex.org/W2122398168,"The applicability of tightly regulated transgenesis in domesticated animals is severely hampered by the present lack of knowledge of regulatory mechanisms and the long generation intervals. To capitalize on the tightly controlled expression of mammalian genes made possible by using prokaryotic control elements, we have used a single-step transduction to introduce an autoregulative tetracycline-responsive bicistronic expression cassette (NTA) into transgenic pigs. Transgenic pigs carrying one NTA cassette showed a mosaic transgene expression restricted to single muscle fibers. In contrast, crossbred animals carrying two NTA cassettes with different transgenes, revealed a broad tissue-independent and tightly regulated expression of one cassette, but not of the other one. The expression pattern correlated inversely with the methylation status of the NTA transcription start sites indicating epigenetic silencing of one NTA cassette. This first approach on tetracycline regulated transgene expression in farm animals will be valuable for developing precisely controlled expression systems for transgenes in large animals relevant for biomedical and agricultural biotechnology."
https://openalex.org/W2057607608,"Recently dynein light chain 1 (DLC1), a cytoskeleton signaling component, has been shown to interact with and transactivate estrogen receptor-α (ER), leading to increased expression of ER target genes and growth stimulation of breast cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism by which DLC1 regulates the ER pathway remains poorly understood. To gain insights into the putative mechanism, here we set out to identify novel DLC1-interacting proteins. We identified KIBRA, a WW domain- and a glutamic acid stretch-containing protein, as a DLC1-binding protein and showed that it interacts with DLC1 both in vitro and in vivo. We found that KIBRA-DLC1 complex is recruited to ER-responsive promoters. We also found that KIBRA-DLC1 interaction is mandatory for the recruitment and transactivation functions of ER or DLC1 to the target chromatin. Finally we found that KIBRA interacts with histone H3 via its glutamic acid-rich region and that such interaction might play a mechanistic role in conferring an optimal ER transactivation function as well as the proliferation of ligand-stimulated breast cancer cells.

Despite several advances in diagnosis and therapy, breast cancer remains a significant public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Overwhelming data from clinical and tissue culture model systems suggest that the estrogen pathway plays a crucial role in the development of female breast cancer (1Shao W.L. Brown M. Breast Cancer Res. 2003; 6: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

ER consists of an N-terminal hormone-independent transcriptional AF1 domain, a central DNA-binding domain with two zinc fingers, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain with a hormone-dependent transcriptional AF2 domain (3Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). The classic mechanism of ER activation involves ligand binding leading to the receptor dimerization and direct interaction with estrogen response elements (EREs) in the promoter regions of target genes (4Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Rain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 5Jensen E.V. Jordan V.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1980-1989PubMed Google Scholar). ER also regulates transcription through nonclassic response sites involving other transcription factors, such as Sp1, c-Jun, and AP-1, probably via protein-protein interactions (6Bjornstrom L. Sjoberg M. Nucl. Recept. 2004; 2: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Recently we identified DLC1 as an ER-interacting protein. DLC1, an 8-kDa component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, is highly conserved among species and widely expressed in a number of tissues. In addition to playing an essential role in dynein motor function, DLC1 interacts with a number of proteins of diverse functions. DLC1 is a physiologically interactive substrate of Pak1, and their interaction is essential for the cell survival functions of both Pak1 and DLC1 (7Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore DLC1 up-regulation and its phosphorylation by Pak1 promote the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells. Conditional up-regulation of DLC1 facilitates estrogen-induced ER transactivation, growth stimulation, and anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells (8Rayala S.K. den Hollander P. Balasenthil S. Yang Z. Broaddus R.R. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We discovered that DLC1 is an important mediator of the transactivation functions of ER. In addition, DLC1 expression promoted recruitment of DLC1-ER complex to the ER target gene pS2, whereas DLC1 down-regulation compromised the transactivation function of ER (8Rayala S.K. den Hollander P. Balasenthil S. Yang Z. Broaddus R.R. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).To better understand the molecular mechanism by which DLC1 regulates the ER pathway, we performed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-DLC1 pulldown assay using lysates from exponentially growing ZR-75 breast cancer cells. Precipitated proteins were resolved onto a gel. Sequencing of the proteins in individual bands revealed the presence of a novel DLC1-interacting protein termed KIBRA. KIBRA was originally identified as a dendrin-interacting protein expressed predominantly in kidney and brain (9Kremerskothen J. Plaas C. Buther K. Finger I. Veltel S. Matanis T. Liedtke T. Barnekow A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Buther K. Plaas C. Barnekow A. Kremerskothen J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It contains two N-terminal WW domains, an internal C2-like domain, and a C-terminal region rich in glutamic acids. The WW domain of KIBRA consists of compact protein domains ranging from 35 to 40 amino acids that bind to proline-rich motifs in the target molecules; such domains are found in both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (11Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although WW domain-containing proteins have been implicated in a variety of human diseases (12Bednarek A.K. Laflin K.J. Daniel R.L. Liao Q.Y. Hawkins K.A. Aldaz C.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2140-2145PubMed Google Scholar), the functional importance of such proteins (e.g. KIBRA) for the interaction with DLC1 remains unknown.Here we show that KIBRA directly binds to DLC1 and that it is a downstream mediator of the regulation of ER transactivation by DLC1. We also show that KIBRA by itself is a co-activator of ER. These co-activator functions of KIBRA and DLC1 are dependent on interactions between the two proteins that involve histone H3 via the glutamic acid-rich region of KIBRA. Together our findings reveal a previously unknown connection between KIBRA, DLC1, and ER responsiveness and the existence of a regulatory pathway between histone H3-interacting KIBRA and ER via DLC1 that optimally stimulates the growth of breast cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Reagents—Human breast cancer cells and other cancer cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MCF-7/DLC-1 Tet-On cells expressing T7-DLC1 were maintained in 5% tetracycline-free serum in RPMI 1640 medium (8Rayala S.K. den Hollander P. Balasenthil S. Yang Z. Broaddus R.R. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). DLC1 was induced by adding 10 μg/ml of doxycycline for 24 h. Antibodies against DLC1, T7, Cyclin D1, BCL-2, and Myc tag were purchased from BD Biosciences, Novagen (Milwaukee, WI), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dako, and Neomarkers (Fremont, CA), respectively.Identification of New Binding Partners of DLC1—Immunoprecipitation experiments to identify novel DLC1-interacting partners were performed by adding GST-DLC1 to the total cell lysates from ZR-75 cells. The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm sodium vanadate). The experiment was performed by adding equal amounts (35 μg) of GST and GST-DLC1 proteins immobilized on GST beads (Amersham Biosciences) to an equal amount (7 mg) of ZR-75 cell lysate. The new binding partners were then isolated by incubating the mixture overnight at 4 °C and washing them three times with the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The proteins were eluted with 2× SDS buffer. The precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue dye. Several distinct bands were cut from the gel and digested, the peptides were then sequenced, and the sequences were mapped against known proteins and DNA sequences.Transfection, Cell Growth, and Protein Assays—Stable cell lines were generated by transfecting MCF-7 cells with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA-T7-KIBRA. After 48 h, cells were selected in medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml). Transient transfection studies were performed using a FuGENE 6 kit (Roche Applied Science) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. β-Galactosidase reporter activity was used as a measure of transfection efficiency. For cell growth assays, cells were grown in phenol red-free medium supplemented with 3% charcoal-stripped serum in 6-well plates with or without 1 nm estradiol. Cells were trypsinized and counted with a Coulter counter at indicated time points. For Western blotting and immunoprecipitation studies, cell lysates in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer were resolved on 18% Tricine gels (for DLC1) and 8% gels for all other proteins of interest.Subcellular Protein Extraction—ZR-75 cellular components were sequentially extracted using a widely adopted biochemical fractionation and sequential extraction procedure as described earlier (22Nair S.S. Mishra S.K. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6416-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) as “soluble” (with Nonidet P-40 buffer), “cytoskeletal/nucleoplasm-associated” (with Triton X-100), and “chromatin-associated” (with DNase treatment) protein fractions. The presence of KIBRA in individual fractions was confirmed by Western blot analysis with a KIBRA-specific antibody (9Kremerskothen J. Plaas C. Buther K. Finger I. Veltel S. Matanis T. Liedtke T. Barnekow A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Northern Blotting and RNA Interference—Northern blotting analysis was performed as described previously (13Rayala S.K. Mascarenhas J. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). SMART POOL siRNA for DLC1 was synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). For knockdown of KIBRA expression, four sets of siRNAs (Qiagen Biosciences, Germantown, MD) targeting human KIBRA sequences were used. Of these four sets, set 3 worked the best.The sequences for set 3 were sense r(CCGCUCACCUUUGCUGACU)d(TT) and antisense –r(AGUCAGCAAAGGUGAGCGG)d(TT). A commercially available nonspecific random siRNA was used as a control (Dharmacon). Transfection of siRNA was performed as described previously (14Rayala S.K. Talukder A.H. Balasenthil S. Tharakan R. Barnes C.J. Wang R.A. Aldaz M. Khan S. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1694-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Cloning of KIBRA Deletion Constructs—T7-KIBRA and GST-tagged KIBRA were generated in pcDNA3.1C and PGEX vectors, respectively. To map the binding sites of KIBRA on histone H3 we generated deletion constructs of KIBRA. To generate T7-KIBRA ΔEEE mutant, the codon for leucine, GAA at 838, was mutated to a stop codon such as TAA using pcDNA-KIBRA as a template by site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX).GST Pulldown Assays and Far Western Analysis—In vitro transcription and translation of the histone H3 and KIBRA proteins were performed using the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (15Rayala S.K. den Hollander P. Balasenthil S. Molli P.R. Bean A.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4395-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Far Western analysis for histones was performed as described earlier (22Nair S.S. Mishra S.K. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6416-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as described previously (8Rayala S.K. den Hollander P. Balasenthil S. Yang Z. Broaddus R.R. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Formaldehyde was added at a final concentration of 1% directly to the tissue culture medium. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), lysed with buffer containing 1% SDS, and sonicated. Equal amounts of DNA were used for each sample and diluted with chromatin dilution buffer containing 0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture. For input DNA, 1% of the chromatin solution was kept aside before immunoprecipitation. Chromatin solutions were immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 antibody at 4 °C overnight. Beads bound with immunoprecipitates were washed on a rotating platform before eluting the antibody-bound chromatin by incubation with 400 μl of 1% SDS containing 0.1 m NaHCO3. The eluate and the input chromatin were heated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-link in the presence of 200 mm NaCl, and RNA was removed by the addition of RNase. The samples were then digested with proteinase K and subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction. The supernatant was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 30 μl of water. PCR analysis was performed with primers for the pS2 gene, which encompasses the ERE (pS2), or 1 kb upstream of this element to serve as negative control (pS2 upstream), 3μl of sample DNA, and 1 μl of input DNA. The PCR was restricted to 30 cycles. Our pS2 gene primers amplified the region inclusive of the ER-responsive element from –463 to –159. The pS2 upstream primers amplified the region from –1953 to –1651. The PR gene primers amplified the region including the ERE from +90 to +310. PCR products (304, 302, and 220 bp, respectively) were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. The sequences of the pS2 promoter primers used in this study were 5′-GAATTAGCTTAGGCCTAGACGGAATG-3′ and 5′-AGGATTTGCTGATAGACAGAGACGAC3′. For the element upstream of the ER element in the pS2 gene promoter, the primers were 5′-CTCCCTCTTCAGGCCTCTCT-3′ and 5′-TTCCCTGGTGTTGTCAAGTG-3′, and for the progesterone receptor gene element, the primers were 5′-GGCTTTGGGCGGGGCCTCCCTA-3′ and 5′-TCTGCTGGCTCCGTACTGCGG-3′.RESULTSIdentification of KIBRA as a DLC1-interacting Protein—To better understand the cellular functions of DLC1 in ER-responsive breast cancer cells, we set out to identify novel DLC1-interacting proteins using the modified proteomic strategy. This analysis identified several previously known DLC1-binding partners as well as several new DLC1-binding proteins, including a previously identified cytoplasmic protein named KIBRA with no assigned function (Fig. 1A) (GenBank™ accession number NP_056053) (9Kremerskothen J. Plaas C. Buther K. Finger I. Veltel S. Matanis T. Liedtke T. Barnekow A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).KIBRA Interacts with DLC1—To demonstrate an in vivo interaction of KIBRA and DLC1 in breast cancer cells, we transiently transfected Myc-tagged KIBRA and control cytomegalovirus vector in MCF-7 cells. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody followed by immunoblotting with a DLC1 monoclonal antibody showed specific interaction of Myc-KIBRA and endogenous DLC1 (Fig. 1B). Similarly cell lysates from well characterized MCF-7/T7-DLC1 clones (8Rayala S.K. den Hollander P. Balasenthil S. Yang Z. Broaddus R.R. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were immunoprecipitated with T7-DLC1 and analyzed by Western blotting with T7 or KIBRA antibody (9Kremerskothen J. Plaas C. Buther K. Finger I. Veltel S. Matanis T. Liedtke T. Barnekow A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly KIBRA-DLC1 interaction was enhanced upon stimulation with epidermal growth factor or serum (Fig. 1C). Together these results show that KIBRA interacts with DLC1 in vivo. To determine the direct interaction between KIBRA and DLC1, we next examined the ability of in vitro translated [35S]KIBRA protein to bind with a GST-DLC1 fusion protein. KIBRA interacted efficiently with GST-DLC1 but not with GST alone in GST pulldown assays (Fig. 1D). Upon careful analysis of the protein sequence of KIBRA, we detected a nuclear localization signal (amino acids 361KWTQGEVEQLEMARKR376). Based on this information, we wished to determine the localization of KIBRA in the cell. Biochemical fractionation of breast cancer cells showed that, although KIBRA was predominantly found in the cytoplasmic fraction, a substantial amount of KIBRA was also present in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1E).Differential extraction of subcellular proteins and immunoblotting with KIBRA-specific antibody showed that KIBRA was present in almost all of the subcellular fractions. These results demonstrated that KIBRA could be localized in the nuclear compartment and thus raised the possibility that it may be involved in transcriptional modulation. At least two KIBRA bands of different mobility could be detected in the Western blot analysis (Fig. 1F) presumably due to different phosphorylated forms of KIBRA. Of interest, KIBRA existed as a single band in the chromatin fraction (Fig. 1F, lane 4). Further in vivo labeling with orthophosphoric acid revealed that KIBRA is a phosphoprotein (data not shown).KIBRA Potentiates ER Transactivation—The observed interaction of KIBRA with DLC1 and the fact that DLC1 interacts with ER (8Rayala S.K. den Hollander P. Balasenthil S. Yang Z. Broaddus R.R. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), raised the possibility that KIBRA might be involved in the ER pathway. To explore this notion, we examined the ability of KIBRA to influence the transcription of an ERE-luciferase reporter system in MCF-7 and ZR-75 breast cancer cells. Co-expression of KIBRA potentiated the ability of ligand-activated ER to stimulate ERE-driven transcription (Fig. 2A). Pre-treatment of MCF-7 cells with the pure antiestrogen compound ICI182780 completely blocked this potentiating effect of estrogen (Fig. 2B). The expression of KIBRA alone also had a modest but reproducible stimulatory effect on reporter activity in the absence of estrogen. Because we initially identified KIBRA as a DLC1-interacting protein, we next examined whether DLC1 and KIBRA could cooperate in stimulating the transactivating ability of ER. Using MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we found that DLC1 enhanced the stimulatory effect of KIBRA on ERE-luciferase activity (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2KIBRA overexpression potentiates basal as well as E2-mediated stimulation of ERE-luc activity. A, MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells were co-transfected with KIBRA or cytomegalovirus (CMV) along with ERE-luc and treated with E2 for 24 h, and ERE-luc activity was measured. B, MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with KIBRA or cytomegalovirus along with ERE-luc. After 24 h, cells were treated with 10–9 m E2 or E2 and 10–8 m ICI182780 (ICI), and luc activity was measured after 24 h. C, KIBRA potentiated ER transactivation functions of DLC1.

We examined the effect of estrogen on the transactivation activity of ER in these stable clones and as observed previously (Fig. 2A) found that KIBRA promoted the ability of ER to stimulate ERE-luciferase activity in these clones (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3KIBRA induced ER target genes by its recruitment to the target DNA.

The results showed that KIBRA enhanced both basal and estrogen-induced levels of Cyclin D1, BCL-2, and pS2 (Fig. 3, C and D), thus implicating KIBRA in the potentiation of estrogen-sensitive transcription and consequently the steady-state expression of the ER target genes. To further elucidate the role of KIBRA in ER target gene expression, we next determined whether KIBRA is recruited to the pS2 promoter using ChIP assays. PCR analysis of coimmunoprecipitated DNA revealed that T7-KIBRA was recruited to the pS2 gene chromatin at the estrogen response element and not to the chromatin 1 kb upstream and that this specific recruitment was enhanced upon estrogen stimulation of the KIBRA-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3E). To show KIBRA recruitment to other estrogen-inducible genes, we performed a PCR analysis of the progesterone receptor gene and were able to show the same recruitment pattern for the ERE on PR. The observed promotion of ER target gene expression in estrogen-stimulated cells has functional implications because estrogen stimulated the growth of MCF-7/KIBRA cells more effectively than it stimulated the growth of MCF-7/pcDNA cells (Fig. 3F). Together these observations suggested a role for KIBRA in promoting the expression of ER target genes as well as the proliferation of ligand-stimulated breast cancer cells.KIBRA Regulation of ER Transactivation Functions Requires DLC1—Because we identified KIBRA as a DLC1-interacting protein and because co-expression of DLC1 further elevated the levels of ERE-driven transcription by KIBRA (Fig. 2C), we hypothesized that DLC1 might be involved in the action of KIBRA on the ER pathway. To explore this concept, we first knocked down the endogenous DLC1 with specific siRNA and performed a ChIP assay in the KIBRA-overexpressing cells. We found that KIBRA from such cells was unable to interact with pS2 gene chromatin upon estrogen stimulation (Fig. 4A). To show that the failure of KIBRA recruitment to the target chromatin, by knocking down DLC1, translates into a reduced ER transactivation activity, we next performed a luciferase assay under the same conditions. Interestingly we found that down-regulation of DLC1 expression drastically reduced the potentiating effect of KIBRA on ER transactivation under both basal and estrogen-stimulated conditions (Fig. 4B). Together these observations suggested an essential role for DLC1 in the ability of KIBRA to stimulate the transactivating function of ER.FIGURE 4DLC1 is required for ER transactivation functions of KIBRA.

Balasenthil S. Yang Z. Broaddus R.R. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and because DLC1 interacts with KIBRA, we hypothesized that KIBRA might also be important in mediating the effects of DLC1 upon ER transactivation function. To investigate this notion, we used KIBRA-specific siRNA to knock down the expression of endogenous KIBRA. We screened four KIBRA-specific siRNAs for their ability to knock down KIBRA expression and identified the most effective as siRNA set 3 (Fig. 5A). To delineate the molecular basis for the role of KIBRA in the function of DLC1, we performed ChIP analysis on MCF-7/DLC1 Tet-On cells (8Rayala S.K. den Hollander P. Balasenthil S. Yang Z. Broaddus R.R. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in which the endogenous KIBRA expression has been knocked down. As expected, DLC1 overexpression was accompanied by increased recruitment of T7-DLC1 to the pS2 promoter in the DLC1-stable clones compared with non-induced cells (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4 versus lanes 1 and 2) and not to the chromatin 1 kb upstream of the ERE in the pS2 promoter. Interestingly, however, the increased recruitment of T7-DLC1 to the pS2 promoter was lost in estrogen-treated cultures (compare lane 6 with lane 4) after knocking down KIBRA, suggesting an obligatory role for KIBRA in the DLC1 regulation of ER-targeted gene expression. To show a functional consequence of the derecruitment of DLC1 by knocking down KIBRA, we performed a luciferase assay under the same experimental conditions. The results showed that elimination of KIBRA impaired the ability of DLC1 to stimulate both basal and estrogen-induced ER transactivation function (Fig. 5, C and D). To evaluate the biological functionality of these molecular effects of KIBRA, we next showed that down-regulation of KIBRA express"

Shroom regulates this process by causing apical constriction of epithelial cells via a pathway involving myosin II. Here we report on characterization of the Shroom-related proteins Apxl and KIAA1202 and their role in cell architecture. Shroom, Apxl, and KIAA1202 exhibit differing abilities to interact with the actin cytoskeleton.

To determine whether the activity of Shroom-like proteins is conserved in invertebrates, we have tested the ability of the lone Shroomrelated protein in Drosophila, CG8603, to activate the constriction pathway. A chimeric protein consisting of the Shroom targeting domain and the Drosophila protein elicits constriction.

Virtually all cells, regardless of their evolutionary history, exhibit some capacity to regulate their architecture in a way that is critical to proper growth and survival. In animal cells, the integrated actions of the microtubule, intermediate filament, and actin cytoskeletons, in conjunction with an array of adhesion receptors, are responsible for determining many of the architectural properties of cells and tissues. Whereas the selfassembling, filamentous nature of these protein networks makes them ideally suited for conveying certain physiological characteristics, it is the assortment of associated proteins that are responsible for regulating their stability, dynamics, higher order organization, and subcellular distribution (1.Fuchs E.

Biol. 2003; 13: 2125-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This function is essential for neural tube closure in both mouse and Xenopus embryos, as deficiency in Shrm results in exencephaly and spina bifida (5.Haigo S.L. Hildebrand J.D. Harland R.M.

Shrm appears both necessary and sufficient for the recruitment or maintenance of an actomyosin network in the AJC of neural epithelial cells (4.Hildebrand J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5191-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In mice and humans, the Shrm family of proteins consists of Shrm, Apxl, and Kiaa1202 (6.Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Cell. 1999; 99: 486-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 7.Schiaffino M.V. Bassi M.T. Rugarli E.I. Renieri A. Galli L. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol.

This family is defined by the arrangement of at least two of three conserved sequence motifs. Shrm, Kiaa1202, and Apxl all contain an N-terminal PDZ domain and a C-terminal motif termed ASD2 (Apx/Shrm domain 2). Apxl and Shrm also contain a centrally located motif termed ASD1 (6.Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Cell. 1999; 99: 486-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Based on the analysis of Shrm, ASD1 is an actin binding motif that regulates subcellular localization and ASD2 regulates apical constriction. The activity of Shrm is dependent on ASD1 and ASD2 working in cis. To date, the ASD1 and ASD2 elements have only been found in Shrm-related proteins and do not appear in combination with other conserved domains as is observed for many other defined protein modules (such as PDZ, SH2, SH3, and PH domains). Here we show that Shrm, Apxl, and Kiaa1202 have both shared and unique cellular and biochemical properties. Whereas wild-type Apxl and Kiaa1202 are unable to induce apical constriction, they have the innate capacity to do so, as targeting their ASD2 motifs to the AJC results in constriction. The intrinsic functional differences between Shrm, Apxl, and Kiaa1202 are regulated by variations in subcellular localization that are conferred by association with distinct compartments of the actin cytoskeleton. We further demonstrate that Apxl colocalizes with non-muscle myosin II and may function to regulate endothelial cell morphology during processes involving dynamic actin organization. We also present evidence that the Shrm pathway may be conserved in invertebrate organisms. Thus, we predict that these proteins utilize a common mechanism to regulate diverse cellular processes, and that their activities are temporally and spatially controlled by differential actin binding. Additionally, we suggest that this pathway has been conserved throughout metazoan evolution. Molecular Biology—Two overlapping λ clones encompassing the entire open reading frame of mouse Apxl were isolated from a mouse brain cDNA library (Stratagene) and assembled into a complete cDNA encoding Apxl (GenBank™ DQ358971). Portions of Apxl were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCS3mt expression vector in-frame with the Myc tags. For bacterial expression of Apxl proteins, portions of the cDNA encoding amino acids 513-880 or 878-1287 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGex3X. The cDNAs for CG8603 (GenBank NM137108) and human KIAA1202 (GenBank NM020717) were obtained from the BDGP (Bloomington) and the Riken Corporation (Japan), respectively. To generate vectors expressing ShrmSΔASD2 and the various Shrm chimeric proteins, pCS2-ShrmS (6.Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Cell. 1999; 99: 486-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (281) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI to remove the portion of the cDNA encoding amino acids 1572-1986 (encompassing ASD2) either religated (for ShrmSΔASD2) or ligated to DNA fragments encoding amino acids 1068-1480, 1054-1502, and 237-667 of mApxl, hKIAA1202, or CG8603, respectively, that had been amplified by PCR and digested with EcoRI. Antibody Production and Protein Expression—Antibodies to Shrm (UPT120 and UPT132) have been described previously (4.Hildebrand J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5191-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 5.Haigo S.L. Hildebrand J.D. Harland R.M. Wallingford J.B. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2125-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Apxl-specific sera (UPT115) was generated in rabbits using an antigen consisting of amino acids 878-1287 fused to GST. Specific antibodies were affinity purified using the same antigen coupled to Sepharose. A region of Apxl encoding the localization domain (amino acids 513-880) was expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose. Briefly, expression of GST-Apxl was induced for 3 h by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm final concentration) to log phase cells growing at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in NETN (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture, and lysed by sonication. Cleared bacterial lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4°C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed extensively with NETN followed by TBS. GST-Apxl was eluted with free glutathione. Concentration and protein integrity were determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. His-tagged Shrm was generated by cloning the portion of the mouse Shrm cDNA encoding amino acids 754-1108 into pQE32. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to log phase BL21 E. coli to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Bacteria were grown overnight at 22 °C, pelleted, and lysed by sonication. His-tagged protein was purified under native conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Western Blotting and Actin Binding—Purified His-Shrm or GST-Apxl were added to polymerized F-actin (0.08 μm) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. For co-sedimentation assays, F-actin was pelleted at 100,000 × g in an Airfuge. The pellets were resuspended in a volume equal to the supernatant fraction, and equal volumes of the pellet and supernatant fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For EM analysis of actin bundles, Shrm-induced actin bundles were spotted onto grids, negatively stained, and observed by transmission electron microscopy. Alternatively, Shrm-actin complexes were pelleted at 14,000 × g in a Microfuge. Pellet fractions were resuspended in sample buffer to a final volume equal to that of the supernatant fractions. Equal volumes of pellet and supernatant fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Endogenous Apxl was detected by Western blotting using affinity purified UPT115 diluted 1:500 in TBST + 4% milk. Lysate from embryonic day (e) 10.5 mouse embryos was generated by homogenizing embryos in RIPA buffer (+protease inhibitors) with a Dounce homogenizer at 4 °C. Apxl was precipitated from 1 ml (1 mg/ml) of lysate with UPT115 and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4°C with constant rocking. Immune complexes were washed with RIPA buffer and TBS and resuspended in Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Total lysate or immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Proteins were detected by UPT115 diluted 1:500 in TBST. Primary antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:2,500 in TBST and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Ectopically expressed Apxl proteins, Kiaa1202, and CG8603 were detected by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody 9E10 (anti-Myc) diluted 1:200 in TBST + 4% milk. Shrm chimeric proteins were detected using the Shrm-specific polyclonal antibody UPT120 raised to amino acids 754-1108 of mouse Shrm. Cell Culture—T23 MDCK and C166 endothelial cells (9.Wang S.J. Greer P. Auerbach R. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1996; 32: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Rat1 fibroblasts and CtBP90 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells growing on coverslips or Transwell filters were transfected with 1-2 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). For drug treatments, cells were treated with either Me2SO (vehicle) or ± blebbistatin (100 μg/ml, CalBiochem) for 90 min. For adhesion assays, cells were removed from plates with trypsin, washed in soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml, Sigma), resuspended in serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium, and plated onto fibronectincoated coverslides (3 μg/cm2, Sigma). In some cases, cells were first transfected with Apxl expression vectors and grown for 18 h prior to plating onto fibronectin. Immunocytochemistry—Cells growing on coverslips or Transwell filters were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in either methanol (-20 °C) for 5 min or 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeablized with 0.2% Triton (in PBS) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were stained for 1 h at room temperature with the following primary antibodies diluted in PBT (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20): rat anit-ZO-1 (1:400, Chemicon), mouse anti-E-cadherin, mouse anti-β-catenin, rat anti-PECAM (1:400, BD Pharmingen), rabbit anti-di-phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain (1:200, Cell Signaling), and mouse anti-non-muscle myosin II (1:400, clone CMII23, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Cells were washed three times for 5 min each at room temperature. Cells were then stained with secondary antibodies diluted in PBT for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed as above and mounted on microscope slides with Vectashield (Vector Labs). Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488, Alexa 568, or Alexa 633 conjugated to goat anti-rabbit, mouse, or rat IgG (Molecular Probes). TRITC-phalloidin was used to detect F-actin (Sigma). For staining sections, embryos or adult tissues were isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1-3 h (depending on the size of the sample) at 4 °C. Samples were washed extensively in cold PBS, equilibrated in 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C, embedded in OCT, and stored at -80 °C. Samples were processed at -20 °C using a Leica cryostat and ribbons of 8-μm sections were placed on glass slides. Sections were equilibrated in PBS, blocked with PBT, 2% goat serum for 30 min, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. Sections were washed at room temperature in PBT for 15 min with constant rocking and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in secondary antibody or TRITC-phalloidin diluted in blocking buffer. Slides were washed and mounted using Vectashield. Images were acquired using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 Laser Scanning System mounted on a Nikon E800 microscope (×40 or 60 oil objectives). Collected images were processed using Adobe Photoshop and NIH Image. For cellular measurements, NIH Image was used to measure the area of a cell outlined by E-cadherin staining at the basal surface (a distance of 1.5 μm from the filter) and the AJC (as defined by the distribution of ZO-1). Expression of Apxl in Vivo—To investigate the role of Shroom-related proteins in development, we cloned the fulllength coding sequence for mouse Apxl and characterized the protein encoded by the cDNA. Apxl encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 165 kDa. Comparison of the predicted protein sequence of Shrm and Apxl shows that it contains the N-terminal PDZ domain and the Shrm family-specific sequence motifs Apx/Shrm domain 1 (ASD1) and Apx/Shrm domain 2 (ASD2) located in the central and C-terminal regions of the protein, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1). To further characterize Apxl, Western blots were performed using affinity purified antibodies to a non-conserved region of Apxl. Apxl antibodies detect a protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼200 kDa in both total lysate and immunoprecipitations using lysate derived from e10.5 mouse embryos (Fig. 1A). To determine what cell types express Apxl and where it is distributed within those cells during vertebrate development, frozen sections of e10.5 mouse embryos were stained to detect Apxl. Apxl is predominantly expressed in cells that exhibit polarized growth, including the vasculature and multiple epithelial populations (Fig. 1B). To verify the distribution of Apxl in the vasculature, sections were co-stained to detect Apxl and PECAM, a marker of vascular endothelial cells (Fig. 1C). Apxl and PECAM are expressed in the same cells and exhibit significant co-distribution, suggesting that Apxl may associate with PECAM-based adhesion structures. In most populations of epithelial cells, including gut and neural epithelium (Fig. 1, D and E, respectively), Apxl is localized to the putative AJC or tight junctions. Because the founding member of this protein family, Apx, was identified in Xenopus kidney cells (10.Staub O. Verrey F. Kleyman T.R. Benos D.J. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbuhl J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we assessed the expression of Apxl in adult kidney by staining frozen sections. Apxl is expressed in kidney tubules and exhibits a unique distribution in these cells relative to other epithelial cells, such that it is associated with the apical plasma membrane (Fig. 1F). In humans, APXL has been linked to the human disease ocular albinism due to its genomic location on the X-chromosome (7.Schiaffino M.V. Bassi M.T. Rugarli E.I. Renieri A. Galli L. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In mice, Apxl is expressed in the cell junctions of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) in e15.5 mouse embryos (Fig. 1, G-I). Western blot analysis indicates that many adult tissues express Apxl, however, based on immunohistochemistry, a majority of this Western blot signal appears to be contributed by the associated vasculature (not shown). To more carefully investigate the distribution of Apxl we looked at its subcellular localization in mouse embryo fibroblasts that exhibit epithelial characteristic due to mutations in Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 (CtBP90 cells (11.Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5296-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)). In confluent cells, Apxl is localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1J). Apxl is localized to the plasma membrane in sparsely plated cells as well, suggesting that its localization is independent of cell-cell adhesion (Fig. 1K). Ectopically expressed Apxl exhibits a subcellular distribution that is similar that of endogenous Apxl. In fibroblasts, Apxl is seen at the plasma membrane with cortical actin (Fig. 1L). In MDCK cells, a population of Apxl is localized to the AJC as defined by ZO-1 distribution (Fig. 1M). The distribution of Apxl in tight junctions in MDCK cells appears somewhat inefficient when compared with its recruitment to these structures in vivo (Fig. 1, D and E). This could be a function of overexpression or result from a mechanism that regulates Apxl localization in vivo that is not present in MDCK cells grown in vitro. The distribution we observe is somewhat inconsistent with that described previously, where Apxl appears to be largely perinuclear with some being localized to the cell membrane and the apical domain (12.Raychowdhury M.K. Ibarra C. Damiano A. Jackson Jr., G.R. Smith P.R. McLaughlin M. Prat A.G. Ausiello D.A. Lader A.S. Cantiello H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20137-20146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This discrepancy might be due to the fact that the antibodies used in that study were directed to a related protein from Xenopus, Apx, which is not the mouse ortholog of Apxl. Mapping the Functional Sequences of Apxl—We next wanted to determine what region of Apxl mediates its localization in both fibroblast and epithelial cells. To accomplish this, we generated vectors for expressing various portions of Apxl in cells (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis indicates that the expressed proteins are of the predicted size (Fig. 2B). To assay localization, these proteins were transiently expressed in either Rat1 fibroblasts (Fig. 2) or polarized MDCK epithelial cells (Fig. 3) and their distribution examined by immunofluorescence. In Rat1 cells, proteins containing either the N-terminal PDZ-(1-513) or C-terminal ASD2-(880-1481) motif localize to the cytoplasm, suggesting that these sequences play little role in mediating localization to cortical actin (Fig. 2, D and H, respectively). In contrast, the centrally located ASD1 sequence motif appears to mediate targeting to cortical actin, as all of the proteins that contain it (1-880, 513-880, and 513-1481) localize to cortical actin (Fig. 2, E-G). These results are similar to what has been observed for Shrm, where ASD1 is necessary and sufficient for targeting Shrm to actin stress fibers (6.Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Cell. 1999; 99: 486-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (281) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Domain mapping Apxl in MDCK epithelial cells. A-F, indicated Myc-tagged Apxl proteins were transiently expressed in MDCK cells and the cells were stained to detect exogenous Apxl using 9E10 (green) or the tight junction protein ZO-1 (red). The individual fluorescent signals for the Apxl proteins are shown in A′-F′. Optimal localization of Apxl to the AJC appears to require both the PDZ domain and ASD1. Arrowheads denote localization in the AJC. Scale bar equals 15 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A different result is observed when these proteins are expressed in polarized MDCK cells. In these cells, optimal localization of Apxl appears to require both the PDZ domain and ASD1. In contrast to what is seen in fibroblasts, the protein containing the PDZ domain (1-513) shows limited co-localization with ZO-1 in tight junctions (Fig. 3B), whereas any protein lacking the PDZ domain (513-880, 513-1481, or 880-1481) is found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, D-F, respectively). However, optimal localization seems to require both the PDZ domain and ASD1, as a protein containing both of these motifs (1-880, Fig. 3C) exhibits efficient localization to the tight junction. This truncated protein appears to localize even more efficiently than full-length Apxl (Fig. 3, A versus C). This mechanism of localization is different from Shrm, where the PDZ domain plays no role in mediating localization to the AJC and is dispensable for regulating apical constriction (see below, Figs. 5 and 6). The increased localization of the N terminus of Apxl in comparison to the full-length protein (Fig. 3, A versus C) suggests that there may be some form of intramolecular interaction that regulates its localization under certain physiological conditions. This may also account for the observed differences in the efficiency in the targeting between the endogenous protein in vivo and the exogenous protein in vitro.FIGURE 6Conserved activity of ASD2 in Shrm family proteins. Indicated Shrm, Shrm-related, and chimeric proteins were expressed in MDCK cells growing on Transwell filters and the cells were stained to detect the exogenous protein (UPT120 or 9E10, green) and ZO-1 (red). ShrmS and chimeric proteins containing the N-terminal half of Shrm all cause apical constriction (arrows), whereas other Shrm-related proteins and the Apxl-Shrm chimeric proteins do not. In panel L, transfected cells expressing Shrm-Apxl were treated with blebbistatin for 90 min prior to staining.

Soriano P. Cell. 1999; 99: 486-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Because Apxl localizes with actin and ASD1 appears to mediate this distribution, we tested if Apxl localization is regulated by a direct interaction with F-actin. The membrane distribution of Apxl is dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton, as treatment of cells with cytochalasin D perturbs Apxl localization (Fig. 4, A and B). Following drug treatment, Apxl and actin remain co-localized in discrete puncta, suggesting that Apxl and actin are in a complex (Fig. 4B, inset). To determine whether Apxl directly binds F-actin, the region of Apxl that contains ASD1 and localizes to cortical actin in Rat1 fibroblasts (513-880) was expressed and purified from E. coli and assayed by F-actin co-sedimentation. In these experiments, GST-Apxl-(513-880) is found in the pellet fraction with F-actin (Fig. 4C). These data provide further evidence that ASD1 from both Shrm and Apxl play a similar role in mediating subcellular localization via direct binding to F-actin. Co-sedimentation of Apxl is not due to nonspecific trapping, as an unrelated Apxl protein, Apxl-(878-1287) does not co-sediment with F-actin to any appreciable level. Unlike Apxl, Shrm localizes with actin stress fibers in vivo and causes them to form bundles when expressed in Rat1 fibroblasts (Fig. 4D). Either full-length Shrm or a portion of Shrm containing ASD1 (amino acids 754-1108) display this activity (Fig. 4E). To assess the direct impact of Shrm on actin organization, we purified the actin-binding domain of Shrm, mixed it with F-actin, and visualized the Shrm-actin complexes by electron microscopy. The addition of Shrm causes actin to form tightly packed bundles, consistent with what is seen in vivo (Fig. 4F). The addition of Shrm to F-actin also allows for sedimentation of F-actin at low speed, consistent with the notion that Shrm bundles actin filaments (not shown). The actin-binding domain of Apxl exhibits no bundling activity in these assays (not shown). Thus, whereas both Shrm and Apxl utilize a similar sequence motif to bind F-actin in vitro, the proteins interact with distinct populations of F-actin in vivo and have differing abilities to organize actin into higher order structures. We predict that the differential nature of actin binding is a critical aspect of regulating the in vivo function of Shrm, Apxl, and other related family members (see below). Differential Localization Modulates the Activity of Shrm Family Proteins—The ability of Shrm to cause constriction is dependent on both the correct subcellular localization and the presence of ASD2 at the C terminus (4.Hildebrand J.D.

Biol. 2003; 13: 2125-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). ASD2 is the most highly conserved sequence element shared by Shrm, Apx, Apxl, and KIAA1202 in vertebrates (6.Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P.

Based on the observation that ASD2 mediates constriction and this is the most highly conserved domain, we looked for genes in Drosophila that encode proteins that are similar to ASD2. This analysis identified a single gene, CG8603, that shares similarity to Shrm. Whereas there is no defined function for CG8603, it has been reported that overexpressing this open reading frame increases longevity (13.Seong K.H. Ogashiwa T. Matsuo T. Fuyama Y. Aigaki T.

https://openalex.org/W2082293650,"Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is thought to exert antiapoptotic effects in cancer. Here we show that the tumor suppressor p53 upregulated Cox-2 in esophageal and colon cancer cell lines by inducing the binding of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) to its response element in the COX-2 promoter. Inhibition of NF-kappaB prevented p53 induction of Cox-2 expression. Cooperation between p53 and NF-kappaB was required for activation of COX-2 promoter in response to daunomycin, a DNA-damaging agent. Pharmacological inhibition of Cox-2 enhanced apoptosis in response to daunomycin, in particular in cells containing active p53. In esophageal cancer, there was a correlation between Cox-2 expression and wild-type TP53 in Barrett's esophagus (BE) and in adenocarcinoma, but not in squamous cell carcinoma (P<0.01). These results suggest that p53 and NF-kappaB cooperate in upregulating Cox-2 expression, promoting cell survival in inflammatory precursor lesions such as BE."

Of these, family 20 hexosaminidases include mammalian lysosomal hexosaminidases, fungal exochitinases, bacterial chitobiases, and insect chitinolytic hexosaminidases. The hexosaminidase activity of insects and insect cells is of particular interest because of the role that the enzyme may play in altering the structures of N-glycans generated by these cells. The N-glycan synthesis pathway in insects differs from that in mammals in that insects and insect cells produce appreciable amounts of paucimannosidic glycans (reviewed in Ref. 5Tomiya N. Narang S.

Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The former is known to be an exochitinase. However, because these studies used synthetic substrates and not N-glycan substrates in the enzyme assay, it is not known whether or not previously purified or cloned insect hexosaminidases can hydrolyze the terminal GlcNAc residue linked to the N-glycan core. In addition to the above-mentioned studies, a microsomal membrane-associated hexosaminidase activity in lepidopteran insect cells that can catalyze such a reaction has been reported (24Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glossl J. Marz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and the importance of a cellular hexosaminidase activity in N-glycan processing in insect cells was supported by the finding of an inverse relationship between the level of cellular hexosaminidase activity and the level of GlcNAc-containing N-glycans in glycoproteins expressed in S. frugiperda Sf9 cells and Estigmene acrea cells (25Wagner R. Geyer H. Geyer R. Klenk H.-D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the purification of a hexosaminidase from the culture broth of S. frugiperda Sf9 cells (Sfhex). This enzyme is a homodimer of 110 kDa with maximum activity at pH 5.5 and was found to preferentially remove terminal GlcNAc residues from the Manα(1Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar,3Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar) branch of the N-glycan core. The N-terminal sequence of the purified enzyme was subsequently used to isolate two corresponding cDNA clones from S. frugiperda mRNA. When introduced into insect cells, the Sfhex cDNA resulted in enhanced hexosaminidase activity in the medium. On the basis of our characterization of Sfhex, we believe that this hexosaminidase from lepidopteran insect cells is capable of removing the terminal GlcNAc residue linked to the N-glycan core and therefore of generating paucimannosidic N-glycans. The identification of this type of hexosaminidase not only contributes to a better understanding of N-glycan processing in insect cells, but will be important in engineering insect cells capable of generating complex N-glycans that can be used for baculovirus expression of heterologous mammalian proteins (26Luckow V.A.

All PA-derivatized oligosaccharides were successively purified using normal-phase (Amide-80) and reversed-phase (Shim-pack CLC-ODS) HPLC columns before use.TABLE 1Structures of oligosaccharides Open table in a new tab Enzyme Assay—When 4-methylumbelliferyl glycosides were used as substrates, the substrates (10 nmol) were incubated in a 96-well plate with an appropriately diluted enzyme in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 200 μl of 0.4 m glycine/NaOH buffer (pH 10.5), and released 4-methylum-belliferone was measured by fluorescence (excitation = 355 nm and emission = 460 nm) using a VICTOR Model 1420 multilabel counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD) in a fluorometric mode. When p-nitrophenyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside (pNP-GlcNAc) was used as the substrate, the substrate was incubated in a 96-well plate with an appropriately diluted enzyme in 100 μl of 30 mm sodium citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated as describe above, and released p-nitrophenol was measured at 415 nm using a Benchmark microplate reader (Bio-Rad). When PA-derivatized oligosaccharides were used as substrates, the reaction mixture contained substrates (500 pmol in 5 μl), an appropriately diluted enzyme solution (10 μl), and 0.1 m sodium citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.5; 10 μl). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for predetermined periods of time. The reaction was terminated by heating the sample for 5 min in boiling water and centrifuged to obtain a clear supernatant. Substrates and products were analyzed using a normal-phase HPLC column (Amide-80). Enzyme activity was determined by the decrease of a substrate or the production of a product upon reaction. When GnGn-PA was used to determine the branch specificity of hexosaminidase, the enzyme reaction mixture was first subjected to normal-phase HPLC to separate the substrate, mono-N-acetylglucosaminylated M3-PA products, and the M3-PA product. A fraction containing mono-N-acetylglucosaminylated M3-PA products was isolated and then subjected to reversed-phase HPLC to separate MGn-PA and GnM-PA. When human asialoor aglactotransferrin was used as the substrate, the protein (24 μg) was incubated with an appropriately diluted enzyme solution (1 μl) in 20 mm sodium citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) at 37 °C for 5.5 h. After the reaction, 6-O-methylgalactose was added to the sample as an internal standard, and the sample was heated for 5 min in boiling water and centrifuged to obtain a clear supernatant. Released GlcNAc was measured by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography using a CarboPac PA20 column (3 × 150 mm; Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) and 10 mm sodium hydroxide as an eluent. Sugars were detected by pulsed amperometry. One unit of hexosaminidase is defined as the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the release of 1 μmol of terminal GlcNAc residue from substrates in 1 min at 37 °C. HPLC—All HPLC separations were performed using an LC-10Ai HPLC system (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments). Substrate PA-derivatized oligosaccharides and their degradation products were routinely analyzed by normal-phase HPLC using an Amide-80 column (2 × 250 mm). A sample (4 μl) was injected onto an Amide-80 column pre-equilibrated with Solvent A (80:20 (v/v) acetonitrile and 10 mm ammonium formate (pH 7)), and PA-derivatized oligosaccharides were eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using a gradient consisting of Solvent A and Solvent B (50:50 (v/v) acetonitrile and 10 mm ammonium formate (pH 7)) by increasing the proportion of Solvent B (0% (t = 0 min), 50% (t = 20 min), and 100% (t = 70 min)). For reversed-phase HPLC, a sample (10 μl) was injected onto a Shim-pack CLC-ODS column (6 × 150 mm) pre-equilibrated with Solvent C (10 mm ammonium formate (pH 4.3) containing 0.1% 1-butanol). PA-derivatized oligosaccharides were eluted by increasing the concentration of 1-butanol from 0.1 to 0.175% over 30 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. PA-derivatized oligosaccharides were monitored by fluorescence (excitation = 300 nm and emission = 360 nm for normal-phase HPLC and excitation = 315 nm and emission = 380 nm for reversed-phase HPLC). Preparation of GlcNAc-amidine Affinity Adsorbent—GlcNAc-amidine-immobilized Toyopearl 650M was prepared as described previously (31Hiratake J. Sakata K. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 363: 421-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 32Inoue K. Hiratake J. Mizutani M. Takada M. Yamamoto M. Sakata K. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 1477-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. TSK-GEL Toyopearl Carboxyl-650M (wet volume of 50 ml) modified with maleimido groups via a spacer (4,7,10-trioxatridecane-1,13-diamine) was treated with 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosylamine (5.5 g, 25 mmol) and 2-iminothiolane HCl (3.4 g, 25 mmol) in dry pyridine (100 ml) (33Kato M. Uno T. Hiratake J. Sakata K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2005; 13: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mixture was shaken at room temperature for 24 h and filtered. The resin was washed with ethanol and water successively and suspended in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) until used. Cell Culture—Serum-free adapted Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were routinely grown in serum-free Sf-900 II SFM medium in shaker flasks at 140 rpm and 27 °C. The cells were passaged every 4 days at a seeding density of 0.8 × 106 cells/ml. Cell Extract and Supernatant Preparation—The suspension culture was typically harvested at 96 h post-seeding, and a clarified cell culture supernatant and a cell pellet were obtained by centrifugation at 350 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed by resuspending the cell pellet in chilled PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by two cycles of sonication with a Tekmar sonic disruptor for 30 s at a 50% duty cycle and a power setting of 5. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the clear extract was used for analysis. Purification of Hexosaminidase—At 96 h post-seeding, the suspension culture (1.8 liters) was centrifuged at 350 × g for 10 min, and the cell-free supernatant was collected. Purification was carried out at 4 °C. To the clarified cell culture supernatant were added sodium chloride and sodium citrate to final concentrations of 1 m and 10 mm, respectively, and the pH was adjusted to 6.0 with a dilute sodium hydroxide solution. The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 5 ml/min onto the GlcNAc-amidine affinity column (2.5 × 6 cm, 30 ml) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1 m sodium chloride. After washing the column with 3 bed volumes of the same buffer, bound protein was eluted with 10 mm sodium citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 m d-Gl-cNAc at a flow rate of 5 ml/min by pumping the elution buffer in the reverse direction, and 5-ml fractions were collected. Hexosaminidase activity in each fraction was measured with MU-GlcNAc as the substrate, and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE—The purified Sf hex protein (0.5 μg) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gel) under reducing conditions, and proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Gel Filtration Chromatography—The purified Sfhex protein (30 μg in 0.5 ml) was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (1.6 × 60 cm) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm sodium citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.15 m sodium chloride. After loading a sample, protein was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 25 ml/h, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Hexosaminidase activity in each fraction was measured with MU-GlcNAc as the substrate as described above. The column was calibrated with bovine thyroglobulin, human IgG, bovine serum albumin, chicken ovalbumin, bovine β-lactoglobulin, bovine ribonuclease A, and uridine. Deglycosylation—N-Glycans attached to Sfhex was released by digesting the purified Sfhex protein with peptide N-glycosidase F. The reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing of N-terminal Amino Acids—N-terminal sequence analysis of the protein sample was carried out by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Procise Model 494A protein sequencer. Isolation of a cDNA Clone Encoding Sfhex and DNA Sequencing—Aligning the amino acid sequences of hexosaminidases from human, mouse, D. melanogaster, B. mori, M. sexta, and T. ni showed a highly conserved internal peptide (H(L/M)GG-DEV, amino acids (aa) 318-324 of the human hexosaminidase α-chain) that forms part of the catalytic domain. This segment is common to all of these hexosaminidases and many other hexosaminidases in the GH20 family. Degenerate primers derived from both the N-terminal (LSIVNPGPQYPPTKGSIWPRP) and internal sequences were used for reverse transcription-PCR of Sf9 RNA to amplify a cDNA corresponding to a portion of the Sfhex gene. We reasoned that, although the downstream primer is common to all known hexosaminidase proteins, the upstream primer is specific for the Sfhex gene, and therefore, only the cDNA corresponding to the Sfhex gene would be amplified. The forward primer SF1′ (5′-CACTAAGCTTAAYCCNGGNCCNCARTAYCC) contained a HindIII site (shown in italics) and sequence corresponding to aa 23-29 (Supplemental Fig. S3). The reverse primer SF5′ (5-AGTGAAGCTTACYTCRTCNCCNCCNADRTG) contained a HindIII site (shown in italics) and sequence corresponding to aa 333-339. Total RNA prepared by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) from Sf9 cells treated with amplification-grade DNase I (Invitrogen) was used as the template. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the 3′-SMART RACE kit (Clontech) to perform first-strand cDNA synthesis with 0.6 μg of template RNA. Subsequently, 2.5 μl (of the 110-μl reverse transcription reaction) was introduced into a 100-μl PCR at the following cycle settings: 94 °C for 5 min; 40 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; 72 °C for 10 min; and hold at 4 °C. PCR reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems, and PCR was performed using AmpliTaq Gold in 3.5 mm MgCl2 with an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler. The 948-bp product was subcloned into pUC18 and sequenced on both strands using BigDye terminators (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by the Nucleic Acid/Protein Core Research Facility of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The DNA sequence of the partial cDNA fragment matched the seven N-terminal amino acids used for designing the upstream degenerate primer, as well as the next 10 amino acids of the determined N-terminal sequence of Sfhex, confirming that the desired cDNA had been isolated. The full-length cDNA for the Sfhex gene was obtained by performing both 5′- and 3′-RACE using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification and BD Advantage 2 PCR kits (Clontech). For 3′-RACE, first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed as described above, and 2.5 μl (of 110 μl) was introduced into a 50-μl PCR using the gene-specific upstream primer SF6 (5′-GCTCCTGGGGCGTTGCGTATCCAA, aa 280-288) and the universal primer UPM as the downstream primer at the following cycle settings: 94 °C for 5"
https://openalex.org/W1996655643,"We have identified a new mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene fusion partner in a patient with treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presenting a t(2;11)(q37;q23) as the only cytogenetic abnormality. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated a rearrangement of the MLL gene and molecular genetic analyses identified a septin family gene, SEPT2, located on chromosome 2q37, as the fusion partner of MLL. RNA and DNA analyses showed the existence of an in-frame fusion of MLL exon 7 with SEPT2 exon 3, with the genomic breakpoints located in intron 7 and 2 of MLL and SEPT2, respectively. Search for DNA sequence motifs revealed the existence of two sequences with 94.4% homology with the topoisomerase II consensus cleavage site in MLL intron 7 and SEPT2 intron 2. SEPT2 is the fifth septin family gene fused with MLL, making this gene family the most frequently involved in MLL-related AML (about 10% of all known fusion partners). The protein encoded by SEPT2 is highly homologous to septins 1, 4 and 5 and is involved in the coordination of several key steps of mitosis. Further studies are warranted to understand why the septin protein family is particularly involved in the pathogenesis of MLL-associated leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2124762109,"Thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) has been reported to dominate the defense against H2O2, other hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrite at the expense of thioredoxin (Trx) B and C in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt). By homology, the enzyme has been classified as an atypical 2-C-peroxiredoxin (Prx), with Cys60 as the “peroxidatic” cysteine (CP) forming a complex catalytic center with Cys93 as the “resolving” cysteine (CR). Site-directed mutagenesis confirms Cys60 to be CP and Cys80 to be catalytically irrelevant. Replacing Cys93 with serine leads to fast inactivation as seen by conventional activity determination, which is associated with oxidation of Cys60 to a sulfinic acid derivative. However, in comparative stopped-flow analysis, WT-MtTPx and MtTPx C93S reduce peroxynitrite and react with TrxB and -C similarly fast. Reduction of pre-oxidized WT-MtTPx and MtTPx C93S by MtTrxB is demonstrated by monitoring the redox-dependent tryptophan fluorescence of MtTrxB. Furthermore, MtTPx C93S remains stable for 10 min at a morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride-generated low flux of peroxynitrite and excess MtTrxB in a dihydrorhodamine oxidation model. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed disulfide bridges between Cys60 and Cys93 and between Cys60 and Cys80 in oxidized WT-MtTPx. Reaction of pre-oxidized WT-MtTPx and MtTPx C93S with MtTrxB C34S or MtTrxC C40S yielded dead-end intermediates in which the Trx mutants are preferentially linked via disulfide bonds to Cys60 and never to Cys93 of the TPx. It is concluded that neither Cys80 nor Cys93 is required for the catalytic cycle of the peroxidase. Instead, MtTPx can react as a 1-C-Prx with Cys60 being the site of attack for both the oxidizing and the reducing substrate. The role of Cys93 is likely to conserve the oxidation equivalents of the sulfenic acid state of CP as a disulfide bond to prevent overoxidation of Cys60 under a restricted supply of reducing substrate.

The peroxide metabolism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is intriguing in several respects. (i) Like other actinomycetes M. tuberculosis lacks glutathione and, consequently, the glutathione peroxidases that dominate the antioxidant defense of its mammalian hosts (1.Flohé L. Brigelius-Flohé R. Hatfield D.L. Selenium. Its Molecular Biology and Role in Human Health. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands2001: 157-178Crossref Google Scholar). (ii) The H2O2 metabolism of the pathogen has long been recognized to depend on a heme-containing catalase/peroxidase, because experimental KatG−1 strains devoid of this heme protein were found to be avirulent (2.Sherman D.R. Mdluli K. Hickey M.J. Arain T.M. Morris S.L. Barry III, C.E. Stover C.K. Science. 1996; 272: 1641-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). (iii) Clinical isolates lacking the catalase were virulent, however, and proved to be resistant against the first line tuberculostatic isoniazid, because the enzyme is evidently required to activate this drug (3.Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). (iv) The survival and virulence of such strains are attributed to a 2-C peroxiredoxin-type peroxidase, AhpC, because it was often found elevated in catalase-deficient clinical isolates (2.Sherman D.R. Mdluli K. Hickey M.J. Arain T.M. Morris S.L. Barry III, C.E. Stover C.K. Science. 1996; 272: 1641-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). (v) The most common AhpC reductant of bacteria, the disulfide reductase AhpF, is deleted in M. tuberculosis, and the rudimentary alkyl hydroperoxide reductase system appears not to respond to oxidative stress like in enterobacteria (4.Storz G. Christman M.F. Sies H. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8917-8921Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), because a functional oxyR is equally missing (5.Sherman D.R. Sabo P.J. Hickey M.J. Arain T.M. Mahairas G.G. Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Stover C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6625-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).

Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) or by one of the mycobacterial thioredoxins, MtTrxC (7.Jaeger T. Budde H. Flohé L. Menge U. Singh M. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). (vii) Mycobacteria contain two more peroxiredoxins, the 1-C-Prx AhpE, whose function still remains elusive (8.Li S. Peterson N.A. Kim M.Y. Kim C.Y. Hung L.W. Yu M. Lekin T. Segelke B.W. Lott J.S. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the “thiol peroxidase” MtTPx, which proved to be a thioredoxin peroxidase (7.Jaeger T. Budde H. Flohé L. Menge U. Singh M. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). MtTPx, which is addressed here, has been characterized recently as the most effective peroxidase of M. tuberculosis in terms of rate constants for the reaction with hydroperoxides and peroxynitrite. It reduces a broad spectrum of hydroperoxides, including H2O2, and its reduced state is specifically regenerated by two of the mycobacterial thioredoxins, MtTrxB and MtTrxC. According to available proteomes of M. tuberculosis, MtTPx is regularly more abundant than the better known antioxidant enzymes catalase/peroxidase and AhpC and may therefore be considered to be the dominant antioxidant device that guarantees the survival of the pathogen in the oxidant environment of the phagocytes of the host. The enzyme has a limited similarity with human Prxs, the most similar one being PrxII with only 21% identities. This dissimilarity to mammalian sequences as well as the putative functional importance underscores the potential use of MtTPx as a drug target. By sequence, MtTPx is classified as an atypical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (2-C-Prx). It is closely related to a variety of thiol peroxidases, of which the thioredoxin peroxidase of Escherichia coli has been most extensively investigated in terms of structure (9.Choi J. Choi S. Choi J. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Shin W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49478-49486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and functional aspects (10.Baker L.M. Poole L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9203-9211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism common to all peroxiredoxins consists of the oxidation of a highly reactive “peroxidatic” cysteine (CP) to a sulfenic acid derivative, which is followed by a direct or indirect reduction by a thiol substrate (11.Poole L.B. Ellis H.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12.Poole L.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 240-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As was first shown for the tryparedoxin peroxidase of Leishmania donovani (13.Flohé L. Budde H. Bruns K. Castro H. Clos J. Hofmann B. Kansal-Kalavar S. Krumme D. Menge U. Plank-Schumacher K. Sztajer H. Wissing J. Wylegalla C. Hecht H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 324-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the activation of CP is achieved by the positive charge of a neighboring arginine residue and hydrogen bonding with a threonine or, less commonly, a serine residue, which forces the active site cysteine into the thiolate form that readily reacts with any kind of ROOH (14.Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The reduction of the resulting sulfenic acid differs between different types of Prxs. In the case of the typical 2-C-Prxs, the primary reductant is a cysteine conserved near the C terminus (“CR” for resolving cysteine) that forms a disulfide bridge with CP, which then reacts with the reducing substrate, typically a protein containing a CXXC motif such as thioredoxin, tryparedoxin, or AhpF (14.Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 15.Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). However, because CR is sterically out of reach for CP within the same protein subunit, the disulfide is formed between two inversely oriented subunits. During this process CP is delocalized in a way that it is no longer accessible to the reducing substrate. The catalysis would therefore be arrested in the oxidized form, if the reducing substrate could not “resolve” this block by attacking the sulfur of the distally conserved cysteine, which thus becomes the CR. In 1-C-Prxs the C-terminal cysteine is not conserved, and the reducing thiol substrate has to react directly with the oxidized CP. In the atypical 2-C-Prxs the CR typical of the 2-C-Prxs is also missing, but another cysteine is presumed to substitute for CR in a way that it forms an intra-subunit disulfide bridge that is the prerequisite to terminate the catalytic cycle (9.Choi J. Choi S. Choi J. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Shin W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49478-49486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The recently resolved x-ray structures of MtTPx (PDB 1XVQ), of the molecular mutant MtTPx C60S (PDB 1Y25 (16.Stehr M. Hecht H.J. Jaeger T. Flohé L. Singh M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)), and of the related peroxiredoxins of Haemophilus influenzae (PDB 1Q98), E. coli (PDB 1QXH (9.Choi J. Choi S. Choi J. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Shin W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49478-49486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)), and Salmonella pneumoniae (PDB 1PSQ) reveal that Cys60 in MtTPx builds the center of the catalytic triad typical of Prxs, which here is composed of Cys60, Thr57, and Arg130. Cys60 thus should be the peroxidatic cysteine, whereas Cys93 is homologous to the presumed CR of related atypical 2-C-Prxs, and the third cysteine in MtTPx, Cys80, remains of questionable functional relevance. The x-ray structures, however, did not provide unambiguous evidence for any obligatory involvement of Cys93 in the catalysis. In fact, the C-α distance between Ser60 (corresponding to Cys60) and Cys93 in MtTPx C60S appeared too large to allow a disulfide formation without major rearrangements (Fig. 1). The expected Cys60-Cys93 disulfide bond is not clearly visible in the structure of oxidized MtTPx (PDB 1XVQ) either, and the substantial residual activity of EcTPx C95S that has been reported recently by Baker and Poole (10.Baker L.M. Poole L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9203-9211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) sheds further doubt on the hypothesis that the distal conserved cysteine of the atypical 2-C-Prxs is always functionally equivalent to the resolving cysteine of typical 2-C-Prxs. Here we present compelling evidence for a novel variation of Prx catalysis. The catalytic mechanism of MtTPx does not necessarily involve the presumed CR but rather corresponds to that of a 1-C-Prx. The cysteine homologous to CR, however, prevents inactivation of the enzyme by hydroperoxides under limited supply of reductants by saving the oxidation equivalents in a readily reversible oxidation state. MtTPx, MtTrxB, and MtTrxC were heterologously expressed as His-tagged proteins in E. coli as described by Jaeger et al. (7.Jaeger T. Budde H. Flohé L. Menge U. Singh M. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mutations C60S, C80S, and C93S were introduced into MtTPx by site-directed mutagenesis PCR (17.Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar) using the TPx gene cloned into pET22b(+) as template (7.Jaeger T. Budde H. Flohé L. Menge U. Singh M. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For the C60S mutation, the following mismatched primers were used: 5′-caccggtgtccgcgacgagtg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cactcgtcgcggacaccggtg-3′ (backward). The C80S mutation was introduced with the mismatched primers 5′-ccgtgctgtccgtctcgaagg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ccttcgagacggacagcacgg-3′ (backward), and that of C93S mutation with the mismatched primers 5′-gaagcgcttctccggcgccgag-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctcggcgccggagaagcgcttc-3′ (backward). The triplets coding for the mutations are underlined. Each mutation was introduced with the forward mismatched primer in combination with the pET22b(+) T7 terminator primer (5′-gctagttattgctcagcgg-3′) and the backward mismatched primer in combination with the pET22b(+) T7 promoter primer (5′-taatacgactcactataggg-3′). Reaction mixtures contained 10-40 ng of template DNA, 125 ng of each primer, 20 μm dNTPs, and 1 μl of Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 1 min were carried out in a Tpersonal Cycler (Biometra, Goettingen, Germany) followed by 72 °C for 10 min. Both resulting PCR products that carried the mutation were cut from a 1% agarose gel and purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Similarly, the mutants of MtTrxB and -C were obtained by mutating the distal cysteine, 34 4The introduced starting methionine was counted as 1, which is necessary for protein expression in E. coli. Accordingly, Cys34 is equivalent to Cys33 in natural MtTrxB. or 40, respectively, of the CXXC motif to serine. Briefly, a first round of PCR (30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) using Proof Start DNA polymerase (Qiagen) was performed with the following primer pairs: forward T7 promoter (5′-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3′)/reverse MtT-rxB C34S (5′-GCGAACGCGCGGCTCGGGCCGCA-3′) or reverse T7 terminator (5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGT-3′)/forward MtTrxB C34S (5′-TGCGGCCCGAGCCGCGCGTTCGC-3′) for MtTrxB, and forward T7 promoter/reverse MtTrxC C40S (5′-CTACCATCTTGCTAGGTCCACAC-3′) or reverse T7-terminator/forward MtTrxC C40S (5′-GTGTGGACCTAGCAAGATGGTAG-3′) for MtTrxC. Plasmids harboring wild-type genes of MtTrxB or MtTrxC, and engineered to contain a C- or N-terminal His tag, were used as DNA templates (7.Jaeger T. Budde H. Flohé L. Menge U. Singh M. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The relocation of mutated genes was carried out in a PCR that included both purified overlapping PCR products in combination with the T7 promoter and terminator primer. The purified PCR product was digested with NdeI and HindIII, ligated into the pET22b(+) vector (Merck), and subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (TPx mutants) or E. coli Tuner (DE3) (Trx mutants), respectively. The DNA sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant proteins were expressed, purified as described (7.Jaeger T. Budde H. Flohé L. Menge U. Singh M. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and checked for identity by MS/MS analysis. Conventional activity determinations of MtTPx and derived mutants were performed by means of a coupled test that measures thioredoxin-mediated NADPH consumption by thioredoxin reductase as described by Jaeger et al. (7.Jaeger T. Budde H. Flohé L. Menge U. Singh M. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Preincubation conditions were 10 μm thioredoxin reductase, 10 μm thioredoxin B or C, 5 μm MtTPx, 450 μm NADPH, 1 mm EDTA in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. The reaction was started with 73 μm tert-butyl hydroperoxide (final concentration) and monitored continuously. Direct stopped-flow measurement of peroxynitrite reduction by MtTPx was performed as follows. Peroxynitrite was freshly synthesized in a quenched-flow reactor from sodium nitrite and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under acidic conditions and quantified as described previously (18.Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stock solutions of peroxynitrite were treated with granular manganese dioxide to eliminate H2O2 remaining from the synthesis. Nitrite content in samples of peroxynitrite was typically <30% of the peroxynitrite concentration. MtTPx (either wild-type or mutants) and MtTrxC or -B were reduced overnight by the addition of a >10-fold excess dithiothreitol (DTT). Excess reductant was removed immediately before use by passing the proteins through a high pressure liquid chromatography-connected Hitrap column (Amersham Biosciences) with UV-visible detection at 280 nm and collected manually in rubber-capped tubes, which were subsequently bubbled with argon at 4 °C. Total thiol content was determined by Ellman's reagent to exclude the presence of any relevant residual DTT. The extensively degassed elution buffer was 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, plus 0.1 mm DTPA. The reduction of peroxynitrite by reduced MtTPx (either wild-type or the mutants C60S, C80S, or C93S, respectively) was then studied at pH 7.4 and 25 °C in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SX-17MV; Applied Photophysics) with a mixing time of less than 2 ms, monitoring peroxynitrite decomposition at 310 nm with or without pre-reduced enzyme at the concentrations indicated (19.Trujillo M. Budde H. Pineyro M.D. Stehr M. Robello C. Flohé L. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34175-34182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For the determinations of initial rates of peroxynitrite decomposition, 200 absorbance points were acquired during the first 20 ms of the reaction, and 200 further points were acquired until more than 90% peroxynitrite had decomposed (0.02-20 s). Computer-assisted simulations were performed using Gepasi software (20.Mendes P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The reduction of peroxynitrite-oxidized MtTPx or its mutants by its natural reductants, i.e. MtTrxB or MtTrxC, was evaluated by monitoring the peroxynitrite decomposition rate at a low MtTPx concentration and its acceleration by MtTrxC or MtTrxB. Precisely, 1.1 μm pre-reduced MtTPx was reacted with 5 μm peroxynitrite to yield a fast initial peroxynitrite reduction followed by the slope typical of spontaneous peroxynitrite decomposition. The slope thus obtained provides the base line to be compared with that observed upon addition of pre-reduced MtTrxB or MtTrxC (33 μm), which by themselves only marginally affect the peroxynitrite decay. The experimnetal results were then compared with curves calculated by means of known (7.Jaeger T. Budde H. Flohé L. Menge U. Singh M. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or estimated rate constants. Alternatively, rates of reduction of MtTPx (or mutants) by TrxB were measured directly by taking advantage of redox-dependent fluorescence changes of MtTrxB. The reaction of 2.25 μm MtTrxB, pre-reduced by DTT, with excess MtTPx (or mutants; 15-40 μm) was analyzed by the stopped-flow technique monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence of MtTrxB at λ >335 nm and an excitation wavelength of λ = 280 nm. Qualitatively, the reaction of MtTrxB with MtTPx (and molecular mutants) was investigated by monitoring the oxidation of dihydrorhodamine (DHR) by a low flux of peroxynitrite (∼0.7 μm/min) generated by 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1) as follows. 120 μm DHR was exposed to 50 μm SIN-1 yielding a constant oxidation rate of 0.28 μm/min, as monitored at 500 nm (ϵ = 78,800). The influence of MtTrxB, mutants MtTPx, and combinations thereof on slope and/or lag phase is then taken as a semi-quantitative measure of interference with the oxidation process (19.Trujillo M. Budde H. Pineyro M.D. Stehr M. Robello C. Flohé L. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34175-34182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Protein Reduction and Oxidation—If not stated differently, each protein was reduced for 80 min at 37 °C with 50 mm DTT in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Following removal of the reductant by buffer exchange (gel filtration on a Bio-Spin 6 column, twice), TPx 25 μm was mixed in different experiments with 100 μm hydrogen peroxide or 150 μm TrxB. The sequence of additions and the incubation times are reported for specific experiments under “Results.” The reaction was stopped by adjusting the sample to pH 2 by HCl. Enzymatic Digestions—Pepsin was added at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) in 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 2.5. After 3 h of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by cooling on ice. Trypsin was added at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w) in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the pH was adjusted to 2 with trifluoroacetic acid to stop the reaction. Ten μl of the peptide mixtures were applied to LC-ESI-MS/MS. LC-ESI-MS/MS Analysis of Peptides—For liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, a Surveyor MS high pressure liquid chromatography pump equipped with a MicroAS autosampler (loop 20 μl) was coupled to an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer by an electrospray interface (ThermoElectron, Milan, Italy). An ACE C18 column (1 × 150 mm, 5 μm; ACT, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK) with an acetonitrile gradient was used (eluent A, 0.1% formic acid in water; eluent B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The gradient profile was 5% eluent B for 4 min followed by 5-50% eluent B within 40 min. For mass spectrometry, the heated capillary was held at 180 °C and voltage at 38 V. Spray voltage was 5.2 kV. Spectra were acquired in positive mode (in the range 400-2000 m/z) using dynamic exclusion for MS/MS analysis (relative collision energy of 35%, repeat count 3). Data Handling of Mass Spectra—Computer analysis of peptide MS/MS spectra was performed using Bioworks 3.1, based on SEQUEST algorithm (University of Washington and licensed to ThermoFinnigan Corp.). For the peptic peptide mixture, the “no enzyme” option was used because of the limited specificity of pepsin cleavage. As confidence of peptide identification, the minimum values of Xcorr were greater than 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 for single, double, and triple charge ions, respectively. Identification of disulfides was carried out as follows. First, the most frequent cysteine-containing peptides obtained by pepsin digestion were identified in both TPx and Trx. Then these peptides were used for manual calculation of possible peptides linked by disulfide bridges. The minimum consecutive multicharge ions of a possible “hybrid peptide” were 3. When possible, manual evaluation of related MS/MS spectra was performed to obtain partial amino acid sequences of one or both peptides. Apparent Activity of Molecular Mutants in Conventional Test—To define the catalytic role of each of the three cysteines in MtTPx, the molecular mutants C60S, C80S, and C93S were first investigated for catalytic efficiency by means of the conventional coupled test system that mimics the physiological context of the enzyme as follows: NADPH consumption for hydroperoxide reduction via thioredoxin reductase, MtTrxC, and MtTPx. As is evident from Fig. 2 MtTPx C60S is absolutely inactive, whereas MtTPx C80S is indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme. The first finding complies with the expectation that Cys60 is the CP, and the second observation rules out any substantial role of Cys80 in the catalysis. At first glance the relevance of Cys93 to catalysis is corroborated by a marginal residual activity of MtTPx C93S. A closer inspection of the trace, however, discloses that for a few seconds a discrete residual activity is retained in MtTPx C93S, although thereafter NADPH consumption approaches that of the negative control. This finding points rather to a fast inactivation than to an abrogation of catalytic efficacy itself. Stopped-flow Analysis of MtTPx Oxidation by Peroxynitrite—In a first set of experiments, the oxidation of WT-MtTPx and MtTPx mutants by peroxynitrite was measured directly in the millisecond range by monitoring the absorption at λ = 310, which is characteristic of peroxynitrite. For this purpose the enzyme samples were reduced by DTT and freed of reductant by gel filtration. Their total thiol content was determined to range between 2.6 and 3.4 thiol groups per subunit of protein, which is consistent with the absence of relevant amounts of low molecular thiols. Any traces of undetected residual DTT in this range of concentrations would not have affected the measurements, because its second-order rate constant with peroxynitrite is only 1100 m−1 s−1 (data not shown). In the presence of 40 μm wild-type enzyme, peroxynitrite (18 μm) decays very rapidly, in agreement with the fast second-order rate constant (k1′= 1.5 × 107 m−1 s−1, pH 7.4, 25 °C) that was reported previously for peroxynitrite-dependent MtTPx oxidation (7.Jaeger T. Budde H. Flohé L. Menge U. Singh M. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The reaction is so fast that an important fraction of peroxynitrite (∼50%) already decayed during the first 2 ms, i.e. the mixing time of the apparatus (Fig. 3). With MtTPx C60S (46 μm) the rate of peroxynitrite decay is practically the same as in the absence of enzyme, confirming that Cys60 is responsible for the fast peroxynitrite reduction, i.e. Cys60 is CP. MtTPx C80S and MtTPx C93S also react very fast with peroxynitrite. The rate constant for MtTPx C93S (2 × 106 m−1 s−1) is, in fact, close to that established previously for the wild-type enzyme (1.5 × 107m−1 s−1). In view of the pronounced instability of MtTPx C93S under oxidizing conditions, the difference is likely explained by an overestimation of the native enzyme. In essence, the results are hardly compatible with an essential involvement of Cys93 (or Cys80) in the oxidative part of the catalytic process. Reduction of Oxidized MtTPx by Its Natural Substrates—As Cys93 is, by analogy, suspected to be the resolving cysteine, its replacement by serine might selectively affect the interaction with the reducing substrate. The limiting apparent rate constant k2′ for the reduction of oxidized MtTPx by MtTrxB or -C had to be analyzed to demonstrate if MtTPx C93S can also act as a peroxynitrite reductase when using its natural reductants. This task, however, afforded a control model for which the relevant rate constants had been established previously or were accessible. Therefore, peroxynitrite decomposition in the p"

We here searched for kinases with a core catalytic structure similar to CaMKI and CaMKIV. We isolated full-length cDNAs encoding three mouse CaMKI/CaMKIV-related kinases, CLICK-I (CL1)/doublecortin and CaM kinase-Like (DCAMKL)1, CLICK-II (CL2)/DCAMKL2, and CLICK-I,II-related (CLr)/DCAMKL3, the kinase domains of which had an intermediate homology not only to CaMKI/CaMKIV but also to CaMKII.

CL1α and CL1β were shorter isoforms of DCAMKL1, which lacked the doublecortin-like domain (Dx). In contrast, CL2α and CL2β contained a full N-terminal Dx, whereas CLr only possessed a partial and dysfunctional Dx. Interestingly, despite a large similarity in the kinase domain, CL1/CL2/CLr had an impact on CRE-dependent gene expression distinct from that of the related CaMKI/CaMKIV and CaMKII. Although these were previously shown to activate Ca2+/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent transcription, we here show that CL1 and CL2 were unable to significantly phosphorylate CREB Ser-133 and rather inhibited CRE-dependent gene expression by a dominant mechanism that bypassed CREB and was mediated by phosphorylated TORC2.

The availability of the human and other mammalian genome sequences provides a powerful means to dissect en masse the function of a particular class of proteins whose primary function can be deduced based on their primary sequences. The entire catalog of putative mammalian protein kinases, or kinome, has recently been established and curated (1.Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S.

This achievement per se is significant and now affords a better understanding of the biological role of kinases as regulatable switches under many physiologically and pathophysiologically critical circumstances. However, precise knowledge about the molecular characteristics of individual kinase molecules is still lacking (3.Cohen P. Nat. Rev.

Despite its nomenclature, however, only the classic CaMK subgroups such as CaMKII family, or the CaMKI/CaMKIV family, are genuinely catalytically Ca2+/CaM-dependent. Most of the kinases of the CaMK group actually lack the characteristic Ca2+/CaM-sensitive regulatory domain. They nonetheless belong to the CaMK group, because they share in common a significant homology in the primary structure of their kinase domains. Several classic CaMKs such as CaMKII and CaMKIV are highly expressed in the central nervous system and have been convincingly shown to play a critical role in long term synaptic plasticity and in several forms of long term memory (4.Silva A.J.

Thus, elucidation of the biological function of classic CaMKs is one of the key issues in neuroscience. Despite these insights, not many investigations have specifically addressed how many CaMKs or related kinases are expressed in the central nervous system, and how many of them actually might play a role in regulation of brain circuitry formation, maturation, or plasticity. For example, it is only recently that the diversity of the CaMKI subfamily consisting of four separate genes has been appreciated (1.Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S.

Consistent with our goal, we identified three mouse CaMKI/CaMKIV-related kinases, CLICK-I (CL1)/DCAMKL1, CLICK-II (CL2)/DCAMKL2, and CLICK-I,II-related (CLr)/DCAMKL3, the kinase domains of which were structurally related not only to CaMKIV and CaMKI but that also had comparable homology to CaMKII. Furthermore, CL1, CL2, and CLr were highly expressed throughout the central nervous system, in a neuron-specific fashion, from embryonic stages until adulthood. We identified several distinct open reading frames for CL1, CL2, and CLr. Whereas CL1α and CL1β are shorter isoforms of DCAMKL1 that lack the doublecortin-like domain (23.Nagase T. Ishikawa K.

In contrast, CLr only contained an incomplete Dx-like homology and was unable to localize with microtubules. Interestingly, despite a large structural similarity in the kinase domain, the functional impact of kinase activity of CL1/CL2/CLr kinases appeared distinct from the related CaMKI/CaMKIV and CaMKII. Indeed, although both CaMKI/CaMKIV and CaMKII branches of the CaMK family are established Ca2+/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylating kinases (11.Bito H. Deisseroth K.

All reagents were of analytical grade, and all experiments involving radioisotopes, animals, or recombinant DNAs were approved by recombinant DNA and Animal Research Committees and carried out following guidelines established at the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University, in accordance with regulations and laws set by the Japanese government. Molecular Cloning of Full-length CLICK-I, CLICK-II, and CLICK-I,II-related cDNAs—To screen for the presence of yet uncharacterized CaMK-like kinases, degenerate oligonucleotide primers were constructed as follows: CaMK5′-1, 5′-GTICAYMGIGAYMTCAARCC-3′ (Y = T/C, M = A/C, R = A/G); CaMK5′-2, 5′-GTICAYMGIGAYMTGAARCC-3′ (Y = T/C, M = A/C, R = A/G); CaMK5′-3, 5′-GTICAYMGIGAYMTAAARCC-3′ (Y = T/C, M = A/C, R = A/G); and CaMK3′, 5′-CCYGGRGTYCCACAIRCYGT-3′ (Y = T/C, R = A/G). 100 pmol of a 1:1:1 mixture of CaMK5′-1/CaMK5′-2/CaMK5′-3 and 100 pmol of CaMK3′ were included with ∼100 ng of Sprague-Dawley rat adult hippocampal cDNA in a standard 50-μl PCR carried out for 35 cycles at 30-s denaturation at 94 °C, 1-min annealing at 48 °C, 1-min extension at 72 °C, using native Taq polymerase (GeneTaq, Nippon Gene). After confirming the presence of an expected ∼140-bp band, this PCR fragment was co-digested with BspHI, BstXI, BclI in NEB buffer 2 (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, New England Biolabs), because these three enzymes were expected to digest the PCR fragments amplified from known CaMKI/CaMKIV cDNAs. A portion of the ∼140-bp fragment consistently remained resistant to enzyme digestion. To identify this fragment, this resistant PCR band was gelpurified from a 3% NuSieve GTG-agarose gel, and subcloned into T7Blue-2 (Novagen) by TA cloning. Isolation of independent colonies and sequence analysis revealed the presence of two related inserts that were homologous to, but had only limited identity with, known members of the CaMKI/CaMKIV family. These fragments were tentatively considered as CaMK-like CREB regulatory kinase candidates (CLICKs), and named CLICK-I (CL1) and CLICK-II (CL2), respectively. EST search revealed the presence of mouse orthologs for both CL1 and CL2, but none represented fulllength cDNAs. Full-length 5′-ends and 3′-ends for mouse CL1 and CL2 were identified by rapid amplification of 5′- and 3′-cDNA end (5′- and 3′-RACE) procedures using a Smart RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). We obtained multiple 3′-RACE fragments of different sizes for both CL1 and CL2, and sequencing confirmed the presence of at least two C-terminal splice variants in each case. As for the 5′-end, the most remote ATG codon that was found in-frame was considered as the putative initiation site of the open reading frame. Finally, to isolate genuine full-length open reading frames (ORFs), PCR was carried out between the putative initiation ATG and the two alternate stop codons using Advantage High Fidelity Polymerase (Clontech) and ICR mouse adult hippocampal cDNA as a template. A CL1- and CL2-related mouse FANTOM clone C730036H08 was obtained from Dnaform (Tokyo, Japan). Although this clone was deposited as a partial cDNA, full sequencing of its 5′-end revealed a C insertion at position 566 of the originally deposited sequence. Correction of this frameshift unmasked a previously unrecognized cryptic N terminus with a functional ATG initiation codon starting from position 154. In total, six distinct full-length cDNAs were obtained in this study and designated as CLICK-Iα (GenBank™ accession number AY968047), CLICK-Iβ (AY968048), CLICK-IIα (AY968049), CLICK-IIβ1 (AY968050), CLICK-IIβ2 (AY968051), and CLICK-I,II-related (DQ286388). Genomic Mapping—Kinase domain sequences of CLICK-I (CL1), CLICK-II (CL2), and CLICK-I,II-related (CLr) were mapped on the Human and Mouse Genome Database, as made available by NCBI and Celera. BAC clones mapped to 3D and 3F1 were obtained from the BACPAC Resource Center (Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA) to ascertain that both CL1/Dcamkl1 and CL2/Dcamkl2 loci were located indeed in relative vicinity on the mouse chromosomes 3D and 3F1, respectively. Kinase Characterization—All expression vectors for wildtype and mutant CL1, CL2, and CLr were constructed in either pDEST26 or pEGFP-C1 vector backbones using PCR, TOPO cloning or GATEWAY technology (Invitrogen), with addition of either N-terminal Myc tag, HA tag, or EGFP tag, as indicated. Domain deletion and introduction of point mutations were carried out on CL1α and CL2β2 backbones, unless stated otherwise, using PCR and by use of QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The presence of proper inserts and mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids used in this report were as follows: CL1α (amino acid (aa) position 1-421), CL1αKD (aa 1-421 with Lys at position 111 mutated to Ala), CL1ΔC (aa 1-353), CL2α (aa 1-771), CL2β (aa 1-714 of CL2β2), ΔDx-CL2β (aa 377-714 of CL2β2), ΔDx-CL2βKD (aa 377-714 with Lys at position 437 mutated to Ala), ΔDx-CL2ΔC (aa 377-679 of CL2β2), and CL2-Dx (aa 1-431 of CL2α). These constructs were transfected in COS-7 cells, and crude lysates were prepared in a Ca2+-free buffer containing (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 μm calyculin A, and 1 × EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Immunoprecipitates were obtained using an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and were subjected to kinase assays as described using 5 μg of myelin basic protein as a substrate (17.Takemoto-Kimura S. Terai H. Takamoto M. Ohmae S. Kikumura S. Segi E. Arakawa Y. Furuyashiki T. Narumiya S. Bito H. J. Biol.

Integrity of expressed proteins was verified by silver staining or by immunoblot using a mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The 32P incorporation was visualized using BioMax x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Pull-down assays using CaM beads were done as described previously (17.Takemoto-Kimura S. Terai H. Takamoto M.

Transcript Analyses—Northern blot analyses were carried out using pre-made poly(A)+ RNA blots (2 μg per lane) obtained from Clontech. Blots were hybridized using a 32P-labeled DNA probe corresponding to the nucleotide position 58-1116 of CL1α (AY968047), 3-2039 of CL2α (AY968049), and 514-2373 of CLr (DQ286388) (for position see Fig. 1A), according to Ref. 17.Takemoto-Kimura S.

In brief, anesthetized mice were perfusion-fixed with Tissue Fixative (GenoStaff, Inc.), and dissected tissues were sectioned after paraffin embedding. For generation of antisense and sense cRNA probes, 294-, 255-, and 1860-bp fragments corresponding to the nucleotide position 898-1191 of CL1α, 860-1114 of CL2α, and 514-2373 of CLr were subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ vector (Stratagene). Digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes were prepared with DIG RNA labeling Mix (Roche Applied Science). Coloring reactions were performed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, an alkaline phosphatase color substrate, and tissue sections were counterstained with Kernechtrot stain solution (Muto Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd.). After mounting, 24-bit color images were acquired by scanning the sections using an Epson GT-8400UF digital scanner at 3200-dpi resolution (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S1). DIG signals were isolated by uniformly subtracting the counterstaining color component using Photoshop version 7.0.1. (Adobe) and displayed in 8-bit grayscale without further correction (Fig. 3, B and D).FIGURE 3CL1 and CL2 mRNAs are widely expressed in the central nervous system, both in adults and in embryos. A, Northern blot analysis of mouse CL1, CL2, and CLr mRNAs. 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs was loaded for each lane in both an adult tissue blot and an embryonic stage blot. Double-stranded DNA fragments shown in Fig. 1A (thin lines) were used as a template to generate 32P-labeled random primed probes. Multiple transcripts were detected for both CL1 and CL2 from embryonic day 11 (E11) forward and continued to be expressed in the brain up to adulthood. Little CLr expression was detected during embryonic stages, whereas in adult, strong expression was shown in the brain, kidney, and liver. B, in situ hybridization analysis of adult mouse parasagittal sections. Specific antisense signal was heavily detected for both CL1 and CL2 in neurons in the forebrain (olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum) and in the cerebellum, whereas specific signals for CLr were restricted to the forebrain, as detected using DIG-labeled cRNA probes prepared from templates as shown in Fig. 1A (solid lines). Only the DIG signal component was visualized. Control sense probes yielded little signals for CL1 and CL2. A weak background sense signal was visible with CLr, which however was negligible compared with the specific antisense signal. Scale bar, 5 mm. C, higher power views showed abundant specific antisense DIG labeling (blue) for CL1, CL2, and CLr in adult neurons in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus. Nuclei were counterstained by Kernechtrot staining (red) to allow identification of cell layers. Scale bar, 0.5 mm. D, in situ hybridization of mouse E17.5 embryonic sections showed abundant antisense signals throughout the embryonic brain and the spinal cord both for CL1 and CL2, but not for CLr. Note the presence in embryos of non-negligible (presumed nonspecific) amounts of sense signals in the peripheral organs. Only the DIG signal was visualized. The results shown are representative of multiple independent sets of experiments.

Antibodies used were: rabbit anti-Myc polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-β-tubulin monoclonal (Sigma), and Alexa488- or Alexa555-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescent images were acquired using an Olympus DP-70 charge-coupled device camera (Fig. 4) or a Zeiss LSM510META confocal microscope (Supplemental Fig. S2).

https://openalex.org/W2072045758,"Nitroalkane compounds are widely used in chemical industry and are also produced by microorganisms and plants. Some nitroalkanes have been demonstrated to be carcinogenic, and enzymatic oxidation of nitroalkanes is of considerable interest. 2-Nitropropane dioxygenases from Neurospora crassa and Williopsis mrakii (Hansenula mrakii), members of one family of the nitroalkane-oxidizing enzymes, contain FMN and FAD, respectively. The enzymatic oxidation of nitroalkanes by 2-nitropropane dioxygenase operates by an oxidase-style catalytic mechanism, which was recently shown to involve the formation of an anionic flavin semiquinone. This represents a unique case in which an anionic flavin semiquinone has been experimentally observed in the catalytic pathway for oxidation catalyzed by a flavin-dependent enzyme. Here we report the first crystal structure of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two forms: a binary complex with FMN and a ternary complex with both FMN and 2-nitropropane. The structure identifies His152 as the proposed catalytic base, thus providing a structural framework for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism.

The structure identifies His152 as the proposed catalytic base, thus providing a structural framework for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism. Nitroalkanes are widely used in industry, because they are useful as intermediate compounds in chemical synthesis (1Ballini R. Barboni L. Giarlo G. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 9173-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 2Hanessian C. Pham V. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2975-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). They are also synthesized by various organisms. Many antibiotics, e.g. chloramphenicol and azomycin, contain nitro groups, and many leguminous plants produce nitro toxins such as 3-nitro-1-propionic acid and 3-nitro-1-propanol (3Kido T. Tanizawa K. Inagaki K. Yoshimura T. Ishida M. Hashizume K. Soda K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 2549-2554Google Scholar).

Hiraku Y. Kojima N. Kawanishi S. Mutat. Res. 2001; 479: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enzymatic oxidation of nitroalkanes into less toxic species can therefore be exploited for use in bioremediation. 2-Nitropropane dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.32), one of the nitroalkaneoxidizing enzyme families, catalyzes oxidative denitrification of nitroalkanes to their corresponding carbonyl compounds and nitrites. To date, 2-nitropropane dioxygenase has been isolated from a fungus Neurospora crassa (12Little H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 347-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a yeast Williopsis mrakii (Hansenula mrakii) (13Tchorzewski M. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The two enzymes have similar molecular masses of ∼40 kDa, but their prosthetic groups are different. FMN and FAD are found in the N. crassa and W. mrakii (H. mrakii) enzymes, respectively (14Gorlatova N. Tchorzewski M. Kurihara T. Soda K. Esaki N. Appl. Environ.

The ncd-2 gene encoding for 2-nitropropane dioxygenase in N. crassa has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (16Francis K. Russell B. Gadda G. J. Biol.

A steady-state kinetic analysis showed that the preferred substrates for the enzyme are anionic nitronates as compared with neutral nitroalkanes and that the enzyme has broad substrate specificity that is independent of substrate size (16Francis K. Russell B. Gadda G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5195-5204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been shown that 2-nitropropane dioxygenase operates through an oxidase-style catalytic mechanism, in which substrate oxidation occurs prior to and independently from reaction with oxygen, via the formation of an enzyme-bound anionic flavin semiquinone (16Francis K.

Despite many interesting features, no three-dimensional structure has yet been reported for any 2-nitropropane dioxygenase. Because all previous biochemical works have been done on the enzymes from N. crassa and W. mrakii (H. mrakii), the genomic DNAs of N. crassa and W. mrakii (H. mrakii) were not commercially available. Therefore, we chose 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa as part of the laboratory-scale structural genomics project. P. aeruginosa 2-nitropropane dioxygenase is a 328-residue protein (Mr 34,819), showing 23% sequence identity to 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from N. crassa. It also shows significant levels of sequence similarity to putative 2-nitropropane dioxygenases from various sources. In this study, we have overexpressed 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from P. aeruginosa in E. coli, crystallized it, and solved its structure, representing the first structure of any 2-nitropropane dioxygenase. We describe the structure in two forms: (i) a binary complex with FMN and (ii) a ternary complex with FMN and 2-nitropropane. This study provides detailed structural information on the binding mode of the cofactor and substrate. The structure also suggests that the highly conserved His152 is the likely candidate for the catalytic base, thus allowing a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase family. Protein Expression and Purification—The PA1024 gene encoding 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from P. aeruginosa was amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 as template. The forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers were designed using the published genome sequence (17Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J. Brinkman F.S.

The underlined bases denote the NdeI and XhoI cleavage sites. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and was then inserted into the NdeI/XhoI-digested expression vector pET-21a(+) (Novagen). This vector construction adds an eight-residue tag (LEHHHHHH) to the C terminus of the gene product to facilitate protein purification. The recombinant enzyme was expressed in E. coli C41(DE3) cells (18Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar) using Luria-Bertani broth. Protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were incubated for an additional 22 h at 20 °C following growth to mid-log phase at 37 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl) containing 50 mm imidazole. The crude lysate was centrifuged at ∼36,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was applied to a Ni+-chelated HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with the lysis buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Next, gel filtration was performed on a HiLoad XK 16 Superdex 200 prep-grade column (Amersham Biosciences) that was previously equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 100 mm sodium chloride. At the third chromatography step, the protein was loaded onto a mono Q HR5/5 ion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) that was previously equilibrated with buffer A, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1.0 m sodium chloride. The selenomethionine (SeMet) 3The abbreviations used are: SeMet, selenomethionine; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous diffraction; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s., root mean square. -substituted protein was expressed in E. coli B834(DE3) cells, using the M9 cell culture medium containing extra amino acids. The procedure for purifying the SeMet-substituted protein was the same except for the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol in all buffers used during purification steps. Enzyme Assay and Mutagenesis—2-Nitropropane-dioxygenase activity was assayed with 10 mm 2-nitropropane (anionic form) as a substrate. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C in a final volume of 1 ml of Britton-Robinson's buffer (pH 6.5) (a mixture of 16 mm phosphoric acid, 16 mm acetic acid, and 16 mm boric acid, whose pH is adjusted with NaOH), and the amount of nitrite was determined with sulfanilamide and N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm (19Kido T. Soda K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of nitrite per minute. Protein concentrations were measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. H152A and S288A mutants were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Crystallization—Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 24 °C by mixing equal volumes (2 μl each) of the protein solution (at 13 mg ml-1 concentration in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm sodium chloride) and the reservoir solution. To grow native crystals, we used a reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 m HEPES at pH 7.0, 5% (w/v) tacsimate at pH 7.0, and 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5000. Crystals grew to approximate dimensions of 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.07 mm within a day. To grow crystals of the native protein complexed with 2-nitropropane (neutral form), 160 mm 2-nitropropane solution (dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm sodium chloride) was mixed with the protein solution in a 1:20 volume ratio, resulting in an ∼24-fold molar excess of 2-nitropropane over the enzyme. The protein mixed with 2-nitropropane was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C before crystallization. Crystals of 2-nitropropane-bound form grew under identical reservoir conditions as the native crystals within a day. The SeMet-substituted protein was crystallized under conditions identical to those for the native crystals except for the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol in the protein solution. The crystals of the SeMet-substituted grew to approximate dimensions of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.07 mm within a few days. X-ray Data Collection—Table 1 summarizes the statistics of data collection. A crystal of the SeMet-substituted protein was dipped into a cryoprotectant solution for a few seconds and then frozen in the cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. The cryoprotectant solution consisted of 0.1 m HEPES at pH 7.0, 5% (w/v) tacsimate at pH 7.0, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5000, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at three different wavelengths using an Area Detector System Corporation Quantum 210 charge-coupled device detector at the experimental station NW12A of Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. The crystal was rotated through a total of 180° with a 1.0° oscillation range per frame. The raw data were processed and scaled using the program suit HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Seven of the eight expected selenium atoms in each monomer of the recombinant enzyme, except the SeMet residue at the N terminus of the polypeptide chain, were located with the program SOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar), and the selenium sites were used to calculate the phases with the program RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The MAD-phased electron density map was of sufficient quality to allow automatic model building by RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), giving an initial model that accounted for ∼36% of the backbone of the polypeptide chain with much of the sequence assigned. Subsequent manual model building was done using the program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallog. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The model was refined with the program CNS (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). Several rounds of model building, simulated annealing, positional refinement, and individual B-factor refinement were performed. Subsequently, this model was used to refine structures of the native enzyme as a binary complex with FMN and as a ternary complex with both FMN and 2-nitropropane. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. All of the models have excellent stereochemistry, as evaluated by the program PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Enzymatic Assay—When 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from P. aeruginosa was expressed in E. coli as a fusion with the C-terminal tag (LEHHHHHH), ∼20% of the expressed protein was present in the soluble fraction. The yield was typically ∼1.2 mg of the purified enzyme per liter of culture. This low yield was due to a considerable loss of the enzyme that occurred during the concentration step before gel filtration. Without concentrating the protein solution and by repeated gel filtration steps, we could significantly improve the yield (supplementary Table S1). The recombinant enzyme has a native molecular mass of ∼37 kDa (calculated monomer mass including the C-terminal tag = 35,884 Da), as estimated by our dynamic light scattering analysis. This result indicates that P. aeruginosa 2-nitropropane dioxygenase is monomeric in solution, unlike the homodimeric 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from N. crassa (16Francis K. Russell B. Gadda G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5195-5204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the recombinant enzyme in the wavelength range between 300 and 700 nm (Fig. S1A) resembles that of the glucose oxidase containing the oxidized flavin (27Massey V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 283-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our structures reveal the presence of non-covalently bound FMN (Figs. 1, 2, and S3). We have also found that the recombinant enzyme exhibits the enzyme dose-dependent 2-nitropropane dioxygenase activities (Fig. S1). Thiol compounds markedly inhibited the enzyme activity, whereas EDTA did not affect the enzyme activity (supplementary Table S2). These results are similar to those for N. crassa 2-nitropropane dioxygenase (14Gorlatova N. Tchorzewski M. Kurihara T. Soda K. Esaki N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Valeric acid, a competitive inhibitor of nitroalkane oxidase from Fusarium oxysporum (28Gadda G. Banerjee A. Fleming G.S. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Enzyme Inhib. 2001; 16: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), did not inhibit the P. aeruginosa 2-nitropropane dioxygenase activity (supplementary Table S2). We could also locate the substrate 2-nitropropane bound juxtaposed with FMN in the active site by co-crystallization. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the PA1024 gene product is a 2-nitropropane dioxygenase.FIGURE 2Binding of FMN and 2-nitropropane in the active site.

The model of the binary complex with FMN (Figs. 1 and 2) was refined against 8.0-2.00 Å data to Rwork and Rfree values of 19.1% and 22.7%, respectively (Table 1). The binary complex model (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2GJL) accounts for 324 residues (3-326), 288 water molecules, and 1 FMN molecule in the asymmetric unit. We have additionally determined the structure of the ternary complex with FMN and 2-nitropropane. The ternary complex model was refined against 15.0-2.30 Å data to Rwork and Rfree values of 18.8% and 23.2%, respectively (Table 1). The model (PDB code 2GJN) accounts for 324 amino acid residues (3-326), 224 water molecules, 1 FMN molecule, and 1 2-nitropropane molecule. N-terminal two residues (Met1-Gly2) and C-terminal two residues (Gly327-Val328) of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase, as well as the C-terminal eight-residue tag, are missing from both models, because there is no electron density. The models of binary and ternary complexes are highly similar to each other, with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.14 Å for 324 Cα atoms (residues 3-326). Pro82, which resides on a protruding loop between β3 and α4, shows the largest deviation (0.61 Å). This result indicates that there is no gross conformational change upon substrate binding. The monomeric enzyme has approximate dimensions of 40 Å × 40 Å × 60 Å (Fig. 1A). Its structure consists of two domains: a main domain (Met1-Pro211 and Glu299-Val328) and an inserted domain (Ile212-Asp298) (Fig. 1, A and C). The two domains are connected by two loops. The main domain is folded into the common (β/α)8-barrel (or triose phosphate isomerase barrel), with a central barrel of eight β-strands (β1-β8) surrounded by eight α-helices (α2-α8 and α15) (Fig. 1, A and C). The N-terminal region, including helix α1, covers the central channel of the barrel on the N-terminal side of the strands. The inserted domain resides between strand β8 and helix α15, the eighth strand-helix pair of the (β/α)8-barrel (Fig. 1). The N-terminal portion of the C-terminal helixα15 is located between helicesα2 andα8 of the (β/α)8-barrel, and its C-terminal portion protrudes out from the main body of the (β/α)8-barrel (Fig. 1C). The inserted domain consists of six α-helices (α9-α14), two antiparallel β-strands (β9-β10), and the loops connecting these secondary structure elements. The strand β10 is located at the interface between the two domains, making contacts with the long, winding loop between β6 and α7 (Fig. 1, A and C). This loop covers the FMN binding pocket on the C-terminal side of the strands in the (β/α)8-barrel. A long loop before helixα14 of the inserted domain buries the bound FMN (Fig. 1, A and C). Structural Similarities—A DALI structural similarity search (29Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) with the inserted domain did not reveal any similar structure. The highest Z-score is obtained with the mouse transport protein lin 7 homolog b fragment (PDB code 1Y74; an r.m.s. deviation of 2.8 Å for 37 equivalent Cα positions, a Z-score of 1.6, and a sequence identity of 5%). This result indicates that the inserted domain has a novel fold. The DALI search (29Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) with the main domain revealed many similar structures, as one can expect from its common (β/α)8-barrel fold. The highest Z-score is obtained with the inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas fetus (PDB code 1AK5; an r.m.s. deviation of 2.3 Å for 213 equivalent Cα positions, a Z-score of 21.0, and a sequence identity of"

https://openalex.org/W2108048129,"We have identified five structural rearrangements in GroEL induced by the ordered binding of ATP and GroES. The first discernable rearrangement (designated T → R1) is a rapid, cooperative transition that appears not to be functionally communicated to the apical domain. In the second (R1 → R2) step, a state is formed that binds GroES weakly in a rapid, diffusion-limited process. However, a second optical signal, carried by a protein substrate bound to GroEL, responds neither to formation of the R2 state nor to the binding of GroES. This result strongly implies that the substrate protein remains bound to the inner walls of the initially formed GroEL·GroES cavity, and is not yet displaced from its sites of interaction with GroEL. In the next rearrangement (R2·GroES → R3·GroES) the strength of interaction between GroEL and GroES is greatly enhanced, and there is a large and coincident loss of fluorescence-signal intensity in the labeled protein substrate, indicating that there is either a displacement from its binding sites on GroEL or at least a significant change of environment. These results are consistent with a mechanism in which the shift in orientation of GroEL apical domains between that seen in the apo-protein and stable GroEL·GroES complexes is highly ordered, and transient conformational intermediates permit the association of GroES before the displacement of bound polypeptide. This ensures efficient encapsulation of the polypeptide within the GroEL central cavity underneath GroES.

The function of the GroE molecular chaperone is to enhance the efficiency of protein folding, whether the substrate is a newly synthesized protein chain or a denatured molecule that has unfolded in response to environmental conditions (1Sigler P.B.

Wiley-Vch Verlag, Weinheim, Germany2004: 683-708Google Scholar). This dual role means that GroE is expressed constitutively to fulfill the former function and is inducible during heat-shock, when its concentration in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm is raised 5-fold (5Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rüdiger S. Röder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The ability of this chaperone to increase the productive folding yield, irrespective of either the sequence of the chain or the final shape of the folded substrate, is mechanistically intriguing, as is the coupling of this folding activity with the hydrolysis of ATP. The GroE chaperone comprises two protein assemblies. The largest, GroEL (sometimes referred to as Cpn60, a chaperonin with a subunit molecular mass of 60 kDa), is constructed from fourteen identical subunits arranged in two rings, stacked back-to-back, to form two large cavities separated by a central septum but with wide openings allowing access to the environment (6Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). These basket-like cavities are capable of encompassing an unfolded protein substrate of ∼60 kDa chain molecular mass (7Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R.

Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The second protein component, GroES (sometimes referred to as Cpn10, a chaperonin with a subunit molecular mass of 10 kDa), is a single ring of seven members that forms a dome-like structure of a diameter that is matched to the width of the GroEL opening (9Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In the presence of adenine nucleotides, GroES binds preferentially to one of the GroEL rings to act as a lid that can close off one of the central cavities to create a capsule (10Saibil H. Dong Z. Wood S. der Mauer A. Nature. 1991; 353: 25-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). It is within this capsule, or cage, that substrate proteins are able to fold, relatively unencumbered by interactions with the protein surfaces that constitute its walls (7Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M.

Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). More salient to the biological function of the machine, the encapsulated protein chain is not free to form interactions with other protein molecules in a similarly unfolded state, a process that might otherwise lead to the formation of inactive aggregates (12Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 13Badcoe I.G. Smith C.J. Wood S. Halsall D.J. Holbrook J.J. Lund P. Clarke A.R.

If these are not recoverable, other than by hydrolytic breakdown and de novo re-synthesis, it is a waste of the synthetic efforts of the cell. Hence, preventing irreversible aggregation, albeit at the cost of ATP hydrolysis, is a useful process. GroEL, GroES, and ATP are the fundamental requirements for the complete, energy-transducing ATPase in the assisted-folding reaction (12Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Our current understanding of the principle steps that constitute the reaction cycle are summarized in Fig. 1. As far as is currently understood, there are five rules that govern the operation of the cycle: (a) the GroES co-protein cannot bind to a ring devoid of nucleotide (17Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (b) GroES binds more rapidly to an ATP-occupied ring than to one occupied by ADP (18Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Hayer-Hartl M.K. Martin J. Hartl F.-U. Science. 1995; 269: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Rye H.S.

Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar); (c) the binding of seven ATP molecules to one ring leads to a weakening of binding to the other, i.e. there is negative homotropic cooperativity between the rings (18Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar); (d) mixed complexes with one ring occupied by ATP and the other by ADP are stable, but cannot undergo the hydrolytic step owing to ADP on one ring acting as a non-competitive inhibitor of hydrolysis on the other (22Kad N.M. Ranson N.A. Cliff M.J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); and (e) the binding of GroES to an ATP-occupied ring commits the nucleotide to hydrolysis (23Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Much previous work shows that the substrate proteins are transiently ensnared in the GroES-capped cavity during this ATPase cycle and have a dwell time of tens of seconds in which the protein substrate has a probability of folding dictated by the rate constant of the spontaneous process (24Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 25Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Because encapsulation cannot rely upon the random chance of an unfolded substrate happening to be in the cavity at the same time that the GroES lid comes on, there must be a mechanism by which the substrate is concentrated in the hole before the lid can provide the means of forming the cage. The structural picture that we have at the moment, derived from both x-ray and electron microscopy techniques, shows that in static or, at least, long-lived species, the binding of GroES and substrate are rather exclusive, i.e. they share binding surfaces (10Saibil H. Dong Z. Wood S. der Mauer A. Nature. 1991; 353: 25-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 27Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H.E. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 28Chen L. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Taken at face value this means that the protein substrate has to dissociate before GroES can bind. If this is true, then there must be a conformational change that obligatorily displaces the protein substrate, which then has no time to diffuse from the locale before GroES rapidly caps the cavity and thus achieves encapsulation. However, an alternative mechanism can be proposed that proceeds through an intermediate state, as yet unseen by structural methods nor inferred from kinetics, in which the protein substrate remains bound to the walls of GroEL at the same time that GroES associates with its seven sites on the apical domains. This pathway postulates that there is a transient conformational intermediate state for GroEL in which the binding of substrate protein chain and GroES are not mutually exclusive, i.e. GroES binds before displacement of the substrate. There then must be a further step in which the substrate is shed from its binding site on the apical domain and allowed to fold unhindered. It is difficult to distinguish between these two plausible mechanisms except by using time-resolved techniques that can report specific events in the millisecond time range. Previous work on the structural rearrangement of GroEL induced by the binding of ATP shows that the picture is complex, even in the absence of GroES, with four distinct transitions before the nucleotide is hydrolyzed (29Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7083-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Cliff M.J. Kad N. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Inobe T. Arai M. Nakao M. Ito K. Kamagata K. Makio T. Ameniya Y. Kihara H. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These re-organizations of GroEL are spread over the several milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds time-scales and are thus in the time window of stopped-flow techniques. In an attempt to resolve the molecular events that constitute the encapsulation phase of the GroE chaperone mechanism we have used fast-mixing methods combined with fluorescence labeling to determine the effect of GroES on the ATP-induced structural rearrangements in GroEL, including the point at which GroES associates. This is combined with time-resolved data that monitor the response of a label attached to the protein substrate when ATP-induced structural rearrangements occur in GroEL. The combination of these two lines of enquiry is used to correlate the dynamics of the protein substrate and of GroES. Standard Conditions—The standard reaction buffer in all experiments, except where stated otherwise, was 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, and 20 mm MgCl2. Proteins and Reagents—The W485-GroEL mutant was a kind gift from Dr. Peter Lund (Birmingham, UK). The mutant GroEL and GroES were purified as described previously (30Cliff M.J. Kad N. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin was obtained from Sigma. ATP and ADP were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Nucleotide concentrations were confirmed spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 15,300 m-1 cm-1 for adenine at 260 nm. All other reagents were obtained from BDH and were analytical grade. Fluorescent Labeling of CM-LA—A 10 mm stock solution of 5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonyl chloride (dansyl chloride) in acetonitrile was added to 100 μm CM-LA 5The abbreviations used are: CM-LA, reduced and carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin; HNBB, 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide. in phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at a ratio of 1:10. This pH was chosen to selectively label the α-amino group at the N terminus of CM-LA rather than the ϵ-amino group of lysine. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min in the dark before being dialyzed overnight against 100 volumes of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 mg/ml activated charcoal. The extent of labeling was determined by absorbance using a molar extinction coefficient of 3400 m-1 cm-1 at 335 nm. On average one dansyl group was attached per CM-LA polypeptide. Chemical Modification of the Tryptophan Residues in CM-LA—2-Hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide (HNBB, also known as Koshland Reagent I) reacts in neutral and acid solutions with only tryptophan residues (37Koshland Jr, D.E. Karkhanis Y.D. Latham H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1448-1450Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar) modifying the indole group, which in turn alters its spectroscopic properties. A 0.1 m stock of HNBB was made in 5% dried acetone before mixing with an equal volume of 200 μm CM-LA in 10 mm sodium phosphate at pH 6.0 in the dark for 2 h. The mixed sample was then dialyzed against 200 volumes of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, in the dark. HNBB activity was confirmed by the loss of tryptophan fluorescence upon excitation at 295 nm. Stopped-flow Time-resolved Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurements—All stopped-flow experiments were performed in the standard buffer using an Applied Photophysics SX-17MV stopped-flow fluorometer. W485-GroEL was excited using monochromatic light at 295 nm, and the resulting fluorescence was selected with a WG320 filter which cuts off all light below 320 nm. All reactions were performed at 25 °C, and at least three transients were averaged for any data point. Fluorescence measurements of the dansyl-CM-LA were made using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and fluorescence emission selected using a WG420 filter, which cuts off light below 420 nm. Analytical Methods—All data fitting was carried out using the least-squares method of Marquardt (43Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) using the Grafit 5.0 fitting program (Erithacus software). The quadratic tight ligand binding equation (Equation 1) used in Fig. 5 is, F=(E0+Kd+L)+(E0+Kd+L)2−4E0L2E0×(Fmax−Fmin)+Fmin(Eq. 1) where F is the measured fluorescence, Eo is the initial concentration of ligand binding sites, Kd is the dissociation constant, L is the total ligand concentration, and Fmax and Fmin are the maximum and minimum fluorescence intensities observed, respectively. All parameters during the fitting procedures were allowed to float where possible, although it should also be noted that where the magnitude of the rate constants for successive phases are similar, then the determination of both rate constants and fluorescence amplitudes are not accurate. This was particularly the case when determining the rate constants and amplitudes for the R3 → R3* and R3* → R4 transitions at low concentrations of ATP. This affects the degree of accuracy of the value of K½ reported in Fig. 5B. Discrete Events in the Ordered Addition of ATP and GroES to GroEL—The intrinsic fluorescence of an engineered tryptophan (Trp-485) in GroEL can be used to report conformational events induced by the binding of ATP (30Cliff M.J. Kad N. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Inobe T. Arai M. Nakao M. Ito K. Kamagata K. Makio T. Ameniya Y. Kihara H. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This experiment was performed by rapidly mixing W485-GroEL (hereafter referred to just as GroEL for simplicity) with a solution of ATP using a stopped-flow apparatus and recording time-resolved changes in fluorescence (Fig. 2A, GroEL plus ATP). To investigate the effect of GroES on this reaction the experiment was repeated, this time challenging GroEL with a mixture of ATP and GroES (Fig. 2A, GroEL plus GroES plus ATP). In both reactions the transients observed are complex. ATP alone induces three, easily resolved kinetic phases (two fluorescence quenches and a subsequent fluorescence enhancement), whereas ATP and GroES together induce four kinetic phases (three quenches and a slower enhancement). In both cases they are also preceded by a very rapid signal enhancement, which represents the cooperative T → R transition but which is not fully resolvable at the ATP concentration and temperature used in this experiment (30Cliff M.J. Kad N. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Inobe T. Arai M. Nakao M. Ito K. Kamagata K. Makio T. Ameniya Y. Kihara H. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The data in the absence of GroES can be fitted optimally to a four-phase mechanism (30Cliff M.J. Kad N. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); however, the presence of GroES introduces an extra quench phase (see fitting residuals in Fig. 2, B and C). Hence, the full description of the ATP-driven system in the absence of GroES can be written as in Scheme 1, T↔R1↔R2↔R3↔R4SCHEME 1 and the ATP- and GroES-driven system is described by Scheme 2. T↔R1↔R2↔R3↔R3∗↔R4SCHEME 2 Because the final kinetic phase observed in the presence and absence of GroES is a fluorescence enhancement, we have placed the additional kinetic phase observed in the presence of GroES after R3 giving rise to the R3* intermediate species. To determine the point along this pathway at which GroES associates we examined the influence of GroES on each of the kinetic phases. The rate of the fast T → R transition (observable here at 150 μm ATP) was unperturbed by the presence of GroES (Fig. 2D). In addition, the ATP dependence of the first order observed rate constant of the first fluorescence quench phase (the R1 → R2 transition) was also unaffected by the presence of GroES (Fig. 3A). In the presence of GroES kobs for the R1 → R2 transition shows a bi-sigmoid dependence on ATP concentration, as indeed was the case in the absence of GroES (30Cliff M.J. Kad N. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This was previously assigned to the binding of ATP to first one heptameric ring and then the second heptameric ring, supported by the fact that the second sigmoid could be abolished by binding ADP to one of the rings prior to mixing with ATP (Ref. 30Cliff M.J. Kad N. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and Fig. 3B). This was also the case in the presence of GroES (shown in Fig. 3B and indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 3A). However, upon examining the amplitude of the R1 → R2 phase as a function of the concentration of ATP, it can be seen that it was clearly influenced by the presence of the co-protein (Fig. 3C). The ATP dependence of the amplitude of this phase fits optimally to the Hill equation with an K½ of 13.0 (±0.36) μm and a Hill coefficient of 2.49 (±0.14) in the absence of GroES and K½ of 6.85 (±0.10) μm and a Hill coefficient of 2.28 (±0.06) in the presence of GroES. This effect can only be explained by the binding of GroES to the R2 state, thereby increasing the apparent binding affinity for ATP and shifting the amplitude curve to the left. Thus the above, qualitative analysis leads to the tentative conclusion that GroES interacts with the R2 state. From these data we can thus infer that the reaction scheme (Reaction 1) in the presence of ATP and GroES is as follows. T⋅ATP⇄R1⋅ATP⇄R2⋅ATP⇄R2⋅ATP⋅GroESamp;↑↓ amp;R3⋅ATP⋅GroESamp;↑↓ amp;R3∗⋅ATP⋅GroESamp;↑↓ amp;R4⋅ATP⋅GroESamp;REACTION 1 This interpretation assumes that if GroES binds to a particular state it will affect its optical or kinetic properties. It is possible that GroES binds before the GroEL conformation acquires the R2 conformation, but that the binding is optically and kinetically silent. However, with such a large protein cofactor that is known to have very large effects on the conformation of GroEL, this appears unlikely. Dependence of Observed Rate Constants on the Concentration of ATP—We next assessed the effect of the concentration of ATP on the observed rate constants for the nucleotide-induced rearrangements (Fig. 4), so that we could compare the responses of the system to ATP in the presence and absence of GroES. As described in the previous section, the first enhancement (T → R1) is entirely unaffected by the presence of GroES, and the first quench phase (R1 → R2) is affected only in its amplitude, and there is no effect on rate. The second quench phase, designated (R2 → R3), peaked at a rate constant of ∼14 s-1 in the presence of GroES (Fig. 4A); compared with ∼6 s-1 for the second quench in the absence of GroES (30Cliff M.J. Kad N. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The third quench phase (R3 → R3*) did not occur at all in the absence of GroES and had a maximum first-order rate constant of ∼1 s-1 at saturating concentrations of ATP (see Fig. 4B). The final kinetic phase, a fluorescence enhancement phase (R3* → R4), showed no variation in rate as ATP concentration increased, being a constant 0.26 s-1 in the presence of GroES (Fig. 4C). This compares with a rate constant of ∼0.6 s-1 for the final enhancement phase in the absence of GroES. However, the amplitude of the R3* → R4 phase increased with the concentration of ATP and showed half-saturation at a concentration of ∼140 μm (see Fig. 4D). Progressive Tightening of the GroEL·GroES Complex after the Initial Interaction—By maintaining a constant concentration of ATP (1 mm) and varying the concentration of GroES we were able to use phase-amplitude analysis to make an estimate of the GroES binding affinity as the GroEL molecule progresses through its ATP-driven rearrangements (Fig. 5). It can be seen that the amplitude of the second quench phase (R2 → R3) is enhanced as the concentration of GroES is increased from sub-stoichiometric to super-stoichiometric levels (Fig. 5A). This phase of the reaction represents the process in Reaction 2. R2⋅ATP+GroES↔R2⋅ATP⋅GroES↔R3⋅ATP⋅GroESREACTION 2 If the first binding step is represented by the following dissociation constant (Equation 1), KdR2(ES)=[R2⋅ATP]⋅[GroES][R2⋅ATP⋅GroES](Eq. 2) and the second by the unimolecular equilibrium constant K(2,3) (Equation 2), where, K(2,3)=[R3⋅ATP⋅GroES][R2⋅ATP⋅GroES](Eq. 3) then the apparent overall binding affinity reported by the amplitude plot (Kd1ES(app)) is given by Equation 3. Kd1ES(app)=KdR2(ES)(1+K(2,3))(Eq. 4) The amplitude data in Fig. 5A can be fitted to the tight-binding equation with Kd1,ES(app) = 190 (±80) nm, although it must be stated that these data do not accurately resolve this binding affinity, a fact reflected in the degree of error. A similar kind of analysis can be performed for the last two kinetic phases, R3 → R3* and R3* → R4. The fluorescence amplitude of the R3 → R3* phase, again at a fixed ATP concentration of 1 mm, also increases with increasing GroES concentration and can be fitted to determine the apparent affinity of GroES at this stage of the reaction. Although it is difficult to resolve accurate data at low concentrations of GroES, the data in Fig. 5B fit optimally to the tight-binding equation with Kd2,ES(app) = 15.0 (±14.1) nm, ∼10-fold tighter than Kd1,ES(app). Although the effective binding affinity is poorly determined, we take these data as evidence that there is a tightening of the GroES interaction as the GroEL molecule progresses from the R3 to the R3* conformation. The presence of increasing concentrations of GroES also enhanced the amplitude of the R3* → R4 phase (Fig. 5C). The data fit optimally to the tight-binding equation with a Kd3,ES(app) = 4.39 (±2.86) nm. This probably represents a further tightening of the GroEL-GroES interaction as the reaction progresses from R3* → R4, although the errors in fitting the amplitudes of multiexponentials are considerable. The Dynamics of a Bound Polypeptide; the Experimental System—The binding of ATP weakens the affinity of GroEL for polypeptide (13Badcoe I.G. Smith C.J. Wood S. Halsall D.J. Holbrook J.J. Lund P.

Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); therefore, the conundrum arises as to why the initial binding of ATP to a GroEL·protein substrate complex does not cause unfolded polypeptide to be released into the bulk solution before GroES has associated, especially because the binding sites for the two ligands overlap on the GroEL apical domains. Is GroES association so rapid as to prevent significant loss of polypeptide, or has GroEL evolved a mechanism to ensure efficient capture of the polypeptide into the central cavity beneath GroES? One way to address this question is to determine at which point along the ATP-induced allosteric pathway the polypeptide “senses” the conformational rearrangements in GroEL. Complications in the kinetics caused by the refolding of the protein substrate were avoided by using α-lactalbumin, which had been reduced and carboxymethylated (CM-LA). The removal of Ca2+ and the reduction of the disulfide bonds in α-lactalbumin resulted in the protein fully unfolding, and its interaction with GroEL has been well characterized (33Hayer-Hartl M.K.

https://openalex.org/W2071108414,"Ime2p is a meiosis-specific protein kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that controls multiple steps in meiosis. Although Ime2p is functionally related to the Cdc28p cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), no cyclin binding partners that regulate its activities have been identified. The sequence of the Ime2p catalytic domain is similar to CDKs and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Ime2p is activated by phosphorylation of its activation loop in a Cak1p-dependent fashion and is subsequently phosphorylated on multiple residues as cells progress through meiosis. In this study, we show that Ime2p purified from meiotic cells is phosphorylated on Thr242 and Tyr244 in its activation loop and on Ser520 and Ser625 in its C terminus. Ime2p autophosphorylates on threonine in its activation loop in vitro consistent with autophosphorylation of Thr242 playing a role in its activation. Moreover, autophosphorylation in cis is required for Ime2p to become hyperphosphorylated. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal serines is not essential to sporulation. However, Ime2p C-terminal phosphorylation site mutants genetically interact with components of the FEAR network that controls exit from meiosis I. These data suggest that Ime2p plays a role in controlling the exit from meiosis I and demonstrate that a phospho-modification pathway regulates Ime2p during the different phases of meiotic development.

Meiosis is the program by which diploid cells generate haploids. It shares several key processes with mitosis including DNA replication and chromosome segregation; however, its successful completion requires a series of processes unique to meiosis. These meiosis-specific processes include homolog pairing, synaptonemal-complex formation, genetic recombination, and a reductional division (MI). Subsequently, an equational (mitosis-like) division (MII) occurs without an intervening round of DNA replication. Completion of MII is linked to specialized differentiation programs that produce gametes capable of sexual fusion. Meiosis-specific processes are induced in part, through transcriptional programs that express meiotic genes as they are needed. These programs also express signaling molecules that are required to coordinate meiotic processes and superimpose meiotic regulation on the mitotic cell cycle machinery. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae multiple meiotic processes are regulated by the Ime2p meiosis-specific protein kinase. Ime2p is functionally related to Cdc28p, the sole essential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; FEAR, CDC fourteen early anaphase release; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; HA, hemagglutinin. 2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; FEAR, CDC fourteen early anaphase release; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; HA, hemagglutinin. required for mitosis and meiosis. IME2 transcription begins shortly after meiotic induction and increases further around the time of the chromosomal divisions. This biphasic accumulation of IME2 mRNA first requires Ime1p, the transcription factor specific for the early class of meiosis-specific promoters (1Mitchell A.P. Driscoll S.E. Smith H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2104-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Its second phase of transcription requires Ndt80p, the transcription factor specific for middle sporulation gene promoters (2Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). After induction, Ime2p first positively regulates early gene expression through Ime1p. During this time, Ime2p controls meiotic S phase by functionally replacing some, but not all, of the Cdc28p mitotic S-phase-promoting roles (3Honigberg S.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Benjamin K.R. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1524-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5Guttmann-Raviv N. Boger-Nadjar E. Edri I. Kassir Y. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, whereas Cdc28p is required to target the Sic1p CDK inhibitor for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in mitosis, Ime2p is required for this role in meiosis. During the early phase of sporulation, Ime2p also phosphorylates replication protein A (6Clifford D.M. Stark K.E. Gardner K.E. Hoffmann-Benning S. Brush G.S. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1826-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Ime2p subsequently promotes the meiotic divisions at least in part by positively regulating Ndt80p through direct phosphorylation (4Benjamin K.R. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1524-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Sopko R. Raithatha S. Stuart D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7024-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, genetic evidence suggests that Ime2p negatively regulates Sum1p, a repressor protein that functions in opposition to Ndt80p (8Pak J. Segall J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6417-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Ime2p also plays a role in terminating early gene expression by promoting the destruction of Ime1p (9Guttmann-Raviv N. Martin S. Kassir Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Later in the program, Ime2p has been proposed to negatively regulate Cdh1p, a targeting subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and may thus regulate chromosome segregation by modulating the activity of this ubiquitin ligase (10Bolte M. Steigemann P. Braus G.H. Irniger S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4385-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A subset of Ime2p function may be carried out (albeit inefficiently) by Cdc28p in ime2 mutants (5Guttmann-Raviv N. Boger-Nadjar E. Edri I. Kassir Y. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These collective observations demonstrate that Ime2p regulates multiple meiotic processes. Although Ime2p is functionally related to Cdc28p, no cyclin binding partners have been identified that regulate its activity, and relatively little is known about how its multiple functions in meiosis are controlled. Ime2p is degraded shortly after MII is completed (4Benjamin K.R. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1524-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-mediated destruction of Ime2p occurs in a Grr1p-dependent manner when glucose, which inhibits meiosis, is added to sporulating cells (11Purnapatre K. Gray M. Piccirillo S. Honigberg S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that glucose can inhibit the Ime2p activity through the Gpa2p heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (12Donzeau M. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6110-6119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies it was shown that Ime2p is phosphorylated early in sporulation and hyperphosphorylated during middle sporulation (4Benjamin K.R. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1524-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 13Schindler K. Benjamin K.R. Martin A. Boglioli A. Herskowitz I. Winter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8718-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Ime2p contains a TXY motif in its activation loop that is similar to the activation loops found in mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Mutations of either the Thr or Tyr lead to a decrease in Ime2p activity suggesting that these might be sites of activating phosphorylation (13Schindler K. Benjamin K.R. Martin A. Boglioli A. Herskowitz I. Winter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8718-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation and activation of Ime2p requires Cak1p, which also activates Cdc28p by phosphorylation of its activation loop. Aspects of this mechanism for activating Ime2p may be evolutionarily conserved in higher eukaryotes since ICK, a mammalian protein kinase with sequence similarity to Ime2p, can be directly phosphorylated by yeast Cak1p (14Fu Z. Schroeder M.J. Shabanowitz J. Kaldis P. Togawa K. Rustgi A.K. Hunt D.F. Sturgill T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6047-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Full modification of Ime2p is dependent on its own catalytic activity and Ime2p autophosphorylates in vitro (13Schindler K. Benjamin K.R. Martin A. Boglioli A. Herskowitz I. Winter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8718-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cdc28p activity is controlled by multiple mechanisms including phosphorylation and the binding of activators and inhibitors. During vegetative growth, Cdc28p activity is down-regulated to allow cells to exit from the mitotic division (15Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Tinker-Kulberg R.L. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2803-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). There are two pathways that work in conjunction to control exit from mitosis: the cdc fourteen early anaphase release (FEAR) and the mitotic exit network (MEN) (15Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Tinker-Kulberg R.L. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2803-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Stegmeier F. Visintin R. Amon A. Cell. 2002; 108: 207-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). These pathways negatively regulate Cdc28p by controlling release of the Cdc14p dual-specificity phosphatase from the nucleolus. Cdc28p must be active for execution of both meiotic divisions but it must also be down-regulated between meiosis I (MI) and meiosis II (MII) (4Benjamin K.R. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1524-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 17Marston A.L. Lee B.H. Amon A. Dev Cell. 2003; 4: 711-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Data from several groups indicate that FEAR, and not MEN, is central to regulating the exit from MI (18Marston A.L. Amon A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 19Kamieniecki R.J. Liu L. Dawson D.S. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Buonomo S.B. Rabitsch K.P. Fuchs J. Gruber S. Sullivan M. Uhlmann F. Petronczki M. Toth A. Nasmyth K. Dev Cell. 2003; 4: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells harboring mutations in the FEAR network (SLK19, SPO12, and CDC14) are defective in downregulating Cdc28p and disassembling the MI spindle. These cells complete a mixed MI/MII division on the persistent MI spindle and generate dyad rather than tetrad spores. Because cells lacking IME2 block early in the program more is known about its earlier roles than its later roles and it is unclear whether it participates in FEAR network regulation. Ime2p appears to be required for meiotic M phase; however, it is unclear how its activity is controlled during the meiotic divisions. Here, we used mass spectrometry of Ime2p purified from meiotic cells and phosphopeptide mapping of in vitro autophosphorylation reactions to identify phosphoacceptor sites in Ime2p and address their significance in Ime2p regulation. We demonstrate that Thr242 and Tyr244 are phosphorylated in a Cak1p-dependent manner consistent with our previous genetic studies (13Schindler K. Benjamin K.R. Martin A. Boglioli A. Herskowitz I. Winter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8718-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that Ime2p autophosphorylates its activation loop. In addition, we found that the C-terminal regulatory domain of Ime2p is phosphorylated on Ser520 and Ser625 during a time in which cells are completing the meiotic divisions. Mutants lacking these phosphorylation sites show an increase in dyad formation and genetically interact with mutants in the FEAR network. These data provide insight into the mechanism of Ime2p activation and its regulation by phosphorylation during sporulation. Strain and Plasmid Construction—The yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. All strains except for those harboring the galactose-inducible IME2 plasmids are in the SK1 genetic background. The IME2 mutant alleles were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) of pAM4, pMRC5, and pCM1. The Ser246 codon was mutated from TCC to GCC. Codons Ser520 and Ser625 were changed to alanines by mutating TCA to GCC. These alleles were integrated in the chromosome by transforming the ime2::URA3 strain KBY443 (a gift from Kirsten Benjamin) with SacII/SmaI-digested pAM4-derived DNA and with SacII/KpnI-digested pCM1-derived DNA followed by selection of FOA-resistant colonies. Plasmid pCM1 was generated by subcloning a SpeI/KpnI fragment from pAM4 into pRS316 cut with SpeI and KpnI and pMRC5 was generated by subcloning a SalI/NotI fragment from pMR1 into pRS316 cut with SalI and NotI (13Schindler K.

(0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, plus nutrients essential for auxotrophic strains) or YEPA (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% potassium acetate). For synchronous sporulation, cells were grown in YEPA to an A600 of 0.3–0.5. Prior to sporulation, cells were harvested, washed in SM (2% potassium acetate plus 10 μg of adenine, 5 μg of histidine, 30 μg of leucine, 7.5 μg of lysine, 10 μg of tryptophan, and 5 μg of uracil per ml) and resuspended in SM at 2 OD/ml. DNA Staining and Analysis—To monitor the meiotic divisions, 1 OD of cells was taken at various times, fixed in 90% EtOH, and stained with 1 μg/ml of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The completion of MI and MII were scored by counting the proportion of cells containing two DAPI-staining bodies and more than two DAPI-staining bodies observed by fluorescence microscopy. One hundred cells in 3–7 independent isolates per mutant were analyzed. Protein Isolation and Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (13Schindler K. Benjamin K.R. Martin A. Boglioli A. Herskowitz I. Winter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8718-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, run at 12 mV, transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore), and blocked overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20 plus I-Block (Tropix). Antibody staining was performed for 1 h at room temperature with a polyclonal antibody against Ime2p (1:10,000) (21Sia R.A. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After washing, the membrane was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Promega, 1:7,500). The Myc epitope on Ime2p was detected with a 9E10 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1,000) and the HA epitope was detected with a HA.11 monoclonal antibody (Babco; 1:5,000) and a secondary anti-mouse (Promega; 1:5,000). The secondary antibodies were conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and were detected by chemiluminescence (CDP-Star, Tropix). Kinase Assays—Ime2p-myc kinase assays were conducted as described previously (13Schindler K. Benjamin K.R. Martin A. Boglioli A. Herskowitz I. Winter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8718-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 ODs of sporulating cells were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen at 2-h post-induction. Next, the cells were lysed by 3 cycles of 1-min bursts of bead beating followed by 2 min on ice (500 μl of 0.5 μm glass beads, Sigma) in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8.8 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 mg/ml antipain, 0.1 μg/ml pefabloc SC, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein from clarified supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation of Ime2p-myc with 20 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) and 60 μl of anti-Myc antibody (A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 200 μg/ml) or anti-HA antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 200 μg/ml) by gentle mixing at 4 °C for 8–24 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected and washed three times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2). The immunoprecipitates were stored in a 1:1 mixture of kinase buffer and 100% glycerol at –20 °C until processing. Desired amounts of sample were removed from the stock, washed in kinase buffer, and resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1 μm cold ATP. The reactions were terminated after a 30-min incubation at 30 °C with the addition of SDS gel loading buffer followed by boiling. Samples were resolved on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, dried, and processed by autoradiography or phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Ime2p-myc was isolated from sporulating cells by immunoprecipitation and autophosphorylated as described above. Protein isolation and hydrolysis was conducted as described by Boyle et al. (22Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Methods in Enzymology. 201. 1991: 110-149Google Scholar). The autophosphorylated material was eluted from a dried 7.5% acrylamide gel by shaking overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm NH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The eluted protein was concentrated by precipitation with 20% trichloroacetic acid and washed in cold acetone prior to hydrolysis in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 1 h. The hydrolyzed material was lyophilized and resuspended in 5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8 containing 60 μg/ml of cold phosphoamino acid standards (Sigma). 5–8 μls of each sample were spotted onto plastic-backed, cellulose TLC plates (Kodak). Ascending chromatography was performed in a brick TLC tank pre-equilibrated with isobutyric acid-0.5 m NH4OH (5:3, v/v). After drying, the cold standards were visualized with ninhydrin (0.25% in acetone; Sigma), baked at 65 °C for 15 min, and developed by either autoradiography or phosphorimaging. Phosphopeptide Mapping—Autophosphorylated Ime2p was isolated and concentrated as described above. After washing, the protein was oxidized in ice-cold performic acid at 0 °C for 1 h and lyophilized. Next, the protein was digested overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing either 10 μg of TPCK-trypsin or chymotrypsin (Worthington). Finally, the sample was lyophilized and washed several times in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid (88%), glacial acetic acid, and deionized water (25: 78:897, v/v/v)) before resuspension in 5 μl of pH 1.9 buffer. The sample was spotted onto glass-backed 100 μm 20 × 20 cm microcrystalline cellulose TLC plates (EM Scientific) along with 5 μl of 5 mg/ml ϵ-dinitrophenyl-lysine and 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol FF as a standard. First, the plate was subjected to electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer using a Hunter thin-layer electrophoresis unit 7000 (HTLE, CBS Scientific, Inc) for 45 min at 1.0 kV (10–15 mA). After drying, ascending chromatography was conducted in a glass-brick TLC tank pre-equilibrated with isobutyric acid, n-butyl alcohol, pyridine, acetic acid, and water (65:2:5:3:29). Phosphopeptides were detected by phosphorimaging, and exposure times were adjusted so that the spots were of equal intensities to compare wild-type and catalytically weakened Ime2p reactions. Protein Purification and Mass Spectrometry—Three liters of wild-type and cak1-Δ cells harboring a chromosomally-integrated allele of IME2-myc were grown overnight at 30 °C in YEPA to an OD of 0.5 prior to sporulation at 2 OD/ml in SM. After 7.5 h cells were harvested, washed, and concentrated in a small volume of ice-cold water plus 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (8.8 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 mg/ml antipain, 0.1 μg/ml pefabloc SC, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). The concentrated cells were frozen dropwise in liquid nitrogen prior to grinding into a fine powder with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and transferring into a 250-ml centrifuge tube (Corning 430776). The cells were lysed in the centrifuge tube in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protease inhibitor mixture described above) using a prechilled Polytron homogenizer. Next, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 31,000 rpm (110,000 × g) in a Beckman Ultracentrifuge Ti 55.2 for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The clarified lysate was pumped at 1 ml/min over a pre-equlibrated HiTrapp Q FF ion exchange column from Amersham Biosciences. After washing with lysis buffer containing 0.2 m KCl, Ime2p-myc was eluted in 15 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.4 m KCl. To further purify Ime2p-myc, the eluate was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 120 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-agarose beads and 250 μl of anti-Myc antibody (A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 200 μg/ml). The immunoprecipitated proteins were reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 and alkylated with 0.5 m iodoacetamide in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 prior to elution from the beads by boiling in a SDS-containing loading buffer and resolving on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Coomassie-stained Ime2p-myc bands were excised from the gel, washed, and destained in 50% methanol overnight, dehydrated in acetonitrile, and rehydrated in the reducing and alkylating agents described above. MS analysis was performed at the W. M. Keck Biomedical Mass Spectometry Laboratory at the University of Virginia. Gel slices were dehydrated a second time, dried by vacuum centrifugation, rehydrated, and digested overnight at 37 °C in 20 mg/ml trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3. Peptides were extracted twice using 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid, pooled and injected into a Finnigan LCQ DecaXP ion trap mass spectrometer system with a Protana nanospray ion source (operated at 2.8 kV) interfaced to a Phenomenex Jupiter 10-μm C18 reversed-phase capillary column. Peptides were eluted from the column by an acetonitrile/0.1 m acetic acid gradient at a flow rate of 0.25 μl/min. The digest was analyzed using acquired full mass spectra to determine the molecular weights of the peptides followed by 4 product ion spectra to determine amino acid sequence. The data were analyzed by Sequest search algorithm for matching peptides. The Ime2p Activation Loop and C-terminal Regulatory Domain Are Phosphorylated in Vivo—To gain insight into how phosphorylation regulates Ime2p, we developed a method to purify phosphorylated Ime2p from sporulating cells suitable for phosphosite identification using mass spectral (MS) analysis. Overexpression of IME2 is lethal to mitotically growing cells and may have negative effects on sporulation (10Bolte M. Steigemann P. Braus G.H. Irniger S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schindler, unpublished observations. Furthermore, we wanted to identify phosphorylation sites that are modified during wild-type sporulation conditions. We therefore chose to purify Ime2p using a strain in which Myc epitope coding information had been integrated at the chromosomal IME2 locus. Cells of the rapidly sporulating SK1 genetic background were collected at 7.5-h post-induction, when the meiotic divisions are occurring and Ime2p is most abundant and hyperphosphorylated (Refs. 4Benjamin K.R.

https://openalex.org/W1969692930,"The centrosome modulates spindle formation and plays a critical role in guiding proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Centrosome aberrations, frequently seen in human tumors, may cause abnormal chromosome segregation and contribute to malignant transformation. To explore the components of the centrosomes, we previously identified a novel centrosomal protein called Su48. To further characterize the Su48-containing protein ensemble in the centrosome, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens and isolated a number of Su48-interacting molecules, including the centrosomal protein Nde1. Here, we demonstrate that Su48 can associate with Nde1. Moreover, we found that Nde1 is subjected to phosphorylation in vivo. In particular, we identified six putative Cdc2 phosphorylation sites in Nde1 and found that alteration of these sites diminishes phosphorylation by Cdc2 in vitro and affects the stability of Su48-Nde1 interactions and the centrosomal localization of Nde1. Ablation of Nde1 by gene specific small interfering RNA causes mitotic delay and cell death, coupled with a modest decrease in the incidence of the cells that harbor excessive centrosomes. Collectively, our findings indicate that Nde1 can form a protein complex with Su48 in the centrosome and plays an important role for successful mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1998874139,"Daily oscillations in mRNA levels are a general feature of most clock genes. Although mRNA oscillations largely depend on transcriptional regulation, it has been suggested that post-transcriptional controls also contribute to mRNA oscillations in Drosophila. Currently, however, there is no direct evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of mammalian clock genes. To investigate the roles of post-transcriptional regulations, we focused on the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of mouse Period3 (mPer3) mRNA, one of the clock genes. Insertion of the entire mPer3 3′-UTR downstream of a reporter gene resulted in a dramatic decrease in mRNA stability. Deletion and point mutation analyses led to the identification of critical sequences responsible for mRNA decay. To explore the effects of the mPer3 3′-UTR-mediated mRNA decay on circadian oscillations, we established NIH3T3 stable cell lines that express luciferase mRNA with wild-type or mutant mPer3 3′-UTR. Interestingly, a stabilizing mutation of 3′-UTR induced a significant alteration in the oscillation profile of luciferase mRNA. Above all, the peak time, during which the mRNAs reached their highest levels, was significantly delayed (for 12 h). In addition, the luciferase mRNA level with mutant 3′-UTR began to increase earlier than that in the presence of wild-type 3′-UTR. Consequently, luciferase mRNA with mutant 3′-UTR displayed oscillation patterns with a prolonged rising phase. Our results indicate that mPer3 3′-UTR-mediated mRNA decay plays an essential role in mRNA cycling and provide direct evidence for post-transcriptional control of circadian mRNA oscillations.

Circadian rhythms, defined as daily behavioral and physiological oscillations, have been observed in a variety of organisms. These oscillations are driven by a self-sustained time-keeping system, the intracellular clock (1Bell-Pedersen D. Cassone V.M. Earnest D.J. Golden S.S. Hardin P.E. Thomas T.L. Zoran M.J. Nat. Rev.

In addition, it was revealed that the intracellular molecular clock consists of interacting positive and negative transcriptional and translational feedback loops that involve these components (9Reppert S.M.

In Drosophila, nevertheless, it has been suggested that post-transcriptional controls also contribute to mRNA oscillations. First, despite the absence of rhythmic transcription, period (per) mRNA showed circadian cycling in transgenic flies carrying promoter-less per gene (18Frisch B. Hardin P.E. Hamblen-Coyle M.J. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Second, results of a nuclear run-on assay suggested that post-transcriptional regulation is responsible for mRNA cycling (19So W.V. Rosbash M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7146-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).In mammals, however, much less is known about the relevance of post-transcriptional control to the circadian oscillations of clock gene mRNAs. By computational modeling, it was demonstrated that circadian clocks depend on mRNA stability (20Forger D.B. Peskin C.S. J. Theor. Biol. 2004; 230: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These authors proposed that the changes in mRNA stability accounted for the time lag between mRNA and protein levels. In the case of the mouse Period1 (mPer1) gene, it was reported that the 3′-UTR 2The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; mPer3, mouse Period3; SDM, site-directed mutagenesis; AANAT, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcription; TBP, TATA-binding protein; WT, wild-type. 2The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; mPer3, mouse Period3; SDM, site-directed mutagenesis; AANAT, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcription; TBP, TATA-binding protein; WT, wild-type. of mPer1 mRNA repressed its own expression and that this translational repression could be involved in the generation of the same time lag (i.e. the time lag between mRNA and protein levels) (21Kojima S. Hirose M. Tokunaga K. Sakaki Y. Tei H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Currently, however, there is no experimental evidence for the involvement of post-transcriptional regulation in the circadian mRNA cycling of clock genes.To investigate the role of post-transcriptional regulation in circadian mRNA cycling, we focused on the 3′-UTR of mouse Period3 (mPer3) mRNA, one of the mammalian clock genes that shows typical mRNA oscillations (22Zylka M.J.

To obtain direct evidence for the role of the 3′-UTR, we established NIH3T3 stable cell lines that each express luciferase mRNA with wild-type or mutant mPer3 3′-UTR. Previous studies have shown that circadian clocks exist even in cultured fibroblasts and that either dexamethasone or serum shock can synchronize the circadian expression of a variety of clock genes (24Balsalobre A.

Since then, this cell system has been used as an experimental model to examine the molecular mechanisms of the mammalian circadian clock (27Nagoshi E. Saini C. Bauer C. Laroche T. Naef F. Schibler U.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the mPer3 3′-UTR regulates mRNA stability and that 3′-UTR-mediated mRNA decay plays an important role in circadian mRNA cycling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES3′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (3′-RACE)—3′-RACE was performed with mouse suprachiasmatic nuclei cDNAs as templates. The sequences of the mPer3 specific forward primers were as follows: F1, 5′-TCATGGAGATGTGTGTGCCCCGG-3′ and F2, 5′-CGGAATTCCTTGAAGAGGGGTAAGAGTTTGG-3′. The sequences of the reverse (dT)17-adaptor primer was 5′-GCTCTAGAGGCCTCGAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′. The nested PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and the fragment was ligated into EcoRI/XbaI sites of pBluescript SK(+) vector (Stratagene). Nucleotide sequences were determined by sequencing using ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer System.Plasmids—The pcNAT control vector was constructed using the pcDNA3.1/His C vector (Invitrogen). Hence, the arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) coding region is followed by bovine growth hormone poly(A) signal without any specific 3′-UTR (30Kim T.D. Kim J.S. Kim J.H. Myung J. Chae H.D.

For the pcNAT/1–2220 construct, full-length 3′-UTR of mPer3 mRNA was amplified with forward primer (5′-CGGAATTCGCAGCTGTAAAGATGTCACACCCC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GCTCTAGATTCCACTTGAACACATATACTGTTT-3′), digested with EcoRI/XbaI, and cloned into EcoRI/XbaI sites of pcNAT control vector.To generate the deletion constructs, various regions of mPer3 3′-UTR were amplified using pcNAT/1–2220 as a template. The amplified fragments are shown in Fig. 2A. All of the PCR fragments are flanked by an EcoRI site at one end and an XbaI site at the other end. Following EcoRI/XbaI digestion, fragments were introduced into the corresponding restriction sites of pcNAT control vector. For the constructs of point mutations as shown in Fig. 3B, two-step PCR amplification was performed with following primers: for SDM-A former fragment (5′-CGGAATTCGCAGCTGTAAAGATGTCACACCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AACATAAAAGGGGGAACGAGACGAAGGCCTGCGAC-3′ (reverse)), for SDM-A latter fragment (5′-CGTCTCGTTCCCCCTTTTATGTTGTTACAAGATCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTCTAGATTCCACTTGAACACATATACTGTTT-3′ (reverse)), for SDM-B former fragment (5′-CGGAATTCGCAGCTGTAAAGATGTCACACCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-A-CAACATGGGGGGGCAAACGAGACGAAGGCCTGC-3′ (reverse)), for SDM-B latter fragment (5′-CGTTTGCCCCCCCATGTTGTTACAAGATCACTTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTCTAGATTCCACTTGAACACATATACTGTTT-3′ (reverse)). The second PCR fragment was digested and cloned into EcoRI/XbaI sites of pcNAT control vector.FIGURE 3Deletion and mutational analysis of a critical cis-acting element. A, HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with various deletion constructs. After incubation for 17 h, cells were harvested (Act.D 0 h) or further incubated with 5 μg of actinomycin D/ml for 6 h before harvest (Act.D 6 h). Reporter mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis (Northern). For the detection of reporter mRNAs and loading controls, both AANAT (NAT)- and ribosomal protein L32 (RPL32)-coding regions were used as probes, respectively. Signal intensities were quantified using a PhosphorImager, normalized to RPL32 signal intensity, and indicated as relative values. For each transfection condition, the NAT/RPL32 ratio at time 0 was set to 1.00. B and C, the mRNA decay kinetics of wild-type and mutant reporters are shown. CHO-K1 cells were transiently co-transfected with the pcNAT control vector and pcNAT/1–2220, pcNAT/1–2220(SDM-A), or pcNAT/1–2220(SDM-B) reporter plasmids. Mutated nucleotides of pcNAT/1–2220(SDM-A) and pcNAT/1–2220(SDM-B) reporters are depicted in bold and underlined. Reporter mRNA decay rates were determined by actinomycin D (Act.D) chase experiments and Northern blot analyses using the AANAT-coding region as a probe. Northern blot data are representative of two experiments. Signal intensities were quantified using a PhosphorImager, normalized to NAT control mRNA signal intensity, and plotted as a percentage of the initial value versus time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To generate D-box-Luc/WT-3′-UTR/Neo vector, pGL3 control vector (Promega) was digested with XbaI and filled up with T4 DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science).

The neomycin-resistant gene preceded by the thymidine kinase promoter was amplified from pMC1neo poly(A) vector (Stratagene) with forward primer (5′-GCTCTAGAGCAGTGTGGTTTTGCAAGAGGAA-3′) and reverse pri-mer (5′-CAGGTCGACGGATCCGAACAAACG-3′). Following XbaI/SalI digestion, the fragment was cloned into XbaI/SalI sites of D-box-Luc/3′-UTR vector. For D-box-Luc/SDM-3′-UTR/Neo vector, mutant 3′-UTR (SDM-A) was used instead of wild-type mPer3 3′-UTR.FIGURE 4The mPer3 3′-UTR plays an essential role in circadian mRNA oscillations. A, temporal expression profiles of endogenous mPer3 mRNA are shown from NIH3T3 fibroblasts after dexamethasone (Dex) shock. When dexamethasone (Dex) was treated, the time was set to zero. The mPer3 mRNA level was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and normalized to TBP mRNA levels. Initial levels of mPer3 mRNA were arbitrarily set to 1.0. Each point presented is a mean ± S.E. of three experiments. B, schematic diagram of reporter genes expressed in NIH-Luc-WT 3′-UTR or NIH-Luc-SDM 3′-UTR cell lines is shown. The D-box-containing region of the mPer3 promoter was fused to the SV40 basic promoter (SV40). D-box sequences are underlined.

Kim J.S. Kim J.H. Myung J. Chae H.D. Woo K.C. Jang S.K. Koh D.S. Kim K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3232-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) at room temperature. After incubation for 5 h, cells were harvested or further incubated for indicated time with 5 μg of actinomycin D/ml before harvest.Generation of Stable Cell Lines and Dexamethasone Shock Procedure—To generate NIH-Luc-WT 3′-UTR and NIH-Luc-SDM 3′-UTR cell lines, D-box-Luc/WT-3′-UTR/Neo vector, and D-box-Luc/SDM-3′-UTR/Neo vector were introduced to NIH3T3 fibroblasts by calcium phosphate precipitation method, respectively. After 2 days, we started selection with 800 μg of G418 (Invitrogen)/ml. Neomycin-resistant clones were isolated by standard procedure. The resulting cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 200 μg of G418/ml.The dexamethasone shock was done as described previously, with minor modifications (24Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in each well of 12-well plate. When the cells reached confluence, the medium was exchanged with 100 nm dexamethasone containing medium. After 2 h, this medium was replaced with complete medium. At the indicated time, cells were harvested and kept at –70 °C until total RNA was extracted from the cells.Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (30Kim T.D. Kim J.S. Kim J.H. Myung J. Chae H.D. Woo K.C. Jang S.K. Koh D.S. Kim K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3232-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was isolated by using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five micrograms of total RNA was size-separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis containing 0.66 m formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membranes (ICN), and hybridized with a randomly primed probe. For detection of reporter mRNA and loading control, rat AANAT (GeneBank™ accession number NM_012818) and ribosomal protein L32 (GeneBank™ accession number NM_000994) coding regions were used as probes, respectively. Radioactivity was measured by autoradiography.Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed as described previously (31Lee J.H. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was isolated by using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center). RNA was reverse transcribed by using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For detection and quantification, MyiQ™ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) was used. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers were as follows: endogenous mPer3, 5′-TTGTCAGGTTGGCCTTCTCT-3′ and 5′-GGCATCCTAGCAGAGGTGAG-3′; luciferase, 5′-GAGGTTCCATCTGCCAGGTA-3′ and 5′-CACACAGTTCGCCTCTTTGA-3′; TATA-binding protein (TBP), 5′-CAGCCTTCCACCTTATGCTC-3′ and 5′-TTGCTGCTGCTGTCTTTGTT-3′.RESULTSThe mPer3 3′-UTR Regulates mRNA Stability—We cloned the 3′-UTR of mPer3 mRNA by 3′-RACE. Sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA showed that the mPer3 3′-UTR was composed of 2,220 nucleotides, contained a peculiar, U-rich region in the middle of the 3′-UTR, and included three putative poly(A) signals (Fig. 1). When the mPer3 3′-UTR sequence was aligned in the corresponding loci of the genome, the sequence agreed with the mouse genome sequence (data not shown). The mPer3 3′-UTR sequence was deposited in GeneBank™ with accession number DQ196346.FIGURE 1RNA sequence of mouse Period 3 3′-UTR. The first three nucleotides (boxed) represent the translation stop codon. Putative poly(A) additional signals are underlined. The boundaries of the deletion constructs, shown in Fig. 2A, are indicated by solid triangles. The asterisks represent the mutation sites of each of the mutant constructs, shown in Fig. 3B. Numbering begins at the first nucleotide, following the stop codon. The mPer3 3′-UTR sequence was deposited in GeneBank™ with accession number DQ196346.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the function of the mPer3 3′-UTR, a reporter construct (pcNAT/1–2220) was created by inserting the mPer3 3′-UTR downstream from the AANAT-coding sequence of the pcNAT control vector (30Kim T.D. Kim J.S. Kim J.H. Myung J. Chae H.D. Woo K.C. Jang S.K. Koh D.S. Kim K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3232-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with the pcNAT/1–2220 reporter or the pcNAT control vector and treated with actinomycin D for the indicated times to block new transcription. The effects of the mPer3 3′-UTR were determined by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, the reporter mRNA with the mPer3 3′-UTR insertion (right panel) was rapidly degraded, whereas control mRNA lacking the mPer3 3′-UTR insertion (left panel) was sufficiently stable to maintain consistent mRNA levels, even after 6 h of actinomycin D treatment. This result suggests that the mPer3 3′-UTR mediates mRNA degradation.Deletion and Mutational Analyses of a Critical cis-Acting Element—To identify the region critical for mRNA degradation, various reporter constructs containing serially deleted fragments of the mPer3 3′-UTR were generated (Fig. 2A). The effects of these 3′-UTR fragments were analyzed by Northern blot analysis. Compared with the full-length 3′-UTR (pcNAT/1–2220), truncation of the distal region of the 3′-UTR to nucleotides 1164, 741, or 561 had no significant effect on mRNA stability (Fig. 3A, see pcNAT/1–1164, pcNAT/1–741, and pcNAT/1–561, respectively). Interestingly, the additional removal of nucleotides 382–561 caused a dramatic increase in mRNA stability (see pcNAT/1–381). Greater than 80% of the initial mRNA amount was present even after 6 h of actinomycin D treatment. To address whether the fragment 382–561 itself shows mRNA decay activity, we generated pcNAT/382–561 reporter construct and analyzed the effect on mRNA stability (Fig. 3A, right panel). Although the effect was weaker than that of full-length 3′-UTR (1–2220), the fragment 382–561 still showed mRNA decay activity. That is, more than 40% of the initial mRNA was degraded after 6 h of actinomycin D treatment.We then sought to identify critical sequences within nucleotides 382–561. Since most of the protein bindings against mPer3 3′-UTR were competed out by homopolymeric poly(U) nucleotides (data not shown), we decided to mutate U-rich sequences between nucleotides 382 and 561. We generated two mutant reporter constructs, pcNAT/1–2220(SDM-A) and pcNAT/1–2220(SDM-B), in which four and six nucleotides of the mPer3 3′-UTR were substituted with cytidines, respectively (Fig. 3B).To investigate the effects of these mutations, we examined the kinetics of reporter mRNA degradation by actinomycin D chase experiment and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3, B and C). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2B, wild-type reporter mRNA was rapidly degraded (t½ of ∼3 h). However, SDM-A mutant mRNA was significantly stable (t½ > 8 h), maintaining 58% of its initial levels even after 8 h of actinomycin D treatment. These results demonstrate that the mutated sequences in the SDM-A reporter comprise a cis-acting element important for mRNA decay. Interestingly, despite the existence of overlapping mutation sites, SDM-B mutant mRNA showed completely different degradation kinetics from that of SDM-A mutant mRNA. The SDM-B mutant mRNA was rapidly degraded (t½ of ∼3.5 h) with a decay rate similar to that of wild-type reporter mRNA.mPer3 3′-UTR-mediated mRNA Decay Contributes to Circadian mRNA Oscillations—Before analyzing the effects of the mPer3 3′-UTR on circadian mRNA oscillations, we first examined the circadian oscillation profile of endogenous mPer3 mRNA in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. After dexamethasone shock, mPer3 mRNA showed robust circadian rhythms (Fig. 4A). The mRNA levels rapidly decreased immediately after dexamethasone shock and began to increase after 18 h. After reaching their peak level at 30 h, mRNA levels began to decline again.To explore the roles of mPer3 3′-UTR-mediated mRNA decay in circadian oscillations, we established NIH3T3 stable cell lines that express luciferase mRNA with wild-type or SDM-A mutant mPer3 3′-UTR and designated them NIH-Luc-WT 3′-UTR or NIH-Luc-SDM 3′-UTR cell lines, respectively (Fig. 4B). The expression of the luciferase reporters was regulated by D-box elements of the mPer3 promoter, which were previously verified to be sufficient for the generation of circadian oscillations (10Ueda H.R. Hayashi S. Chen W. Sano M. Machida M. Shigeyoshi Y. Iino M. Hashimoto S. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar).As shown in Fig. 4C, luciferase mRNAs with wild-type mPer3 3′-UTR showed similar oscillation profiles to endogenous mPer3 mRNA. The levels of luciferase mRNA began to increase after 18 h of dexamethasone shock. After reaching their peak levels at 30 h, mRNA levels started to decline. We confirmed these oscillation profiles in two different NIH-Luc-WT 3′-UTR cell lines (i.e. #1 and #9). Interestingly, the SDM-A mutation of the mPer3 3′-UTR led to dramatic alterations in these oscillation patterns (Fig. 4D, #3 and #4). Above all, the peak time, during which the mRNAs reached their highest levels, was significantly delayed (for 12 h). In addition, the mRNA levels began to increase earlier than that with wild-type 3′-UTR, and the rising phase continued until 42 h. Consequently, luciferase mRNAs with mutant 3′-UTR showed oscillation patterns with a prolonged rising phase. Based on these results, we concluded that the mPer3 3′-UTR-mediated mRNA decay plays an essential role in mRNA cycling.DISCUSSIONMost clock genes show circadian oscillations in protein and/or mRNA levels (1Bell-Pedersen D.

https://openalex.org/W2040813829,"The S-phase DNA damage checkpoint is activated by DNA damage to delay DNA synthesis allowing time to resolve the replication block. We previously discovered the p53-dependent S-phase DNA damage checkpoint in mouse zygotes fertilized with irradiated sperm. Here, we report that the same p53 dependency holds in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) at low doses of irradiation. DNA synthesis in p53 wild-type (WT) MEFs was suppressed in a biphasic manner in which a sharp decrease below 2.5 Gy was followed by a more moderate decrease up to 10 Gy. In contrast, p53−/− MEFs exhibited radioresistant DNA synthesis below 2.5 Gy whereas the cells retained the moderate suppression above 5 Gy. DNA fiber analysis revealed that 1 Gy irradiation suppressed replication fork progression in p53 WT MEFs, but not in p53−/− MEFs. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), clamp loader of DNA polymerase, was phosphorylated in WT MEFs after 1 Gy irradiation and redistributed to form foci in the nuclei. In contrast, PCNA was not phosphorylated and dissociated from chromatin in 1 Gy-irradiated p53−/− MEFs. These results demonstrate that the novel low-dose-specific p53-dependent S-phase DNA damage checkpoint is likely to regulate the replication fork movement through phosphorylation of PCNA."
https://openalex.org/W2091199510,"The IG20 gene is overexpressed in human tumors and cancer cell lines, and encodes at least four splice variants (SVs) namely, IG20pa, MADD, IG20-SV2 and DENN-SV. Earlier, gain-of-function studies showed that IG20-SVs can exhibit diverse functions and play a critical role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Expression of exogenous IG20pa or DENN-SV rendered cells either susceptible or resistant to induced apoptosis, respectively, whereas MADD and IG20-SV2 had no apparent effect. In order to understand the contrasting effects of the IG20-SVs in a physiologically more relevant system, we expressed exon-specific small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to selectively knockdown specific IG20-SVs. Consistent with an earlier study, knockdown of all IG20-SVs resulted in spontaneous apoptosis of HeLa and PA-1 cells. In addition, we unambiguously demonstrated that knockdown of MADD can render cells susceptible to spontaneous apoptosis but had no discernible effect on cell proliferation, colony size or cell cycle progression. Moreover, expression of MADD alone, and not DENN-SV, in the absence of endogenous IG20-SVs was sufficient to prevent spontaneous apoptosis. Our results show the utility of shRNAs for selective knockdown of particular IG20-SVs and their potential therapeutic value in cancer. Further, they demonstrate that MADD alone is sufficient and necessary for cancer cell survival."

An important contribution to head-head coordination arises from the action of the neck-linker that docks onto the core motor domain upon ATP binding. We show here that the docked neck-linker not only guides the microtubule-unbound head to the next microtubule binding site but also signals its position to the head to which it is attached. Cross-linking studies on mutated kinesin constructs reveal that residues at the interface motor core/docked neck-linker, among them most importantly a conserved tyrosine, are involved in this feedback. The primary effect of the docked neck-linker is a reduced microtubule binding affinity in the ADP state. Kinesin-1 motor proteins step along microtubules by a mechanism in which the heads cycle through microtubule-bound and unbound states in an interlaced fashion.

The primary effect of the docked neck-linker is a reduced microtubule binding affinity in the ADP state. Kinesin-1 (formerly conventional kinesin) proteins are molecular motors that move along microtubules in a stepwise fashion at the expense of ATP hydrolysis energy. A large body of evidence shows that these motors are dimeric and generate motility by the alternating action of two identical motor domains (1Hackney D.D.

A crucial structural intermediate is a Kinesin-1 molecule that is strongly attached to the filament by one nucleotide-free head, whereas the other one remains in a weakly microtubule-binding ADP state. Upon ATP binding, a very rapid structural change of the neck-linker of the microtubule-bound motor head occurs that allows the partner head to lose its ADP and to bind tightly to the microtubule (7Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. Cheung H.C. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36731-36739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The neck-linker, a short stretch of ∼10 amino acid residues that follows immediately C-terminal of the catalytic core motor domain, is thought to exist in at least two different conformations, one that is docked or zippered to the motor core, and a flexible undocked structure (8Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D.

Cooke R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 844-848PubMed Google Scholar), and its path along microtubule-bound kinesin has been deduced from cryo-EM (8Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1518-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). According to these data, the neck-linker zippers along a groove in the core motor domain between helix 6 on one end, and loop 10 on the other end where it is held by a meshwork of hydrogen bonds. The nature of the undocked conformation is not clear and might differ in truncated, monomeric constructs (that have been used for many of the structural investigations) and dimeric ones. The conformational change of the neck-linker has been used to explain the mechanism of Kinesin-1 motility. It is thought that necklinker docking allows or causes the second head to bind to a forward microtubule binding site. Interestingly, it is unlikely that the docking process of the neck-linker generates the force exerted by kinesin. The free energy of neck-linker docking is surprisingly low (ΔG ∼-1 kJ/mol; Ref. 9Rice S. Cui Y. Sindelar C. Naber N. Matuska M. Vale R. Cooke R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1844-1854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and hardly accounts for the force that can be generated by a single kinesin molecule (5-6 pN, Ref. 13Visscher K. Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Estimated from crystal structures, the length of the neck-linker is at least 4 nm. Accordingly, ΔG will be ≥ 12 kJ/mol, which is roughly 10-fold larger than the measured free enthalpy change of neck-linker docking. Finally, the neck-linker has been shown to play other roles than providing energy or directionality for motility. Most simplistic, it provides the spatial freedom to bridge the 8-nm gap between adjacent microtubule binding sites. Motility assays with neck-linker mutants that were arrested in the docked state by disulfide bonds failed to step, supporting the structural importance of the neck-linker region (14Tomishige M. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the reality is more complex because from the crystal structure and the known geometry of the kinesin-microtubule complex a strain is predicted to arise between the two heads when they are in the intermediate state where both heads bind simultaneously. This strain has been suspected to change the kinetic properties of the motor domains and facilitates dissociation of the rear head, and/or slows down the ATP binding of the leading head (15Carter N.J. Cross R.A. Nature. 2005; 435: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 16Rosenfeld S.S. Fordyce P.M. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. Block S.M. J. Biol.

The models assume that the leading, nucleotide-free head of the conventional kinesin motor possesses a flexible neck-linker that exerts a strain on its rear partner. The forward strain on the trailing head has been proposed to accelerate dissociation from the microtubule by a factor of ∼2 (15Carter N.J. Cross R.A. Nature. 2005; 435: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 16Rosenfeld S.S. Fordyce P.M. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. Block S.M. J. Biol.

In addition, the rearward strain on the leading head seems to inhibit ATP binding, which keeps the head in a strong microtubule binding state and prevents premature release (16Rosenfeld S.S. Fordyce P.M. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. Block S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18550-18556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). According to these models, the neck-linker thus plays a central role in the generation of motility by signaling the binding state of the leading head to the lagging one. The present study tests whether neck-linker immobilization merely prevents motility by restricting the diffusional freedom of the leading head, or whether there are other, less direct kinetic effects that might be related to strain transmission. Our results on cross-linked neck-linker mutants show that the latter is the case because kinesin monomers (that function without any communication between motor heads) show dramatic defects when their neck-linker is kept in the docked state. We investigate the structural requirements for this feedback in mutants with an altered interface between neck-linker/motor core. Our results indicate that the kinesin motor core contains important sensor residues for the position of the neck-linker that directly affect the microtubule affinity, and thus also the kinetics of the core motor domain. Protein Expression and Purification—Kinesin was expressed and purified as described (19Kallipolitou A. Deluca D. Majdic U. Lakamper S. Cross R. Meyhofer E. Moroder L. Schliwa M. Woehlke G.

Briefly, Neurospora crassa kinesin (NcKin) 2The abbreviations used are: NcKin, N. crassa kinesin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid; ANOVA, analysis of variance; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. was bacterially expressed using a T7 promoter system, isolated from Escherichia coli cells and purified on a HiTrap SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and 5 mm MgCl2. The protein was eluted with increasing NaCl concentrations. Human kinesin mutants were purified according to published procedures (14Tomishige M. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). DTT was present during the cell rupture but omitted during the ion exchange chromatography. Tubulin was prepared and polymerized as described (21Mandelkow E.-M. Herrmann M. Rühl U. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Huang T.G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NcKin Protein Backgrounds—As protein background cysteine-light NcKin constructs were used that did not contain maleimide-reactive cysteine residues, as confirmed by dye labeling experiments. Two variants of cysteine-light backgrounds were used: one retaining two native cysteine residues (Cys38 and Cys59; mutation: C307A), one lacking all endogenous cysteine residues (C38V/C59T/C307A; Cys-free). Furthermore, truncated NcKin backgrounds of different lengths were used. The C-terminal deletion construct NcKin-343 (NcKin residues 1-343; Ref. 19Kallipolitou A. Deluca D. Majdic U. Lakamper S. Cross R. Meyhofer E. Moroder L. Schliwa M. Woehlke G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6226-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used to study the behavior of monomeric constructs, NcKin-436hKT (NcKin residues 1-436 and human kinesin residues 432-546; Ref. 23Bathe F.

In this chimera, part of the human kinesin stalk was appended to be able to bind NcKin mutants to glass coverslips. The addition of the human tail portion only affects the behavior of the motor in few, very specific mutant contexts (23Bathe F. Hahlen K. Dombi R. Driller L. Schliwa M. Woehlke G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3529-3537Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a control, the AE mutant comprising residues 1-436 of NcKin was tested and did not show a significant kinetic difference in the microtubule-dependent ATPase assay between variants lacking or containing the partial human stalk. Therefore, all other mutants were only tested in the chimeric background containing the human stalk. Introduction of Disulfide Bridges—To introduce cross-links between the kinesin motor core and neck-linker, pairs of amino acid residues were selected that, according to known crystal structures, are in close proximity to each other to allow the formation of disulfide bonds (Fig. 1; Refs. 10Sack S. Muller J. Marx A. Thormahlen M. Mandelkow E.M. Brady S.T. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36 (ISSN:10006-12960): 16155-16165Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar and 24Song Y.H. Marx A.

The selected wild-type residues were changed to cysteines in Kinesin-1 of N. crassa (NcKin) using a PCR-based mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene QuickChange) on a bacterial expression vector (19Kallipolitou A.

In the N. crassa kinesin sequence, the introduced cysteine residues were located at positions Ser3 and Ala334 (SA mutant), Arg300 and Ala334 (RA mutant), or Ala226 and Glu339 (AE mutant), respectively. In a sequence alignment, Ser3/Ala334 and Ala226/Glu339 correspond to the locations that have been investigated previously in human kinesin (14Tomishige M. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The monomeric human kinesin mutant hKin-339his-K222C/E334C was generated by PCR on the human clone hKin560-GFP-K222C/E334C (14Tomishige M. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Quantification of the Extent of Cross-linking—To test how many cysteine residues are accessible to the oxidant DTNB (5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), or Ellman's reagent), a colorimetric assay was performed. The reaction of DTNB with a thiol group releases a thionitrobenzoic acid molecule that absorbs with ϵ412 = 13,600 m-1 cm-1 (25Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research, 3rd Ed. 1986; (Oxford)Google Scholar). The assay was performed in 50 mm (final concentration) Tris-HCl, pH 8, and in a Uvicon UV930 dual beam spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments) with a blank sample in the reference beam. A standard curve with a freshly prepared l-cysteine solution confirmed that the reaction conditions led to the published extinction coefficient and was linear down to a final concentration of ∼1 μm thiol groups. Protein was used as highly concentrated as possible and in two different amounts to test the linearity of the assay. The concentration of the kinesin batches used was determined with a Bradford protein quantification assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad) and converted into molar concentrations using the calculated molecular mass. The ratio of thiols detected in the DTNB assay and the molar protein concentration gave the number of thiols per kinesin molecule. The protein concentration was measured as an average of multiple amounts of protein in the assay, and the S.E. of this measurement was used to estimate a reliable interval of measured thiols per protein. Because the DTNB-oxidized protein preparations could not be measured directly in the thiol quantification assay, an additional SP-Sepharose chromatography step was used to remove excess TNB. Kinesin-containing elution fractions were pooled, quantified by a Bradford assay, and subject to the DTNB thiol assay. For mass spectrometry, the protein was carbamidomethylated. To this end, the protein was incubated with 50 mm iodoacetamide, which turned out to lead to the best yield of modified protein in a reasonable time, and an acceptable degree of side products. The reaction was stopped with 100 mm DTT, and the sample was purified over a C18 column (OMIX Tips C18MB, Varian) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mass spectrometry was performed as described (26Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Gliding and Kinetic Assays—Standard motility assays were performed by applying 1.25 μg of kinesin (NcKin-436hKT) to a coverslip that was kept for 1-2 min in a wet chamber to allow the human kinesin stalk to bind to the glass surface. Casein buffer was added to a final volume of 5 μl. Then 1 μl of BRB80 (80 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) with 100 mm KCl, 1 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of 100 mm ATP, and 1 μl of 1 mm microtubules were added. The coverslip was put onto a glass slide and sealed. Motility was monitored in a Zeiss Axiophot using video-enhanced phase-contrast microscopy. Some constructs were also monitored in a TIRF microscope (Olympus), where tetramethylrhodamine- or Atto488-labeled microtubules were tracked. This assay allowed much higher microtubule concentrations, facilitating characterization of mutants with low microtubule affinities. Motor densities were not strictly controlled in these assays. Fluorescence was excited using linearly polarized 532 nm or 488 nm laser light, a ×100 Zeiss objective and an Electron Multiplier CCD Camera (Hamamatsu C9100-02). The ATPase activity was routinely measured in dependence on the microtubule concentration. The steady state ATP turnover was characterized in a coupled enzymatic assay in 12A25 buffer (12 mm Aces·KOH, pH 6.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25 mm potassium acetate; Refs. 19Kallipolitou A. Deluca D. Majdic U. Lakamper S. Cross R. Meyhofer E. Moroder L. Schliwa M. Woehlke G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6226-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and 27Huang T. Suhan J. Hackney D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of saturating ATP concentrations (2 mm ATP), and titrated with variable amounts of microtubules until a reliable Michaelis-Menten curve was established (typically, R >> 0.95). The maximal turnover number, kcat, and the half-maximal activation constant, K0.5,Mt, as well as their experimental errors, were deduced from a hyperbolic curve fit using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The Michaelis-Menten constants for ATP, Km,ATP, were measured at saturating microtubule concentrations (5 or 9 μm for dimeric constructs, which is more than 10-fold higher than K0.5,Mt, and 10 or 12 μm for monomers, which was ∼3-fold higher than the K0.5,Mt; higher microtubule concentrations were impractical to use). The basal ATP turnover was assayed in 12A25 by quantification of radioactive inorganic phosphate released from hydrolyzed [γ-32P]ATP over time (19Kallipolitou A. Deluca D. Majdic U. Lakamper S. Cross R. Meyhofer E. Moroder L. Schliwa M. Woehlke G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6226-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Phosphate was separated from nucleotide and protein using charcoal (28Shimizu T. Thorn K.S. Ruby A. Vale R.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5265-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The linear parts of these curves were used to calculate the basal ATP turnover if they contained at least 4 data points in the linear part, and if the double amount of kinesin in the assay led to a curve slope double as steep. The microtubule-induced mant-ADP release was measured by mixing mant-ADP charged kinesin and microtubules in the presence of unlabeled ATP, either manually in a spectrophotometer (Aminco-Bowman AB2) or in a stopped-flow instrument (Biologics SF-3) under conditions published before (29Schafer F. Deluca D. Majdic U. Kirchner J. Schliwa M. Moroder L. Woehlke G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The microtubule affinity of kinesin was determined using a fixed amount of kinesin (300-500 nm), and increasing amounts of microtubules (0-(10 to 50) μm, depending on the mutant and condition used (30Woehlke G. Ruby A.K. Hart C.L. Ly B. Hom-Booher N. Vale R.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar)). The tubulin dimer concentration was used to analyze the assays. Kinesin and microtubules were mixed in 12A25 buffer, and the microtubule-bound kinesin fraction was separated from free kinesin by 15 min of centrifugation at 120,000 × g in a Beckman Optima ultracentrifuge. After centrifugation the supernatant was removed, the pellet was resuspended in the original volume, and both samples were analyzed on a SDS gel. The Coomassie-stained gel was photographed with a CCD camera (Stratagene EagleEye) and analyzed densitometrically in the computer program ImageJ, applying uncalibrated OD settings. For unknown reasons, the supernatant contained variable amounts of tubulin, ranging from estimated 1-10%. If this was unpolymerized tubulin, the actual microtubule concentration would be overestimated ≤ 10%; if it contained small microtubule fragments that kinesin can still bind to the bound fraction would be underestimated by ≤ 10%. Statistical Analysis of Experimental Results—To decide whether an observed effect was significant, tables of gliding velocity and ATPase behavior of each single protein assay and preparation were considered (supplemental table; analysis software: GraphPad Prism 4.0, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). In cases where the number of independent protein preparations was 3 or more, a paired Student's t test could be used to test the null hypothesis that (otherwise identical) DTT- and DTNB-treated protein samples behaved identically. For this study, 32 independent dimer protein preparations were analyzed in gliding and ATPase assays. 29 monomer preparations were characterized in ATPase assays. Thus, the sample size was large enough to use variances for statistical analysis (one-way analysis of variance, ANOVA; Ref. 31Motulsky H. Intuitive Biostatistics. 1995; (Oxford University Press, New York, Oxford)Google Scholar). Data obtained on DTT-treated proteins served as a reference to check whether any diverging mutant DTNB value was significantly different. The consistency of data obtained on different constructs under DTT (reference) conditions was tested the same way, and each mutant was compared with all others in a one-way ANOVA. Mutant Design and Proof of Expected Disulfide Bonds—The Kinesin-1 neck-linker plays an important mechanical role in the generation of movement, and a permanently docked neck-linker prevents microtubule motility (14Tomishige M. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the Tomishige/Vale study, the neck-linker was kept in a docked state by inducing disulfide bonds between neck-linker and motor core. It was suggested that the cross-linked neck-linker of the microtubule-bound head restricts the mobility of the second, unbound kinesin head in a way that does not allow stepping. Although often assumed, it is unknown, however, whether there are other kinetic effects of neck-linker immobilization. We therefore looked for possible kinetic effects of neck-linker docking, and generated cysteine-light NcKin kinesin constructs in which we introduced pairs of cross-linkable cysteine residues at the interface between neck-linker and motor core (Fig. 1), and tested the activity in multiple motor gliding assays and steady state ATPase assays. Because the fungal Kinesin-1 NcKin is much faster than conventional kinesins from animals in gliding and enzymatic assays, the effects are clearer in this background. To immobilize the neck-linker, three different positions were chosen (S3C-A334C, N. crassa NcKin numbering; brief: SA-cross-link, R300CA334C, RA-cross-link, A226C-E339C, AE-cross-link). Judged from the distances in crystal structures (Protein Data Bank numbers: 1GOJ, 2KIN, 1MJK), these are the only pairs of residues that can form disulfide bonds without major structural distortions. To exclude artifacts of nonspecific cross-linking, all three endogenous NcKin cysteine residues were exchanged. In the first attempt the cysteine residues were mutated to serine or alanine. It turned out, however, that proteins containing C38S and C59S were not expressed by E. coli, whereas the C307A exchange did not affect expression and kinetic behavior. For most parts of the study we therefore used a background that still contained Cys38 and Cys59, but lacked Cys307 (NcKinC307A). To test whether the intended disulfides actually formed, we applied the following strategy: We first visualized the cross-link on a non-reducing SDS gel (Fig. 2), then used DTNB-based thiol quantification to show that all expected cysteines are present in untreated proteins, then showed that two cysteines of the SA and AE mutant become inaccessible to DTNB after oxidation, and finally identified the residues that were only accessible under reducing conditions by mass spectrometry. Oxidized NcKin AE and SA mutants, but not the wild-type, showed an increased mobility in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). However, the oxidized samples still contained a variable portion with mobility comparable to wild-type or reduced proteins. We therefore determined the thiol content in a colorimetric assay. Table 1 shows that in most constructs all cysteine residues are accessible to DTNB. The dimeric AE mutant is an exception, and shows considerable differences between both tested preparations, indicating partial oxidation of the protein. To test whether DTNB treatment led to proteins with two inaccessible cysteines, control preparations of dimeric AE and SA mutant were made and assayed immediately after the purification, as well as after DTNB treatment and subsequent removal of DTNB by a second chromatography step. To compensate the loss of material during this procedure and to be able to detect even low thiol concentrations, complete preparations dedicated to this test were used. The assay showed that the oxidized AE mutant contained 1.87 (1.82-1.92, considering S.E. from Bradford and DTNB measurements) thiol groups less than untreated, the SA mutant contained 2.40 (2.37-2.43) SH groups less. These values are close to the expected lack of 2 thiol groups that form a cystine in the oxidized samples.TABLE 1Thiol quantification Quantification of thiol groups by DTNB. Two independent, untreated preparations of each kinesin mutant were incubated with DTNB to determine the amount of thiol groups by the extinction e412 of the TNB reaction product (for details of the protocol, see “Experimental Procedures”). The calculated thiol concentration was compared to the protein concentration to give the number of SH groups per protein. As the largest error arises from the accuracy of the protein concentration, an interval was derived from the S.E. of the protein concentration assay (column 4).ConstructCysteine residuesMeasured SH/proteinConfidence intervalCommentMonomeric NK343Cfree AE21.701.61–1.78 NK343C307A AE43.623.28–3.90 NK343C307A SA44.153.85–4.58 NK343Cfree wt00.080.06–0.10TNB extinction close to the detection limitDimeric NKhTailCfree AE20.850.27–1.50Preparation 1: 1.30 SH/protein preparation 2: 0.28 SH/protein NKhTailC307A SA43.983.53–4.46 NKhTailCfree RA21.511.20–1.87 NKhTailCfree wt00.140.12–0.15 NKhTailC307A E339C32.872.55–3.21 NKhTailC307A A226C33.353.22–3.47 Open table in a new tab ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry confirmed these observations (supplemental Fig. S1). The untreated NK343C307A-AE protein had the predicted total mass of 37219.8 Da and was detected at the expected size. Under oxidizing conditions, it could be carbamidomethylated at two positions, leading to an increase in mass of 114.0 Da. Under reducing conditions, 4 residues were modified. MALDI-LIFT-MS/MS showed that the endogenous residues Cys38 and Cys59 are modified under oxidizing conditions only, implying that the introduced residues form the expected disulfide bond. We later managed to express a cysteine-free mutant that contained three mutations, C38V, C59T, and C307A. Thus, unintended cross-links of introduced cysteine residues with remaining endogenous residues were excluded. Although an unpaired Student's t test showed that monomeric cysteine-free mutants were significantly slower in the ATPase assay, the relative response to DTNB treatment of the cysteine-free AE mutant was indistinguishable from that of its C307A sister construct (supplemental table). Functional Analysis of Cross-linked Proteins—For functional assays, the proteins were routinely treated with 1 mm DTT to break possible disulfide bonds (reduced state), 0.2 mm DTNB to induce their formation (oxidized), or re-reduced with 5 mm DTT after DTNB oxidation (rescued). A test series confirmed that the oxidative effect of DTNB was completed after 5 min, whereas some constructs were only re-activated to a reasonable degree after 4 h. The DTT-reduced monomeric human construct hK339-K222C/E334C even showed higher ATPase activity after 72 h than 22 h. As controls, important constructs were also assayed untreat"
https://openalex.org/W2043714484,"Transforming growth factor (TGF-β) is involved in several cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. At the cell surface, TGF-β binds to serine-threonine kinase transmembrane receptors (type II and type I) to initiate Smad-dependent intracellular signaling cascades. During the early stages of skeletal muscle differentiation, myotubes start to evoke spontaneous electrical activity in association with contractions that arise following the maturation of the excitation-contraction apparatus. In this work, we report that TGF-β-dependent signaling is regulated by electrical activity in developing rat primary myotubes, as determined by Smad2 phosphorylation, Smad4 nuclear translocation, and p3TPLux reporter activity. This electrical activity-dependent regulation is associated with changes in TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) levels, correlated with changes in transducing receptors at the cell membrane (measured through radiolabeling binding assays). The inhibition of electrical activity with tetrodotoxin, a voltage-dependent sodium channel blocker, increases TβRI levels via a transcription-dependent mechanism. In contrast, the promotion of electrical activity in myotube cultures, induced by the up-regulation of voltage-dependent sodium channels or by direct stimulation with extracellular electrodes, causes TβRI levels to decrease. Similar results were obtained in denervated adult muscles, suggesting that electrical activity-dependent regulation of TβRI also occurs in vivo. Additional results suggest that this activity-dependent regulation is mediated by myogenin. Altogether, these findings support the possibility for a novel regulatory mechanism acting on TGF-β signaling cascade in skeletal muscle cells.

TGF-β signaling cascades initiate after ligand binding with the heterodimerization of type II (TβRII) and type I (TβRI) TGF-β receptors at the cell surface. This induces the phosphorylation of R-Smad proteins, such as Smad2 and Smad3, the association with co-Smads, such as Smad4, and their translocation to the nucleus in order to promote the transcription of target genes (3Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4693) Google Scholar). Several regulatory mechanisms for these TGF-β signaling pathways have been described, including modification of transducing receptor turnover (induced by ligand binding, cell membrane distribution, and I-Smads) and cytoplasm-nuclear transport and half-life of Smad proteins (4ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle cells, TGF-β acts as a strong inhibitor of myogenesis. It is known that TGF-β can inhibit myoblast differentiation in vitro, affecting the expression of muscle proteins such as myosin heavy chain and creatine kinase (5Massagué J. Cheifetz S. Endo T. Nadal-Ginard B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8206-8210Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Cell sensitivity to TGF-β-derived inhibition decreases during myoblast differentiation, and recent studies support a Smad3-mediated mechanism for this suppression (6Liu D. Kang J.S. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On the other hand, skeletal muscle cells develop excitability and contractile properties during the first stages of myogenesis. This phenotype has been associated to the onset of voltage-dependent channel protein expression (sodium and calcium channels) and to the maturation of the excitation-contraction apparatus (7Brodie C. Brody M. Sampson S.R. Brain Res. 1989; 488: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Cognard C. Constantin B. Rivet-Bastide Imbert Besse N. C. Raymond G.

Pflugers Arch. 1991; 418: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At more advanced developmental stages, muscle activity is controlled by motor innervation (10Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Denervation has been the classical model to study the in vivo regulatory properties of electrical activity on muscle protein expression. Studies using this model have demonstrated that several myogenic factors, such as myogenin and MyoD, and ligand-activated and voltage-dependent channels, such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and sodium channels, are up-regulated after denervation (11Eftimie R. Brenner H.R. Buonanno A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 12Sherman S.J. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 753-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similar results, whereby voltage-dependent sodium channels and nAChR are up-regulated, have been reported for primary myotube cultures after blocking spontaneous electrical activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX) (13Sherman S.J. Catterall W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Dutton E.K. Simon A.M. Burden S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2040-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The aim of the work presented here was to evaluate whether TGF-β signaling cascade could be modulated in skeletal muscle cells by an intrinsic property such as electrical activity. Our results demonstrate that such electrical activity modulation occurs in rat primary myotubes through the modification of TGF-β transducing receptor levels. TβRI at the cell surface was up-regulated following inhibition of spontaneous electrical activity involving transcriptional activation and down-regulated when this activity was promoted, pointing to a novel mechanism for the control of TGF-β signaling pathways in skeletal muscle cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that this electrical activity-dependent modulation also occurred in adult skeletal muscles after motor denervation, and additional analyses suggested a myogenin-dependent mechanism. Animals and Muscle Denervation—2-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with xylazine/ketamine, and right legs were denervated by a sciatic section of 0.5 cm in the hip region of the hind limb as previously described (15Fadic R. Brandan E. Inestrosa N.C. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3516-3523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 72 h, tibialis anterior muscle was excised for analysis. Muscles from contralateral legs were used as controls. For protein extracts, muscle tissue was frozen with liquid nitrogen, triturated, and homogenized in buffer containing 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Extracts were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min and supernatants collected and analyzed for protein quantification. Cell Cultures—Rat skeletal myoblasts were isolated from the hind legs of day 19 Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses. Briefly, muscle mass was dissected from bones, subjected to mechanic dissociation, and filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer. Cell suspensions were preplated to eliminate fibroblasts, and non-adherent cells were plated onto collagen-coated culture dishes at a density of 100,000 cells/ml. Myoblasts were grown at 37 °C with 8% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal serum and 10% horse serum. After 48 h, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 10% horse serum to induce myotube formation with 10 μm cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside to inhibit fibroblast proliferation. Under these conditions, primary myotubes showed spontaneous contractions as of day 2 in differentiation medium. To inhibit electrical activity, 1 μg/ml of TTX (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) was added to cell cultures at day 1 of differentiation. Electrical Stimulation—Primary cultures were stimulated as described by Chahine et al. (16Chahine K.G. Walke W. Goldman D. Development. 1992; 115: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation electrodes were immersed in culture medium, and myotubes were stimulated using a Grass stimulator with 0.4-ms 4-V pulses (threshold required to induce visible contractions) in 100-Hz trains lasting 1 s, applied once every 100 s for 12 h. DNA Transfections—Primary myoblast cultures were transfected with 2 μg of p3TP-Lux or 2 μg of δ-47MEKLuc and 0.01 μg of pRLSV40 using the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method (17Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar, 18Riquelme C. Larrain J. Schönherr E. Henriquez J.P. Kresse H. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3589-3596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After 6 h, cell cultures were subjected to a glycerol shock for 45 s and then induced to differentiate. Three days later, p3TPLux activity was determined by incubating cultures with 1 ng/ml of TGF-β1 for 12 h and then harvesting for luciferase assay. Western Blotting—Proteins were extracted from primary cultures using phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce). Samples were electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with one of the following antibodies: rabbit anti-TβRI (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-Pan-Nav (1:200) (Alomone), rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2 (1:1000) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), goat anti-Smad2 (1:250) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-Smad4 (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-myogenin (1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-GADPH (1:5000) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10000) (Pierce), reactive proteins were visualized using chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce). For the detection of phospho-Smad2, proteins were extracted in radioimmune precipitation buffer plus protease inhibitors. Cross-linking Assays—TGF-β1 was radiolabeled with 125I using chloramine T, and affinity labeling was carried out for 4 h at 4 °C using disuccinimidyl suberate as cross-linking reagent (Pierce). Samples were analyzed by 8–12% gradient SDS-PAGE as previously described (19López-Casillas F. Riquelme C. Pérez-Kato Y. Ponce-Castañeda M.V. Osses N. Esparza-López J. González-Núñez G.

Immunocytochemistry Analysis—Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100, and incubated with 1:100 monoclonal anti-Smad4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound antibodies were detected by incubating the cells with 1:100 affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Pierce). After rinsing, the slides were viewed through a Nikon upright microscope equipped with epifluorescence. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from primary myotubes using TRIzol® (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA previously treated with DNase I, primed with random primers, and reversed transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. PCR cycling conditions for rat TβRI were 31 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a 7-min final extension at 72 °C. For β-actin 25 cycles were used for the same cycling protocol. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The primers for TβRI were 5-TGGTCTTGCCCATCTTCACA-3 (sense) and 5-ATTGCATAGATGTCAGCACG-3 (antisense), which yielded a PCR product of 279 bp (20Zhao Y. Young S.L. McIntosh J.C. Steele M.P. Silbajoris R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L1231-L1239PubMed Google Scholar). The primers for rat β-actin were 5-TCTACAATGAGCTGCGTGTG-3 (sense) and 5-TACATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAA-3 (antisense), which yielded a PCR product of 131 bp. TGF-β-dependent Signaling Is Heightened in Inactive Primary Myotubes—To determine whether electrical activity can modulate TGF-β cascade components in skeletal muscle cells undergoing differentiation, we analyzed the effect of inhibiting electrical activity in rat primary myotubes using TTX. These cells develop spontaneous electrical activity, together with visible contractions, early during in vitro differentiation. To begin with, the TGF-β-dependent intracellular cascade that triggers Smad-dependent pathways was examined by measuring the phosphorylation of Smad2 induced by TGF-β in control and TTX-treated primary myotubes. Fig. 1A shows that in TTX-treated cells the TGF-β-dependent phosphorylation of Smad2 was detectable at lower ligand concentrations than in control myotubes. In the same figure, the dose-response curves for this TGF-β-dependent phosphorylation are shown following band quantification. Next, we determined whether the Smad-dependent downstream steps of the TGF-β signaling cascade were also affected by TTX treatment. For this, the nuclear translocation of Smad4 was analyzed by indirect immunolocalization. Fig. 1B shows that after TGF-β incubation the distribution of Smad4 in active primary myotubes remained cytosolic and excluded the nuclei, whereas in TTX-treated myotubes it concentrated in the nuclei, supporting the idea that in inactive myotubes the responsiveness to TGF-β is increased. To evaluate whether the TGF-β-induced transcription of target genes was also affected in TTX-treated myotubes, we transfected primary cultures with the TGF-β-responsive reporter p3TP-Lux (21Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Reporter activity increased ∼4-fold in TTX-treated myotubes with respect to control cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting a more activated Smad-dependent TGF-β pathway in inactive myotubes than in control cells. Moreover, Fig. 1D shows that total Smad2 and Smad4 protein levels were not altered by TTX treatment, implying that the enhanced Smad2 phosphorylation and Smad4 nuclear translocation observed in inactive myotubes in response to TGF-β must be associated to an upstream variation in the signaling cascade. Total and Cell Surface TGF-β Type I Receptor Levels Are Increased in TTX-treated Myotubes—To better understand the increased TGF-β responsiveness of inactive myotubes, we decided to measure protein levels of TβRI using Western blot analysis. A rise in TβRI protein levels was seen during primary myoblast differentiation (Fig. 2A), with a more notable increase observed upon inhibition of electrical activity at 48 or 72 h (cultures at day 4 or 5 of differentiation, respectively). To determine whether this augmentation in total TβRI levels corresponded to an increase in the number of cell surface receptors, we analyzed the receptor binding of radiolabeled 125I-TGF-β1 through affinity labeling experiments. Fig. 2B shows that labeling associated to TGF-β/TβRI complex was higher in TTX-treated myotubes than in control cells (153% ± 4.1 S.E., n = 3), suggesting that the rise in TβRI protein levels obtained after blocking electrical activity also corresponds to an increase in membrane receptors at the cell surface. Altogether, these results indicate that the heightened responsiveness to TGF-β of inactive myotubes as evaluated by determining the dose-response curves of Smad2 phosphorylation, Smad4 nuclear translocation, and p3TPLux reporter activity is consistent with the up-regulation of the transducing receptor TβRI as a result of TTX exposure. TTX-dependent Increase in TGF-β Type I Receptor Levels Involves Transcriptional Activation—To determine whether the electrical activity-dependent up-regulation of TβRI occurs at a transductional and/or transcriptional level, at first we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Fig. 3A shows that PCR product corresponding to TβRI transcripts is increased in TTX-treated myotubes compared with control cultures (lanes 1 and 4). To estimate half-life values for TβRI transcripts in control and inactive cultures we analyzed the time-dependent decrease in PCR product after incubation with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole). Fig. 3A, lower plots, show that the half-life values extracted from decay of PCR product are almost identical in control and TTX-treated cultures (9.5 and 9.4 h, respectively). These results suggest that increased TβRI RNA levels in TTX-treated cultures are due to an increased transcription rate and not to an increased stability (half-life) of transcripts. To confirm that TTX-dependent increase in TβRI receptor levels requires transcription we studied the effect of DRB on receptor protein levels. Fig. 3B shows that TTX-induced TβRI up-regulation could be blocked by DRB, indicating that this activity-dependent up-regulation required transcription as a prior step. Furthermore, the induction of TβRI by chronic exposure to TTX (for 72 h) could also be progressively inhibited by DRB as seen in Fig. 3C. These results demonstrate that the onset and maintenance of TβRI up-regulation in paralyzed cultures is dependent on transcription. On the other hand, to evaluate whether the increase in TβRI observed at the plasma membrane in TTX-treated myotubes could result from a lower receptor degradation rate, we analyzed the recovery of receptor levels using chloroquine (a lysosomal degradation inhibitor) in cycloheximide-treated cultures. Fig. 4 shows that the inhibition of the lysosomal pathway had a lesser effect on receptor recovery in TTX-treated cultures, pointing to the attenuation of this pathway in inactive myotubes. Similarly, a reduced recovery of TβRI was also noted in TTX-treated cells after inhibition of the proteasome protein degradation pathway, using MG132 (lanes 4 and 8). Altogether, these results support the notion that the up-regulation of TβRI in inactive myotubes involves both a transcriptional activation and a reduction in the lysosome- and proteasome-dependent degradation of the receptor. Myotube Hyperexcitability and Direct Stimulation Decrease TGF-β Type I Receptor Protein Levels—To test whether enhanced electrical activity in primary myotubes could negatively regulate TβRI protein levels, we analyzed the influence of cell excitability under two experimental conditions (Figs. 5 and 6). The action of TTX over voltage-dependent sodium channels is known to be reversible, and its inhibitory effect can be restored by rinsing the toxin (22Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 15-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). When rat primary myotubes chronically treated with TTX were washed to restore their electrical activity, this activity together with visible contractions was higher than in control cultures. This hyperexcitable phenotype is consistent with a TTX-dependent up-regulation of voltage-sensitive sodium channels (see below). Therefore, TβRI protein levels were determined under these conditions in which primary myotubes were allowed to recuperate their electrical activity. Fig. 5A shows that TβRI protein levels were significantly lower in myotubes treated with TTX, washed, and lysed 12 h later (w12) than in untreated (C, control) or unwashed (TTX) myotubes. The lower panel shows that myogenin protein levels followed the same pattern of electrical activity-dependent regulation. It is remarkable that after such a short period of time as 12 h the up-regulation of TβRI could be reverted and levels seen to decrease below those of controls. These findings indicate that receptor expression can be modulated in both directions (up- and down-regulated) by modifying the electrical activity of the myotubes. As Fig. 5B shows, the change in receptor protein levels in w12 myotubes also correlated with a reduced binding of radiolabeled TGF-β1, suggesting that receptors at the cell surface were also diminished. This activity-dependent decrease in TGF-β1 receptor binding was greatest after 24 h. Considering that in Western blot experiments electrical activity recovery was evident after 12 h, a temporal delay between transductional responses and receptor translocation to the cell membrane can be inferred. Fig. 5B also shows that the re-inhibition of electrical activity 12 h after rinsing (lane reTTX) resulted in higher TβRI ligand binding compared with cultures washed without the readdition of TTX(w24), demonstrating that electrical activity-dependent down-regulation of TβRI is reversible. Furthermore, TβRI down-regulation caused an effect on the Smad-dependent intracellular signaling cascade, as seen in Fig. 5C. TGF-β-dependent p3TPLux reporter activity in blocked and washed cultures (w12) was below that measured in untreated myotubes. All these results indicate that recovered electrical activity in w12 myotubes down-regulates TβRI protein levels, decreasing the number of functional transducer receptors at the cell surface and lowering the responsiveness of primary myotubes to TGF-β.FIGURE 6TβRI is down-regulated by electrical stimulation in primary myotubes. A, Western blot for TβRI using protein extracts taken at day 4 of myotube differentiation from control and cells stimulated for 12 h (STIM12). GADPH immunostaining is shown as a loading control. B, Western blot for myogenin, using total extracts from control myotubes and TTX-treated myotubes and stimulated for 12 h (STIM12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that lower TβRI levels in w12 myotubes correlated with a rise in electrical activity in these cultures, we transfected primary myotubes with the δ-47MEKLuc reporter plasmid in which a minimal promoter sequence of encephalin (MEK) is under the control of an enhancer sequence (47 bp) from the nAChR δ subunit. This enhancer sequence confers electrical activity-dependent regulatory properties to a heterologous promoter that result in the down-regulation of gene expression (23Walke W. Xiao G. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5D, w12 myotubes presented a lower reporter activity than control cells, denoting greater electrical activity in recovered myotubes than in untreated cultures. The increased reporter activity in TTX-treated cells is in concordance with the inhibition of spontaneous electrical activity as previously described for denervated muscles and inactive primary cultures (23Walke W. Xiao G. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tang H. Macpherson P. Argetsinger L.S. Cieslak D. Suhr S.T. Carter-Su C. Goldman D. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Voltage-dependent sodium channels are required to generate action potentials, giving rise in cultured skeletal muscle cells to a linear relationship between ion channel levels and the frequency of action potentials (7Brodie C. Brody M. Sampson S.R. Brain Res. 1989; 488: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the up-regulation of sodium channels can be induced by the denervation of adult muscle as well as after blockade of electrical activity in muscle cell cultures by TTX (12Sherman S.J. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 753-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Sherman S.J. Catterall W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fig. 5E shows a progressive increase in sodium channel levels during the differentiation of primary myotubes, with a clear up-regulation in TTX-treated myotubes. Moreover, Fig. 5F shows that 12 h after rinsing off TTX (w12) sodium channel protein levels remained higher than in control myotubes. This result is consistent with a half-life >24 h for muscle sodium channels, estimated from experiments using DRB (data not shown). Together, these results show that w12 myotubes washed after chronic exposure to TTX exhibit enhanced electrical activity with regard to untreated cultures as measured through a reduction in δ-47MEKLuc reporter activity. This hyperexcitable phenotype, compatible with a higher sodium channel content, leads to a reduction in TβRI protein levels, suggesting that electrical activity negatively regulates this receptor in skeletal muscle cells. The second approach used to study the electrical activity-dependent regulation of TβRI was to investigate whether direct electrical stimulation of primary myotubes could also negatively modulate receptor levels. Electrical activity was induced in primary myotubes by stimulating with extracellular electrodes. This method has been successfully employed in studying the electrical activity-dependent expression of several muscle proteins, such nAChR and myogenin (25Chahine K.G. Baracchini E. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Macpherson P. Kostrominova T. Tang H. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15638-15646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fig. 6A shows that electrical stimulation for 12 h (STIM12) significantly decreased TβRI protein levels in primary myotubes, as expected. Fig. 6B shows that the electric stimulation protocol was also effective in down-regulating myogenin expression as described before (25Chahine K.G. Baracchini E. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Macpherson P. Kostrominova T. Tang H. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15638-15646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Electrical Activity-dependent Regulation of TGF-β Type I Receptor Occurs in Vivo in Adult Skeletal Muscle—The next question was to determine whether the activity-dependent regulation of TβRI observed in primary cultures also occurred in adult skeletal muscle in vivo. For this, we measured receptor protein levels in rat hind limb muscles after short-term motor denervation. Fig. 7 shows that 72 h after denervation, receptor levels increased in tibialis anterior compared with innervated contralateral muscles. Additionally, the middle panel shows that denervated muscles exhibited increased myogenin levels with respect to controls, as has been extensively documented (11Eftimie R. Brenner H.R. Buonanno A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This result demonstrates that in adult skeletal muscles in vivo, TβRI protein levels are also modulated by electrical activity, supporting the notion that this control mechanism is maintained after differentiation of skeletal muscle cells.

https://openalex.org/W1993881153,"The complex apoptotic functions of the p53 tumor suppressor are central to its antineoplastic activity in vivo. Besides its well-known action as a transcriptional activator of apoptotic genes, p53 exerts a direct proapoptotic role at the mitochondria via protein–protein interactions with Bcl2 family members, thus executing the shortest known circuitry of p53 death signaling. We recently reported that exclusive delivery of p53 to mitochondria exerts a significant in vivo tumor suppressor activity in p53-null lymphomas. However, it was unknown whether mitochondrially targeted p53 has suppressor activities in tumors harboring missense mutants, which constitute the vast majority of p53 alterations in human tumors. Here, we show that targeting p53 to mitochondria does confer a significant growth disadvantage in B-lymphomas expressing various point mutants of p53, resulting in efficient apoptosis induction in vitro and in vivo in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2064809052,"The tricarboxylate carrier (TCC), also known as citrate carrier, is an integral protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane. It is an essential component of the shuttle system by which mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, primer for both fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, is transported into the cytosol, where lipogenesis occurs. The effect of hypothyroidism on the activity and expression of the hepatic mitochondrial TCC was investigated in this study. TCC activity was significantly decreased in hypothyroid rats as compared with euthyroid animals. This hormone deficiency effect was due to a reduction in the amount of carrier protein, which resulted from a proportionate decrease of the specific mRNA. Hypothyroidism did not influence TCC mRNA stability. On the other hand, nuclear run-on assay revealed that the transcriptional rate of TCC mRNA decreased by ∼40% in the nuclei from hypothyroid versus euthyroid rats. In addition, the ribonuclease protection assay showed that, in the nuclei of hypothyroid rats, the ratio of mature to precursor RNA decreased, indicating that the splicing of TCC RNA is affected. Furthermore, we found that the ratio of polyadenylated/unpolyadenylated TCC RNA as well as the length of the TCC RNA poly(A) tail were similar in both euthyroid and hypothyroid rats. Thus, the rate of formation of the TCC 3′-end is not altered in hypothyroidism.

Thyroid hormones have a profound influence on normal development, differentiation, and metabolism (1Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are considered possible subcellular loci of thyroid hormone action in view of their crucial role in energy metabolism (2Goglia F. Moreno M. Lanni A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial function can be regulated by thyroid hormones both indirectly in a “nuclear mediated” way and directly through interaction with some mitochondrial component (2Goglia F. Moreno M. Lanni A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3Weitzel J.M. Iwen K.A. Seitz H.J. Exp. Physiol. 2003; 88.1: 121-128Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Hypothyroidism is associated with a considerable decrease in basic metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, and rates of oxidation of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids (4Tata J.R. Ernster L. Lindberg O. Arrhenius E. Pedersen S. Hedman R. Biochem. J. 1963; 86: 408-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 5Moreno M. Lanni A. Lombardi A. Goglia F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 529-538Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, thyroid hormones dramatically affect the extent to which liver contributes to total lipogenesis in rat. This contribution ranges from 5% in the hypothyroid animals to 34% in the hyperthyroid animals (6Freake H.C. Schwartz H.L. Oppenheimer J.H. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2868-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fatty acid synthesis in rat liver is extremely responsive to the thyroid status of the organism. Hypothyroidism in developing or adult rats depresses hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS) 2The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthase; TCC, tricarboxylate carrier; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; T3, tri-iodothyronine; pre-mRNA, precursor mRNA; UTR, untranslated region; nt, nucleotide(s). activity by 50% (7Hoch F.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 1988; 27: 199-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cultures of hepatocytes obtained from hypothyroid rats synthesize fatty acids from acetate half as fast as euthyroid hepatocytes (8Gnoni G.V. Geelen M.J.H. Bijleveld C. Quagliariello E. Van den Bergh S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities of de novo fatty acid synthesis, i.e. acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and FAS, are greatly increased in hyperthyroid rats (9Roncari D.A. Murthy V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4134-4138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Landriscina C. Gnoni G.V. Quagliariello E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 71: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and, conversely, strongly reduced in propylthiouracil-induced hypothyroid rats (10Landriscina C. Gnoni G.V. Quagliariello E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 71: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, rat thyroidectomy decreases the activities of FAS and other lipogenic enzymes such as malic enzyme and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (11Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). It has been shown that tri-iodothyronine (T3) regulates fatty acid synthesis by altering the expression of the genes coding for the lipogenic enzymes (12Blenneman B. Lehay P. Kim T.S. Freake H.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 110: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Different molecular mechanisms have been reported for this regulation. FAS in avian liver (13Goodridge A.G. Back D.W. Wilson S.B. Goldman M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 478: 46-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and in chick embryo hepatocytes (14Stapleton S.R. Mitchell D.A. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18442-18446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the putative lipogenic enzyme S14 protein in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes (15Mariash C.N. Jump D.B. Oppenheimer J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 1122-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and in rat liver (16Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4698-4703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are transcriptionally regulated by T3, whereas it has been proposed that, in rats, T3 is involved not only in ACC transcription (17Huang C. Freake H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but also in ACC mRNA stability (18Katsurada A. Iritani N. Fukuda H. Matsumura Y. Noguchi T. Tanaka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms have been suggested for T3 regulation of the malic enzyme gene (19Song M.-H.K. Dozin B. Grieco J. Rall E. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17970-17974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Salati L.M. Ma X.J. McCornick C.C. Stapleton S.R. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4010-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T3 increases the ATP-citrate lyase content by changes in the rate of enzyme synthesis, which in turn correlate with the abundance of the corresponding mRNA (11Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Lipogenesis requires cooperation between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic enzymes and involves fluxes of metabolites across the mitochondrial membranes (21Watson J.A. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5993-6002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inner membrane of rat liver mitochondria contains a specific carrier, i.e. tricarboxylate carrier, for the outward transport of citrate. The activity of TCC is strictly correlated with the rate of lipogenesis and represents a link between carbohydrate catabolism and fatty acid synthesis. In fact, it exports from mitochondria to the cytosol (in the form of citrate) acetyl-CoA mainly derived from sugar sources, thus providing the carbon units for fatty acid and cholesterol biosyntheses. In addition, it supplies NAD+ and NADPH that support cytosolic glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis, respectively (22Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). TCC may have important physiological functions in gluconeogenesis as well (23Kaplan R.S. Oliveira D.L. Wilson G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The characteristics of this transporting system have been extensively investigated (for review, see Ref. 24Palmieri F. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), but little is known concerning its regulation. It has been reported that TCC activity is altered in type I diabetes (23Kaplan R.S. Oliveira D.L. Wilson G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), can be regulated by exogenous insulin (25Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Blackwell R. Maughan R.H. Wilson G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and is enhanced during hyperthyroidism (26Paradies G. Ruggiero F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recent reports from our laboratory showed that, in parallel with lipogenic enzyme activities, TCC activity is controlled by various nutritional states (27Zara V. Giudetti A.M. Siculella L. Palmieri F. Gnoni G.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5734-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Siculella L. Sabetta S. di Summa R. Leo M. Giudetti A.M. Palmieri F. Gnoni G.V. Biochem.

To our knowledge, there has been no report assessing mitochondrial TCC activity relative to the hypothyroid state, and no study so far has gone deep into the hormonal regulation at the molecular level of any gene for a mitochondrial carrier protein. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether hypothyroidism affects TCC activity and expression and, if so, to characterize the molecular step(s) for this hormonal TCC gene modulation. We showed that the reduced TCC activity observed in the hypothyroid state can be ascribed to either a transcriptional and a post-transcriptional TCC gene regulation. Chemicals—[α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Milan, Italy). [14C]Citrate (specific activity, 100 mCi/mmol) and nylon filters Hybond N+ were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega (Milan, Italy). RNase-free DNase I, α-amanitin, actinomycin D, and 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylic acid were purchased from Sigma. The protein assay kit was from Bio-Rad. The T3 RNA polymerase, RPAIII kit, RNase inhibitor, and β-actin antisense control template were obtained from Celbio (Milan, Italy). ANT2 antibody (D. B. A. Italia, Milan, Italy) was commercially available. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Animal Treatments—Male Wistar rats (150–200 g) were used throughout this study. They were housed in cages in a temperature (22 ± 1 °C)- and light (light on 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.)-controlled room and randomly assigned to one of two different groups. The first one is the control group and will be further referred to as euthyroid. The second group was made chronically hypothyroid by continuous administration of 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (0.1% w/v, in drinking tap water) for 3–4 weeks (30Ruggiero F.M. Gnoni G.V. Quagliariello E. Lipids. 1987; 22: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both groups had free access to food that was a commercial mash (Morini Spa, Milan, Italy). The experimental design was in accordance with local and national guidelines covering animal experiments. Tricarboxylate Translocase Activity Assay—Rat liver mitochondria were prepared by differential centrifugation of the liver homogenates essentially as described previously (31Palmieri F. Stipani I. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial integrity was monitored by measuring the respiratory control ratio. TCC activity was assayed in freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria as reported in Ref. 31Palmieri F. Stipani I. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar. The malate/citrate exchange reaction was started by the addition to malate-loaded mitochondria (1–1.5 mg of protein) of 0.5 mm [14C]citrate and terminated by adding the inhibitor 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylic acid at 12.5 mm (31Palmieri F. Stipani I. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Immediately after the addition of the inhibitor, the tubes were rapidly centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 5 min at 2 °C, washed, and extracted with 20% HClO4. The mixture was then centrifuged, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was counted. Isolation of RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—Approximately 15 μg of total RNA, extracted from the livers of hypothyroid and euthyroid rats, according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), was size-fractionated by electrophoresis through denaturing 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane. The RNA blots were hybridized with three α-32P-labeled probes corresponding to nucleotides 459–1421 of rat liver TCC cDNA (33Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13682-13690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nucleotides 91–280 of rat liver adenine nucleotide translocase isoform 2 (ANT2) cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_057102), and nucleotides 613–726 of the ubiquitously expressed rat liver VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel, isoform 1) (also known as mitochondrial porin) cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_031353), respectively. For normalization of the hybridization signals, the same membranes were hybridized using a probe encoding for part of the human β-actin. Membranes were exposed to x-ray film, and the intensity of the resulting bands was evaluated by densitometry with Molecular Analyst software. Immunoelectrophoretic Analysis—Western blots were carried out as reported in Ref. 29Giudetti A.M. Sabetta S. di Summa R. Leo M. Damiano F. Siculella L. Gnoni G.V. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2135-2141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar. Membranes were submitted to the reaction with the first antibody directed against a C-terminal peptide of rat liver TCC (29Giudetti A.M. Sabetta S. di Summa R. Leo M. Damiano F. Siculella L. Gnoni G.V. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2135-2141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), ANT2, or porin. Porin, the mitochondrial outer membrane channel, was used as a control, because its expression is not affected by thyroid hormones (34Yehuda-Shnaidman E. Kalderon B. Bar-Tana J. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2462-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The bound antibody was revealed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide as substrates. The blots were evaluated by densitometric analysis with Molecular Analyst software. Isolation of Nuclei and Nuclear Run-on Assay—Nuclei were isolated from hepatocytes obtained by liver perfusion and collagenase digestion as reported by Gnoni et al. (8Gnoni G.V. Geelen M.J.H. Bijleveld C. Quagliariello E. Van den Bergh S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After isolation, hepatocytes were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 1 ml of buffer 1 (0.3 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 15 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P40) by homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer. The crude nuclei were purified by centrifugation through a 2.0 m sucrose cushion as described by Siculella et al. (28Siculella L. Sabetta S. di Summa R. Leo M. Giudetti A.M. Palmieri F. Gnoni G.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and stored at –80 °C in aliquots (210 μl) of storage buffer (50% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing ∼1 × 108 nuclei each for analysis later. Nuclei suspension was used in a nuclear run-on assay as described by Liu et al. (35Liu Y. Sun L. Jost J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2718-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The newly transcribed RNA was extracted as indicated above and hybridized to Hybond N+ nylon membranes as reported by Siculella et al. (28Siculella L. Sabetta S. di Summa R. Leo M. Giudetti A.M. Palmieri F. Gnoni G.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were quantified as described above. mRNA Turnover Assay—Hepatocytes from hypothyroid and euthyroid rats were maintained on plastic Petri dishes (60 mm) until monolayer formation (8Gnoni G.V. Geelen M.J.H. Bijleveld C. Quagliariello E. Van den Bergh S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and after 2-h plating, 4 μg/ml actinomycin D in Ham's F-12 medium was added. At different times, 10 plates (∼4 × 106 cells/plate) from each group were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was extracted as described above. For each time point, aliquots of 10 μg of RNA were loaded on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, electrophoresed, and transferred onto nylon membranes. Northern blot hybridization was carried out as indicated above using TCC cDNA as a probe. The same filter was stripped by washing twice in a boiling solution of 0.1% SDS and rehybridized with β-actin cDNA. The autoradiogram was quantified by densitometric scanning. Isolation of Nuclear RNA—The isolated nuclei were lysed by adding 4 ml of denaturing solution (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine). RNA isolation was carried out as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Probe Designed for the Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Several probes were designed for use in the ribonuclease protection assay. They were obtained by PCR amplification of a genomic clone p5B8 containing the TCC gene (data not shown) using specific primers as previously reported (36Siculella L. Damiano F. Sabetta S. Gnoni G.V. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first designed probe (see Fig. 5A), intron 3-exon 4 (I3-E4), was amplified using the following primers: rp1, 5′-GAATTCTGCTGCAGGAACGACCAGGA-3′ and rp2, 5′-AAGCTTCACGGTCTCCATGGG-3′. The second designed probe, exon 7-intron7, was amplified using the following primers: rp3, 5′-GAATTCGAGACAACCCCAACAAGCC-3′ and rp4, 5′-AAGCTTCTGCAGGACGCAGCAAGCC-3′. The third designed probe, exon 8-intron 8 (E8-I8) (see Fig. 5A) was obtained using the following primers: rp5, 5′-GAATTCGGCCTGGAGGCACACAAATAC-3′ and rp6, 5′-AAGCTTCTGGGTAGAGCAGAGAGCC-3. For subcloning purposes, an EcoRI site was added at the 5′-end of the primers rp1, rp3, and rp5, whereas a HindIII site was added at the 5′-end of the primers rp2, rp4, and rp6 (underlined). The amplified products were subcloned into pBlueskript II vector. After linearization, the recombinant plasmids were used in the in vitro transcription reactions. The β-actin probe, which was used as a control for RNA loading, was made from the pTRI-β-actin-125-Rat antisense control template (Ambion). When this plasmid was transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase antisense, transcripts of 160 nt are produced, and their hybridization to rat total RNA protects a 126-nt fragment derived from exon 5 of rat β-actin. The fourth TCC probe spans the polyadenylation/cleavage site in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) so that it can detect the abundance of polyadenylated RNA after cleavage, as well as uncleaved RNA in a RNase protection assay. DNA was amplified by PCR of a genomic clone p5B8, using the following primers: rp7, 5′-GTGCAGAAGCTTACCGCATTCCAGGGGCTATAG-3′; rp8, 5′-TAAAGGAGCTCTCACTAGGG-3′ located 2759 bp and 3023 bp downstream of the ATG codon, respectively, and designed on the basis of the published rat genome sequence (GenBank™ NW_047358). The amplified sequence was ligated into pBlueskript II vector, and the plasmid was linearized prior to use in the riboprobe synthesis reaction. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—Antisense RNAs were synthesized by an in vitro transcription reaction as reported in Ref. 36Siculella L. Damiano F. Sabetta S. Gnoni G.V. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar. RNA samples were subjected to ribonuclease protection assay using the RPAIII kit and following the instructions given by the supplier. Nuclear RNA (10 μg) was hybridized with 2 × 105 counts/min of 32P-labeled-specific antisense probe in 20 μl of hybridization solution at 50 °C for 16 h. For the normalization, a 2 × 103 counts/min of antisense β-actin 32P-labeled RNA probe with a 100-fold lower activity was added in each hybridization reaction to obtain a signal comparable with the test mRNAs. Probes were also hybridized with 10 μg of yeast RNA used as a control for testing the RNase activity (data not shown). After digestion with RNase A/T1, the protected fragments were separated onto a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried, exposed for autoradiography, and the intensity of the bands was evaluated by densitometry with Molecular Analyst software. RNase H Blot—RNase H analysis was carried out according to Ref. 37Amir-Ahmady B. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10514-10523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. Briefly 15 μg of nuclear RNA was mixed with 50 pmol of a TCC-specific oligonucleotide (5′-CTATTGTATCTGTGTCCAGCCTGGCCGT-3′, nucleotides located 2517 bp downstream ATG codon of the rat genome sequence). The mixture was heated to 70 °C and then, in 10 min, cooled to room temperature (37Amir-Ahmady B. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10514-10523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Digestion with RNase H was for 20 min at 37 °C. The samples were electrophoresed through denaturing 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane, and hybridized with an amplified probe (366 nt) corresponding to the 3′-end of the TCC mRNA, precisely from 2526 to 2892 bp downstream of the ATG codon of the rat genome sequence. Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as means ± S.E. for the number of experiments indicated in each case. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Time Course of Citrate/Malate Exchange—Fig. 1 shows the time course of [14C]citrate exchange by malate-loaded mitochondria from the livers of euthyroid and hypothyroid rats. Citrate/malate exchange was strongly reduced in liver mitochondria from hypothyroid versus euthyroid animals. As shown in this figure, during the linear range (15–30 s) of the reaction, the decrease of the transport activity was reproducibly found to be ∼50% in hypothyroid versus euthyroid animals. Effect of Hypothyroid State on TCC mRNA and Protein Levels in Rat Hepatocytes—To establish whether hypothyroidism affected TCC mRNA and protein levels, Northern and Western blot analyses were carried out. Quantitation of the signals showed that the hypothyroid state caused an ∼30% reduction of the hepatic TCC mRNA level compared with euthyroid rats (Fig. 2A). This figure also shows that, in agreement with a previous report (12Blenneman B. Lehay P. Kim T.S. Freake H.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 110: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the expression of the housekeeping gene for β-actin was unmodified by hypothyroidism. Furthermore, the hepatic abundance of the mRNA for ANT2, the ubiquitous adenine nucleotide translocase isoform 2, was lowered in liver from hypothyroid rats, as reported by Dummler et al. (38Dummler K. Muller S. Seitz H.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas in the liver from the same group of animals, no alteration in the expression of VDAC1 mRNA, coding for porin, was observed. Interestingly, the immunodecoration reported in Fig. 2B revealed also that the TCC and ANT2 protein levels of mitochondria from hypothyroid rats were lowered by ∼35 and 45%, respectively, as compared with euthyroid animals. By contrast, the amount of porin, the mitochondrial outer membrane channel, coded by VDAC mRNA and used as a control, was unaffected by the hypothyroid state. The immunoelectrophoretic results for TCC and ANT2 protein content correlate well with the observed alterations in the corresponding mRNA levels. Turnover of TCC mRNA—We then asked whether the reduction in the hepatic TCC mRNA accumulation in hypothyroid rats could reflect changes in the TCC mRNA stability. To address this question, the apparent half-life of TCC mRNA was estimated. Fig. 3 shows the semilog plot representing the decay curve of TCC mRNA (upper panel) and β-actin mRNA (lower panel) from hypothyroid and euthyroid rat hepatocytes. The apparent half-life of TCC mRNA from both groups of rats was similar (10.7 ± 1.1 h in hypothyroid versus 11.2 ± 0.7 h in euthyroid rats). In the same RNA preparation, the relative rate of degradation of the β-actin mRNA remained constant. Run-on Assay—To investigate whether the decrease in the amount of TCC mRNA observed in the hypothyroid state was controlled at the transcriptional level, a nuclear run-on assay was carried out. Nuclei isolated from hypothyroid and euthyroid rat hepatocyte suspensions were allowed to incorporate [α-32P]UTP. The labeled RNA was extracted and hybridized to dots (5 μg) of TCC cDNA, β-actin cDNA, and pUC19 applied to the filters. β-actin and pUC19 were used for normalization and as a negative control, respectively. Incorporation of [α-32P]UTP into TCC and β-actin transcripts was specifically suppressed by α-amanitin (4 μg/ml) (data not shown), confirming that the labeled RNAs were transcribed by RNA polymerase II. The dot blot hybridization revealed a decrease of ∼40% in the transcriptional rate of TCC mRNA from hypothyroid versus euthyroid rats (Fig. 4). The transcriptional rate of β-actin remained constant in the two groups of rats. Processing of TCC Precursor RNA—To study the effects of the hypothyroid state on the splicing of TCC RNA, we compared the amount of unspliced and spliced TCC RNA in the nuclei of hepatocytes from hypothyroid versus euthyroid rats. For this purpose, we used a ribonuclease protection assay and three probes (I3-E4, E7-I7, and E8-I8) to investigate the processing of the precursor-mRNA (pre-mRNA) (Fig. 5A). The three probes represent discrete locations within the primary transcript and permit quantitative analysis of the amount of pre-mRNA. I3-E4 hybridized across a 3′-splice site, and E7-I7 and E8-I8 hybridized across a 5′-splice site. RNase digestion of each hybrid of probe and target RNA resulted in two types of protected fragments, the longer fragments (intron3-exon4, exon7-intron7, and exon8-intron8) corresponding to unspliced RNA that contains both the exon and the intron sequences and the smaller fragments (exons 4, 7, and 8) corresponding to spliced RNA that contains only the exon sequences. The terms “unspliced” and “spliced” RNA refer to an RNA mix containing one or more of all of the TCC introns, and each probe provides information about the splicing of only 1 of the 8 introns in the TCC gene. Using the E8-I8 probe in the nuclei from hypothyroid rats, the amount of spliced RNA (E8-protected fragment) was ∼2.5-fold greater than the amount of unspliced RNA. To note that, in the nuclei from euthyroid rats, the amount of spliced RNA was ∼5-fold greater than that of unspliced RNA (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the reduction in the amount of spliced RNA in the nuclei of hypothyroid rats compared with euthyroid animals was ∼30%, which is similar to the decrease in the accumulation of the mature TCC RNA measured in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). By contrast, the amount of unspliced RNA was similar in both rats, despite the ∼40% reduction in"

In vitro, topo IV readily distinguishes between the two possible chiralities of crossing segments in a DNA substrate. The enzyme relaxes positive supercoils and left-handed braids 20 times faster, and with greater processivity, than negative supercoils and right-handed braids. Here, we used chemical cross-linking of topo IV to demonstrate that enzyme bound to positively supercoiled DNA is in a different conformation from that bound to other forms of DNA. Using three different reagents, we observed novel cross-linked species of topo IV when positively supercoiled DNA was in the reaction. We show that the ParE subunits are in close enough proximity to be cross-linked only when the enzyme is bound to positively supercoiled DNA. We suggest that the altered conformation reflects efficient binding by topo IV of the two DNA segments that participate in the strand passage reaction.

We suggest that the altered conformation reflects efficient binding by topo IV of the two DNA segments that participate in the strand passage reaction. The genome of Escherichia coli contains 4.6 megabases of DNA in a single circular chromosome that resides in a nucleoid of less than a μm3 (1Holmes V.F. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1322-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this tight packing of DNA into a confined space, the chromosome may become tangled during replication or recombination. Removal of these detrimental tangles is accomplished by type I and type II topoisomerases, which transiently cleave one or both strands of DNA, respectively, and pass another strand or duplex through the break before religation (for review, see Ref. 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). E. coli has two essential type II enzymes: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (topo IV) 2The abbreviations used are: topo IV, topoisomerase IV; (–), negative; (+), positive; G, gate; T, transport; (+)-SC, positively supercoiled; (–)-SC, negatively supercoiled; GA, glutaraldehyde; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; sulfo-EGS, ethylene glycobis(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate); σ, superhelical density. 2The abbreviations used are: topo IV, topoisomerase IV; (–), negative; (+), positive; G, gate; T, transport; (+)-SC, positively supercoiled; (–)-SC, negatively supercoiled; GA, glutaraldehyde; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; sulfo-EGS, ethylene glycobis(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate); σ, superhelical density. (for review, see Ref. 3Levine C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Gyrase is required to maintain the negative ((–)) supercoiling of the chromosome by virtue of its unique ability to introduce (–)-supercoils into DNA. This same activity serves during DNA replication to remove positive ((+)) superhelical stress generated ahead of the fork due to unwinding of the DNA duplex. While topo IV assists gyrase in removing (+)-supercoils during DNA replication, its critical role is unlinking the intertwined replicated chromosomes to allow segregation of one copy to each daughter cell at division (4Kato J. Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 5Zechiedrich E.L. Cozzarelli N.R.

A. 2000; 97: 9419-9424Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).A remarkable feature of topoisomerases that is key to their in vivo function is the ability to discriminate among DNA substrates differing in topology. This substrate specificity is intrinsic, as it is exhibited in vitro by purified enzymes. For example, topo IV removes catenane and (+)-supercoil links at least 20 times faster than (–)-supercoils (7Ullsperger C. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31549-31555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Crisona N.J. Strick T.R. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Cozzarelli N.R.

A. 2003; 100: 9820-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The active form of topo IV is a tetramer composed of two ParC and two ParE subunits (Fig. 1A) (11Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25286-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). During the catalytic cycle, topo IV binds the gate (G) segment of DNA (Fig. 1B). Upon binding of a second DNA segment, the transport (T) segment, the ParE subunits dimerize around the T segment DNA. The enzyme then cleaves the G segment, passes the T segment through the break and reseals the broken duplex. Topo IV DNA binding and cleavage can proceed in the absence of ATP in vitro, whereas ATP hydrolysis is required for strand passage (8Crisona N.J. Strick T.R. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2881-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basis for substrate discrimination by topo IV was found to be the relative orientation of the G and T segments (9Stone M.D. Bryant Z. Crisona N.J. Smith S.B. Vologodskii A. Bustamante C. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8654-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Charvin G. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2005; 351: 545-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The DNA superhelix is left-handed in positively supercoiled ((+)-SC) DNA and right-handed in negatively supercoiled ((–)-SC) DNA (Fig. 1C). Topo IV removes left-handed crossings 20 times faster than right-handed crossings (9Stone M.D. Bryant Z. Crisona N.J. Smith S.B. Vologodskii A. Bustamante C. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8654-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Charvin G. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9820-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, topo IV relaxes (+)-supercoils more efficiently, because DNA segments with the preferred chirality are found with much higher probability in (+)-SC DNA (9Stone M.D. Bryant Z. Crisona N.J. Smith S.B. Vologodskii A. Bustamante C. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8654-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Additionally, topo IV is far more processive on substrates containing left-handed crossings, removing as many as 80 left-handed but only one or two right-handed crossings in a single burst of activity (8Crisona N.J. Strick T.R. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2881-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Stone M.D. Bryant Z. Crisona N.J. Smith S.B. Vologodskii A.

A. 2003; 100: 9820-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This difference in processivity suggests that, after release of a transported T segment, topo IV has a higher probability of capturing a new T segment with (+)-SC than with (–)-SC DNA before dissociating from the substrate. There may also be a difference in the mode of binding of topo IV to (+)-SC DNA that allows it to remain bound between strand passages.Filter binding assays indicated that topo IV binds equally well to (+)- and (–)-SC DNA (9Stone M.D. Bryant Z. Crisona N.J. Smith S.B. Vologodskii A. Bustamante C. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8654-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, this assay does not distinguish tetramers bound only to a G segment from those bound to both G and T segments. We wished to examine more directly the interaction of topo IV with DNA. In this report, we used chemical cross-linking of topo IV bound to (–)- and (+)-SC DNA to explore whether substrate binding altered the conformation of the enzyme. We found that (+)-SC DNA promoted the formation of a number of cross-linked species not detected in the absence of DNA or in the presence of other topological forms of DNA. Interestingly, we observed cross-linking of ParE into dimers only when topo IV was bound to (+)-SC DNA. As ParE dimerization occurs after T segment binding, we interpret the cross-linking of ParE dimers as a reporter for tetramers that have bound both the G and T segments.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteins—Topoisomerase IV (7Ullsperger C.

DNAs of different (–)- and (+)-σ were prepared as described (8Crisona N.J. Strick T.R. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2881-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Cross-linking Reactions and Analyses—Topo IV cross-linking reactions contained 200 nm topo IV, 100 nm DNA, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol in a 10-μl reaction volume. Proteins were incubated with the DNA for 10 min before the addition of the cross-linking reagent. Glutaraldehyde (Polysciences, EM grade) cross-linking was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min and was terminated by the addition of glycine. Sulfo-EGS (ethylene glycolbis(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate)) and BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate) (Pierce) cross-linking was at 23 °C for 30 min and was terminated by the addition of Tris, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The distance between the reactive groups for the cross-linking reagents is ∼7 Å for glutaraldehyde, 11.4 Å for BS3, and 16.1 Å for Sulfo-EGS.Cross-linked proteins were analyzed on denaturing 4.5% polyacrylamide gels (80:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.1% SDS buffer (pH 7.2) with recirculation of the buffer (17Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by silver staining or Western blotting. Western blot analyses used polyclonal mouse antibodies against ParC or ParE. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce). Proteins were visualized using SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and quantified on an Alpha Innotech ChemiImager or Typhoon 9400 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Isolation of Topo IV·DNA Complexes—Topo IV cross-linking reactions contained 5 mm Sulfo-EGS and (–)-SC, (+)-SC, or no DNA. The reaction was applied to a sizing column containing a 350-μl bed volume of Sepharose CL-2B resin in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 500 mm potassium acetate, the latter to minimize protein aggregation. The fractions containing DNA were determined by analyzing an aliquot of each fraction by agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. The recovered DNA was linearized by digestion with EcoRI. Protein co-eluting with the DNA was analyzed by Western blotting.RESULTSCross-linking of Topo IV in the Absence of DNA—We first characterized the cross-linking of topo IV without DNA so we could determine whether the presence of DNA caused detectible changes in the enzyme. Topo IV was cross-linked with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde (GA), and the products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE (Fig. 2A). We identified dimers, trimers, and tetramers based on their electrophoretic mobility compared with molecular weight standards. We expect that cross-linking between ParC and ParE takes place primarily in the tetramer. Thus, the observed trimers, and some dimers, most likely result from incompletely cross-linked tetramers, which dissociate under the denaturing gel conditions. Importantly, we detected no oligomers larger than tetramers, even at the highest GA concentration, indicating that the cross-linked species reflected subunit interactions within the tetramers and not protein aggregates or dimers of tetramers. When we cross-linked each subunit alone, ParE remained a monomer and ParC was predominantly a dimer (data not shown). For our experiments, we used a relatively low concentration of GA (2 mm), at which monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers could be readily detected, enabling us to monitor the effect of DNA on these species (Fig. 2A, lane 7). A low cross-linker concentration also has the advantage of trapping the most stable subunit interactions.FIGURE 2Cross-linking of topo IV with glutaraldehyde in the absence of DNA.

Fig. 2B shows the results of probing parallel gels with antibodies specific for ParC (lanes 1 and 2) or ParE (lanes 3 and 4). With cross-linked topo IV, dimers, trimers, and tetramers reacted with both antibodies (lanes 2 and 3). The dimer was the major species when ParC was cross-linked alone (lane 1) and the monomer with ParE alone (lane 4).Cross-linking of Topo IV in the Presence of DNA—Using the characterization of species cross-linked in the absence of DNA as a reference, we investigated whether topo IV was altered when bound to DNA. To prevent relaxation of the supercoiled substrates prior to addition of the cross-linking reagent, we omitted ATP from the reactions. We found that the absence of ATP had no detectable qualitative or quantitative effect on the cross-linked species with topo IV (Table 1) or either subunit alone (data not shown) in the absence of DNA. When we cross-linked topo IV in the presence of (+)-SC DNA, we observed a new dimer species (Fig. 3A, lane 4) that did not form with (–)-SC DNA (lane 3) or with either subunit alone (data not shown). The new band was abundant, comprising 60% of the dimers. Based on its electrophoretic mobility we inferred that the band was a dimer of ParE (EE) (Table 2) and confirmed this assignment by Western blot analysis. With a ParE antibody, there were two dimers with (+)-SC DNA (Fig. 3B, lane 2). The slower migrating band is the CE dimer, based on its larger molecular weight. The faster migrating band must then be the EE dimer, which is present in a 10-fold excess over CE. In contrast, with (–)-SC DNA, greater than 80% of the dimers were the slower migrating CE species (Fig. 3B, lane 3): the small amount of EE dimer was not visible by silver staining (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The ParC antibody detected only one dimer band, which co-migrated with that formed with ParC alone, as in Fig. 2B (data not shown). We expect this is primarily the CC dimer and that the CE dimer was obscured by the abundance of CC. The EE cross-linking must have occurred in a complex with ParC associated with the (+)-SC DNA, as both subunits and the DNA were required. The appearance of the EE dimer is significant, because it shows that the ParE subunits are close enough to be cross-linked by GA in tetramers bound to (+)-SC DNA, even in the absence of ATP.TABLE 1Abundance of topo IV cross-linked species in the absence and presence of ATPSpecies% of total protein-ATP+ATPTetramers1115Trimers1217Dimers2421C monomer1413E monomer3934 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Cross-linking of topo IV in the presence of DNA.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 748-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To examine whether these substrates affected topo IV cross-linked species we generated knotted and catenated DNAs using phage λ integrase and cross-linked topo IV in their presence. Fig. 3C shows substantial cross-linking of the EE dimer solely with (+)-SC DNA (lane 2). Only a trace of the EE dimer was detected when the knots and catenanes were (–)-SC (lanes 3 and 4) or nicked (data not shown). Although topo IV can unlink knots and catenanes formed by integrase, the crossings in these substrates are predominantly right-handed, as in (–)-SC DNA (16Crisona N.J. Weinberg R.L. Peter B.J. Sumners D.W. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 747-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Spengler S.J. Stasiak A. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 325-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The EE dimer is efficiently cross-linked only when topo IV is bound to (+)-SC DNA, which contains abundant left-handed crossings.We tested other cross-linking reagents to see if they too exhibited new species when topo IV was bound to (+)-SC DNA. We used BS3 and Sulfo-EGS. These reagents have longer distances between their reactive groups (11.4 and 16.1 Å, respectively) and a higher specificity than GA, reacting only with the ϵ-amine of lysine. We utilized concentrations of these reagents that gave a degree of cross-linking comparable with that of 2 mm GA in titrations and repeated the experiment with topo IV, with or without supercoiled DNAs (Fig. 3D). The results with these cross-linkers were more dramatic. Multiple bands of dimers, trimers, and tetramers were evident only in the reactions containing (+) SC-DNA (lanes 4 and 8). As with GA, the multiple species required topo IV and (+)-SC DNA. There was no effect of (+)-SC DNA on the cross-linking of either subunit alone (data not shown). BS3 and Sulfo-EGS were even more informative than GA in that they showed directly differences in the tetramers assembled on (+)-SC DNA, as well as in the trimers and dimers released from tetramers after denaturation. We do not know whether the different electrophoretic mobilities of the tetramer bands, for example, were due to multiple conformations of the enzyme or different cross-link locations.To examine more closely the effect of DNA supercoiling on tetramer conformation, we cross-linked topo IV with Sulfo-EGS in the presence of DNAs of different superhelical densities (σ) (Fig. 3E). The cross-linked species with (–)-SC (lanes 2–4), relaxed (lane 5), or linear DNA (lane 9) were the same. In contrast, multiple dimer and trimer bands were visible with all three (+)-SC DNAs tested (lanes 6–8), even when the 2.7-kb plasmid contained only two or three supercoils (σ = +0.01). Thus, only a few left-handed crossings in the DNA are sufficient to promote the alterations in topo IV evidenced by the new cross-linked bands. This experiment also demonstrated that the conformational changes we observed are activated by (+)-SC DNA rather than inhibited by (–)-SC DNA.Taken together, the results with three cross-linking reagents show that not only are the ParE subunits in closer proximity but also that there is extensive rearrangement within the topo IV tetramers bound to (+)-SC DNA.Quantification of Topo IV Bound to (–)- and (+)-Supercoiled DNA—As (–)-SC DNA is a poor substrate for topo IV, we wanted to be sure that we were comparing tetramers assembled on (–)- and (+)-SC DNA rather than unbound and bound protein. To address this question, we carried out an experiment to quantify topo IV bound to the DNA after cross-linking. To measure total bound protein, we cross-linked to completion, such that the tetramers would not dissociate on the denaturing gels. We used a high concentration of Sulfo-EGS, at which scant ParC monomer remained. The reaction was then passed over a sizing column, and the fractions containing DNA were collected. The recovered DNA was linearized to allow any proteins topologically linked around the DNA to slide off, and the amount of protein released from the DNA was determined by Western blotting.Fig. 4 shows the results for reactions containing (–)-SC (lanes 1–7) or (+)-SC DNA (lanes 8–14). Compared with the protein applied to the column (lanes 1 and 8), the protein released from the DNA was highly enriched for tetramers (lanes 4, 5, 11, and 12). When we quantified the amount of tetramer bound to (–)- and (+)-SC DNA in two experiments, we found only about 20% more bound to (+)-SC DNA. The control lanes (16Crisona N.J. Weinberg R.L. Peter B.J.

Thus, even though topo IV binds nearly as well to (–)-SC as to (+)-SC DNA, in agreement with previous filter binding data, most of the protein is in a different conformation when bound to (+)-SC DNA. It is the geometry of (+)-SC DNA that effects the conformational change in topo IV.FIGURE 4Western blot analysis of cross-linked topo IV bound to (–)- and (+)-SC DNA. Topo IV was cross-linked to completion with 5 mm Sulfo-EGS in the presence or absence of DNA. Protein eluting with the DNA on a sizing column was analyzed by Western blotting using a ParE antibody. An aliquot of the protein loaded on the column (load) and the protein eluting in the DNA-containing fractions (fx) are shown for reactions containing (–)-SC DNA (lanes 1–7), (+)-SC DNA (lanes 8–14), or no DNA (lanes 15–20). The positions of DNA, tetramers (Tetra), trimers (Tri), dimers (Di), and monomers (Mon) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe carried out chemical cross-linking of topo IV to investigate whether enzyme conformation was affected by DNA substrate structure. We demonstrate that tetramers assembled on (+)-SC DNA have a different conformation, as evidenced by the appearance of new cross-linked species when topo IV is treated with three different reagents in the presence of (+)-SC DNA but not linear, relaxed circular, (–)-SC, knotted, or catenated DNA (Fig. 3). We interpret these new cross-linked species as reflecting conformations of topo IV bound to both G and T segments on (+)-SC DNA.With GA cross-linking, we found that the ParE subunits were in close enough proximity to allow efficient cross-linking only in tetramers bound to (+)-SC DNA. We interpret this juxtaposition of the ParE subunits as the closing of the ParE “gate” that accompanies binding of the T segment (Fig. 5). When topo IV is bound only to the G segment, ParE subunits can be cross-linked to ParC but rarely to each other, as is the case with (–)-SC DNA (Fig. 5A). Here, topo IV cannot readily bind a T segment with the necessary chirality, and most of the ParE-containing dimers released from tetramers upon denaturation also contain ParC (CE dimers). With (+)-SC DNA, topo IV quickly binds a T segment, and the accompanying conformational change enables efficient cross-linking of the ParE subunits to each other (Fig. 5B). Thus, the EE dimer provides an assay to distinguish topo IV bound to G and T segments from those bound to G alone. However, closing of the ParE gate is not the only change accompanying T segment binding. The appearance of multiple species of dimers, trimers, and tetramers when topo IV was cross-linked with Sulfo-EGS and BS3 indicates a global change in the enzyme when bound to (+)-SC DNA.FIGURE 5Model for topo IV tetramers bound to (–)- and (+)-SC DNA. ParE, ParC, and the G and T segments are as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Black and white rectangles represent glutaraldehyde cross-links. A, with (–)-SC DNA, topo IV binds a G segment, but the probability of binding a T segment in the proper orientation is low. ParE monomers are cross-linked to ParC but not to each other. B, with (+)-SC DNA, topo IV readily binds a T segment, resulting in an altered global enzyme conformation in which the ParE dimer is efficiently cross-linked.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We observed only a trace of ParE dimer cross-linking with catenated DNA, even though decatenation of daughter chromosomes is a major function of topo IV in vivo. Replication catenanes contain predominantly right-handed DNA crossings, although simulations of catenane conformations showed that left-handed crossings are often found within the loosely catenated substrates encountered in the cell (9Stone M.D. Bryant Z.
