https://openalex.org/W2767546280,"Minimizing losses at interfaces Among the issues facing the practical use of hybrid organohalide lead perovskite solar cells is the loss of charge carriers at interfaces. Hou et al. show that tantalum-doped tungsten oxide forms almost ohmic contacts with inexpensive conjugated polymer multilayers to create a hole-transporting material with a small interface barrier. This approach eliminates the use of ionic dopants that compromise device stability. Solar cells made with these contacts achieved maximum efficiencies of 21.2% and operated stably for more than 1000 hours. Science , this issue p. 1192"
https://openalex.org/W2767215064,"Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic crystal nucleation during the crystallization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride (Ge2Sb2Te5). Here, we demonstrate an alloying strategy to speed up the crystallization kinetics. The scandium antimony telluride (Sc0.2Sb2Te3) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast crystallization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize crystal precursors in the amorphous state. Controlling nucleation through alloy design paves the way for the development of cache-type PCRAM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems."

Herein we demonstrate that a photoredox-mediated hydrogen atom transfer protocol can efficiently and selectively install deuterium (D) and tritium (T) at α-amino sp3 carbon-hydrogen bonds in a single step, using isotopically labeled water (D2O or T2O) as the source of hydrogen isotope. In this context, we also report a convenient synthesis of T2O from T2, providing access to high-specific-activity T2O. This protocol has been successfully applied to the high incorporation of deuterium and tritium in 18 drug molecules, which meet the requirements for use in ligand-binding assays and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies."

Diets low in methionine increase longevity and overall health, particularly glucose homeostasis. Gu et al. describe a potential molecular link between the effects of methionine restriction and the growth controller mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), a well-validated regulator of life span and health span in many organisms. They identify a protein that they named SAMTOR as a component of the nutrient-sensing pathway upstream of mTORC1. SAMTOR directly binds S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a metabolite made from methionine, and is necessary for regulating mTORC1 in response to methionine. Science , this issue p. 813"

https://openalex.org/W2767817928,"Lewis acid catalysis tackled by tag team Molecular catalysts with two closely spaced nitrogen-hydrogen groups can act like a tweezer, activating a carbon center by latching onto a leaving group through double hydrogen bonding and then pulling it away. In the resultant ion pair, the shape of the catalyst can bias an ensuing reaction to favor just one of two possible mirror-image products. Banik et al. used this motif to activate a Lewis acid cocatalyst, pulling a leaving group off silicon instead of carbon (see the Perspective by Mattson). The combined pair of catalysts is more effective for reactions such as asymmetric cycloadditions that involve weaker leaving groups on carbon. Science , this issue p. 761 ; see also p. 720"

Somyajit et al. elucidate the cellular mechanisms that align replication fork dynamics with metabolic pathways (see the Perspective by Gómez-González and Aguilera). The elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels under metabolic stress dissociates a replication accelerator from the replisome and leads to replication slowdown, thus preventing replication stress. Studying this genome surveillance mechanism in cancer cells with elevated ROS levels and increased replication adaptability may provide opportunities to specifically target tumors.

https://openalex.org/W2768046970,"The Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) once covered an area comparable to that of Greenland. Previous geologic evidence and numerical models indicate that the ice sheet covered much of westernmost Canada as late as 12.5 thousand years ago (ka). New data indicate that substantial areas throughout westernmost Canada were ice free prior to 12.5 ka and some as early as 14.0 ka, with implications for climate dynamics and the timing of meltwater discharge to the Pacific and Arctic oceans. Early Bølling-Allerød warmth halved the mass of the CIS in as little as 500 years, causing 2.5 to 3.0 meters of sea-level rise. Dozens of cirque and valley glaciers, along with the southern margin of the CIS, advanced into recently deglaciated regions during the Bølling-Allerød and Younger Dryas."
https://openalex.org/W2767577579,"It has become increasingly clear that gut bacteria play vital roles in the development, nutrition, immunity, and overall fitness of their eukaryotic hosts. We conducted the present study to investigate the effects of gut microbiota disruption on the honey bee's immune responses to infection by the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae. Newly emerged adult workers were collected and divided into four groups: Group I-no treatment; Group II-inoculated with N. ceranae, Group III-antibiotic treatment, and Group IV-antibiotic treatment after inoculation with N. ceranae. Our study showed that Nosema infection did not cause obvious disruption of the gut bacterial community as there was no significant difference in the density and composition of gut bacteria between Group I and Group II. However, the elimination of gut bacteria by antibiotic (Groups III and IV) negatively impacted the functioning of the honey bees' immune system as evidenced by the expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides abaecin, defensin1, and hymenoptaecin that showed the following ranking: Group I > Group II > Group III > Group IV. In addition, significantly higher Nosema levels were observed in Group IV than in Group II, suggesting that eliminating gut bacteria weakened immune function and made honey bees more susceptible to Nosema infection. Based on Group IV having displayed the highest mortality rate among the four experimental groups indicates that antibiotic treatment in combination with stress, associated with Nosema infection, significantly and negatively impacts honey bee survival. The present study adds new evidence that antibiotic treatment not only leads to the complex problem of antibiotic resistance but can impact honey bee disease resistance. Further studies aimed at specific components of the gut bacterial community will provide new insights into the roles of specific bacteria and possibly new approaches to improving bee health."

As light propagates through a material, intuition might suggest that the more scatters there are, the shorter the path along which the light can propagate. Savo et al. confirm a recent theoretical proposal that predicts that this is not the case. They shone light through a series of samples of varying scatterer density and found that the average path length that the light traveled was independent of the sample microstructure. This finding should also be applicable to acoustics and matter waves. Science , this issue p. 765"
https://openalex.org/W2767869623,"The spread of invasive plants along elevational gradients is considered a threat to fragile mountain ecosystems, but it can also provide the opportunity to better understand some of the basic processes driving the success of invasive species. Ageratina adenophora (Asteraceae) is an invasive plant of global importance and has a broad distribution along elevational gradients in the Western Himalayas. Our study aimed at understanding the role of evolutionary processes (e.g. local adaptation and clinal differentiation) and different life history stages in shaping the distribution pattern of the invasive plant along an elevational gradient in the Western Himalaya. We carried out extensive distributional surveys, established a reciprocal transplant experiment with common gardens at three elevational levels, and measured a suite of traits related to germination, growth, reproduction and phenology. Our results showed a lack of local adaptation, and we did not find any evidence for clinal differentiation in any measured trait except a rather weak signal for plant height. We found that seed germination was the crucial life-cycle transition in determining the lower range limit while winter mortality of plants shaped the upper range limit in our study area, thus explaining the hump shaped distribution pattern. Differences in trait values between gardens for most traits indicated a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. Possible causes such as apomixis, seed dispersal among sites, and pre-adaptation might have confounded evolutionary processes to act upon. Our results suggest that the success and spread of Ageratina adenophora are dependent on different life history stages at different elevations that are controlled by abiotic conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2767587880,"The hepatitis A virus (HAV) is mainly transmitted through the faecal-oral route. In industrialized countries HAV infection generally occurs as either sporadic cases in travelers from endemic areas, local outbreak within closed/semi-closed population and as foodborne community outbreak. Recently, an increasing number of HAV infection clusters have been reported among young men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM). The Lazio Regional Service for the epidemiology and control for infectious diseases (SeRESMI) has noticed an increase of acute hepatitis A (AHA) since September 2016. Temporal analysis carried out with a discrete Poisson model using surveillance data between January 2016 and March 2017 evidenced an ongoing outbreak of AHA that started at the end of August. Molecular investigation carried out on 130 out of 513 cases AHA reported until March 2017 suggests that this outbreak is mainly supported by an HAV variant which is currently spreading within MSM communities across Europe (VRD_521_2016). The report confirms that AHA is an emerging issue among MSM. In addition through the integration of standard (case based) surveillance with molecular investigation we could discriminate, temporally concomitant but epidemiologically unrelated, clusters due to different HAV variants. As suggested by the WHO, in countries with low HAV circulation, vaccination programmes should be tailored on the local epidemiological patterns to prevent outbreaks among high risk groups and eventual spillover of the infection in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2767391062,"Biosurfactants are microbial metabolites with possible applications in various industrial sectors that are considered ecofriendly molecules. In recent years, some studies identified these compounds as alternatives for the elimination of vectors of tropical diseases, such as Aedes aegypti. The major bottlenecks of biosurfactant industrial production have been the use of conventional raw materials that increase production costs as well as opportunistic or pathogenic bacteria, which restrict the application of these biomolecules. The present study shows the potential of hemicellulosic sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate as a raw material for the production of a crystalline glycolipidic BS by Scheffersomyces stipitis NRRL Y-7124, which resulted in an emulsifying index (EI24) of 70 ± 3.4% and a superficial tension of 52 ± 2.9 mN.m-1. Additionally, a possible new application of these compounds as biolarvicides, mainly against A. aegypti, was evaluated. At a concentration of 800 mg.L-1, the produced biosurfactant caused destruction to the larval exoskeletons 12 h after application and presented an letal concentration (LC50) of 660 mg.L-1. Thus, a new alternative for biosurfactant production using vegetal biomass as raw material within the concept of biorefineries was proposed, and the potential of the crystalline glycolipidic biosurfactant in larvicidal formulations against neglected tropical disease vectors was demonstrated."

In this study, a total of 139,333 unigenes with average length of 1049 bp and N50 of 1579 bp are obtained by trinity assembly from Illumina sequencing reads. A total of 92,498 (66.38%) unigenes showed similarities in at least one database including Nr (46.15%), Nt (56.56%), KO (15.56%), Swiss-prot (33.34%), Pfam (33.43%), GO (33.62%) and KOG/COG (17.55%). Genes in flavonoid and taurine biosynthesis pathways were found and validated by RT-qPCR. A total of 50,093 EST-SSRs were identified from 38,922 unigenes, and 22,537 EST-SSR primer pairs were designed. Four hundred pairs of SSR markers were randomly selected to validate assembly quality, of which 352 (88%) were successful in PCR amplification of genomic DNA from 11 Lycium accessions and 210 produced polymorphisms. The polymorphic loci showed that the genetic similarity of the 11 Lycium accessions ranged from 0.50 to 0.99 and the accessions could be divided into 4 groups. These results will facilitate investigations of the molecular mechanism of formation of L. barbarum fruit and associated medicinal and nutritional components, and will be of value to novel gene discovery and functional genomic studies. The EST-SSR markers will be useful for genetic diversity evaluation, genetic mapping and marker-assisted breeding."

For decades C. trachomatis has been considered an “energy parasite” that relies entirely on the uptake of ATP from the host cell. The genomic data suggest that C. trachomatis respiratory chain could produce a sodium gradient that may sustain the energetic demands required for its rapid multiplication. However, this mechanism awaits experimental confirmation. Moreover, the relationship of chlamydiae with the host cell, in particular its energy dependence, is not well understood. In this work, we are showing that C. trachomatis has an active respiratory metabolism that seems to be coupled to the sodium-dependent synthesis of ATP. Moreover, our results show that the inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis at an early stage decreases the rate of infection and the chlamydial inclusion size. In contrast, the inhibition of the chlamydial respiratory chain at mid-stage of the infection cycle decreases the inclusion size but has no effect on infection rate. Remarkably, the addition of monensin, a Na+/H+ exchanger, completely halts the infection. Altogether, our data indicate that chlamydial development has a dynamic relationship with the mitochondrial metabolism of the host, in which the bacterium mostly depends on host ATP synthesis at an early stage, and at later stages it can sustain its own energy needs through the formation of a sodium gradient.

Here, we hypothesized that TSG-6 is essential for the development of HA- and ozone-induced AHR. TSG-6−/− and TSG-6+/+ mice were exposed to ozone or short-fragment HA (sHA), and AHR was assayed via flexiVent. The AHR response to sHA was evaluated in the isolated tracheal ring assay in tracheal rings from TSG-6−/− or TSG-6+/+, with or without the addition of exogenous TSG-6, and with or without inhibitors of Rho-associated, coiled-coil–containing protein kinase (ROCK), ERK, or PI3K. Smooth-muscle cells from mouse tracheas were assayed in vitro for signaling pathways. We found that TSG-6 deficiency protects against AHR after ozone (in vivo) or sHA (in vitro and in vivo) exposure. Moreover, TSG-6−/− tracheal ring non-responsiveness to sHA was reversed by exogenous TSG-6 addition. sHA rapidly activated RhoA, ERK, and Akt in airway smooth-muscle cells, but only in the presence of TSG-6.

In contrast, most cells undergoing elongated growth showed either a delayed gradual increase or pulsatile dynamics of Fus3 activity.

https://openalex.org/W2767653596,"Land-based activities, including deforestation, agriculture, and urbanisation, cause increased erosion, reduced inland and coastal water quality, and subsequent loss or degradation of downstream coastal marine ecosystems. Quantitative approaches to link sediment loads from catchments to metrics of downstream marine ecosystem state are required to calculate the cost effectiveness of taking conservation actions on land to benefits accrued in the ocean. Here we quantify the relationship between sediment loads derived from landscapes to habitat suitability of seagrass meadows in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. We use the following approach: (1) a catchment hydrological model generates sediment loads; (2) a statistical model links sediment loads to water clarity at monthly time-steps; (3) a species distribution model (SDM) factors in water clarity, bathymetry, wave height, and substrate suitability to predict seagrass habitat suitability at monthly time-steps; and (4) a statistical model quantifies the effect of sediment loads on area of seagrass suitable habitat in a given year. The relationship between sediment loads and seagrass suitable habitat is non-linear: large increases in sediment have a disproportionately large negative impact on availability of seagrass suitable habitat. Varying the temporal scale of analysis (monthly vs. yearly), or varying the threshold value used to delineate predicted seagrass presence vs. absence, both affect the magnitude, but not the overall shape, of the relationship between sediment loads and seagrass suitable habitat area. Quantifying the link between sediment produced from catchments and extent of downstream marine ecosystems allows assessment of the relative costs and benefits of taking conservation actions on land or in the ocean, respectively, to marine ecosystems."

However, the molecular mechanism by which BT-IgSF supports fertility is unclear. Here, we found that it is localized in Sertoli cells at the blood–testis barrier (BTB) and at the apical ectoplasmic specialization. The absence of BT-IgSF in Sertoli cells in both global and conditional mouse mutants (i.e. AMHCre and Rosa26CreERT2 lines) resulted in male infertility, atrophic testes with vacuolation, azoospermia, and spermatogenesis arrest. Although transcripts of junctional proteins such as connexin43, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin11 were up-regulated in the absence of BT-IgSF, the functional integrity of the BTB was impaired, as revealed by injection of a BTB-impermeable component into the testes under in vivo conditions. Disruption of the BTB coincided with mislocalization of connexin43, which was present throughout the seminiferous epithelium and not restricted to the BTB as in wild-type tissues, suggesting impaired cell–cell communication in the BT-IgSF–KO mice. Because EM images revealed a normal BTB structure between Sertoli cells in the BT-IgSF–KO mice, we conclude that infertility in these mice is most likely caused by a functionally impaired BTB.

The absence of BT-IgSF in Sertoli cells in both global and conditional mouse mutants (i.e. AMHCre and Rosa26CreERT2 lines) resulted in male infertility, atrophic testes with vacuolation, azoospermia, and spermatogenesis arrest. Although transcripts of junctional proteins such as connexin43, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin11 were up-regulated in the absence of BT-IgSF, the functional integrity of the BTB was impaired, as revealed by injection of a BTB-impermeable component into the testes under in vivo conditions. Disruption of the BTB coincided with mislocalization of connexin43, which was present throughout the seminiferous epithelium and not restricted to the BTB as in wild-type tissues, suggesting impaired cell–cell communication in the BT-IgSF–KO mice. Because EM images revealed a normal BTB structure between Sertoli cells in the BT-IgSF–KO mice, we conclude that infertility in these mice is most likely caused by a functionally impaired BTB. In summary, our results indicate that BT-IgSF is expressed at the BTB and is required for male fertility by supporting the functional integrity of the BTB. BT-IgSF (brain- and testis-specific Ig superfamily protein, also termed IgSF11) is a transmembrane Ig-like cell adhesion molecule (IgCAM) 2The abbreviations used are: IgCAMIg-like cell adhesion moleculeAMHanti-Müllerian hormoneBTBblood–testis barrierCARcoxsackievirus and adenovirus receptorCx43Connexin 43ESectoplasmic specializationWT1Wilms tumor 1ZO-1zona occludens-1KOMPKnock-Out Mouse ProjectH&Ehematoxylin and eosinqRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCRLHluteinizing hormonePFAparaformaldehyde. with a widespread tissue distribution that is preferentially expressed in brain and testis (1Suzu S.

BT-IgSF shares with coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule, and CLMP (CAR-like membrane protein) an identical overall domain organization with a membrane-distal V-type domain and a membrane-proximal C2-type domain (3Matthäus C.

BT-IgSF also contains a PDZ-binding motif at its C terminus to facilitate interactions with intracellular proteins including binding to PSD95 (6Jang S. Oh D. Lee Y. Hosy E. Shin H. van Riesen C.

In the mouse brain, BT-IgSF is highly expressed in the mature dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and knockdown experiments revealed that BT-IgSF is implicated in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission and plasticity (6Jang S.

Despite strong expression of BT-IgSF transcripts in the testes, its function here is currently not well understood. In seminiferi tubuli of the testes, cell–cell interactions and extensive restructuring of cell–cell contacts mediated by number of proteins including IgCAMs are indispensable for the sperm maturation and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. With the help of mouse genetics, we uncovered a role of BT-IgSF in the retention of the blood–testis barrier, which is formed by cell–cell junctions of the Sertoli cells including tight, adherens, and gapjunctions and desmosomes (for review see Refs. 8Mruk D.D.

Wong C.K. Cheng C.Y. Germ cell transport across the seminiferous epithelium during spermatogenesis.Physiology (Bethesda). 2014; 29: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Sertoli cells stretch from the basal site of the seminiferous epithelium to the lumen and divide the epithelium into two compartments. The BTB restricts blood contact to the basal side of the seminiferous epithelium and thereby protects meiotic germ cells and spermatids from autoimmune reactions and toxins. Alterations in the expression of proteins of the BTB, such as Claudin11, Occludin, ZO-2, and Cx43 can lead to severe defects in spermatogenesis, because deletion of these proteins causes infertility in mice (10Gow A.

Blood–testis barrier and spermatogenesis: lessons from genetically-modified mice.Asian J. Androl. 2014; 16: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cascade of sperm generation also requires the Sertoli cells as nursing cells by creating an intimate contact between Sertoli and germ cells, by providing a suitable environment for germ cell differentiation, and by establishing a hormonal balance (16França L.R. Hess R.A. Dufour J.M. Hofmann M.C. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli cell: one hundred fifty years of beauty and plasticity.Andrology. 2016; 4: 189-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Spermatogonial stem cells and premeiotic spermatogonia that are located in the basal part of the testes differentiate into preleptotene and leptotene spermatocytes, which transverse through the BTB to the adluminal part where meiosis and the spermiogenesis occurs. The process of cell movement requires a dynamic disassembly and assembly of cell–cell junctions between Sertoli cells and between Sertoli and germ cells. There is another important cell–cell contact site between Sertoli and germ cells called the apical ectoplasmic specialization (ES). The ES is a testis-specific actin-based anchoring junction complex, composed of adherens junctions, focal adhesion complex, and tight junction proteins (17Yan H.H. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Ectoplasmic specialization: a friend or a foe of spermatogenesis?.Bioessays. 2007; 29: 36-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The structure of the ES surrounds the head of spermatids and is the only anchor for developing elongating and elongated spermatids (18Cheng C.Y. Mruk D.D. A local autocrine axis in the testes that regulates spermatogenesis.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2010; 6: 380-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of the IgCAM BT-IgSF in the murine testes. We showed that the IgCAM BT-IgSF is a novel component of the BTB that is essential for its functional integrity. The loss of BT-IgSF leads to infertility because of azoospermia caused by an impaired function of the BTB despite the fact that ZO-1, Occludin, and Cx43 transcripts were found to be up-regulated. Most importantly, Cx43 is mislocalized in the seminiferi tubuli of BT-IgSF knockouts, suggesting a disturbed cell–cell communication. To study the localization of BT-IgSF in the testes, a polyclonal antibody to the extracellular region of mBT-IgSF was generated in rabbits. BT-IgSF was localized on the basal site of the seminiferi tubuli and associated with Sertoli cells close to its nucleus (Fig. 1, A and B, arrowheads). At the BTB, it co-localizes partly with connexin43 (Fig. 1E) and more extensively with ZO-1 (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, at the adluminal compartment at or around the acrosome of elongated spermatids (Fig. 1, A and B, arrows), co-localization with Espin was observed, indicating expression at the apical ectoplasmic specialization: an actin-based cell–cell anchoring junction (Fig. 1D). The localization on the sperm is further supported by the presence of BT-IgSF staining in the ductules of the epididymis (Fig. 1C). Even at higher magnifications (Fig. S2D), it remains unclear whether BT-IgSF protein is also expressed on germ cells because the thin cytoplasmic arms of Sertoli cells extend toward the lumen. To elucidate the role of BT-IgSF in the testis, we initially analyzed a non-conditional BT-IgSF knock-out mouse (Fig. S1). We observed that the testis size of BT-IgSF knock-out mice was significantly reduced compared with wild-type and heterozygous animals (Fig. 1, G and H), whereas other organs and the overall organization seem not to be affected. Breeding of BT-IgSF knock-out males to C57BL/6N wild-type females (five males with two females each) did not result in any offspring, although vaginal plugs were observed, indicating normal mating behavior but infertility. Heterozygous males and BT-IgSF knock-out females (nine females inspected) were fertile, suggesting that infertility is restricted to homozygous males. In H&E-stained sections, atrophic testes with vacuolar degeneration of the semininferi tubuli (Fig. 1I, asterisk) and Sertoli cell cytoplasmic extensions (Fig. 1I, arrowhead) were observed in BT-IgSF–deficient mice. Diameter of BT-IgSF knock-out tubuli were significantly smaller (158.22 ± 3.41 μm) compared with wild-type tubuli (212.39 ± 2.83 μm) (Fig. S2A). No sperms were detected in the lumen of homozygous knock-out animals (Fig. 1I, enlarged image for details, blue arrow). In contrast, multinucleated cells at the luminal site were found (Fig. 1I, arrow). Analysis of testis preparations, stained for DNA with DAPI, by flow cytometry showed that BT-IgSF–deficient testes lacked haploid cells with 1C DNA content (Fig. 1J). This observation further demonstrated that loss of BT-IgSF leads to azoospermia. The lack of haploid cells in the seminiferi tubuli indicates an arrest in spermatogenesis and a disturbance of meiosis. To determine the exact stage of arrest, expression of genes transcribed during spermatogenesis were measured by qRT-PCR (19Lee J.H. Engel W. Nayernia K.

Expression profile of male germ cell-associated genes in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures treated with all-trans retinoic acid and testosterone.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2009; 76: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The expression of Piwil2 did not significantly differ between wild-type and BT-IgSF knock-out mice (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the number of stem cells are not changed in abundance. A slight tendency toward an increased stem cell amount in the knock-out was detected. However, the transcripts for germ cells in the mid-pachytene stage and late pachytene stages, HoxA4 and Cdc25c, respectively, were significantly reduced. In contrast, marker for the overall pachytene stage (Sycp3) and for meiotic cells in general (Dazl) were up-regulated, suggesting an increased cell number between the stem cell stage and the mid-pachytene stage. Transcripts for postmeiotic markers (Akap4 and Prm1), which are only expressed in haploid spermatids, were not detected at all in knock-out testes. These expression data also indicated a complete lack of spermatids and sperms. Next, we investigated whether the changes in gene expression have an impact on meiosis I. Arrest in meiosis I is often caused by failed pairing of homologous chromosomes. To examine whether this pairing works out properly in BT-IgSF KO males, stainings with antibodies against SYCP3 or γH2AX were performed on testis sections. SYCP3 is a marker for the axial element of the synaptonemal complex from zygotene to pachytene stage during meiosis I, and phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) is expressed from leptotene on and later marks the silenced sex body (meiotic sex chromosome inactivation) (22Handel M.A. The XY body: a specialized meiotic chromatin domain.Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23Lammers J.H. Offenberg H.H. van Aalderen M. Vink A.C. Dietrich A.J. Heyting C.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Wild-type and knock-out testis show SYCP3 expression, although in slightly different patterns, which can be attributed to the disturbed testis morphology in BT-IgSF–deficient mice. In both genotypes γH2AX was co-expressed with SYCP3 at early pachytene, indicated by diffuse distribution (Fig. 2B, arrows), as well as late pachytene, implied by a restricted expression at the inactivated X-chromosome (Fig. 2B, arrowheads). In the knock-out testes, all meiotic cells expressed γH2AX, indicating that all of these cells are in meiosis I. In meiosis II, which represents a mitosis, γH2AX is normally not expressed (Fig. S2E). Therefore, these results show that in BT-IgSF–deficient germ cells, meiosis I appears to be properly carried out and that the spermatogenic arrest most likely occurs after meiosis I. To assess implications of BT-IgSF absence on Sertoli cells, we analyzed the localization of intermediate filament vimentin in testis sections, which showed irregular and disturbed cytoplasmic arms of Sertoli cells in BT-IgSF knock-out mice (Fig. 3A). However, the localization and the number of Sertoli cells, as detected by nuclear staining with Wilms tumor 1 (WT1), appears not to be affected (Fig. 3B). Analysis of cell death by an antibody against active caspase-3 revealed a slight increase of positive cells in BT-IgSF knock-out, which, however, did not reach statistical significance. On the basis of their localization inside the tubuli and the presence of cytoplasmic arms, apoptotic cells in knock-out testes were considered as Sertoli cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Azoospermia caused by Sertoli cells might affect the hormonal hypothalamic–pituitary axis in BT-IgSF–deficient males. Therefore, the level of the luteinizing hormone (LH), the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone in the blood of wild-type and BT-IgSF knock-out mice were measured by an ELISA–based technique. No significant differences in LH, FSH, and testosterone between genotypes were detected (Fig. 3E). Differences in the LH levels between knock-out individuals are probably due to episodically discontinuous pulses of LH, which have been previously described (24Coquelin A. Desjardins C. Luteinizing hormone and testosterone secretion in young and old male mice.Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: E257-E263PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that a disturbed hormonal balance does not contribute to male infertility in BT-IgSF–deficient mice. The expression and its subcellular localization of BT-IgSF in Sertoli cells prompted us to analyze BTB integrity in BT-IgSF knock-out mice by injecting EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, which is BTB–impermeable, into the testis in an in vivo situation (25Meng J. Holdcraft R.W. Shima J.E. Griswold M.D. Braun R.E. Androgens regulate the permeability of the blood–testis barrier.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16696-16700Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The injected EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin was visualized after fixation with streptavidin-coupled Cy5 in cryostat sections. In wild-type testis, biotin staining outlined the basal spermatogonia but was not detectable in other cell layers (Fig. 4A). In contrast, in BT-IgSF KO testis, the biotin signal was less sharp in the basal compartment and was additionally detected in other cell layers, indicating a disruption of the BTB. The BTB consists of several cell–cell contact proteins forming tight junctions, gap junctions, and adherens junctions (for review see Refs. 9Xiao X. Mruk D.D. Wong C.K. Cheng C.Y. Germ cell transport across the seminiferous epithelium during spermatogenesis.Physiology (Bethesda). 2014; 29: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and 26Cheng C.Y. Mruk D.D. The blood–testis barrier and its implications for male contraception.Pharmacol. Rev. 2012; 64: 16-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the expression of mRNAs of proteins involved in the BTB by qRT-PCR and observed striking differences between wild-type and BT-IgSF knock-out testes. The tight junction transcripts Cldn11, Occludin, and ZO-1 were significantly up-regulated in knock-out testes (Fig. 4B). In immunofluorescence stainings of testis sections, ZO-1 protein appears slightly enhanced, and its localization appears less organized at the BTB in comparison with wild-type (Fig. 4E). Similarly to the tight junction proteins, the mRNA of Cx43, the most abundantly expressed gap junctional protein in testes, is also up-regulated in BT-IgSF knock-out testes (Fig. 4B). This increase was also clearly detected in immunofluorescence stainings. Moreover and most interestingly, Cx43 was found to localize throughout the knock-out tubule and not to be restricted to the BTB, whereas in the wild-type Cx43 is sharply located at the basal site of the seminiferi tubuli at the BTB (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, the phosphorylation status of Cx43 was increased in BT-IgSF–deficient testes (Fig. 4, C and D), although with some variabilities. In electron microscopy of testis sections, vacuolation (Fig. 4G, red outlines), as well as the lack of sperm and a disorganization of the epithelium, was detected in BT-IgSF knockouts. However, no differences in the ultrastructure of the BTB of wild-type and knock-out testis was detected at this level (Fig. 4G, arrowheads); all sections showed intact BTB structures including “new” and “old” BTBs behind and ahead of the pachytene spermatocytes, respectively, suggesting that BTB formation can occur in the absence of BT-IgSF but that its functionality is disturbed (Fig. S2G). To further substantiate that BT-IgSF expression in Sertoli cells is needed for proper testis morphology and fertility, we inactivated BT-IgSF by crossing a floxed BT-IgSF allele to AMHCre to specifically knock-out the BT-IgSF gene in Sertoli cells only. In BT-IgSFflx/flx, AMHCre males the exact same phenotype as in the global knock-out was observed. The animals showed reduced testis weight (Fig. 5A), together with atrophic morphology in seminiferous tubules (Fig. 5B) and azoospermia (Fig. 5D). Knock-out of BT-IgSF in Sertoli cells was proven by immunofluorescence stainings with antibodies to BT-IgSF (Fig. 5C, arrowheads). Interestingly, the stainings showed minimal residual BT-IgSF expression, but not in Sertoli cells. The results of the AMH-conditional knock-out support that the expression of BT-IgSF in Sertoli cells is essential for male fertility. To exclude overall developmental defects on the absence of BT-IgSF, we developed a conditional knock-out in which BT-IgSF can be depleted at any chosen stage by the administration of tamoxifen (BT-IgSFflx/flx; Rosa26CreERT2). Inactivation of BT-IgSF in sexually mature males (8–12 weeks old) by tamoxifen treatment at 5 consecutive days resulted in a testis weight that was significantly lower compared with vehicle treated animals (Fig. 6B). In histological sections, vehicle-treated animals had normal testis morphology (Fig. 6A), whereas tamoxifen-treated animals showed testis with seminiferi tubuli resembling the morphology of BT-IgSF from non-conditional knockouts. They showed vacuolation, the lack of sperms and cytoplasmic extension of Sertoli cells (Fig. 6A). However, a number of normal seminiferi tubuli were also detected. Consistently, by flow cytometry we detected significantly less 1C (haploid, 23 chromatids) cells in tamoxifen-treated animals than in vehicle-treated controls. We measured a higher percentage of cells with 2C (haploid, 23 chromosomes) and 4C (diploid, 46 chromosomes), suggesting that more cells enter meiosis (Fig. 6, C and D). The analysis of knock-out efficiency by qRT-PCR showed that the BT-IgSF at the mRNA level expression was reduced by ∼50%, which is obviously not sufficient to maintain proper spermatogenesis (Fig. 6E). In these conditional mutants Cx43 expression was up-regulated as observed in the non-conditional knock-out, which again was accompanied with localization throughout the tubule. The reduced expression of Prm1 again confirms the reduction of sperms (Fig. 6E, right panel). Spermatogenesis depends on intensive cross-talks between germ and Sertoli cells and intact cell–cell contacts. The disturbance of such cell junctions through the impairment of cell–cell adhesion disrupts the BTB and leads to infertility. One paradigmatic group of cell adhesion proteins expressed in the testis is the CAR subgroup of IgCAMs comprising CAR, CLMP, and BT-IgSF (27Sze K.-L. Lee W.M. Lui W.-Y. Expression of CLMP, a novel tight junction protein, is mediated via the interaction of GATA with the Kruppel family proteins, KLF4 and Sp1, in mouse TM4 Sertoli cells.J. Cell.

However, neither CAR nor CLMP have been found to be crucial for maintaining the integrity of the BTB or for male fertility (27Sze K.-L. Lee W.M. Lui W.-Y. Expression of CLMP, a novel tight junction protein, is mediated via the interaction of GATA with the Kruppel family proteins, KLF4 and Sp1, in mouse TM4 Sertoli cells.J. Cell.

Mice depleted of CAR display normal spermatogenesis and an intact blood–testis Barrier.Reproduction. 2014; 147: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), although CAR interacts with JAM-C, which is crucial for fertility (30Gliki G. Ebnet K. Aurrand-Lions M. Imhof B.A. Adams R.H. Spermatid differentiation requires the assembly of a cell polarity complex downstream of junctional adhesion molecule-C.Nature. 2004; 431: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that another member of the CAR subgroup, BT-IgSF, is also expressed at the BTB close to the Sertoli cell nucleus. The expression of BT-IgSF in Sertoli cells was further confirmed by a Sertoli-specific (AMHCre) knock-out of BT-IgSF. AMH is only expressed in fetal Sertoli cells in males, enabling a Sertoli cell specific knock-out of BT-IgSF (31Lécureuil C. Fontaine I. Crepieux P. Guillou F. Sertoli and granulosa cell-specific Cre recombinase activity in transgenic mice.Genesis. 2002; 33: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a co-localization of BT-IgSF with Espin, a marker for the ES, was observed. Stainings with antibodies against BT-IgSF showed signals at the basal side at Sertoli cells but also at the membrane of cells located at the adluminal side. Whether this labeling is restricted to the cytoplasmic arms of Sertoli cells stretching to the lumen or is located at the membrane of germ cells cannot be definitely decided. However, there is strong evidence that BT-IgSF functions primarily in Sertoli cells. The BT-IgSF expression is strongest at the basal side at Sertoli cells. In the absence of BT-IgSF, we observed defects in the BTB, which is in vivo only constituted of cell junctions between Sertoli–Sertoli cells and not between Sertoli–germ cells or germ–germ cells (32Mruk D.D. Cheng C.Y. The mammalian blood–testis barrier: its biology and regulation.Endocr. Rev. 2015; 36: 564-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Sertoli cell–specific knock-out of BT-IgSF shows exact the same phenotype as in the global knock-out, leading to our conclusion that BT-IgSF is mainly important for proper Sertoli cell function. Whether BT-IgSF is also on germ cells might be determined by immunolabeled electron microscopy, for which, however, appropriate antibodies are currently not available. Loss of BT-IgSF leads to atrophic testes, an arrest of spermatogenesis and male infertility. The testis size of BT-IgSF knock-o"
https://openalex.org/W2767752418,"In China, the basic insurance system consists of three schemes: the UEBMI (Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance), URBMI (Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance), and NCMS (New Cooperative Medical Scheme), across which significant differences have been observed. Since 2009, the central government has been experimenting with consolidating these schemes in selected areas. This study examines whether differences still exist across schemes after the consolidation.A survey was conducted in the city of Suzhou, collecting data on subjects 45 years old and above with at least one inpatient or outpatient treatment during a period of twelve months. Analysis on 583 subjects was performed comparing subjects' characteristics across insurance schemes. A resampling-based method was applied to compute the predicted gross medical cost, OOP (out-of-pocket) cost, and insurance reimbursement rate.Subjects under different insurance schemes differ in multiple aspects. For inpatient treatments, subjects under the URBMI have the highest observed and predicted gross and OOP costs, while those under the UEBMI have the lowest. For outpatient treatments, subjects under the UEBMI and URBMI have comparable costs, while those under the NCMS have much lower costs.

https://openalex.org/W2767800575,"Although it is widely appreciated that the use of global translation inhibitors, such as cycloheximide, in protein degradation assays may result in artefacts, these inhibitors continue to be employed, owing to the absence of robust alternatives. We describe here the promoter reference technique (PRT), an assay for protein degradation with two advantageous features: a reference protein and a gene-specific inhibition of translation. In PRT assays, one measures, during a chase, the ratio of a test protein to a long-lived reference protein, a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The test protein and DHFR are coexpressed, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, on a low-copy plasmid from two identical PTDH3 promoters containing additional, previously developed DNA elements. Once transcribed, these elements form 5′-RNA aptamers that bind to the added tetracycline, which represses translation of aptamer-containing mRNAs. The selectivity of repression avoids a global inhibition of translation. This selectivity is particularly important if a component of a relevant proteolytic pathway (e.g. a specific ubiquitin ligase) is itself short-lived. We applied PRT to the Pro/N-end rule pathway, whose substrates include the short-lived Mdh2 malate dehydrogenase. Mdh2 is targeted for degradation by the Gid4 subunit of the GID ubiquitin ligase. Gid4 is also a metabolically unstable protein. Through analyses of short-lived Mdh2 as a target of short-lived Gid4, we illustrate the advantages of PRT over degradation assays that lack a reference and/or involve cycloheximide. In sum, PRT avoids the use of global translation inhibitors during a chase and also provides a “built-in” reference protein.

The rates of subsequent degradation of the resulting protein fragments can be quite dissimilar. The in vivo destruction of a protein usually involves either its polyubiquitylation, followed by the proteasome-mediated degradation, or the entrapment of a protein in an autophagosome, followed by the lysosome-mediated proteolysis. Some proteins can be targeted through both of these routes concurrently, depending on the nature of a protein, its degron(s), and the physiological state of a cell (31Cha-Molstad H. Yu J.E. Feng Z.

One class of widely employed approaches, historically among the first to be introduced, are assays for in vivo protein degradation that involve the use of a global translation inhibitor to halt protein synthesis, followed by measurements of decreasing levels of a protein of interest (a “chase”) by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting or by other means. The resulting decay curves are usually calibrated by measuring, in parallel, the levels of an abundant endogenous protein (e.g. tubulin or actin) that is presumed to be both long-lived and expressed at approximately equal levels under different physiological conditions and in varying genetic backgrounds. A shortcoming, in the context of these assays, of a global translation inhibitor such as, for example, cycloheximide (CHX), 3The abbreviations used are: CHXcycloheximideDHFRdihydrofolate reductasePRTpromoter reference techniqueTctetracyclineUbubiquitinSCsynthetic complete. is not only the inhibitor’s cytotoxicity but also the fact that a proteolytic pathway under study may itself involve a short-lived protein(s).

In all such cases, a global halt to the synthesis of cellular proteins would perturb the very process that a degradation assay is meant to measure, because the activity of a relevant proteolytic pathway would start to decrease as soon as its short-lived component is no longer produced.

Structural basis of an N-degron adaptor with more stringent specificity.Structure. 2016; 24: 232-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The main determinant of an N-degron is a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein. Initially, most N-degrons are pro-N-degrons. They are converted to active N-degrons either constitutively (e.g. during the emergence of a nascent protein from a ribosome) or conditionally, via regulated steps. A pro-N-degron can become an N-degron through a site-specific cleavage of a protein by a protease and/or through enzymatic acetylation, formylation, arginylation, or leucylation of specific proteins at the α-amino group of their N-terminal residues. Studies over the last 3 decades have shown that all 20 amino acids of the genetic code can act, in cognate sequence contexts, as destabilizing N-terminal residues (Fig. S1). Consequently, many, possibly most, proteins in a cell are conditionally short-lived N-end rule substrates, either as full-length proteins or as protease-generated natural protein fragments (54Chen S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2767975443,"The pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) is a xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor that modulates the metabolic response to drugs and toxic agents. Both PXR activation and deficiency promote hepatic triglyceride accumulation, a hallmark feature of alcoholic liver disease. However, the molecular mechanism of PXR-mediated activation of ethanol (EtOH)-induced steatosis is unclear. Here, using male wildtype (WT) and Pxr-null mice, we examined PXR-mediated regulation of chronic EtOH-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and hepatotoxicity. EtOH ingestion for 8 weeks significantly (1.8-fold) up-regulated Pxr mRNA levels in WT mice. The EtOH exposure also increased mRNAs encoding hepatic constitutive androstane receptor (3-fold) and its target, Cyp2b10 (220-fold), in a PXR-dependent manner. Furthermore, WT mice had higher serum EtOH levels and developed hepatic steatosis characterized by micro- and macrovesicular lipid accumulation. Consistent with the development of steatosis, lipogenic gene induction was significantly increased in WT mice, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c target gene fatty-acid synthase (3.0-fold), early growth response-1 (3.2-fold), and TNFα (3.0-fold), whereas the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α target genes was suppressed. Of note, PXR deficiency suppressed these changes and steatosis. Protein levels, but not mRNAs levels, of EtOH-metabolizing enzymes, including alcohol dehydrogenase 1, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1, and catalase, as well as the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, involved in regulating lipid output were higher in Pxr-null than in WT mice. These findings establish that PXR signaling contributes to ALD development and suggest that PXR antagonists may provide a new approach for ALD therapy."

D8 is also a target for neutralizing antibody responses that are elicited by the smallpox vaccine, which has enabled the first eradication of a human viral pathogen and is a useful model for studying antibody responses. However, to date, VACV epitopes targeted by human antibodies have not been characterized at atomic resolution. Here, we characterized the binding properties of several human anti-D8 antibodies and determined the crystal structures of three VACV-mAb variants, VACV-66, VACV-138, and VACV-304, separately bound to D8. Although all these antibodies bound D8 with high affinity and were moderately neutralizing in the presence of complement, VACV-138 and VACV-304 also fully blocked D8 binding to CS-A, the low affinity ligand for D8. VACV-138 also abrogated D8 binding to the high-affinity ligand CS-E, but we observed residual CS-E binding was observed in the presence of VACV-304. Analysis of the VACV-138– and VACV-304–binding sites along the CS-binding crevice of D8, combined with different efficiencies of blocking D8 adhesion to CS-A and CS-E allowed us to propose that D8 has a high- and low-affinity CS-binding region within its central crevice. The crevice is amenable to protein engineering to further enhance both specificity and affinity of binding to CS-E. Finally, a wild-type D8 tetramer specifically bound to structures within the developing glomeruli of the kidney, which express CS-E. We propose that through structure-based protein engineering, an improved D8 tetramer could be used as a potential diagnostic tool to detect expression of CS-E, which is a possible biomarker for ovarian cancer.

The absence in mammals of some DEG/ENaCs subfamily orthologues such as FMRFamide peptide–activated sodium channels (FaNaCs), which have been identified only in mollusks, indicates that the various subfamilies diverged early in evolution. We recently reported that the nonproton agonist 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ) activates acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), a DEG/ENaC subfamily mainly in mammals, in the absence of acidosis. Here, we show that GMQ also could directly activate the mollusk-specific FaNaCs. Differences in ion selectivity and unitary conductance and effects of substitutions at key residues revealed that GMQ and FMRFamide activate FaNaCs via distinct mechanisms. The presence of two activation mechanisms in the FaNaC subfamily diverging early in the evolution of DEG/ENaCs suggested that dual gating is an ancient feature in this superfamily. Notably, the GMQ-gating mode is still preserved in the mammalian ASIC subfamily, whereas FMRFamide-mediated channel gating was lost during evolution. This implied that GMQ activation may be essential for the functions of mammalian DEG/ENaCs.

The identification of the synthetic activator of ENaC, S3969, also brings new opportunities for therapeutic development, such as treatment of false aldosterone deficiency (24Lu M. Echeverri F.

Therefore, more in-depth studies into polymodal gating mechanisms of the DEG/ENaC channels have important implications in both basic research and disease intervention. Here, we demonstrated that GMQ, a previously described nonproton ligand of ASIC3, can activate all four FaNaC orthologues via a mechanism distinct from the native FMRFamide peptide (35Niu Y.Y. Yang Y. Liu Y. Huang L.D. Yang X.N. Fan Y.Z. Cheng X.Y. Cao P. Hu Y.M. Li L. Lu X.Y. Tian Y. Yu Y.

Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. A nonproton ligand sensor in the acid-sensing ion channel.Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Our data not only indicate a closer evolutionary relationship between ASIC and FaNaC subfamilies, despite the low sequence homology (12–18%), but also a conservation of the “GMQ-activation mode” that was already present in the common ancestor of these two subfamilies. In addition, two distinct activation modes of FaNaCs also reflect that the dual gating may already exist in the ancestor of DEG/ENaC superfamily of ion channels. Previously, we identified GMQ as the first nonproton ligand of ASICs (Fig. 2A), which selectively activates ASIC3 but not ASIC1a, -1b, and -2a (27Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. A nonproton ligand sensor in the acid-sensing ion channel.Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Others, however, argued that the GMQ worked by altering pH dependence and steady-state inactivation of ASIC1a, -1b, -2a, and -3 differentially, and such shifts only allowed ASIC3 activation at the physiological pH 7.4 (36Alijevic O. Kellenberger S. Subtype-specific modulation of acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) function by 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 36059-36070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To look for further evidence that GMQ acts as a direct agonist rather a modulator, we examined its ability to activate other DEG/ENaC subfamily members not known to be activated by extracellular protons. We tested FaNaCs because their native agonist, FMRFamide, has been shown to augment the sustained currents of ASIC3 and ASIC1a (37Askwith C.C. Cheng C. Ikuma M. Benson C. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Neuropeptide FF and FMRFamide potentiate acid-evoked currents from sensory neurons and proton-gated DEG/ENaC channels.Neuron. 2000; 26: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GMQ directly activated all four FaNaC orthologues expressed in CHO cells (Fig. 2B), and there is no GMQ current observed in cells without FaNaC expression (Fig. 2B). GMQ-evoked currents in all FaNaCs are sensitive to amiloride (Fig. 2B), which is a common feature of DEG/ENaC superfamily of ion channels (1Kellenberger S. Schild L. Epithelial sodium channel/degenerin family of ion channels: A variety of functions for a shared structure.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). GMQ also evoked amiloride-sensitive currents in Xenopus oocytes that were injected with HaFaNaC cRNA (see below), suggesting that the stimulatory effect of GMQ is independent of the host cell types. ASIC3 can be directly activated by deprivation of extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o) (Fig. 2A) (27Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L.

Friend V. Lingueglia E. Deval E. Human ASIC3 channel dynamically adapts its activity to sense the extracellular pH in both acidic and alkaline directions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 13124-13129Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, neither Ca2+o deprivation (Fig. 2C), nor high (pH 9.0)/low (pH 5.0) pH (Fig. 2, D–F) activated those four FaNaC orthologues. A small endogenous response to pH 5.0 was observed in all cells (Fig. 2E), and it was not inhibited by amiloride (Fig. 2, E and F). Thus, it is unlikely that GMQ acted on FaNaCs through modulation of any intrinsic activation or inhibition of this DEG/ENaC subfamily by pH or Ca2+o. Furthermore, GMQ evoked amiloride-sensitive currents in Xenopus oocytes with HaFaNaC cRNA injection (Fig. 3, A and B), but caused only a slight inhibition of the spontaneous activity of human ENaCαβγ expressed (Fig. 3C). Thus, the agonistic effects of GMQ on FaNaCs and ASIC3 are specific, rather than universal, among the DEG/ENaC family of ion channels, which could imply a close evolutionary relationship between FaNaCs and ASICs. We recently identified the key sites essential for FMRFamide-mediated activation of HaFaNaC (35Niu Y.Y. Yang Y. Liu Y. Huang L.D. Yang X.N. Fan Y.Z. Cheng X.Y. Cao P. Hu Y.M. Li L. Lu X.Y. Tian Y.

Chem. 2016; 291: 7571-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), here we continue using HaFaNaC as a representative to examine the mechanism by which GMQ activates FaNaCs, and compared it with GMQ’s action on ASIC3. Previously, we have showed that GMQ could activate rat ASIC3 (rASIC3) at millimolar level (EC50 = 1.27 ± 0.13 mm) under normal physiological conditions (pH 7.4 and 2 mm Ca2+o) (27Yu Y. Chen Z.

A nonproton ligand sensor in the acid-sensing ion channel.Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Decrease or deprivation of Ca2+o significantly increased its apparent affinity by ∼20-fold (EC50 = 0.06 ± 0.01 mm, Ca2+-free) (27Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. A nonproton ligand sensor in the acid-sensing ion channel.Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, GMQ also exhibited an increased potency on rASIC3 in mild acidosis (pH 7.0–6.9), whereas acidic (pH 6.5–5.0) or basic (pH 8.0–9.0) pH attenuated the GMQ-induced activation (27Yu Y. Chen Z. Li W.G. Cao H. Feng E.G. Yu F. Liu H. Jiang H. Xu T.L. A nonproton ligand sensor in the acid-sensing ion channel.Neuron. 2010; 68: 61-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Similarly, GMQ activated HaFaNaC at millimolar level (EC50 = 3.45 ± 0.24 mm, 2 mm Ca2+, pH 7.4) (Fig. 4A); depletion of Ca2+o also left shifted the GMQ’s dose-response curve in HaFaNaC, but with a relative lower potentiation in efficacy when compared with rASIC3 (∼5-fold enhancement, EC50 = 0.8 ± 0.04 mm, Ca2+-free, pH 7.4) (Fig. 4A). Deprivation of Ca2+o also increased the GMQ’s action on three other FaNaC orthologues (Fig. 2B), suggesting this is a common feature in the FaNaC subfamily. Although acidification (pH 5.0–6.0) inhibited the GMQ’s action in HaFaNaC (Fig. 5A), just like what it does on rASIC3 (26Yu Y. Li W.G. Chen Z. Cao H. Yang H. Jiang H. Xu T.L.

Monocytes as specific effector cells of the innate immunity play a crucial role in inflammation. Using their Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), notably Toll-Like Receptors (TLR), the monocytes recognize pathogens and/or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and organize their clearance. TLR2 is the major receptor for particles of gram-positive bacteria, and initiates their phagocytosis. Here, we investigated the phagocytizing capability of monocytes in a long-term porcine severe trauma model (polytrauma, PT) with regard to their TLR2 expression. Polytrauma consisted of femur fracture, unilateral lung contusion, liver laceration, hemorrhagic shock with subsequent resuscitation and surgical fracture fixation. After induction of PT, peripheral blood was withdrawn before (-1 h) and directly after trauma (0 h), as well as 3.5 h, 5.5 h, 24 h and 72 h later. CD14+ monocytes were identified and the expression levels of H(S)LA-DR and TLR2 were investigated by flow cytometry. Additionally, the phagocytizing activity of monocytes by applying S. aureus particles labelled with pHrodo fluorescent reagent was also assessed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, blood samples from 10 healthy pigs were exposed to a TLR2-neutralizing antibody and subsequently to S. aureus particles. Using flow cytometry, phagocytizing activity was determined. P below 0.05 was considered significant. The number of CD14+ monocytes of all circulating leukocytes remained constant during the observational time period, while the percentage of CD14+H(S)LA-DR+ monocytes significantly decreased directly, 3.5 h and 5.5 h after trauma. The percentage of TLR2+ expressing cells out of all monocytes significantly decreased directly, 3.5 h and 5.5 h after trauma. The percentage of phagocytizing monocytes decreased immediately and remained lower during the first 3.5 h after trauma, but increased after 24 h. Antagonizing TLR2 significantly decreased the phagocytizing activity of monocytes. Both, decreased percentage of activated as well as TLR2 expressing monocytes persisted as long as the reduced phagocytosis was observed. Moreover, neutralizing TLR2 led to a reduced capability of phagocytosis as well. Therefore, we assume that reduced TLR2 expression may be responsible for the decreased phagocytizing capacity of circulating monocytes in the early post-traumatic phase."

In this work, a systematic study of pool boiling heat transfer on smooth surfaces of varying wettability (contact angle range of 5° − 180°) has been conducted and reported. Based on numerical simulations, boiling curves are calculated and boiling dynamics in each regime are studied using a volume-of-fluid method with contact angle model. The calculated trends in critical heat flux and Leidenfrost point as functions of surface wettability are obtained and compared with prior experimental and theoretical predictions, giving good agreement. For the first time, the effect of contact angle on the complete boiling curve is shown. It is demonstrated that the simulation methodology can be used for studying pool boiling and related dynamics and providing more physical insights."

The purpose of this study was to characterize the whole genome DNA methylation profile in children with precursor B-cell ALL (BCP ALL) and to compare this profile with methylation observed in normal bone marrow samples. Additional efforts were made to correlate the observed methylation patterns with selected clinical features. We assessed DNA methylation from bone marrow samples obtained from 38 children with BCP ALL at the time of diagnosis along with 4 samples of normal bone marrow cells as controls using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Array. Patients were diagnosed and stratified into prognosis groups according to the BFM ALL IC 2009 protocol. The analysis of differentially methylated sites across the genome as well as promoter methylation profiles allowed clear separation of the leukemic and control samples into two clusters. 86.6% of the promoter-associated differentially methylated sites were hypermethylated in BCP ALL. Seven sites were found to correlate with the BFM ALL IC 2009 high risk group. Amongst these, one was located within the gene body of the MBP gene and another was within the promoter region- PSMF1 gene. Differentially methylated sites that were significantly related with subsets of patients with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion and hyperdiploidy. The analyzed translocations and change of genes' sequence context does not affect methylation and methylation seems not to be a mechanism for the regulation of expression of the resulting fusion genes."

Interestingly, two functions of the MDM2 RING domain, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and MDMX binding, have been found to be independently dispensable in unstressed adult mice (15Tollini L.A. Jin A. Park J. Zhang Y. Regulation of p53 by Mdm2 E3 ligase function is dispensable in embryogenesis and development, but essential in response to DNA damage.Cancer Cell. 2014; 26: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Pant V.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11995-12000Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of RING domain toward the regulation of physiological p53 transcriptional activity in the adult mouse still remains inadequately understood. In this study we sought to address the following questions: 1) Does the MDM2 RING domain function to regulate p53 transcriptional activity in adult mice? 2) Is MDM2–p53 binding sufficient for p53 regulation and adult organismal survival? 3) In the absence of MDM2 or MDM2 RING domain function, does MDMX play a role in regulating p53 transcriptional activity in adult mice? To study the role of the MDM2 RING domain in vivo, we crossed mice bearing a single residue substitution in the MDM2 RING domain (Mdm2C462A/C462A) that abolishes several key RING domain functions, including MDM2 E3 ligase activity and MDM2–MDMX binding. Because Mdm2C462A/C462A single-residue substitution results in the embryonic lethality, we substituted endogenous p53 with p53ER/−, an inactive p53 estrogen receptor fusion allele, which allows for tamoxifen mediated p53 functional restoration (20Christophorou M.A. Martin-Zanca D. Soucek L. Lawlor E.R. Brown-Swigart L. Verschuren E.W. Evan G.I. Temporal dissection of p53 function in vitro and in vivo.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). At the same time, we generated Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− and Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− as control groups to define the function of the MDM2 RING domain on regulation of physiological p53. Strikingly, following p53ER functional restoration, mice bearing the MDM2C462A mutation die earlier than mice bearing MDM2 deletion, and this early lethality correlates with increased p53 activity. These results provide evidence to suggest that loss of MDM2 RING domain function through MDM2C462A mutation stimulates spontaneous p53 activation beyond what occurs when MDM2 is deleted. In vitro, MDM2 has been shown to modulate p53 transcriptional activity by direct inhibitory binding to the p53 transactivation domain (21Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J.

Structure of the MDM2 oncoprotein bound to the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain.Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). The RING domain of MDM2, which is important for MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation and MDM2–MDMX heterodimer formation, is also critical for p53 regulation in vivo. Several studies using mouse models have suggested that each of these RING domain functions are important to p53 regulation during embryogenesis; however, MDM2–MDMX binding and MDM2 E3 ligase activity have been shown to be independently dispensable in the adult mouse (14Itahana K.

To confirm whether MDM2 retains p53 inhibitory capabilities in the absence of either of the canonical MDM2 RING domain functions in adult mice, we utilized mice bearing the MDM2C462A mutation (Mdm2C462A/C462A), which disrupts both MDM2–MDMX binding and MDM2 E3 ligase function. Because Mdm2C462A/C462A mice exhibit p53-dependent embryonic lethality (14Itahana K. Mao H. Jin A. Itahana Y. Clegg H.V. Lindström M.S. Bhat K.P. Godfrey V.L. Evan G.I. Zhang Y.

Soucek L. Lawlor E.R. Brown-Swigart L. Verschuren E.W. Evan G.I. Temporal dissection of p53 function in vitro and in vivo.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We crossed Mdm2C462A/C462A mice with p53ER/− mice to generate Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice. We also generated the mice with the following genotypes as positive and negative controls for MDM2 function, respectively: Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− and Mdm2−/−;p53ER/−. Previous studies have shown that Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− mice tolerate daily injections of tamoxifen (20Christophorou M.A. Martin-Zanca D. Soucek L. Lawlor E.R. Brown-Swigart L. Verschuren E.W. Evan G.I. Temporal dissection of p53 function in vitro and in vivo.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our study replicated these results. Following daily injection of tamoxifen, Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− mice survived the duration of the study (up to 40 days) with no apparent abnormalities. Surprisingly, under the same conditions the maximum survival time of Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice was ∼4–5 days (Fig. 1A). This dramatic difference between Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− and Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− mice suggests that a functional MDM2 RING domain is integral for maintaining homeostasis in adult mice. Further, mice lacking MDM2 (Mdm2−/−;p53ER/−) have been shown to perish ∼6 days after a single tamoxifen injection (23Ringshausen I. O'Shea C.C. Finch A.J. Swigart L.B. Evan G.I. Mdm2 is critically and continuously required to suppress lethal p53 activity in vivo.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 501-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We also compared the survival of Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice with that of Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− mice following tamoxifen injection. Surprisingly, we found that Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice lived an evidently shorter lifespan than Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− mice (Fig. 1B), which suggests that loss of MDM2 RING domain function through the MDM2C462A mutation may alter MDM2 functions toward p53 regulation and enhance p53 function. Because the MDM2C462A mutation disrupts MDM2–MDMX interaction and MDMX has been shown to be important for MDM2-mediated p53 regulation (24Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. MdmX protects p53 from Mdm2-mediated degradation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Kawai H. Lopez-Pajares V. Kim M.M. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M.

Mdmx enhances p53 ubiquitination by altering the substrate preference of the Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 2710-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether the differences in survival between Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice and either Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− mice or Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− mice could be dependent on differential MDMX protein stability or p53 regulation. To this end, we generated each of these mice in the background of MdmX deletion. We found that following tamoxifen injection, the median survival time of Mdm2C462A/C462A;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− mice was significantly shorter than that of Mdm2−/−;MdmX−/−; p53ER/− mice (Fig. 1C) and was equivalent to Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice (Fig. 1D), indicating that changes in MDMX-mediated p53 regulation or protein stability are unlikely to contribute to survival differences present in Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice. Further, the loss of MDMX did not contribute to changes in survival upon Mdm2 deletion, as Mdm2−/−;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− mice and Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− mice display similar survival times following tamoxifen injection (Fig. 1E), suggesting that in the absence of MDM2, MDMX plays a minimal role in contributing to organismal survival during basal levels of p53 activity. This notion is in line with previous studies in MdmX−/−; p53ER/− mice, which tolerate daily injections of tamoxifen for a median of ∼29 days (27Garcia D. Warr M.R. Martins C.P. Brown Swigart L. Passegué E. Evan G.I. Validation of MdmX as a therapeutic target for reactivating p53 in tumors.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1746-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which is a significantly longer period of survival than Mdm2−/−; p53ER/− mice, which survive approximately 7 days. Because the loss of MDM2 in p53ER/− mice leads to p53-induced apoptosis and organismal lethality, we sought to determine whether Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mouse death is correlated with changes in tissue homeostasis, including increased apoptosis. We injected tamoxifen into Mdm2+/+;p53ER/−, Mdm2−/−;p53ER/−, Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/−, Mdm2C462A/C462A;MdmX−/−;p53ER/−, and Mdm2−/−;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− mice once daily for 3 days and then collected tissues sensitive to p53-induced apoptosis, including colon and small intestine. We first performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) 2The abbreviations used are: H&Ehematoxylin and eosinMEFmouse embryonic fibroblast4-OHT4-hydroxytamoxifenqRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCR. staining to observe any changes in tissue architecture. The overall integrity of both small intestine and colon tissues harvested from Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− mice was maintained, and these tissues appeared relatively normal (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the small intestine and colon from Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− or Mdm2C462A/C462A;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− mice exhibited severe intestinal atrophy characterized by shortening of villi and marked hypocellularity of crypts compared with the corresponding MDM2 WT and MDM2-null control groups. To detect apoptosis in these tissues, we performed a TUNEL assay. Colon tissue from Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice exhibited more extensive apoptosis compared with either Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− or Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− colon tissue (Fig. 2C). Small intestine from Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice exhibited light TUNEL staining compared with Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− mice (Fig. 2D), but we suspect that this may be because the majority of cells from Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− small intestine have already completed the apoptotic process by this time, as indicated by a reduction in nuclear staining (blue). Notably, Mdm2C462A/C462A;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− tissues exhibited similar morphological changes to Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− tissues, which suggests that MDMX does not play a role in the morphological changes. hematoxylin and eosin mouse embryonic fibroblast 4-hydroxytamoxifen quantitative RT-PCR. The accelerated organismal lethality and increased apoptosis in tissues of Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice are consistent with increased p53 activity. To assess the effect of the MDM2C462A mutation on p53 transcriptional activity, we isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from each of the five genotypes and treated these cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). We then utilized qRT-PCR to detect changes in the transcription of several p53 target genes including p21, puma, and bax (Fig. 3A) (28el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R.

Tumor suppressor p53 is a direct transcriptional activator of the human bax gene.Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies, p21 transcription was elevated in Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− MEFs and was increased to a greater degree in Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− MEFs (23Ringshausen I. O'Shea C.C. Finch A.J. Swigart L.B. Evan G.I. Mdm2 is critically and continuously required to suppress lethal p53 activity in vivo.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 501-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although puma and bax transcription were nearly unchanged following 4-OHT treatment in Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− MEFs, an increase in their transcription was apparent in Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− MEFs. Interestingly, following 4-OHT treatment, p21, bax, and puma transcription were significantly increased in Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− MEFs to an even greater extent than in Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− or Mdm2−/−;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− MEFs, suggesting that p53 activity is greatest in Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− MEFs. Further, the deletion of MDMX did not significantly alter p53 activity in the presence of the MDM2C462A mutation. To confirm these observations in vivo, we harvested small intestine and lung from the p53ER mice after the daily administration of tamoxifen for 3 days. The trend that we observed in MEFs was also reflected in mouse tissue, including small intestine and lung, with Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− and Mdm2C462A/C462A;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− mice exhibiting the highest expression of each target gene (Fig. 3, B and C). Intriguingly, because mice bearing the MDM2C462A mutation exhibit greater p53 activity than mice lacking MDM2 altogether, these data suggest the possibility that MDM2-mediated p53 activity suppression is dependent on MDM2 RING function, and in the absence of this function MDM2 may have alternate p53 regulating capabilities in vivo. To confirm whether the shortened survival time of Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice is associated with p53 transcriptional activation at the protein level, we cultured early-passage MEFs in either the absence or presence of 4-OHT for different time points. Then we assayed the expression of p53 target genes p21 and MDM2 (Fig. 4A). In Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− MEFs, MDM2 and p21 levels were increased after 4-OHT exposure, which is consistent with the idea that the activation of p53ER by 4-OHT results in increased mdm2 and p21 transcription and translation. Consistent with in vivo survival trends, Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− MEFs exhibited high p21 expression when compared with either Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− or Mdm2−/−;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− MEFs, and the deletion of MdmX did not significantly impact this difference in p21 expression (Fig. 4B). Unsurprisingly, p53ER levels were also significantly increased in Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− and Mdm2−/−; p53ER/− MEFs compared with Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− MEFs (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with the role of the MDM2 RING domain in p53 degradation (25Kawai H. Lopez-Pajares V. Kim M.M. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. RING domain-mediated interaction is a requirement for MDM2's E3 ligase activity.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6026-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, MDMX was induced by the MDM2 deletion or the RING domain mutation because of the loss of E3 ligase function, which is also consistent with previous studies (31Pan Y. Chen J. MDM2 promotes ubiquitination and degradation of MDMX.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5113-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 32Kawai H. Wiederschain D. Kitao H. Stuart J. Tsai K.K. Yuan Z.M.

Oren, M., Inhibition of p53 degradation by Mdm2 acetylation.FEBS Lett. 2004; 561: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We also noticed that following 4-OHT treatment, p53ER levels continued to increase in Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− and Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− MEFs (Fig. 4A). This effect is likely due to the regulation of p53 by other ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating enzymes, such as HAUSP (34Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Deubiquitination of p53 by HAUSP is an important pathway for p53 stabilization.Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that p53 activation requires its own acetylation (35Tang Y. Zhao W. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Gu W. Acetylation is indispensable for p53 activation.Cell. 2008; 133: 612-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The acetylation of p53 through interaction with co-factors p300/CBP is required for p53 to bind to DNA and promote the transcription of p21 and other downstream targets (36Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. p300/CBP-mediated p53 acetylation is commonly induced by p53-activating agents and inhibited by MDM2.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 37Grossman S.R. p300/CBP/p53 interaction and regulation of the p53 response.Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2773-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Consequently, we sought to ascertain whether the MDM2C462A mutation affects p53 acetylation, thereby elevating p53 transcriptional activity. To normalize for the variations in p53ER protein levels in each of the different MEFs, we calculated the ratio of acetylated p53ER to total p53ER protein levels (Fig. 4C). Although p53ER protein levels were consistently highest in cells lacking MDM2 (Fig. 4A), relative p53ER acetylation levels were highest in cells harboring the MDM2C462A mutation (Fig. 4C). To confirm these results in vivo, we injected tamoxifen into Mdm2+/+;p53ER/−, Mdm2−/−;p53ER/−, Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/−, Mdm2C462A/C462A;MdmX−/−;p53ER/−, and Mdm2−/−; MdmX−/−;p53ER/− mice once daily for 3 days and then analyzed the protein levels of total and acetylated p53ER, as well as p53 target gene protein levels in spleen, small intestine, colon, and lung tissues (Fig. 5, A–D). In all tissues, MDMX protein accumulated in Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− and Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/−; however, it barely controlled p53 transcriptional activity in the absence of MDM2 or MDM2 RING domain function. On the other hand, p21 and MDM2 protein levels were highest in Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− and Mdm2C462A/C462A;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− mouse tissues. We further quantified p21 levels in three independent experiments and found that p21 was significantly elevated in all Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− and Mdm2C462A/C462A;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− mouse tissues compared with their respective Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− and Mdm2−/−;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− counterparts (Fig. 5E). Further, differences in p53ER acetylation were far more apparent in mice than in MEFs, and relative p53ER acetylation levels were significantly increased in Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− and Mdm2C462A/C462A;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− mouse tissues compared with either Mdm2−/−;p53ER/− or Mdm2−/−;MdmX−/−;p53ER/− tissues (Fig. 5F). These increases in relative acetylation correlate with both the increased p53 activity and early lethality observed in mice bearing the MDM2C462A mutation and suggest that MDM2 RING function may be required for MDM2-mediated p53 transcriptional regulation in vivo. The results of this study have provided some clarification of the role of the MDM2 RING domain in the regulation of p53 post-embryogenesis. First, whereas the two key functions of this domain (E3 ligase activity and MDMX binding) can be individually lost with little consequence in adult, unstressed mice (15Tollini L.A. Jin A. Park J. Zhang Y. Regulation of p53 by Mdm2 E3 ligase function is dispensable in embryogenesis and development, but essential in response to DNA damage.Cancer Cell. 2014; 26: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Pant V. Xiong S. Iwakuma T. Quintás-Cardama A. Lozano G. Heterodimerization of Mdm2 and Mdm4 is critical for regulating p53 activity during embryogenesis but dispensable for p53 and Mdm2 stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11995-12000Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), at least one of these functions is required to maintain tissue homeostasis (Fig. 2). When both E3 ligase activity and MDMX binding capabilities are lost, MDM2–p53 binding is not sufficient to control basal p53 transcriptional activity and prevent p53-induced apoptosis and organismal lethality (Fig. 1). This is principally demonstrated by the early lethality of Mdm2C462A/C462A;p53ER/− mice compared with Mdm2+/+;p53ER/− mice (Fig. 1A). Second, the presence of the MDM2C462A mutation correlated with both increased p53 transcriptional activation and acetylation compared with the complete absence of MDM2 (Fig. 5). There are several possibilities that could explain this observation. First, studies in our lab have revealed that the MDM2C462A mutation facilitates greater interaction of p53 with histone acetyl transferase CBP/p300 (15Tollini L.A. Jin A. Park J. Zhang Y. Regulation of p53 by Mdm2 E3 ligase function is dispensable in embryogenesis and development, but essential in response to DNA damage.Cancer Cell. 2014; 26: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Clegg H.V. Itahana Y. Itahana K. Ramalingam S. Zhang Y. Mdm2 RING mutation enhances p53 transcriptional activity and p53-p300 interaction.PloS one. 2012; 7: e38212Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), an important co-activator of p53 that potentiates p53 acetylation and transcriptional activity (37Grossman S.R. p300/CBP/p53 interaction and regulation of the p53 response.Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2773-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Previous in vitro studies have also shown that disruption of the MDM2 RING domain disrupts MDM2–MDMX binding but not MDM2 homodimer formation (39Leslie P.L. Ke H. Zhang Y. The MDM2 RING domain and central acidic domain play distinct roles in MDM2 protein homodimerization and MDM2–MDMX protein heterodimerization.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 12941-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the MDM2C462A mutation clearly disrupts MDM2–MDMX binding, whether or not it affects MDM2 homodimerization in vivo remains unknown. It is possible that MDM2–MDMX binding serves to inhibit MDM2 p300-mediated acetylation of p53 but that monomeric or homodimeric MDM2 could enhance p300–p53 interaction and functional activation. Because we have recently shown that the MDM2 RING domain is required for MDM2–MDMX heterodimerization but not for MDM2-MDM2 homodimerization (39Leslie P.L. Ke H. Zhang Y. The MDM2 RING domain and central acidic domain play distinct roles in MDM2 protein homodimerization and MDM2–MDMX protein heterodimerization.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 12941-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it is possible that the MDM2C462A mutant forms a homodimer, which may have a stronger binding affinity to acetyltransferases. This would suggest that MDM2-mediated inhibition of p53 acetylation by p300 requires MDM2–MDMX interaction, which is supported by the correlation of the MDM2C462A mutation with increased p53 acetylation in mouse tissues (Fig. 5F). Although overexpressed MDMX has been shown to inhibit p300-mediated p53 acetylation (40Sabbatini P. McCormick F. MDMX inhibits the p300/CBP-mediated acetylation of p53.DNA and cell biology. 2002; 21: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), our data could suggest that MDMX alone cannot inhibit p300–p53 interaction in vivo, because the loss of MDMX does not appear to increase p53 acetylation or activity beyond that which is observed in the presence of the MDM2C462A mutation (Fig. 5), although this hypothesis remains to be tested in vivo. It is also possible that the MDM2 RING domain is required for the inhibitory functions of MDM2–p53 binding. For example, in vitro assays using an overexpressed human equivalent HDM2C464A mutation have demonstrated that a functional RING domain is necessary for MDM2-mediated p53 export (41Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. The MDM2 RING-finger domain is required to promote p53 nuclear export.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In this context, MDM2C462A could tether p53 to the nucleus, allowing for increased interaction with DNA and greater transcriptional activity. The combination of increased p53 acetylation and activity with nuclear sequestration could explain why mice bearing the MDM2C462A mutation demonstrate increased p53 activity compared with mice lacking MDM2 (Fig. 3). This study suggests the following about in vivo MDM2-mediated p53 regulation: 1) the MDM2 RING domain contributes to the regulation of p53 transcriptional activity in adult mice; and 2) MDM2–p53 binding is not sufficient for p53 regulation and adult organismal survival; and 3) in the absence of MDM2 or MDM2 RING domain function, MDMX does not appear to play a role in regulating p53 transcriptional activity in adult mice. However, it remains possible that the observations made in this study could be specific to the MDM2C462A mutation or p53ER. In future studies it would be useful to confirm these results using another model system, such as mice lacking the MDM2 RING domain, containing an alternate RING-disrupting mutation or an alternate inducible p53 model. The results of this study also have implications for p53-inducing therapies. Small molecule compounds that inhibit MDM2–p53 interaction, like nutlin-3a, have been widely used to facilitate p53 activation (42Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z.

In vivo activation of the p53 pathway by small-molecule antagonists of MDM2.Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Our study suggests the possibility that compounds targeting MDM2 RING domain function could produce even more robust p53 activation. To generate mice bearing the genotypes used in this study, we bred p53ER/− mice with mice from several different backgrounds, including Mdm2−/−, Mdm2C462A/C462A, and MdmX−/− (10Parant J.

All experimental procedures were approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To restore p53ER function, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 100 mg/kg of tamoxifen (T5648; Sigma) according to body weight. MEF cells were isolated from embryonic day 13.5–16.5 embryos and cultured in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 100 IU/ml penicillin (Gibco). To restore p53ER function in vitro, cultured MEFs were exposed to 100 nm 4-OHT (H7904; Sigma) for the indicated amounts of time. Protein was extracted from organs and cells as described previously (14Itahana K. Mao H. Jin A. Itahana Y. Clegg H.V. Lindström M.S. Bhat K.P. Godfrey V.L. Evan G.I. Zhang Y.

Protein lysates were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Procedures and conditions for immunoblotting were described previously. The following antibodies were purchased commercially: monoclonal mouse anti-MDMX (MDMX-82; Sigma), monoclonal mouse anti-actin (MAB1501; EMD Millipore), polyclonal rabbit anti-acetyl-p53 (K379; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), and polyclonal goat anti-p21 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The monoclonal mouse anti-p53 (pAB122) and monoclonal mouse anti-MDM2 (2A10) were homemade by our laboratory. The intensity of the bands in the linear range of exposure was quantified using ImageJ 1.46r. Total RNA was prepared from mouse tissues using TRIzol® reagent (15596-026; Invitrogen). RNA concentration was determined with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, NanoDropTM 2000c), and quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (18080-051; Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed with SYBR Green probes using the Applied Biosystems 7900HT fast real-time PCR system. Thermal cycling conditions were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Target gene transcript levels were normalized to β-actin transcript levels obtained in each sample via the subtraction of the Ct value of β-actin from the Ct value for each target gene. The results were expressed as the fold change in transcript levels. Primers used for qRT-PCR were as follows: p21; 5′-TCCACAGCGATATCCAGACA-3′ and 5′-AGACAACGGCACACTTTGCT-3′; Puma, 5′-TGTGGAGGAGGAGGAGTGG-3′ and 5′-TGCTGCTCTTCTTGTCTCCG-3′; Bax, 5′-GGACAGCAATATGGAGCTGCAGAGG-3′ and 5′-GGAGGAAGTCCAGTGTCCAGCC-3′; and β-actin, 5′-GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT-3′. Tissues were dissected, flushed gently with cold PBS, fixed in 10% formalin overnight, dehydrated in 50% ethanol, and stored in 70% ethanol until they were transferred to the Histology Research Core Facility at University of North Carolina for paraffin embedding. The tissues were then cut into 4-μm sections and then processed for H&E staining. TUNEL staining for apoptosis was performed using a Apoptag peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TUNEL stained tissue was analyzed using an Olympus IX-81 microscope fitted with a SPOT camera and software. The results are represented as means ± S.E. of the mean. Quantitative PCR data and immunoblotting quantifications were evaluated for significance using the unpaired t test. A p value <0.05 was considered significant for all analyses. Significant differences between experimental groups were as follows: *, p < 0.05; or **, p < 0.01. Calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software.

We tested the hypothesis here whether the cumulative effect of glucose raising SNPs, assessed via a score, is associated with glucose levels. A total of 1,434 participants of Greek descent from the THISEAS study and 1,160 participants form the GOMAP study were included in this analysis. We developed a genetic risk score (GRS), based on the known glucose-raising loci, in order to investigate the cumulative effect of known glucose loci on glucose levels. In the THISEAS study, the GRS score was significantly associated with increased glucose levels (mmol/L) (β ± SE: 0.024 ± 0.004, P = 8.27e-07). The effect of the genetic risk score was also significant in the GOMAP study (β ± SE: 0.011 ± 0.005, P = 0.031). In the meta-analysis of the two studies both scores were significantly associated with higher glucose levels GRS: β ± SE: 0.019 ± 0.003, P = 1.41e-09. Also, variants at the SLC30A8, PROX1, MTNR1B, ADRA2A, G6PC2, LPIN3 loci indicated nominal evidence for association with glucose levels (p < 0.05). We replicate associations of the established glucose raising variants in the Greek population and confirm directional consistency of effects (binomial sign test p = 6.96e-05). We also demonstrate that the cumulative effect of the established glucose loci yielded a significant association with increasing glucose levels."

However, the mechanism by which HsvA contributes to virulence is unclear. To investigate the role of HsvA in virulence, we carried out a series of biochemical and structural studies to characterize the amidinotransferase activity of HsvA. We found that HsvA displays a preference for linear aliphatic polyamines as the amidino acceptor substrate, especially for spermidine and putrescine (Km values of 33 μm and 3.9 mm, respectively). The three-dimensional structure, determined at 2.30 Å resolution using X-ray crystallography, revealed that the overall architecture of HsvA is similar to that of the human arginine–glycine amidinotransferase in the creatine biosynthesis pathway. The active site is located in the core of the protein at the base of a long, narrow substrate access channel. Specific amino acids near the entrance of the channel may serve as major determinants of the substrate specificity, including a glutamate residue at the rim of the channel entrance that appears to be positioned to interact with the distal primary amine in the putrescine substrate as well as the internal and distal amines in the spermidine substrate.

Mice lacking a functional Ren1d gene are devoid of renal juxtaglomerular cell granules and exhibit an altered macula densa morphology. Due to the species-specificity of renin activity, transgenic mice are ideal models for experimentally investigating and manipulating expression patterns of the human renin gene in a native cellular environment without confounding renin–angiotensin system interactions. A 55-kb transgene encompassing the human renin locus was crossed onto the mouse Ren1d-null background, restoring granulation in juxtaglomerular cells. Correct processing of human renin in dense core granules was confirmed by immunogold labeling. After stimulation of the renin–angiotensin system, juxtaglomerular cells contained rhomboid protogranules with paracrystalline contents, dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum, and electron-lucent granular structures. However, complementation of Ren1d−/− mice with human renin was unable to rescue the abnormality seen in macula densa structure. The juxtaglomerular apparatus was still able to respond to tubuloglomerular feedback in isolated perfused juxtaglomerular apparatus preparations, although minor differences in glomerular tuft contractility and macula densa cell calcium handling were observed. This study reveals that the human renin protein is able to complement the mouse Ren1d−/− non-granulated defect and suggests that granulopoiesis requires a structural motif that is conserved between the mouse Ren1d and human renin proteins.

The renin–angiotensin system plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance through the production of the vasoactive peptide hormone angiotensin II (Ang-II). 4The abbreviations used are: AngangiotensinACEangiotensin-converting enzymeJGjuxtaglomerularMDmacular densaTGFtubuloglomerular feedbackJGAjuxtaglomerular apparatusTEMtransmission electron microscopyAAafferent arteriole. Renin catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang-I), which is then cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to produce Ang-II. Renin, generally considered to be the rate-limiting step in the angiotensin cascade, is predominantly produced in the juxtaglomerular (JG) cells of the kidney. Within these cells, renin is packaged and stored within membrane-bound electron-dense granules, although the factors and dynamic processes governing the onset and maturation of granules remain to be fully elucidated (1Hackenthal E.

In contrast to Ren2−/− mice, Ren1d−/− animals had increased plasma concentrations of inactive prorenin and decreased circulating active renin. However, most striking was the complete absence of renin storage/secretory granules in the JG cells of the renal afferent arteriole in Ren1d−/− animals. These studies suggested that expression of Ren2 could partially compensate for the loss of Ren1d with respect to maintaining arterial blood pressure but was unable to maintain normal juxtaglomerular apparatus structure. In transgenesis experiments with a 145-kb BAC construct spanning both the mouse Ren2 and Ren1d loci, homozygous Ren1d-null mice expressing the BAC clone exhibited complete restoration of normal renal structure (12Mullins L.J.

The introduction of a modified 145-kb BAC transgene, in which the Ren1d locus was disrupted by introduction of a β-galactosidase-neomycin resistance (β-geo) reporter, onto the Ren1d knock-out background demonstrated reporter gene expression in the absence of renin-1d. Taken together, these experiments confirm that expression of the renin-1d protein is a prerequisite for granule formation and maturation, and that the Ren2 gene product is unable to act as substitute in this role. In addition, a discrete and reproducible change was observed in the cell number and morphology of the macula densa (MD) cells of the kidney distal tubular epithelium of Ren1d−/− mice (11Clark A.F.

Extensive cross-talk between the flow- and salt-sensing MD plaque of the cortical thick ascending limb and JG cells plays a significant role in the secretion of renin as part of tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF). TGF signaling acts to fine-tune single nephron glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to fluctuating distal tubular sodium concentrations; low sodium induces renin secretion, whereas high sodium at the MD plaque inhibits renin secretion, causes vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole (AA), and a decline in single nephron GFR (13Yan Y.

We report the dissection of the Ren1d knock-out mouse phenotypes by complementation with the human renin gene. Granulation of JG cells was restored in a transgene expression level-dependent manner, with higher levels of renin expression correlating with increased granular number and volume. Complementation did not restore MD morphology, which retained the same hypercellular and columnar appearance as Ren1d−/− mice. However, this altered morphology was not indicative of MD function; both Ren1d−/− mice and human renin complemented mice were able to perform TGF effectively in isolated perfused juxtaglomerula apparatus (JGA) preparations. A 55-kb fragment of PAC 111L11, transgene hRen, containing ∼35 kb of 5′-flanking and 10 kb of 3′-flanking sequences was used to generate transgenic mice by pronuclear microinjection. Two of four founder mice were backcrossed to Ren1d−/− mice (Fig. 1, A and B) and hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice were used for detailed pheotypic analyses. Progeny from both founders showed similar results and line 1446 was expanded and used for more detailed study. Diagnostic Southern blot hybridization was used to confirm inheritance of the human renin transgene by the presence of 2.0- and 7.9-kb human-specific fragments (Fig. 1C). The granulation status of renal JG cells was assessed by 2D transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Examination of the subcellular structure of Ren1d−/− mice confirmed the absence of electron-dense secretory granules in the JG cells of Ren1d−/− mice (Fig. 2, A and B), as previously described (11Clark A.F. Sharp M.G. Morley S.D. Fleming S. Peters J. Mullins J.J. Renin-1 is essential for normal renal juxtaglomerular cell granulation and macula densa morphology.J. Biol.

The only visible subcellular organelles were small cytoplasmic electron-lucent vesicles (gray arrowheads) and mitochondria (white arrowheads). This is illustrated in the magnified inset, where the characteristic lines associated with mitochondria can be seen (Fig. 2B). In contrast, TEM examination of the subcellular structure of hRen+/−Ren1d−/− renal JG cells revealed the presence of dense-core secretory granules in both males (Fig. 2, C and D) and females (Fig. 2, E and F). Granule electron density was seen to be uniform, particularly in female hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice (Fig. 2, E and F, white asterisks). As well as the dense core granules (white asterisks) and mitochondria (white arrowheads), rough endoplasmic reticulum (dashed white arrow), small electron-lucent vesicles (gray arrowheads), and immature granules (black arrowheads) were visible. Paracrystalline protogranules (double arrows) were also occasionally present in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2, E and F). Confirmation of the presence of active human renin within dense core granules of hRen+/−Ren1d−/− JG cells was performed on ultrathin sections using immunogold labeling (Fig. 2G). Staining was observed overwhelmingly within the dense core granules (∼88%, white asterisks), with no staining within the mitochondria (white arrowheads). A small subset of immunogold particles stained the cytoplasm (∼12%, black arrows) and there was only a single instance of staining within electron-lucent granules (white arrow). Many more large dense granules (white asterisks) were visible in JG cells from females (Fig. 2, E and F) when compared with those from male hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice (Fig. 2, C and D). To quantitatively compare granulation levels between male and female hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice, serial sections were imaged using TEM. The granules, membrane, and nucleus were manually segmented within the image to generate faithful 3D reconstructions of JG cells and their intracellular organelles (Fig. 3). Although rare instances of linkages between granules were seen in female hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice (Fig. 3A), the majority were regular in size and shape, existing as solitary granules rather than as part of a larger network. These took up on average 20% extranuclear space compared with the 10% cytoplasmic volume of granules in JG cells from male hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice (Fig. 3C). The granules from this group were irregular in shape and size and significantly less densely packed (Fig. 3B). Granules showed non-uniform electron density, and the number of granules per cell was more variable (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). The average granule number in JG cells from male hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice was also significantly lower than those found in females (Fig. 3D). To determine whether hRen transgene expression levels could be regulated by pharmacological manipulation and whether granulation was correlated with the transgene expression level, groups of mice were treated with the ACE inhibitor, captopril. Male and female hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice were subjected to captopril or vehicle treatment for 10 days. Following this period, plasma was collected to measure plasma active human renin and mouse renin levels. Mice were sacrificed and kidney tissue collected for histological examination and to assess transgene expression by quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative PCR confirmed that human renin was not expressed in Ren1d −/− mice, either at baseline or after treatment with captopril (Fig. 4A). In hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice, expression of the hRen transgene was higher in females compared with males at baseline (11-fold). Captopril treatment led to a significant increase in hRen expression in males (93-fold) and females (22-fold) (Fig. 4A). Expression of mRen2 tended to show a slight increase after captopril treatment but did not significantly differ between genotypes of each sex (Fig. 4B). However, human and mouse plasma renin concentrations increased dramatically after inhibition in both males and females (Fig. 4, C and D). TEM was performed to examine the subcellular structure of the Ren1d−/− and hRen-complemented Ren1d−/− JG cells following ACE inhibition. In Ren1d−/− mice, large, electron-lucent granules were visible (Fig. 5A, black arrowheads), as were mitochondria (Fig. 5, A and B, white arrowheads) and lysosomal-type structures (Fig. 5B, black arrow). Furthermore, many small vesicles were identifiable in the cytosol (Fig. 5B, gray arrowheads), with a prominent RER visible after captopril treatment (Fig. 5C, dashed white arrow). Higher levels of granulation were evident after ACE inhibition in male hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice, along with vastly dilated RER (Fig. 5, D–F, dashed white arrow), suggesting increased renin protein synthesis. Interestingly, captopril treatment induced the formation of electron-lucent (black arrowheads) as well as electron-dense (white asterisks) granules within hRen+/−Ren1d−/− JG cells (Fig. 5, D–F). These granules varied in both electron-lucency and size, from small granules surrounded by dilated RER to larger, merged dense-core granules (Fig. 5, E and F, white arrows). To quantify this, the mean pixel intensity was determined for each granule and normalized to the cytosol mean pixel intensity. Using this method, the darker and more electron-dense the granule the more negative the normalized mean pixel value. Comparing this value in untreated and captopril-treated hRen+/−Ren1d−/− JG cells clearly showed that the granules were, on average, more electron-lucent in JG cells from animals that have undergone ACE inhibition (Fig. 5G). Images also strongly suggested that coalescence of paracrystalline material within granules and immature granules were present to a greater degree after captopril treatment than at baseline (Fig. 5, D–F, double black arrows). Consistent with previous findings (11Clark A.F. Sharp M.G. Morley S.D. Fleming S. Peters J. Mullins J.J. Renin-1 is essential for normal renal juxtaglomerular cell granulation and macula densa morphology.J. Biol.

To further investigate intracellular ultrastructure, TEM images of MD were acquired and structural cellular parameters quantified and compared with C57Bl/6 controls (Fig. 6, D–E, H, and I). Control C57Bl/6 MD cells were characterized by invaginations of the plasma membrane along the border with JG cells, which was not evident in distal tubule cells on the opposite face of the tubule. In contrast, in Ren1d−/− and hRen+/−Ren1d−/− MD cells there was little invagination of the plasma membrane but intercellular spaces between MD cells were large. In Ren1d−/− and hRen+/−Ren1d−/− MD cells, mitochondria (white arrowheads) were small and sparsely distributed in the cell compared with the large, dilated mitochondria found in C57Bl/6 MD cells (p < 0.05). There also appeared to be a difference in MD nuclear chromatin between groups; a greater amount of dense nuclear chromatin (red arrowheads) was seen in Ren1d−/− groups compared with the pale chromatin indicative of dilated chromatin in C57Bl/6 controls. However, the appearance of microvilli (yellow arrowheads) and intercellular junctions between MD cells did not appear to differ between groups. To determine whether this altered morphology was indicative of impaired TGF in the juxtaglomerular apparatus environment, freshly dissected C57Bl/6, Ren1d−/−, and hRen+/−Ren1d−/− glomerular tufts with attached afferent arteriole, cTAL and MD plaques were microperfused. Either perfusate flow (Fig. 7) or NaCl concentration (data not shown) was varied at the MD plaque, and the TGF responses were measured via elevations in intracellular [Ca2+]i and mechanical responses of the glomerular tuft and afferent arteriole, as previously described (15Peti-Peterdi J. Calcium wave of tubuloglomerular feedback.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 291 (16495210): F473-F48010.1152/ajprenal.00425.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). All groups demonstrated appropriate TGF in response to both stimuli; afferent arteriole contraction (Fig. 7A, white arrows) and glomerular tuft contraction were seen in response to the triggered TGF, and calcium waves were seen to move throughout the JGA preparation. Quantification of these responses showed no difference in response of the afferent arteriole contraction (Fig. 7B), however, the change in glomerular tuft area was slightly blunted in both Ren1d−/− or hRen+/−Ren1d−/− groups (Fig. 7C). No significant differences in [Ca2+]i elevations through vascular smooth muscle cell, podocytes, cortical thick ascending limb or JG cells in the JGA were detected (data not shown). In MD cells, more [Ca2+]i propagated through MD cells in both the Ren1d−/− and hRen+/−Ren1d−/− groups compared with the C57Bl/6 group (Fig. 7D), although this was not significant. This effect was heterogeneous, seen only in certain MD cells in the plaque. Previous data have revealed that the presence of the renin-1d protein is essential for granule formation in two renin gene mice (11Clark A.F. Sharp M.G. Morley S.D. Fleming S. Peters J. Mullins J.J. Renin-1 is essential for normal renal juxtaglomerular cell granulation and macula densa morphology.J. Biol.

We now show that complementation of the Ren1d knock-out mouse with human renin results in a restoration of the granulation in the JG cells of the kidney in a transgene expression level-dependent manner. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the human and mouse renin-1d proteins have conserved structural features necessary for the trafficking of the renin proteins to the regulated pathway of secretion, and thus the formation of dense renin-containing granules. Immunogold labeling confirmed the human renin localization within restored dense core granules. Data from the present study also supports the hypothesis that the level of dense core granulation formation is dependent on the expression level of renin protein. In the hRen+/−Ren1d−/− animals, a slight nonsignificant gender-based increase in basal mRen2 expression was seen in the females. However, females showed significantly increased hRen transgene expression levels, giving us an effective system in which to investigate the process of granulation at different expression levels without confounding RAS interactions. This difference was also seen in a further, independent transgenic line (1317 hRen+/−Ren1d−/−). 5R. J. Nelson and C. Buckley, unpublished observations. In male hRen+/−Ren1d−/− animals, rescue of the granulation of the JG cells was blunted compared with females, which was mirrored in the hRen expression levels. 3D reconstructions of JG cells in untreated hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice revealed that females formed a larger number of granules, which occupied significantly more extranuclear volume than males and were more regular in shape. These data suggest that the basal level of hRen expression in JG cells of male mice is insufficient to drive complete granulation, but that up-regulation of human renin expression allows increased granulopoiesis. A number of electron-lucent granules from male hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice were visualized in 2D and 3D and shown to contain areas of paracrystalline material, particularly after captopril treatment. This suggests incomplete granule formation and may show granules in the process of coalescing (1Hackenthal E. Paul M. Ganten D. Taugner R. Morphology, physiology, and molecular biology of renin secretion.Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70 (2217555): 1067-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice responded appropriately to pharmacological manipulation of the RAS via chronic ACE inhibition, as shown by the increase in human renin expression levels. The relative insensitivity of mRen2 expression to the administration of captopril is likely to be due to the fact that expression and secretion of mRen2 is not controlled by the regulated release pathway of active renin, because it is constitutively released. This is supported by the observation that, in humans, acute administration of ACE inhibitors causes either a fall in prorenin secretion, or no change at all, whereas active renin is significantly elevated (16Goldstone R. Horton R. Carlson E.J. Hsueh W.A. Reciprocal changes in active and inactive renin after converting enzyme inhibition in normal man.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1983; 56 (6296183): 264-26810.1210/jcem-56-2-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Toffelmire E.B. Slater K. Corvol P. Menard J. Schambelan M.

Invest. 1989; 83 (2643635): 679-68710.1172/JCI113932Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Treatment with captopril induced increased renin expression and granulation within JG cells. Treated Ren1d−/− mice showed dilated RER as well as the appearance of electron-lucent granules and vacuoles in JG cells. This is particularly interesting because electron-lucent granules were observed even though no active renin was able to be synthesized. This may suggest that when the RAS is strongly stimulated, granule formation is initiated irrespective of renin transcription, perhaps to facilitate demand for renin when perfusion pressure drops (18Kurtz A. Renin release: sites, mechanisms, and control.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2011; 73 (20936939): 377-39910.1146/annurev-physiol-012110-142238Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similar features were also present in captopril-treated hRen+/−Ren1d−/− mice, where the increased number of granules exhibited a wider range of electron-lucency compared with untreated hRen+/−Ren1d−/− JG cells. This diversity of granule electron densities has also been documented in C57Bl/6 mice after perfusion with isoproterenol and EGTA to stimulate secretion (2Steppan D. Zügner A. Rachel R. Kurtz A.

Granule electron densities were categorized into normal, vesicles in transition from normal to lower density, low density, and emptied, all of which are visible in captopril-treated hRen+/−Ren1d−/− JG cells. The appearance of electron-lucent granules were attributed to emptying of existing granules rather than production of new granules, due to their location at the cell periphery and the short incubation time used in the study, insufficient for the production of new granules (2Steppan D.

In the present study, we developed a cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) tagged luciferase (TAT-LUC) for tumor chemosensitivity assay. The activity of recombinant TAT-LUC was evaluated using ATP standard solution and tumor cells. This recombinant TAT-LUC was then used for the analysis of sensitivity index (SI) of four strains of tumor cells. The results showed that TAT-LUC could detect less than 10 nM extracellular ATP with a strong correlation between the luminescence intensity and the ATP content (R2 = 0.994). Without cell lysis, the detection limit for intracellular ATP analysis was 40 tumor cells. Furthermore, chemosensitivity of four strains of tumor cells (Skov-3/DDP, A549/DDP, MDA-MB-231, Huh-7) was determined by this assay successfully. The cell penetration ability of TAT-LUC enables the assay not only to reflect drug resistance of tumor cells real-timely but also to minimize the test time, which can be a valuable aid for personalized cancer chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2767600364,"Nitrergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) may play a role in physiological stress responses. The caudal lateral wings (CLW) are unique compared to other rostral-caudal DRN sub-regions because they contain distinct nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) populations that are independent of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). NOS neurons in the CLW are also highly activated during acute restraint stress. However, the effects of acute stress duration on NOS activation in the CLW are unclear. Here NADPH-d, an index of NOS activity, is used to show that sub-regions of the DRN have differential NOS activation in response to 6 hours of restraint stress in rats. We report increased NOS activity through 6 hours of restraint in the caudal lateral wings and ventromedial sub-regions. These data suggest that, NOS neurons may play a dynamic role in the response to stress duration."

Elephants and whales have bigger brains, so comparing anatomy or even genomes of humans and other animals reveals little about the genetic and developmental changes that sent our brains down such a different path. Geneticists have identified a few key differences in the genes of humans and apes. But specifically how human variants of such genes shape our brain in development—and how they drove its evolution—have remained largely mysterious. Now, researchers are deploying new tools to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the unique features of our brain. At a symposium at The American Society of Human Genetics in Orlando, Florida, last month, they reported zooming in on the genes expressed in a single brain cell, as well as panning out to understand how genes foster connections among far-flung brain regions.
