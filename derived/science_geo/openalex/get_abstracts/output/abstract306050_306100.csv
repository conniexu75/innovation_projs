Such reactions have been extensively explored for mononuclear complexes. Two classes of polynuclear species exhibit similar properties, and these complexes are now being studied as possible homogeneous sensitizer-catalysts for hydrogen production from aqueous solutions."

https://openalex.org/W2022985877,Fossils newly discovered in the Paleocene and early Eocene of western North America document some of the oldest birds known from nearly complete skeletons. These were medium-sized carinates with powers of sustained flight but which had a paleognathous palate like that of the flightless ostrich-like birds and the tinamous. The fossils provide additional evidence that the paleognathous palate is probably primitive and therefore should not be cited as a derived character state to define the ostrich-like birds as a monophyletic group.

Bose was kind enough to lend me his instruments for the repetition of some of his more important experiments in the Institute of Plant Physiology of the University. As this is the first time that his experiments have been successfully repeated in a European laboratory, the following results which I obtained will be of interest to readers of NATURE."

https://openalex.org/W2067612087,"The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) takes a commercial perspective when it recommends that the administration cooperate with Europe and the Soviet Union on the Siberian natural-gas pipeline because there is no evidence that a trade boycott could succeed, although it could slow progress. The US can take other initiatives, such as building stockpiles or installing dual-fuel boilers, to help Europe avoid energy dependence on the USSR. President Reagan has no coherent trade policy toward the USSR, partly because he fears rapid energy development and exports would provide the Soviets with capital to buy supplies and compensate for their own economic problems. The OTA concludes that the Soviets will manage without US technology, that both oil and natural gas production will increase slower than US intelligence estimates, and that gas production will increase at a pace with European interest in selling steel and finding non-OPEC energy sources.
