https://openalex.org/W2480829753,"The generation of genetic variation (somatic hypermutation) is an essential process for the adaptive immune system in vertebrates. We demonstrate the targeted single-nucleotide substitution of DNA using hybrid vertebrate and bacterial immune systems components. Nuclease-deficient type II CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) and the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) ortholog PmCDA1 were engineered to form a synthetic complex (Target-AID) that performs highly efficient target-specific mutagenesis. Specific point mutation was induced primarily at cytidines within the target range of five bases. The toxicity associated with the nuclease-based CRISPR/Cas9 system was greatly reduced. Although combination of nickase Cas9(D10A) and the deaminase was highly effective in yeasts, it also induced insertion and deletion (indel) in mammalian cells. Use of uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor suppressed the indel formation and improved the efficiency."

Resident macrophages are professional phagocytes that survey their surroundings; eliminate unfit cells, microorganisms, and metabolic waste; and produce a large range of bioactive molecules and growth factors. Resident macrophages also serve tissue-specific purposes: For example, microglia in the central nervous system support neuronal circuit development, Kupffer cells scavenge blood particles and dying red blood cells in the liver, and alveolar macrophages uptake surfactant and remove airborne pollutants and microbes from the airways. Resident macrophage diversity in adult mice is reflected in tissue-specific gene expression profiles, which may be due to responses to specific cues from their microenvironment, different developmental processes, and the contribution of distinct progenitors cell types. Altogether, the mechanisms responsible for the generation of tissue-resident macrophage diversity remain unclear. RATIONALE Tissue-resident macrophages originate, at least in part, from mesodermal erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) from the yolk sac, which invade the embryo proper at the onset of organogenesis. These tissue-resident macrophages are also self-maintained in postnatal tissues, independently of definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in a steady state. We therefore hypothesized that resident macrophages represent a founding cell type within most organ anlagen. In this model, the generation of macrophage diversity, as observed in the tissues of postnatal mice, may be integral to organogenesis. RESULTS To test this hypothesis and explore the molecular basis of macrophage diversity in mammals, we performed a spatiotemporal analysis of macrophage development in mice, from embryonic day 9 (E9) to 3 weeks after birth. Unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of CD45 + cells, combined with RNA-seq analyses of sorted cell populations, genetic fate mapping, and in situ analyses, revealed that EMPs give rise to a population of premacrophages (pMacs) that colonize the whole embryo from E9.5, as they acquire a core macrophage differentiation program that includes pattern recognition, scavengers, and cytokine receptors. The chemokine receptor Cx3cr1 is up-regulated in pMacs and is important for embryo colonization, which is delayed in Cx3cr1 -deficient embryos. Fate mapping of pMacs using a Tnfrsf11a –Cre reporter labels homogeneously fetal and adult tissue-resident macrophages but not HSCs and their progeny. Transcriptional regulators that identify postnatal tissue-resident macrophages in the brain, liver, kidney, skin, and lung were specifically up-regulated immediately after colonization. These dynamic changes mark the onset of diversification into adult macrophages. We identified Id3 as a Kupffer cell–specific transcriptional regulator. Deletion of Id3 in pMacs resulted in Kupffer cell deficiency but did not affect development of microglia and kidney macrophages. CONCLUSION Our study shows that EMP-derived precursors colonize embryonic tissues and simultaneously acquire a full core macrophage program. This is followed by their diversification into tissue-specific macrophages during organogenesis, likely via the expression of distinct sets of transcriptional regulators. These results indicate that differentiation of tissue-resident macrophages is an integral part of organogenesis and identify a spatiotemporal molecular road map for the generation of macrophage diversity in vivo. Our findings provide a conceptual framework to analyze and understand the consequence(s) of genetic variation for macrophage contribution to development, homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis in different tissues and will support efforts to differentiate specialized macrophages in vitro."

The development of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine is therefore an urgent global health priority. Here we demonstrate that three different vaccine platforms protect against ZIKV challenge in rhesus monkeys. A purified inactivated virus vaccine induced ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies and completely protected monkeys against ZIKV strains from both Brazil and Puerto Rico. Purified immunoglobulin from vaccinated monkeys also conferred passive protection in adoptive transfer studies. A plasmid DNA vaccine and a single-shot recombinant rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 vector vaccine, both expressing ZIKV premembrane and envelope, also elicited neutralizing antibodies and completely protected monkeys against ZIKV challenge. These data support the rapid clinical development of ZIKV vaccines for humans."

Until now, no human mutations have been linked to necroptosis. Ito et al. show that loss of optineurin, which is encoded by a gene that has been implicated in the human neurodegenerative disorder ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), results in sensitivity to necroptosis and axonal degeneration. When RIPK1-kinase dependent signaling is disrupted in mice that lack optineurin, necroptosis is inhibited and axonal pathology is reversed. Science , this issue p. 603"

This is economically feasible only on very large scales. Hence, methane produced in small amounts at remote locations is either burned or not extracted. A promising alternative is conversion to benzene and hydrogen with molybdenumzeolite catalysts. Unfortunately, these catalysts deactivate because of carbon buildup; plus, hydrogen has to be removed to drive the reaction forward. Morejudo et al. address both of these problems with a solid-state BaZrO 3 membrane reactor that electrochemically removes hydrogen and supplies oxygen to suppress carbon buildup.

Yet, it remains unclear whether these changes in nuclear structure are mediated by Xist and whether they are required for silencing. Here, we show that Xist directly interacts with the Lamin B receptor, an integral component of the nuclear lamina, and that this interaction is required for Xist-mediated silencing by recruiting the inactive X to the nuclear lamina and by doing so enables Xist to spread to actively transcribed genes across the X. Our results demonstrate that lamina recruitment changes the 3D structure of DNA, enabling Xist and its silencing proteins to spread across the X to silence transcription."

Here, we describe crystal structures of the native human 20S proteasome and its complexes with inhibitors, which either are drugs approved for cancer treatment or are in clinical trials. The structure of the native human 20S proteasome was determined at an unprecedented resolution of 1.8 angstroms. Additionally, six inhibitor-proteasome complex structures were elucidated at resolutions between 1.9 and 2.1 angstroms. Collectively, the high-resolution structures provide new insights into the catalytic mechanisms of inhibition and necessitate a revised description of the proteasome active site. Knowledge about inhibition mechanisms provides insights into peptide hydrolysis and can guide strategies for the development of next-generation proteasome-based cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2497017894,The stress-induced martensitic transformation in tensioned nickel-titanium shape-memory alloys proceeds by propagation of macroscopic fronts of localized deformation. We used three-dimensional synchrotron x-ray diffraction to image at micrometer-scale resolution the grain-resolved elastic strains and stresses in austenite around one such front in a prestrained nickel-titanium wire. We found that the local stresses in austenite grains are modified ahead of the nose cone-shaped buried interface where the martensitic transformation begins. Elevated shear stresses at the cone interface explain why the martensitic transformation proceeds in a localized manner. We established the crossover from stresses in individual grains to a continuum macroscopic internal stress field in the wire and rationalized the experimentally observed internal stress field and the topology of the macroscopic front by means of finite element simulations of the localized deformation.

It plays a crucial role in relativistic phenomena, such as Klein tunneling, but it is difficult to visualize directly. Here, we report the direct observation and manipulation of chirality and pseudospin polarization in the tunneling of electrons between two almost perfectly aligned graphene crystals. We use a strong in-plane magnetic field as a tool to resolve the contributions of the chiral electronic states that have a phase difference between the two components of their vector wave function. Our experiments not only shed light on chirality, but also demonstrate a technique for preparing graphene's Dirac electrons in a particular quantum chiral state in a selected valley."
https://openalex.org/W2496538528,"T cells must tightly regulate their metabolic processes to cope with varying bioenergetic demands depending on their state of differentiation. The metabolic sensor AMPK is activated in states of low energy supply and modulates cellular metabolism toward a catabolic state. Although this enzyme is known to be particularly active in regulatory T (Treg) cells, its impact on T helper (Th)-cell differentiation is poorly understood. We investigated the impact of several AMPK activators on Treg-cell differentiation and found that the direct activator AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide), but not the indirect activators metformin and 2-deoxyglucose, strongly enhanced Treg-cell induction by specifically enhancing Treg-cell expansion. Conversely, Th17 generation was impaired by the agent. Further investigation of the metabolic background of our observations revealed that AICAR enhanced both cellular mitochondrogenesis and fatty acid uptake. Consistently, increased Treg induction was entirely reversible on inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, thus confirming the dependence of AICAR's effects on metabolic pathways alterations. Translating our findings to an in vivo model, we found that the substance enhanced Treg cell generation on IL-2 complex-induced immune stimulation. We provide a previously unrecognized insight into the delicate interplay between immune cell function and metabolism and delineate a potential novel strategy for metabolism-targeting immunotherapy.-Gualdoni, G.

https://openalex.org/W2498341810,"Many organisms form elaborate mineralized structures, constituted of highly organized arrangements of crystals and organic macromolecules. The localization of crystals within these structures is presumably determined by the interaction of nucleating macromolecules with the mineral phase. Here we show that, preceding nucleation, a specific interaction between soluble organic molecules and an organic backbone structure directs mineral components to specific sites. This strategy underlies the formation of coccoliths, which are highly ordered arrangements of calcite crystals produced by marine microalgae. On combining the insoluble organic coccolith scaffold with coccolith-associated soluble macromolecules in vitro, we found a massive accretion of calcium ions at the sites where the crystals form in vivo. The in vitro process exhibits profound similarities to the initial stages of coccolith biogenesis in vivo."

In the superstructure, the gold molecules can come together in the excited state as excimers and then dissociate to emit radiation. Because they are within a lattice, this behavior shows long-term stability. Furthermore, the lattice superstructure scavenges reactive oxygen species and reduces cell damage.

https://openalex.org/W2480001487,"Mechanisms leading to decreased platelet count in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are heterogeneous. This study describes increased platelet apoptosis involving loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), caspase 3 activation (aCasp3) and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization in a cohort of adult ITP patients. Apoptosis was not related to platelet activation, as PAC-1 binding, P-selectin exposure and GPIb-IX internalization were not increased. Besides, ITP platelets were more sensitive to apoptotic stimulus in terms of aCasp3. Incubation of normal platelets with ITP plasma induced loss of ΔΨm, while PS exposure and aCasp3 remained unaltered. The increase in PS exposure observed in ITP platelets could be reproduced in normal platelets incubated with ITP plasma by adding normal CD3+ lymphocytes to the system as effector cells. Addition of leupeptin -a cathepsin B inhibitor- to this system protected platelets from apoptosis. Increased PS exposure was also observed when normal platelets and CD3+ lymphocytes were incubated with purified IgG from ITP patients and was absent when ITP plasma was depleted of auto-antibodies, pointing to the latter as responsible for platelet damage. Apoptosis was present in platelets from all patients carrying anti-GPIIb-IIIa and anti-GPIb auto-antibodies but was absent in the patient with anti-GPIa-IIa auto-antibodies. Platelet damage inversely correlated with platelet count and decreased during treatment with a thrombopoietin receptor agonist. These results point to a key role for auto-antibodies in platelet apoptosis and suggest that antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity is the mechanism underlying this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2502046372,"Phytophthora root rot caused by Phytophthora nicotianae is an economically important disease in pepper crops. The use of suppressive composts is a low environmental impact method for its control. Although attempts have been made to reveal the relationship between microbiota and compost suppressiveness, little is known about the microorganisms associated with disease suppression. Here, an Ion Torrent platform was used to assess the microbial composition of composts made of different agro-industrial waste and with different levels of suppressiveness against P. nicotianae. Both bacterial and fungal populations responded differently depending on the chemical heterogeneity of materials used during the composting process. High proportions (67-75%) of vineyard pruning waste were used in the most suppressive composts, COM-A and COM-B. This material may have promoted the presence of higher relative abundance of Ascomycota as well as higher microbial activity, which have proved to be essential for controlling the disease. Although no unique fungi or bacteria have been detected in neither suppressive nor conducive composts, relatively high abundance of Fusarium and Zopfiella were found in compost COM-B and COM-A, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies compost metabolome. Surprisingly, composts and peat clustered together in principal component analysis of the metabolic data according to their levels of suppressiveness achieved. This study demonstrated the need for combining the information provided by different techniques, including metagenomics and metametabolomics, to better understand the ability of compost to control plant diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2476387222,"Johne's disease (JD) is a chronic, intestinal infection of cattle, caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). It results in granulomatous inflammation of the intestinal lining, leading to malabsorption, diarrhea, and weight loss. Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic, inflammatory gastrointestinal disease of humans, has many clinical and pathologic similarities to JD. Dysbiosis of the enteric microbiota has been demonstrated in CD patients. It is speculated that this dysbiosis may contribute to the intestinal inflammation observed in those patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the diversity patterns of fecal bacterial populations in cattle infected with MAP, compared to those of uninfected control cattle, using phylogenomic analysis. Fecal samples were selected to include samples from 20 MAP-positive cows; 25 MAP-negative herdmates; and 25 MAP-negative cows from a MAP-free herd. The genomic DNA was extracted; PCR amplified sequenced on a 454 Roche platform, and analyzed using QIIME. Approximately 199,077 reads were analyzed from 70 bacterial communities (average of 2,843 reads/sample). The composition of bacterial communities differed between the 3 treatment groups (P < 0.001; Permanova test). Taxonomic assignment of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified 17 bacterial phyla across all samples. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes constituted more than 95% of the bacterial population in the negative and exposed groups. In the positive group, lineages of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria increased and those of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes decreased (P < 0.001). Actinobacteria was highly abundant (30% of the total bacteria) in the positive group compared to exposed and negative groups (0.1-0.2%). Notably, the genus Arthrobacter was found to predominate Actinobacteria in the positive group. This study indicates that MAP-infected cattle have a different composition of their fecal microbiota than MAP-negative cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2476494594,"Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase—protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) pathway has been considered as major drug target site due to its frequent activation in cancer. AKT regulates the activity of various targets to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been linked to oxidative stress and regulation of signaling pathways for metabolic adaptation of tumor microenvironment. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in this context is used as ROS source for oxidative stress preconditioning. Antioxidants are commonly considered to be beneficial to reduce detrimental effects of ROS and are recommended as dietary supplements. Quercetin, a ubiquitous bioactive flavonoid is a dietary component which has attracted much of interest due to its potential health-promoting effects. Present study is aimed to analyze PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in H2O2 exposed Dalton’s lymphoma ascite (DLA) cells. Further, regulation of PI3K-AKT pathway by quercetin as well as PI-103, an inhibitor of PI3K was analyzed. Exposure of H2O2 (1mM H2O2 for 30min) to DLA cells caused ROS accumulation and resulted in increased phosphorylation of PI3K and downstream proteins PDK1 and AKT (Ser-473 and Thr-308), cell survival factors BAD and ERK1/2, as well as TNFR1. However, level of tumor suppressor PTEN was declined. Both PI-103 & quercetin suppressed the enhanced level of ROS and significantly down-regulated phosphorylation of AKT, PDK1, BAD and level of TNFR1 as well as increased the level of PTEN in H2O2 induced lymphoma cells. The overall result suggests that quercetin and PI3K inhibitor PI-103 attenuate PI3K-AKT pathway in a similar mechanism."

The diversity and contribution of these bacteria to the functioning of lichen symbiosis have recently begun to be studied, often by culture-independent techniques due to difficulties in their isolation and culture. However, culturing as yet unculturable lichenic bacteria is critical to unravel their potential functional roles in lichen symbiogenesis, to explore and exploit their biotechnological potential and for the description of new taxa. Our objective was to improve the recovery of lichen associated bacteria by developing novel isolation and culture approaches, initially using the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea. We evaluated the effect of newly developed media enriched with novel lichen extracts, as well as the influence of thalli washing time and different disinfection and processing protocols of thalli. The developed methodology included: i) the use of lichen enriched media to mimic lichen nutrients, supplemented with the fungicide natamycin; ii) an extended washing of thalli to increase the recovery of ectolichenic bacteria, thus allowing the disinfection of thalli to be discarded, hence enhancing endolichenic bacteria recovery; and iii) the use of an antioxidant buffer to prevent or reduce oxidative stress during thalli disruption. The optimized methodology allowed significant increases in the number and diversity of culturable bacteria associated with P. furfuracea, and it was also successfully applied to the lichens Ramalina farinacea and Parmotrema pseudotinctorum. Furthermore, we provide, for the first time, data on the abundance of culturable ecto- and endolichenic bacteria that naturally colonize P. furfuracea, R. farinacea and P. pseudotinctorum, some of which were only able to grow on lichen enriched media. This innovative methodology is also applicable to other microorganisms inhabiting these and other lichen species."

Five years after the nuclear disaster, the radiation levels have greatly decreased due to physical decay, weathering, and decontamination operations in Fukushima. The populations of 12 communities were forced to evacuate after the accident; as of March 2016, the evacuation order has been lifted in only a limited area, and permanent habitation is still prohibited in most of the areas. In order for the government to lift the evacuation order and for individuals to return to their original residential areas, it is important to assess current and future realistic individual external doses. Here, we used personal dosimeters along with the Global Positioning System and Geographic Information System to understand realistic individual external doses and to relate individual external doses, ambient doses, and activity-patterns of individuals in the affected areas in Fukushima. The results showed that the additional individual external doses were well correlated to the additional ambient doses based on the airborne monitoring survey. The results of linear regression analysis suggested that the additional individual external doses were on average about one-fifth that of the additional ambient doses. The reduction factors, which are defined as the ratios of the additional individual external doses to the additional ambient doses, were calculated to be on average 0.14 and 0.32 for time spent at home and outdoors, respectively. Analysis of the contribution of various activity patterns to the total individual external dose demonstrated good agreement with the average fraction of time spent daily in each activity, but the contribution due to being outdoors varied widely. These results are a valuable contribution to understanding realistic individual external doses and the corresponding airborne monitoring-based ambient doses and time-activity patterns of individuals. Moreover, the results provide important information for predicting future cumulative doses after the return of residents to evacuation order areas in Fukushima."

AS1411- and control aptamers failed to control HCC cell proliferation. However, AS1411- and the modified AS1411-aptamer did not induce caspase activation. Decrease in cell growth by AS1411 or modified AS1411 was not prevented by caspase or necrosis inhibitors. In a microarray, AS1411 significantly enhanced galectin-14 expression. Suppression of HCC cell proliferation by the modified AS1411-aptamer was attenuated by galectin-14 siRNA transfection.

We test the largest sample of MT synaesthetes to date to examine two claims that have been previously made: that MT synaesthetes (1) have superior empathy; and (2) only ever experience their MT synaesthesia in response to viewing a person being touched. Given that autism has been suggested to involve deficits in cognitive empathy, we also test two predictions: that MT synaesthetes should (3) be less likely than general population individuals without MT synaesthesia to have an autism spectrum condition (ASC), if MT is characterized by superior empathy; and (4) have fewer autistic traits. We selected three groups: a pure MT synaesthesia group (N = 46), a pure grapheme-colour (GC) synaesthesia group (N = 36), and a typical control group without synaesthesia (N = 46). Participants took three measures of empathy and one measure of autistic traits. MT synaesthetes did not show enhanced empathy. In addition, 30% of all MT synaesthetes recruited into this study (N = 135) reported also having ASC, and MT synaesthetes showed higher autistic trait scores than controls. Finally, some MT experiences were reported in response to viewing objects being touched.

In addition, that nakanori treatment of epithelial cells after influenza virus infection potently inhibited virus release demonstrates the therapeutic value of targeting specific lipid domains for anti-viral treatment. —Makino, A., Abe, M., Ishitsuka, R., Murate, M., Kishimoto, T., Sakai, S., Hullin-Matsuda, F., Shimada, Y., Inaba, T., Miyatake, H., Tanaka, H., Kurahashi, A., Pack, C.-G., Kasai, R.

https://openalex.org/W2484124738,"In an effort to trace the evolution of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), S1 and ORF3 genes of viruses identified in 41 pig farms from seven regions (North, Northeast, Northwest, Central, East, South West, and South, respectively) of China in 2015 were sequenced and analyzed. Sequence analysis revealed that the 41 ORF3 genes and 29 S1 genes identified in our study exhibited nucleotide homologies of 98.2%–100% and 96.6%–100%, respectively; these two genes exhibited low nucleotide sequence similarities with classical CV777 strain and early Chinese strain LZC. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the identified PEDV strains belonged to global non S-INDEL strains, and exhibited genetic diversity; S1 gene of the HLJ2015/DP1-1 strain harbored an unique deletion of 12 nucleotides (A1130CAACTCCACTG1141); while the Chinese PEDV S-INDEL reference strains included two types of the “CV777” S-INDEL as well as the “US” S-INDEL, and all co-circulated with Chinese non S-INDEL strains. Of 29 identified S1 genes, the SS2 epitope (Y748SNIGVCK755) was highly conserved, while the SS6 epitope (L764QDGQVKI771) and pAPN receptor-binding region (aa 490–615) exhibited amino substitutions. Nine possible recombination events were identified between the 29 identifed S1 genes and the 3 S1 reference genes from early Chinese PEDV strains. The complete S genes of selected Chinese PEDV field strains (2011–2015) showed 5.18%–6.07% nucleotide divergence, which is far higher than the divergence observed in early Chinese PEDV strains (3.1%) (P<0.05). Our data provide evidence that PEDV non S-INDEL strains with genetic diversities and potential recombination circulate in seven regions of China in 2015; Chinese PEDV S-INDEL strains exhibit genetic diversity and co-circulate with non S-INDEL strains."
https://openalex.org/W2484315394,"We recently developed a mathematical model for predicting reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration and macromolecules oxidation in vivo. We constructed such a model using Escherichia coli as a model organism and a set of ordinary differential equations. In order to evaluate the major defences relative roles against hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2), we investigated the relative contributions of the various reactions to the dynamic system and searched for approximate analytical solutions for the explicit expression of changes in H2 O2 internal or external concentrations. Although the key actors in cell defence are enzymes and membrane, a detailed analysis shows that their involvement depends on the H2 O2 concentration level. Actually, the impact of the membrane upon the H2 O2 stress felt by the cell is greater when micromolar H2 O2 is present (9-fold less H2 O2 in the cell than out of the cell) than when millimolar H2 O2 is present (about 2-fold less H2 O2 in the cell than out of the cell). The ratio between maximal external H2 O2 and internal H2 O2 concentration also changes, reducing from 8 to 2 while external H2 O2 concentration increases from micromolar to millimolar. This non-linear behaviour mainly occurs because of the switch in the predominant scavenger from Ahp (Alkyl Hydroperoxide Reductase) to Cat (catalase). The phenomenon changes the internal H2 O2 maximal concentration, which surprisingly does not depend on cell density. The external H2 O2 half-life and the cumulative internal H2 O2 exposure do depend upon cell density. Based on these analyses and in order to introduce a concept of dose response relationship for H2 O2-induced cell death, we developed the concepts of ""maximal internal H2 O2 concentration"" and ""cumulative internal H2 O2 concentration"" (e.g. the total amount of H2 O2). We predict that cumulative internal H2 O2 concentration is responsible for the H2 O2-mediated death of bacterial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2483617857,"Multiple human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes often coexist within the cervical epithelia and are frequently detected together in various grades of the cervical neoplasia. To date, only a few reports exist on multiple HPV infections of HPV in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR). In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of High-Risk HPV (HR-HPV) genotypes and multiple infections. Cervical cytology samples were collected from 428 women who presented cervical abnormalities. Genotyping of HPV was performed by polymerase chain reaction-sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) using consensus primers and specific primers. Of them, 166 samples were positive for HPV according to PCR results using the consensus primers. These samples contained cervical abnormalities enriched with inflammation (n = 107), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I (n = 19), CINII-III (n = 9) and cervical cancer (n = 31). Of the 166 HPV positive samples as determined by PCR analysis, 151 were further typed by PCR-SBT using 19 pairs of genotype-specific primers. Using this method, 17 different HR-HPV genotypes were identified. The most frequently observed HPV genotypes were HPV16 (44.0%, 73/166), 53 (28.9%, 48/166), 52 (25.3%, 42/166), 58 (22.3%, 37/166) and 35 (17.5%, 29/166). The proportions of single and multiple infections in the HPV-positive specimens were 34.9% and 65.1%, respectively. Multiple HPV types were most prevalent in the inflammatory state (63.0%), followed by cervical cancer (24.1%), CINI (11.1%), and CINII-III (1.9%). The results of our data analyses suggested that i) multiple HPV infection is not necessarily correlated with the severity of cervical abnormalities; and ii) among the multiple HPV infections, double infections combined with HPV16 is the most common. In addition, L1 full-length sequences of the top five high-risk HPV genotypes were amplified and sequenced. According to the L1 sequence of the epidemic genotypes that were amplified, we found that these genotypes contained the sequence point mutation, and that some of these genotypes further showed amino acid modifications. These results provide a basis for the construction of a polyvalent vaccine that is suitable for use in the XUAR, even in economically challenged communities located in China."
https://openalex.org/W2495305125,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a common liver disorder, mostly occurring in the third trimester. ICP is defined as an elevation of serum bile acids, typically accompanied by pruritus and elevated activities of liver aminotransferases. ICP is caused by impaired biliary lipid secretion, in which endogenous steroids may play a key role. Although ICP is benign for the pregnant woman, it may be harmful for the fetus. We evaluated the differences between maternal circulating steroids measured by RIA (17-hydroxypregnenolone and its sulfate, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and cortisol) and GC-MS (additional steroids), hepatic aminotransferases and bilirubin in women with ICP (n = 15, total bile acids (TBA) >8 μM) and corresponding controls (n = 17). An age-adjusted linear model, receiver-operating characteristics (ROC), and multivariate regression (a method of orthogonal projections to latent structure, OPLS) were used for data evaluation. While aminotransferases, conjugates of pregnanediols, 17-hydroxypregnenolone and 5β-androstane-3α,17β-diol were higher in ICP patients, 20α-dihydropregnenolone, 16α-hydroxy-steroids, sulfated 17-oxo-C19-steroids, and 5β-reduced steroids were lower. The OPLS model including steroids measured by GC-MS and RIA showed 93.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while the model including steroids measured by GC-MS in a single sample aliquot showed 93.3% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity. A composite index including ratios of sulfated 3α/β-hydroxy-5α/β-androstane-17-ones to conjugated 5α/β-pregnane-3α/β, 20α-diols discriminated with 93.3% specificity and 81.3% sensitivity (ROC analysis). These new data demonstrating altered steroidogenesis in ICP patients offer more detailed pathophysiological insights into the role of steroids in the development of ICP."

Also, the diverse spectrum of pathological phenotypes depending on different mutations remains elusive. Orthologues of TSC1 and TSC2 exist in a range of eukaryotes (30Huang J. Manning B.D. The TSC1-TSC2 complex: a molecular switchboard controlling cell growth.Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), including the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum, which we used for recombinant production of TSC proteins. These proteins show increased solubility and stability as compared with mammalian homologues and are thus better suited for structural studies (31Amlacher S. Sarges P. Flemming D. van Noort V. Kunze R. Devos D.P. Arumugam M. Bork P. Hurt E. Insight into structure and assembly of the nuclear pore complex by utilizing the genome of a eukaryotic thermophile.Cell. 2011; 146: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We find that the TSC2 N terminus (TSC2-N) forms a HEAT repeat domain and interacts with the C-terminal half of TSC1 (TSC1-C). The structure helps to explain the effect of pathogenic missense mutations in tuberin (we will use TSC1/2 and hamartin/tuberin to distinguish between C. thermophilum and human proteins in the following), and we identify a point mutation that specifically blocks TSC complex formation without destroying protein folding. Our structural and biochemical characterization provides important molecular insight into TSC complex function and also represents a step forward in understanding tuberous sclerosis pathogenesis. Initial trials for recombinant expression of hamartin and tuberin in bacteria revealed problems with protein solubility and stability of the tested constructs. We then turned to TSC1 and TSC2 from the thermophilic fungus C. thermophilum, which have an identical domain organization as their mammalian counterparts (Fig. 1a) and show sequence conservation over the entire length (supplemental Fig. S1). Studies on TSC1 and TSC2 can therefore serve as a model for hamatrin and tuberin. In our efforts to characterize the structure and assembly of the TSC complex, we focused on the N terminus of TSC2/tuberin, which had been implicated in mediating the interaction with hamartin (13van Slegtenhorst M.

Identification of regions critical for the integrity of the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 complex.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e93940Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We initially expressed a construct comprising residues 70–800 of TSC2 that was designed based on primary sequence analysis (32Buchan D.W. Minneci F. Nugent T.C. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Scalable web services for the PSIPRED Protein Analysis Workbench.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: W349-WW57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). In a limited proteolysis experiment with this protein (Fig. 2a), we identified a stable and soluble proteolytic fragment of TSC2 comprising residues 70–530 (referred to as TSC2-N; Fig. 1a). When co-expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1b), a stable complex of full-length TSC1 (TSC1-fl, residues 1–820) and TSC2-N could be co-purified with affinity chromatography, showing that TSC2-N confers interaction with TSC1. In contrast, no complex between TSC1-N (1–415) and TSC2-N was observed. Note that much more TSC2-N can be purified if no TSC1 is bound, likely because of the reduced solubility of the complex compared with the isolated protein. We also observe that TSC1-fl, which is sensitive to C-terminal degradation when expressed alone, is stabilized by co-expression with TSC2-N. This is indirect evidence for TSC2-N binding to the C terminus of TSC1. Because with recombinant complex purification we were limited in the choice of fragments by the insolubility of some constructs, we further mapped the TSC1-TSC2 interaction in a cell culture system. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-TSC1 and HA-TSC2 constructs. Both full-length TSC2 (TSC2-fl) and TSC2N 70–530 bound to TSC1-fl with comparable efficiency (Fig. 1c). This confirms that the identified fragment represents the TSC1 interaction domain of TSC2. We next determined the interaction domain in TSC1 required for TSC2 association (Fig. 1d). Like hamartin, TSC1 from C. thermophilum contains a predicted N-terminal HEAT repeat domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain that are connected by a putative disordered linker. No interaction was detected between TSC1-N and full-length TSC2, but TSC1-C with and without the linker region (415–820 and 501–820, respectively) bound robustly. Additionally, we performed co-immunoprecipitations with human tuberin and hamartin and also observe that the N terminus of tuberin and the C terminus of hamartin are sufficient for complex formation (Fig. 1e). Thus, the interactions mapped are conserved for C. thermophilum proteins and the human homologues, suggesting identical complex architectures. The mapped TSC1-binding domain TSC2-N expressed well in E. coli and could be purified, yielding homogenous monomeric protein (Fig. 2b). We obtained crystals that diffracted anisotropically to 2.3 Å, and selenomethionine-substituted crystals were grown for phase determination. The model was build and refined against native data to 2.5 Å (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains four molecules with only small structural variations: molecules A and B show an rmsd of 0.016 Å, molecules C and D show an rmsd of 0.014 Å, and the rmsd between A or B versus C or D is 1.14 Å. The final models contain residues 88–527 with variable loop regions missing in the individual copies of TSC2-N because of the differential packing. Combining the information from the different copies of the asymmetric unit, we could generate a composite model lacking only the loop regions 232–242, 436–438, and 467–474 (Fig. 2, c and d). TSC2-N forms an α-solenoid, consisting of 19 helices that are arranged in nine HEAT repeats (HR) and an additional C-terminal helix. Two subdomains can be defined that are separated by a short loop between HR 6 and 7, leading to a 75° tilt of the repeats with respect to each other. HR 4 and 9 are interrupted by extensive loop sequences, with the latter one making crystal packing contact. A search with the Dali server (33Holm L. Park J.

Open table in a new tab The structure of TSC2-N from C. thermophilum can serve as model to study the function of its human homologue tuberin. We performed a multiple sequence alignment with TSC2 from C. thermophilum, S. pombe, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens (Fig. 3a and supplemental Fig. S1) The sequence identity between TSC2-N and tuberin-N is only ∼18%, but a strong similarity can be detected on the level of secondary structure. A prediction for the N terminus of tuberin (32Buchan D.W. Minneci F. Nugent T.C. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Scalable web services for the PSIPRED Protein Analysis Workbench.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: W349-WW57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 36Jones D.T. Protein secondary structure prediction based on position-specific scoring matrices.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4450) Google Scholar) shows that, like the TSC2-N domain from C. thermophilum, it is probably composed of 19 α-helices. In a multiple sequence alignment, the predicted helices in tuberin N terminus (tuberin-N, residues 40–415) match very well with the secondary structure elements observed in TSC2-N (Fig. 3a). Based on this, we generated a model for tuberin-N with SWISS-MODEL/DeepView (37Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. The SWISS-MODEL workspace: a web-based environment for protein structure homology modelling.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6025) Google Scholar, 38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL and the Swiss-PdbViewer: an environment for comparative protein modeling.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9561) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, b and c). Tuberin-N was also modeled with nine HEAT repeats and an extra C-terminal helix but lacking the extensive loop regions in HR 4 and 9. Active TSC is located on lysosomes, but its mechanism of membrane recruitment remains elusive. We generated an electrostatic potential map (39Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Electrostatics of nanosystems: application to microtubules and the ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5846) Google Scholar) of TSC2-N to identify potential membrane interaction interfaces, which often are represented by positively charged patches (Fig. 4a). Charges on TSC2-N are rather evenly distributed, with only one slightly basic patch at helix α14 that is also present at an equivalent position in tuberin-N (Fig. 4b). We did not observe a specific interaction of TSC2-N with a particular lipid in a protein lipid overlay assay (Fig. 4c). However, in a liposome sedimentation assay, TSC2-N bound specifically to a vacuolar lipid mix, but not to liposomes composed of neutral lipids (Fig. 4, d and e). The vacuolar SNARE Vam7, which binds to phosphoinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) via a PX domain, served as a positive control, and TSC2-N binding to liposomes was inefficient in comparison. This indicates that TSC2-N has a weak affinity for negatively charged membranes. To identify putative functionally important surface patches on TSC2-N, we mapped conserved residues on the structure (Fig. 5a). Most conserved residues are located in the interior of the protein and involved in stabilizing the domain fold. In addition, an accumulation of conserved residues can be found at the base of HEAT repeats 3–5, highlighting a potential functional interface (Fig. 5a). To test whether this interface might represent the binding site for TSC1 on TSC2-N, we designed three sets of mutations of conserved surface residues (set 1: K263E, F264A, and F307A; set2: N194A and D260A; and set 3: P159T and R166A). There was no negative influence on the overall structure and stability of these mutants in comparison with wild-type TSC2-N detectable by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 5b) or differential scanning fluorimetry (Fig. 5c). The co-purification of TSC1 was impaired with the set 3 mutant (Fig. 5, d and e), suggesting that these residues play a role in mediating the contact between TSC1 and TSC2. More than 2200 unique mutations in the TSC2 gene are reported in the tuberous sclerosis database of the Leiden Open Variation Database (29Fokkema I.F. Taschner P.E. Schaafsma G.C. Celli J. Laros J.F. den Dunnen J.T. LOVD v.2.0: the next generation in gene variant databases.Hum. Mutat. 2011; 32: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). We searched the database for missense point mutations reported or concluded as pathogenic or probably pathogenic and mapping to the region covered by our structure. Deletion, insertion, frame shifts, and stop mutations that likely lead to misfolded protein were excluded. The search yielded a list of 33 mutations (Table 2), which can be mapped on the model of tuberin-N and classified by their likely effect on protein structure (Fig. 6a). Six of the identified mutations (shown in green) do map to the surface of tuberin-N and should not affect folding. Such mutations can be suspected to interfere with molecular functions of tuberin, like its interaction with hamartin. In contrast, 11 changes (labeled in red) are of residues located in α-helices to proline. Such substitutions will be helix-breaking, might destroy the secondary structure, and might lead to destabilized or misfolded protein. Another class of structural mutants could affect intramolecular packing (labeled in yellow): exchange of residues that constitute the hydrophobic core of tuberin-N to amino acids with side chains of different shape or polarity also leads to destabilization and/or partial unfolding of the domain. Although amino acid changes in the protein core can be tolerated to some extent, we suggest that the disease-causing effect of these structural mutations could be explained by improper folding of tuberin-N and, consequently, dysfunctional protein.TABLE 2Pathogenic point mutations in the tuberin N-terminusMutation tuberin-NPosition CtTSC2-NStructural classificationBiophysical characterizationR57HSer104Surface-exposed residueE7 GLeu122Surface-exposed residueSoluble, stableV126FThr172Intramolecular packingL146RLeu192Intramolecular packingSoluble, ins"
https://openalex.org/W2493363156,"Over the last decade, ocean sunfish movements have been monitored worldwide using various satellite tracking methods. This study reports the near-real time monitoring of fine-scale (< 10 m) behaviour of sunfish. The study was conducted in southern Portugal in May 2014 and involved satellite tags and underwater and surface robotic vehicles to measure both the movements and the contextual environment of the fish. A total of four individuals were tracked using custom-made GPS satellite tags providing geolocation estimates of fine-scale resolution. These accurate positions further informed sunfish areas of restricted search (ARS), which were directly correlated to steep thermal frontal zones. Simultaneously, and for two different occasions, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) video-recorded the path of the tracked fish and detected buoyant particles in the water column. Importantly, the densities of these particles were also directly correlated to steep thermal gradients. Thus, both sunfish foraging behaviour (ARS) and possibly prey densities, were found to be influenced by analogous environmental conditions. In addition, the dynamic structure of the water transited by the tracked individuals was described by a Lagrangian modelling approach. The model informed the distribution of zooplankton in the region, both horizontally and in the water column, and the resultant simulated densities positively correlated with sunfish ARS behaviour estimator (rs = 0.184, p<0.001). The model also revealed that tracked fish opportunistically displace with respect to subsurface current flow. Thus, we show how physical forcing and current structure provide a rationale for a predator's fine-scale behaviour observed over a two weeks in May 2014."

https://openalex.org/W2505411178,"The poor prognosis of patients who experience ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after breast conserving surgery (BCS) is established. A short time between primary cancer and IBTR is a prognostic factor but no clinically relevant threshold was determined. Classification of IBTR may help tailor treatment strategies.We determined a specific time frame, which differentiates IBTR into early and late recurrence, and identified prognostic factors for patients with IBTR at time of the recurrence.We analyzed 2209 patients with IBTR after BCS. We applied the optimal cut-points method for survival data to determine the cut-off times to IBTR. A subgroup analysis was performed by hormone receptor (HR) status. Survival analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazard model to determine clinical features associated with distant-disease-free survival (DDFS) after IBTR. We therefor built decision trees.On the 828 metastatic events observed, the majority occurred within the first 3 months after IBTR: 157 in the HR positive group, 98 in the HR negative group. We found different prognostic times to IBTR: 49 months in the HR positive group, 33 in the HR negative group. After multivariate analysis, time to IBTR was the first discriminant prognostic factor in both groups (HR 0.65 CI95% [0.54-0.79] and 0.42 [0.30-0.57] respectively). The other following variables were significantly correlated with the DDFS: the initial number of positive lymph nodes for both groups, the initial tumor size and grade for HR positive tumors.A short interval time to IBTR is the strongest factor of poor prognosis and reflects occult distant disease. It would appear that prognosis after IBTR depends more on clinical and histological parameters than on surgical treatment. A prospective trial in a low-risk group of patients to validate the safety of salvage BCS instead of mastectomy in IBTR is needed."

The aim of this study is to differentiate the effects of drying alone from the effects of the successive and necessary rehydration. Rehydration of dried bacteria is a critical step already studied in starter culture but not for different kinetics and not for pathogens. In the present study, the influence of rehydration kinetics was investigated for three foodborne pathogens involved in neonatal diseases caused by the consumption of rehydrated milk powder: Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Senftenberg and Cronobacter sakazakii. Bacteria were dried in controlled relative humidity atmospheres and then rehydrated using different methods. Our results showed that the survival of the three pathogens was strongly related to rehydration kinetics. Consequently, rehydration is an important step to consider during food safety assessment or during studies of dried foodborne pathogens. Also, it has to be considered with more attention in consumers' homes during the preparation of food, like powdered infant formula, to avoid pathogens recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2492130573,"Rhythmic incremental growth lines and the presence of melatonin receptors were discovered in tooth enamel, suggesting possible role of circadian rhythm. We therefore hypothesized that circadian rhythm may regulate enamel formation through melatonin receptors. To test this hypothesis, we examined expression of melatonin receptors (MTs) and amelogenin (AMELX), a maker of enamel formation, during tooth germ development in mouse. Using qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, we found that mRNA and protein levels of both MTs and AMELX in normal mandibular first molar tooth germs increased gradually after birth, peaked at 3 or 4 day postnatal, and then decreased. Expression of MTs and AMELX by immunocytochemistry was significantly delayed in neonatal mice raised in all-dark or all-light environment as well as the enamel development. Furthermore, development of tooth enamel was also delayed showing significant immature histology in those animals, especially for newborn mice raised in all daylight condition. Interestingly, disruption in circadian rhythm in pregnant mice also resulted in delayed enamel development in their babies. Treatment with melatonin receptor antagonist 4P-PDOT in pregnant mice caused underexpression of MTs and AMELX associated with long-lasting deficiency in baby enamel tissue. Electromicroscopic evidence demonstrated increased necrosis and poor enamel mineralization in ameloblasts. The above results suggest that circadian rhythm is important for normal enamel development at both pre- and postnatal stages. Melatonin receptors were partly responsible for the regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2493684481,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in many regions of the world and is one of the most prevalent epizootic animal diseases. FMD affects livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, and causes enormous economic losses due to reduced productivity and trade restrictions. Preparedness and early diagnosis are essential for effective control of FMD. Many diagnostic assays are dependent on raising high-affinity, anti-FMD virus (FMDV) serotype-specific antibodies in small animals (rabbits and guinea pigs) that give broad virus coverage. Here we show that soluble, truncated forms of bovine αvβ6 bind FMDV in an authentic RGD and divalent cation dependent interaction and can be used as the trapping reagent in a FMDV sandwich ELISA. In addition, inclusion of FLAG or His tags facilitates simple purification without the loss of virus binding. We also provide evidence that when combined with a guinea pig polyclonal serum, or serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies, the integrin can be used to detect viruses representative of all FMDV serotypes. We also show that recombinant FMDV empty capsids, with stabilising disulphide bonds, can serve as an antigen in the ELISA and can therefore replace inactivated virus antigen as a positive control for the assay. Our results demonstrate the potential use of bovine αvβ6 and FMDV empty capsids in FMD diagnostic assays."
https://openalex.org/W2505188169,"Inbreeding and relatedness in wild panda populations are important parameters for panda conservation. Habitat loss and fragmentation are expected to increase inbreeding but the actual inbreeding levels in natural panda habitats were unknown. Using 150,025 SNPs and 14,926 SNPs selected from published whole-genome sequences, we estimated genomic inbreeding coefficients and relatedness of 49 pandas including 34 wild pandas sampled from six habitats. Qinling and Liangshan pandas had the highest levels of inbreeding and relatedness measured by genomic inbreeding and coancestry coefficients, whereas the inbreeding levels in Qionglai and Minshan were 28–45% of those in Qinling and Liangshan. Genomic coancestry coefficients between pandas from different habitats showed that panda populations from the four largest habitats, Minshan, Qionglai, Qinling and Liangshan, were genetically unrelated. Pandas between these four habitats on average shared 66.0–69.1% common alleles and 45.6–48.6% common genotypes, whereas pandas within each habitat shared 71.8–77.0% common alleles and 51.7–60.4% common genotypes. Pandas in the smaller populations of Qinling and Liangshan were more similarly to each other than pandas in the larger populations of Qionglai and Minshan according to three genomic similarity measures. Panda genetic differentiation between these habitats was positively related to their geographical distances. Most pandas separated by 200 kilometers or more shared no common ancestral alleles. The results provided a genomic quantification of the actual levels of inbreeding and relatedness among pandas in their natural habitats, provided genomic confirmation of the relationship between genetic diversity and geographical distances, and provided genomic evidence to the urgency of habitat protection."

We employed a monoclonal antibody (mAb 659) specific for the unique and intact thrombin-sensitive site in OPN using an inhibition ELISA. We found significantly higher levels of OPN in 33 cervical cancer patients in both the plasma (mean +/- SD, 612 +/- 106 ng/mL) and serum (424 +/- 121 ng/mL) compared to healthy subjects [409 +/- 56 ng/mL, from 31 plasma samples (P < 0.0001), and 314 +/- 98 ng/mL, from 32 serum samples (P = 0.0002), respectively]. Similar results were obtained when the plasma from a bigger group (147 individuals) of cervical cancer patients (560 +/- 211 ng/mL) were compared with the same plasma samples of the healthy individuals (P = 0.0014). More significantly, the OPN level was highest in stage III-IV disease (614 +/- 210 ng/mL, from 52 individuals; P = 0.0001) and least and non-discriminatory in stage I (473 +/- 110 ng/mL, from 40 individuals; P = 0.5318). No such discrimination was found when a mAb of a different specificity (mAb 446) was used in a similar inhibition ELISA to compare the two groups in the first study; a commercial capture ELISA also failed. The possibility that the target epitope recognized by the antibody probe in these assays was absent from the circulating OPN due to protein truncation was supported by gel fractionation of the OPN found in patients’ plasma: 60–64 kDa fragments were found instead of the presumably full-length OPN (68 kDa) seen in healthy people. How these fragments are generated and what possible role they play in cancer biology remain interesting questions."
https://openalex.org/W2480831003,"The recent emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America highlights vulnerability to climate sensitive diseases and stresses the importance of preventive efforts to reduce their public health impact. Effective prevention involves reducing environmental risk of exposure and increasing adoption of preventive behaviours, both of which depend on knowledge and acceptance of such measures. When making operational decisions about disease prevention and control, public health must take into account a wide range of operational, environmental, social and economic considerations in addition to intervention effectiveness. The current study aimed to identify, assess and rank possible risk reduction measures taking into account a broad set of criteria and perspectives applicable to the management of WNV in Quebec under increasing transmission risk scenarios, some of which may be related to ongoing warming in higher-latitude regions. A participatory approach was used to collect information on categories of concern to relevant stakeholders with respect to WNV prevention and control. Multi-criteria decision analysis was applied to examine stakeholder perspectives and their effect on strategy rankings under increasing transmission risk scenarios. Twenty-three preventive interventions were retained for evaluation using eighteen criteria identified by stakeholders. Combined evaluations revealed that, at an individual-level, inspecting window screen integrity, wearing light colored, long clothing, eliminating peridomestic larval sites and reducing outdoor activities at peak times were top interventions under six WNV transmission scenarios. At a regional-level, the use of larvicides was a preferred strategy in five out of six scenarios, while use of adulticides and dissemination of sterile male mosquitoes were found to be among the least favoured interventions in almost all scenarios. Our findings suggest that continued public health efforts aimed at reinforcing individual-level preventive behaviours combined with the application of larvicides to manage the risk of WNV infection are the interventions most acceptable and effective at reaching current management objectives now and under future theoretical transmission risk."
https://openalex.org/W2483475494,"Cooperation is pervasive and constitutes the core behavioral principle of human social life. Previous studies have revealed that mutual cooperation was reliably correlated with two reward-related brain regions, the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study sought to investigate how the loss and gain contexts modulated the neural responses to mutual cooperation. Twenty-five female participants were scanned when they played a series of one-shot prisoner's dilemma games in the loss and gain contexts. Specifically, participants and partners independently chose to either cooperate with each other or not, and each was awarded or deprived of (in the gain context or the loss context, respectively) a sum of money which depended upon the interaction of their choices. Behavioral results indicated that participants cooperated in nearly half of the experiment trials and reported higher level of positive emotions for mutual cooperation in both contexts, but they cooperated more in the gain than in the loss context. At the neural level, stronger activities in the orbitofrontal cortex were observed for mutual cooperation compared with the other three outcomes in both contexts, while stronger activation in ventral striatum associated with mutual cooperation was observed in the gain context only. Together, our data indicated that, even in the one-shot interaction under loss context, participants still exhibited preference for cooperation and the rewarding experience from a mutually cooperative social interaction activated the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex, but the loss context weakened the association between the ventral striatum activation and mutual cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W2493457796,"Understanding the stability of chloropyromorphite (CPY) is of considerable benefit for improving risk assessment and remediation strategies in contaminated water and soil. The stability of CPY in the rhizosphere of phosphorus-deficient ryegrass was evaluated to elucidate the role of root-secreted low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) on the dissolution of CPY. Results showed that CPY treatments significantly reduced the ryegrass biomass and rhizosphere pH. The presence of calcium nitrate extractable lead (Pb) and phosphorus (P) suggested that CPY in the rhizosphere could be bioavailable, because P and Pb uptake by ryegrass potentially provided a significant concentration gradient that would promote CPY dissolution. Pb accumulation and translocation in ryegrass was found to be significantly higher in P-sufficient conditions than in P-deficient conditions. CPY treatments significantly enhanced root exudation of LMWOAs irrigated with P-nutrient solution or P-free nutrient solution. Oxalic acid was the dominant species in root-secreted LMWOAs of ryegrass under P-free nutrient solution treatments, suggesting that root-secreted oxalic acid may be the driving force of root-induced dissolution of CPY. Hence, our work, provides clarifying hints on the role of LMWOAs in controlling the stability of CPY in the rhizosphere."

Finally, our work suggests a more general role of the histidine residue in the transport of copper by PIB-1-ATPases. Copper is an essential micronutrient involved in many cellular processes. However, because of its redox properties, copper is also highly toxic when present in excess, and thus its homeostasis in the cell is finely tuned thanks to a complex network of processes involving acquisition, storage, and transport. This tuning is especially crucial in the chloroplast where, under high light condition, electrons can escape from the photosynthetic machinery and directly reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. The presence of free copper would convert these molecules into the highly toxic hydroxyl radical (OH•) through the Haber-Weiss cycle (1Ravet K. Pilon M. Copper and iron homeostasis in plants: the challenges of oxidative stress.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 19: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In plant, copper is the cofactor of proteins involved in key cellular functions like the cytochrome c oxidase for respiration in mitochondria and plastocyanin for photosynthesis in chloroplasts. Plastocyanin, one of the most abundant plant cuproproteins, allows the transfer of photosynthetic electrons between cytochrome b6f and photosystem I. It is located in the thylakoid lumen, where it acquires copper (2Li H.M. Theg S.M. Bauerle C.M. Keegstra K. Metal-ion-center assembly of ferredoxin and plastocyanin in isolated chloroplasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 6748-6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Copper delivery to apoplastocyanin involves two transporters of the P-ATPases family, HMA6 and HMA8, located at the chloroplast envelope (3Ferro M. Salvi D. Brugière S. Miras S. Kowalski S.

HMA6 and HMA8 loss of function mutations strongly reduce chloroplast copper content, in the stroma for the hma6 mutant and in thylakoids for the hma8 mutant. Consequently, the activity of the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase in the stroma is reduced in the hma6 mutant, and plastocyanin-dependent photosynthetic electron transfer in the thylakoids is reduced in both mutants (4Shikanai T.

Several steps of copper transport from the cytosol to the lumen of thylakoids have been identified. The copper chaperone PCH1, located in the intermembrane space of the chloroplast envelope, could bring copper to HMA6 (7Blaby-Haas C.E. Padilla-Benavides T. Stübe R. Argüello J.M. Merchant S.S.

Plant. 2009; 2: 1336-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). So far, the mechanism of copper transfer from HMA8 to plastocyanin is not known. However, combining enzymatic and structural approaches, we proposed that the two proteins could have favorable electrostatic interactions allowing a direct copper transfer without requirement of a metallochaperone (9Sautron E. Mayerhofer H. Giustini C. Pro D. Crouzy S. Ravaud S. Pebay-Peyroula E. Rolland N. Catty P. Seigneurin-Berny D. HMA6 and HMA8 are two chloroplast Cu+-ATPases with different enzymatic properties.Biosci. Rep. 2015; 35: e00201Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As for HMA6 and CCS, the interaction between HMA8 and plastocyanin needs to be experimentally validated. P-ATPases form a large family of transmembrane proteins that translocate ions or lipids across membranes thanks to the hydrolysis of ATP (13Kühlbrandt W. Biology, structure and mechanism of P-type ATPases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). P-ATPases are divided into five subfamilies of different transport specificities. HMA6 and HMA8 belong to the PIB-ATPases subfamily, which gathers heavy metal ions transporting P-ATPases. In this subfamily, they are classified as PIB-1-ATPases corresponding to Cu+/Ag+-ATPases (14Argüello J.M. Identification of ion-selectivity determinants in heavy-metal transport P1B-type ATPases.J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 15Smith A.T. Smith K.P. Rosenzweig A.C. Diversity of the metal-transporting P1B-type ATPases.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2014; 19: 947-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PIB-1-ATPases display the same core topology as other P-ATPases with six transmembrane segments (TM1–TM6) 4The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment; BCA, bicinchoninic acid; BCS, bathocuproine disulfonate; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration. and three cytoplasmic domains constituting the catalytic moiety of the transporter (A, N, and P). However, PIB-1-ATPases have unique features like one to six cytoplasmic metal-binding domains and two supplementary transmembrane helices at their N-terminal part (TMA and TMB; Fig. 1A). TMB is a kinked helix displaying an amphipathic platform that would serve as a docking interface for the copper chaperone (16Gourdon P. Liu X.Y. Skjørringe T. Morth J.P. Møller L.B. Pedersen B.P. Nissen P. Crystal structure of a copper-transporting PIB-type ATPase.Nature. 2011; 475: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 17Gourdon P. Sitsel O. Lykkegaard Karlsen J. Birk Møller L. Nissen P. Structural models of the human copper P-type ATPases ATP7A and ATP7B.Biol. Chem. 2012; 393: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle of a PIB-ATPase is a four-step process (Fig. 1B) characterized by the formation of a transient phosphorylated intermediate on a conserved aspartate residue of the DKTGT motif (13Kühlbrandt W. Biology, structure and mechanism of P-type ATPases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 18Palmgren M.G. Nissen P. P-type ATPases.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 40: 243-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In its free state (E2), the ATPase binds metal (Me.E1) from the cytoplasm (or from the stroma for HMA8) at its high affinity transport site in the membrane domain (step 1). ATP bound to the large cytoplasmic domain of the transporter is then hydrolyzed, leading to the formation of a phosphorylated enzyme (step 2). The metal-bound phosphorylated state of the enzyme (Me.E1∼P) undergoes conformation changes leading to metal release at the other side of the membrane (step 3). In the metal-free phosphorylated enzyme (E2-P), the aspartyl phosphate bond is then hydrolyzed to return the enzyme to its free state (E2; step 4). As we demonstrated for HMA6 (8Catty P. Boutigny S. Miras R. Joyard J. Rolland N. Seigneurin-Berny D. Biochemical characterization of AtHMA6/PAA1, a chloroplast envelope Cu(I)-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36188-36197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), P-ATPases can be phosphorylated from inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the reverse order (step 4). Although phosphorylation from ATP requires metal binding to the transporter, phosphorylation from Pi only occurs on the metal-free state of the ATPase. Involving a simple equilibrium reaction (and not the whole catalytic cycle), phosphorylation from Pi affords greater precision in calculating the affinity of the ATPase for the transported ion. In the last few years, biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies have provided significant insights into the transport mechanism of Cu-ATPases. It is now widely believed that the copper chaperone would transfer copper to the ATPase by docking with the amphipathic platform created by the TMB kink, through the formation of transient complexes involving amino acids from both proteins (19González-Guerrero M.

Relocation of the copper ion to the high affinity transport site would involve copper coordination exchanges between amino acids constituting the entry site and cysteine residues of the conserved CPC motif in TM4 and the methionine residue of the conserved MX2SS motif in TM6. In LpCopA, the high affinity transport site comprises the cysteine residues Cys382 and Cys384 and the methionine residue Met717. On the other hand, the mechanism of copper release from the PIB-1-ATPases and its transfer to final acceptors is less documented. Studies of CopA from Escherichia coli (23Padilla-Benavides T.

These results also suggested that the functional difference between the highly homologous ATP7A and ATP7B proteins could be explained by the nature of the amino acids present in the L1 (the L1 loop of ATP7A is particularly enriched in histidine and methionine residues as compared with ATP7B). In LpCopA, the release site would be composed of the glutamate residue Glu89 in TM2 and the two methionine residues Met100 and Met711 in TMA and TM6, respectively. In Arabidopsis chloroplasts, the two Cu-ATPases HMA6 and HMA8 act sequentially to deliver copper in the thylakoid lumen for the maturation of plastocyanin. However, because of their distinct localization patterns in chloroplast membranes, the two ATPases are thought to interact with different partners and to have distinct functions. Indeed, HMA6 is thought to interact with different chaperones to provide copper to the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and to HMA8 (5Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T.

Abdel-Ghany S.E. Cohu C.M. Pilon M. Copper homeostasis.New Phytol. 2009; 182: 799-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The latter could interact directly with plastocyanin (9Sautron E. Mayerhofer H. Giustini C. Pro D. Crouzy S. Ravaud S. Pebay-Peyroula E. Rolland N. Catty P. Seigneurin-Berny D. HMA6 and HMA8 are two chloroplast Cu+-ATPases with different enzymatic properties.Biosci. Rep. 2015; 35: e00201Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In both case, the interaction between the ATPase and its recipient protein has not been experimentally confirmed. To identify residues of HMA6 and HMA8 involved in copper release, we first compared the TMA-L1-TMB region of Cu-ATPases from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This allowed us to point out the presence of a unique cysteine- and histidine-rich sequence containing the conserved CX3HX2H motif, exclusively found in Cu-ATPases localized in chloroplasts of eukaryotic organisms (plant and algae). Through a structure/function study using expression in yeast and in vitro biochemical characterization of mutated proteins after expression in Lactococcus lactis, we identified two critical residues, a cysteine and a histidine, involved in copper release. From this work, we propose a metal pathway through the membrane domain of HMA6 and HMA8, and highlight some structural differences that exist between Cu-ATPases from plant and bacteria. In addition, our work suggests a more general, and so far unknown, role of the histidine residue in copper transport by PIB-1-ATPases. To identify residues specifically involved in copper release during the catalytic cycle of chloroplast Cu-ATPases, we compared the primary sequence corresponding to the TMA-L1-TMB region of 140 PIB-1-ATPases from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This comparison allowed the identification of 66 unique sequences containing relatively well conserved proline, cysteine, histidine, or methionine residues in the TMA-L1-TMB region. From this analysis, it was not possible to find a unique motif shared by all the Cu-ATPases but rather three homology groups. Group A comprises sequences with a conserved proline residue in TMA, a predominance of methionine residues at the TMA-L1 junction, and histidine residues exclusively found in the L1 loop (Fig. 2A). In this group, only very few sequences contain cysteine residues in TMA. Within this group are the well characterized Cu-ATPases CopA from bacteria, Ccc2p from yeast, and the human ATP7A and ATP7B. Group B and C sequences differ from group A sequences by the absence of a proline residue in TMA. Group B sequences, exclusively found in bacteria, are characterized by an enrichment in methionine residues in TMA and a conserved histidine residue in the L1 loop (Fig. 2B). Group C sequences are enriched in cysteine and histidine residues and display a strongly conserved CX3HX2H motif (Fig. 2C). This group comprises Cu-ATPases like HMA6 and HMA8, localized in the chloroplast membranes of photosynthetic eukaryotes (algae and plant). Note that the two other plant Cu-ATPases, HMA5 and HMA7, localized at the plasma and ER membranes, respectively, are found in the group A in agreement with a recent phylogenetic study on the classification on Cu-ATPases (27Hanikenne M. Baurain D. Origin and evolution of metal P-type ATPases in Plantae (Archaeplastida).Front. Plant Sci. 2013; 4: 544PubMed Google Scholar). To more accurately model the positioning of the conserved histidine and cysteine residues in the TMA-L1-TMB region, we generated three-dimensional models of HMA6 and HMA8 from the crystal structure of the L. pneumophila Cu-ATPase LpCopA as described in Ref. 9Sautron E.

HMA6 and HMA8 are two chloroplast Cu+-ATPases with different enzymatic properties.Biosci. Rep. 2015; 35: e00201Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar (Fig. 3). This in silico analysis allowed us to identify seven putative residues in HMA6 (two cysteines and five histidines, some of them belonging to the CX3HX2H motif), which may participate in copper release. In our previous studies, we have shown that yeast is a useful tool for the functional characterization of plant PIB-ATPases, among them the chloroplast PIB-ATPases HMA1, HMA6, and HMA8 (8Catty P.

Indeed, expression of an active form of these ATPases induces growth arrest provided that the transported metal is present in the culture medium at the adequate concentration. We have shown that, for HMA6 and HMA8, the phenotype is linked to the localization of the transporters at the ER membrane and toxic accumulation of metal in this compartment (9Sautron E.

The case of HMA6 is particularly illustrative: expression of the active form of the transporter induces yeast growth arrest at 0.5 mm copper, whereas a strain expressing HMA6-AKT (an inactive form of HMA6 mutated in the phosphorylation site) tolerates up to 1.4 mm copper (Fig. 4 and Ref. 8Catty P.

This range of copper concentration allows us to accurately assess the copper sensitivity of strains expressing targeted mutants of HMA6 in the TMA-L1-TMB region and establish a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).FIGURE 4.Functional expression of HMA6 and HMA8 mutants in yeast. A, MIC of copper observed for each yeast strain expressing the different forms of HMA6 and HMA8. Mutants affecting yeast sensitivity to copper as compared with the native protein are indicated in bold. B, yeast strains expressing HMA6 and HMA6 mutants (AKT, C161A, H165A, and C161A/H165A) were grown on selective media supplemented with copper at the indicated concentrations. For each expression condition, two independent transformants were spotted at dilutions 1 and 1/10, as 2-μl drops (only one transformant is shown). Dilution 1 corresponds to an optical density of 1.5 at 600 nm. EV, empty vector. C, expression of HMA6 and HMA6 mutants (AKT, C161A, H165A, and C161A/H165A) in yeast membranes was revealed by Western blotting using a Strep-tactin HRP conjugate. D, phenotypic tests as described in B for yeast strains expressing HMA8 and HMA8 mutants (AKT, C189A, H193A, and C189A/H193A). E, expression of HMA8 and HMA8 mutants (AKT, C189A, H193A, and C189A/H193A) in yeast membranes was revealed by Western blotting using a Strep-tactin HRP conjugate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Each of the seven candidate residues in HMA6 were mutated and expressed in their mature forms (i.e. without the chloroplast transit peptide) and with a Strep-tag II fused at their C terminus. As shown in Fig. 4A, yeast strains expressing the C158A, H168A, H178A, H181A, and H186A mutants behave like a strain expressing the native form of HMA6, with a MIC of 0.5 mm copper, suggesting that these mutations have no impact on the activity of the transporter. This is not the case for the mutations of the His165 and Cys161 residues. Indeed, a strain expressing the H165A mutant displays a MIC of 1.2 mm copper close to that of strains containing the empty vector or expressing the inactive HMA6-AKT protein (Fig. 4, A and B). A strain expressing the C161A mutant displays a lower sensitivity to copper as compared with the strain expressing the native form of HMA6 (MIC of 0.8 and 0.5 mm copper, respectively). Importantly, the copper sensitivity of a strain expressing the double mutant C161A/H165A is similar to that of a strain expressing H165A, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of single mutations are not cumulative and that the H165A mutation is phenotypically “dominant.” Because the copper sensitivity of the strain is a result of the concentration of copper accumulated in the organism, we assessed whether the wild type and mutants showed differences in protein abundance. Applying the Michaelis-Menten concept, a lower amount of the transporter might require more copper to produce the same inhibitory effect. If the Cys161 and His165 mutants had the same enzymatic properties of HMA6, a lower amount of these proteins in yeast would displace their corresponding MIC toward higher concentrations. To check this, we have assessed the amount of the different HMA6 forms in yeast by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4C, the C161A, H165A, and C161A/H165A mutants are more abundant than HMA6. Hence, one can exclude the possibility that the lower sensitivity to copper induced by these mutants is due to a lower expression level in yeast. Note that the other mutants were all expressed at the same level as HMA6 (data not shown). Phenotypes might also be linked to intracellular localization of the expressed proteins. We thus localized the different forms of HMA6 in yeast using GFP fusions and checked the expression level, as well as the phenotype induced by these new forms of HMA6. As shown in Fig. 5A, all mutants are expressed in intracellular structures similar to the ones described for HMA6 (9Sautron E. Mayerhofer H. Giustini C. Pro D. Crouzy S. Ravaud S. Pebay-Peyroula E. Rolland N. Catty P. Seigneurin-Berny D. HMA6 and HMA8 are two chloroplast Cu+-ATPases with different enzymatic properties.Biosci. Rep. 2015; 35: e00201Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Critically, the addition of GFP has no impact on the phenotype because copper MICs of strains expressing either the mutant or mutant-GFP fusion are identical (Fig. 4A). In conclusion, these phenotypic tests allowed us to identify two residues, Cys161 and His165, which could have an important role on the enzymatic properties of HMA6. HMA8 displays similar sequence features as HMA6: a CX3HX2H motif at the TMA-L1 junction (Fig. 2C) and several histidine residues in the L1 loop and in TMB. Remarkably, HM"
