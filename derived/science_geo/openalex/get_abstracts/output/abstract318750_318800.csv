https://openalex.org/W2053224162,"The uptake and distribution of carbon-14 in two reef-building corals, Manicina areolata and Montastrea annularis, were studied by radioautographic methods. Experiments on colonies with and without zooxanthellae were run in light and in darkness. We suggest that corals cannot derive any effective nutrition from their zooxanthellae, and that the physiological response of corals to the presence of zooxanthellae is due to the secretion of trace amounts of vitamin-like or hormone-like substances by the algal symbionts, and not to their food value per se."
https://openalex.org/W2142033851,The inhibition of indoleacetic acid oxidase activity by chlorogenic acid is markedly variable. Aqueous extracts of acetone precipitates from etiolated pea epicotyls contain heat-stable substances which decrease the inhibition produced by chlorogenic acid and also have a small activating effect. Low concentrations of pcoumaric acid (1 micro/ml) can stimulate this action. The possible role of activators and inhibitors in the in vivo regulation of indoleacetic acid oxidase activity is discussed.

Attempts to show graft transmission of male fertility also failed. Evidently transmission of cytoplasmic male sterility through a graft union with a fertile individual is not an easily repeatable or else is not a general phenomenon in plants."

Analyses of several fractions of a graywacke indicate what each contributes chemically to the rock."

https://openalex.org/W1999346953,A method is described for the preparation of soil extracts for analysis which eliminates filtration. The procedure is based on the flocculating characteristics of very small amounts of polyacrylamides on inorganic and organic colloids. Amounts of plant nutrients extracted from soils by this method compare favorably with those obtained in filtered soil extracts.

As an example, a temperature curve for the synthesis of galena (PbS) is given. Similarly derived temperatures of formation for eight other synthetic sulfides and selenides are reported."
