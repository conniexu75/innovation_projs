https://openalex.org/W2999044305,"Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7. AlphaFold predicts the distances between pairs of residues, is used to construct potentials of mean force that accurately describe the shape of a protein and can be optimized with gradient descent to predict protein structures."
https://openalex.org/W2998795792,"Treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer therapy. Until now, predictive biomarkers1-10 and strategies to augment clinical response have largely focused on the T cell compartment. However, other immune subsets may also contribute to anti-tumour immunity11-15, although these have been less well-studied in ICB treatment16. A previously conducted neoadjuvant ICB trial in patients with melanoma showed via targeted expression profiling17 that B cell signatures were enriched in the tumours of patients who respond to treatment versus non-responding patients. To build on this, here we performed bulk RNA sequencing and found that B cell markers were the most differentially expressed genes in the tumours of responders versus non-responders. Our findings were corroborated using a computational method (MCP-counter18) to estimate the immune and stromal composition in this and two other ICB-treated cohorts (patients with melanoma and renal cell carcinoma). Histological evaluation highlighted the localization of B cells within tertiary lymphoid structures. We assessed the potential functional contributions of B cells via bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, which demonstrate clonal expansion and unique functional states of B cells in responders. Mass cytometry showed that switched memory B cells were enriched in the tumours of responders. Together, these data provide insights into the potential role of B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures in the response to ICB treatment, with implications for the development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

https://openalex.org/W3000282923,"Soft-tissue sarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of cancer, with more than 50 histological subtypes1,2. The clinical presentation of patients with different subtypes is often atypical, and responses to therapies such as immune checkpoint blockade vary widely3,4. To explain this clinical variability, here we study gene expression profiles in 608 tumours across subtypes of soft-tissue sarcoma. We establish an immune-based classification on the basis of the composition of the tumour microenvironment and identify five distinct phenotypes: immune-low (A and B), immune-high (D and E), and highly vascularized (C) groups. In situ analysis of an independent validation cohort shows that class E was characterized by the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures that contain T cells and follicular dendritic cells and are particularly rich in B cells. B cells are the strongest prognostic factor even in the context of high or low CD8+ T cells and cytotoxic contents. The class-E group demonstrated improved survival and a high response rate to PD1 blockade with pembrolizumab in a phase 2 clinical trial. Together, this work confirms the immune subtypes in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, and unravels the potential of B-cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures to guide clinical decision-making and treatments, which could have broader applications in other diseases. Immune profiling of the tumour microenvironment of soft-tissue sarcoma identifies a group of patients with high levels of B-cell infiltration and tertiary lymphoid structures that have improved survival and a high response rate to immune checkpoint blockade therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2999376388,"The origin of eukaryotes remains unclear1-4. Current data suggest that eukaryotes may have emerged from an archaeal lineage known as 'Asgard' archaea5,6. Despite the eukaryote-like genomic features that are found in these archaea, the evolutionary transition from archaea to eukaryotes remains unclear, owing to the lack of cultured representatives and corresponding physiological insights. Here we report the decade-long isolation of an Asgard archaeon related to Lokiarchaeota from deep marine sediment. The archaeon-'Candidatus Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum' strain MK-D1-is an anaerobic, extremely slow-growing, small coccus (around 550 nm in diameter) that degrades amino acids through syntrophy. Although eukaryote-like intracellular complexes have been proposed for Asgard archaea6, the isolate has no visible organelle-like structure. Instead, Ca. P. syntrophicum is morphologically complex and has unique protrusions that are long and often branching. On the basis of the available data obtained from cultivation and genomics, and reasoned interpretations of the existing literature, we propose a hypothetical model for eukaryogenesis, termed the entangle-engulf-endogenize (also known as E3) model."
https://openalex.org/W3000438116,"Immune surveillance against pathogens and tumours in the central nervous system is thought to be limited owing to the lack of lymphatic drainage. However, the characterization of the meningeal lymphatic network has shed light on previously unappreciated ways that an immune response can be elicited to antigens that are expressed in the brain1-3. Despite progress in our understanding of the development and structure of the meningeal lymphatic system, the contribution of this network in evoking a protective antigen-specific immune response in the brain remains unclear. Here, using a mouse model of glioblastoma, we show that the meningeal lymphatic vasculature can be manipulated to mount better immune responses against brain tumours. The immunity that is mediated by CD8 T cells to the glioblastoma antigen is very limited when the tumour is confined to the central nervous system, resulting in uncontrolled tumour growth. However, ectopic expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) promotes enhanced priming of CD8 T cells in the draining deep cervical lymph nodes, migration of CD8 T cells into the tumour, rapid clearance of the glioblastoma and a long-lasting antitumour memory response. Furthermore, transfection of an mRNA construct that expresses VEGF-C works synergistically with checkpoint blockade therapy to eradicate existing glioblastoma. These results reveal the capacity of VEGF-C to promote immune surveillance of tumours, and suggest a new therapeutic approach to treat brain tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2999778183,"Since its introduction, the reward prediction error theory of dopamine has explained a wealth of empirical phenomena, providing a unifying framework for understanding the representation of reward and value in the brain1–3. According to the now canonical theory, reward predictions are represented as a single scalar quantity, which supports learning about the expectation, or mean, of stochastic outcomes. Here we propose an account of dopamine-based reinforcement learning inspired by recent artificial intelligence research on distributional reinforcement learning4–6. We hypothesized that the brain represents possible future rewards not as a single mean, but instead as a probability distribution, effectively representing multiple future outcomes simultaneously and in parallel. This idea implies a set of empirical predictions, which we tested using single-unit recordings from mouse ventral tegmental area. Our findings provide strong evidence for a neural realization of distributional reinforcement learning. Analyses of single-cell recordings from mouse ventral tegmental area are consistent with a model of reinforcement learning in which the brain represents possible future rewards not as a single mean of stochastic outcomes, as in the canonical model, but instead as a probability distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2999052663,"The CRISPR system in bacteria and archaea provides adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements. Type III CRISPR systems detect viral RNA, resulting in the activation of two regions of the Cas10 protein: an HD nuclease domain (which degrades viral DNA)1,2 and a cyclase domain (which synthesizes cyclic oligoadenylates from ATP)3-5. Cyclic oligoadenylates in turn activate defence enzymes with a CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold domain6, sculpting a powerful antiviral response7-10 that can drive viruses to extinction7,8. Cyclic nucleotides are increasingly implicated in host-pathogen interactions11-13. Here we identify a new family of viral anti-CRISPR (Acr) enzymes that rapidly degrade cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA4). The viral ring nuclease AcrIII-1 is widely distributed in archaeal and bacterial viruses and in proviruses. The enzyme uses a previously unknown fold to bind cA4 specifically, and a conserved active site to rapidly cleave this signalling molecule, allowing viruses to neutralize the type III CRISPR defence system. The AcrIII-1 family has a broad host range, as it targets cA4 signalling molecules rather than specific CRISPR effector proteins. Our findings highlight the crucial role of cyclic nucleotide signalling in the conflict between viruses and their hosts."

https://openalex.org/W2999865404,"The migration of cancer cells is highly regulated by the biomechanical properties of their local microenvironment. Using 3D scaffolds of simple composition, several aspects of cancer cell mechanosensing (signal transduction, EMC remodeling, traction forces) have been separately analyzed in the context of cell migration. However, a combined study of these factors in 3D scaffolds that more closely resemble the complex microenvironment of the cancer ECM is still missing. Here, we present a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of the role of cell-ECM interactions in cancer cell migration within a highly physiological environment consisting of mixed Matrigel-collagen hydrogel scaffolds of increasing complexity that mimic the tumor microenvironment at the leading edge of cancer invasion. We quantitatively show that the presence of Matrigel increases hydrogel stiffness, which promotes β1 integrin expression and metalloproteinase activity in H1299 lung cancer cells. Then, we show that ECM remodeling activity causes matrix alignment and compaction that favors higher tractions exerted by the cells. However, these traction forces do not linearly translate into increased motility due to a biphasic role of cell adhesions in cell migration: at low concentration Matrigel promotes migration-effective tractions exerted through a high number of small sized focal adhesions. However, at high Matrigel concentration, traction forces are exerted through fewer, but larger focal adhesions that favor attachment yielding lower cell motility."

https://openalex.org/W3103085519,"Self organisation provides an elegant explanation for how complex structures emerge and persist throughout nature. Surprisingly often, these structures exhibit remarkably similar scale-invariant properties. While this is sometimes captured by simple models that feature a critical point as an attractor for the dynamics, the connection to real-world systems is exceptionally hard to test quantitatively. Here we observe three key signatures of self-organised criticality in the dynamics of a driven-dissipative gas of ultracold atoms: (i) self-organisation to a stationary state that is largely independent of the initial conditions, (ii) scale-invariance of the final density characterised by a unique scaling function, and (iii) large fluctuations of the number of excited atoms (avalanches) obeying a characteristic power-law distribution. This establishes a well-controlled platform for investigating self-organisation phenomena and non-equilibrium criticality with unprecedented experimental access to the underlying microscopic details of the system."
https://openalex.org/W3000503217,"The ability of solar ultraviolet (UV) to induce skin cancer and photoaging is well recognized. The effect of the infrared (IR) and visible light (Vis) components of solar radiation on skin and their interaction with UV is less well known. This study compared the effects of physiologically relevant doses of complete (UV + Vis + IR) solar-simulated light and its individual components on matched primary dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes from human donors on three biomarkers of cellular damage (reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and nuclear DNA (nDNA) damage). There was a greater induction of ROS, mtDNA, and nDNA damage with the inclusion of the visible and IR components of solar-simulated light in primary fibroblast cells compared to primary keratinocytes (P < .001). Experiments using exposure to specific components of solar light alone or in combination showed that the UV, Vis, and IR components of solar light synergistically increased ROS generation in primary fibroblasts but not primary keratinocytes (P < .001). Skin cell lines were used to confirm these findings. These observations have important implications for different skin cell type responses to the individual and interacting components of solar light and therefore photodamage mechanisms and photoprotection interventions."

https://openalex.org/W3002474570,"The present study aimed to investigate the extent to which the severity of misophonia symptoms is linked with cognitive control under misophonia symptom-provocation circumstances in the general population sample. Participants (N = 79) completed a measure of cognitive control–a Stroop color naming task, which consists of congruent and incongruent stimuli, and requires inhibition of a prepotent response (reading a word) in the service of a less predominant response (naming a color), while listening to misophonia symptom-provocation or universally unpleasant sounds. Participants’ misophonia sound sensitivity, and emotional behaviors towards trigger sounds were assessed using the Misophonia Questionnaire. Stronger emotional behavioral reactions to misophonia trigger sounds were significantly associated with the larger Stroop effect when participants were exposed to the misophonia trigger sounds, but not when they were exposed to the universally unpleasant sounds. This effect held when controlling for the personality trait of Neuroticism and for baseline levels of anxiety. Both elevated misophonia sound sensitivity and emotional behaviors towards trigger sounds significantly correlated with higher self-reported anxiety when performing the Stroop task. However, only elevated emotional behaviors towards trigger sounds were linked with higher anxiety levels at baseline, suggesting that people who experience stronger emotions and behavioral reactions to misophonia trigger sounds may have higher anxiety at a trait level. Limitations and future directions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2999072852,"Background Amyloid β peptide (Aβ) is involved in osteoporosis, but the effects of Aβ on osteoblast and bone formation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of Aβ on bone formation. Methods An animal model of osteoporosis was established by ovariectomy in C57BL/6 mice. The mice received intraperitoneal injection of Aβ. The effect of Aβ on the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal stem cells (hBMSCs) and differentiation of both pre-osteoblasts and pre-osteoclasts in a co-culture system were investigated. Results In the animal study, intraperitoneal injection of Aβ for 8 weeks promoted early and late osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Aβ treatment significantly elevated osterix+ (osteoblastic) cells but decreased TRAP+ cells (osteoclasts) in the distal femur bone. In vitro study showed that Aβ treatment significantly enhanced matrix mineralization and osteogenic markers (Runx2 and osteocalcin). Aβ treatment activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in hBMSCs. The effect of Aβ was blocked by DKK1 (a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor) treatment. In the co-culture system, Aβ treatment significantly increased the ALP activities of MC3T3-E1 cells (pre-osteoblasts) but reduced the TRAP+ RAW264.7 cells (pre-osteoclasts). Aβ treatment upregulated TCF1 and OPG proteins in MC3T3-E1 cells. Aβ treatment upregulated IκB-α but downregulated NFATc1protein in RAW264.7 cells. These effects were blocked by XAV-939 (a Wnt signaling antagonist), and then rescued by additional Wnt3a (a Wnt agonist). Conclusion Aβ treatment simultaneously promoted osteogenic differentiation via Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and inhibited osteoclasts differentiation via the OPG/RANKL/RANK system, suggesting Aβ is a positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W3013646438,"The identification of potential interactions between drugs and target proteins is crucial in pharmaceutical sciences. The experimental validation of interactions in genomic drug discovery is laborious and expensive; hence, there is a need for efficient and accurate in-silico techniques which can predict potential drug-target interactions to narrow down the search space for experimental verification. In this work, we propose a new framework, namely, Multi-Graph Regularized Nuclear Norm Minimization, which predicts the interactions between drugs and target proteins from three inputs: known drug-target interaction network, similarities over drugs and those over targets. The proposed method focuses on finding a low-rank interaction matrix that is structured by the proximities of drugs and targets encoded by graphs. Previous works on Drug Target Interaction (DTI) prediction have shown that incorporating drug and target similarities helps in learning the data manifold better by preserving the local geometries of the original data. But, there is no clear consensus on which kind and what combination of similarities would best assist the prediction task. Hence, we propose to use various multiple drug-drug similarities and target-target similarities as multiple graph Laplacian (over drugs/targets) regularization terms to capture the proximities exhaustively. Extensive cross-validation experiments on four benchmark datasets using standard evaluation metrics (AUPR and AUC) show that the proposed algorithm improves the predictive performance and outperforms recent state-of-the-art computational methods by a large margin. Software is publicly available at https://github.com/aanchalMongia/MGRNNMforDTI."
https://openalex.org/W2999322571,"Although evidence supports brief, frequent CPR training, optimal training intervals have not been established. The purpose of this study was to compare nursing students' CPR skills (compressions and ventilations) with 4 different spaced training intervals: daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly, each for 4 times in a row.Participants were nursing students (n = 475) in the first year of their prelicensure program in 10 schools of nursing across the United States. They were randomly assigned into the 4 training intervals in each of the schools. Students were trained in CPR on a Laerdal Resusci Anne adult manikin on the Resuscitation Quality Improvement (RQI) mobile simulation station. The outcome measures were quality of compressions and ventilations as measured by the RQI program.Although students were all certified in Basic Life Support prior to the study, they were not able to adequately perform compressions and ventilations at pretest. Overall compression scores improved from sessions 1 to 4 in all training intervals (all p < .001), but shorter intervals (daily training) resulted in larger increases in compression scores by session 4. There were similar findings for ventilation skills, but at session 4, both daily and weekly intervals led to better skill performance.For students and other novices learning to perform CPR, the opportunity to train on consecutive days or weeks may be beneficial: if learners are aware of specific errors in performance, it may be easier for them to correct performance and refine skills when there is less time in between practice sessions."
https://openalex.org/W3000083725,"Unlike other species, prion disease has never been described in dogs even though they were similarly exposed to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent. This resistance prompted a thorough analysis of the canine PRNP gene and the presence of a negatively charged amino acid residue in position 163 was readily identified as potentially fundamental as it differed from all known susceptible species. In the present study, the first transgenic mouse model expressing dog prion protein (PrP) was generated and challenged intracerebrally with a panel of prion isolates, none of which could infect them. The brains of these mice were subjected to in vitro prion amplification and failed to find even minimal amounts of misfolded prions providing definitive experimental evidence that dogs are resistant to prion disease. Subsequently, a second transgenic model was generated in which aspartic acid in position 163 was substituted for asparagine (the most common in prion susceptible species) resulting in susceptibility to BSE-derived isolates. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that the amino acid residue at position 163 of canine cellular prion protein (PrPC ) is a major determinant of the exceptional resistance of the canidae family to prion infection and establish this as a promising therapeutic target for prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3000274020,"Despite the increasing importance of non-targeted metabolomics to answer various life science questions, extracting biochemically relevant information from metabolomics spectral data is still an incompletely solved problem. Most computational tools to identify tandem mass spectra focus on a limited set of molecules of interest. However, such tools are typically constrained by the availability of reference spectra or molecular databases, limiting their applicability of generating structural hypotheses for unknown metabolites. In contrast, recent advances in the field illustrate the possibility to expose the underlying biochemistry without relying on metabolite identification, in particular via substructure prediction. We describe an automated method for substructure recommendation motivated by association rule mining. Our framework captures potential relationships between spectral features and substructures learned from public spectral libraries. These associations are used to recommend substructures for any unknown mass spectrum. Our method does not require any predefined metabolite candidates, and therefore it can be used for the hypothesis generation or partial identification of unknown unknowns. The method is called MESSAR (MEtabolite SubStructure Auto-Recommender) and is implemented in a free online web service available at messar.biodatamining.be."
https://openalex.org/W2998743175,"Mangrove-derived actinobacteria strains are well-known for producing novel secondary metabolites. The polycyclic tetramate macrolactam (PTM), ikarugamycin (IKA) isolated from Streptomyces xiamenensis 318, exhibits antiproliferative activities against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in vitro. However, the protein target for bioactive IKA is unclear. In this study, whole transcriptome-based profiling revealed that the glycolysis pathway is significantly affected by IKA. Metabolomic studies demonstrated that IKA treatment induces a significant drop in glucose-6-phosphate and a slight increase in intracellular glucose level. Analysis of glucose consumption, lactate production, and the extracellular acidification rate confirmed the inhibitory role of IKA on the glycolytic flux in PDAC cells. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments and docking studies identified the key enzyme of glycolysis, hexokinase 2 (HK2), as a molecular target of IKA. Moreover, IKA reduced tumor size without overt cytotoxicity in mice with PDAC xenografts and increased chemotherapy response to gemcitabine in PDAC cells in vitro. Taken together, IKA can block glycolysis in pancreatic cancer by targeting HK2, which may be a potential drug candidate for PDAC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2999785458,"To study the pathological effects of continuous hyperprolactinemia on food intake mechanisms we used female mice that lack dopamine D2 receptors in lactotropes (lacDrd2KO). These mice had lifelong hyperprolactinemia, increased food intake, and gradual development of obesity from 5 to 10 months of age. Ongoing endogenous prolactin signaling in lacDrd2KO mice was evidenced by increased basal phosphorylation of STAT5b in hypothalamic areas related to food intake, such as the arcuate (ARN), dorsomedial (DMN), and ventromedial nuclei. In the ARN of young lacDrd2KO mice there were higher Prlr mRNA levels and in obese 10-month-old lacDrd2KO mice increased expression of the orexigenic genes Neuropeptide Y (Npy) and Agouti-related peptide, compared to controls. Furthermore, Npy expression was increased in the DMN, probably contributing to increased food intake and decreased expression of Uncoupling protein-1 in brown adipose tissue, both events favoring weight gain. Leptin resistance in obese lacD2RKO mice was evidenced by its failure to lower food intake and a dampened response of STAT3 phosphorylation, specifically in the mediobasal hypothalamus. Our results suggest that pathological chronically high prolactin levels, as found in psychiatric treatments or patients with prolactinomas, may impact on specific hypothalamic nuclei altering gene expression, leptin response, and food intake."
https://openalex.org/W2999650221,"Geobacter sulfurreducens was originally considered a strict anaerobe. However, this bacterium was later shown to not only tolerate exposure to oxygen but also to use it as terminal electron acceptor. Research performed has so far only revealed the general ability of G. sulfurreducens to reduce oxygen, but the oxygen uptake rate has not been quantified yet, nor has evidence been provided as to how the bacterium achieves oxygen reduction. Therefore, microaerobic growth of G. sulfurreducens was investigated here with better defined operating conditions as previously performed and a transcriptome analysis was performed to elucidate possible metabolic mechanisms important for oxygen reduction in G. sulfurreducens. The investigations revealed that cell growth with oxygen is possible to the same extent as with fumarate if the maximum specific oxygen uptake rate (sOUR) of 95 mgO2 gCDW-1 h-1 is not surpassed. Hereby, the entire amount of introduced oxygen is reduced. When oxygen concentrations are too high, cell growth is completely inhibited and there is no partial oxygen consumption. Transcriptome analysis suggests a menaquinol oxidase to be the enzyme responsible for oxygen reduction. Transcriptome analysis has further revealed three different survival strategies, depending on the oxygen concentration present. When prompted with small amounts of oxygen, G. sulfurreducens will try to escape the microaerobic area; if oxygen concentrations are higher, cells will focus on rapid and complete oxygen reduction coupled to cell growth; and ultimately cells will form protective layers if a complete reduction becomes impossible. The results presented here have important implications for understanding how G. sulfurreducens survives exposure to oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W3000579916,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is significantly associated with allergen sensitization in early childhood, and this may influence the gut microbiome and immune system of the children. In addition to mother-to-child transmission of microbes, milk glycans play a pivotal role in shaping the gut microbiome of infants. A previous study has demonstrated alterations in the major milk N-glycans of mothers with GDM. However, the impact of these changes on the gut microbiome and immune response of the neonates has yet to be studied. Here, we aimed to compare the glycosylation levels of various milk glycans between normal and GDM mice, and to characterize the intestinal microbiome and immune responses of the offspring after weaning. We found that GDM mouse milk contained significantly higher concentrations of fucosylated and sialylated N-glycans than control mice, but there was no difference in the concentration of milk oligosaccharides between the groups. The differences in milk N-glycans had direct effects on the intestinal microbiome of the offspring, which in turn affected their immune response upon challenge with ovalbumin (OVA), with disruptions in the Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg cell balances. This study lays the foundation for further research and development of specific nutritional care for the offspring of GDM mothers."
https://openalex.org/W2999077166,"In this article, we quantitatively study, through stochastic models, the effects of several intracellular phenomena, such as cell volume growth, cell division, gene replication as well as fluctuations of available RNA polymerases and ribosomes. These phenomena are indeed rarely considered in classic models of protein production and no relative quantitative comparison among them has been performed. The parameters for a large and representative class of proteins are determined using experimental measures. The main important and surprising conclusion of our study is to show that despite the significant fluctuations of free RNA polymerases and free ribosomes, they bring little variability to protein production contrary to what has been previously proposed in the literature. After verifying the robustness of this quite counter-intuitive result, we discuss its possible origin from a theoretical view, and interpret it as the result of a mean-field effect."
https://openalex.org/W3000327775,"Wear debris-induced osteolysis and ensuing aseptic loosening is the main cause of implant failure and revision surgery. Wear debris-induced inflammatory response plays key roles in peri-implant osteolysis. Recently, substantial of evidence suggests that hydrogen sulfide (H2 S), the third gasotransmitter, is a critical player regulating inflammation. However, the role and therapeutic potential of H2 S in wear debris-induced inflammation and osteolysis remains to be defined. In the present study, we investigated the effect of H2 S on wear debris-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and osteolysis in vitro and in vivo. With a slow-releasing H2 S donor GYY4137, our study demonstrated that H2 S attenuated wear debris-induced osteolysis and osteoclastogenesis in murine calvaria resorption models. The expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) that stimulated by wear particles were significantly reduced by GYY4137. Further, the level of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which possesses anti-inflammation property, was examined in vivo and in macrophages. And we found that wear debris decreased the expression of SIRT1. Cotreated macrophages with GYY4137 in part reversed the decline of SIRT1. More importantly, with the SIRT1 recombinant lentivirus and small interfering RNAs (siRNA) against SIRT1, our data indicated that SIRT1 mediated the inhibitory effects of GYY4137 on wear debris-induced inflammation. Collectively, these results suggested that exogenous H2 S production (via H2 S donors) may represent a potential approach for the treatment of wear particle-induced osteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2999604219,"Bhutan represents typical mountain agriculture farming systems with unique challenges. The agriculture production systems under environmental constraints are typical of small-scale agricultural subsistence systems related to family farming in the Himalayan Mountains with very low level of mechanization, numerous abiotic stresses influenced by climate and other socio-economic constraints. Quinoa was first introduced in 2015 through FAO’s support to Bhutan as a new crop to enhance the food and nutritional security of the Bhutanese people. The main objective was to adapt this versatile crop to the local mountain agriculture conditions as a climate resilient crop for diversifying the farmer’s traditional potato and maize based cropping systems. Ten quinoa varieties were evaluated at two different sites representing contrasted mountain agroecologies in Bhutan and were tested during the two agricultural campaigns 2016 and 2017. Yusipang (2600 masl) represents the cool temperate agroecological zone, and Lingmethang (640 masl) the dry subtropical agroecological zone. The sowing time differed depending on the growing season and elevation of the sites. Results indicate that quinoa can be successfully grown in Bhutan for the two different agroecological zones. The grain yields varied from 0.61 to 2.68 t.ha-1 in the high altitude areas where quinoa was seeded in spring and harvested in autumn season. The grain yield in the lower elevation ranged from 1.59 to 2.98 t.ha-1 where the crop was sown in autumn and harvested in winter season. Depending on genotypes’ characteristics and agroecological zones, crop maturity significantly varied from 92 to 197 days with all genotypes maturing much earlier in the lower elevations where mean minimum and maximum temperatures during the growing season were higher. Quinoa is rapidly promoted across different agroecological contexts in the country as a new climate resilient and nutrient dense pseudo cereal to diversify the traditional existing cropping system with some necessary adjustments in sowing time, suitable varieties and crop management practices. To fast track the rapid promotion of this new crop in Bhutan, four varieties have been released in 2018. In just over three years, the cultivation of quinoa as a new cereal has been demonstrated and partially adapted to the maize and potato based traditional cropping systems under the Himalayan mountain agriculture. Quinoa is also being adapted to the rice based cropping system and rapidly promoted as an alternative food security crop in the current 12th Five Year national development plan of Bhutan. To rapidly promote quinoa cultivation, the Royal Government of Bhutan is supporting the supply of free quinoa seeds, cultivation technologies and milling machines to the rural communities. To promote the consumption and utilization of quinoa at national level, consumer awareness are created by preparing and serving local Bhutanese dishes from quinoa during local food fairs and farmer’s field days. In addition, the Royal Government of Bhutan has included quinoa in the school feeding programme recognizing the high nutrient value of the crop for enhancing and securing the nutritional needs of the young children."
https://openalex.org/W2999418229,"Light is a crucial signal that regulates many aspects of plant physiology and growth including the development of stomata, the pores in the epidermal surface of the leaf. Light signals positively regulate stomatal development leading to changes in stomatal density and stomatal index (SI; the proportion of cells in the epidermis that are stomata). Both phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors are required to regulate stomatal development in response to light. The transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) is a key regulator of light signalling, acting downstream of photoreceptors. We hypothesised that HY5 could regulate stomatal development in response to light signals due to the putative presence of HY5 binding sites in the promoter of the STOMAGEN (STOM) gene, which encodes a peptide regulator of stomatal development. Our analysis shows that HY5 does have the potential to regulate the STOM promoter in vitro and that HY5 is expressed in both the epidermis and mesophyll. However, analysis of hy5 and hy5 hyh double mutants (HYH; HY5-HOMOLOG), found that they had normal stomatal development under different light conditions and the expression of stomatal developmental genes was not perturbed following light shift experiments. Analysis of stable lines overexpressing HY5 also showed no change in stomatal development or the expression of stomatal developmental genes. We therefore conclude that whilst HY5 has the potential to regulate the expression of STOM, it does not have a major role in regulating stomatal development in response to light signals."
https://openalex.org/W2998868044,"The HIF hydroxylase enzymes (PHD1-3 and FIH) are cellular oxygen-sensors which confer hypoxic-sensitivity upon the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Microenvironmental hypoxia has a strong influence on the epithelial and immune cell function through HIF-dependent gene expression and consequently impacts upon the course of disease progression in ulcerative colitis (UC), with HIF-1α being protective while HIF-2α promotes disease. However, little is known about how inflammation regulates hypoxia-responsive pathways in UC patients. Here we demonstrate that hypoxia is a prominent microenvironmental feature of the mucosa in UC patients with active inflammatory disease. Furthermore, we found that inflammation drives transcriptional programming of the HIF pathway including downregulation of PHD1 thereby increasing the tissue responsiveness to hypoxia and skewing this response toward protective HIF-1 over detrimental HIF-2 activation. We identified CEBPα as a transcriptional regulator of PHD1 mRNA expression which is downregulated in both inflamed tissue derived from patients and in cultured intestinal epithelial cells treated with inflammatory cytokines. In summary, we propose that PHD1 downregulation skews the hypoxic response toward enhanced protective HIF-1α stabilization in the inflamed mucosa of UC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2998817759,"Background The global burden of hypertension, currently estimated at 1 billion, is a leading Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) in Sub Saharan Africa. In Tanzania, the reported prevalence of hypertension is 25%. Inherent limitations of the healthcare system to control hypertension include inadequate provider knowledge, system capacity, medication access, and patient awareness, all of which hinder effective screening and disease management. To assess the quality of hypertension screening and patient counseling, we conducted a study in an ambulatory setting in Tanzania. Methods Observations of patient screening were conducted on 69 adult patients during routine outpatient care and screening camps. In addition, 33 healthcare providers participated in a pre-post knowledge assessment after observing instructional training videos. Results Patient observations indicated that blood pressure (BP) measurement was explained to 65% of patients, and 77% of the measurements were made with mercury sphygmomanometers. For several aspects of BP measurement, nurses performed better than doctors: patient’s arm supported on a flat surface (doctors, 58% vs nurses 67%, p<0.05), and patient’s back was supported (doctors, 50% vs nurses 88%, p<0.01). Among those diagnosed with hypertension, 7% were prescribed medications, 14% were advised on reduced salt during cooking, 29% on reduced salt consumption, 21% on reduced consumption of sodium rich foods, 21% on reducing caloric intake, 21% on increasing physical activity, and 43% were informed about follow up appointments. Provider knowledge assessments showed critical gaps in consequences of hypertension, 1st line medicines, and awareness of guidelines at baseline. Following the instructional videos there were improvements in some aspects: diagnostic criteria for hypertension (pre 45% vs post 91%, p<0.001) and counseling for controlling hypertension (pre 30% vs post 58%, p<0.01). Conclusion Enhancing knowledge and performance competencies of health providers at the primary care level is a critical prerequisite for effective hypertension management in low resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W3000107548,"So far, the mechanism that links mitochondrial dysfunction to PDX1 inhibition in the pathogenesis of pancreatic β cell dysfunction under diabetic condition remains largely unclear. This study determined the role of mitochondrial protein FAM3A in regulating PDX1 expression in pancreatic β cells using gain- and loss-of function methods in vitro and in vivo. Within pancreas, FAM3A is highly expressed in β, α, δ, and pp cells of islets. Islet FAM3A expression was correlated with insulin expression under physiological and diabetic conditions. Mice with specific knockout of FAM3A in islet β cells exhibited markedly blunted insulin secretion and glucose intolerance. FAM3A-deficient islets showed significant decrease in PDX1 expression, and insulin expression and secretion. FAM3A overexpression upregulated PDX1 and insulin expressions, and augmented insulin secretion in cultured islets and β cells. Mechanistically, FAM3A enhanced ATP production to elevate cellular Ca2+ level and promote insulin secretion. Furthermore, FAM3A-induced ATP release activated CaM to function as a co-activator of FOXA2, stimulating PDX1 gene transcription. In conclusion, FAM3A plays crucial roles in controlling PDX1 and insulin expressions in pancreatic β cells. Inhibition of FAM3A will trigger mitochondrial dysfunction to repress PDX1 and insulin expressions."
https://openalex.org/W2999688295,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling influences numerous cell biological mechanisms such as differentiation, proliferation, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. Intriguingly, our current knowledge is based solely on the role of S1P with an 18-carbon long-chain base length, S1P d18:1. Depending on the composition of the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the sphingolipid de novo metabolism, the serine palmitoyltransferase, other chain lengths have been described in vivo. While cells are also able to produce S1P d20:1, its abundance and function remains elusive so far. Our experiments are highlighting the role of S1P d20:1 in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) and human glioblastoma. We show here that S1P d20:1 and its precursors are detectable in both healthy mouse CNS-tissue and human glioblastoma. On the functional level, we focused our work on one particular, well-characterized pathway, the induction of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression via the S1P receptor 2 (S1P2). Intriguingly, S1P d20:1 only fairly induces COX-2 expression and can block the S1P d18:1-induced COX-2 expression mediated via S1P2 activation in the human glioblastoma cell line LN229. This data indicates that S1P d20:1 might act as an endogenous modulator of S1P signaling via a partial agonism at the S1P2 receptor. While our findings might stimulate further research on the relevance of long-chain base lengths in sphingolipid signaling, the metabolism of S1P d20:1 has to be considered as an integral part of S1P signaling pathways in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3000619643,"Malic enzyme 1 (Me1), a member of the malic enzymes involving in glycolytic pathway and citric acid cycle, is essential for the energy metabolism and maintenance of intracellular redox balance state, but its physiological role and regulatory mechanism in the uterine decidualization are still unknown. Current study showed that Me1 was strongly expressed in decidual cells, and could promote the proliferation and differentiation of stromal cells followed by an accelerated cell cycle transition, indicating an importance of Me1 in the uterine decidualization. Silencing of Me1 attenuated NADPH generation and reduced GR activity, while addition of NADPH improved the defect of GR activity elicited by Me1 depletion. Further analysis found that Me1 modulated intracellular GSH content via GR. Meanwhile, Me1 played a role in maintaining mitochondrial function as indicated by these observations that blockadge of Me1 led to the accumulation of mitochondrial O 2 - level and decreased ATP production and mtDNA copy numbers accompanied with defective mitochondrial membrane potential. In uterine stromal cells, progesterone induced Me1 expression through PR-cAMP-PKA pathway. Knockdown of HB-EGF might impede the regulation of progesterone and cAMP on Me1. Collectively, Me1 is essential for uterine decidualization in response to progesterone/cAMP/PKA/HB-EGF pathway and plays an important role in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W2999760194,"Memory is thought to be encoded by sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles in memory-related regions. However, it is unclear how memory-eligible neurons react during learning to encode trace fear memory and how they retrieve a memory. We implemented a fiber-optic confocal fluorescence endomicroscope to directly visualize calcium dynamics of hippocampal CA1 neurons in freely behaving mice subjected to trace fear conditioning. Here we report that the overall activity levels of CA1 neurons showed a right-skewed lognormal distribution, with a small portion of highly active neurons (termed Primed Neurons) filling the long-tail. Repetitive training induced Primed Neurons to shift from random activity to well-tuned synchronization. The emergence of activity synchronization coincided with the appearance of mouse freezing behaviors. In recall, a partial synchronization among the same subset of Primed Neurons was induced from random dynamics, which also coincided with mouse freezing behaviors. Additionally, training-induced synchronization facilitated robust calcium entry into Primed Neurons. In contrast, most CA1 neurons did not respond to tone and foot shock throughout the training and recall cycles. In conclusion, Primed Neurons are preferably recruited to encode trace fear memory and induction of activity synchronization among Primed Neurons out of random dynamics is critical for trace memory formation and retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W3000338352,"Compressed gas-driven shock tubes are widely used for laboratory simulation of primary blasts by accurately replicating pressure profiles measured in live-fire explosions. These investigations require sound characterization of the primary blast wave, including the temporal and spatial evolution of the static and dynamic components of the blast wave. The goal of this work is to characterize the propagation of shock waves in and around the exit of a shock tube via analysis of the primary shock flow, including shock wave propagation and decay of the shock front, and secondary flow phenomena. To this end, a nine-inch shock tube and a cylindrical sensing apparatus were used to determine incident and total pressures outside of the shock tube, highlighting the presence of additional flow phenomena. Blast overpressure, impulse, shock wave arrival times, positive phase duration, and shock wave planarity were examined using a finite element model of the system. The shock wave remained planar inside of the shock tube and lost its planarity upon exiting. The peak overpressure and pressure impulse decayed rapidly upon exit from the shock tube, reducing by 92-95%. The primary flow phenomenon, or the planar shock front, is observed within the shock tube, while two distinct flow phenomena are a result of the shock wave exiting the confines of the shock tube. A vortex ring is formed as the shock wave exited the shock tube into the still, ambient air, which induces a large increase in the total pressure impulse. Additionally, a rarefaction wave was formed following shock front expansion, which traveled upstream into the shock tube, reducing the total and incident pressure impulses for approximately half of the simulated region."
https://openalex.org/W3000144592,"The crystal structure of a C-terminal deletion of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA1) shows a large helical bundle structure in the amino half of the protein, from residues 8 to 115. Using site directed mutagenesis, guanidine or thermal denaturation, cell free liposome clearance, and cellular ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux assays, we demonstrate that apoA1 lipidation can occur when the thermodynamic barrier to this bundle unfolding is lowered. The absence of the C-terminus renders the bundle harder to unfold resulting in loss of apoA1 lipidation that can be reversed by point mutations, such as Trp8Ala, and by truncations as short as 8 residues in the amino terminus, both of which facilitate helical bundle unfolding. Locking the bundle via a disulfide bond leads to loss of apoA1 lipidation. We propose a model in which the C-terminus acts on the N-terminus to destabilize this helical bundle. Upon lipid binding to the C-terminus, Trp8 is displaced from its interaction with Phe57, Arg61, Leu64, Val67, Phe71, and Trp72 to destabilize the bundle. However, when the C-terminus is deleted, Trp8 cannot be displaced, the bundle cannot unfold, and apoA1 cannot be lipidated."
https://openalex.org/W2999764733,"Quantification of the angular orientation distribution of fibrous tissue structures in scientific images benefits from the Fourier image analysis to obtain quantitative information. Measurement uncertainties represent a major challenge and need to be considered by propagating them in order to determine an adaptive anisotropic Fourier filter. Our adaptive filter method (AF) is based on the maximum relative uncertainty δcut of the power spectrum as well as a weighted radial sum with weighting factor α. We use a Monte-Carlo simulation to obtain realistic greyscale images that include defined variations in fiber thickness, length, and angular dispersion as well as variations in noise. From this simulation the best agreement between predefined and derived angular orientation distribution is found for evaluation parameters δcut = 2.1% and α = 1.5. The resulting cumulative orientation distribution was modeled by a sigmoid function to obtain the mean angle and the fiber dispersion. A comparison to a state-of-the-art band-pass method revealed that the AF method is more suitable for the application on greyscale fiber images, since the error of the fiber dispersion significantly decreased from (33.9 ± 26.5)% to (13.2 ± 12.7)%. Both methods were found to accurately quantify the mean fiber orientation with an error of (1.9 ± 1.5)° and (2.3 ± 2.1)° in case of the AF and the band-pass method, respectively. We demonstrate that the AF method is able to accurately quantify the fiber orientation distribution in in vivo second-harmonic generation images of dermal collagen with a mean fiber orientation error of (6.0 ± 4.0)° and a dispersion error of (9.3 ± 12.1)%."
https://openalex.org/W3000058210,"We have developed and applied a relatively simple disaggregation scheme that uses spatial patterns of Land Surface Temperature (LST) from MODIS warm-season composites to improve the spatial characterization of daily maximum and minimum air temperatures. This down-scaling model produces qualitatively reasonable 1 km daily maximum and minimum air temperature estimates that reflect urban and coastal features. In a 5-city validation, the model was shown to provide improved daily maximum air temperature estimates in the three coastal cities, compared to 12 km NLDAS-2 (North American Land Data Assimilation System). Down-scaled maximum temperature estimates for the other two (non-coastal) cities were marginally worse than the original NLDAS-2 temperatures. For daily minimum temperatures, the scheme produces spatial fields that qualitatively capture geographic features, but quantitative validation shows the down-scaling model performance to be very similar to the original NLDAS-2 minimum temperatures. Thus, we limit the discussion in this paper to daily maximum temperatures. Overall, errors in the down-scaled maximum air temperatures are comparable to errors in down-scaled LST obtained in previous studies. The advantage of this approach is that it produces estimates of daily maximum air temperatures, which is more relevant than LST in applications such as public health. The resulting 1 km daily maximum air temperatures have great potential utility for applications such as public health, energy demand, and surface energy balance analyses. The method may not perform as well in conditions of strong temperature advection. Application of the model also may be problematic in areas having extreme changes in elevation."

https://openalex.org/W2999749314,"Background Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (IFAS) is recommended by World Health Organization as part of antenatal care to prevent anaemia in pregnancy. In 2010, Kenya adopted this recommendation and the current policy is to provide one combined IFAS tablet for daily use throughout pregnancy, free of charge, in all public health facilities. However, adherence remains low over the years though anaemia in pregnancy remains high. Integration of IFAS into community-based interventions has been recommended because of its excellent outcome. Using Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) to distribute IFAS has not been implemented in Kenya before. Methods Following an intervention study implementing a community-based approach for IFAS in five public health facilities in Lari Sub-County, 19 interviews were conducted among CHVs, nurses and pregnant women participating to describe their experiences. Thematic analysis of data was done using NVivo and findings described, with use of quotes. Findings The nurses, CHVs and pregnant women were all positive and supportive of community-based approach for IFAS. They reported increased access and utilization of both IFAS and antenatal services leading to perceived reduction in anaemia and better pregnancy outcomes. Counselling provided by CHVs improved IFAS knowledge among pregnant women and consequent adherence. The increased IFAS utilization led to main challenge experienced being IFAS stock-outs. All participants recommended complementing antenatal IFAS distribution approach with community-based approach for IFAS. Conclusion Using CHVs to implement a community-based approach for IFAS was successful and increased supplement awareness and utilization. However, the role of CHVs in IFAS programme implementation is not clearly defined in current policy and their potential in IFAS education and distribution is not fully utilized. All participants endorsed integration of community-based approach for IFAS into the antenatal approach to enhance IFAS coverage and adherence among pregnant women for better pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3000389859,"A well-known phenomenon is that humans perceive risks to threaten future generations as more dangerous in many cases. However, this tendency could be changed depending on certain conditions and could potentially be explained by the evolution of altruism. Our multi-agent simulation model, which was constructed to identify attributes contributing to subjective assessment of a risk source based on kin selection theory, showed that support from relatives can affect the agents' subjective risk assessment. We utilize this insight, which has never been explored in the context of nudge, to show that real-world messages reminding respondents that they are supported by their relatives can moderate the perception of a risk source as extremely dangerous. A randomized control trial based on an internet questionnaire survey was conducted to identify the intervention effect of such messages, using air pollution caused by industrialization as the risk source for the case study. Our analysis suggests that messages moderate extreme attitudes. Presentation of additional visual information can boost the sense of familial support and increase the effect of a message compared with a message comprising only textual information. The attributes and personality traits of the respondents who are responsive to the intervention message are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2998849206,"In vivo DNA engineering such as recombineering (recombination-mediated genetic engineering) and DNA gap repair typically involve growing Escherichia coli (E coli) containing plasmids, followed by plasmid DNA extraction and purification prior to downstream PCR-mediated DNA modifications and DNA sequencing. We previously demonstrated that crude cell lysates could be used for some limited downstream DNA applications. Here, we show how live E coli cell PCR and one-step LiCl-isopropanol purification can streamline DNA engineering. In DNA gap repair, live-cell PCR allowed the convenient elimination of clones containing background plasmids prior to DNA sequencing. Live-cell PCR also enabled the generation of specific DNA sequences for DNA engineering up to 11 kilo base pairs in length and with up to 80 base pair terminal non-homology. Using gel electrophoresis and DNA melting curve analysis, we showed that LiCl-isopropanol DNA precipitation removed primers and small, nonspecific PCR products from live-cell PCR products in only ~10-minutes. DNA sequencing of purified products yielded Phred quality scores values of ~55%. These data indicate that live-cell PCR and LiCl-isopropanol DNA precipitation are ideal to prepare DNA for sequencing and other downstream DNA applications, and might therefore accelerate high-throughput DNA engineering pipelines."

In this study we quantified differences in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, CD4+% recovery and MTMR after starting HIV-1 treatment with dolutegravir (DTG) vs. raltegravir (RAL) plus a NRTI backbone. Methods Exploratory post-hoc analysis of the SPRING-2 study, a randomized double-blind clinical trial comparing DTG and RAL as third agents in naive HIV-infected patients at 100 sites in Canada, USA, Australia, and Europe. Percentage differences and corresponding precision based on 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values were calculated for i) CD4+/CD8+ ratio normalization, ii) CD4+% normalization, and iii) the achievement of MTMR. Results A total of 822 participants were analyzed (411 in each group). No statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients who reached a CD4+/CD8+ ratio ≥0.5 & ≥1 at w48 & w96 were observed. At w96, the proportion of patients with a CD4+/CD8+ ratio ≥1 was similar (30.43% DTG vs. 29.57% RAL). No differences were observed in the mean increase in CD4+/CD8+ ratio from baseline at both w48 & w96. Similarly, no significant differences in the CD4+/CD8+>29% were observed at w96 (72.95% DTG vs 69.28% RAL). The proportion of patients attaining MTMR criteria was also similar in the DTG group and the RAL group at w48 (20.33% vs. 18.26%; difference 2.07 (95%CI (-3.67;7.81) P = 0.481 and w96 (28.70% vs. 27.13; difference 1.56 (95%CI -5.22;8.34) P = 0.652).

The roles of time-varying elements in this decrease are unknown. Analyzing MM with age-period-cohort analysis will provide evidence to policymakers to re-direct resources towards vulnerable age groups. The aim of this analysis was to determine the role of age effect, period effect and birth cohort effect on the trend of age-specific maternal mortality in Ethiopia.Age-period-cohort (APC) analysis was applied to examine the effect of age, period and birth cohort on MM in Ethiopia using data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) from years 2000, 2005, 2011 and 2016. Age-specific maternal mortality rates were calculated using standardized maternal death compared to age-specific population per 100,000 woman-years of exposure and the trend was analyzed.In most age groups, the MM rate decreased in 2015 compared with the previous years except for older women. According to the APC analysis, the age-cohort effect explains the MM rate better than age-period effect. The period effect shows the risk ratio of MM after 2005 decreased compared with before. The cohort effect illustrates women born after 1980 has lower risk ratio compared with the older one.Maternal mortality in Ethiopia declined overall in recent years. However, certain age groups still face high maternal mortality rates. A national policy on MM reduction interventions for the identified high-risk age groups is required."
https://openalex.org/W2999488619,"Objectives Out-of-sample forecasts are used to evaluate the predictive adequacy of a previously published national model of the relationship between smoking behavior and real per capita health care expenditure using state level aggregate data. In the previously published analysis, the elasticities between changes in state adult current smoking prevalence and mean cigarette consumption per adult current smoker and healthcare expenditures were 0.118 and 0.108 This new analysis provides evidence that the model forecasts out-of-sample well. Methods Out-of-sample predictive performance was used to find the best specification of trend variables and the best model to bridge a break in survey data used in the analysis. Monte-Carlo simulation was used to calculate forecast intervals for the effect of changes in smoking behavior on expected real per capita healthcare expenditures. Results The model specification produced good-out-of-sample forecasts and stable recursive regression parameter estimates spanning the break in survey methodology. In 2014, a 1% relative reduction in adult current smoking prevalence and mean cigarette consumption per adult current smoker decreased real per capita healthcare expenditure by 0.104% and 0.113% the following year, respectively (elasticity). A permanent relative reduction of 5% reduces expected real per capita healthcare expenditures $99 (95% CI $44, $154) in the next year and $31.5 billion for the entire US (in 2014 dollars), holding other factors constant. The reductions accumulate linearly for at least five years following annual permanent decreases of 5% each year. Given the limitations of time series modelling in a relatively short time series, the effect of changes in smoking behavior may occur over several years, even though the model contains only one lag for the explanatory variables. Conclusion Reductions in smoking produce substantial savings in real per capita healthcare expenditure in short to medium term. A 5% relative drop in smoking prevalence (about a 0.87% reduction in absolute prevalence) combined with a 5% drop in consumption per remaining smoker (about 16 packs/year) would be followed by a $31.5 billion reduction in healthcare expenditure (in 2014 dollars)."
https://openalex.org/W3000353326,"De facto marine protected areas (DFMPAs) are regions of the ocean where human activity is restricted for reasons other than conservation. Although DFMPAs are widespread globally, their potential role in the protection of marine habitats, species, and ecosystems has not been well studied. In 2012 and 2013, we conducted remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys of marine communities at a military DFMPA closed to all civilian access since 2010 and an adjacent fished reference site at San Clemente Island, the southernmost of California's Channel Islands. We used data extracted from ROV imagery to compare density and biomass of focal species, as well as biodiversity and community composition, between the two sites. Generalized linear modeling indicated that both density and biomass of California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher) were significantly higher inside the DFMPA. Biomass of ocean whitefish (Caulolatilus princeps) was also significantly higher inside the DFMPA. However, species richness and Shannon-Weaver diversity were not significantly higher inside the DFMPA, and overall fish community composition did not differ significantly between sites. Demonstrable differences between the DFMPA and fished site for two highly sought-after species hint at early potential benefits of protection, though the lack of differences in the broader community suggests that a longer trajectory of recovery may be required for other species. A more comprehensive understanding of the potential conservation benefits of DFMPAs is important in the context of marine spatial planning and global marine conservation objectives."
