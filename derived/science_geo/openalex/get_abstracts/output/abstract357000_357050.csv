https://openalex.org/W1983329723,"The coupling of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom is the underlying principle of many techniques to measure mechanical displacement, from macroscale gravitational wave detectors to microscale cantilevers used in scanning probe microscopy. Recent experiments have reached a regime where the back-action of photons caused by radiation pressure can influence the optomechanical dynamics, giving rise to a host of long-anticipated phenomena. Here we review these developments and discuss the opportunities for innovative technology as well as for fundamental science."
https://openalex.org/W2133148918,"Understanding the genetic structure of human populations is of fundamental interest to medical, forensic and anthropological sciences. Advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations. Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing; an individual's DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy-often to within a few hundred kilometres."

https://openalex.org/W1967025628,"The accumulation of misfolded proteins in intracellular amyloid inclusions, typical of many neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington’s and prion disease, is thought to occur after failure of the cellular protein quality control mechanisms. Here we examine the formation of misfolded protein inclusions in the eukaryotic cytosol of yeast and mammalian cell culture models. We identify two intracellular compartments for the sequestration of misfolded cytosolic proteins. Partition of quality control substrates to either compartment seems to depend on their ubiquitination status and aggregation state. Soluble ubiquitinated misfolded proteins accumulate in a juxtanuclear compartment where proteasomes are concentrated. In contrast, terminally aggregated proteins are sequestered in a perivacuolar inclusion. Notably, disease-associated Huntingtin and prion proteins are preferentially directed to the perivacuolar compartment. Enhancing ubiquitination of a prion protein suffices to promote its delivery to the juxtanuclear inclusion. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the preferential accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins in inclusions linked to human disease. Despite the sophistication of the molecular chaperone system that catalyses the folding of polypeptides into their final native state, protein misfolding can occur. The wellbeing of the cell depends on how it manages the 'rejects'. Kaganovich et al. demonstrate that yeast and mammalian cells contain a cellular quality control pathway that distinguishes between soluble and insolubly aggregated proteins, and directs them to one of two inclusions. Soluble misfolded proteins that can be degraded by the proteasome or refolded are targeted to a juxtanuclear quality control compartment, and insoluble aggregates including disease-associated huntingtin and prion proteins are sequestered in a cytosolic inclusion associated with the autophagic pathway."

VDAC also interacts with antiapoptotic proteins from the Bcl-2 family, and this interaction inhibits release of apoptogenic proteins from the mitochondrion. We present the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of recombinant human VDAC-1 reconstituted in detergent micelles. It forms a 19-stranded β barrel with the first and last strand parallel. The hydrophobic outside perimeter of the barrel is covered by detergent molecules in a beltlike fashion. In the presence of cholesterol, recombinant VDAC-1 can form voltage-gated channels in phospholipid bilayers similar to those of the native protein. NMR measurements revealed the binding sites of VDAC-1 for the Bcl-2 protein Bcl-x L , for reduced β–nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and for cholesterol. Bcl-x L interacts with the VDAC barrel laterally at strands 17 and 18."

Interest in their activation arises in part from the high global warming potentials of anthropogenic polyfluoroorganic compounds. Conversion to carbon-hydrogen bonds (hydrodefluorination) is the simplest modification of carbon-fluorine bonds, but efficient catalytic hydrodefluorination of perfluoroalkyl groups has been an unmet challenge. We report a class of carborane-supported, highly electrophilic silylium compounds that act as long-lived catalysts for hydrodefluorination of trifluoromethyl and nonafluorobutyl groups by widely accessible silanes under mild conditions. The reactions are completely selective for aliphatic carbon-fluorine bonds in preference to aromatic carbon-fluorine bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2060587928,"The Milky Way has at least twenty-three known satellite galaxies that shine with luminosities ranging from about a thousand to a billion times that of the Sun. Half of these galaxies were discovered in the past few years in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and they are among the least luminous galaxies in the known Universe. A determination of the mass of these galaxies provides a test of galaxy formation at the smallest scales and probes the nature of the dark matter that dominates the mass density of the Universe. Here we use new measurements of the velocities of the stars in these galaxies to show that they are consistent with them having a common mass of about 10(7) within their central 300 parsecs. This result demonstrates that the faintest of the Milky Way satellites are the most dark-matter-dominated galaxies known, and could be a hint of a new scale in galaxy formation or a characteristic scale for the clustering of dark matter."
https://openalex.org/W2050375707,"At distances beyond about 100 km, quantum communication fails due to photon losses in the transmission channel. To overcome this problem, Briegel, Dür, Cirac and Zoller (BDCZ) introduced the concept of quantum repeaters, combining entanglement swapping and quantum memory to efficiently extend the achievable distances. Their implementation has proved challenging due to the difficulty of integrating a quantum memory. Zhen-ShengYuan et al. realize a building block of the BDCZ quantum repeater, demonstrating entanglement swapping with storage and retrieval of light from atomic quantum memories. Quantum communication is a method that offers efficient and secure ways for the exchange of information in a network. Large-scale quantum communication1,2,3,4 (of the order of 100 km) has been achieved; however, serious problems occur beyond this distance scale, mainly due to inevitable photon loss in the transmission channel. Quantum communication eventually fails5 when the probability of a dark count in the photon detectors becomes comparable to the probability that a photon is correctly detected. To overcome this problem, Briegel, Dür, Cirac and Zoller (BDCZ) introduced the concept of quantum repeaters6, combining entanglement swapping7 and quantum memory to efficiently extend the achievable distances. Although entanglement swapping has been experimentally demonstrated8, the implementation of BDCZ quantum repeaters has proved challenging owing to the difficulty of integrating a quantum memory. Here we realize entanglement swapping with storage and retrieval of light, a building block of the BDCZ quantum repeater. We follow a scheme9,10 that incorporates the strategy of BDCZ with atomic quantum memories11. Two atomic ensembles, each originally entangled with a single emitted photon, are projected into an entangled state by performing a joint Bell state measurement on the two single photons after they have passed through a 300-m fibre-based communication channel. The entanglement is stored in the atomic ensembles and later verified by converting the atomic excitations into photons. Our method is intrinsically phase insensitive and establishes the essential element needed to realize quantum repeaters with stationary atomic qubits as quantum memories and flying photonic qubits as quantum messengers."
https://openalex.org/W2033536968,"It is thought that bacteria excrete redox-active pigments as antibiotics to inhibit competitors. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the endogenous antibiotic pyocyanin activates SoxR, a transcription factor conserved in Proteo- and Actinobacteria. In Escherichia coli, SoxR regulates the superoxide stress response. Bioinformatic analysis coupled with gene expression studies in P. aeruginosa and Streptomyces coelicolor revealed that the majority of SoxR regulons in bacteria lack the genes required for stress responses, despite the fact that many of these organisms still produce redox-active small molecules, which indicates that redox-active pigments play a role independent of oxidative stress. These compounds had profound effects on the structural organization of colony biofilms in both P. aeruginosa and S. coelicolor, which shows that ""secondary metabolites"" play important conserved roles in gene expression and development."
https://openalex.org/W2031911789,"Experimental estimates of the effects of selection on genes determining adaptive traits add to our understanding of the mechanisms of evolution. We measured selection on genotypes of the Ectodysplasin locus, which underlie differences in lateral plates in threespine stickleback fish. A derived allele (low) causing reduced plate number has been fixed repeatedly after marine stickleback colonized freshwater from the sea, where the ancestral allele (complete) predominates. We transplanted marine sticklebacks carrying both alleles to freshwater ponds and tracked genotype frequencies over a generation. The low allele increased in frequency once lateral plates developed, most likely via a growth advantage. Opposing selection at the larval stage and changing dominance for fitness throughout life suggest either that the gene affects additional traits undergoing selection or that linked loci also are affecting fitness."

We investigated how nonpigment floral chemistry influences nectar removal, floral visitation, florivory, rates of outcrossing, and fitness through both male and female functions. We blocked expression of biosynthetic genes of the dominant floral attractant [benzyl acetone ( Nachal1 )] and nectar repellent [nicotine ( Napmt1/2 )] in all combinations in the native tobacco Nicotiana attenuata and measured their effects on plants in their native habitat. Both repellent and attractant were required to maximize capsule production and seed siring in emasculated flowers and flower visitation by native pollinators, whereas nicotine reduced florivory and nectar robbing."
https://openalex.org/W2033019168,"The antiferromagnetic ground state of copper oxide Mott insulators is achieved by localizing an electron at each copper atom in real space (r-space). Removing a small fraction of these electrons (hole doping) transforms this system into a superconducting fluid of delocalized Cooper pairs in momentum space (k-space). During this transformation, two distinctive classes of electronic excitations appear. At high energies, the mysterious ‘pseudogap’ excitations are found, whereas, at lower energies, Bogoliubov quasi-particles—the excitations resulting from the breaking of Cooper pairs—should exist. To explore this transformation, and to identify the two excitation types, we have imaged the electronic structure of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ in r-space and k-space simultaneously. We find that although the low-energy excitations are indeed Bogoliubov quasi-particles, they occupy only a restricted region of k-space that shrinks rapidly with diminishing hole density. Concomitantly, spectral weight is transferred to higher energy r-space states that lack the characteristics of excitations from delocalized Cooper pairs. Instead, these states break translational and rotational symmetries locally at the atomic scale in an energy-independent way. We demonstrate that these unusual r-space excitations are, in fact, the pseudogap states. Thus, as the Mott insulating state is approached by decreasing the hole density, the delocalized Cooper pairs vanish from k-space, to be replaced by locally translational- and rotational-symmetry-breaking pseudogap states in r-space. One of the enduring mysteries of the high-temperature copper oxide superconductors is the existence of a 'pseudogap' — that is, an energy gap resembling the one characterizing the superconducting state but which also appears in the non-superconducting state. Kohsaka et al. have looked in detail at the electronic excitations underlying the superconducting and pseudogap states, and find two very different types of behaviour: states in momentum space that correspond to the expected delocalised electron pairs responsible for superconductivity, and some unusual states localized in real space that correspond to the pseudogap. The relationship between these two excitation types provides a new perspective on the still enigmatic relationship between the pseudogap and superconductivity, and strengthens the conceptual connection with the properties of the insulating parent compounds, where electron localization in real space is central to their behaviour."

We report that untransformed mouse mammary cells that have been engineered to express the inducible oncogenic transgenes MYC and Kras D12 , or polyoma middle T, and introduced into the systemic circulation of a mouse can bypass transformation at the primary site and develop into metastatic pulmonary lesions upon immediate or delayed oncogene induction. Therefore, previously untransformed mammary cells may establish residence in the lung once they have entered the bloodstream and may assume malignant growth upon oncogene activation. Mammary cells lacking oncogenic transgenes displayed a similar capacity for long-term residence in the lungs but did not form ectopic tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2099390250,"The amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) plays a central pathophysiological role in Alzheimer's disease, but little is known about the concentration and dynamics of this secreted peptide in the extracellular space of the human brain. We used intracerebral microdialysis to obtain serial brain interstitial fluid (ISF) samples in 18 patients who were undergoing invasive intracranial monitoring after acute brain injury. We found a strong positive correlation between changes in brain ISF Aβ concentrations and neurological status, with Aβ concentrations increasing as neurological status improved and falling when neurological status declined. Brain ISF Aβ concentrations were also lower when other cerebral physiological and metabolic abnormalities reflected depressed neuronal function. Such dynamics fit well with the hypothesis that neuronal activity regulates extracellular Aβ concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1994513849,"The endogenous phospholipid l-alpha-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) was recently identified as a novel ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55). In this study we define the downstream signaling pathways activated by LPI in a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line engineered to stably express recombinant human GPR55. We find that treatment with LPI induces marked GPR55 internalization and stimulates a sustained, oscillatory Ca(2+) release pathway, which is dependent on Galpha13 and requires RhoA activation. We then establish that this signaling cascade leads to the efficient activation of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) family transcription factors and their nuclear translocation. Analysis of cannabinoid ligand activity at GPR55 revealed no clear effect of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol; however, the classical CB(1) antagonist AM251 evoked GPR55-mediated Ca(2+) signaling. Thus, LPI is a potent and efficacious ligand at GPR55, which is likely to be a key plasma membrane mediator of LPI-mediated signaling events and changes in gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2138878645,"Peroxisomes play a major role in human cellular lipid metabolism, including the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. The most frequent peroxisomal disorder is X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), which is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. The protein involved, called ABCD1, or alternatively ALDP, is a member of the ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporter family and is located in the peroxisomal membrane. The biochemical hallmark of X-ALD is the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), due to an impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Although this suggests a role of ALDP in VLCFA import, no experimental evidence is available to substantiate this. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, peroxisomes are the exclusive site of fatty acid beta-oxidation. Earlier work has shown that uptake of fatty acids into peroxisomes may occur via two routes, either as free fatty acids thus requiring intraperoxisomal activation into acyl-CoA esters or as long-chain acyl-CoA esters. The latter route involves the two peroxisomal half ABC transporters Pxa1p and Pxa2p that form a heterodimeric complex in the peroxisomal membrane. Using different strategies, including the analysis of intracellular acyl-CoA esters by tandem-MS, we show that the Pxa1p/Pxa2p heterodimer is involved in the transport of a spectrum of acyl-CoA esters. Interestingly, we found that the mutant phenotype of the pxa1/pxa2Delta mutant can be rescued, at least partially, by the sole expression of the human ABCD1 cDNA coding for ALDP, the protein that is defective in the human disease X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Our data indicate that ALDP can function as a homodimer and is involved in the transport of acyl-CoA esters across the peroxisomal membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2014573882,"How ion channels are gated to regulate ion flux in and out of cells is the subject of intense interest. The Escherichia coli mechanosensitive channel, MscS, opens to allow rapid ion efflux, relieving the turgor pressure that would otherwise destroy the cell. We present a 3.45 angstrom-resolution structure for the MscS channel in an open conformation. This structure has a pore diameter of approximately 13 angstroms created by substantial rotational rearrangement of the three transmembrane helices. The structure suggests a molecular mechanism that underlies MscS gating and its decay of conductivity during prolonged activation. Support for this mechanism is provided by single-channel analysis of mutants with altered gating characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W2031947612,"Subducting seamounts are thought to increase the normal stress between subducting and overriding plates. However, recent seismic surveys and laboratory experiments suggest that interplate coupling is weak. A seismic survey in the Japan Trench shows that a large seamount is being subducted near a region of repeating earthquakes of magnitude M approximately 7. Both observed seismicity and the pattern of rupture propagation during the 1982 M 7.0 event imply that interplate coupling was weak over the seamount. A large rupture area with small slip occurred in front of the seamount. Its northern bound could be determined by a trace of multiple subducted seamounts. Whereas a subducted seamount itself may not define the rupture area, its width may be influenced by that of the seamount."
https://openalex.org/W2033451549,"The mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) is a key determinant in the prokaryotic response to osmotic challenges. We determined the structural rearrangements associated with MscS activation in membranes, using functorial measurements, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and computational analyses. MscS was trapped in its open conformation after the transbilayer pressure profile was modified through the asymmetric incorporation of lysophospholipids. The transition from the closed to the open state is accompanied by the downward tilting of the transmembrane TM1-TM2 hairpin and by the expansion, tilt, and rotation of the TM3 helices. These movements expand the permeation pathway, leading to an increase in accessibility to water around TM3. Our open MscS model is compatible with single-channel conductance measurements and supports the notion that helix tilting is associated with efficient pore widening in mechanosensitive channels."

Our data reveal that the lower O 2 limit for combustion should be increased from 12 to 15%.

https://openalex.org/W1995478441,"Osteosarcoma is characterized by a high malignant and metastatic potential, which points to the need for new therapeutic strategies to prevent cell metastasis. In this study, we show that statin-induced HMG-CoA reductase inhibition reduces cell migration and invasion in human and murine osteosarcoma cells, independently of the genotype. The statin-induced reduction of cell migration and invasion was independent of induction of apoptosis and was geranylgeranylpyrophosphate-dependent. The statin reduced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, 9, and 14 and TIMP2 expression or activity in invading cells. Forced expression of MMP2 and MMP14 overcame the inhibitory effect of the statin on cell invasion, suggesting a role for these MMPs in invasive potential. We also investigated the mechanisms involved in the reduced MMP2 activity and cell invasion. Inhibition of JNK, but not ERK1/2 signaling, reduced MMP2 activity. Pharmacological or constitutive activation of JNK overcame the reduced MMP2 activity and cell invasion induced by the statin. The statin decreased JNK phosphorylation and c-Jun nuclear translocation, suggesting that HMG-CoA reductase inhibition targets the JNK-c-Jun signaling pathway. We showed that mevalonate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate treatment prevented the statin-induced reduction in JNK phosphorylation, MMP2 activity, and cell invasion. Forced expression of a constitutively active form of RhoA increased JNK phosphorylation and overcame the inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on MMP2 activity and cell invasion. The data establish a link between RhoA, JNK, c-Jun, and MMP2 activity that is functionally involved in the reduction in osteosarcoma cell invasion by the statin.

The cholesterol-lowering agents statins act as inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA into mevalonate.

However, the mechanisms by which RhoA inactivation may control MMPs and cell migration and invasion are not fully understood. In this study, we show that statin-induced inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase decreases cell migration and invasion in human and murine osteosarcoma cells through a mechanism involving inhibition of RhoA-JNK-c-Jun signaling and MMP2 activity. Our results thus implicate a role for JNK signaling in statin-induced inhibition of human cancer cell migration and invasion.

Farges M.F. de Novion H.S. Chompret A. Delpech B. Cattan N. Frenay M. Gioanni J. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Murine K7M2 (ATCC) derived from mouse osteosarcoma are highly tumorigenic in vivo (22Khanna C. Prehn J. Yeung C. Caylor J. Tsokos M. Helman L. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2000; 18: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Normal fetal human osteoblastic cells (FHSO6) were derived from the bone marrow stroma (23Fromigue O. Kheddoumi N. Lomri A. Marie P.J. Body J.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1600-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 units/ml and 10,000 μg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. The culture media were changed every 2 or 3 days. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (provided by Dr. Briquet-Laugier, Paris, France) were isolated by collagenase digestion. The umbilical cord was collected in sterile conditions, and the umbilical vein was washed with Ca2+-containing phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 10 min with 1 mg/ml type I collagenase. Cells were collected by flushing the vein with Ca2+-containing phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, plated onto gelatin-coated dishes, and cultured in endothelial cell medium (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany), supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Reagents and Antibodies—Atorvastatin was kindly provided by Dr. J. Feyen (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ). z-VAD-fmk, mevalonate, GGPP, FPP, U0126, and anisomycin were from Sigma. SP600125 was from Merck. Monoclonal antibodies raised against RhoA, phospho-ERK, phospho-JNK, and histone H1 were from Santa Cruz (Heidelberg, Germany). Monoclonal antibody raised against GAPDH and polyclonal antibody raised against MT1-MMP/MMP14 were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Monoclonal antibody raised against TIMP2 was from Biolegend (San Diego, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against MMP2 and MMP9 were from Cell Signaling (Ozyme, St. Quentin Fallavier, France). Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against β-actin was from Sigma. Plasmid Constructs—The pcDNA3/MKK7-JNK plasmid was obtained from Dr. Davis (Howard Hughes Medical Institute). The pEGFP/G14V-RhoA (constitutively active form) plasmid was obtained from Dr. Jurdic (Ecole Normale Superieure, Lyon, France). The pcHB/MMP2 and pcDNA3/MMP14 plasmids were obtained from Dr. Noel (University of Liege, Liege, Belgium). The AP1-Luc cis-reporting system was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Cell Migration and Invasion Assays—Cell migration was determined in the modified Boyden chamber assay, using cell culture inserts (8-μm pore; BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France) as previously described with minor modifications (24Orosco A. Fromigue O. Bazille C. Entz-Werle N. Levillain P. Marie P.J. Modrowski D. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3708-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (50,000 cells/insert) were preincubated 2 h with or without statin and/or z-VAD-fmk before seeding in inserts and incubated for further 22 h. The cells that did not migrate through the filter were removed from the upper surface of the membrane using cotton-tipped swabs. The cells migrated to the underside were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and stained with toluidine blue. The membranes were then cut from the insert and observed under microscope. Five fields were randomly selected and counted for each assay performed in duplicate. For in vitro cell invasion assay, similar experiments were performed using inserts coated with a basement membrane, Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Trans-endothelial migration was measured using inserts in which HUVEC were plated (150,000 cells/insert) and cultured up to confluence. Five fields were randomly selected and counted for each assay performed in duplicate, taking in account the migration of HUVEC, which were counted separately from migrating osteosarcoma cells. Cell Viability—Cell viability was determined as previously described (14Fromigue O. Hay E. Modrowski D. Bouvet S. Jacquel A. Auberger P. Marie P.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1845-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell viability was measured by the colorimetric microassay described by Mosmann (25Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45013) Google Scholar) Tetrazolium salt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was added to the culture medium for the last hour of incubation. The culture media were then removed, and the cells were lysed in Me2SO. Microplates were read using a multiwell scanning spectrophotometer (Titertek Elisa reader) at 540 nm. We used six replicates for each condition, and the experiments were repeated at least three times. Matrix Metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) Activity Assay—The cells were lysed in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween 80 on ice for 15 min. The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g to discard unsoluble materials. Total protein content was determined by a colorimetric assay using Bio-Rad protein dye and analyzed on spectrophotometer at 595 nm. MMP2 activity was evaluated by a colorimetric assay using Ac-Pro-Leu-Gly-[2-mercapto-4-methyl-pentanoyl]-Leu-Gly-OC2H5 thiopeptide (50 μm; BioMol International, Hamburg, Germany) in 50 mm Hepes, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, 0.05% Brij35, 1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) buffer according to the manufacturer's recommendations and corrected for total protein content. Matrix Metalloprotease 14 (MMP14) Activity Assay—The cell lysates were prepared using the Biotrak assay kit and analyzed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (GE Healthcare). Substrate Gel Analysis (Zymography)—Gelatinase activity was determined by zymography. The conditioned media were concentrated 10-fold using Centricon YM-10 columns (Millopore, St. Quentin en Yvelines, France; cut-off, 10 kDa), and equal protein samples were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin in the absence of reducing reagent. The gels were washed twice in 2.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% (w/v) Brij35 for 72 h at 37 °C under gentle agitation. The gels were finally stained with 0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 50% trichloroacetic acid and de-stained in 7% trichloroacetic acid. Cell Transfection—Transfections were performed using Exgen500 (Euromedex, Mundolsheim, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, the cells seeded at 25,000/cm2 were cultured for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and rinsed with serum-free DMEM and 1 ml of DMEM containing 7 equivalents of Exgen500, and 2 μg of the indicated construct was added. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum was added to the medium. After 24 h, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium. Subcellular Fractionation—The cells were incubated in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl for 10 min on ice before addition of Nonidet P-40 (1:16 of 10%, v/v). The lysates were centrifuged for 30 s at 12,000 × g to collect cytosolic fractions in supernatants. The pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.45 m NaCl, incubated for 15 min on a shaker, and centrifuged to eliminate insoluble material. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction using TriPure solution, according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France). Three μg of total RNA from each samples were reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers, at 37 °C for 90 min. The relative mRNA levels were evaluated by quantitative PCR using LightCycler Instrument (Roche Applied Science) and SYBR Green PCR kit (ABGen, Courtaboeuf, France). The signals were normalized to 18 S as internal control. The primers were as follows: forward, 5′-ATAACCTGGATGCCGTCGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGGCACCCTTGAAGAAGTAGC-3′ for MMP2; forward, 5′-GACAGGCAGCTGGCAGAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGGGACAGTTGCTTCTGG-3′ for MMP9; forward, 5′-CTGTCAGGAATGAGGATCTGAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGGGGTCACTGGAATGCTC-3′ for MMP14; forward, 5′-GAAGAGCCTGAACCACAGGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGGGGAGGAGATGTAGCAC-3′ for TIMP2; and forward, 5′-TCAAGAACGAAAGTCGGAGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGACATCTAAGGGCATCACA-3′ for 18 S. Western Blot Analysis—The cell lysates were prepared as previously described (14Fromigue O. Hay E. Modrowski D. Bouvet S. Jacquel A. Auberger P. Marie P.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1845-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins (30 μg) were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The filters were incubated at room temperature for 2 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (TBST/BSA) and then overnight at 4 °C on a shaker with specific primary antibodies (1/1000 in TBST/BSA). The membranes were washed twice with TBST and incubated for 2 h with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1/20,000 in TBST/BSA). After final washes, the signals were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagent (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiographic film (X-Omat AR; Eastman Kodak Co.). Densitometric analysis using ImageQuant software was performed following digital scanning (Agfa). Statistics—Differences between the mean values were analyzed using the statistical package super-analysis of variance (Macintosh, Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA) with a minimal significance of p < 0.05. Atorvastatin Reduces Osteosarcoma Cell Migration Independently of Its Pro-apoptotic Effect—We first compared the migratory potential of osteosarcoma cell lines with various genotypes to normal osteoblastic cells (FHSO6 cells) derived from fetal human bone marrow (23Fromigue O. Kheddoumi N. Lomri A. Marie P.J. Body J.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1600-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vitro cell migration was evaluated using modified Boyden's chambers. All of the cells were able to migrate although with different potential (Fig. 1A). SaOS2 cells showed the highest capacity to migrate, whereas MG63 cells showed the lowest migrating capacity. The normal cell line FHSO6 exhibited an intermediate potential. On this basis, we tested the effects of atorvastatin on SaOS2 cell migration potential. We found that atorvastatin reduced cell migration in a dose-dependent manner (-40% at 10 μm) (Fig. 1B). We then tested the effect of atorvastatin at the dose of 10 μm on cell migration. We found that the statin reduced cell migration in all human or murine osteosarcoma cell lines but did not modulate FHSO6 cell migration potential (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained with simvastatin (data not shown). We previously showed that atorvastatin reduces osteosarcoma cell viability by induction of caspases-dependent apoptosis (14Fromigue O. Hay E. Modrowski D. Bouvet S. Jacquel A. Auberger P. Marie P.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1845-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether the reduction in cell migration by the statin was related to apoptosis induction using co-treatment with a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk). The addition of 25 μm z-VAD-fmk fully prevented the reduction in cell viability induced by the statin (Fig. 1D) but did not significantly prevent the statin-induced inhibition of cell migration (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that atorvastatin reduces the in vitro cell migration potential of human and murine osteosarcoma cells, independently of the genotype or of its pro-apoptotic effect. Atorvastatin Reduces Osteosarcoma Cell Invasion Independently of Its Pro-apoptotic Effect—We next determined the effect of atorvastatin on in vitro cell invasion. To this goal, we used basement membrane Matrigel-coated transwells to mimic the extracellular matrix or transwells containing confluent HUVEC to mimic the endothelial barrier. As observed for in vitro cell migration, the osteosarcoma cell lines exhibited different invasion potential in basal condition. U2OS cells were the most invasive cells compared with other cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, MG63 cells showed no invasive potential neither through Matrigel basement membrane nor through HUVEC barrier (Fig. 2, A–C). Treatment with 10 μm atorvastatin reduced Matrigel cell invasion in all invading osteosarcoma cell lines (–55 to –85%, p < 0.05 versus untreated cells) but had no effect on basal invasive potential of normal human osteoblastic cells (Fig. 2B). The addition of 25 μm z-VAD-fmk did not prevent the effect of atorvastatin on cell invasion (Fig. 2B), indicating that the inhibitory effect of atorvastatin was independent of apoptosis. Atorvastatin had no effect on HUVEC cell viability (Fig. 2D) but reduced transendothelial cell invasion of all invading osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 2C). Again, as observed for migration and Matrigel invasion tests, no effect was observed in normal FHSO6 osteoblastic cells. These data show that atorvastatin reduces the number of osteosarcoma cell invading extracellular matrix (mimicked by Matrigel) or endothelial barrier (mimicked by HUVEC monolayer), whereas nontumoral osteoblastic cells were not sensitive to atorvastatin effects in terms of in vitro cell invasion potential. Atorvastatin Reduces the Expression and Activity of Several MMPs Family Members—We investigated the role of MMP2 and MMP9, which are believed to play an important role in the invasive process (26Deryugina E.I. Quigley J.P. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006; 25: 9-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). MMP2 is known to be activated in complexes including TIMP2 and MT1-MMP (MMP14) (27Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar, 28Maquoi E. Frankenne F.

Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis, we investigated the expression of these molecules in osteosarcoma cells under atorvastatin treatment. We found that atorvastatin reduced MMP2, MMP9, MMP14, and TIMP2 mRNA levels in U2OS cells (Fig. 3A). Similar results were found in other invading osteosarcoma cell lines (SaOS2, CAL72, and K7M2 cells; data not shown). Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced gelatinase activity, evaluated by zymography (Fig. 3B), and reduced MMP14 activity, evaluated by Biotrak system (Fig. 3C). Atorvastatin also reduced MMP2, MMP9, MMP14, and TIMP2 protein levels in U2OS (Fig. 3D) and in other invading osteosarcoma cell lines (SaOS2, CAL72, and K7M2 cells; data not shown), as evaluated by Western blot analysis. The reduction in MMP2 activity by the statin was dose-dependent in U2OS cells, whereas MG63 cells, which are noninvading cells, and FHSO6 cells, which are normal osteoblastic cells and poorly invading cells, were not affected (Fig. 3E). To further demonstrate the role of MMP2 in cell invasion, U2OS cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding MMP2 or MMP14. Forced expression of MMP2 and/or MMP14 abolished the inhibition of cell invasion induced by atorvastatin in these cells (Fig. 3F). These data indicate that atorvastatin reduces gelatinases expression and activity, notably MMP2, resulting in reduction in the invasive capacity in murine and human osteosarcoma cells. Reduced RhoA-GTPase Activity Is Involved in the Inhibition of Osteosarcoma Cell Invasion Potential by Atorvastatin—We previously showed that atorvastatin inhibits prenylation and consequently activity of RhoA-GTPase, triggering an apoptotic process (14Fromigue O. Hay E. Modrowski D. Bouvet S. Jacquel A. Auberger P. Marie P.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1845-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We thus evaluated the effect of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) repletion on the statin-induced inhibition of U2OS cell invasion. We found that the addition of 10 μm GGPP prevented the inhibition of in vitro cell invasion induced by the statin (Fig. 4A). To fully confirm the implication of RhoA-GTPase activity in the inhibition of cell invasiveness by atorvastatin, we transfected U2OS cells with a vector encoding a constitutively active form of RhoA (CA-RhoA). This vector warded off the reduction in GTP-bound (active) RhoA level (Fig. 4B) by statin, independently of the prenylation level or membranous localization. Forced expression of CA-RhoA also abolished the reduction in U2OS cell invasion induced by atorvastatin (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that atorvastatin inhibits osteosarcoma cell invasion through inhibition of RhoA-GTPase prenylation and activity. The Reduction in MMP2 Activity by Atorvastatin Is Dependent on RhoA-GTPase Activity—We then sought to determine the mechanisms underlying the reduction of MMP2 activity by atorvastatin in osteosarcoma cells. We first evaluated the role of RhoA-GTPase in the inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on MMP2 activity using GGPP (10 μm), FPP (10 μm), or mevalonate (10 mm) supplementation (14Fromigue O. Hay E. Modrowski D. Bouvet S. Jacquel A. Auberger P. Marie P.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1845-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We found that mevalonate or GGPP supplementation restored the basal MMP2 activity level in atorvastatin-treated U2OS cells, whereas FPP supplementation had no effect (Fig. 4D). Additionally, forced expression of CA-RhoA prevented the inhibition of MMP2 activity induced by the statin (Fig. 4E), further documenting the link between RhoA-GTPase and MMP2 activity. These data indicate that GGPP depletion and inhibition of RhoA-GTPase activity by atorvastatin mediates the reduced MMP2 activity in osteosarcoma cells. The Reduction in MMP2 Activity Is Mediated by Decreased JNK Signaling—We then investigated the signaling pathway involved in the reduction of MMP2 activity induced by the statin in osteosarcoma cells. We previously showed that reduced phosphoERK1/2 level is responsible for the pro-apoptotic effect of atorvastatin in osteosarcoma cells (14Fromigue O. Hay E. Modrowski D. Bouvet S. Jacquel A. Auberger P. Marie P.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1845-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this study, we used U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK, which efficiently reduced phospho-ERK1/2 (Fig. 5A) and phospho-JNK (Fig. 5B) protein levels, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5C, MMP2 activity was reduced by the JNK inhibitor (15 μm) but not by the MEK inhibitor (10 μm) in U2OS cells in basal conditions. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of JNK using anisomycin (0.01 μg/ml for the last 4 h) prevented the reduction in MMP2 activity by atorvastatin in U2OS cells (Fig. 5D). Similar effects were found in the other osteosarcoma cell lines (data not shown). These data further suggest a critical role for JNK signaling in statin-induced reduction in MMP2 activity. Consistently, transfection of a vector encoding both MKK7 and JNK, which triggered JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 5E), prevented the reduction in MMP2 activity induced by atorvastatin (Fig. 5F). To further confirm that JNK is a downstream target of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition in osteosarcoma cells, we investigated the change in translocation of c-Jun from the cytosol to the"

However, because it binds to a unique receptor, this cytokine may function cooperatively with IFN-α/β or IFN-γ during natural infections to inhibit virus replication, and might also be useful therapeutically in combination with other cytokines to treat chronic viral infections such as hepatitis C (HCV). We therefore investigated the ability of IL-29 and IFN-α or IFN-γ to cooperatively inhibit virus replication and induce antiviral gene expression. Compared with the individual cytokines alone, the combination of IL-29 with IFN-α or IFN-γ was more effective at blocking vesicular stomatitis virus and HCV replication, and this cooperative antiviral activity correlated with the magnitude of induced antiviral gene expression. Although the combined effects of IL-29 and IFN-α were primarily additive, the IL-29/IFN-γ combination synergistically induced multiple genes and had the greatest antiviral activity. Two different mechanisms contributed to the enhanced gene expression induced by the cytokine combinations: increased activation of ISRE promoter elements and simultaneous activation of both ISRE and GAS elements within the same promoter.

Progression of chronic HCV infections into late-stage liver disease has become the leading indication for liver transplants in the United States (2Verna E.C. Brown Jr., R.S. Clin. Liver Dis. 2006; 10: 919-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Current therapy for chronic HCV consists of pegylated interferon (IFN)-α and ribavirin (3Poynard T. Yuen M.F. Ratziu V. Lai C.L. Lancet. 2003; 362: 2095-2100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). However, IFN-α treatment is costly, poorly tolerated due to adverse side effects, and is often ineffective (3Poynard T. Yuen M.F. Ratziu V. Lai C.L.

A new family of IFN-related cytokines has recently been described and designated IL-29, IL-28A, and IL-28B (or IFN-λ1, -2, and -3, respectively) (4Kotenko S.V. Gallagher G. Baurin V.V. Lewis-Antes A.

Despite its functional similarity to IFN-α/β, IL-29 does not bind the IFN-α/β receptor, but instead signals through a receptor composed of the IL-28R1 and IL-10R2 subunits (4Kotenko S.V. Gallagher G.

Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Unlike the IFN-α receptor, which is expressed on nearly all somatic cells, the IL-29 receptor is widely expressed on nonhematopoietic cells but less so on leukocytes (12Donnelly R.P. Sheikh F. Kotenko S.V. Dickensheets H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recent studies in mice also indicate that IL-28A activity varies among different tissues, and is highest in epithelial cells (13Sommereyns C. Paul S. Staeheli P. Michiels T. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000017Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 14Ank N. Iversen M.B. Bartholdy C. Staeheli P. Hartmann R. Jensen U.B. Dagnaes-Hansen F. Thomsen A.R. Chen Z. Haugen H. Klucher K. Paludan S.R. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Both IFN-α/β and IFN-γ have antiviral functions, and they exert this activity by inducing the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Signaling through the IFN-α/β or IFN-γ receptor induces ISG expression via the formation of the transcription factor complexes interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3; STAT-1/STAT-2/IRF9) or γ-activated factor (STAT-1 homodimer), respectively (15Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). The IFN-activated transcription factors bind to highly conserved promoter elements upstream of ISGs. The IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) is found in the promoter of genes primarily activated by IFN-α/β, whereas the γ-activated sequence (GAS) is typically found upstream of genes induced by IFN-γ signaling (16Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Reich N. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 17Decker T. Lew D.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5147-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Like the IFN-α receptor, the IL-29 receptor also induces the phosphorylation of STAT proteins that subsequently bind to and activate ISREs (4Kotenko S.V. Gallagher G. Baurin V.V. Lewis-Antes A.

The fact that IL-29 binds a unique receptor, but this receptor signals through a pathway that is nearly identical to the IFN-α/β receptor, raises some interesting questions. Because IL-29 is coexpressed with IFN-α/β, these cytokines may elicit an antiviral response in combination greater than either one alone. Cooperative antiviral effects of IFN-α and IL-28/IL-29 against HCV (9Marcello T. Grakoui A. Barba-Spaeth G. Machlin E.S. Kotenko S.V. MacDonald M.R. Rice C.M.

Furthermore, IFN-α and IFN-γ synergistically inhibit the replication of a wide range of viruses including HCV (23Sainz Jr., B. Halford W.P. J.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2003; 23: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but this relationship has not been studied for IL-29 and IFN-γ. Therefore, we examined the ability of IL-29 to function cooperatively with IFN-α or IFN-γ to inhibit HCV replication, and characterized the mechanism of this combined activity. Cell Lines and Reagents—Human Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells expressing a genotype 1b HCV subgenomic replicon (Huh7/Con1/SG-Neo(I)) with the S1179I cell culture adaptive mutation (30Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) were maintained with 500 μg of G418/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin (100 μg/ml) and streptomycin (100 units/ml)), l-glutamine (2 mm), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The full-length replicon (SfiI) cells were cultured in the same manner. Human A549 lung carcinoma cells were maintained in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Human IL-29 (IFN-λ1) was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human IFN-α(A/D) and IFN-γ were purchased from PBL Interferon Source (Piscataway, NJ). VSV Infection Assay—A549 cells were treated with 5 units of IFN-α/ml, 5 units of IFN-γ/ml, 0.25 ng of IL-29/ml, or combinations at their respective concentrations for 18 h. Cells were infected with recombinant VSV-GFP (provided by J. Rose, Yale University) at a multiplicity of infection = 1 for 24 h, after which they were imaged using an Olympus CK40 inverted microscope outfitted with a DP12 digital camera, and then harvested in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for analysis by flow cytometry using a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). HCV Antiviral Assays—Huh7/Con1/SG-Neo(I) or SfiI cells were treated with IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-29, or combinations at the indicated concentrations for 72 h. Cytokines were replenished 48 h after the initial treatment. In the time course experiment, Huh7/Con1/SG-Neo(I) cells were treated with the cytokines at their indicated concentrations, and harvested at 1, 2, 3, or 5 days post treatment. Cytokines were replenished 2 and 4 days after the initial treatment. HCV RNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR, normalized to GAPDH expression, and expressed as relative to untreated control cultures. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was harvested and prepared using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR were performed as previously described (31van den Pol A.N. Robek M.D. Ghosh P.K. Ozduman K. Bandi P. Whim M.D. Wollmann G. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 332-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with random hexamers. Quantitative PCR was performed in duplicate using an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system. PCR mixtures contained 100 ng of reverse transcribed RNA, 12.5 μl of SYBR Green reaction mixture (Applied Biosystems), and 200 nm sense and antisense primers in a total volume of 25 μl. The primer sequences used were as follows: IFI27, 5′-CCG TAG TTT TGC CCC TGG-3′ (sense), 5′-CGA GGC CAT TCC CGC CGC-3′ (antisense); IFITM1, 5′-GGT TGG CGA CGT GAC CGG-3′ (sense), 5′-CCG AAT ACC AGT GAC AGG-3′ (antisense); GAPDH, 5′-AAG TAT GAC AAC AGC CTC AAG ATC-3′ (sense), 5′-CTG TGG TCA TGA GTC CTT C-3′ (antisense); HCV, 5′-AAG CCA GCT CGC CTT ATC GTA TT-3′ (sense), 5′-ACC CGC TGT CCA GGA GAG TAT TG-3′ (antisense). After an initial incubation at 95 °C for 5 min, PCR amplification was performed by cycling 50 times for 30 s at 95 °C followed by 1 min at 60 °C. Gene expression was quantified using the 7500 system Sequence Detection Software (Applied Biosystems) after normalization to GAPDH expression. The ΔΔCt method was used for analysis of all quantitative RT-PCRs. In a previous report (8Robek M.D. Boyd B.S. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3851-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), we found similar inhibition of HCV RNA by IL-29 measured by quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses. Therefore, quantitative RT-PCR was used exclusively in these studies. Cytotoxicity and Proliferation Assay—Huh7/Con1/SG-Neo(I) cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells/well) in triplicate 1 day prior to treatment. Cells were treated for 72 h with 100 units of IFN-α/ml, 100 units of IFN-γ/ml, 10 ng of IL-29/ml, or combinations at these concentrations in 200 μl of media. Following treatment, 100 μl of media was removed from each well and 25 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, Sigma) was added. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before adding 50 μl of 20% SDS in 50% N,N-dimethylformamide (pH 4.7) to solubilize the crystals. After incubating at 37 °C overnight, the absorbance at 570 nm was measured. Alternatively, cells were resuspended, diluted in Trypan blue solution (0.4%, Sigma), and counted using a hemacytometer. Gene Expression Analysis—Huh7/Con1/SG-Neo(I) cells were treated with 100 units of IFN-α/ml, 100 units of IFN-γ/ml, 10 ng of IL-29/ml, or combinations at their respective concentrations for 24 h. These concentrations were chosen because they induced greater inhibition of HCV replication in combination (Fig. 2C), are similar in terms of antiviral activity per ng (5Sheppard P. Kindsvogel W. Xu W. Henderson K. Schlutsmeyer S. Whitmore T.E. Kuestner R. Garrigues U. Birks C. Roraback J. Ostrander C. Dong D. Shin J. Presnell S. Fox B. Haldeman B. Cooper E. Taft D. Gilbert T. Grant F.J.

Virol. 1981; 37: 755-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and induced similar expression levels of representative genes (MXA, ISG15) when used alone (data not shown). Total cellular RNA from three experiments was collected using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and RNA concentration and quality were determined by absorbance spectrophotometry and electrophoresis. Prior to the microarray analysis, control RT-PCR was performed on the individual samples to confirm similar induced expression of the representative ISGs MXA and ISG15. The RNA from three separate experiments was pooled, and cRNA was prepared according to the Affymetrix GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) protocol at the Keck Affymetrix Resource facility at Yale University. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using the Superscript Choice System (Invitrogen) with an oligo(dT)24 T7 primer (Genset, La Jolla, CA). Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription from cDNA using GeneChip IVT labeling, then purified with the GeneChip Cleanup Module before fragmentation. Fragmented cRNA was then hybridized to the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, and processing was performed following standard protocols (Affymetrix). Raw Affymetrix microarray data were normalized using Robust Multichip Averaging (33Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Astrand M. Speed T.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar). Differential expression was determined for each comparison of interest using two criteria. First, an initial filtering removed any genes with an absolute -fold change less than two. Next, statistical significance was calculated using the S-Score probe-level algorithm (34Kennedy R.E. Archer K.J. Miles M.F. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 154Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 35Kennedy R.E. Kerns R.T. Kong X. Archer K.J. Miles M.F. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1272-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A change in expression at least three standard deviations from the mean, corresponding to a p value of 0.003, was required. All of the analysis methods used implementations from the BioConductor software package (36Gentleman R.C. Carey V.J. Bates D.M. Bolstad B. Dettling M. Dudoit S. Ellis B. Gautier L. Ge Y. Gentry J. Hornik K. Hothorn T. Huber W. Iacus S. Irizarry R. Leisch F. Li C. Maechler M. Rossini A.J. Sawitzki G. Smith C. Smyth G. Tierney L. Yang J.Y. Zhang J. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). STAT Phosphorylation Analysis—Huh7/Con1/SG-Neo(I) cells were treated with cytokines for 30 min in two separate groups. The first group was treated with 100 units of IFN-α/ml, 100 units of IFN-γ/ml, 10 ng of IL-29/ml, or combinations at these concentrations. The second group was treated with 100 units of IFN-α/ml, 10 units of IFN-γ/ml, 100 ng of IL-29/ml or combinations at these concentrations. Equal numbers of cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). Extracts were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with antibodies specific for p-STAT-1 (Tyr-701), STAT-1, p-STAT-2 (Tyr-690), STAT-2, p-STAT-3 (Tyr-705), and STAT-3 (Cell Signaling). Proteins were visualized using LumiGLO chemiluminescent reagents (Cell Signaling) and a Fuji LAS-3000 cooled CCD camera. Promoter Activity/Luciferase Assay—The pISRE-Luc plasmid containing five copies of an ISRE element (TAGTTTCACTTTCCC) and the pGAS-Luc plasmid containing four copies of a GAS element (AGTTTCATATTACTCTAAATC) were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). One day prior to transfection, cells were plated in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics. Huh7/Con1/SG-Neo(I) cells were transfected with 2 μg of control plasmid containing no enhancer element, pISRE-luc, or pGAS-luc plasmid with 6 μl of Lipofectin (Invitrogen). One day post-transfection, cells were treated with 100 units of IFN-α/ml, 100 units of IFN-γ/ml, 10 ng of IL-29/ml, or combinations at their respective concentrations for 24 h. Cells were lysed in 1× lysis buffer (Stratagene) and luciferase assays were performed using the Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was quantified using a Victor3V Luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). IFI27 Promoter Cloning and Mutagenesis—A 500-bp region immediately upstream of the IFI27 transcription start site was amplified by PCR and incorporated XhoI and HindIII restriction sites (5′-CTC GAG TCT GCC TAG GTC ACT GCT TC-3′ and 5′-AAG CTT GAC ACA GGC AAC AAA TGA GAT AG-3′). This region was then cloned into the pGL3 vector (Promega) for use in luciferase assays as described above. For the IFI27 mutant promoter, point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Primers were designed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (5′-GAT GTC TGC AGT TTC GGT TTC GTC CAA AAT GAA ACC TAT CTC ATT-3′ (sense); 5′-AAT GAG ATA GGT TTC ATT TTC GAC GAA ACC GAA ACT GCA GAC ATC-3′ (antisense)). For the IFI27 promoter luciferase assays, Huh7/Con1/SG-Neo(I) cells were transfected as described above, then treated with 10 units of IFN-α/ml, 100 units of IFN-γ/ml, 10 ng of IL-29/ml, or combinations for 8 h. Luciferase activity was measured as described above. Analysis of ISRE and GAS Elements—Upstream 1-kb promoter regions for all RefSeq genes in the human genome (Build 36) were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (37Kent W.J. Sugnet C.W. Furey T.S. Roskin K.M. Pringle T.H. Zahler A.M. Haussler D. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (6870) Google Scholar). Elements matching the ISRE ((G/A)(G/A)AANNGAAA(C/G)) and GAS (TT(C/A)CNNNAA(A/G)) consensus sequences were identified in each gene and their locations noted. p values for the over-representation of ISRE and/or GAS elements among the additive/synergistic genes were computed using hypergeometric distribution with the set of all differentially expressed genes under any interferon treatment as the background (38Barash Y. Bejerano G. Friedman N. Gascuel O. Moret B.M.E. Algorithms in Bioinformatics. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg2001: 278-293Google Scholar). Cooperative Antiviral Activity of IL-29 with IFN-α or IFN-γ—We first determined if combining IL-29 with IFN-α or IFN-γ induces greater antiviral activity compared with the individual cytokines alone. We initially chose to use VSV for these experiments because of its well characterized sensitivity to IFN (32Rubinstein S. Familletti P.C. Pestka S. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 755-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A549 cells were pre-treated with low concentrations of IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-29, or combinations for 18 h prior to infection with a GFP-expressing VSV (multiplicity of infection = 1) (39Ramsburg E. Publicover J. Buonocore L. Poholek A. Robek M. Palin A. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 15043-15053Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). By flow cytometric analysis 24 h post infection, we observed three populations of cells (arbitrarily defined as GFP high, medium, and low/no), indicative of their relative level of VSV gene expression (Fig. 1). We have previously found that GFP expression in VSV-infected cells correlates with virus titer in the cell culture supernatant (data not shown). Although cells treated with only one cytokine displayed some protection (i.e. lower GFP expression) against VSV at these concentrations, increased protection was found in cells treated with multiple cytokines. Although the combination of IL-29 and IFN-α induced a modest decrease in the level of GFP expression, the combination of IL-29 and IFN-γ was much more effective at inhibiting VSV, and was similar to the inhibition found with a combination of IFN-α and IFN-γ. Therefore, the combined antiviral activity of IL-29 and IFN-γ against VSV is more effective than the combination of IL-29 and IFN-α. We next determined the extent to which the cytokine combinations inhibit HCV. We chose to use the replicon model of HCV replication to monitor the effects of the cytokine combinations in the context of ongoing viral RNA replication. Human Huh7 hepatoma cells expressing either a subgenomic (30Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) or full-length genomic (40Kapadia S.B. Chisari F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2561-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) cell culture-adapted HCV RNA replicon were treated with the individual cytokines or combinations as indicated (Fig. 2A), and HCV RNA replication was measured 72 h later by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. These cytokine concentrations were chosen based on the fact that they elicit similar partial antiviral effects (∼3-fold HCV RNA reduction 3 days post treatment) when used alone (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the individual cytokines, viral RNA levels in the subgenomic replicon cells were reduced 92 and 98% by the IL-29/IFN-α and IL-29/IFN-γ combinations, respectively, and these decreases were significantly greater than the inhibition induced by each cytokine alone (Fig. 2A). A similar pattern was observed with cells expressing the full-length genomic replicon, as the combinations of IL-29/IFN-α and IL-29/IFN-γ reduced viral RNA levels by 91 and 97%, respectively. The enhanced inhibition elicited by the IL-29/IFN-α combination was not significantly different from a theoretical additive effect of the two cytokines (Z = X + Y (1 - X), where X and Y are the individual reductions, p value for synergy = 0.38 (subgenomic) or 0.33 (full-length)) (41Prichard M.N. Shipman Jr., C. Antiviral Res. 1990; 14: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). However, the decrease in HCV RNA evoked by the IL-29/IFN-γ combination was greater than that expected by an additive effect of the cytokines (p value for synergy = 0.016 (subgenomic) or 0.04"
https://openalex.org/W2171496699,"The time lag between intrusion of fresh, hot magma and an ensuing eruption is of critical importance in both understanding the triggering and mitigating the consequences of volcanic eruptions. This work looks at material erupted during 1925‐28 at the Nea Kameni volcanic center in Santorini, Greece, to determine this time scale. By exploiting Fe-Mg diffusion in olivine crystals, we constrained the intrusion-to-eruption time lag to between 3 and 10 weeks. These techniques have potential application at many volcanic centers; previously erupted material can be used to calibrate records of the short‐time scale processes common to many volcanic centers."
https://openalex.org/W2018634307,"Full activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) requires phosphorylation on Thr-308 and Ser-473. It is well established that Thr-308 is phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Ser-473 phosphorylation is mediated by both mammalian target of rapamycin-rictor complex (mTORC2) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) depending on type of stimulus. However, the physiological role of DNA-PK in the regulation of PKB phosphorylation remains to be established. To address this, we analyzed basal, insulin-induced, and DNA damage-induced PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation in DNA-PK catalytic subunit-null DNA-PKcs-/- mice. Our results revealed that DNA-PK is required for DNA damage-induced phosphorylation but dispensable for insulin- and growth factor-induced PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation. Moreover, DNA-PKcs-/- mice showed a tissue-specific increase in basal PKB phosphorylation. In particular, persistent PKB hyperactivity in the thymus apparently contributed to spontaneous lymphomagenesis in DNA-PKcs-/- mice. Significantly, these tumors could be prevented by deletion of PKBα. These findings reveal stimulus-specific regulation of PKB activation by specific upstream kinases and provide genetic evidence of PKB deregulation in DNA-PKcs-/- mice. Full activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) requires phosphorylation on Thr-308 and Ser-473. It is well established that Thr-308 is phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Ser-473 phosphorylation is mediated by both mammalian target of rapamycin-rictor complex (mTORC2) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) depending on type of stimulus. However, the physiological role of DNA-PK in the regulation of PKB phosphorylation remains to be established. To address this, we analyzed basal, insulin-induced, and DNA damage-induced PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation in DNA-PK catalytic subunit-null DNA-PKcs-/- mice.

Activation of PKB requires phosphorylation at two key regulatory sites as follows: Thr-308 and Ser-473 (of PKBα). Phosphorylation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) occurs on Thr-308 in the activation loop of PKB. The phosphorylation on Ser-473 within a C-terminal hydrophobic motif leads to full activation of PKB. The mTOR-rictor complex (mTORC2), a member of the PI3K-related kinase (PIKK) family, has been reported to regulate Ser-473 phosphorylation (13Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M.

Significantly, it was shown that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a further member of the PIKK family, also regulates PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation (9Feng J. Park J. Cron P. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41189-41196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In addition, a role for DNA-PK in the activation of PKB by CpG-DNA has been established using bone marrow-derived macrophages (17Dragoi A.M. Fu X. Ivanov S. Zhang P. Sheng L. Wu D. Li G.C. Chu W.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bozulic et al. (8Bozulic L. Surucu B. Hynx D. Hemmings B.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that DNA-PK phosphorylates PKB Ser-473 upon induction of DNA double strand breaks. However, the regulation of PKB by DNA-PK under physiological conditions remained to be established. This study made use of genetically modified mouse models to investigate PKB regulation by DNA-PK, as phosphorylation of Ser-473 may be stimulus-, signaling pathway-, and/or cell type-specific. DNA-PK is composed of a 470-kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and the Ku antigen complex (Ku80/Ku70) and involved in V(D)J recombination, repair of DNA double strand breaks by nonhomologous end joining, apoptosis, and transcription regulation (18Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA ends produced by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs activate DNA-PK, which is a primary sensor of DNA damage (19Burma S. Chen D.J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs-/- mice display growth retardation, hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, and severe immunodeficiency (20Gao Y.

Because of defects in V(D)J recombination, the development of T and B cells is blocked at an early progenitor stage in DNA-PKcs-/- mice. Moreover, DNA-PKcs-/- thymus has decreased cellularity and displays hypotrophy. Furthermore, DNA-PKcs-/- mice display an increased rate of T cell lymphoma (23Espejel S. Martin M. Klatt P. Martin-Caballero J. Flores J.M. Blasco M.A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Studies of mutant mice carrying a null mutation for each of the three PKB isoforms PKBα, PKBβ, and PKBγ revealed differing phenotypes, some of which are shared by DNA-PKcs-/- mice. Similar to DNA-PKcs-/- mice, PKBα-/- mice display growth retardation and hypersensitivity to DNA damage (24Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R.

Deletion of PKBβ and PKBγ isoforms revealed that a single functional allele of PKBα is sufficient for mouse development and survival (35Dummler B. Tschopp O. Hynx D. Yang Z.Z. Dirnhofer S.

In this study, we investigated the role of DNA-PK in basal, insulin-induced, and DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of PKB Ser-473 under physiological conditions. We report that DNA-PK phosphorylated PKB on Ser-473 upon DNA damage induced by γ-irradiation in vivo. In contrast, DNA-PK was dispensable for insulin and growth factor-induced PKB activation. Interestingly, analysis of basal PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation in DNA-PKcs-/- mice showed tissue-specific deregulation of the PKB/FoxO pathway. In particular, we provide evidence that persistent PKB hyperactivity in the thymus apparently contributes to spontaneous thymic lymphomagenesis in DNA-PKcs-/- mice. Lymphomagenesis could be prevented by the deletion of PKBα and implies deregulation of PKB in DNA-PKcs-/- thymi. Mice—DNA-PKcs-/- mice (20Gao Y. Chaudhuri J. Zhu C. Davidson L. Weaver D.T. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1998; 9: 367-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Prof. Fredrick Alt (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School). PKBα-/- mice were described previously (27Yang Z.Z. Tschopp O. Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Feng J. Brodbeck D. Perentes E. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32124-32131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). For the generation of DNA-PKcs-/-PKBα-/- mice, DNA-PKcs-/- mice were mated with PKBα-/- mice, and the resulting DNA-PKcs+/-PKBα+/- progeny intercrossed. All mice had a C57BL/6;129 mixed background. Mice were housed according to Swiss Animal Protection legislation under specific pathogen-free conditions. All procedures were conducted with the approval of the appropriate authorities. Cell Culture and Treatments—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For IGF-1 and serum stimulation, MEFs were starved overnight prior to treatment with IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) or serum (10% fetal calf serum) for the indicated times. Western Blot Analysis—Protein lysates were prepared by homogenization of various organs in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μm microcystin LR). Homogenates were centrifuged twice (13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C) to remove cell debris. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by 6, 8, or 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Antibodies against phospho-PKB (Ser-473), phospho-PKB (Thr-308), phospho-Foxo4 (Ser-193), phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9), phospho-S6K (Thr-389), and phospho-PKC (Ser-657) were purchased from Cell Signaling. PKCα antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-FoxO3 (Thr-32) and IRS-1 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc./Millipore. DNA-PKcs (Ab-4) and actin (Ab-5) antibodies were from NeoMarkers. PKBα isoform-specific antibody and PKB antibody Ab10 were previously described (27Yang Z.Z. Tschopp O. Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Feng J.

Anti-TSC2 antibody was generated as described previously (37van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by K. Molle (Biozentrum, University of Basel, Switzerland). A rat monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (YL1/2)-producing hybridoma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Quantification was performed using ImageQuant TL (Amersham Biosciences) software. In Vivo Insulin Stimulation—Insulin stimulation was performed on ∼3-month-old DNA-PKcs-/- mice and wild-type controls (n = 8). Following an overnight fast, a bolus of insulin (1 unit/kg of body weight; human recombinant insulin; Sigma) or saline solution was injected via the inferior vena cava into terminally anesthetized mice. White adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, and heart were collected 20 min after stimulation and immediately snap-frozen. Tissues were homogenized and lysed as described above. Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests—Three-month-old mice were fasted overnight (n = 2 for wild-type; n = 5 for DNA-PKcs-/-). For glucose tolerance tests, glucose (2 g/kg of body weight; d-(+)-glucose anhydrous; Fluka) was given orally, and for insulin tolerance tests, insulin (1 unit /kg; human recombinant insulin, Sigma) was administered by intraperitoneal injection as described previously (35Dummler B. Tschopp O. Hynx D. Yang Z.Z. Dirnhofer S. Hemmings B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8042-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Blood samples were collected at the indicated times from tail veins, and glucose levels were determined using Glucometer Elite (Bayer). Total Body γ-Irradiation of Mice—Mice received a single exposure of 1 Gy total body irradiation with x-rays (Asteophysics Research Corp., TORREX 120D x-ray system). The tissues were collected after 30 min and immediately snap-frozen. Tissues were homogenized and lysed as described above. Flow Cytometry—Thymocytes in suspension were stained at 4 °C for 30 min in FACS buffer (2% fetal calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline) with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies to CD4 and CD8 cell-surface markers. Antibodies were from Immunotools. Histological Analysis—Organs were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. After dehydration in ethanol, samples were embedded in paraffin. Tissues were cut into 4-μm-thick sections and stored for staining. For hematoxylin-eosin (Sigma) staining, sections were deparaffinized and stained. Statistics—Data are provided as arithmetic means ± S.E., and n represents the number of independent experiments. Data were tested for significance using one-way analysis of variance. The p values for the Kaplan-Meier survival curve were determined by LogRank tests with the Holm-Sidak multiple comparisons procedure using SigmaStat 3.11 (Systat Software, Inc.) statistics software. Results at p < 0.05 were considered significant. In Vivo, DNA-PK Is Dispensable for PKB Ser-473 Phosphorylation upon Insulin Stimulation—To evaluate the involvement of DNA-PK in the regulation of PKB in response to insulin stimulation, we treated wild-type and DNA-PKcs-/- mice with insulin. The mice were fasted overnight and then injected with a bolus of insulin (1 unit /kg body weight) or a saline control. Twenty minutes after injection, liver, skeletal muscle, adipose, and heart tissues were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. PKB Ser-473 was robustly (∼20-fold for liver; ∼25-fold for skeletal muscle and heart; ∼10-fold for adipose tissue; data not shown) phosphorylated upon insulin stimulation in all four tissues from both wild-type and DNA-PKcs-/- mice (Fig. 1, A–D). Thus, we concluded that DNA-PK is dispensable for insulin-induced PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation in vivo. Additionally, we treated wild-type and DNA-PKcs-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with IGF-1 (Fig. 1E) or serum (Fig. 1F). Neither treatment resulted in impaired PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation in DNA-PKcs-/- MEFs, indicating that DNA-PK is not essential for PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation upon IGF-1 or serum stimulation. To investigate the role of DNA-PK in the maintenance of glucose metabolism, mice fasted overnight were subjected to an insulin or glucose tolerance test. To evaluate insulin sensitivity, insulin (1 unit/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and blood glucose levels measured at the indicated time points. No significant differences in blood glucose levels were found between DNA-PKcs-/- mice and wild-type controls (Fig. 2A). After oral application of glucose (2 g/kg), blood glucose levels were measured at the indicated times. Wild-type and DNA-PKcs-/- mice displayed a similar response to the glucose treatment (Fig. 2B). Hence, DNA-PKcs-/- mice display neither insulin resistance nor glucose intolerance. Taken together, the results show that DNA-PK is dispensable for PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation in response to insulin and growth factor stimulation and is also not essential for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. DNA-PK Is the Physiological PKB Ser-473 Kinase upon γ-Irradiation-induced DNA Damage—DNA-PK is activated by DNA double strand breaks induced by γ-irradiation and radiomimetic drugs (18Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 19Burma S. Chen D.J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of DNA-PK in PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation induced by γ-irradiation, we analyzed the PKB response to DNA damage in MEFs. Phosphorylation of PKB was promoted in wild-type MEFs in a dose-dependent manner (∼4-fold for 5 Gy and 5-fold for 10 Gy), whereas this response was significantly impaired (p = 0.0017 for 5 Gy and p < 0.001 for 10 Gy) in DNA-PKcs-/- MEFs (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the levels of phosphorylated FoxO4 Ser-193 also increased in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a peak at 10 Gy (Fig. 3A). Further increase in DNA damage at 15 Gy irradiation led to compromised PKB and FoxO4 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), which is reminiscent of the dependence of PKB activation on the extent of DNA damage. Further analysis showed that the phosphorylation of PKB Ser-473 and FoxO4 Ser-193 remained impaired in DNA-PKcs-/- MEFs compared with WT MEFs at additional time points analyzed (Fig. 3B). Subsequently, we investigated DNA-PK-dependent PKB activation induced by γ-radiation in vivo. Wild-type and DNA-PKcs-/- mice were subjected to 1 Gy total body irradiation, and tissues were collected after 30 min. PKB was phosphorylated on both Thr-308 and Ser-473 (∼3.5-fold) in the brains of wild-type animals upon γ-irradiation. Strikingly, this activation was compromised in the DNA-PKcs-/- brain (Fig. 3B). Likewise, levels of phosphorylated FoxO4 increased in wild-type irradiated brain (∼18-fold), whereas there was no induction of FoxO4 phosphorylation in DNA-PKcs-/--irradiated brain (Fig. 3B). Immunoblot analysis with an antibody that preferentially recognizes the unphosphorylated form (because of the fact that the peptides used for production of the antibodies against phosphoprotein and total protein were derived from the same sequence) showed a decrease in total FoxO4 protein upon irradiation. This indicates a robust phosphorylation of FoxO4 Ser-193 upon DNA damage (Fig. 3B). In summary, in vivo and ex vivo results both indicate that PKB activation is promoted and that DNA-PK is required for phosphorylation of PKB Ser-473 in response to DNA damage induced by γ-irradiation. Overall, this implies stimulus-specific regulation of PKB activation by DNA-PK. PKB Is Hyperactivated in DNA-PKcs-/- Thymus—To investigate how loss of DNA-PK is reflected in basal PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation, we analyzed a panel of tissues from wild-type and DNA-PKcs-/- mice. No differences were observed in skeletal muscle, liver, spleen, and brain (supplemental Fig. 1A), and a mild increase was found in adipose and brown fat (∼2- and 2.5-fold, respectively) (Fig. 4, A and B). However, a robust 8-fold increase in PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation was found in DNA-PKcs-/- thymus compared with wild-type (Fig. 4C). p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), acting downstream of PKB, has been shown to repress upstream signaling by induction of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) degradation (38Harrington L.S.

In contrast, neither the phosphorylation of S6K1 on the hydrophobic motif residue Thr-389 nor the IRS-1 protein levels were significantly different in DNA-PKcs-/- and wild-type thymus and adipose (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. 1B). Hence, we concluded that the increased PKB activity in the DNA-PKcs null background was not because of defective S6K/IRS-1-mediated feedback regulation in these tissues. Interestingly, in some cases we observed increase of both S6K Thr-389 phosphorylation as well as IRS-1 protein levels in DNA-PKcs-/- brown fat (supplemental Fig. 1B). The marked increase in PKB phosphorylation upon loss of an upstream kinase prompted us to further investigate components of the PKB signaling pathway in DNA-PKcs-/- thymus. Further analysis of PKB downstream targets revealed that there was no significant difference in GSK3β Ser-9 phosphorylation, whereas the FoxO4 transcription factor was strongly phosphorylated in DNA-PKcs-/- thymus compared with the wild type. This suggests that the PKB/FoxO pathway is deregulated in DNA-PKcs-/- thymus (Fig. 4C). Constitutive PKB Activity Contributes to the Development of Spontaneous Thymic Lymphomas in DNA-PKcs-/- Mice and Can Be Prevented by Deletion of PKBα—PKB deregulation has been implicated in various types of cancer, including thymic lymphoma (41Yang Z.Z.

Transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active PKB in T cells develop T cell lymphomas (42Jones R.G. Parsons M. Bonnard M. Chan V.S. Yeh W.C. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp.

Blasco M.A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we observed an increased frequency of thymic lymphomas in DNA-PKcs-/- mice (Fig. 5A). Thymic tumors already appeared in 3-month-old animals and were 30-fold larger than nonmalignant DNA-PKcs-/- thymi (0.010 ± 0.001 g versus 0.313 ± 0.106 g; p = 0.03) (Table 1). PKBα is highly expressed in thymocytes particularly at the early stages of development (28Fayard E. Gill J. Paolino M. Hynx D. Hollander G.A.

Reasoning that persistent PKB activity in DNA-PKcs-/- thymus might contribute to thymic lymphoma formation, we investigated whether deletion of PKBα, prevented formation of thymic tumors in DNA-PKcs-/- mice. About 27% (6/22) of DNA-PKcs-/- mice aged 3–7 months displayed thymic tumors, as against zero in wild-type mice (0/14) (Fig. 5A). Significantly, none of the DNA-PKcs-/-PKBα-/- double knock-out (DKO) mice analyzed at 2–15 months (0/6) exhibited thymic tumors (Fig. 5A). The analysis of DNA-PKcs-/-PKBα-/- DKO mice over a wide age range ruled out delayed progression of thymic tumors. Further immunoblot analysis of DNA-PKcs-/-PKBα-/- DKO thymi revealed that elevated PKB Ser-473 and FoxO phosphorylation in DNA-PKcs-/- thymi were restored to wild-type levels with deletion of PKBα (Fig. 5B). This suggests that increased PKB and FoxO phosphorylation in DNA-PKcs-/- thymi is because of deregulation of PKBα. In line with previous reports (23Espejel S. Martin M."

The recruitment and retention of DNA repair factors in foci is mediated by a complex network of protein-protein interactions; however, the mechanisms of focus disassembly remain to be defined. Mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1) is an early and key component of the genome surveillance network activated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we investigated the disassembly of MDC1 foci. First, we show that ubiquitylation directs the MDC1 protein for proteasome-dependent degradation. Ubiquitylated MDC1 associates with chromatin before and after exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (IR). In addition, increased MDC1 ubiquitylation in the chromatin fraction is observed in response to IR, which is correlated with a reduction in total MDC1 protein levels. We demonstrate that blocking MDC1 degradation by proteasome inhibitors leads to a persistence of MDC1 foci. Consistent with this observation, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments reveal increased MDC1 protein at site-specific DSBs. Interestingly, we show that the persistence of MDC1 foci is associated with an abrogated recruitment of the downstream factor BRCA1 in a manner that is RNF8 independent. Collectively, the evidence presented here supports a novel mechanism for the disassembly of MDC1 foci via ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation, which appears to be a key step for the efficient assembly of BRCA1 foci.

Alterations in the cellular response to DSBs often result in genomic instability, which may contribute to the development of malignancies (4MacNeill S.A. Curr.

To avoid the deleterious consequences of unrepaired DSBs, cells have developed a complicated signaling network to coordinate the activation of the DNA repair machinery and delay of cell cycle progression. One important aspect that determines the effectiveness of the DSB response is the recruitment of pathway components to nuclear regions containing the damaged DNA (6Lukas J. Lukas C. Bartek J. DNA Repair (Amst). 2004; 3: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), which is a highly conserved process throughout evolution (7Lisby M. Rothstein R. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cytological manifestation of nuclear redistribution is the formation of socalled foci (8Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev.

Recent evidence has suggested that the assembly and retention of checkpoint and repair protein foci appears to be largely controlled by a network of protein-protein interactions (14Lou Z.

The discovery of ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation has led to the recognition of cellular proteolysis as a central area of research in biology (17Nissen S. Fuller Jr., J.C. Sell J. Ferket P.R. Rives D.V. Poult. Sci. 1994; 73: 137-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18von Mikecz A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1977-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The majority of intracellular proteins are proteolyzed by the proteasome. In most cultured mammalian cells, ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation accounts for 80–90% of protein breakdown (18von Mikecz A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1977-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome system covalently modifies target proteins by the attachment of a 76-amino acid ubiquitin to lysine residue(s) of the target. The elongated poly-ubiquitination chain signals the target protein for proteasome-mediated degradation (18von Mikecz A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1977-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Typically, lysine 48 (K48)-linked polyubiquitin chains target conjugated proteins to the proteasome for degradation, although in recent years it has been shown that ubiquitylation of a target protein may also have other consequences (18von Mikecz A.

Mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1) is an early and critical mediator of the DSB response pathway. It contains an amino-terminal FHA (forkhead-associated) domain and a tandem repeat of BRCT (breast cancer susceptibility gene-1 C terminus) domains, which are frequently found in DNA damage response proteins (33Shang Y.L.

Biol. 2005; 12: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Data demonstrating that MDC1 knockdown almost completely inhibited IR-induced BRCA1 focus formation suggests that MDC1 is critical for BRCA1 recruitment in response to DSBs (39Lou Z. Chini C.C. Minter-Dykhouse K. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13599-13602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recently, several laboratories have shown that MDC1 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8, thereby mediating ubiquitin conjugation of H2A/H2AX, which is required for BRCA1 focus accumulation at sites of damaged DNA (36Kolas N.K. Chapman J.R. Nakada S. Ylanko J. Chahwan R. Sweeney F.D. Panier S. Mendez M. Wildenhain J. Thomson T.M. Pelletier L. Jackson S.P. Durocher D.

A. 2007; 104: 20759-20763Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, whether RNF8-mediated ubiquitylation of H2A/H2AX is the sole mechanism that controls damage-induced BRCA1 recruitment remains unknown. It has been suggested that MDC1 focus formation peaked within 30 min after irradiation and then gradually decreased, while BRCA1 focus accumulated over several hours after IR exposure (43Peng A. Chen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8873-8876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that MDC1 physically associates with USP28, a ubiquitin protease, and decreased MDC1 protein was observed after depletion of USP28, suggesting that MDC1 degradation may depend on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (44Zhang D. Zaugg K. Mak T.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, whether MDC1 is ubiquitylated and how this modification regulates the DNA damage response including BRCA1 recruitment is not known. Here, we hypothesized that ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation controls the disassembly of MDC1 foci in response to DSBs. We show that MDC1 is an ubiquitylated protein that is up-regulated in response to DSBs. Disruption of MDC1 degradation by treatment with proteasome inhibitors (PIs) results in MDC1 accumulation at DSB sites, which is associated with a failure of BRCA1 recruitment through an RNF8-independent mechanism. This work provides new insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of DNA damage response foci, which not only involves recruitment and retention of foci but also focus disassembly via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Cell Lines, Plasmids, siRNA, and Transfections—MCF-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained as recommended. MDC1, RNF8, and control siRNA sequences have been described previously (40Zhang J. Ma Z. Treszezamsky A. Powell S.N. Nat. Struct. Mol.

All transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The H6-Myc-ub and mutant K48 expression vectors were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (46Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). DNA plasmid transfections were performed using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). The adenoviral I-SceI endonuclease Ad-SceI-NG expression vector was obtained from Kristoffer Valerie (47Golding S.E. Rosenberg E. Neill S. Dent P. Povirk L.F. Valerie K. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Proteasome Inhibition Studies—PIs MG132 (carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal) and epoxomicin were dissolved in DMSO and applied to cells at a final concentration of 10 μm for MG132 and 5 μm for Epoxomicin. An equivalent volume of DMSO was added to control cells. PIs were added to the medium, and cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting, or immunoprecipitation at the indicated time points. Alternatively, PIs were added to the cells 1 h prior to exposure of cells to IR. Immunofluorescence Analysis—For visualization of MDC1 protein expression, cells were grown in multiple well chamber slides, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% formaldehyde (BM-155, Boston Bioproducts Inc.), and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were then blocked using 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS and incubated with anti-MDC1 antibody at a corresponding dilution. For analysis of focus formation, a detergent extraction method was employed (48Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 CSK buffer and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. The fixed cells were then permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, followed by blocking and incubation with primary antibodies at a corresponding dilution. Bound antibodies were revealed by goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 594 (red channel) and chicken anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (green channel). The DNA was stained using DAPI at 50 ng/ml. Slides were viewed at ×1000 magnification on an Olympus fluorescence microscope (BX40 with Magna-Fire CCD camera). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For the exogenous Myc-tagged ubiquitin analysis, cells was transfected with H6-M-ub or control vector and 48 h later exposed to PIs. Cell extracts were prepared by resuspending the cells in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (RIPA buffer with EDTA (BP-115D) purchased from Boston Bioproducts Inc.). Ten micrograms of an MDC1 antibody AHP799 (Secrotec) were added to denatured 500–1,000 μg of protein extract and rotated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected with 60-μl slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences AB). The complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer, fractionated by 5% SDS-PAGE overnight at 20 V, transferred to membranes by a semidry transfer method, and immunoblotted with an antibody against c-Myc (Oncogene). The membranes were incubated with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film for protein detection for 2–3 h or longer. All membranes used for anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting were autoclaved submerged in deionized water for 20 min to ensure complete denaturation of the bound ubiquitylated proteins (49Mimnaugh E.G. Chen H.Y. Davie J.R. Celis J.E. Neckers L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14418-14429Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To analyze ubiquitylated MDC1 bound to chromatin, the exogenous Myc-tagged ubiquitin was transfected as described above, and 48 h later cells were treated with PIs. Chromatin-bound proteins were isolated after 4 h using established protocols with minor modifications (38Xu X. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8795-8803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 40Zhang J. Ma Z. Treszezamsky A. Powell S.N. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Briefly, insoluble chromatin was collected by two rounds of centrifugation (4 min each at 1,700 × g and 4 °C). The final chromatin pellet was resuspended in Laemmli buffer and sonicated for 30 s at 25% amplitude. The fractioned chromatin-bound protein was denatured by boiling the sample for 5–10 min, and analyzed by immunoprecipitation using anti-MDC1 antibody and probed with mixed anti-c-Myc antibody and anti-MDC1 antibody or anti-MDC1 antibody alone. To measure MDC1 protein levels, PI-treated MCF-7 cells were harvested at indicated time points. Immunoblotting was performed by using 5% SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were developed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-MDC1 antibody (Novus). Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of the Chromosomal DSB Repair Substrate—The pDR-GFP plasmid (51Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), which contains the 18-bp recognition site for the I-SceI endonuclease within the green fluorescence reporter (GFP), was chromosomally integrated into H1299 cells. Cells were transfected with 1–3 μg of linearized pDR-GFP using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and stable integrants were selected with 1.0 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Several H1299/DR-GFP subclones were established and infected with the I-SceI expression vector Ad-SceI-NG (47Golding S.E. Rosenberg E. Neill S. Dent P. Povirk L.F. Valerie K. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were trypsinized to a single cell suspension and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Two-color fluorescence analysis revealed the percentage of green fluorescent cells relative to the total cell number. For each analysis, 50,000 cells were processed. Subclones that exhibited I-SceI-inducible green fluorescence as a marker of HR were identified (51Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP protocol was previously published and applied here with minor modifications (52Rodrigue A. Lafrance M. Gauthier M.C. McDonald D. Hendzel M. West S.C. Jasin M. Masson J.Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 53Mukhopadhyay A. Deplancke B. Walhout A.J. Tissenbaum H.A. Nat. Prot. 2008; 3: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). H1299/DR-GFP cells were either pretreated with PIs for 2 h or remained untreated. Following infection with the I-SceI expression construct, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Formaldehyde cross-linking and ChIP assays of cultured H1299/DR-GFP cells were performed with the CHIP-IT™ Express kit (Active Motif) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min to cross-link proteins to DNA. Glycine was added to quench the reaction. Cells were collected in scraping solution. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min. Nuclei pellets were collected, resuspended in shearing buffer, and sonicated to obtain DNA fragments using a Bioruptor™ from Diagenode. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight with polyclonal antibodies against MDC1 (Bethyl, rabbit anti-MDC1 A300–053A). Rabbit anti-human IgG (H+L) antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) was used as a negative control. The crosslinks were reversed by adding reverse crosslinking buffer followed by incubation at 94 °C for 15 min. Samples were deproteinized for 1 h with proteinase K, and DNA was extracted with Gel/PCR DNA fragment extraction kit (IBI Scientific). Quantification of the amount of immunoprecipitated DNA was carried out by real-time PCR using the iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), which contained Fast Start TaqDNA polymerase and SYBR Green Dye. For each PCR assay, 1-μl aliquots of the DNA sample were amplified in duplicate. Values were calculated as fold-enrichment compared with the IgG control versus a control locus distinct from the DSB site (52Rodrigue A. Lafrance M. Gauthier M.C. McDonald D. Hendzel M. West S.C.

Prot. 2008; 3: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The antibody to the Myc tag, clone 4A6, was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, USA) and used at 1:500 dilution. The monoclonal IgG antibody FK-2, which recognizes conjugated but not free ubiquitin, was used throughout the study, and referred to as anti-conjugated ubiquitin antibody (used at 1:10,000). Sheep anti-human MDC1 (AHP799) was obtained from Serotec Inc and used at 1:250 dilution for immunoprecipitation. Rabbit anti-human MDC1 antibody (NB 100–395A) was obtained from Novus and was used at 1:100 dilution for immunostaining. Rabbit anti-human MDC1 antibody (A300–051A) was obtained from Bethyl and was used at 1:1,000 dilution for immunoblotting. Rabbit anti-human RNF8 antibody (Abcam) was used at 1:200 dilution for both immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining. Mouse anti-BRCA1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, D-9) was used at 1:200 dilution for immunofluorescence staining. Mouse anti-BRCA1 (Oncogene, Ab-1) was used at a concentration of 1:50 for immunoblotting. Mouse anti-phospho-H2AX (Upstate, 05–636) was used at 1:500 dilution for immunostaining. Sheep IgG (15131) was purchased from Sigma and was used at a 1:500 dilution. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP-conjugated and goat anti-rabbit IG-HRP-conjugated both at 1:5,000 dilution. Other secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 594 and chicken anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probe), were used at a concentration of 1:300 and 1:500, respectively. MDC1 Is Ubiquitylated and Degraded by the Ubiquitin-Proteasome—It has been reported that MDC1 focus formation peaks early after induction of DNA damage and then dramatically declines (43Peng A. Chen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8873-8876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study showed that MDC1 degradation is dependent on the proteasome system (44Zhang D. Zaugg K. Mak T.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2006; 126: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We, therefore, sought to elucidate whether ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of MDC1 may occur at sites of DSBs where it would impact the assembly of other DNA damage response proteins. We first investigated whether MDC1 is post-translationally modified by ubiquitin. Exponentially growing MCF-7 cells were transfected with a Myc-tagged ubiquitin expression vector, H6-Myc-ub, or an empty control vector, which was followed by proteasome inhibition 36–48 h later (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1A shows that higher molecular weight bands were detected in anti-MDC1 immunoprecipitates from cells containing H6-Myc-ub but not in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with the control vector (lanes 1 versus 2). This suggests that MDC1 is post-translationally modified by ubiquitylation. Lysine 48 (K48) of ubiquitin is the most common lysine used for targeting proteins for proteasome dependent degradation. Therefore, we analyzed if a K48 mutant of ubiquitin affects MDC1 ubiquitylation. Wild-type ubiquitin, a mutant in which the lysine 48 residue had been substituted to arginine (K48R) were transfected into MCF-7 cells, and cells lysates were analyzed for ubiquitylation of MDC1. We found that overexpression of the K48R ubiquitin mutant resulted in a reduction of ubiquitylated MDC1 (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and 1), consistent with an interference with the formation of a K48-dependent ubiquitin chain on MDC1. To determine if ubiquitylated MDC1 is targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation, we examined the effect of PIs on MDC1 protein levels.

https://openalex.org/W2072324655,"All previous experimental and theoretical studies of molecular interactions at metal surfaces show that electronically nonadiabatic influences increase with molecular velocity. We report the observation of a nonadiabatic electronic effect that follows the opposite trend: The probability of electron emission from a low–work function surface—Au(111) capped by half a monolayer of Cs—increases as the velocity of the incident NO molecule decreases during collisions with highly vibrationally excited NO(X 2 π ½ , V = 18; V is the vibrational quantum number of NO), reaching 0.1 at the lowest velocity studied. We show that these results are consistent with a vibrational autodetachment mechanism, whereby electron emission is possible only beyond a certain critical distance from the surface. This outcome implies that important energy-dissipation pathways involving nonadiabatic electronic excitations and, furthermore, not captured by present theoretical methods may influence reaction rates at surfaces."

As well as contributing DNA, the egg and sperm mark genes for expression or silencing via a process called imprinting. If conflict between maternally and paternally imprinted genes does prove to cause mental disorders, some aspects of diagnosis would be made simpler.

https://openalex.org/W2068222434,"We demonstrate that a recent dike intrusion probably triggered a slow fault-slip event (SSE) on Kilauea volcano's mobile south flank. Our analysis combined models of Advanced Land Observing Satellite interferometric dike-intrusion displacement maps with continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) displacement vectors to show that deformation nearly identical to four previous SSEs at Kilauea occurred at far-field sites shortly after the intrusion. We model stress changes because of both secular deformation and the intrusion and find that both would increase the Coulomb failure stress on possible SSE slip surfaces by roughly the same amount. These results, in concert with the observation that none of the previous SSEs at Kilauea was directly preceded by intrusions but rather occurred during times of normal background deformation, suggest that both extrinsic (intrusion-triggering) and intrinsic (secular fault creep) fault processes can lead to SSEs."
https://openalex.org/W2030710888,"Binuclear metallophosphoesterases are an enzyme superfamily defined by a shared fold and a conserved active site. Although many family members have been characterized biochemically or structurally, the physiological substrates are rarely known, and the features that determine monoesterase versus diesterase activity are obscure. In the case of the dual phosphomonoesterase/diesterase enzyme CthPnkp, a phosphate-binding histidine was implicated as a determinant of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity. Here we tested this model by comparing the catalytic repertoires of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv0805, which has this histidine in its active site (His(98)), and Escherichia coli YfcE, which has a cysteine at the equivalent position (Cys(74)). We find that Rv0805 has a previously unappreciated 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase function. Indeed, Rv0805 was 150-fold more active in hydrolyzing 2',3'-cAMP than 3',5'-cAMP. Changing His(98) to alanine or asparagine suppressed the 2',3'-cAMP phosphodiesterase activity of Rv0805 without adversely affecting hydrolysis of bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Further evidence for a defining role of the histidine derives from our ability to convert the inactive YfcE protein to a vigorous and specific 2',3'-cNMP phosphodiesterase by introducing histidine in lieu of Cys(74). YfcE-C74H cleaved the P-O2' bond of 2',3'-cAMP to yield 3'-AMP as the sole product. Rv0805, on the other hand, hydrolyzed either P-O2' or P-O3' to yield a mixture of 3'-AMP and 2'-AMP products, with a bias toward 3'-AMP. These reaction outcomes contrast with that of CthPnkp, which cleaves the P-O3' bond of 2',3'-cAMP to generate 2'-AMP exclusively. It appears that enzymic features other than the phosphate-binding histidine can influence the orientation of the cyclic nucleotide and thereby dictate the choice of the leaving group."
https://openalex.org/W1988770890,"Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), a phosphorylated protein present in the mineral phase of both vertebrates and invertebrates, is a key regulatory protein during biogenic formation of mineral deposits. Previously we showed that DMP1 is localized in the nuclear compartment of preosteoblasts and preodontoblasts. In the nucleus DMP1 might play an important role in the regulation of genes that control osteoblast or odontoblast differentiation. Here, we show that cellular uptake of DMP1 occurs through endocytosis. Interestingly, this process is initiated by DMP1 binding to the glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP-78) localized on the plasma membrane of preodontoblast cells. Binding of DMP1 to GRP-78 receptor was determined to be specific and saturable with a binding dissociation constant KD = 85 nm. We further depict a road map for the endocytosed DMP1 and demonstrate that the internalization is mediated primarily by caveolae and that the vesicles containing DMP1 are routed to the nucleus along microtubules. Immunohistochemical analysis and binding studies performed with biotin-labeled DMP1 confirm spatial co-localization of DMP1 and GRP-78 in the preodontoblasts of a developing mouse molar. Co-localization of DMP1 with GRP-78 was also observed in T4-4 preodontoblast cells, dental pulp stem cells, and primary preodontoblasts. By small interfering RNA techniques, we demonstrate that the receptor for DMP1 is GRP-78.

Although initially isolated from the dentin matrix and thought to be unique to dentin and named accordingly, DMP1 has now been found to be present in all mineralized tissues of the vertebrate system (1Narayanan K.

In the nucleus DMP1 played a regulatory role in the regulation of specific genes that control osteoblast and odontoblast differentiation (2Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M.

Specifically, we showed that DMP1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of the odontoblast specific gene dentin sialophosphoprotein (3Narayanan K. Gajjeraman S. Ramachandran A. Hao J. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19064-19071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The export of DMP1 from the nucleus during maturation of osteoblasts was found to be in response to a stimulus from calcium ions. In the extracellular matrix DMP1 can nucleate the formation and growth of hydroxyapatite (4He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 5He G. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11649-11656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Initial observations from the DMP1-deficient mouse showed no apparent skeletal or tooth phenotype during early development, suggesting that DMP1 function may be redundant. However, postnatal DMP1-null mice developed tooth formation defects, characterized by a partial failure of maturation from predentin to dentin (6Ye L. MacDougall M. Zhang S. Xie Y. Zhang J. Li Z. Lu Y. Mishina Y. Feng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19141-19148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that DMP1 may play a pivotal role in regulating mineralized matrix formation. In the present study we demonstrate the mechanism by which DMP1 is endocytosed and translocated to the nucleus of preodontoblasts and dental pulp stem cells (DPSC).Endocytosis is a complex and diverse process and is usually classified into two distinct pathways, namely clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent pathways. The clathrin-mediated pathway targets its cargo to early endosomes and is an important pathway for down-regulation of receptors (7Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The clathrin-independent endocytosis is further divided into dynamin-dependent and dynamin-independent pathways. However, the more characterized of the clathrin-independent pathways is the lipid-raft and the caveolar pathway. Lipid rafts and caveolae are involved in the internalization and trafficking of cholesterol, numerous receptors and signaling molecules and also toxins and viruses (8Anderson R.G. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 9Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat.

Caveolae are 50–80-nm plasma membrane invaginations that contain caveolin-1 as their major constituent. Therefore, caveolin-1 serves as a marker for caveolae-mediated endocytosis.In this study we show that internalization of DMP1 is a caveolae-associated, receptor-mediated event. Three major steps highlighted in this study are as follows; GRP-78 functions as a cell surface receptor in DMP1 endocytosis, caveolae mediate the intracellular transport of DMP1, and DMP1-containing vesicles are transported intracellularly to the Golgi and the nucleus via the microtubules.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Three different cell types were used in this study, namely, the rat T4-4 preodontoblast cell line (11Hao K. Narayanan A. Ramachandran G. He A. Almushayt Evans C. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19976-19981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the human DPSC (12Gronthos S.

The T4-4 cell line has been previously characterized by our laboratory and exhibits odontogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. The DPSC are a gift from Dr. Songtao Shi (University of Southern California) and were isolated from the perivascular niche of human dental pulp (12Gronthos S. Mankani M. Brahim J. Robey P.G. Shi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13625-13630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). Both the cell types were grown in DMEM/F-12 (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro) unless otherwise specified with 1% antibiotic-antimycotics. The primary preodontoblasts were obtained from the developing molar tooth germ and were grown in DMEM/F-12 medium with 20% fetal bovine serum.Expression and Purification of DMP1 and the N (N-DMP1)- and C (C-DMP1)-terminal Fragments of DMP1—The recombinant DMP1 protein without any post-translational modifications was expressed and purified as published earlier (14Srinivasan R. Chen B. Gorski J.P. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The N (amino acids 1–334)- and C (amino acids 335–489)-terminal fragments of DMP1 were amplified from the full-length DMP1 cDNA, cloned into pGEX-4T-3 (Invitrogen), and expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in BL21-DE3 cells. The fusion proteins were then purified by binding to a glutathione-Sepharose column, cleaved using thrombin to remove the fusion tag, and eluted through a benzamidine column to remove thrombin and obtain the respective purified fragments. The recombinant full-length form of DMP1, the N-terminal fragment (N-DMP1), and the C-terminal fragment (C-DMP1) were fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) according to published protocols (3Narayanan K. Gajjeraman S. Ramachandran A. Hao J. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19064-19071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Binding of DMP1 to T4-4 Cells—Recombinant DMP1 was biotinylated using the Sulfo-NHS biotinylation kit (Pierce) as per the manufacturer's instructions. T4-4 cells were plated onto 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well and allowed to attach for about 16–20 h. These experiments were performed at 4 °C, which did not permit endocytosis. Before the start of the binding assay, the plate was cooled to 4 °C for 30 min, and then the cells were washed 3× with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen) and once with ice cold growth medium (DMEM/F-12) without serum. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in serum-free DMEM/F12 containing increasing concentrations of biotinylated DMP1 (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5 μg/100 μl). After binding, the cells were gently rinsed 3× with ice-cold PBS and incubated with streptavidin-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (0.1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. After rinsing the cells 3× in ice-cold PBS, 100 μl of an HRP substrate (1-step Turbo TMB-ELISA from Pierce) was added to the wells and incubated for 20 min. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of 1 m sulfuric acid, and the plate was read at 450 nm in a Bio-Tek microtiter plate reader. The absorbance reading after subtraction of background (biotinylated DMP1 in the absence of cells) was then used to determine the amount of DMP1 bound to the cell surface. A standard curve was constructed from known concentrations of DMP1 bound to the cell surface. Results were analyzed using the Sigma Plot software to derive binding curves.Endocytosis of DMP1—Endocytosis of DMP1 was analyzed by two approaches. In the first method T4-4 cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well in 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates. Cells were incubated with biotinylated DMP1 at varying concentrations as mentioned previously in serum-free DMEM/F-12 and incubated at 37 °C for a period of 30 min. They were then washed extensively in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and incubated with streptavidin-HRP conjugate (0.1 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed extensively with PBS and then incubated with HRP substrate. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a BioTek microtiter plate reader. The concentration of DMP1 endocytosed at saturation was estimated from the standard curve.In the second method T4-4 cells, DPSC, or primary odontoblasts were grown on coverslips placed in 6-well tissue culture dishes in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum for at least 24 h. Before the start of the experiment the cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with 10 μg/ml FITC-labeled DMP1 at 37 °C for 30 min. Protocol for FITC labeling was as published earlier (3Narayanan K. Gajjeraman S. Ramachandran A. Hao J. George A. J. Biol.

For the time course experiments, T4-4 cells were incubated with FITC-DMP1 for 60 min at 4 °C before incubation for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C. The cells were washed extensively, fixed, permeabilized, and mounted on glass slides using mounting media with or without DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence in the cells was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Fluorescence quantification was performed for experiments involving 30- and 60-min incubations with T4-4 cells to obtain nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of the endocytosed FITC-DMP1. Briefly, the mean fluorescence from an outlined area (nuclear or cytoplasmic) of the confocal images was multiplied with the area under consideration. This yielded the total fluorescence from the two regions. These data were used to estimate the percentage of nuclear and cytoplasmic pools of DMP1. Uptake experiments were also performed with FITC-N-DMP1 and FITC-C-DMP1 at the 45-min time point. FITC-bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a negative control.Endocytosis experiments were also performed in the presence of various endocytic inhibitors. T4-4 cells were pretreated with the specified concentrations of the inhibitors for 60 min at 37 °C before treatment with FITC-DMP1. The different inhibitors used were hyperosmotic sucrose (0.45 m) (15Inal J. Miot S. Schifferli J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 310: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), Ikg (2 μm) (16Luo T. Fredericksen B.L. Hasumi K. Endo A. Garcia J.V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), methyl-β-cyclodextrin (1%) (17Schousboe I. Thomsen P. van Deurs B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2998-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and colchicine (20 μm) (18Baron D.A. Burch R.M. Halushka P.V. Spicer S.S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1985; 249: 464-469Crossref Google Scholar) according to published concentrations. Endocytosis was also performed after pretreatments either with anti-rabbit GRP-78 antibody (1:100), 2 mm RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide, or CD44 antibody (1/100).Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—For immunostaining, T4-4 cells were treated with various reagents as mentioned above, fixed, permeabilized, blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with the indicated concentration of the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing extensively with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody. All secondary antibody incubations were performed in the dark to minimize loss of fluorescent signal due to photo bleaching. The cells were then washed extensively in PBS and mounted on glass slides. The antibodies used were anti-α-tubulin (1:5000) (Sigma), anti-caveolin1 (1:75) (Santa Cruz), anti-clathrin (1:50) (Santa Cruz), and anti-GRP-78 serum (1:100). Golgi staining was performed after permeabilization by incubating the cells with R-WGA (rhodamine-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin, 10 μg/ml) (Vector Laboratories) in PBS for 60 min at room temperature in the dark. Actin was stained after permeabilization by incubating the cells with phalloidin-TRITC (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at room temperature.For confocal microscopy the images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 or 510 META confocal microscope equipped with a 63× water immersion objective. 100× oil immersion objective was only used for FITC-DMP1 and GRP-78 z-stack images. All the confocal images are representatives of experiments conducted in triplicates. The imaging parameters were maintained constant whenever intensity of fluorescence was to be compared. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the z-stack images was performed using the Zeiss LSM imaging software.Isolation of DMP1 Plasma Membrane Binding Partner—Recombinant GST-DMP1 was bound to GST-Sepharose beads and used as a bait column. Membrane protein lysate from T4-4 cells were prepared using the MEM-PER membrane protein extraction kit (Pierce) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The bait column was then incubated with the membrane proteins isolated from T4-4 cells at 4 °C overnight. The column was then washed extensively with PBS containing 150 mm NaCl and eluted using PBS containing 1 m NaCl. The eluted proteins were extensively dialyzed against 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, lyophilized, and dissolved in 100 μl of PBS. 40 μl of the protein sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Additionally, a T-75 flask of T4-4 cells was treated with recombinant GST-DMP1 (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C to ensure binding but not endocytosis. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times after which the membrane proteins were isolated as described previously. The isolated membrane proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed extensively in PBS containing 150 mm NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted with glutathione, extensively dialyzed in 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, lyophilized, and redissolved in 50 μl of PBS. The entire sample was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Finally, immunoblotting was performed with anti-GRP-78.Protein Sequencing Using Mass Spectrometry—SDS-PAGE analysis identified 4 protein bands at ∼72, 37, 33, and 30 kDa. Each of these bands were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel proteolytic digestion with trypsin. The recovered peptides were separated and analyzed using an LTQ mass spectrometer to obtain MS/MS spectra at the Proteomics facility at University of Illinois at Chicago. The sequences of the peptides were inferred by matching the MS/MS spectra to protein sequence data base using Sequest and Mascot data base search engines.GRP-78 shRNA Knockdown—Two target sequences of GRP-78 gene were used. One sequence that was effective in silencing GRP-78 was used in this experiment. This sequence targeted rat GRP-78 at the 3′-untranslated region. T4-4 cells were plated onto 6-well tissue culture plates at 80% confluence and allowed to attach for 24 h. They were then transiently transfected with the GRP-78 shRNA plasmid pLKO.1 (Sigma) containing the sequence CCGGCTCGAATGTAATTGGAATCTTCTCGAGAAGATTCCAATTACATTCGAGTTTTT using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml FITC-DMP1 for 10 min. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with GRP-78 antibody as described previously. The cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axio Observer-D1 fluorescence microscope equipped with the appropriate filter sets to view green and red fluorescence and Axiovision imaging software.GRP-78 and DMP1 Immunohistochemistry—5-Day post-natal mice heads were sectioned along the midline and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at a thickness of 5 μm, with each slide containing 2 sections. The sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated through graded ethanol. They were then incubated in 3% H2O2 for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity and blocked with serum in PBS (Vecta stain ABC peroxidase kit) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either PBS containing 30 μg/ml of biotinylated DMP1, FITC-DMP1, anti-DMP1 antibody (1/200), or anti-GRP-78 antibody (1/100) in PBS containing 3% BSA. Slides were then washed 4× in PBS (15 min each wash). Sections that were incubated with biotinylated DMP1 were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Vectorstain ABC peroxidase kit) and developed with the DAB kit (Vector Laboratories). Sections incubated with FITC-DMP1 were mounted with fluorescence mounting solution (Vector Laboratories) and imaged using a Zeiss Axio Observer-D1 fluorescence microscope equipped with the appropriate filter sets to view green fluorescence and Axiovision imaging software. The sections that were incubated with the primary antibodies were incubated with their biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed 4× in PBS, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Vecta stain ABC peroxidase kit), and developed with the DAB kit (Vector Laboratories).Preparation of Detergent-resistant Membrane Fractions—T4-4 cells were incubated briefly with recombinant DMP1. The cells were then lysed, and the detergent-resistant membrane fractions were prepared as described by Macdonald et al. (19Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). 50 μl of each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed with anti-caveolin-1 and anti-DMP1 antibodies.Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA. The membrane was then incubated overnight with rabbit anti-GRP-78 antibody (1:1000), anti-caveolin-1 antibody (1/750), or anti-DMP1 antibody (1/500) at 4 °C. The membrane was then washed 3× for 15 min with PBS-Tween at room temperature and then incubated with anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for GRP-78 blots and with anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody for DMP1 and caveolin-1 blots. The membrane was then washed 3× with PBS-Tween and then developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) for HRP or with an Bio-Rad alkaline phosphatase developer kit.RESULTSBinding of Biotinylated DMP1 to T4-4 Cells—In this experiment we show that there is specific binding of DMP1 to the cell surface. We performed binding experiments using biotinylated DMP1 on T4-4 cells. These experiments were conducted at 4 °C, which did not permit internalization. Fig. 1a shows the inverse Langmuir isotherm plot (rectangular hyperbola) fit to the data from the binding experiment, and Fig. 1b shows the corresponding Scatchard plot. These results demonstrate that the binding was saturable, and the dissociation constant was estimated to be 85 nm, indicating a tight binding of DMP1 to the cell surface with 9 × 106 molecules of biotinylated DMP1 bound per cell (estimated using Avogadro constant).Endocytosis of DMP1—To demonstrate the cellular uptake of DMP1, biotinylated DMP1 was added exogenously in increasing concentrations to T4-4 preodontoblast cells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Quantification of biotin uptake indicated that DMP1 was internalized in a concentration-dependent manner; Fig. 1c. We estimated that at saturation 16.1 nm was endocytosed by 20,000 T4-4 cells. To further validate the internalization process, T4-4 cells, DPSC, and primary odontoblasts were treated for 30 min with FITC-DMP1. Analysis by confocal microscopy showed that DMP1 was endocytosed and transported to the perinuclear region (Fig. 1, e, f, and g). However, FITC labeled BSA, which served as the control was not internalized (Fig. 1d).Fig. 1h shows the time course of FITC-DMP1 uptake in T4-4 cells. The intracellular transport of DMP1 was seen in vesicles and localized around the perinuclear region by 15 min and localized in the nucleus by 30 min.Additionally, endocytosis was also performed after pretreatment of both DPSC and T4-4 cells with 2 mm RGD polypeptide to block the integrins and also with anti-CD44 (1/100) antibody (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 37 °Cas αvβ3 integrin, αvβ5 integrin, and CD44 have been previously suggested to be putative DMP1 cell surface binding partners. The endocytosis of FITC-DMP1 was unaffected by these treatments (see supplemental Fig. 1).Identification of GRP-78 as a Cell Surface Receptor—The results mentioned above indicate that DMP1 might be endocytosed through a receptor-mediated mechanism. To identify a receptor, the total membrane protein lysate from T4-4 cells was incubated with a GST-DMP1 bait column. Eluates from the column were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. Fig. 2a shows four bands at ∼75, 40, 33, and 30 kDa. Each of these bands was subjected to trypsin digestion and MS/MS analysis. The 33- and 30-kDa bands were identified as tropomyosin fragments. The 40-kDa band was identified as actin, and the 75-kDa band was identified as GRP-78. Among these proteins, GRP-78 seemed a likely candidate for being a possible DMP1 binding partner. Although GRP-78 is one of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins, it is also present at the cell surface of many cell types (20Delpino A. Castelli M. Biosci.

Immunoblot analysis performed with anti-GRP-78 antibody on the eluate from GST-DMP1 bait column confirmed the membrane protein to be GRP-78 (Fig. 2c). Tropomyosin and actin that were also identified have been reported to be co-localized on the plasma membrane of osteoclasts (240). To further confirm that DMP1 binds specifically to GRP-78, the membrane fraction of T4-4 cells incubated with GST-DMP1 at 4 °C and subsequently purified on a GST column was subjected to immunoblotting with GRP-78 antibody. Results confirmed that DMP1 bound specifically to GRP-78 localized on the plasma membrane of T4-4 cells (Fig. 2d). Together, these observations indicate that GRP-78 is the cell surface DMP1-binding protein.FIGURE 2Identification of a receptor mediating DMP1 endocytosis. a, eluate from T4-4 membrane protein lysate was passed through a glutathione column bound with GST-DMP1 fusion protein. Four polypeptides of Mr = 75, 50, 37, and 25 were obtained and sequenced. b, peptides identified with greater than 95% accuracy by Mascot (italics), Sequest (normal), or both (bold) search engines fed with the raw MS/MS data from the mass spectrometer present in the boxed protein band from a subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion identifying the DMP1-binding protein to be GRP-78. c, immunoblot of the eluate from the GST-DMP1 bait column with anti GRP-78 antibody, thus confirming the DMP1-binding protein to be GRP-78. d, immunoblot of membrane proteins isolated from T4-4 cells incubated with GST-DMP1 passed through a GST column with GRP-78 antibody to confirm GRP-78 as a DMP1-binding protein. e, confocal images of T4-4 cells treated with anti GRP-78 antibody showing cytoplasmic as well as plasma membrane localization of GRP-78 (white arrows point to membranous staining).

https://openalex.org/W2002437805,"Partial degradation or regulated ubiquitin proteasome-dependent processing by the 26 S proteasome has been demonstrated, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and the prevalence of this phenomenon remain obscure. Here we show that the Gly-Ala repeat (GAr) sequence of EBNA1 affects processing of substrates via the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway in a substrate- and position-specific fashion. GAr-mediated increase in stability of proteins targeted for degradation via the 26 S proteasome was associated with a fraction of the substrates being partially processed and the release of the free GAr. The GAr did not cause a problem for the proteolytic activity of the proteasome, and its fusion to the N terminus of p53 resulted in an increase in the rate of degradation of the entire chimera. Interestingly the GAr had little effect on the stability of EBNA1 protein itself, and targeting EBNA1 for 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation led to its complete degradation. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which the GAr prevents degradation or promotes endoproteolytic processing of substrates targeted for the 26 S proteasome by interfering with the initiation step of substrate unfolding. These results will help to further understand the underlying mechanisms for partial proteasome-dependent degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1982253396,"We previously reported that the heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase (3OST)-5 produces a novel component of heparan sulfate, i.e. the tetrasulfated disaccharide (Di-tetraS) unit ( Mochizuki, H., Yoshida, K., Gotoh, M., Sugioka, S., Kikuchi, N., Kwon, Y.-D., Tawada, A., Maeyama, K., Inaba, N., Hiruma, T., Kimata, K., and Narimatsu, H. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 26780-26787 ). In the present study, we investigated the potential of other 3OST isoforms to produce Di-tetraS with heparan sulfate and heparin as acceptor substrates. 3OST-2, 3OST-3, and 3OST-4 produce Di-tetraS units as a major product from both substrates. 3OST-5 showed the same specificity for heparin, but the production from heparan sulfate was very low. Di-tetraS production by 3OST-1 was negligible. We then investigated the presence of Di-tetraS units in heparan sulfates from various rat tissues. Di-tetraS was detected in all of the tissues analyzed. Liver and spleen contain relatively high levels of Di-tetraS, 1.6 and 0.95%, respectively. However, the content of this unit in heart, large intestine, ileum, and lung is low, less than 0.2%. We further determined the expression levels of 3OST transcripts by quantitative real time PCR. The 3OST-3 transcripts are highly expressed in spleen and liver. The 3OST-2 and -4 are specifically expressed in brain. These results indicate that the Di-tetraS unit is widely distributed throughout the body as a rare and unique component of heparan sulfate and is synthesized by tissue-specific 3OST isoforms specific for Di-tetraS production."
https://openalex.org/W2123111478,"The existence of anti-inflammatory circuits centered on melanocortin receptors (MCRs) has been supported by the inhibitory properties displayed by melanocortin peptides in models of inflammation and tissue injury. Here we addressed the pathophysiological effect that one MCR, MCR type 3 (MC3R), might have on vascular inflammation. After occlusion (35 min) and reopening of the superior mesenteric artery, MC3R-null mice displayed a higher degree of plasma extravasation (45 min postreperfusion) and cell adhesion and emigration (90 min postreperfusion). These cellular alterations were complemented by higher expression of mesenteric tissue CCL2 and CXCL1 (mRNA and protein) and myeloperoxydase, as compared with wild-type animals. MC1R and MC3R mRNA and protein were both expressed in the inflamed mesenteric tissue; however, no changes in vascular responses were observed in a mouse colony bearing an inactive MC1R. Pharmacological treatment of animals with a selective MC3R agonist ([D-Trp(8)]-gamma-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; 10 microg i.v.) produced marked attenuation of cell adhesion, emigration, and chemokine generation; such effects were absent in MC3R-null mice. These new data reveal the existence of a tonic inhibitory signal provided by MC3R in the mesenteric microcirculation of the mouse, acting to down-regulate cell trafficking and local mediator generation."
https://openalex.org/W2122987432,"Escherichia coli thioredoxin binds to a unique flexible loop of 71 amino acid residues, designated the thioredoxin binding domain (TBD), located in the thumb subdomain of bacteriophage T7 gene 5 DNA polymerase. The initial designation of thioredoxin as a processivity factor was premature. Rather it remodels the TBD for interaction with DNA and the other replication proteins. The binding of thioredoxin exposes a number of basic residues on the TBD that lie over the duplex region of the primer-template and increases the processivity of nucleotide polymerization. Two small solvent-exposed loops (loops A and B) located within TBD electrostatically interact with the acidic C-terminal tail of T7 gene 4 helicase-primase, an interaction that is enhanced by the binding of thioredoxin. Several basic residues on the surface of thioredoxin in the polymerase-thioredoxin complex lie in close proximity to the TBD. One of these residues, lysine 36, is located proximal to loop A. The substitution of glutamate for lysine has a dramatic effect on the binding of gene 4 helicase to a DNA polymerase-thioredoxin complex lacking charges on loop B; binding is decreased 15-fold relative to that observed with wild-type thioredoxin. This defective interaction impairs the ability of T7 DNA polymerase-thioredoxin together with T7 helicase to mediate strand displacement synthesis. This is the first demonstration that thioredoxin interacts with replication proteins other than T7 DNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1976825919,"Nonclassical secondary cell wall polysaccharides constitute a major cell wall structure in the Bacillus cereus group of bacteria. The structure of the secondary cell wall polysaccharide from Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987, a strain that is closely related to Bacillus anthracis, was determined. This polysaccharide was released from the cell wall with aqueous hydrogen fluoride (HF) and purified by gel filtration chromatography. The purified polysaccharide, HF-PS, was characterized by glycosyl composition and linkage analyses, mass spectrometry, and one- and two-dimensional NMR analysis. The results showed that the B. cereus ATCC 10987 HF-PS has a repeating oligosaccharide consisting of a →6)-α-GalNAc-(1→4)-β-ManNAc-(1→4)-β-GlcNAc-(1→ trisaccharide that is substituted with β-Gal at O3 of the α-GalNAc residue and nonstoichiometrically acetylated at O3 of the N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) residue. Comparison of this structure with that of the B. anthracis HF-PS and with structural data obtained for the HF-PS from B. cereus type strain ATCC 14579 revealed that each HF-PS had the same general structural theme consisting of three HexNAc and one Hex residues. A common structural feature in the HF-PSs from B. cereus ATCC 10987 and B. anthracis was the presence of a repeating unit consisting of a HexNAc3 trisaccharide backbone in which two of the three HexNAc residues are GlcNAc and ManNAc and the third can be either GlcNAc or GalNAc. The implications of these results with regard to the possible functions of the HF-PSs are discussed.

The Bacillus cereus is a group of Gram-positive bacteria that includes Bacillus anthracis, B. cereus, and Bacillus thuringiensis strains. Members of this group are very closely related. In fact, on the basis of detailed phylogenetic analysis, it has been suggested that they all may belong to a single species (1Helgason E. Okstad O.A. Caugant D.A. Johansen H.A. Fouet A. Mock M. Hegna I. Kolsto A.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 2627-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Despite the very close relatedness of B. cereus group members, there is considerable pathogenic variability. Some members of this group are not pathogenic, whereas others are opportunistic pathogens causing a range of conditions on a variety of hosts. Bacillus thuringiensis is an insect pathogen, and B. cereus is normally a soil-dwelling bacterium, which in rare cases, causes, in humans, usually nonfatal cases of food poisoning, sepsis, endophthalmitis, and occasionally severe or fatal pneumonia. One member, B. anthracis, causes anthrax in animals and humans and is considered a high threat bioterrorism agent. This variability in pathogenicity and host range is largely attributed to the plasmid content of the B. cereus group members, which can vary in size and number (2Rasko D.A. Altherr M.R. Han C.S. Ravel J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 303-329PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the crystal toxin genes of B. thuringiensis are carried on a plasmid (3Gonzales J.M.J. Brown B.J. Carlton B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6951-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and plasmids pXO1 and pXO2 contain the genes required for the production of the B. anthracis toxin proteins and γ-polyglutamate capsule, respectively (4Okinaka R.T.

For numerous bacterial pathogens, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, cell wall polysaccharides are known virulence factors.

Interestingly, it was shown that the B. cereus isolates which caused severe or fatal pneumonia and contained the pXO1 plasmid had HF-released polysaccharide (HF-PS) glycosyl compositions that closely resembled that of B. anthracis (10Leoff C.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), indicating that HF-PS structural conservation plays a role in pathogenic function. Further work has shown that antiserum against B. anthracis cross-reacts to some extent with the HF-PS from these B. cereus isolates, indicating that they are structurally related to the B. anthracis HF-PS. 4C. Leoff, E. Saile, J. Rauvolfova, C. P. Quinn, A. R. Hoffmaster, W. Zhong, A. S. Mehta, G. J. Boons, R. W. Carlson, and E. L. Kannenberg, submitted for publication. Future publications will describe the structures of the HF-PSs from these B. cereus isolates. Recent structural determination of B. anthracis HF-PS showed that it was composed of a trisaccharide backbone consisting of two GlcNAc residues and one N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) residue and that this backbone is variably substituted with terminal Gal residues (10Leoff C.

This structure falls into the class of nonclassical secondary cell wall polymers (SCWP) of Gram-positive bacteria, as defined by Schäffer and Messner (13Schäffer C. Messner P. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), that are covalently attached to the peptidoglycan through a phosphate or pyrophosphate bond. The S-layer proteins are anchored to the cell wall by binding to the SCWP polysaccharide via a carbohydrate-binding domain known as the S-layer homology (SLH) domain (14Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Secondary cell wall polysaccharide structures have been determined for a number of Gram-positive bacteria, including some B. cereus strains (13Schäffer C. Messner P. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Older reports described that B. cereus AHU 1356 produced a neutral carbohydrate composed of GlcNAc, ManNAc, GalNAc, and Glc (15Amano K. Hazama S. Araki Y. Ito E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, an acidic carbohydrate composed of GlcNAc, Gal, rhamnose (Rha), glycerol, and phosphate was also identified in this strain (16Kojima N. Araki Y. Ito E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because of the considerable importance of bacilli with regard to public health, a more complete picture of these carbohydrates is needed. Structural determination of the HF-PSs is necessary as the first step into structure-function studies of these SCWP polysaccharides as well as to answer questions about their suitability for developing new and/or improved vaccines and diagnostic agents. In order to determine the relationship of these polysaccharides with pathogenicity, it is necessary to systematically characterize their structures. In this effort, we have initially selected the HF-PS from pathogenic B. anthracis and compared it with the HF-PSs from two normally nonpathogenic strains, the dairy isolate B. cereus ATCC 10987 and the B. cereus type strain ATCC 14579. We selected B. cereus strain ATCC 10987 and the B. cereus type strain ATCC 14579, since the genome of strain B. cereus ATCC 10987 is 93.7%, similar to that of B. anthracis and 90.9% similar to the genome of the B. cereus type strain, ATCC 14579, and since strain ATCC 10987 also contains a plasmid that is similar to the B. anthracis pXO1 virulence plasmid but lacks the pathogenicity island (17Rasko D.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We have already published, in this journal, the structure of the HF-PSs from B. anthracis Ames, Sterne, and Pasteur (12Choudhury B. Leoff C. Saile E. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Kannenberg E.L. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27932-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here, we report the structure of the HF-PS from B. cereus strain ATCC 10987 as well as partial structural data for the HF-PS from the B. cereus type strain ATCC 14579 and compare those structures with that of the HF-PS from B. anthracis. We have included the partial structural data of the HF-PS from B. cereus type strain ATCC 14579, since these data, together with the complete structure of the B. cereus ATCC 10987 described here and that reported for B. anthracis (12Choudhury B.

Chem. 2006; 281: 27932-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), reveal that the HF-PSs from these strains contain unique structural features that are present on a possibly B. cereus-conserved structural scaffold. The implications of these results with regard to possible functions are discussed. Bacterial Strains and Cultural Conditions—B. anthracis Ames, B. cereus ATCC 10987, and B. cereus ATCC 14579 were provided from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention culture collection. Cultures were grown were grown as described in our previous report (12Choudhury B. Leoff C. Saile E. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Kannenberg E.L. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27932-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Preparation of Bacillus Cell Wall Polysaccharides—The bacterial cell walls were prepared using a modified procedure described by Brown (18Brown W.C. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 25: 295-300Google Scholar) as we previously reported (10Leoff C. Saile E. Sue D. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Carlson R.W. Kannenberg E.L. J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 27932-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The polysaccharides were released from the isolated cell walls by treatment with aqueous HF and purified by gel permeation chromatography, as described in our previous report (12Choudhury B. Leoff C. Saile E. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Kannenberg E.L. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27932-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Composition and Glycosyl Linkage Analysis of the Cell Wall Polysaccharides—Glycosyl composition analysis was done by the preparation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of trimethylsilyl methyl glycosides (19York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The trimethylsilyl methyl glycosides were analyzed by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, as previously reported (12Choudhury B. Leoff C. Saile E. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Kannenberg E.L. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27932-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The glycosyl linkage analysis was performed according to a modification of the method of Ciucanu and Kerek (20Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar), as described in our previous report (12Choudhury B. Leoff C. Saile E. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Kannenberg E.L. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27932-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). De-O-acetylation of the Cell Wall Polysaccharides—The HF-PS was deacetylated by mild hydrazinolysis. Approximately, 4 mg of sample was treated with 200 μl of anhydrous hydrazine (Pierce) at 37 °C for 1 h. The sample was cooled on an ice bath, and 2 ml of cold acetone (–70 °C) was added dropwise with mild shaking. The mixture was kept overnight at –4 °C for complete precipitation of de-O-acetylated HF-PS. The de-O-acetylated HF-PS was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 7 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and precipitate was washed with cold acetone (–70 °C), followed by centrifugation. (This step was repeated two more times.) Finally, the precipitate was dried under nitrogen flow, dissolved in water, and lyophilized. NMR Analysis—The HF-PS sample (2–3 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of regular grade deuterium oxide (D2O 98.5%) and lyophilized. This process was done twice to exchange the hydroxyl and amide protons with deuterium. The sample was finally dissolved in 0.5 ml of 100% D2O (Cambridge Isotopes) and transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube. All one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra were acquired with a 600-MHz Varian Inova instrument using the standard software supplied by Varian. 1H-1H homonuclear two-dimensional experiments were done after perfect 90° pulse calibration and 3.5 K spectral width in both dimensions; however, 1H-13C HSQC data were acquired taking 3.5 and 12 K in direct and indirect dimensions, respectively. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectral analysis of the isolated HF-PS was determined using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer from Applied Biosystems. The HF-PS was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of methanol/water and mixed in equal proportion (v/v) with 0.5 m 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix. About 0.7 μl of the mixture was loaded on each spot on a stainless steel MALDI plate and air-dried. The spectra were acquired in either the linear or reflectron-positive modes using a 337-nm N2 laser with acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Isolation and Initial Analysis; Glycosyl Composition and Linkage Analysis—The HF-PS from the investigated B. cereus strains eluted as a single major peak within the void volume of the Bio-Gel P2 column; the peak fractions were collected, lyophilized, and used for detailed structural analysis. The HF-PS composition from B. anthracis Ames consisted of Gal, GlcNAc, and ManNAc in an approximate 3:2:1 ratio, as previously described for four B. anthracis strains (Ames, Pasteur, Sterne 34F2, and UT60) (10Leoff C. Saile E. Sue D. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Carlson R.W. Kannenberg E.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Choudhury B. Leoff C. Saile E. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Kannenberg E.L. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27932-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The composition of the HF-PS from B. cereus ATCC 10987 consisted of Gal, ManNAc, GlcNAc, and GalNAc in a 1.6:1.5:1.0:1.4 ratio (Table 1). A small amount of Glc was present due to contamination of the HF-PS preparation with a Glc-rich polysaccharide, as previously reported (10Leoff C. Saile E. Sue D. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Carlson R.W. Kannenberg E.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The composition of B. cereus ATCC 14579 HF-PS consisted of Glc, ManNAc, GlcNAc, and GalNAc in approximately a 1.8:1.5:3.1:1.0 ratio (Table 1). Thus, the differences in glycosyl compositions of these two B. cereus HF-PSs shows that their structures are not identical to each other and that they also differ from that of the B. anthracis HF-PS, as reported earlier (10Leoff C. Saile E. Sue D. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Carlson R.W. Kannenberg E.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Choudhury B. Leoff C. Saile E. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Kannenberg E.L. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27932-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, these two B. cereus HF-PSs contain GalNAc, which is not present in the B. anthracis HF-PS, and the B. cereus ATCC 14579 HF-PS contains Glc, which is not found in either the B. cereus ATCC 10987 or in the B. anthracis HF-PSs. These results are consistent with our earlier report (12Choudhury B. Leoff C. Saile E. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Kannenberg E.L. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27932-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), in which proton NMR analysis also showed that these HF-PSs have different structures.TABLE 1The glycosyl compositions of the HF-PS preparations from B. cereus strains ATCC 10987 and ATCC 14579StrainSugar compositionManGlcGalManNAcGlcNAcGalNAc%%%%%%B. cereus ATCC 10987ND8.626.725.316.423.0B. cereus ATCC 14579ND25.3ND15.444.914.4 Open table in a new tab Methylation analysis showed that the B. cereus ATCC 10987 HF-PS consisted of terminally linked Gal, 3,6-linked GalNAc, 4-linked ManNAc, and 4-linked GlcNAc. Minor components included terminally linked GlcNAc, ManNAc, and GalNAc, indicating the possibility of molecular microheterogeneity within the HF-PS preparation. The presence of minor amounts of these terminal HexNAc residues is probably due to variously sized HF-PS molecules that differ in their nonreducing terminal glycosyl residues. They are present as minor components, since the HF-PS consists of variously sized molecules of up to 7759 daltons (as shown by MS analysis and described further below) and, therefore, the HexNAc residues at the nonreducing termini of these differently sized molecules found in the HF-PS preparation would be present in small amounts relative to the glycosyl residues in the multiple repeat units. For the B. cereus ATCC 14579 HF-PS, methylation analysis showed terminally linked Glc, terminally linked GlcNAc, 4-linked GlcNAc, 4-linked ManNAc, 6-linked GalNAc, 3,4-linked ManNAc, and 3,4,6-linked GlcNAc. Exact quantification of the partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) in these samples was not possible due to the resistance to acid hydrolysis of the aminoglycosyl glycoside bonds in the permethylated HF-PS. The complexity of the glycosyl linkages in B. cereus ATCC 14579 HF-PS compared with the HF-PSs from B. anthracis and B. cereus ATCC 10987 indicates that it is significantly more heterogeneous and structurally complex. Structural Determination of the B. cereus ATCC 10987 HF-PS—The MALDI-TOF/TOF MS mass spectrum of the B. cereus ATCC 10987 HF-PS is shown in Fig. 1. The results show that this HF-PS preparation consists of a microheterogeneous mixture of molecules of varying sizes. The mass spectrum, obtained in the reflectron mode, shown in Fig. 1A reveals two ion clusters with the most intense ion in each cluster being the [M + Na]+ ions observed at m/z 1583.5 and at m/z 2354.6, respectively. The reflectron mode of analysis emphasizes lower molecular weight forms of the HF-PS; however, there are also higher molecular weight forms of the HF-PS, and these forms could be observed after de-O-acetylation of the HF-PS and MS analysis in the linear mode (shown in Fig. 1B and described further below). The difference between the m/z 2354.6 and 1583.5 ions, 772 mass units, exactly matches the mass of a (HexNAc)3(Hex)1 tetramer. These results suggest that the m/z = 1583.5 ion is due to an octasaccharide composed of two (HexNAc)3(Hex)1 tetrameric repeating units, and that the ion at m/z = 2354.6 corresponds to a molecule with three tetrameric repeat units. Based on glycosyl composition results described above, probable compositions for these masses are given in Table 2. In addition to these major ions for the two ion clusters, several other ions were observed. The ions at m/z 1625.5 and 1667.5 are 42 and 84 mass units greater, respectively, than the m/z 1583.5 ion, indicating that these ions are due to mono- and di-O-acetylation, respectively, of the ditetrasaccharide repeat structure. The O-acetyl groups, when present, are located on the ManNAc residues, as determined by NMR analysis, which is described below. The ions at m/z 1607.5 and m/z 1649.5 are due to minor amounts of dehydrated (–18 mass units) versions of these acetylated molecules. We also observe ions at m/z 1786.5 and 1990.6, which are consistent with one and two additional HexNAc residues, respectively, to the m/z 1583.5 ion. The difference between the m/z 1990.6 ion and the m/z 2354.6 ion is 365 mass units. This difference is consistent with the addition of a HexHexNAc disaccharide to the 1990.6 molecule.TABLE 2Proposed structures for the various molecular ions observed during MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the HF-PS from B. cereus ATCC 10987Repeat unitsProposed structureObserved [M + Na]+ ionR1 + 1[ManNAc-GlcNAc(Gal)GalNAc]-ManNAc1015.3R1 + 2[ManNAc-GlcNAc-(GalGalNAc]-ManNAc-GlcNAc1218.4R2 + 0[ManNAc-GlNAc-(Gal)GalNc]-[ManNAc-GlcNc-(Gal)GalNAc]1583.5R2aThe location of these acetyl (Ac) groups could be on any of one, two, or three of the various ManNAc residues.

Open table in a new tab Mass spectrometric analysis, in the linear mode, of the HF-PS after de-O-acetylation (Fig. 1B) shows that that there is considerable size heterogeneity in the HF-PS preparation. A series of [M + Na]+ ions are observed up to m/z 7759. Each of these ions differs from the previous ion by 772 mass units, which is the mass of the (HexNAc)3(Hex)1 repeat unit. These results show that the HF-PS polysaccharide consists of a mixture of molecules that vary from 2 to at least 10 repeating tetrasaccharide units. It is possible that this size heterogeneity is present in vivo or is produced during the release of the polysaccharide from the cell wall by aqueous HF. De-O-acetylation allows these ions to be observed by removing the considerable microheterogeneity caused by variation in acetylation, microheterogeneity that increases with increasing number of repeat units. The anomeric configuration and the sequence of the glycosyl residues in the B. cereus ATCC 10987 were determined by both one- and two-dimensional NMR analysis of the HF-PS before and after removal of the O-acetyl groups. The complete proton and carbon assignments of this HF-PS were obtained by one-dimensional proton NMR (Fig. 2) and by two-dimensional gCOSY, TOCSY (Fig. 3), and gHSQC (Fig. 4) experiments. The proton spectrum shows four major anomeric H1 signals at δ 5.23, δ 5.04, δ 4.57, and δ 4.45 and a minor anomeric H1 signal at δ 4.92. Each of these anomeric protons is due to a unique glycosyl ring system in this HF-PS, and the gCOSY, TOCSY (Fig. 3), and gHSQC (Fig. 4) experiments allowed the proton and carbon assignments of each of these ring systems as explained below and given in Table 3.FIGURE 3The TOCSY spectrum of the HF-PS from B. cereus ATCC 10987.

https://openalex.org/W2164757843,"In yeast telomerase mutants, the Sgs1 RecQ helicase slows the rate of senescence and also facilitates the appearance of certain types of survivors of critical telomere shortening via mechanisms dependent on Rad52-dependent homologous recombination (HR). Here we describe a third function for Sgs1 in telomerase-deficient cells, inhibition of survivors that grow independent of Rad52. Unlike tlc1 rad52 double mutants, which do not form survivors of telomere dysfunction, tlc1 rad52 sgs1 triple mutants readily generated survivors. After emerging from growth crisis, the triple mutants progressively lost telomeric and subtelomeric sequences, yet grew for more than 1 year. Analysis of cloned chromosome termini and of copy number changes of loci genome-wide using tiling arrays revealed terminal deletions extending up to 57 kb, as well as changes in Ty retrotransposon copy numbers. Amplification of the remaining terminal sequences generated large palindromes at some chromosome termini. Sgs1 helicase activity but not checkpoint function was essential for inhibiting the appearance of the survivors, and the continued absence of Sgs1 was required for the growth of the established survivors. Thus, in addition to facilitating the maintenance of telomere repeat sequences via HR-dependent mechanisms, a RecQ helicase can prevent the adoption of HR-independent mechanisms that stabilize chromosome termini without the use of natural telomere sequences. This provides a novel mechanism by which RecQ helicases may help maintain genome integrity and thus prevent age-related diseases and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2014638378,"Traditionally, quantification of protein-ligand affinity is performed using kinetic or equilibrium measurements. However, if the binding reaction proceeds via a stable covalent complex, these approaches are often limited. By exploiting the fact that the conformational stabilization of a protein is altered upon ligand binding due to specific interactions, and using an array of selectively chosen ligand analogs, one can quantify the contribution individual interactions have on specificity. We have used ligand-induced stability as a basis to dissect the interaction between glutaredoxin-3 (Grx3) and one of its native substrates, the tripeptide glutathione. Taking advantage of the fact that Grx3 can be trapped in a covalent mixed disulfide to glutathione or to selected synthetic glutathione analogs as part of the natural catalytic cycle, individual contributions to binding of specific molecular groups can be quantified by changes in ligand-induced stability. These changes in conformational stability are interpreted in terms of interaction energies (i.e. specificity) of the particular groups present on the ligand analog. Our results illustrate that although Grx3 recognizes glutathione predominantly through independent and additive ionic interactions at the N- and C-terminal of glutathione, van der Waals interactions from the unique γ-glutamate moiety of glutathione also play an important role. This study places us closer to understanding the complex task of accommodating multiple substrate specificities in proteins of the thioredoxin superfamily and underscores the general applicability of ligand-induced stability to probe substrate specificity.

This study places us closer to understanding the complex task of accommodating multiple substrate specificities in proteins of the thioredoxin superfamily and underscores the general applicability of ligand-induced stability to probe substrate specificity. In the era of structural genomics, a large number of biomolecules will have their tertiary structure determined. However, to fully appreciate the potential of these structures, it is fundamental to determine how these molecules interact with other molecules. Therefore, when exploring the structural basis of observed biological activity it is of great importance to investigate the details of intermolecular interactions. One way of attaining a deeper insight into these interactions is by quantifying ligand affinity, usually performed by kinetic or equilibrium measurements of the binding reaction. Specific interactions between a ligand and a protein can be investigated further by modifying specific residues within the protein using site-directed mutagenesis. The relative binding constants of a wild-type and a mutant protein to a particular ligand then provide information about specificity. However, protein mutagenesis sometimes results in secondary effects as intrinsic properties of the protein may be altered, making subsequent analysis complex. Furthermore, if the interaction between two molecules involves a relatively stable covalent intermediate, standard methods of measuring affinity are often of limited value. Several studies have demonstrated that the free energy of non-covalent binding of a ligand to a protein results in a change in conformational stabilization with respect to the non-bound form (1Pace C.N.

This observation also applies to cases where a covalent intermediate between a protein and a ligand is natural or artificial (5Kleanthous C. Reilly M. Cooper A. Kelly S. Price N.C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10893-10898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nagarajan R. Pratt R.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9664-9673Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Erlanson D.A. Wells J.A. Braisted A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 199-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). As suggested by Kleanthous et al. (5Kleanthous C. Reilly M. Cooper A. Kelly S. Price N.C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10893-10898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it should be feasible to utilize this ligand-induced stabilization more thoroughly and quantify the contribution individual interactions have on protein-ligand specificity. To our knowledge, none of these ligand-induced stabilizations have been exploited to dissect protein-ligand specificity. By quantifying the effect a natural ligand and a set of specifically designed ligand analogs (in which the ligand as opposed to the protein is altered) have on the conformational stability of a protein, specific molecular interactions can be separated using a thermodynamic cycle (Fig. 1). Using this approach, many shortcomings of conventional binding experiments are circumvented. Conformational stability can be quantified by determining the free energy differences between the folded protein-ligand complex and the unfolded complex (ΔGH2OUnfold) 2The abbreviations used are: ΔGH2OUnfold, free energy of protein unfolding; Grx3, E. coli glutaredoxin-3; ΔGH2OFold, free energy of folding (conformational stability); ΔΔG1, free energy difference between non-bound and ligand-bound form of a protein; ΔΔG2, difference between two ligand-bound forms of a protein; Grx3-SG, Grx3-glutathione-mixed disulfide. (8Pace C.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This can be achieved by the use of standard temperature or solute (e.g. guanidinium chloride or urea) induced unfolding experiments monitored by a suitable spectroscopic probe like absorbance, fluorescence, or circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. In this study we use ligand-induced stability changes to probe Escherichia coli glutaredoxin-3 (Grx3) substrate specificity using a C14S/C65Y mutant form of the protein in concert with its natural substrate glutathione (GSH, γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) and a set of synthetic glutathione analogs. The glutaredoxins are ubiquitous enzymes present in most organisms from virus and plants to humans (9Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) and are characterized by having a common tertiary structure, the thioredoxin fold (10Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The activities of the glutaredoxins are based on the reversible oxidation of an active site -CXXC-disulfide motif, in which only one or both active site cysteines are used (11Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3664-3671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite having some overlapping substrate preferences, the glutaredoxins display considerable variations in specificity, allowing them to participate in a large number of biological processes including reversible protein S-glutathionylation due to oxidative stress or redox signaling (12Gallogly M.M. Mieyal J.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2007; 7: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and DNA synthesis by supplying ribonucleotide reductase with electrons (13Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The general enzymatic mechanism proceeds via a covalent intermediary glutaredoxin-substrate mixed disulfide complex. Grx3 from E. coli displays extraordinary specificity for reducing protein-glutathione (SG) complexes (14Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 15Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), also referred to as glutathione-mixed disulfide complexes. The catalytic reaction proceeds naturally via nucleophilic attack of the N-terminal cysteine thiolate on the sulfur of the glutathione participating in the mixed disulfide, achieving deglutathionylation of the substrate by forming a transiently stable Grx-SG complex (16Åslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This so-called monothiol reaction does not require the C-terminal active site cysteine (17Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wüthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this cysteine is required for intramolecular disulfide formation with concurrent release of glutathione and forms an obligatory part of the dithiol mechanism. Because of the formation of the covalent Grx-SG mixed disulfide complex, standard equilibrium techniques for determining affinity are not optimal. Furthermore, while the Grx-SG mixed disulfide is transiently stable, the presence of the C-terminal cysteine creates the possibility of self-deglutathionylation. By mutating the C-terminal active site cysteine of glutaredoxin into a non-cysteine residue, it is possible to interrupt the catalytic mechanism and trap the Grx-SG mixed disulfide, forming a stable, covalent 1:1 complex. Using this active site mutation, a few examples of Grx-SG mixed disulfide structures have been determined (18Bushweller J.H. Billeter M. Holmgren A. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1585-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Yang Y. Jao S. Nanduri S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Qin J.

Proteins. 2008; 72: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and highlight the importance of electrostatics in the interactions between glutaredoxins and their substrates. To elucidate the importance of these observed interactions, we have quantified the contribution individual molecular groups in the natural substrate glutathione have on Grx3 ligand-induced stability. This has been achieved by comparing the conformational stabilities of the Grx3(C14S/C65Y) mutant in complex with glutathione and a selected set of synthetic analogs having various degrees of glutathione resemblance. The active site C14S mutation has been used successfully to trap intermediate mixed disulfides in E. coli Grx1 and Grx3 for structural studies (18Bushweller J.H. Billeter M. Holmgren A. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1585-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Nordstrand K. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The C14S mutations used throughout this study do not appear to affect the conformation of the proteins as judged by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra which are essentially indistinguishable from the proteins not carrying this mutation. 3T.

Biol. 2000; 303: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This mutant form of Grx3 has been shown to have an activity similar to the wild-type protein both in vitro (20Nordstrand K. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and in vivo. 3T. H. Elgán, A. G. Planson, J. Beckwith, P. Güntert, and K. D. Berndt, submitted manuscript. The differential stabilities (ΔΔG2) afforded by mixed disulfide formation between the Grx3(C14S/C65Y) mutant and the various analogs are interpreted as a measure of interaction energies (i.e. specificity). The conformational stability of each mixed disulfide complex was determined by standard urea unfolding experiments monitored by CD spectroscopy at 222 nm. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of ligand-induced stability to quantify the contribution individual interactions have on specificity, and provide further details about substrate specificity of Grx3. Protein Expression and Purification—Mutant Grx3 was prepared from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with a pET-24D-plasmid containing the gene for Grx3(C14S/C65Y) (16Åslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The protein was expressed and purified as follows. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB media, supplemented with kanamycin, until A600 had reached 0.6. Induction was initiated by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm final concentration), and cells were harvested after 4 h of expression. The resulting cell pellet was subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles and thereafter dissolved in 20 mm Tris HCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer at pH 8.0. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was reduced by dithiotreitol and loaded onto a DE52 anion column (Whatman) and eluted with a 1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer at pH 8.0, using a gradient from 0 to 30% (v/v). Fractions containing Grx3(C14S/C65Y) were pooled and concentrated by pressure dialysis using a membrane with a 3-kDa cutoff (Amicon YM3, Millipore). The resulting sample was further purified using size-exclusion chromatography (Sephadex G-50, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 μm EDTA buffer at pH 7.0. Grx3(C14S/C65Y)-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated as above. Expression and purification of Grx1(C14S) was performed as for the wild-type protein and has been described elsewhere (25Sagemark J. Elgán T.H. Bürglin T.R. Johansson C. Holmgren A. Berndt K.D. Proteins. 2007; 68: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Characterization of the proteins was performed by RP HPLC (Chemstation 1100, Agilent Technologies) using a C18 semi-preparative column (218TPB510 10 × 250 mm, Vydac) and ESI-MS (Finnigan MAT LCQ). Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using a theoretical extinction coefficient of 5120 m-1 cm-1 for reduced Grx3(C14S/C65Y), 5240 m-1 cm-1 for Grx3(C14S/C65Y) mixed disulfides, 10810 m-1 cm-1 for reduced Grx1(C14S) and 10930 m-1 cm-1 for Grx1(C14S) mixed disulfides (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis—The Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Cys(trt)-OH, Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH, and Fmoc-γ-aminobutyric acid amino acids, the 2-chlorotrityl chloride and rink amide MBHA resins, and all reagents were purchased from Novabiochem; solvents were from Perseptive Biosystems. Peptides were synthesized manually in 1-mmol batches using standard Fmoc solid phase peptide chemistry (27Chan W.C. White P.D. Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Eynsham, Oxford2000Google Scholar) employing PyBOP/HOBt as a coupling reagent in a 50-ml reaction vessel (Chemglass Inc.). Peptide C-terminal acids were obtained by the use of a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin while peptide amides were synthesized by using a rink amide MBHA resin. Following Fmoc-deprotection, all peptides were cleaved from their respective resins using trifluoroacetic acid-dichloromethane-water-triisopropylsilane (82.5:5:5:7.5 vol%) and recovered by water extraction and subsequent lyophilization using a speed-vac (SC100, Savant). The γ-carboxybutaryl-Cys-Gly and butaryl-Cys-Gly peptide disulfides were prepared by adding a 15-fold molar excess glutaric acid anhydride (Merck) and butyric anhydride (Merck), respectively, to cysteinylglycine disulfide (Bachem) in methanol/triethylamine (10-fold molar excess). The reactions were followed by RP HPLC and allowed to progress until there was no cysteinylglycine disulfide detected (<4 h). The acetyl(Ac)-Cys-NH2 disulfide was prepared by adding a 10-fold molar excess acetic anhydride (Merck) to cysteinylamide disulfide (Bachem) dissolved in acetonitrile/triethylamine (10-fold molar excess). All crude peptides were purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC and analyzed by ESI-MS. Protein-Peptide Mixed Disulfide Preparation—Glutathione disulfide (GSSG, Sigma), 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (Aldrich), cystine (Fluka) and acetylcysteine disulfide were purchased and used as is. The Fmoc synthesized peptides in their reduced forms were dissolved in deionized water adjusted to neutral pH and left for 1 day at 4 °C to facilitate oxidation and subsequent homodimerization. Thereafter the oxidized peptides were lyophilized and dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 μm EDTA buffer at pH 7.0. Solubility difficulties were encountered with the Ac-Cys-NH2 disulfide. However, the addition of urea to a final concentration of 1 m (not sufficient to denature the protein) facilitated solvation. Prior to mixed disulfide formation, the mutant protein was reduced using a 100-fold molar excess dithiothreitol, which was removed after 30 min by gel filtration (PD-10, GE Healthcare). Mixed disulfide formation was achieved by incubating reduced mutant protein (typically at a concentration of ∼0.2 mm) overnight at 4 °C with 50-fold molar excess substrate disulfide. Excess substrate was removed by gel filtration as above. Quantitative mixed disulfide formation was confirmed by RP-HPLC and ESI-MS as above. Free Energies of Unfolded State Mixed Disulfides—Stock solutions of GSSG, (Ac-Cys)2, and (Cys-NH2)2 were prepared. The concentration of each compound was determined by quantitative amino acid composition analysis using ortho-phtalaldehyde (OPA) as a derivatization agent following acid hydrolysis (28Fountoulakis M. Lahm H.W. J. Chromatogr. 1998; 826: 109-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Concentrations were calculated based on the total amount of cystine in each sample. Equimolar mixtures of GSSG/(Ac-Cys)2, GSSG/(Cys-NH2)2, and (Ac-Cys-OH)2/Cys2 (each peptide at 1.5 mm, 100-fold molar excess relative protein) were prepared in a 50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 μm EDTA solution at pH 7.0 containing urea (7.9 m final concentration). The experiment was initiated by the addition of Grx3(C14S/C65Y) to a final concentration of 15 μm and left to equilibrate at room temperature in a sealed tube purged with nitrogen gas. Samples were taken after 3, 22, and 26 h and quenched by the addition of 50 μl1 m phosphoric acid to 100 μl of protein/peptide solution. All samples were analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC using a 4.6 × 250 mm C8 column (208TP54, Vydac). The samples were eluted using a gradient from 29 to 38% (v/v) acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min and monitored at 214 nm. The resulting chromatograms were integrated using the multipeak fitting routine in the Igor Pro software package (WaveMetrics). CD Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD spectra of native Grx3(C14S/C65Y) and Grx3(C14S/C65Y) mixed disulfide complexes were measured at 25 °C using a 50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 μm EDTA buffer at pH 7.0 and a protein concentrations of ∼17 μm. Data were collected in a 0.2-cm quartz cuvette (Hellma) using an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter, collecting ellipticity between 260 and 190 nm every 1.0 nm using a bandwidth of 1.5 nm for 10 s. The far-UV CD measurements at various urea concentrations were performed as above with the exception that a 2.0-nm bandwidth was used. Five different urea concentrations were selected for each sample based on their corresponding urea unfolding curve. Conformational stabilities of the mutant in its reduced form and various mixed disulfide forms were measured by urea (ICN Biomedicals) unfolding experiments monitored by CD spectroscopy at 222 nm. Measurements were performed in the same buffer as above and protein concentrations ranged from 3.3 to 5.5 μm. Semi-automated solute titrations were performed using a 2-syringe pipetting robot (Hamilton, Microlab 500). Urea concentration was increased in 0.1 m steps from 0 to 8 m directly in the stirred 1-cm path length cuvette. Ellipticity at 222 nm was measured for 30 s following a 7-min equilibration time using a 1.5 nm bandwidth. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C for all experiments. Reversibility was confirmed for the reduced form of Grx3(C14S/C65Y) by reverse titration with the resulting refolding curve essentially superimposable onto the unfolding curve. All other mixed disulfide complexes were assumed to undergo the same reversibility. Assuming that unfolding of a protein or protein mixed disulfide in the presence of a solute is a reversible two-state process between the folded (f) and unfolded (u) forms, an equation (Equation 1) for the experimental observable (yobs) can be derived as previously described (29Pace C.N. Scholtz M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Eynsham, Oxon1997: 299-321Google Scholar, 30Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W.

To account for observed linear spectral changes with respect to increasing solute concentration ([D]), parameters describing the linear pre- and post-transition dependence (mu and mf, respectively) are also included. Raw data were weighted with the inverse of the standard deviation of each measured CD value and fit to Equation 1 using non-linear least-square regression analysis within the Igor Pro software package. Fitted coefficients are reported ± 1 S.D. Values describing the conformational stabilities are reported in terms of the folding reaction using the following relationship ΔGH2OFold = -ΔGH2OUnfold. Derived values (i.e. ΔΔG and [Urea]½) are reported with errors propagated accordingly. Synthetic Glutathione Analogs and Grx3-mixed Disulfide Preparation—In an attempt to quantify the importance individual interactions between Grx3 and glutathione have on specificity, a set of synthetic glutathione analogs were designed based on commercially available compounds for Fmoc peptide synthesis. The selected analogs were synthesized and purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by RP-HPLC and ESI-MS (data not shown). The molecular weight of each trapped and purified ligand-Grx3(C14S/C65Y) mixed disulfide was determined by analytical RP HPLC and ESI-MS (data not shown) and used as evidence of a 1:1 complex. Unfolded State Free Energies of Grx3-ligand Mixed Disulfides—In order for the thermodynamic linkage in Fig. 1 to be true, it is crucial that the differences in unfolded state free energies between the different Grx3 mixed disulfides are known. When comparing glutathione with the synthetic analogs used in this study (Fig. 2) it is obvious that the incremental differences between the analogs, should only make a negligible contribution to the corresponding complex when unfolded. The difference in free energies of the unfolded state mixed disulfides are therefore expected to be similar whereas unfolded oxidized and reduced active site -CXXC-containing proteins differ by ∼1 kcal mol-1 (16Åslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 25Sagemark J. Elgán T.H. Bürglin T.R. Johansson C. Holmgren A. Berndt K.D. Proteins. 2007; 68: 879-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) due to the entropic penalty of forming a cross-link in the polypeptide chain (31Pace C.N. Grimsley G.R. Thomson J.A. Barnett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11820-11825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assumption of the similarity of free energies of the unfolded state mixed disulfides can be tested by exposing unfolded Grx3 to two ligand peptides at equimolar concentration. If the two corresponding unfolded Grx3 mixed disulfides are present at an equimolar ratio at thermodynamic equilibrium, their unfolded state energies are equal. Three peptides were selected representing the extremes in terms of the impact they have on Grx3(C14S/C65Y) stability (Table 1). Mixtures under denaturing conditions were set up where mutant Grx3 was allowed to react with two peptides at equimolar concentrations. All samples had reached equilibrium after 22 h and the resulting mixed disulfide species were quantified by RP HPLC (Fig. 3). Equilibrium was judged by the fact that longer equilibration resulted in identical peak intensities. Since the retention times for the glutathione and Cys-NH2 mixed disulfides with Grx3(C14S/C65Y) were identical, it was only possible to assay these two peptides (in their homodimeric forms) separately with Ac-Cys disulfide. As seen in Fig. 3, the peak areas of the mutant Grx3-(Ac-Cys) mixed disulfides are slightly larger than 50%. This is due to the fact that these peaks also include corresponding Grx3(C14S/C65Y) N-terminal methionine-containing mixed disulfide isoforms (<7%) with glutathione and Cys-NH2. Heterogeneity with respect to the N-terminal methionine is a consequence of incomplete processing in the expression system. However, all peaks can properly be quantified using the multipeak fitting routine in the Igor Pro software and the similarity of the resulting peak areas (<6% difference) demonstrate that Grx3(C14S/C65Y) in the unfolded state does not significantly discriminate between the tested peptides. Therefore it can be concluded that the free energies of the unfolded state mixed disulfides of these analogs are degenerate, and we assume the same is true for the other analogs used in this study.TABLE 1Parameters (±1 S.D.) obtained from non-linear regression of the data to Eq. 1 and derived values, demonstrating the impact each substrate has upon Grx3(C14S/C65Y) mixed disulfide formationMixed disulfide complexΔGH2OFoldaThe conformational stability (ΔGH2OFold) is given as the free energy of folding in the absence of urea.ΔΔG1bΔΔG1 indicates the folding free energy contribution of substrate binding relative the non-bound Grx3(C14S/C65Y) as noted by a dash.[Urea]½c[Urea]½ is the midpoint of the urea unfolding curve.mtransdmtrans is the slope of the urea dependence of the measured free energies within the transition region of the unfolding curve.kcal mol−1kcal mol−1mkcal mol−1 m−1Grx3(C14S/C65Y)-ligand mixed disulfidesCyseThe Grx3(C14S/C65Y)-(Cys) mixed disulfide was too unstable for determination of reliable data (not applicable, n.a.).n.a.n.a.n.a.n.a.Cys-NH2−2.13 ± 0.092.57 ± 0.121.38 ± 0.07−1.54 ± 0.04β-Mercaptoethanol−2.13 ± 0.092.57 ± 0.121.38 ± 0.07−1.54 ± 0.04Cys-Gly−3.07 ± 0.051.63 ± 0.092.06 ± 0.04−1.49 ± 0.02α-Glu-Cys-NH2−3.24 ± 0.061.46 ± 0.102.31 ± 0.05−1.40 ± 0.02Ac-Cys-NH2−3.35 ± 0.041.35 ± 0.092.58 ± 0.04−1.30 ± 0.01α-Glu-Cys-Gly−3.74 ± 0.050.96 ± 0.092.85 ± 0.06−1.31 ± 0.02α-Glu-Cys−3.83 ± 0.120.87 ± 0.142.92 ± 0.13−1.31 ± 0.04butaryl-Cys-Gly−4.48 ± 0.070.22 ± 0.113.15 ± 0.07−1.42 ± 0.02γ-Aminobutaryl-Cys-Gly−4.62 ± 0.120.08 ± 0.14fThe differences are not significantly different from zero.4.09 ± 0.15−1.13 ± 0.03Grx3(C14S/C65Y)gNon-bound protein.−4.70 ± 0.08-3.85 ± 0.09−1.22 ± 0.02Ac-Cys−4.78 ± 0.08−0.08 ± 0.11fThe differences are not significantly different from zero.3.44 ± 0.08−1.39 ± 0.02γ-Glu-Cys-NH2−4.95 ± 0.10−0.25 ± 0.134.54 ± 0.12−1.09 ± 0.02γ-Carbox"

We identified an embryonic stem cell-derived discrete, nonclonal cell population expressing the two vascular endothelial growth factor receptors neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) and Flk1 that differentiates in vitro toward endothelial or neural phenotypes depending on microenvironmental cues. When microinjected in the chick embryo, Nrp1(+) cells integrate within the host, developing vessels and brain, and acquire endothelial and neural markers, respectively. These results show that precursors of endothelial cells and precursors of neural cells arise from the same pool of differentiating embryonic stem cells and share the expression of Nrp1 and Flk1. These data reinforce the parallelism between vascular and nervous system at the level of cell fate and commitment and open new perspective in regenerative medicine of neurovascular diseases."
