https://openalex.org/W2064059449,"The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt has recently been shown to be implicated in the pathway leading to cell survival in response to serum and growth factors in a variety of cellular systems. However, the existence of a biochemical route connecting this kinase to the large family of receptors that signal through heterotrimeric G proteins is yet to be explored. In this study, we set out to investigate whether GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can stimulate Akt activity and survival pathways and, if so, to define the mechanism(s) whereby this class of cell surface receptors could regulate Akt function. Using ectopic expression of GPCRs in COS-7 cells as a model, we have observed that both m1 and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, representative of those GPCRs coupled to G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>i</sub>proteins, respectively, can readily activate an epitope-tagged form of Akt kinase and prevent UV-induced apoptosis. We have also found that the pathway connecting G proteins to Akt implicates signals emanating from Gα<sub>q</sub>, Gα<sub>i</sub>, and βγ dimers, but not from Gα<sub>s</sub> or Gα<sub>12</sub>, in each case acting through a pathway that involves a phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase activity. Moreover, our findings suggest a role for a novel βγ-sensitive complex, p101·phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-γ, in the transduction of signals leading to Akt stimulation and cell survival by GPCRs and open new avenues for research on the function of the large family of G protein-linked receptors in the regulation of anti-apoptotic pathways."

As in the severe human infantile disease (Pompe Syndrome), mice homozygous for disruption of the acid α-glucosidase gene (6neo/6neo) lack enzyme activity and begin to accumulate glycogen in cardiac and skeletal muscle lysosomes by 3 weeks of age, with a progressive increase thereafter. By 3.5 weeks of age, these mice have markedly reduced mobility and strength. They grow normally, however, reach adulthood, remain fertile, and, as in the human adult disease, older mice accumulate glycogen in the diaphragm. By 8–9 months of age animals develop obvious muscle wasting and a weak, waddling gait. This model, therefore, recapitulates critical features of both the infantile and the adult forms of the disease at a pace suitable for the evaluation of enzyme or gene replacement.

Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2443-2464Google Scholar). The most severe form, Pompe Syndrome, is a rapidly progressive disease in which heart failure is fatal in infancy. In milder forms, there is progressive skeletal muscle weakness, and death may result from pulmonary failure secondary to diaphragmatic weakness as late as the seventh decade. There is currently no effective therapy, but several candidate therapies, based on the discovery that acid α-glucosidase, like many other lysosomal enzymes, is secreted and can be taken up through cell surface mannose-6-phosphate receptors on other cells (3van der Ploeg A.T.

Bijvoet et al. (1Bijvoet A.G. van de Kamp E.H. Kroos M. Ding J.H. Yang B.Z. Visser P. Bakker C.E. Verbeet M.P. Oostra B.A. Reuser A.J.J. van der Ploeg A.T. Hum Mol Genet. 1998; 7: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) recently reported the generation of knockout mice which develop generalized glycogen storage and cardiomegaly but remain phenotypically normal. We describe here the generation of two models: 1) knockout mice in which the GAA gene is disrupted by a neo insertion in exon 6 (6neo/6neo) and 2) mutant mice in which exon 6 of the GAA gene and the neo gene are removed by Cre/lox-mediated recombination (Δ6/Δ6) (13Sauer B. Henderson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5166-5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). In both models, animals develop biochemical and pathological changes similar to those in humans, but only 6neo/6neo mice show early signs of reduced mobility and muscle strength. By 8–9 months of age 6neo/6neo mice develop a weak, waddling gait, and progressive muscle wasting. GAA genomic clones were isolated from a 129/Sv mouse genomic library. A plasmid containing both the neomycin-resistance (neo) gene and the herpes virus thymidine kinase gene in the pBluescript vector (a gift of Dr. R. Proia) served as the backbone of the targeting vector (14Yamanaka S. Johnson M.D. Grinberg A. Westphal H. Crawley J.N. Taniike M. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9975-9979Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The organization of the targeting construct is shown in Fig. 1 A. A genomic fragment extending from an XbaI site in intron 2 to a BamHI site in exon 6 was inserted into theXhoI site between the thymidine kinase and neogenes. In addition, a termination codon and a new EcoRV site were introduced within exon 6 upstream from the neo gene. Next, a genomic fragment containing the remainder of exon 6 and exons 7 through 13 was cloned into the SalI site downstream of theneo gene. Two loxP sites were inserted into introns 5 and 6. The resulting vector has ∼2.7 kb of homology upstream and ∼4.3 kb of homology downstream of the neogene. The linearized vector was electroporated into 129/Sv RW4 ES cells (Genome Systems Inc.), and the resulting neo-positive (G418-resistant), thymidine kinase-negative (ganciclovir-resistant) clones were screened by Southern analysis. Chimeric mice were generated by blastocyst injection of heterozygous ES cells into 3.5-day C57BL/6 embryos. Six independent cell lines containing the disrupted GAA allele were used to make chimeras that were bred to C57BL/6 females to generate heterozygous mice (F1). Four mutant lines were then established through germ line transmission; heterozygous F1 mice derived from two independent cell lines, 2-55 and 2-86, were intercrossed to obtain mice homozygous for the disrupted allele (F2 and F3). Alternatively, F1/2-55 and F1/2-86 heterozygous mice were bred to EIIa-cre transgenic mice (FVB/N) for Cre-mediated deletion (Δ6/Δ6) of the neo gene and exon 6 of the GAA gene in vivo. GAA activity in the homogenates of skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and tail was measured as conversion of the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-glucoside to the fluorescent product umbelliferone as described previously (1Bijvoet A.G. van de Kamp E.H. Kroos M. Ding J.H. Yang B.Z. Visser P. Bakker C.E. Verbeet M.P. Oostra B.A. Reuser A.J.J. van der Ploeg A.T. Hum Mol Genet. 1998; 7: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Hermans M.M. Kroos M.A. van Beeumen J. Oostra B.A. Reuser A.J. J Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13507-13512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissues were dissected and homogenized in lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) with proteinase inhibitors (4 mm Pefabloc SC, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Samples (50 μg protein) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked with bovine serum albumin and incubated with rabbit antiserum to human placental GAA or rabbit antiserum to human urine GAA (kindly provided by Dr. F. Martiniuk and Dr. A. J. J. Reuser). Immunodetection was performed with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in combination with chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Life Science Inc.). RNA was isolated from skeletal muscle and liver using a Total RNA Kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis was primed from 2 μg of total RNA with 50 ng of random hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). Two μl of the cDNA sample were used as a template for PCR amplification with primers flanking the neo gene: cctttctacctggcactggaggac (exon 5 sense) and ggacaatggcggtcgaggagta (exon 7 antisense) or tcaccctctggaaccgggacacacca (exon 4 sense) and ccggccatcctggtgcagctcccgca (exon 8 antisense). The second set of primers was used to detect any possible transcripts in which theneo gene may be spliced out. PCR reactions were carried out for 35 cycles that consisted of 50-s denaturation at 95 °C, 50-s annealing at 55 °C, and 2-min extension at 72 °C using PCR SuperMix (Life Technologies, Inc.). Genomic DNA isolated from ES cells or mouse tails was digested with EcoRV, electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, and transferred to Nytran membranes. The hybridization probe was generated by PCR, and labeled by the random hexamer method after gel purification. For electron microscopy, tissues were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde followed by post-fixation in 1% osmium in 0.1m cacodylate buffer. The tissues were rinsed in an aqueous solution containing 4.5% sucrose, dehydrated in a series of graded alcohol solutions, rinsed in 100% propylene oxide, and embedded in epoxy resin. Thin sections (60 to 70 nm) were double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The stained sections were stabilized by carbon evaporation and photographed with a Hitachi H7000 electron microscope operated at 75 kV. For light microscopy, sections from tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, processed, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) by standard methods. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Locomotor activity in an open field was measured in a Digiscan apparatus (model RXYZCM, Omnitech Electronics). Total distance, horizontal activity, and vertical activity were measured by the total number of photocell beam breaks in 10- or 15-min intervals over 1 h, and data averaged over these periods were used for analysis. Three to six independent testing sessions were conducted for each group over a period of 1–2 weeks. Male mice were tested at ages 3.5–6, 8–9, and 10.5–22 weeks. Fourteen 6neo/+, 11 6neo/6neo, 8 Δ6/+, and 9 Δ6/Δ6 mice were used for the test. The origin of the mice which were phenotypically tested is indicated in TableI. Statistical analyses were performed using the one-way analysis of variance test (Sigmastat program). The ability to hang upside down from a wire screen placed 60 cm above a large housing cage was measured as latency to fall into the cage.Table IOrigin of the mice used for behavioral testingCell lineMouse line2–552–862–55/cre2–86/cre6neo/+1 /7/1aF1 mice/F2 mice/F3 mice (n).1 /4/06neo/6neo2 /1bF2 mice/F3 mice (n).3 /5Δ6/+0 /5/03 /0/0Δ6/Δ63 /60 /0a F1 mice/F2 mice/F3 mice (n).b F2 mice/F3 mice (n). Open table in a new tab The murine GAA gene was disrupted by insertion of neointo exon 6, with the expectation that the disruption would completely block gene expression (6neo/6neo). In addition,loxP sites were placed in the introns flanking the disrupted exon 6 so that exon 6 could be precisely removed (Δ6) by mating to Cre-producing mice. In humans, a similar splicing mutation around exon 6 is associated with a relatively mild phenotype (16Adams E.M. Becker J.A. Griffith L. Segal A. Plotz P.H. Raben N. Hum Mutat. 1997; 10: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By homologous recombination in ES cells, we created a mutant GAA allele in which a neo cassette disrupts the gene within exon 6 (Fig. 1 A). A termination codon and a new EcoRV site were introduced into exon 6 upstream from theneo gene. Translational termination at the stop codon in exon 6 would result in the synthesis of a truncated protein of ∼36 kDa. The frequency of recombination was 1 in 4 G418/ganciclovir-resistant clones. Recombinant clones were used to produce chimeric mice that transmitted the mutation through the germ line. Heterozygous mice (F1) derived from two independent cell lines (2-55 and 2-86) carrying the targeted allele were used for further breeding. Genotyping of the mice generated by intercrossing of heterozygotes (Fig. 1 B) revealed the expected Mendelian ratio, indicating no effect on embryonic development. Reverse transcription-PCR with two sets of primers flanking theneo gene detected wild-type products in the wild-type (+/+) and heterozygous (+/−) but not in 6neo/6neo (−/−) mice (Fig. 1 C), indicating that normal mRNA is not made in homozygotes. However, mRNA amplification with primers in exon 12 (sense) and exon 14 (antisense) downstream from the neo gene detected a low level of transcripts in 6neo/6neo mice (not shown). Similarly, RT-PCR with primers in exon 5 (sense) and theneo gene (antisense) detected a very low abundance message in the 6neo/6neo; reamplification of the PCR product with nested primers followed by sequencing established that the termination codon introduced into exon 6 upstream from the neo gene remained intact (not shown). In homozygous mice, no GAA protein was detected by Western analysis (Fig. 1 D) using antibodies against either human urine or human placental GAA. The absence of functional protein in 6neo/6neo mice was confirmed by enzyme assay in the lysates of multiple tissues (TableII). The residual levels of enzyme activity (at the standard pH 4.3) in the muscle, heart, and tail samples of 6neo/6neo mice did not exceed the background level found in a fibroblast cell line from an infantile patient (0.64 nmol of 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-glucoside/h/mg of protein; cell line 4912) in which mRNA is not expressed (17Martiniuk F.

At low pH 3.6 (1Bijvoet A.G. van de Kamp E.H. Kroos M. Ding J.H. Yang B.Z. Visser P. Bakker C.E. Verbeet M.P. Oostra B.A. Reuser A.J.J. van der Ploeg A.T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 13507-13512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Abnormal lysosomal glycogen storage was found in the heart and skeletal muscle of 6neo/6neo mice. Electron microscopy showed the progressive accumulation of membrane-limited organelles between the bundles of myofibrils at the earliest point examined - age 3 weeks (Fig. 2 a and d). Immunoelectron microscopy with an antibody specific for the LAMP-1 protein confirmed that the organelles were lysosomes (not shown). Over time, the lysosomes increased in size and number (Fig. 2, b, c, e, andf). Furthermore, the density of the accumulated glycogen particles within the lysosomes increased (Fig. 2, h andi). The accumulation was clearly more marked in the heart than in the skeletal muscle (Fig. 2, d–f anda–c). Importantly, in the 6neo/6neo mice, there is a significant reduction in the number of myofibrils, loss of lateral myofibrillar registration, and signs of sacromere degradation, especially the deformation at the Z lines. Some lysosomes appear broken, suggesting that the leakage of lysosomal proteases may have contributed to the damage of the muscle structure. Light microscopy (at 8 weeks) showed PAS-positive, diastase-sensitive material in vacuoles in the heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 3, b and d). In animals examined at 14 weeks, the diaphragm showed PAS-positive vacuoles by light microscopy (Fig. 3 f). Although the mutant mice appeared normal, when placed in an open field environment 6neo/6neo mice consistently performed significantly worse than heterozygous littermates by several measures of locomotion (Fig. 4). Reduced activity was registered as early as 3.5 weeks of age and was particularly striking for vertical motion (Fig. 4, bottom panel). Similarly, in the wire-hang task, which measures muscular function and grip strength, 6neo/+ mice outperformed 6neo/6neo littermates. At 15–16 weeks of age, 6neo/6neo mice were almost never able to hold on to the inverted screen for more than 2 min (once in 12 tests), whereas in 8 of 12 tests 6neo/+ littermates were able to remain hanging for more than 2 min, and 4 of 12 heterozygous littermates were still holding on at 5 min when the test was stopped. Older mice (8–9 months of age) show obvious signs of muscle weakness with a weak, waddling gait and muscle wasting (Fig. 5). Offspring from independent mutant mouse lines were phenotypically indistinguishable.Figure 5Clinical signs of muscle weakness. This 8-month-old female 6neo/6neo mouse has wasted lower back muscle and displays its hind limbs in a splayed posture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the second model, the disrupted exon 6 of the GAA gene and the neo gene were totally excised from early embryos by breeding 6neo/+ mice (F1/2-55 and F1/2-86; 129/C57BL/6 background) to transgenic homozygous EIIa-cre (18Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Gorman J.R. Sauer B. Okamoto Y. Lee E. Alt F.W. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

F1 heterozygous (mouse lines 2-55/cre and 2-86/cre) for exon 6-deleted allele were subsequently intercrossed to obtain F2 and F3 homozygous mice (Δ6/Δ6). Cre-mediated deletion was detected by PCR with primers in exon 5 and exon 7 (Fig. 6). As expected, the genomic sequence in homozygous mice contained the 5′ part of intron 5, then a singleloxP site in place of exon 6, followed by the 3′ part of intron 7 and exon 7 of the gene (not shown). RT-PCR with two sets of primers (in exons 5/7 and exons 4/8) showed that the mutant mRNA is produced (Fig. 7 A), and that in this mRNA exon 5 is spliced to exon 7, resulting in a precise in-frame deletion of exon 6 (not shown).Figure 7Expression of the exon 6-deleted allele. A, RT-PCR analysis of muscle cDNA from Δ6/Δ6 mice. Primers in exons 4 and 8 detect a 354-bp amplification product; primers in exons 5 and 7 detect a 150-bp product.

Strikingly, however, unlike the 6neo/6neomice, their performance in the open field was similar to that of heterozygous Δ6/+ littermates derived from two mouse lines (Fig. 9, Table I). Interestingly, in all measures of activity, the Δ6/+ mice outperformed the 6neo/+ animals, indicating a genetic difference between the two mouse strains. So far (up to 6.5 months of age) the Δ6/Δ6 mice have not developed any clinical symptoms.Figure 9Locomotor activity of mice with exon 6 deletion (heterozygotes, Δ6/+; homozygotes, Δ6/Δ6), and exon 6 disruption (heterozygotes, 6neo/+; homozygotes, 6neo/6neo).

The approach required the production of only one targeted mouse line with an exon 6 disrupted allele, which served as a progenitor of the second line with exon 6 deleted allele. Since the targeted locus contains two loxP sites flanking exon 6, the removal of the exon was performed simply by mating to transgenic mice carrying Cre recombinase. The two models were designed to replicate a range of clinical phenotypes: 6neo/6neo mice for a severe phenotype, and Δ6/Δ6 mice for a milder disease. A milder phenotype was predicted in the Δ6/Δ6 mice since a similar, though not identical defect in a patient, splicing out exon 6 and the inclusion of 7 new amino acids encoded by 21 nucleotides from IVS6, resulted in 5–7% of residual enzyme activity and a juvenile form of the illness (16Adams E.M. Becker J.A. Griffith L. Segal A. Plotz P.H. Raben N. Hum Mutat. 1997; 10: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both mouse models, however, resulted in apparently complete “knockout,” as shown by the virtual absence of enzyme activity and the absence of GAA protein. In humans, the severity and the age of onset of GSDII appear to depend largely on the level of residual activity of the enzyme. Lack of enzyme activity or extremely low levels (≤1–2%) are associated with a fatal infantile cardiomyopathy, whereas levels of 10–20% are associated with an adult onset indolent skeletal myopathy (19Reuser A.J.

In contrast, 6neo/6neomice develop a progressive muscle weakness detectable as early as 3.5 weeks of age. The pathologic findings in 6neo/6neo mice indicate accumulation of lysosomal glycogen in the skeletal muscle and diaphragm, as in the adult human disease, and an even greater accumulation in heart, a hallmark of infantile disease. Tests of cardiac function will allow determination of the effects of the glycogen accumulation in the heart. In quantitative tests of mobility and strength, 6neo/6neomice moved less, especially in the vertical direction, and could not hold on to a wire screen nearly as long as 6neo/+ littermates. By 8–9 months, clinical signs of muscle weakness and muscle wasting are obvious. Longer observation will be necessary to determine if this reduced strength affects lifespan and if glycogen accumulation in the diaphragm reduces lung function. Thus, the 6neo/6neo model has features of both the adult and the infantile forms of the human disease, but the effects are attenuated. This difference in severity and in pace between mice and humans is not surprising since the factors which promote lysosomal glycogen storage are largely obscure. In humans, for example, the deposition of glycogen is very different from tissue to tissue within the same patient and from patient to patient or even sibling to sibling although they may bear the same mutation(s). Of related interest in that regard are the observations that although both the 6neo/6neo and Δ6/Δ6 mice have negligible enzyme activity and accumulate glycogen in skeletal and heart muscles, the 6neo/6neo are weak in open field and wire hang testing, but the Δ6/Δ6 are not. The phenotypic difference between the two models described here cannot be explained by the presence of a neo gene in the targeted locus of the 6neo/6neomice: in both the phenotypically affected 6neo/6neo model and a recently published phenotypically normal model with insertion of aneo gene in exon 13, a hybrid GAA-neo mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. Furthermore, we have studied the expression of the neo gene in a mouse strain with disruption of the HexA gene which is known to perform normally in the open field (14Yamanaka S. Johnson M.D. Grinberg A. Westphal H. Crawley J.N. Taniike M. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9975-9979Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this strain, abundant neo transcripts were detected in both liver and muscle by RT-PCR and sequencing (not shown), thus further indicating no effect of neo phosphotransferase on mobility and muscle strength. It is possible that the accumulation of glycogen is different in the muscles crucial for the activities tested; or that accumulation of glycogen in other sites such as the nervous system differs in the two models; or that weakness is related not only to the amount of accumulated glycogen. Indeed, the structural changes in myofibrillar structure may relate to other factors besides simple glycogen accumulation which are involved in lysosomal integrity. In support of the last possibility, it should be noted that the two strains are of different genetic background since the creation of the Δ6/Δ6 required mating to a strain bearing the Cre recombinase (FVB/N) while the 6neo/6neo mice were bred onto a C57BL/6 background. There is abundant similar evidence illustrating the importance of genetic background and modifying genes on phenotypic variation in knockout mice (22Erickson R.P. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Wilson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9, the background activity of the Cre strain control mice is substantially greater than that of the controls for the 6neo/6neo mice, suggesting that other genes influence behavior in the tests, and only in the less active strain is the additional insult of glycogen accumulation reflected in poorer performance. Such strain differences may account for the apparent absence of weakness in the recently published model (1Bijvoet A.G. van de Kamp E.H. Kroos M. Ding J.H. Yang B.Z. Visser P. Bakker C.E. Verbeet M.P. Oostra B.A. Reuser A.J.J. van der Ploeg A.T. Hum Mol Genet. 1998; 7: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which, like the Δ6/Δ6 model described here, was created on the 129/FVB background. It should be noted that the level of residual activity in the exon 13 model was somewhat higher (2.6% in muscle and 3.8% in heart) than the levels in the 6neo/6neoand the Δ6/Δ6 mice when measured at the same low pH 3.6. At that low pH, neither of the knockout strains described here had detectable activity in tail skin, muscle, or heart. It is possible that a residual low level of enzyme activity contributes to rescue of the phenotype of the exon 13 published knockout (1Bijvoet A.G. van de Kamp E.H. Kroos M. Ding J.H. Yang B.Z. Visser P. Bakker C.E. Verbeet M.P. Oostra B.A. Reuser A.J.J. van der Ploeg A.T. Hum Mol Genet. 1998; 7: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Longer observation of the Δ6/Δ6 mice (oldest animals are 6.5 months of age) may clarify this point. Although all of the models created so far could be used for testing proposed gene therapy or enzyme replacement since the pathological and biochemical changes closely resemble those in humans, the nondestructive and easily testable phenotypic abnormalities of the 6neo/6neo model suggest that it would be the preferable choice."

Heparin is synthesized by connective tissue type mast cells, as part of serglycin proteoglycans, and is subsequently stored intracellularly in cytoplasmic granules. Heparan sulfate (HS), 1The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate; aManR, 2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. structurally related to heparin, is also elaborated in proteoglycan form; contrary to heparin, heparan sulfate chains may be associated with a variety of core proteins (1David G.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans typically occur at the surface of most types of cells as well as in the extracellular matrix. They have been attributed a variety of biological effects that generally appear to be mediated through interactions between the constituent polysaccharide chains and various proteins (2Lindahl U.

The highly extended polysaccharide chains, M r60,000–100,000, of heparin proteoglycans may be cleaved shortly after completed biosynthesis, in the mast cell, into fragments similar in size to commercially available heparin (M r5000–25,000). The enzyme responsible for this conversion was identified as an endo-β-d-glucuronidase (6Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2690-2697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endoglycosidases capable of partially depolymerizing HS chains have been demonstrated in a variety of cells and tissues, such as placenta (7Klein U. von Figura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Such enzymes, commonly referred to as “heparanases,” contribute to the intracellular degradation of HS proteoglycans (15Yanagishita M. J. Biol.

Heparanases thus contribute to the remodeling of extracellular matrix and basement membranes prerequisite to angiogenesis (17Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Svahn C.M. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and to the egress of metastatic tumor cells (18Vlodavsky I. Mohsen M. Lider O. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ekre H.-P. Svahn C.M.

They may regulate growth factor action by releasing heparan sulfate-bound growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor from cell surfaces or from the extracellular matrix (20Ishai-Michaeli R.

Moreover, cleavage of HS chains on the vascular endothelium may affect the local concentration of HS with blood anticoagulant properties, thereby modulating the coagulation process (9Oldberg Å. Heldin C.-H. Wasteson Å. Busch C. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5755-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Studies by Oldberg et al. (9Oldberg Å. Heldin C.-H. Wasteson Å. Busch C. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5755-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) suggested that the heparanase obtained from human platelets cleaves endo-β-d-glucuronidic linkages in HS, thus mimicking the action of the heparin-degrading enzyme in mast cells. Similar endoglucuronidase activity was reported in subsequent similar studies on heparanases from different sources, such as human placenta (7Klein U. von Figura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 73: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), human platelets (23Oosta G.M. Favreau L.V. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

Ledbetter S.R. J. Biol.

These components and β-thromboglobulin are differently truncated forms of platelet basic protein, a member of the CXC-chemokine family. Several attempts have been made to define the substrate recognition properties of heparanases from various sources (6Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The approaches taken have involved structural comparison between polysaccharides susceptible or resistant to an enzyme, sequence analysis of fragments generated by enzymatic cleavage, and studies of inhibitory effects of chemically modified heparin derivatives. While most of these studies pointed to the importance of sulfate groups, no unified pattern emerged, and the minimal structural requirements for substrate recognition have remained to be defined. The aim of the present study was to pinpoint the substrate recognition properties of two heparanases from different sources, human hepatoma and platelets. Both enzymes were identified as endo-β-d-glucuronidases, based on their action on a well defined oligosaccharide substrate. Further model substrates were generated by systematic modification of the capsular polysaccharide generated by Escherichia coli K5, which has the same structure as the precursor polymer in heparin/HS biosynthesis. Testing various K5 polysaccharide derivatives as substrates for the heparanases revealed that whereas neither N-sulfate groups nor IdceA units are required for substrate recognition, the presence ofO-sulfate groups, particularly on the hexuronic acid units, appears to be essential for enzyme action. Platelet heparanase was partially purified from 500 ml of human platelet-rich plasma (kindly given by Dr. C.-H. Heldin, The Ludwig Institute, Uppsala, Sweden) according to a modification of a previously described procedure (23Oosta G.M. Favreau L.V. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11249-11255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme was recovered following fractionation on heparin-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B and (passage through) DEAE-Sephacel. The partially purified enzyme contained <3 μg of protein/ml and was stored in portions at −20 °C. Hepatoma heparanase was partially purified from a human hepatoma cell line (Sk-hep-1), essentially as described for the placental heparanase (32Goshen R. Hochberg A.A. Korner G. Levy E., R., I.-M. Elkin M. de Groot N. Vlodavsky I. Mol. Human Reprod. 1996; 2: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), omitting the ammonium sulfate precipitation and adding a second cation exchange (CM-Sepharose) chromatography at pH 7.2. Briefly, the cells were grown in suspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g of glucose/liter) containing 10% calf serum to a concentration of 106 cells/ml in batches of 50 liters. Cell lysate was subjected to 1) cation exchange (CM-Sepharose) chromatography performed at pH 6.0; 2) cation exchange (CM-Sepharose) chromatography at pH 7.2; 3) heparin-Sepharose chromatography at pH 7.2; and 4) ConA-Sepharose chromatography at pH 6.0. Active fractions were eluted by NaCl gradients in 10 mm phosphate citrate buffer (steps 1–3) and by phosphate citrate buffer containing 1m NaCl and 0.25 m α-methyl mannoside (step 4). The partially purified (∼240,000-fold purification) preparation eluted from ConA-Sepharose contained 10–20 μg of protein/ml and consisted primarily of a ∼46-kDa protein. Commercially available human heparanase was purchased as β-thromboglobulin from Calbiochem. Capsular polysaccharide fromE. coli K5 was kindly given by Dr. V. Cavazzoni (Department of Industrial Microbiology, University of Milan, Italy). A 35S-labeled heparin-like (or HS-like) polysaccharide was generated by incubating 25 μg of K5 polysaccharide with 4.8 mg of solubilized mouse mastocytoma microsomal enzymes and 3.5 MBq of 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phospho[35S]sulfate (PAPS) (specific activity, 6.6 TBq/mol), essentially as described by Kuscheet al. (33Kusche M. Hannesson H.H. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Anion exchange chromatography of the product on DEAE-Sephacel showed an elution position similar to that of standard chondroitin 4-sulfate from cartilage (data not shown). Metabolically 3H-labeled K5 polysaccharide was prepared by growing E. coli K5 in the presence ofd-[1-3H]glucose (34Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The products were partially or exhaustively chemically N-deacetylated (by hydrazinolysis) (35Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and were then N-sulfated (36Levy L. Petracek F.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962; 109: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A portion of ∼50% N-sulfated [3H]K5 polysaccharide was incubated with d-glucuronyl C-5 epimerase, purified from bovine liver, yielding a product in which ∼30% of the d-glucuronyl residues located between adjacent N-sulfated GlcN units had been converted into IdceA (34Campbell P.

Chemically O-sulfated K5 polysaccharide, obtained by treating the native product with pyridine-sulfur trioxide (according to route A as described by Casu et al. (37Casu B. Grazioli G. Razi N.

NMR analysis of this material indicated a fully 6-O-sulfated polysaccharide with some sulfate groups also on GlcUA. 2B. Casu, personal communication. The absence ofN-sulfate groups was shown by the resistance of the polysaccharide to depolymerization by HNO2 at pH 1.5 (38Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To radiolabel this material, 0.5 mg of the polysaccharide was first partially N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis (in 0.55 ml of hydrazine hydrate (Fluka) containing 1% hydrazine sulfate) at 100 °C for 5 min (35Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The sample was desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10% aqueous ethanol and lyophilized. The polysaccharide was cleaved at the generatedN-unsubstituted GlcN residues by nitrous acid treatment at pH 3.9 (38Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and labeled by reduction of the resultant terminal anhydromannose units with 0.5 mCi of NaB3H4(39Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3H-labeled product (specific activity, ∼100 × 103 cpm/μg of hexuronic acid) was recovered by gel filtration on Sephadex G-15 (1 × 150 cm) in 0.2m NH4HCO3 and further separated on a Superose 12 gel filtration column in 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Fractions containing material ofM r >5000 (specific activity, ∼10 × 103 cpm/μg of hexuronic acid) were pooled, dialyzed against H2O, and lyophilized. Chemically N- and O-sulfated K5 polysaccharide was as described (40Razi N. Feyzi E. Björk I. Naggi A. Casu B. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (preparation Bb-2, fraction 4, recovered after chromatography on antithrombin-Sepharose). This material was subjected to partial depolymerization by limited deamination at pH 1.5 followed by reduction of the products with NaB3H4 (40Razi N. Feyzi E. Björk I. Naggi A. Casu B. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Labeled polysaccharide (M r >5000; specific activity, ∼15 × 103 cpm/μg of hexuronic acid) was isolated by gel chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10 (1 × 150-cm column; fine grade) in 0.5 mNH4HCO3. N-[3H]Acetyl-labeled heparin (specific activity, 88 × 103 cpm/μg of hexuronic acid) was prepared as described by Höök et al.(41Höök M. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and separated into fractions with high and low affinity for antithrombin by affinity chromatography (42Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 100: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). An octasaccharide with high affinity for antithrombin was recovered following partial deaminative cleavage of heparin. Samples were labeled at the reducing end by reduction with NaB[3H]4 (specific activity of product, ∼100 × 103 cpm/μg of hexuronic acid) or by treatment with [14C]acetic anhydride followingN-deacetylation by hydrazinolysis (specific activity of product, ∼130 × 103 cpm/μg of hexuronic acid) (28Thunberg L.

A sample of 3H-labeled octasaccharide was degraded to labeled hexasaccharide by N-deacetylation followed by deamination (pH 3.9), and the hexasaccharide product was further converted to pentasaccharide by digestion with exo-β-d-glucuronidase (42Thunberg L.

Metabolically 35S-labeled HS was prepared by growing NIH-3T3 cells in a cell culture dish (15 cm in diameter) in 15 ml of sulfate-free Dulbecco′s modified Eagle's medium (with 1 mg/ml glucose, 13 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum) containing 3.7 MBq/ml35SO42− overnight. [35S]HS was isolated essentially as described (43Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Selective 2-O-desulfation was performed according to Jaseja et al. (Ref. 44Jaseja M. Rej R.N.

Res. 1997; 302: 103-108Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). AnN-[14C]acetyl-labeled heparin octasaccharide (670 × 103 cpm, 5.3 μg of hexuronic acid) with high affinity for antithrombin was mixed with 4 mg of heparin tetrasaccharide (derived from bovine lung heparin by partial deamination at pH 1.5) in a total volume of 1 ml of 0.13 mNaOH, pH 12.5. The mixture was frozen at −70 °C and lyophilized. The radiolabeled material was separated from the tetrasaccharide carrier on a column (1 × 200 cm) of Sephadex G-25 (superfine grade) in 0.2 m NH4HCO3 and lyophilized. 6-O-Desulfation (accompanied by some 2-O-desulfation) of 3H-labeled antithrombin-binding heparin octasaccharide was performed as described (46Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The pyridinium salt of the octasaccharide was treated with 1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol (10:1) at 90 °C for 3.5 h. After the addition of 1 ml of H2O, the pH was raised to ∼8 with NaOH. The sample was desalted on a PD-10 column in 0.2m NH4HCO3, lyophilized, and finally re-N-sulfated by treatment with trimethylamine-sulfur trioxide (36Levy L. Petracek F.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962; 109: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Samples of radiolabeled saccharide substrate, typically ∼10,000 dpm, were mixed with heparanase (generally ∼1 μg of hepatoma enzyme, ∼0.5 μg of platelet enzyme, 5 μg of β-thromboglobulin) in 10 mm citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 200 μl. Occasionally, an internal standard of35S-labeled heparan sulfate (10,000 dpm) was included as a positive control of enzyme activity. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, the samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The digests were mixed with 200 μl of 2 m NaCl, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% Triton X-100 and were then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm before gel chromatography. Control samples were incubated in parallel without the addition of enzyme. For compositional analysis of chemically O-sulfated K5 polysaccharide, the sample wasN-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis for 5 h and was then subjected to deaminative cleavage by treatment with HNO2 at pH 3.9 (38Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The resultant disaccharides were reduced with NaB3H4, isolated by gel chromatography, and finally analyzed by anion exchange HPLC on a Partisil-10 SAX column. For additional experimental details, see Ref. 47Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Structural analysis of N-sulfated saccharide was performed by deaminative cleavage (pH 1.5) at N-sulfated GlcN residues (38Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), followed by reduction with NaB3H4. The resultant 3H-labeled disaccharide was isolated by gel chromatography and analyzed by anion exchange HPLC. Digestion of oligosaccharides with exo-β-d-glucuronidase from bovine liver (type B-10; Sigma) was performed as described by Thunberg et al. (42Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 100: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Gel chromatography was performed as described in the figure legends. Fractions were analyzed by scintillation counting after the addition of OptiPhase “Hisafe” (Wallac). Incubations of radiolabeled heparan sulfate (Fig. 1 A) or heparin (Fig. 1 B) with heparanase derived from hepatoma cells resulted in appreciable degradation of both polysaccharides, as shown by gel chromatography. Similar results were obtained with the platelet enzyme (data not shown). Heparin preparations with high or low affinity for antithrombin appeared equally susceptible to cleavage (data not shown). Experiments were undertaken to define the type of glycosidic bond cleaved by the enzymes and to elucidate their substrate recognition properties. Previous experiments demonstrated that platelet heparanase cleaves a single glycosidic bond in a heparin octasaccharide having high affinity for antithrombin (28Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Wasteson Å. Robinson H.C. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10278-10282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel chromatography of the cleavage products along with oligosaccharide standards, obtained by partial deaminative cleavage of heparin, suggested that cleavage had occurred between monosaccharide units 3 and 4from the nonreducing terminus (indicated by the open arrowin Fig. 2), in accord with the postulated β-d-glucuronidase properties of the enzyme. By contrast, a platelet heparanase more recently isolated was claimed to be an α-d-glucosaminidase (26Hoogewerf A.J. Leone J.W. Reardon I.M. Howe W.J. Asa D. Heinrikson R.L. Ledbetter S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3268-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The putative glucosaminidase activity was associated with purified connective tissue-activating peptide-III, which occurs in commercially available “β-thromboglobulin” (a protein 4 amino acid residues shorter than connective tissue-activating peptide-III at the N terminus). Since our previous results (28Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Wasteson Å. Robinson H.C. Ögren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10278-10282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could conceivably have been misinterpreted due to inappropriate selection of oligosaccharide standards, we decided to repeat these experiments using standards obtained by degradation of the authentic octasaccharide (Fig. 2). This species, containing a reducing terminal anhydro-[3H]mannitol unit, was firstN-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis and was then reacted with HNO2 at pH 3.9, yielding a labeled hexasaccharide. The hexasaccharide was further digested with exo-β-d-glucuronidase to produce the pentasaccharide indicated (bottom structure in Fig. 2). The novel hexa- and pentasaccharide standards emerged at distinct elution positions upon gel chromatography (Sephadex G-25) and thus could be used as markers to assess the size of the labeled cleavage product obtained upon incubating the same octasaccharide with heparanase (Fig. 3). The results of such incubations indicate that the octasaccharide is susceptible to cleavage by enzyme from either hepatoma (Fig. 3 A) or platelets (Fig. 3 B). The labeled degradation product emerged on gel chromatography at the same elution position as the standard pentasaccharide derived from the octasaccharide substrate and was clearly separated from the related hexasaccharide species. The octasaccharide thus had been cleaved between residues 3 and4 (see Fig. 2) This finding demonstrates that the endoglycosidase(s) of hepatoma and platelets attacks glucuronidic linkages. Similar results were obtained upon digestion of the octasaccharide with commercially available β-thromboglobulin (Fig. 3 C). The capsular polysaccharide generated by E. coli K5 has the same (-GlcUAβ1,4-GlcNAcα1,4-)n structure as the precursor polymer in heparin/HS biosynthesis. Completed HS chains contain major regions of such sequence that have escaped biosynthetic polymer modification (47Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Incubation of a 3H-labeled K5 polysaccharide preparation, obtained by growing the E. coliK5 strain in the presence of [1-3H]glucose, with hepatoma heparanase did not lead to any appreciable degradation of the polymer (Fig. 4, A and B). By contrast, a sample of 35S-labeled heparan sulfate that was included as an internal control showed a drastic reduction in size (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 4, A andB). The glucuronidic linkages in the native K5 polysaccharide thus were resistant to enzymatic cleavage. Previous studies demonstrated that incubation of K5 polysaccharide with solubilized microsomal enzymes from a heparin-producing mouse mastocytoma, in the presence of the 35S-labeled sulfate donor, PAPS, yielded a labeled polymer that contained the modified disaccharide units typically found in heparin and heparan sulfate (33Kusche M. Hannesson H.H. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Incubation o"

We studied the correlation between Bcl-2 phosphorylation, mitotic arrest, and apoptosis induced by the anti-tubulin agent paclitaxel. Continuous exposure of human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells to 50 ng/ml paclitaxel resulted in mitotic arrest with a symmetrical bell-shaped curve over time. The number of mitotic cells was highest at 24 h (82%), then declined as arrested cells progressed into apoptosis, and barely no mitotic cells were present at 48–60 h. The time curves of paclitaxel-induced cyclin B1 accumulation and stimulation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase activity were identical and superimposable to that of M phase arrest. In contrast, apoptosis was first detected at 12 h and steadily increased thereafter until the termination of the experiments at 48–60 h, when about 80–96% of cells were apoptotic. Bcl-2 phosphorylation was closely associated in time with M phase arrest, accumulation of cyclin B1, and activation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase, but not with apoptosis. At 24 h, when about 82% of the cells were in mitosis, almost all Bcl-2 protein was phosphorylated, whereas at 48 h, when 70–90% of the cells were apoptotic, all Bcl-2 protein was unphosphorylated. Similar results were obtained with SKOV3 cells, indicating that the association of paclitaxel-induced M phase arrest and Bcl-2 phosphorylation is not restricted to HeLa cells. We used short exposure to nocodazole and double thymidine to synchronize HeLa cells and investigate the association of Bcl-2 phosphorylation with mitosis. These studies demonstrated that Bcl-2 phosphorylation occurs in tight association with the number of mitotic cells in experimental conditions that do not lead to apoptosis. However, a continuous exposure to nocodazole resulted in a pattern of Bcl-2 phosphorylation, M phase arrest, and apoptosis similar to that observed with paclitaxel. The phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid was found to inhibit the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Bcl-2 and to delay the progression of nocodazole M phase-arrested cells into interphase. In contrast, the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor staurosporine, but not the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, led to rapid dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Bcl-2 and accelerated the progression of nocodazole M phase-arrested cells into interphase. Immune complex kinase assays in cell-free systems demonstrated that Bcl-2 protein can be a substrate of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase isolated from paclitaxel-treated cells arrested in M phase. Taken together, these studies suggest that Bcl-2 phosphorylation is tightly associated with mitotic arrest and fail to demonstrate that it is a determinant of progression into apoptosis after mitotic arrest induced by anti-tubulin agents.

Taken together, these studies suggest that Bcl-2 phosphorylation is tightly associated with mitotic arrest and fail to demonstrate that it is a determinant of progression into apoptosis after mitotic arrest induced by anti-tubulin agents. Apoptosis is controlled by a complex interplay between regulatory proteins (1Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Bcl-2, a 26-kDa integral membrane oncoprotein, was the first anti-apoptosis gene product discovered (2Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated that overexpression of Bcl-2 protein protects cells from undergoing apoptosis in some cell systems, although a recent report indicates that the level of this oncoprotein is not always correlated with an increased ability of the cell to resist death-promoting stimuli (3Gajewski T.F. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Bcl-2α was first reported by Alnermriet al. (4Alnermri E.S. Robertson N.M Fernandes T.F. Croce C.M. Litwack G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7295-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) in SF9 cells, and its functional implications remain controversial. Haldar et al. (5Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 6Haldar S. Basu A. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 229-233PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that treatment with either okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of phosphatase, or the anti-tubulin agent paclitaxel resulted in Bcl-2 protein phosphorylation and induction of programmed cell death in lymphoid cells, suggesting that Bcl-2 phosphorylation may abrogate its antiapoptotic function. Other studies, however, do not seem to support this hypothesis. May et al. (7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that treatment of murine myeloid factor-dependent FDC-P1/ER cells with interleukin-3 and bryostatin-1, a protein kinase C activator, resulted in the induction of Bcl-2α protein hyperphosphorylation and prevention of apoptosis, indicating that Bcl-2 protein phosphorylation may not be associated with loss of function. Paclitaxel is an effective agent in the treatment of breast, ovarian, lung, and head and neck cancers (8Rowinsky E.K. Cazenave L.A. Donehower R.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Paclitaxel promotes tubulin polymerization, thus altering the dynamic equilibrium of assembling and disassembling of microtubules and causing mitotic arrest of dividing cells (9Manfredi J.J. Horwitz S.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1984; 25: 83-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms of paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis have not been elucidated. Recently, several studies have suggested that paclitaxel-induced apoptosis may be mediated by loss of Bcl-2 function as a result of phosphorylation by activated Raf-1 kinase (10Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T.W. Nguyen P. Mimnaugh E.G. Trepel J. Neckers L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4623-4626PubMed Google Scholar, 11Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T.W. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies, however, have not confirmed this observation. Ibrado et al. (13Ibrado A.M. Liu L. Bhalla K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1109-1115PubMed Google Scholar) reported that paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells was not associated with activation of Raf-1 kinase and Bcl-2 phosphorylation (13Ibrado A.M. Liu L. Bhalla K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1109-1115PubMed Google Scholar). These controversial findings prompted us to study more in detail the relationship between paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation and apoptosis in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma cells. The results presented here indicate that hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2 is temporally associated with paclitaxel-induced M phase arrest but not with apoptosis. Results with HeLa cells synchronized by either nocodazole or double thymidine blockade confirmed that the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 is a marker of M phase events and failed to demonstrate a direct linkage between Bcl-2 phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis. Additional studies with inhibitors of phosphatase and kinase in nocodazole-blocked M phase cells further confirmed that the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 is tightly linked to the regulation of M phase events. Paclitaxel, nocodazole, and thymidine were purchased from Sigma. Okadaic acid, staurosporine, genistein, and histone H1 were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Cell culture medium was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 (Ab-1) antibody, anti-Cdc2 (Ab-1), and anti-cyclin B1 (Ab-2) were purchased from Calbiochem. Polyclonal anti-Raf-1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). HeLa and SKOV3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 250 mml-glutamine. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. Exponentially growing cells were exposed to paclitaxel at the indicated concentrations for different lengths of time. Tissue culture samples were taken at the indicated times, and cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis or for kinase assay. For cell synchronization at metaphase, HeLa cells (5 × 106 cells/25-cm2 flask) were exposed to 100 ng/ml nocodazole at 37 °C for 16 h. After treatment, metaphase cells were collected by the gentle shakeoff method and washed three times with fresh medium. For relieving cells from M phase arrest, cells (1 × 106) were replated in a 60 × 15-mm dish and incubated at 37 °C in fresh medium for different times. For G1/S phase synchronization, cells (1 × 106 cells in 60 × 15-mm dishes) were treated with thymidine (two 16-h periods of exposure to 2 mm thymidine separated by a 10-h exposure without thymidine) as described previously (14Ling Y.H. El-Naggar A.K. Priebe W. Perez-Soler R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 832-841PubMed Google Scholar). At the indicated time points after release, cells were washed once with cold Ca2+, Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −90 °C until use. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 250 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The protein amount in each sample was determined by a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of lysate were subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween buffer at room temperature for 1 h, Bcl-2, Cdc2, and cyclin B1 were probed with monoclonal anti-Bcl-2, anti-Cdc2, or anti-cyclin B1 antibodies. The immunoblots were analyzed using an ECL detection system according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative amounts of Cdc2, cyclin B1, and phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Bcl-2 protein were quantitatively measured by laser scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells (1 × 106 cells) were aliquoted from the cultures at the indicated time points and solubilized in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100. After incubation at 4 °C for 15 min, the lysate was separated by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein content in each sample was determined as described above using a DC protein assay kit and adjusted accordingly before the assay. Lysate (0.5 ml) was incubated with 5 μg monoclonal anti-Cdc2 and anti-cyclin B1 antibodies and 50 μl of protein A/protein G conjugated agarose (Calbiochem) at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times with lysis buffer and once with reaction buffer, the immunoprecipitate complex was collected and incubated at 30 °C in 50 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH, 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.5 mg/ml of histone H1 for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 4× Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The 32P-phosphorylated histone H1 was separated by 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gel, and determined either by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat film or by liquid scintillation counting. To assay Bcl-2 phosphorylation by Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase, Bcl-2 and Cdc2/cyclin B1 were immunoprecipitated from 1 × 107HeLa cells by monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 and anti-Cdc2/anti-cyclin B1 antibodies as described above. The reaction of Bcl-2 phosphorylation was carried out in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH, 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and Bcl-2 and Cdc2/cyclin B1 immune complex. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 4× Laemmli's sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, the samples were subjected to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane and probed with monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibody with ECL detection as described above. The 32P-incorporated Bcl-2 protein was analyzed by autoradiography. The number of mitotic cells was determined in cells stained with Wright-Giemsa dye solution. Apoptotic cells were detected using a Tunel 1The abbreviation used is: Tunel, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling. reaction kit according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Boehringer Mannheim). After the reaction, the fluorescence-labeled cells were determined by flow cytometry (Epics Profile Analyzer, Coulter Co., Miami, FL). For determination of paclitaxel-induced DNA fragmentation, cells were solubilized with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH, 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant fraction was collected and fragmented DNA was precipitated with 100 mm NaCl and equal volume isopropanol at −20 °C overnight. DNA was dissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer containing 20 units of RNase and incubated at 60 °C for 60 min. After electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel, DNA was stained with ethidium bromide, and resulting DNA fragmentation was visualized by UV illumination (15Ling Y.H. Priebe W. Perez-Soler R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1845-1852PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, we treated HeLa cells continuously with 50 ng/ml paclitaxel (a concentration that corresponds to the ID90) and determined drug-induced M phase arrest by using Wright-Giemsa dye staining. About 2% cells were in M phase at baseline. Paclitaxel treatment resulted in a steady increase of cells arrested at M phase which was maximum at 24 h and decreased thereafter, i.e. 82% in M phase at 24 h and barely no cells in M phase at 48–60 h. Because M phase is associated with accumulation of B type cyclins and activation of Cdc2/cyclin B complex kinase (16Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 17King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of paclitaxel on the levels of Cdc2 and cyclin B1 and activity of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase. Similar to M phase arrest, paclitaxel treatment caused a gradual increase in cyclin B1 amounts that peaked at 24 h and markedly decreased at 48–60 h. Under the same experimental conditions, the Cdc2 levels were relatively constant. As expected, the time-course of drug-induced stimulation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase activity was similar to those of drug-induced M phase arrest and induction of cyclin B1 (Fig. 1). In summary, paclitaxel-induced M phase arrest, accumulation of cyclin B1, and stimulation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase exhibited a bell shape time-course with the peak of the curve at 24 h. Next, we determined the effect of paclitaxel in inducing apoptosis in HeLa cells. Drug treatment was the same as described above. Aliquots of cells were taken at different time points and apoptotic cells determined by morphology and Tunel reaction assay. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, no apoptotic cells were observed at 6 h; about 8–18% of cells were apoptotic by 12–24 h. The number of apoptotic cells markedly increased after 24 h, with 60–80% apoptotic cells at 36–48 h and 96% at 60 h. To confirm that drug-induced cell death was due to apoptosis, DNA obtained from cells at different time points was subjected to a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by UV illumination. As shown in Fig. 2 C, a typical apoptotic hallmark, cleavage of genomic DNA into multiple internucleosome (∼200 base pairs), appeared at 24 h, and the extent of DNA fragmentation increased with time. These data further confirm our previous findings in KB and SKOV3 cells that paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest precedes apoptosis (18Ling Y.H. Consoli U. Tornos C. Andreeff M. Perez-Soler R. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and are consistent with the report by Jordan et al. (19Jordan M.A. Wendell K. Gardiner S. Derry W.B. Coppy H. Wilson L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we determined whether paclitaxel-induced apoptosis is associated with Bcl-2 phosphorylation. We treated cells continuously with 50 ng/ml paclitaxel, collected cell aliquots from culture at the indicated time-points, and lysed cells with lysis buffer. An equal amount of lysate (50 μg protein) from each sample was subjected to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Bcl-2 protein was probed by monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibody with ECL detection. The results presented in Fig. 3 A, a typical and reproducible Western blot analysis, revealed that paclitaxel treatment for 12 h clearly altered the Bcl-2 electrophoretical mobility pattern, resulting in two bands, one corresponding to the 26 kDa unphosphorylated Bcl-2 and another to the slower mobility phosphorylated Bcl-2 protein. At 24 h, two slower Bcl-2 bands appeared, whereas the 26 kDa Bcl-2 band had almost completely disappeared, indicating that most Bcl-2 protein had been subjected to phosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation. At 36 h, the 26 kDa of Bcl-2 again became predominant, but two slower bands still could be seen. However, at 48–60 h, the slower bands corresponding to the hyperphosphorylated and phosphorylated Bcl-2 had completely disappeared, and only the 26-kDa Bcl-2 protein band could be seen. We used a laser scanning densitometer to quantitatively measure the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Bcl-2 protein bands and found that paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation exhibited a good correlation with drug-induced M phase arrest (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, as presented in Fig. 4, we conclude that paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation is associated in time with M phase arrest and activation of Cdc2/cyclin B kinase, thus preceding apoptosis, and that at the time of massive apoptosis the Bcl-2 protein is fully unphosphorylated (Fig. 4).Figure 4Time course studies of paclitaxel-induced M phase arrest, Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase activity, Bcl-2 protein phosphorylation, and apoptosis in HeLa cells. Cells were continuously exposed to 50 ng/ml paclitaxel. Drug-induced M phase arrest, Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase, Bcl-2 phosphorylation, and apoptosis were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation is associated with mitosis in a different cell line, we treated human ovarian carcinoma SKOV3 cells continuously with 50 ng/ml paclitaxel and determined Bcl-2 phosphorylation, mitosis and apoptosis at different time points. As shown in Fig. 5, the patterns of paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation, M phase arrest and apoptosis in SKOV3 cells are similar to those in HeLa cells described above. Thus it indicates that the association of drug-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation with M phase arrest, not with apoptosis is not restricted to HeLa cells. To further confirm that Bcl-2 protein phosphorylation is associated with M phase arrest, we used synchronized HeLa cells to determine Bcl-2 phosphorylation at different phases of the cell cycle. First, we treated cells with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h and collected M phase blocked cells as described in Materials and Methods. After washing three times with fresh medium, cells were replated and incubated in fresh medium. The number of mitotic cells and the amount of phosphorylated Bcl-2 protein were determined at different time-points after release as described above. As shown in Fig. 6 A, about 91% of cells were in M phase at time 0 and about 86% at 1 h post-release. The number of mitotic cells decreased to 44% at 2 h post-release and to 3–7% cells at 3–5 h, indicating that most cells had been relieved from nocodazole-blocked M phase and had progressed into interphase by 3 h of release. Western blot analysis revealed that, from time 0 to 1 h after release, the Bcl-2 protein exhibited two slower bands corresponding to hyperphosphorylated and phosphorylated protein, with no dephosphorylated protein band. In contrast, 2 h after release, when 56% of cells had exited M phase, about 50% of Bcl-2 protein was dephosphorylated. After 3–5 h of release, almost all cells were in interphase and only a 26-kDa dephosphorylated band was displayed in the gel. We also determined the apoptotic cells at different time points after release and only found a few apoptotic cells (<10%) up to 48 h after release. To compare side by side the effects of nocodazole and paclitaxel under the same experimental conditions, we treated HeLa cells with 50 ng/ml paclitaxel for 16 h and collected the M phase cells as described above. Cell aliquots were collected at different times after drug incubation. The number of mitotic and apoptotic cells and the extent of Bcl-2 phosphorylation were determined as described above. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the M phase blockade caused by paclitaxel was very slowly reversible. For example, about 90% cells were in mitosis during the first 6 h post-incubation, decreasing to 80–60% at 12–24 h post-incubation. Again, the extent of Bcl-2 phosphorylation was tightly associated with the number of mitotic cells, i.e. about 90% of Bcl-2 protein was phosphorylated during the first 6 h post-incubation, decreasing to 80–50% at 12–24 h. In contrast, only 3–5% cells were in mitosis and there was no detectable phosphorylated Bcl-2 24 h after a 16 h exposure to nocodazole. In addition, the persistence of mitotic arrest and phosphorylated Bcl-2 in paclitaxel-treated cells was associated with massive (>80%) apoptosis at 48 h post-incubation versus <5% after nocodazole. Finally, because a 16 h exposure to nocodazole only caused a rapidly and completely reversible M phase arrest and minimal apoptosis, we investigated whether a continuous exposure to 100 ng/ml nocodazole could induce apoptosis in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 7, continuous exposure to nocodazole caused a more prolonged M phase arrest and Bcl-2 phosphorylation than a 16 h exposure, and resulted in massive (>80%) apoptosis at 60 h, with a pattern very similar to that observed in cells continuously exposed to paclitaxel (Fig. 4). Altogether, these results confirm a tight temporal association between Bcl-2 phosphorylation and M phase arrest, and indicate that with either agent apoptosis is only induced under experimental conditions that result in prolonged mitotic arrest and Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Next, we used double thymidine to synchronize HeLa cells and determined the presence of phosphorylated Bcl-2 at different phases of the cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 8, about 70% of cells were synchronized at G1 phase after double thymidine block (two periods of exposure with a 10-h interval of incubation in normal medium). Accumulation of cells at G2/M was started to be observed at 6 h post-block release, peaked (about 60% G2/M cells) at 10 h, and still remained significant (about 40% G2/M cells) at 12 h. Interestingly, Western blot analysis revealed that the slower mobility band, representing phosphorylated Bcl-2 protein, appeared at 6 h after release and lasted until 12 h after release. The phosphorylated band disappeared at 24 h, when 80% of cells were in G1 phase and only 8% of cells in G2/M phase. These results further confirm that Bcl-2 protein phosphorylation is associated with cells at G2/M phase. Although the function of phosphorylated Bcl-2 and the sites of phosphorylation on the Bcl-2 protein remain to be defined, it has been speculated that serine/threonine kinases and phosphatases may be involved in the regulation of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein (20Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). To further study the association between Bcl-2 phosphorylation and mitosis, we used inhibitors of phosphatase and protein kinase to examine whether the alteration in Bcl-2 phosphorylation by these inhibitors could alter the exit of cells from mitosis. First, we synchronized HeLa cells in M phase with nocodazole and then replated the M phase cells in fresh medium in the absence or presence of 1 μm okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor. After incubation for the indicated periods of time, cell aliquots were taken from the culture, and the number of mitotic cells and extent of Bcl-2 phosphorylation were determined as described above. As shown in Fig. 9 A, treatment with okadaic acid prevented or delayed the exit of the cells from mitosis and the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Bcl-2. For example, 69% cells remained in M phase and the hyperphosphorylated or phosphorylated Bcl-2 bands were still predominant at 4–6 h post-release in the presence of okadaic acid, versus only 4–9% cells and barely no phosphorylated Bcl-2 bands in the absence of inhibitor. Next, we used staurosporine, a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, to examine whether the inhibition of Bcl-2 phosphorylation could facilitate the exit of cells from mitosis and entry into interphase. Cells arrested at M phase after exposure to 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h were used for these experiments. As shown in Fig. 9 B, treatment of cells arrested at M phase by nocodazole with 100 nm staurosporine for 60 min resulted in a massive entry of mitotic cells into interphase, whereas 80% cells remained in M phase in the absence of staurosporine. As expected, the presence of staurosporine for 60 min resulted in complete dephosphorylation of the Bcl-2 protein, whereas the Bcl-2 protein remained at the hyperphosphorylation state in the absence of inhibitor. Finally, we used genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to determine the effect of this inhibitor on cell entry into interphase and Bcl-2 dephosphorylation. Genistein did not alter the number of mitotic cells nor the extent of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in cells treated with 25 μm genistein for 90 min after release (Fig. 9 C). These findings suggest that serine/threonine kinases, but not tyrosine kinases, are involved in the regulation of Bcl-2 phosphorylation and M phase transition. These results are consistent with those reported by Chen and Faller (21Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because Bcl-2 phosphorylation is temporally associated with activation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase, we investigated the potential role of Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex kinase in phosphorylating Bcl-2. To determine whether Bcl-2 phosphorylation may be associated with activation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase, we used monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibody to immunoprecipitate Bcl-2 protein from HeLa cells. Equal amounts of Bcl-2 detected with ECL were added to a reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex immunoprecipitated from untreated and paclitaxel-treated cells. The paclitaxel-induced stimulation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase activity was determined by using histone H1 as a substrate as described above. As shown in Fig. 10, the Bcl-2 protein immunoprecipitated from untreated cells was markedly phosphorylated by the Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase complex precipitated from paclitaxel-treated cells, although the extent of such phosphorylation was lower than that using histone H1 as a substrate. In contrast, no Bcl-2 protein was phosphorylated by the Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase complex precipitated from untreated cells. Under the same experimental conditions, other cell cycle related kinases precipitated from paclitaxel-treated cells, such as Cdc2/cyclin A and Cdk2/cyclin E, failed to phosphorylate Bcl-2 protein, indicating that phosphorylation of Bcl-2 may be at least in part associated with the activation of M phase-related kinase (data not shown). The results of the present study demonstrate that the anti-tubulin agents paclitaxel and nocodazole induce transient Bcl-2 phosphorylation in close association with mitotic arrest and cyclin B1 kinase activation. Bcl-2 phosphorylation of variable duration was observed in HeLa cells synchronized with double thymidine when they reach G2/M phase, HeLa cells transiently arrested in mitosis by nocodazole, and HeLa cells arrested in mitosis prior to apoptosis after continuous exposure to paclitaxel and nocodazole. The duration of Bcl-2 phosphorylation was about 3–6 h in cells synchronized with double thymidine or transiently arrested in mitosis after a 16-h exposure to nocodazole. In both cases, no apoptosis was observed. In contrast, Bcl-2 phosphorylation lasted >24 h in cells continuously exposed to paclitaxel and nocodazole and in these situations massive apoptosis was observed 24–36 h after maximum mitotic arrest. However, at the time of massive apoptosis all Bcl-2 was dephosphorylated. Altogether, these results do not appear to support the recently stated hypothesis that inactivation of Bcl-2 by phosphorylation is a major potential mechanism of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (4Alnermri E.S. Robertson N.M Fernandes T.F. Croce C.M. Litwack G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7295-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 7May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar). If Bcl-2 phosphorylation was a major determinant of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, one would have expected to observe a similar apoptotic effect in nocodazole-synchronized mitotic cells in which >90% of Bcl-2 protein was phosphorylated. However, we can not rule out nor prove from our studies that it is not Bcl-2 phosphorylation per se but a persistent (>24 h) Bcl-2 inactivation through phosphorylation the important determinant of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Another possible explanation for the discrepant conclusions between ours and previous studies may be related to the time frame of the experiments, 24 h in previous studies as opposed to 48–60 h in our study. If our studies had not included determinations at 48–60 h, we would have not been able to demonstrate that paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation peaks at 24 h, as well as other markers of mitotic arrest such as accumulation of cyclin B1 and activation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase, and that all the mitotic markers are completely reversed by 48–60 h, when massive apoptosis is paramount (Fig. 3). Interestingly, our results are consistent with the recent report by Ibrado et al. (13Ibrado A.M. Liu L. Bhalla K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1109-1115PubMed Google Scholar) in HL-60 human leukemia cells demonstrating complete dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 at the time of paclitaxel-induced DNA degradation. The fact that Bcl-2 is dephosphorylated at the time of massive apoptosis does not rule out in principle the possibility that a preceding Bcl-2 phosphorylation lasting more than a certain critical period of time might be sufficient to trigger the apoptotic pathway. However, the proposed mechanism of loss of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic activity appears to be mediated by a decreased ability of the phosphorylated protein to interact with proapoptotic proteins such as bax, in which case one would expect a persistently phosphorylated and non-functional Bcl-2 protein at the time of paclitaxel-induced massive apoptosis (22Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (,): 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 23Hunter J.J. Parslow T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8521-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in mitotic cells has not been fully elucidated. There is evidence that Raf-1 can phosphorylate the Bcl-2 protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane (24Wang H.G. Miyashita T. Takayama S. Sato T. Torigoe S. Krajewshki S. Tanaka S. Hovey III, L. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2751-2756PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wang H.G. Takayama S. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1851-1854PubMed Google Scholar) reported that paclitaxel-induced apoptosis was associated with the activation of Raf-1 kinase and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in MCF-7 cells. However, some investigators have shown that depletion of Raf-1 kinase activity by the specific inhibitor geldanamycin did not affect paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation and apoptosis (13Ibrado A.M. Liu L. Bhalla K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1109-1115PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate whether Raf-1 is responsible for phosphorylating Bcl-2 in mitotic cells, we used the Jurkat cells and the mutant cells J.CaM.1, which are deficient in Lck gene and lack Raf-1 kinase activation in M phase (26Pathan N.I. Ashendel C.L. Geahlen R.L. Harrison M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30315-30371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our preliminary results indicate that the pattern of Bcl-2 phosphorylation induced by paclitaxel in Jurkat cells is similar to that in J.CaM.1 cells, thus suggesting that Raf-1 kinase may not be involved in paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation (data not shown). Another possibility would be that Bcl-2 is phosphorylated by Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase since Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase activation and Bcl-2 phosphorylation occur at the same time. It is well known that several proteins are phosphorylated in M phase by Cdc2/cyclin B kinase, and that these phosphorylated proteins play crucial roles in regulating the mitotic process, including chromatin condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and formation of the mitotic spindle. We were able to demonstrate using immune complex kinase assays in cell free systems that in fact the Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex can phosphorylate Bcl-2, although the extent of phosphorylation was lower than with histone H1 as a substrate (Fig. 10). It remains to be determined whether this is also the case in whole cell systems since the Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex is located in the nucleus and the Bcl-2 protein in the mitochondrial membrane. However, in favor of the possibility that Bcl-2 may be phosphorylated by Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase is the observation by Luet al. that the subcellular distribution of Bcl-2 protein determined by either immunocytochemistry or immunoelectron microscopy was dependent on cell cycle, i.e. Bcl-2 protein was localized in the cytoplasm at interphase and in the nucleus, in particular in chromosomes, at M phase (27Lu Q.L. Hanby A.M. Nasser Hajibagheri M.A. Gschmeissner S.E. Lu P.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Wright N.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 363-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that a phosphorylated Bcl-2 protein is a landmark of mitotic cells. Like in the case of M phase-related cyclins and kinases, it is reasonable to assume that Bcl-2 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation may play an important role in regulating M phase specific events, such as facilitation of mitotic-related kinase into nuclei, breaking down of nuclear envelope, condensation of chromatin, formation of the mitotic spindle, or chromosome segregation, and determining the progression of cells from G2 into mitosis and from mitosis into interphase, respectively. The elucidation of the mechanisms by which Bcl-2 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation affect cell cycle progression deserves, therefore, further investigation. In our studies, Bcl-2 phosphorylation was found to be regulated by unidentified phosphatases and serine/threonine kinase since treatment with either okadaic acid or staurosporine strikingly altered Bcl-2 phosphorylation and delayed or enhanced, respectively, exit from mitosis and entry into interphase. The observation that kinase and phosphatase inhibitors may disrupt the equilibrium between Bcl-2 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and impair the normal progression of the cell cycle in mitosis could provide a therapeutic opportunity and be exploited to potentiate the effects of paclitaxel or other chemotherapeutic agents."

In addition to causing proliferation, HGF/SF will also cause normal epithelial cells grown on tissue culture plastic to “scatter,” showing an increase in motility and reduction in cell-cell interaction that leads to the cells growing as a dispersed culture rather than in confluent islands (1Stoker M.

The effects of HGF/SF are mediated through its cell surface receptor, a tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-met proto-oncogene (7Naldini L. Vigna E. Narsimhan R.P. Gaudino G. Zarnegar R.

In recent years, considerable advances have been made in understanding the signaling pathways triggered by ligand activation of Met. The receptor autophosphorylates at two carboxyl-terminal tyrosines, Tyr1349 and Tyr1356 (9Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M.

Both sites are capable of binding the Src homology 2 domains of p85 (the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase)), pp60c-src, phospholipase C-γ, and Shc; in addition, Tyr1356 can bind to the Src homology 2 domain of Grb2 (10Ponzetto C.

Although the immediate effects of HGF/SF on intracellular signaling pathways are well characterized, the mechanisms involved in longer term responses, such as scattering and tubulogenesis, are less well understood. In the case of scattering in the dog kidney epithelial cell line MDCK, it has been shown that normal function of Ras is absolutely necessary for HGF/SF-induced motility (14Hartmann G. Weidner K.M. Schwarz H. Birchmeier W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21936-21939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of activated Ras in MDCK cells causes a scattered appearance (14Hartmann G. Weidner K.M. Schwarz H. Birchmeier W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21936-21939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schoenenberger C.-A. Zuk A. Kendall D. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 873-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although microinjection of activated Ras protein induces only the early stages of the scattering response, cell spreading and actin rearrangement (15Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the function of the Ras-related GTPase Rac inhibits HGF/SF-induced scattering, although microinjection of activated Rac itself does not induce this response (15Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated Rho protein inhibits HGF/SF-induced scattering (15Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin also inhibits HGF/SF-induced scattering (17Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that Ras, PI 3-kinase, and Rac all play essential roles in scattering; a signaling pathway connecting these three proteins has recently been described (18Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). However, it is probable that other pathways will be involved in this protracted and complex response. In particular, modulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions is important (19Clark P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1265-1275PubMed Google Scholar), possibly involving HGF/SF-induced phosphorylation of β-catenin and plakoglobin (20Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Takeichi M. Ito F. Cell. Adhes. Commun. 1994; 4: 295-305Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar). HGF/SF promotion of tubulogenesis is a yet longer term response, about which less is known. Tyrosine 1356 of Met has been shown to be required for tubulogenesis, whereas it is not essential for scattering (21Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22211-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, Gab1, a novel adaptor protein related to IRS-1, has been described (22Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar); it has been reported that this interacts specifically with Met and that this interaction correlates with induction of branching tubulogenesis by HGF/SF (23Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Tyrosine 1356 is required for Gab1 association with Met (24Rubio I. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Downward J. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Tpr-Met-induced transformation also correlates with Gab1 binding to this site (25Vanhaesebroeck B. Welham M.J. Kotani K. Stein R. Warne P.H. Zvelebil M.J. Higashi K. Volinia S. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4330-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). At present, the precise early signaling pathways involved in the induction of tubulogenesis in response to HGF/SF are not clear; however, it is probable that the time course of these signals will be very important in this long term change in cell behavior. As is the case with scattering, modulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction is also likely to be critical in this response (26Saelman E.U.M. Keely P.J. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3531-3540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we have set out to study the role of signaling pathways controlled by Ras in the scattering and tubulogenesis responses of MDCK cells to HGF/SF. Ras is known to control several signaling pathways, including the Raf/MAP kinase pathway, PI 3-kinase, and Ral GDP dissociation stimulator, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Ras-related protein Ral (27Marshall C.J. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Partial loss of function mutants of Ras have been described that activate a known subset of these pathways (18Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar,28White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Vanaelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 29Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Using these mutants and also activated versions of Ras effectors such as Raf and PI 3-kinase, we show that expression of activated Ras or PI 3-kinase, but not of Raf, is sufficient to induce scattering. Scattering in response to Ras, PI 3-kinase, or HGF/SF is sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of either the MAP kinase kinase MEK or of PI 3-kinase. This suggests that activation of PI 3-kinase can induce scattering dependent on basal MAP kinase function. In the case of tubulogenesis, cells expressing activated Ras or Raf fail to form tubules but grow in a disorganized manner, whereas cells expressing activated PI 3-kinase form tubules constitutively. Tubulogenesis in response to both HGF/SF and expression of activated PI 3-kinase is inhibited by MEK inhibitor, again suggesting that basal function of this pathway is required in addition to PI 3-kinase activity. In addition to Ras, we also studied the involvement of R-Ras in HGF/SF-induced events. R-Ras is a ubiquitously expressed protein with transforming potential (30Huff S.Y. Quilliam L.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); it is 55% identical to Ras at the amino acid level and interacts with many of the same downstream target proteins, activating PI 3-kinase but not Raf (31Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennström S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated R-Ras constitutively induces both scattering and tubulogenesis, suggesting the possibility that this protein may be an important component of the normal cellular response to HGF/SF. The Ras and R-Ras expression vectors were generated as described in Ref. 31Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennström S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Activated PI 3-kinase constructs were made by the addition of a carboxyl-terminal farnesylation signal from H-Ras to p110 to cause its membrane localization (Myc-tagged p110-CAAX in pcDNA3). 2S. Wennström and J. Downward, manuscript in preparation. Raf-CAAX cDNA were provided by R. Marais and C. J. Marshall (Institute of Cancer Research, London). Gag-PKB and hemagglutinin-tagged PKB cDNAs were provided by B. Burgering and P. Coffer (University of Utrecht). Early passage MDCK cells were provided by J. Taylor-Papadimitriou (Imperial Cancer Research Fund) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. To generate stably transfected lines, wild type cells were transfected with the various constructs by lipofection (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated at 105 cells/well of a six-well plate and transfected the following day with 4 μg of DNA (plus 0.4 μg of a hygromycin resistance plasmid for those vectors not encoding a neomycin resistance gene) and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE/well. After 48 h, cells were replated into a 10-cm dish and selected with 250 μg/ml hygromycin or 500 μg/ml G418 as appropriate. Control cells were transfected with empty vector alone or were left untransfected. After selection in antibiotic for 10–14 days, individual resistant colonies were picked and expanded. At least 24 clones were picked for each transfection, and expression of protein was assessed by Western blotting of cell lysates using appropriate antibodies. Expression of V12 H-Ras and the Ras mutant proteins (C40 and G37) varied between 5-fold and 10-fold excess over endogenous Ras levels. Gag-PKB protein levels were 3–5-fold greater than endogenous Akt/PKB levels. Clones expressing Raf-CAAX, p110*, V38R-Ras, and V14Rho were identified by Western blotting using an epitope tag antibody (anti-Myc, clone 9E10). Akt/PKB kinase activity in the clones expressed as fold increase over wild type cells growing under basal conditions were as follows: V12Ras, 10–16-fold; Raf-CAAX, 0.6–1.5-fold; p110*, 5–7-fold; V12C40Ras, 4.4–9.6-fold; gag-PKB, 9–12-fold; V38R-Ras, 3.4–7-fold; V12G37Ras, 0.7–1.3-fold. ERK activity was increased 4–7-fold in V12Ras clones and 7–20-fold in Raf-CAAX clones and was basal in all of the others. Over this range of overexpression of signaling proteins, there was no clear dose-response relationship with respect to the scattering and cytoskeletal rearrangement phenotype. MDCK were seeded at 104 cells/well of a 24-well plate on glass coverslips in DMEM, 10% FBS 48 h before the assay. Cells were pretreated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (20 μm) (Biomol) or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (30 μm) (Calbiochem) as indicated for 30 min in DMEM + 2 mg/ml BSA (fatty acid-free, Sigma) prior to the addition of EGF (20 ng/ml, Sigma) or recombinant human HGF/SF (10 ng/ml, Sigma). For phase-contrast, cells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (30 min at room temperature) and stored at 4 °C under PBS. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, coverslips were incubated in PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After three washes in 1.5% BSA/PBS, cells were incubated in tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Sigma) for 60 min at 37 °C, washed six times in PBS, and mounted. Coverslips were examined by confocal microscopy. Staining was performed essentially as for actin staining, except that β-catenin monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, C19220) was used instead of phalloidin at a dilution of 1:200 in 1.5% BSA/PBS for 20 min at 20 °C, followed by washing once with 1.5% BSA/PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and twice with 1.5% BSA/PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Secondary antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse IgG (The Jackson Laboratory, 115-095-100) at a dilution of 1:200 in 1.5% BSA/PBS for 20 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by three washes in 1.5% BSA/PBS for 5 min each. Coverslips were mounted and examined by confocal microscopy. Cells were plated at 105 cells/well of a six-well plate and transfected the following day with 4 μg of hemagglutinin-tagged PKB/Akt DNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE/well in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6 h. 1 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS was added, and cells were incubated overnight. After removal of the transfection medium, cells were starved in DMEM, 0.2% FBS for 18–24 h prior to assay. After stimulation with growth factors, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin/pepstatin/leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged at 13000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of anti-hemagglutinin antibody (12CA5) for 2 h and then with protein G-agarose for 1 h. Pellets were washed twice in wash buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA), once in high salt buffer (0.5m LiCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, 1 mmEDTA), and once in kinase buffer wash (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2). The pellet was resuspended in a kinase mixture consisting of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol), 2.5 μg histone H2B (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 μm protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma), 50 μmATP, and 3 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); after 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, the lower part of the membrane was analyzed for H2B phosphorylation and quantified by PhosphorImager Analysis (Molecular Dynamics). The upper part of the membrane was probed with polyclonal anti-PKB/Akt antibody (kindly provided by Dr. B. Burgering, Utrecht, Netherlands) and quantified using ECF/Storm imaging (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Molecular Dynamics). The H2B phosphorylation was then corrected for hemagglutinin-PKB/Akt expression. Cells were plated at 2 × 105cells/well of a six-well plate in DMEM, 10% FBS. Medium was replaced the following day with DMEM, 2 mg/ml BSA, and cells were starved for 18–24 h. Following growth factor stimulation, cells were lysed as described above, and ERK 2 was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody (provided by C. Marshall) and protein A-agarose. Lysates were washed twice with wash buffer and once with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2). Kinase assay was carried out in kinase buffer plus 2.5 μg MBP, 10 μm ATP, and 2 μCi [γ32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Collagen (Collagen Corp., Palo Alto, CA) solution was mixed with 10× DMEM and sterile water to a final collagen concentration of 2 mg/ml and neutralized with NaOH on ice. 0.7 ml/35-mm dish was allowed to gel at 37 °C. MDCK cells were harvested using trypsin/EDTA and plated at 5 × 103/well in a further 1 ml of collagen solution on top of the previously gelled collagen layer. After 15 min at 37 °C to allow the solution to gel, 1 ml of complete medium (DMEM, 10% FBS) was added. When indicated, this was supplemented with HGF/SF (20 ng/ml), and the medium was changed every 2–3 days. Cultures were routinely photographed at 7–10 days or as indicated. MDCK cells undergo a scattering response when stimulated with HGF/SF (1Stoker M. Gherardi E. Perryman M. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) but show weak scattering in response to EGF. Scattering has been shown to involve signaling pathways, including Ras, Shc, and PI 3-kinase (9Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14119-14123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), all of which are activated in response to both HGF/SF and EGF. It is possible, however, that the kinetics of activation of Ras and PI 3-kinase pathways may modify the motogenic response. There is precedence for such a situation in PC12 cells, which respond to EGF by proliferation and to NGF by differentiation, depending on the kinetics of activation of the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway. Fig. 1 A confirms the effects of HGF/SF and EGF on MDCK motility. In order to evaluate activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway, we measured PKB/Akt kinase activation in response to EGF and HGF/SF. Fig. 1 B shows that the activation of PKB/Akt by EGF was transient: it peaked at 5 min (3.9-fold increase over basal activity) and returned to baseline by 30 min. In contrast, the activation by HGF/SF was protracted, with a slower onset (1.85-fold increase at 5 min; peak, 3.83-fold at 120 min) and kinase activity that was still elevated (2.28-fold) 6 h after the addition of HGF/SF. The activation of ERK2 by EGF showed a peak at 5–15 min (3.1-fold over basal) and a steady decline in activity to reach a basal level by 2–3 h. In response to HGF/SF, there was again a slower onset of action (peak 4-fold at 15 min) and more prolonged activation with significantly elevated activity at 4 h (2.86-fold). Therefore, the kinetics of activation of both the PI 3-kinase and ERK pathways are markedly different in response to HGF/SF compared with EGF, with HGF/SF stimulation resulting in prolonged activation of both signaling pathways. It has been shown previously that inhibition of PI 3-kinase reduces HGF/SF-induced scattering (17Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 will prevent scattering in response to HGF/SF (Fig. 2). We also utilized the MEK inhibitor PD98059 to examine the role of the MAP kinase pathway in scattering. When used at a concentration that blocks HGF/SF-induced ERK activation completely, PD98059 prevented cell scattering. A comparison of the effects of LY294002 and PD98059 on HGF/SF-induced changes in the actin cytoskeleton was also carried out. HGF/SF treatment led to a reduction in the number of actin stress fibers, a breakdown in cell-cell contacts, and dispersion of colonies. Cells pretreated with LY294002 still showed the HGF/SF-induced reduction in stress fibers and some loss of cell-cell contacts within the colony, but the cells did not disperse. In contrast, pretreatment with PD98059 maintained, or even increased, stress fibers, and there was no loss of cell-cell contact. Therefore, although the net result of the inhibitors on scattering is similar, it appears likely that this is brought about in different ways. The breakdown of cell-cell contacts and the increase in cell motility may be regulated separately by the Raf/MEK/MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase dependent pathways. Activated Ras can influence both pathways, although the relative contribution of endogenous Ras to PI 3-kinase activation varies between cell type and stimulus (33Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H.

Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that MDCK cells expressing constitutively activated Ras have an altered morphological appearance with increased membrane ruffling and extended cell processes (16Schoenenberger C.-A. Zuk A. Kendall D. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 873-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast to parental cells, they do not form discrete colonies at low cell densities but have a more dispersed appearance, with reduced cell-cell contacts. In order to investigate which of the signaling pathways controlled by Ras may be responsible for this phenotype, we utilized activated versions of various proteins known to lie downstream of Ras. Wild type MDCK cells were transfected with constructs expressing activated forms of H-Ras (V12 Ras), Raf (Raf-CAAX), and PI 3-kinase (p110*) and with partial loss of function mutant Ras proteins that distinguish between the various effector pathways downstream of Ras: V12S35 Ras selectively activates the Raf pathway, V12C40 Ras selectively activates the PI 3-kinase pathway, and V12G37 Ras selectively activates the Ral GDP dissociation stimulator pathway (18Rodriguez-Viciana P.

In addition, cells were transfected with the activated Ras-related protein R-Ras (V38 R-Ras) and with activated RhoA (V14 Rho). Fig. 3 A shows phase-contrast morphology of wild type MDCK and of clones stably expressing the various constructs. The morphological appearances shown are representative of at least four separate clones expressing the same constructs. Wild type MDCK cells grow as discrete colonies at subconfluent cell densities as do cells expressing activated Rho. As previously reported, cells expressing activated Ras do not form compact colonies but show extended processes and lamellipodia. A similar appearance is seen with cells expressing activated PI 3-kinase, the V12C40 Ras mutant that activates PI 3-kinase, and with cells expressing activated R-Ras. V38 R-Ras is able to interact with and activate PI 3-kinase in several cell types (31Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennström S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr.

Endocytosis of receptors such as the transferrin receptor from the plasma membrane is constitutive, whereas internalization of receptors such as the β-adrenergic receptor is stimulated by ligand binding (3Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 497-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A third type of endocytosis, compensatory endocytosis, recovers the extra membrane added to the plasma membrane when exocytosis is stimulated in a regulated secretory cell. All three types of endocytosis appear to use a similar coating mechanism that involves the heterotetrameric adaptor 2 complex (AP2), 1The abbreviations used are: AP2, adaptor protein 2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ddyn,Drosophila dynamin; PRD, proline-rich domain; SH3, src homology 3 domain; EH, Eps15 homology domain; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; oligo, oligonucleotide(s); DAP, dynamin-associated protein; csp, cysteine string protein. clathrin and dynamin (4Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). One apparent difference between the three is that compensatory endocytosis is faster than the other two (5Betz W.J. Wu L.-G. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A possible explanation of the efficiency of compensatory endocytosis is that the machinery of endocytosis is not free in the cytoplasm but is concentrated in the active zones, the sites of exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. The first indication of this was the discovery in Drosophila nerve terminals that dynamin, a large GTPase known to be necessary for synaptic vesicle biogenesis, is restricted to presynaptic sites that coincide with clusters of synaptic vesicles around active zones (1Estes P.S. Roos J. van der Bliek A. Kelly R.B. Krishnan K.S. Ramaswami M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5443-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dynamin concentrations at the plasma membrane are even more obvious (1Estes P.S. Roos J. van der Bliek A. Kelly R.B. Krishnan K.S. Ramaswami M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5443-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) when Drosophila shibirets1 mutants, temperature-sensitive in dynamin function, are depleted of synaptic vesicles by stimulating exocytosis at nonpermissive temperatures (6Koenig J.H. Ikeda K. J. Neurosci. 1989; 11: 3844-3860Crossref Google Scholar). The idea that these hot spots are indeed loci of intense endocytosis received strong support when it was found that AP2 co-localized with dynamin at these spots (2Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Jäckle H. Cell. 1997; 88: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These authors reported that AP2 distribution was even more tightly localized to the hot spots than dynamin. It thus seems plausible that Drosophila neurons have specialized sites on the plasma membrane at or close to the sites of exocytosis, where the endocytotic machinery accumulates. One way to understand how such an endocytotic machine might operate is to identify the other components of the complex, particularly those that might anchor it to the plasma membrane. In mammalian cells the C-terminal, proline-rich domain (PRD) of dynamin is involved in membrane anchoring since removing it inhibits the association of dynamin with the plasma membrane (7Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 8Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for the dynamin PRD in anchoring is the observation that the src homology 3 (SH3) domain of amphiphysin helps anchor dynamin via its PRD to neuronal plasma membranes in lamprey nerve terminals (9Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To find howDrosophila dynamin might be anchored at endocytotic hot spots, it seemed reasonable to look for a protein onDrosophila membranes to which the proline-rich domain ofDrosophila dynamin might bind. By using this approach, a new peripheral membrane protein has been identified that can be released from the membranes in a complex withDrosophila dynamin. Sequencing revealed that the protein is multimodular with four contiguous SH3 domains and an Eps15 homology (EH) domain. The SH3 domains were shown to be capable of binding dynamin and other PRD-containing proteins. Each SH3 domain, however, had a different repertoire of binding partners. EH domain-containing proteins have been implicated in receptor and fluid phase endocytosis in yeast (10Tang H.-Y. Munn A. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4294-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the progenitor of the family, Eps15, binds AP2 (11Iannolo G. Salcini A.E. Gaidarov I. Goodman Jr., O.B. Carpenter G. Pelicci P.G. DiFiore P.P. Keen J.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 240-245PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and clusters near the neck of clathrin-coated pits (12Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A ligand for the EH domain in the new protein has not yet been identified. One of only two proteins thus far demonstrated to bind to a GST-EH fusion protein is the Drosophila Numb protein (13Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santoline E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. DiFiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Numb, in turn, is membrane-associated, possesses a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, and associates with Numb-associated kinase (14Chien C.T. Wang S. Rothenberg M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, EH domain- and SH3 domain-containing proteins may function as either scaffolding or anchoring proteins. The multimodular protein we describe has, therefore, the capacity to bind simultaneously to several different proteins at once, and to keep them on a membrane. We refer to the protein we have isolated as dynamin-associated protein 160 kDa (Dap160). By immunofluorescence, Dap160 was restricted to the synaptic nerve terminal, or boutons, of Drosophilaneuromuscular junctions. In addition it was found in spots that were associated with active zones in the resting nerve terminal and in membrane-associated “hot spots” after depletion of vesicle content by stimulating Drosophila shibirets1mutants at the nonpermissive temperature. The observed distribution of Dap160 is indistinguishable from that reported for dynamin (1Estes P.S. Roos J. van der Bliek A. Kelly R.B. Krishnan K.S. Ramaswami M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5443-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and AP2 (2Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Jäckle H. Cell. 1997; 88: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, Dap160 has the properties expected of a membrane-associated scaffolding protein that helps hold proteins required for endocytosis close to where they are needed both before and during the recovery of synaptic vesicle membrane proteins. In so doing it could enhance the efficiency or the specificity of compensatory endocytosis. MBP-Ddyn(Δ241) fusion protein for anti-dynamin-specific antibodies was produced as follows. A 1.9-kilobase pair EcoRV-HpaI fragment from pBS(Ddyn3) (Alexander van der Bliek, UCLA School of Medicine), encodingDrosophila dynamin lacking the N-terminal 241 amino acids, was subcloned into the XmnI site of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), generating pJR2. GST-p160(JR120) fusion protein for anti-Dap160-specific antibodies was produced by using a 768-bpEcoRI fragment from pJR74 subcloned into theEcoRI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), generating pJR73. MBP-Ddyn fusion protein was generated for affinity purification of anti-dynamin-specific polyclonal antibodies. The following oligos were used to generate a full-length clone ofDrosophila dynamin by polymerase chain reaction (PCR): 5′-GGG GAA TTC ATG GAT AGT TTA ATT AC-3′ and 5′-GGG AAT TCA TCC CCT AGA TAC ATA TG-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), generating pJR5. The 2.5-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment was then excised from pJR5 and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pMAL-c2, generating pJR7. GST-Ddyn(PRD) fusion protein for overlay analysis was constructed by PCR from pBS(Ddyn3) to generate a fragment encoding the proline-rich domain of Drosophila dynamin (amino acids 750–836). The two oligos used for PCR were 5′-GTA CCG TGC TTG CAA GG-3′ and 5′-GGG AAT TCA TCC CCT AGA TAC ATA TG-3′. The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into pTA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) generating plasmid pTA(750–836). pTA(750–836) was then digested withEcoRI, and the 276-bp fragment containing the sequence encoding the proline-rich domain was subcloned into theEcoRI site of pGEX-5X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), generating pJR70. GST-SH3(ABCD), GST-SH3(BCD), GST-SH3(CD), GST-SH3(A), GST-SH3(B), GST-SH3(C), and GST-SH3(D) were constructed by PCR from Dap160–2 cDNA using a similar subcloning scheme to that described for GST-Ddyn(PRD). Oligos used in PCR were as follows: for GST-SH3(ABCD), 5′-AGT GCT TGG GAG GAG AC-3′ (primer JR125) and 5′-AAA TAA ACA CTA AAG TGG-3′ (primer JR128); for GST-SH3(BCD), 5′-CCC CGG TTG ATG CTC AA-3′ (primer JR129) and primer JR128; for GST-SH3(CD), 5′-GAT CAG GGA ATG CGT GC-3′ (primer JR135) and primer JR128; for GST-SH3(A), primer JR125 and 5′-GCC ACT TGA GCA TCA AC-3′; for GST-SH3(B), primer JR129 and 5′-GCA CGC ATT CCC TGA TC-3′; for GST-SH3(C), primer JR135 and 5′-ATT TTG TGC TTT GTA CG-3′; and for GST-SH3(D), 5′-CGT ACA AAG CAC AAA AT-3′ and primer JR128. PCR products were subcloned into pT-Adv (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), digested withEcoRI, and EcoRI fragments were subcloned into either pGEX-2T or pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST control fusion protein was generated by expression of the plasmid pGEX-3X. GST-grb2 was generously provided by Dr. Joseph Schlessinger (New York Uuniversity School of Medicine). GST-Amph(SH3) was kindly provided by Dr. Pietro De Camilli (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Expression of GST fusion proteins followed the recommendation of the manufacturer. Fusion protein containing lysates were generated as described by Kleidet al. (15Kleid D.G. Yansura D. Small B. Dowbenko D. Moore D.M. Grubman M.J. McKercher P.D. Morgan D.O. Robertson B.H. Bachrach H.L. Science. 1981; 214: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose (Sigma), eluted in glutathione elution buffer (100 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl), concentrated in a CentriPrep 10 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and dialyzed against PBS. Fusion protein concentration was determined using the BCA reagent system (Pierce) and then subsequently diluted to 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Polyclonal antibodies to Drosophiladynamin and Dap160 were raised against purified recombinant fusion protein. pJR2 was expressed and sent to Immuno-Dynamics, Inc. (La Jolla, CA) for antibody production, which generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies Ab2074 and Ab2075. pJR73 was expressed and sent to Alpha Diagnostic Inc. (San Antonio, TX) for antibody production, which generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies Ab1703 and Ab1704. Antibodies were affinity purified by the method of Smith and Fisher (16Smith D.E. Fisher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To affinity purify anti-dynamin antibodies from Ab2074 sera, MBP-Ddyn was overexpressed in bacteria and recovered as a sarkosyl extract (17Grieco F. Hay J.M. Hull R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 856-857PubMed Google Scholar). To affinity purify anti-Dap160 antibodies from Ab1703 sera, GST-p160(JR120) was overexpressed in bacteria and purified as described above. Sarkosyl extract containing MBP-Ddyn or purified recombinant GST-p160(JR120) fusion protein was resolved on a 5–15% SDS-PAGE preparative mini-gel and transferred to nitrocellulose using standard methods (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose bearing the fusion protein was excised, blocked in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA, washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA, and then incubated with sera overnight at 4 °C. The antibody-bound nitrocellulose was washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA and then eluted with 300-μl aliquots of 5 mm glycine, pH 2.3, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 100 mg/ml BSA. The eluates were immediately neutralized with 15.75 μl of 1 m Na2HPO4. To affinity purify anti-GST antibodies, GST was overexpressed in bacteria. Soluble recombinant protein was purified as described for GST-p160(JR120) above. Affinity purification proceeded as described above, using Ab1703 as the sera containing the anti-GST antibodies. Anti-amphiphysin I (CD5) antibody was the generous gift of Dr. Pietro De Camilli (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Anti-amphiphysin II-(1874) and anti-endophilin-(1903) antibodies were the generous gift of Dr. Peter McPherson (McGill University, Montreal). Anti-csp monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Konrad Zinsmaier (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia), and anti-SAP-47 and anti-synapsin mAbs were the generous gifts of Dr. Erich Buchner (Biozentrum der Universität Würzburg, Germany). Lastly, anti-clathrin polyclonal antisera was the generous gift of Dr. Mani Ramaswami (University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ). Samples for overlay analysis were prepared by resolving 20 μg of protein on 5–15% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and briefly stained with 0.2% Ponceau S. For single sample overlay analysis, each lane of the blot was excised, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk powder in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (BLOTTO), and incubated with 40 μg/ml fusion protein overnight at 4 °C. Fusion protein binding was determined by incubating the overlays with affinity purified anti-GST antibodies and detected with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cappel/ICN, Aurora, OH) and developed with ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's directions. All procedures were conducted on ice or at 4 °C. Heads from 10 ml packed wild-type (OR) adult flies, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C, were isolated using a molecular sieve (Fisher) and kept cold with liquid nitrogen. The heads were then ground using a mortar and pestle and subsequently homogenized in 2 ml of either Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA/0.1 mm MgCl2) or Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2) + protease inhibitors (leupeptin, 5 mg/ml, antipain, 2 mg/ml, benzamidine, 10 mg/ml, aprotinin, 10 mg/ml, pepstatin, 5 mg/ml, chymostatin, 1 mg/ml, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 20 strokes using a Teflon Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 20 min, resulting in an S1 and P1 fraction. The S1 fraction was then centrifuged at 25,000 × g in a Beckman TL100 tabletop ultracentrifuge for 30 min, resulting in an S2 and a P2 fractions. The S2 fraction was centrifuged at 208,000 × g in a Beckman TL100 tabletop ultracentrifuge for 60 min, resulting in an S3 and a P3 fraction. To generate rat brain cytosol, rat brains (PelFreeze, Rogers, AR) were diced and homogenized in Buffer A. The resulting homogenate was then fractionated as described above. Further fractionation of the cytosol was achieved by charging 50 mg of cytosol on a MonoQ 5/5 anion exchange FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluting the bound proteins with a 20-ml gradient (Buffer 1, Hepes buffer; Buffer 2, Hepes buffer, 1 m NaCl). 5 mg of DrosophilaS3 extract was resolved on a 24-ml Superdex 200 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using either a Bio-Rad BioLogic workstation or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech LC501 FPLC. Protein samples were eluted from the column with Buffer A at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. 30-μl samples from each fraction beginning with the void volume fraction were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, visualized with SYPRO Orange protein stain (Bio-Rad), and either Western blotted or processed for overlay analysis as described above. Superdex 200 gel filtration fractions immunopositive for dynamin and Dap160 were diluted to 1 ml with IP Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Tween 20). 25 μg of affinity purified anti-dynamin-specific polyclonal antibodies or equivalent preimmune antibodies were added. Immunoprecipitation reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with tumbling end over end. Immunoprecipitations were processed by addition of 30 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry, incubation at 4 °C with tumbling end over end for 2 h, and collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of IP Buffer and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluates were analyzed by resolving on a 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted using anti-Dap160 and anti-dynamin-specific antibodies. Heads from 2.5 liters of adultDrosophila Oregon-R flies were isolated. This resulted in 40 g of packed fly heads. The heads were ground in a mortar and pestle and homogenized in 500 ml of Hepes buffer. The extract was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was extracted with 500 ml of Buffer A. Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the extract was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was precipitated with 30% ammonium sulfate. The 30% ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of Buffer A and charged on a 250-ml Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and eluted with Buffer A. Three-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for the presence of Dap160 by the overlay assay. Dap160-positive fractions were then charged onto a DEAE-Sepharose column in Buffer A, washed extensively, and eluted with a Buffer A, 400 mm NaCl isocratic buffer flow. The DEAE eluate was concentrated, and 5-mg aliquots were charged onto a Superdex 200 FPLC column and eluted with Buffer A. Dap160-positive fractions, as determined by the overlay assay, were then charged onto a MonoQ FPLC column and eluted with a Buffer A → Buffer A, 1 m NaCl gradient. Dap160-positive fractions were pooled and resolved on a 5–15% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with SYPRO Orange, and the Dap160 band was excised from the gel. This band was then sent to the University of Michigan PCSF facility for protein microsequencing. mRNA from adult Drosophila(OR) heads was isolated using TRI-zol reagent (MBP, San Diego). First-strand cDNA was generated (45Doyle K. Promega Protocols and Applications Guide. 3rd Ed. 1996: 184Google Scholar) using oligo(dT) primer and SuperScriptII RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's suggestions. 1 ng of cDNA template was then used for PCR. From the peptide microsequencing data, the following degenerate oligos were designed. Peptide KIPVTLPQEW generated 5′-AAR ATH CCN GTN ACN YTN CCN CAR GAR TGG-3′ and was labeled 25F. The reverse complement corresponding to peptide IKEQNAKLPQ generated 5′-YTG NGG NAR YTT NGC RTT YTG YTC YTT DAT-3′ and was labeled 4050 RC. Polymerase chain reaction generated a 768-bp PCR product whose translation product contained both peptide sequences from the protein microsequencing project. Additional sequencing data were generated by PCR using a λgt11 expression library constructed by Ito et al. (19Ito N. Salvaterra P. Itakura K. Drosophila Information Service. 1985; 69: 81Google Scholar) as template and oligo JR116 (5′-CTC TGC TTG ACC CTT AA-3′) and the 5′ λgt11 sequencing primer. The full-length sequence was generated by using the 3′- and 5′-RACE kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). For 5′-RACE, oligo JR118 (5′-TAA GAG ACG ACA GCA GGC T-3′) was used first in conjunction with the abridged anchor primer in PCR round 1 and then with the AUAP primer in PCR round 2. For 3′-RACE, oligo JR108 (5′-AAA GCA GAA GGC ACA CA-3′) was used with the 3′ anchor primer in PCR round 1 and then oligo JR123 (5′-GCC CAC AAG CAG TTA AT-3′) was used with the AUAP primer in PCR round 2. All PCR was performed with the EXPAND High Fidelity PCR kit (BMB, Indianapolis, IN), and PCR products were subsequently subcloned into the pT-Adv cloning vector (CLONTECH) and sequenced using an ABI model 373A DNA sequencing machine by Yi Zhang in the UCSF/HRI sequencing facility. A full-length clone was generated by PCR from DrosophilacDNA using oligo JR131 (5′-noncoding region) and oligo JR139 (3′-noncoding region) and sequenced to confirm the sequence of Dap160. Third instar larval neuromuscular preparations were generated as described (1Estes P.S. Roos J. van der Bliek A. Kelly R.B. Krishnan K.S. Ramaswami M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5443-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for antibody staining and protein localization studies using a Leica TCS NT laser confocal microscope. Briefly, wild-type (Oregon-R) orshibirets1 crawling third instar larvae were pinned dorsal side up and filleted in calcium-free saline (130 mm NaCl, 36 mm sucrose, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA). Viscera were removed, allowing visualization of type 1b synaptic boutons innervating the ventral longitudinal muscles 6 and 7. shibirets1-depleted nerve terminals were stimulated in high K+ saline (75 mm NaCl, 36 mm sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2) at 30 °C for 10 min. After stimulation, the high K+ saline was replaced briefly with prewarmed calcium-free saline prior to fixation. Double-labeling experiments were performed using either affinity purified anti-dynamin or anti-Dap160 polyclonal antibodies in conjunction with anti-csp or anti-SAP-47 monoclonal antibodies. Secondary antibodies used in this study were goat anti-rabbit Texas Red (Cappel/ICN) and goat anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Cappel/ICN). Images were acquired using the Leica TCS software package. All images were viewed with a 100 × 1.4NA lens and the zoom set to 4. Z series were taken where the focal plane was stepped by 0.25 μm between images. When a protein such as dynamin is known to have a role in synaptic vesicle recycling, the fusion protein overlay (or far-Western) technique can be used to identify additional interacting proteins that may mediate recycling. The identification of binding partners for proteins enriched in the mammalian nerve terminal has focused on SH3-containing proteins, such as Grb2 and amphiphysin, that bind proline-rich domains present in synaptojanin and dynamin (20McPherson P.S.

A subset of the SH3-containing proteins identified by a polyproline peptide phage display screen (27Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) has been shown to bind to synaptojanin and is implicated in binding to dynamin (23de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K.

We have used the overlay technique to identify dynamin-binding proteins in Drosophila, hoping to take advantage of its favorable genetics. To detect proteins that contain SH3 domains, the proline-rich domain of Drosophila dynamin (Ddyn(PRD)) was fused to GST. Initial characterization of the GST-Ddyn(PRD) fusion is shown in Fig. 1 A. As a positive control, GST-Amph(SH3) (28David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) overlays on rat brain cytosol identified two proteins, a 145-kDa protein and a 100-kDa protein (lane 2). These two proteins are predicted to be synaptojanin and dynamin, as reported by David et al. (22David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). GST-Ddyn(PRD) interacted with three major proteins in rat brain cytosol of 120, 55, and 40 kDa (lane 3). A minor band was also seen at 80 kDa. The mobilities of the four dynamin PRD interacting proteins closely resemble the migration pattern of four proteins recently characterized by McPherson and colleagues (23de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) as synaptojanin-binding proteins. To confirm the identity of these four proteins, rat brain cytosol was fractionated on a MonoQ anion exchange column, and fractions were assayed by fusion protein overlays and by Western blotting using antibodies directed against three of the synaptojanin-binding proteins. The 120- and 80-kDa proteins co-migrate with amphiphysin I and amphiphysin II, respectively (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4). Assays on the MonoQ fraction containing the 55- and 40-kDa dynamin-interacting proteins support the conclusion that endophilin (SH3p4), a 40-kDa protein shown to interact with synaptojanin and dynamin (23de Heuvel E.

https://openalex.org/W2083879735,"Nucleolin is one of the major nonribosomal proteins of the nucleolus. Through its four RNA-binding domains, nucleolin interacts specifically with pre-rRNA as soon as synthesis begins, but it is not found in mature cytoplasmic ribosomes. Nucleolin is able to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. These data suggest that nucleolin might be involved in the nucleolar import of cytoplasmic components and in the assembly of pre-ribosomal particles. Here we show, using two-dimensional blots in a ligand blotting assay, that nucleolin interacts with 18 ribosomal proteins from rat (14 and 4 from the large and small subunit, respectively). The C-terminal domain of nucleolin (p50) interacts with 10 of these identified ribosomal proteins. In vitro binding assays show that the glycine-arginine rich domain of nucleolin (RGG domain) is sufficient for the interaction with one of these proteins. Interestingly, most of the proteins that interact with p50 belong to the core ribosomal proteins, which are resistant to extraction with high salt concentration. These findings suggest that nucleolin might be involved in the nucleolar targeting of some ribosomal proteins and in their assembly within pre-ribosomal particles.

In vitro binding assays show that the glycine-arginine rich domain of nucleolin (RGG domain) is sufficient for the interaction with one of these proteins. Interestingly, most of the proteins that interact with p50 belong to the core ribosomal proteins, which are resistant to extraction with high salt concentration. These findings suggest that nucleolin might be involved in the nucleolar targeting of some ribosomal proteins and in their assembly within pre-ribosomal particles. Ribosome biogenesis is a complex process that takes place in a specialized region of the cell nucleus called the nucleolus. Within this structure, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized by RNA polymerase I, then processed and assembled with ribosomal proteins to form pre-ribosomal particles, which are then exported to the cytoplasm. The ribosome is probably one of the most complex ribonucleoparticles, involving interaction of a large number of ribosomal proteins (33 and 47 for the small and large subunits, respectively) with four rRNA molecules (1Wool I.G. Chan Y.-L. Glück A. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 685-732Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that direct the assembly of rRNA with ribosomal proteins within the nucleolus and the pathways involved in nuclear and nucleolar import of ribosomal proteins are still largely unknown. The presence of a nuclear localization signal is necessary and sufficient to determine nuclear targeting of proteins (2Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar, 3Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Other signals are required for nucleolar targeting, sometimes overlapping the nuclear localization signal. It has been proposed that short highly basic sequences could be defined as nucleolar localization signals for HTLV-I Rex and HIV Tat and Rev proteins (4Siomi H. Shida H. Nam S.H. Nosaka T. Maki M.

Nucleolin, NO38, NSR1, and GAR1 are imported from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus where they participate in the formation of pre-ribosomal particles, which are then exported to the cytoplasm (7Peculis B.A. Gall J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Créancier L. Prats H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18499-18506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These nucleolar proteins exhibit sequences or protein domains required for nucleolar targeting. However these sequences are not sufficient by themselves to confer such localization when they are added to a cytoplasmic protein. Similarly, ribosomal proteins S6, L5, L7a, and L31 exhibit domains that have been localized within the protein and are required but not sufficient to confer nucleolar localization (12Russo G. Ricciardelli G. Pietropaolo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 52229-55235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol.

It was therefore concluded that nucleolar targeting was not because of the sole presence of a signal within the protein, but rather was proceeding from the cooperation of several domains and/or from the functional interactions of such domains with other molecules present in the nucleolus. Nucleolin is one of the most abundant nucleolar proteins (16Orrick L.R. Olson M.O.J. Bush H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1316-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The nucleolin sequence exhibits a modular organization in functional domains (17Lapeyre B. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Bouche G. Amalric F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5805-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of the molecule contains multiple phosphorylation sites (18Belenguer P. Caizergues-Ferrer M.

Four RNA-binding domains (RBD) 1The abbreviations used are: RBD, RNA-binding domain(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. constitute the nucleolin central domain. The first two RBD are involved in the recognition of a small RNA stem-loop structure (19Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 20Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol.

Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22Serin G. Joseph G. Faucher C. Ghisolfi L. Bouche G. Amalric F. Bouvet P. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1996; 78: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the specific interaction of nucleolin with 5′ external transcribed spacer sequences is required for the first step of ribosomal RNA processing in vitro (23Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain (RGG domain) is unusually rich in glycine, arginine, and phenylalanine. The RGG domain of nucleolin binds RNA nonspecifically and with low affinity (24Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This domain has been initially described as an RNA-binding motif in hnRNP U (25Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In hnRNP A1, this domain is not only involved in interaction with RNA (26Cobianchi F. Karpel R.L. Williams K.R. Notario V. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Nadler S.G. Merrill B.M. Robert W.J. Keating K.M. Lisbin M.J. Barnett S.F. Wilson S.H. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but also in protein-protein interaction (28Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Nucleolin interacts only transiently with rRNA and pre-ribosomal particles (19Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 29Bourbon H.M. Bugler B. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Zalta J.P. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 9: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and is not detectable in mature cytoplasmic ribosomes. This suggests that nucleolin is removed during the assembly and/or the processing steps of pre-ribosomal particles. In addition, one remarkable characteristic of nucleolin is that it shuttles constantly between the nucleolus and the cytoplasm (30Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). These observations led us to postulate that nucleolin could act as a carrier for ribosomal proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus and as an adaptor for specific binding of ribosomal proteins to rRNA. This functional model suggests a possible direct interaction between nucleolin and ribosomal proteins. In this report, we show that nucleolin interacts through its RGG C-terminal domain with a subset of ribosomal proteins. This suggests that nucleolin may have a role in the assembly of the ribosomal subunits by bringing together ribosomal proteins and rRNA. Nuclei were prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells (Computer Cells, Belgium) and lyzed in low ionic-strength buffer. The resulting extract was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) as described previously (43Caizergues-Ferrer M. Belenguer P. Lapeyre B. Amalric F. Wallace M.O. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Fractions containing nucleolin were then subjected to anion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nucleolin was eluted with a 0.2–1 m KCl gradient made in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 30% glycerol. Valuable fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and purification were performed as described previously (20Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional-PAGE of ribosomal proteins were performed as described previously, using the electrophoretic system II (basic-SDS) (32Madjar J.J. Arpin M. Buisson M. Reboud J.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 171: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After separation, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll), and immobilized proteins were stained with a Ponceau S solution made in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Membranes were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, then for another 15 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated for 90 min at room temperature in buffer A (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Nucleolin or p50 protein was then added at a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed four times during 10 min in buffer A before being subjected to a standard Western blot analysis. Briefly, membranes were incubated for 30 min in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm MgCl2) containing 5% nonfat milk. Anti-nucleolin polyclonal antibody (produced against the hamster p50 recombinant protein) was added to this buffer and incubated for 1 h. After four washes of 10 min each, secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was added for 30 min, and detection of this antibody was performed with ECL reagent solutions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Messenger RNA for rat ribosomal protein L3 was synthesized in vitro from pGem2-L3 plasmid (gift of Dr. Y.-L. Chan-Leung and Dr. I. G. Wool, University of Chicago, IL) using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). This synthetic RNA was used for in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified nucleolin was biotinylated as described previously (19Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Biotinylated nucleolin-L3 complexes were recovered with magnetic streptavidin beads (Dynal). Beads were first extensively washed with binding buffer made of 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. In a standard experiment, 1 μl of in vitrosynthesized radiolabeled L3 was incubated with the indicated amount of nucleolin in 100 μl of binding buffer for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were then extensively washed with binding buffer for a complete removal of unbound L3, then resuspended in electrophoresis buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). L3 bound to nucleolin peptides fused to the histidine tag was recovered using Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) in the binding buffer. The recombinant RGG domain was produced fused to a small peptide known as a “T7-Tag” (24Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-T7 antibodies (Novagen) were bound on protein A-Sepharose beads in the NT2 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) for 20 min at 4 °C. Tagged RGG protein was then added to the beads and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with shaking. After two washes with NT2 buffer, labeled L3 proteins were added to the beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed by three washes with NT2 and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (20% final volume). Bound and unbound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Direct interaction of nucleolin with ribosomal proteins was evaluated using a ligand blotting assay (far-Western). Ribosomal proteins were extracted from rat liver ribosomes and separated by two-dimensional-PAGE allowing separation of most of the 80 ribosomal proteins and their unambiguous identification (32Madjar J.J. Arpin M. Buisson M. Reboud J.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 171: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After separation, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and stained with Ponceau red (Fig. 1, panels A1and B1). For far-Western blotting, transferred proteins were renatured and incubated with purified hamster nucleolin. After extensive washing, the presence of nucleolin bound to ribosomal proteins was revealed with a polyclonal anti-nucleolin antibody raised against the recombinant nucleolin C-terminal domain (Fig. 1,panel A2). Superposition of the spots obtained after detection of nucleolin bound to ribosomal proteins (Fig. 1, panel A2) with those on the membrane stained with Ponceau red used for far-Western blotting (Fig. 1, panel A1) allowed the identification of ribosomal proteins that interacted with nucleolin (Fig. 1, panel A3). This experiment revealed that 14 proteins of the large ribosomal subunit and 4 of the small one interacted with hamster nucleolin. These proteins are listed in TableI. As controls, two experiments were performed. First, the anti-nucleolin antibody was directly incubated with ribosomal proteins previously separated by two dimensional-PAGE and transferred to another membrane, similar to that used in the previous experiment. Under these conditions no signal was obtained, indicating that anti-nucleolin antibody did not recognize ribosomal proteins (data not shown). This confirms the already published specificity of these polyclonal antibodies raised against nucleolin (19Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In another ligand blotting assay, total rat nuclear proteins were used instead of purified ribosomal proteins. In these conditions, only two nuclear proteins were found to interact strongly with nucleolin (data not shown). Although these interactions have not been further characterized, one of them could represent histone H1, which has been previously shown to interact with nucleolin (31Erard M. Belenguer P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Pantaloni A. Amalric F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of most ribosomal proteins are extremely well conserved in mammals about 95–100% between human and rat ribosomal proteins (1Wool I.G. Chan Y.-L. Glück A. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 685-732Google Scholar). Therefore, to further confirm the specificity of the interaction between nucleolin and ribosomal proteins, a ligand-blotting assay similar to that described above was performed with human ribosomal proteins purified from HeLa cell ribosomes (Fig. 1, panels B1–B3). In these conditions, 16 human ribosomal proteins of the 18 homologous rat proteins were found to interact with hamster nucleolin (Table I). L10 and L15, which were poorly detected on the far-Western blot performed with rat ribosomal proteins, were not detected at all with human proteins. Two additional proteins, S26 and L35a, were detected with hamster nucleolin when human instead of rat ribosomal proteins were used. The fact that most of the rat ribosomal proteins found to interact with hamster nucleolin were identical to those from HeLa cells indicates that the interaction is specific. Independent confirmation of these results was obtained from an in vitro binding assay. Biotinylated hamster nucleolin was incubated with rat 35S-labeled ribosomal protein L3 synthesizedin vitro. L3 was found to interact with nucleolin in both types of far-Western experiments described above. Bound proteins were recovered on streptavidin magnetic beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). L3 was recovered on the beads only in the presence of nucleolin (lane 3) showing that in vitro synthesized L3 interacted with nucleolin.Table IIdentification of ribosomal proteins that interact with nucleolinHamster nucleolinaProteins used in the overlay assay.Recombinant hamster p50aProteins used in the overlay assay.HumanbOrigin of the ribosomal proteins.RatbOrigin of the ribosomal proteins.RatbOrigin of the ribosomal proteins.Ribosomal proteins interacting with nucleolin and p50L3L3L3L4L4L4L5L5—cDashes indicates that the ribosomal protein does not interact with the protein used in the corresponding overlay assay.L6L6L6L7L7L7L8L8L8L9L9——L10L10L13aL13a——L15L15L18L18L18L18aL18aL18aL28L28—L35a——L37aL37a—S3aS3a—S8S8S8S9S9—S11S11—S26——Interactions of hamster nucleolin with rat or human ribosomal proteins and of recombinant p50 protein with rat ribosomal proteins were performed as described in the legend of Fig. 1 and reported in this table.a Proteins used in the overlay assay.b Origin of the ribosomal proteins.c Dashes indicates that the ribosomal protein does not interact with the protein used in the corresponding overlay assay.

To identify the nucleolin domain responsible for the interaction with the ribosomal proteins, the ligand blotting assay was repeated using a truncated recombinant nucleolin, p50, comprised of the C-terminal part of hamster nucleolin only (see Fig. 3 A). The p50 protein contains the four RBD and one RGG domain. Both the full-length nucleolin and the deleted p50 proteins interact through their RBD with the same RNA target (20Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In a far-Western experiment, 10 rat ribosomal proteins were found to interact with p50 (Table I). Remarkably, all these proteins were also detected when full-length nucleolin was used to probe rat ribosomal proteins. 8 human homologous proteins of these 10 rat proteins were also found to interact with p50 (not shown). The rat ribosomal proteins that did not react with p50 (L5, L9, L13a, L28, L37a, S3a, S9, and S11) might therefore interact with nucleolin through its N-terminal end. To further determine which domain of p50 interacts with these ribosomal proteins several recombinants proteins were used that were constituted of different domains of p50 (Fig. 3 A). These recombinant proteins (RBD 1–2, RBD 3–4, RBD 3–4-RGG) were designed to preserve the structural integrity of each RNA-binding domain (20Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A histidine tag was fused to the N-terminal end of each recombinant protein. After incubation with 35S-labeled L3 synthesized in vitro, proteins bound to the nucleolin peptides were recovered on Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads. In these experimental conditions, L3 did not interact with the agarose beads (Fig. 3 B,lane 2). When recombinant proteins containing only RBD 1–2 or RBD 3–4 were bound to the beads, no L3 was recovered, indicating that these domains did not contain a binding site for L3. In contrast, a protein containing RBD 3–4 together with the RGG domain was sufficient to recover L3 very efficiently. Because the RBD 3–4 alone was unable to bind L3, the RGG domain appeared to be the binding site for L3. To test this hypothesis, another recombinant protein containing the RGG domain alone, fused to a T7-Tag, was produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. As described above, this protein was incubated with 35S-labeled L3 synthesized in vitro, and the mixture was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-T7-Tag antibody to pull down proteins associated with the recombinant RGG domain. As shown in Fig. 3 B (lanes 10–11), the nucleolin RGG domain alone was sufficient to recover L3 efficiently. This result indicates that the RGG C-terminal domain of nucleolin is the minimal domain required for interaction of nucleolin with ribosomal protein L3. In this report we show that nucleolin interacts with a subset of ribosomal proteins. These interactions are observed between hamster nucleolin and rat or human ribosomal proteins. The C-terminal RGG domain of nucleolin is responsible for the interaction with the L3 protein and is also very likely responsible for the interaction with all ribosomal proteins detected with p50. The ability of nucleolin to interact specifically with both ribosomal RNA sequences through its RNA-binding domains (19Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 20Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol.

Biochimie ( Paris ). 1996; 78: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and with ribosomal proteins strongly supports the hypothesis that nucleolin is involved in ribosome assembly. We found that the C-terminal domain of nucleolin (p50; Table I) mediates the interaction of hamster nucleolin with 10 of 18 rat ribosomal proteins. It is unlikely that these interactions are based simply on the basicity of these ribosomal proteins since L3 (pI: 10,63) and S8 (pI: 10,73), which interact with p50, and L17 (pI: 10,63), S2 (pI: 10,66), and S15 (pI: 10,81), which do not interact with this nucleolin domain, have comparable basic pIs. The N-terminal domain of nucleolin, which contains acidic motifs, is a candidate for electrostatic interactions with basic regions of the 8 ribosomal proteins not interacting with the C-terminal part of nucleolin. These interactions have not been further characterized. The RGG motif was initially described as an RNA-binding motif in hnRNP U, hnRNP A1, and nucleolin (24Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G.

Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). The interaction of the RGG domain with RNA does not seem to require a specific RNA sequence and involves low RNA binding affinity (24Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 26Cobianchi F. Karpel R.L.

Although the amino acid composition of the RGG domain found in different proteins is very similar, their RNA binding properties are quite different. The RGG domain of hnRNP U binds single-stranded DNA and homopolymeric poly(G) and poly(U) in high salt conditions, whereas the RGG domain of hnRNP A1 does not (25Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In nucleolin, the RGG domain binds RNA nonspecifically and with low affinity. Furthermore, it is not involved in determining the nucleolin RNA binding specificity (20Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. Eur. J.

Studies on the RNA binding properties of hnRNP A1 have implicated its RGG domain in both direct interaction with nucleic acid and in the cooperative binding of A1 to RNA (26Cobianchi F. Karpel R.L. Williams K.R. Notario V. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nadler S.G. Merrill B.M. Robert W.J. Keating K.M. Lisbin M.J. Barnett S.F. Wilson S.H. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This suggests that this domain is involved in protein-protein interactions. More recently, the RGG domain of hnRNP A1 was shown to interact in vitro in a nucleic acid-independent way with both other hnRNP proteins and with itself (28Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect any homomeric interactions of the nucleolin RGG domain (data not shown), indicating that this kind of interaction is probably not a general feature of all RGG domains. Furthermore, in our experimental conditions, nucleolin was never found to interact with ribosomal protein S2, which contains a RGG motif (34Suzuki K. Olvera J. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20007-20010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that the RGG domain of nucleolin is involved in protein-protein interactions, similarly to hnRNP A1 (28Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggests that one general function of proteins that contain an RGG domain in association with an RBD motif might be to direct the assembly of protein complexes on specific RNA sequences. The RGG domain of hnRNP A1, fibrillarin, and nucleolin contain the modified amino acidNG,NG-dimethylarginine (35Lischwe M.A. Cook R.G. Ahn Y.S. Yeoman L.C. Busch H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6025-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 36Lischwe M.A. Ochs R.L. Reddy R. Cook R.G. Yeoman L.C. Tan E.M. Reichlin M. Busch H. J. Biol.

Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5185-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The significance of this posttranslational modification on RNA binding is not known. A recombinant RGG domain produced in E. coli interacts as efficiently as purified nucleolin with in vitro translated L3 ribosomal protein. This suggests thatNG,NG-dimethylarginines are not absolutely required for this interaction. The nucleolar localization of nucleolin requires at least two RBD or one RBD together with the RGG domain in addition to the nuclear localization sequence (8Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Créancier L. Prats H. Zanibellato C. Amalric F. Bugler B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This suggests that nucleolin accumulates within the nucleolus by virtue of binding to ribosomal RNA. It has been shown that nucleolin shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm (30Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), and it was speculated that nucleolin could play a role in the transport of ribosomal components from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and nucleolus. The demonstration that nucleolin interacts directly with ribosomal proteins supports this hypothesis. It has been recently proposed that a specific pathway (45Yaseen N.R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4451-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 46Rout M.P. Blobel G. Aitchison J.D. Cell. 1997; 89: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) mediates the import of ribosomal proteins into the nucleus. It would be interesting to determine if nucleolin is involved in this import pathway. Nucleolin purified from hamster cells interacts with 16 homologous ribosomal proteins from either rat or human origin. In addition to these proteins, hamster nucleolin interacts with rat L10 and L15 and with human S26 and L35a. The sequence of rat L10 was found to display a 99% amino acid identity with a putative tumor suppressor human protein, QM, and 94% with a chicken protein, Jif-1 (38Chan Y.-L. Diaz J.-J. Denoroy L. Madjar J.-J. Wool I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The sequence of HeLa cell L10 is not available nor are those of S26 and L15. A comparison between the electrophoretic behavior of proteins extracted from rat liver and from HeLa cell ribosomes indicates that rat L15 should be somewhat different than its HeLa cell counterpart (see Refs. 32Madjar J.J. Arpin M. Buisson M. Reboud J.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 171: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 39Madjar J.-J. Traut R.R. Mol. Gen.

Gen. Genet. 1979; 169: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The differences in the binding ability of nucleolin to human and rat L15, S26, and L10 could therefore reflects some differences between these proteins. However it remains to be proved that the binding of nucleolin to these proteins is indeed significant. It is remarkable that 5 of the 10 proteins that interact with p50 (L3, L4, L6, L18a, and S8) cannot be extracted from ribosomes with 3m LiCl, whereas 4 other proteins (L7, L8, L15, and L18) can be extracted only at high salt concentration (41Welfle H. Henkel B. Bielka H. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1976; 35: 401-411PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that salt sensitivity may reflect a more or less internal localization of the protein in the particle and also the order of their assembly during biogenesis of ribosomal subunits. Ribosomal proteins extracted only with high salt concentration are therefore expected to have an internal localization within the ribosome and to be among the first proteins assembled within the pre-ribosomal particles. Furthermore, it was found that core ribosomal proteins, resistant to extraction with 3 m LiCl, were found specifically bound to rRNA (42Reboud J.P. Reboud A.M. Madjar J.J. Buisson M. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1974; 33: 661-666PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of ribosomal protein L4 on electron microscopic spreads of active rRNA genes is consistent with an early association of this protein with rRNA (47Chooi W.Y. Leiby K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4823-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The interaction of nucleolin with specific ribosomal RNA targets (19Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F.

Dimerization of two oxygenase domains allows electrons to transfer from the flavins to the heme irons, which enables O2 binding and NO synthesis froml-arginine. In an iNOS heterodimer comprised of one full-length subunit and an oxygenase domain partner, the single reductase domain transfers electrons to only one of two hemes (Siddhanta, U., Wu, C., Abu-Soud, H.

Here, we characterize a pair of heterodimers that contain an l-Arg binding mutation (E371A) in either the full-length or oxygenase domain subunit to identify which heme iron becomes reduced. The E371A mutation prevented l-Arg binding to one oxygenase domain in each heterodimer but did not affect thel-Arg affinity of its oxygenase domain partner and did not prevent heme iron reduction in any case. The mutation prevented NO synthesis when it was located in the oxygenase domain of the adjacent subunit but had no effect when in the oxygenase domain in the same subunit as the reductase domain. Resonance Raman characterization of the heme-l-Arg interaction confirmed that E371A only prevents l-Arg binding in the mutated oxygenase domain.

Although the full-length iNOS monomer still binds its flavin and heme groups and can transfer electrons from NADPH into its flavins, it can no longer catalyze reduction of its heme iron (29Siddhanta U.

To investigate how iNOS dimerization, electron transfer, and catalytic function are related, we characterized an iNOS “heterodimer” comprised of one full-length and one iNOSox subunit. The single reductase domain of this “wild-type” heterodimer transferred NADPH-derived electrons to only one of the two heme irons located in the dimeric oxygenase core, but this was sufficient to support a normal rate of NO synthesis by that heme (29Siddhanta U. Wu C. Abu-Soud H.M. Zhang J. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7309-7312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although these results showed that dimerization enables the flavin-to-heme electron transfer, they did not identify which of the two hemes accepts electrons from the single reductase domain and thus did not distinguish whether electron transfer occurs between flavin and heme groups located in the same or adjacent subunits of a dimer.In the current report, we address this question by constructing a complimentary pair of iNOS heterodimers, each comprised of one wild-type subunit and one subunit containing a point mutation (E371A) that causes an exclusive and absolute defect in l-Arg binding (22Gachhui R. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Parkinson J.P. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The catalytic, spectroscopic, and electron transfer properties of these complimentary heterodimers and of a heterodimer selectively enriched in 54Fe establishes the electron transfer pathway in iNOS, and helps explain why dimer formation is essential to complete electron transfer to the heme.DISCUSSIONBecause NOS heme iron reduction is critical for NO synthesis, it is important to understand the path of electron transfer and how it is controlled. During NO synthesis the reductase domain flavins accept electrons from NADPH and transfer them to the heme irons located in the oxygenase domains. However, the homodimeric structure of iNOS introduces complexity to this system and creates three possibilities regarding electron transfer from a single reductase domain. Electrons could flow to both hemes, only to the heme located on the same subunit, or only to the heme located on the opposite subunit. Our previous work with an iNOS heterodimer revealed that its single reductase domain transfers electrons to only one of the two oxygenase domain heme irons. There was no subsequent sharing of electrons between hemes, and this system supported a normal rate of NO synthesis (29Siddhanta U. Wu C. Abu-Soud H.M. Zhang J. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7309-7312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here, we generated a complimentary pair of heterodimers that contained anl-Arg binding mutation (E371A) in either oxygenase domain to make the oxygenase domains dissimilar and identify which of the two heme irons becomes reduced. Our data is consistent with electron transfer from the single reductase domain proceeding exclusively to the oxygenase domain that represents the adjacent subunit.Our conclusion derives from experiments that detailed the basis of each mutant heterodimer's catalytic profile. Such analysis is essential when using mutagenesis to investigate structure-function aspects of any NOS dimer, because in principle a single oxygenase point mutation could affect the functioning of the domain in which the mutation is present, the adjacent wild-type domain, or both domains. The E371A mutation completely prevents l-Arg binding when present in both oxygenase domains of an iNOSox (22Gachhui R. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Parkinson J.P. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or full-length iNOS homodimer. When the E371A mutation was present in only one of two oxygenase domains of a heterodimer, it completely prevented l-Arg binding to one oxygenase domain in each heterodimer, but did not affect thel-Arg affinity of the oxygenase domain partner and did not prevent heme iron reduction in any case. The E371A mutation prevented NO synthesis when it was located in the oxygenase domain opposite to the reductase domain but had no effect on NO synthesis when it was located in the same subunit as the reductase domain. Our54Fe resonance Raman study showed that the E371A mutation only affected l-Arg binding within the same oxygenase domain in which the mutation was present, and consequently revealed that a bound l-Arg molecule interacts only with the heme that is located in the same oxygenase component to whichl-Arg is bound. 7The resonance Raman data is consistent with recent crystallographic structures of the iNOSox monomer and dimer that show Glu-371 is located near the heme that is bound within the same subunit, and binds to the guanidino nitrogens of l-Arg such that they are held above that same heme iron (25Crane B.R.

Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Together, this led us to conclude that heme iron reduction in the heterodimer must occur entirely in the oxygenase domain adjacent to the full-length subunit, and this enables the oxygenase domain to generate NO by oxidizing the l-Arg molecule bound within it.Our findings establish a critical link between iNOS dimeric structure and heme reduction that helps explain how dimerization activates iNOS. Previous studies had shown that only the oxygenase domains of iNOS participate in the dimeric interaction (17Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11316-11320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We now propose that the oxygenase-oxygenase interaction enables the enzyme to engage in a type of “domain swapping” (40Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) shown in Fig. 11, which in turn allows NADPH-derived electrons to transfer between reductase and oxygenase domains that are located on adjacent subunits. This arrangement possibly circumvents a physical barrier for electron transfer between reductase and oxygenase domains located on the same subunit (29Siddhanta U. Wu C. Abu-Soud H.M. Zhang J. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7309-7312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Dimerization also enables the oxygenase domains to stably incorporate H4B and to bind l-Arg with high affinity (23Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Molony M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,27Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This impacts on iNOS electron transfer in a different way through an effect of H4B and l-Arg on the heme. In the absence of bound l-Arg and H4B, the heme irons in an iNOS dimer are solvent-exposed (23Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Molony M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and are poised at such a low reduction potential (−350 mV) that they appear to be thermodynamically unable to accept electrons from the reductase domain flavins (41Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). 8The iNOS flavin reduction potentials are unknown. However, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, which is structurally homologous to the NOS reductase domain, exhibits flavin midpoint potentials of −270 and −290 mV for its one- and two-electron-reduced forms (55Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2694-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding either H4B or l-Arg to the dimer alters the heme environment and increases the heme iron reduction potential by 50 or 100 mV, respectively (41Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, dimerization properly orients iNOS reductase and oxygenase domains for electron transfer, and creates an environment where substrate and pterin can positively modulate the thermodynamics of heme iron reduction.Given our iNOS structure-function model in Fig. 11, it is important to consider the model's limitations and the implications of the domain swapping interaction. Although our data support an exclusive interaction between adjacent reductase and oxygenase domain pairs in an iNOS homodimer, it is still possible that electrons could exchange between the two reductase domains in the homodimer prior to transfer to an individual oxygenase domain. Such “short circuiting” of electron transfer would result in both hemes receiving electrons that were originally provided to a single reductase domain by NADPH. Present evidence suggests that short circuiting may not occur. For example, during titrations with NADPH, electron transfer between individual reductase domains in solution occurs only slowly. 9L. Huang and D. J. Stuehr, unpublished results. Also, the crystal structure of the iNOSox dimer shows that the two reductase domains would be attached on opposite sides of the dimeric oxygenase core with each one positioned to interact with an exposed heme edge located on the backside of the adjacent subunit's oxygenase domain (26Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar).Which protein residues facilitate electron transfer between reductase and oxygenase domains are still unknown. However, putative domain contact regions have already been suggested based on the crystal structures of iNOSox (25Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1997; 278: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 26Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) and of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (42Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S.M. Kim J.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), which is a protein homologous to the reductase domain of iNOS. Interestingly, the proposed contact region on the surface of iNOSox may only become exposed upon dimerization (26Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), implying another key role for this process. Molecules that antagonize the reductase-oxygenase interaction probably exist both in nature and in the laboratory. For example, cytochrome c (43Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Bohme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), caveolin (44Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol.

Schmidt K. Nitric Oxide: Biol., and Chem. 1997; 1: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) may bind to the oxygenase or reductase contact sites and inhibit NO synthesis by blocking domain interactions required for electron transfer to the heme.Electron transfer as depicted in Fig. 11 takes place between noncovalently linked reductase and oxygenase domains of the dimer. However, their productive interaction probably requires that the reductase domains still remain covalently linked to the dimeric core, because mixing detached reductase monomers with iNOSox dimers promotes only inefficient heme reduction and slow NO synthesis (48Gosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11316-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reductase-oxygenase interaction does not endow the full-length iNOS dimer with greater stability than an iNOSox dimer (27Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and, unlike the oxygenase-oxygenase domain interaction, does not remain intact after the reductase and oxygenase domains are separated by limited proteolysis (17Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11316-11320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CaM is likely to have an important role in the reductase-oxygenase domain interaction of iNOS, because it controls electron transfer between these domains in the neuronal and endothelial NOS isoforms (6Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 49Presta A. Liu J. Sessa W.C. Stuehr D.J. Nitric Oxide: Biol., and Chem. 1997; 1: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interaction between neuronal NOS and the “latch region” of CaM appears to be essential for electron transfer to its heme (51Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 52Gachhui R. Abu-Soud H.M. Ghosh D.K. Presta A. Blazing M.A. Mayer B. George S.E. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5451-5454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whether a similar interaction controls iNOS heme reduction is an interesting possibility. CaM binding to iNOS is essentially irreversible (50Cho H.J. Xie Q-w. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and may therefore promote a more stable reductase-oxygenase domain interaction compared with neuronal and endothelial NOS, which bind CaM reversibly depending on the local Ca2+ concentration (1MacMicking J. Xie Q.-w. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar, 2Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The domain swapping model provides a new perspective to all of the issues noted above.Domain swapping as envisioned for iNOS is a relatively common feature among oligomeric proteins, and often provides advantages in function and control that are unavailable to the protein monomer (40Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Domain swapping provides a way for iNOS to prevent uncoupled NADPH oxidation and may provide a means for H4B function or for CaM control of heme iron reduction. In general, interactions between domains from adjacent subunits arise only after oligomerization has occurred in evolution of the protein's structure. Over time, intersubunit interactions often replace an original intrasubunit interaction between domains linked together on the polypeptide monomer, because after oligomerization the intrasubunit interaction is not under selective pressure to be maintained (40Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the iNOS polypeptide probably acquired its bi-domain structure first (linked reductase and oxygenase domains), followed by its dimeric structure, which eventually led to reliance on intersubunit interactions between adjacent reductase and oxygenase domains for heme iron reduction (and NO synthesis). Evidence that some bacteria express NOS activity and contain genes encoding an oxygenase domain-like protein (56Morita H. Yoshikawa H. Sakata R. Nagata Y. Tanaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7812-7815Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggest that more primitive forms of the enzyme exist and may help trace the evolution of this complex enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2050630630,"Arachidonic acid (C20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesized by the Δ5-fatty acid desaturation of di-homo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3 Δ8,11,14). In mammals, it is known to be a precursor of the prostaglandins and the leukotrienes but it is also accumulated by the filamentous fungusMortierella alpina. We have isolated a cDNA encoding the Δ5-fatty acid desaturase from M. alpinavia a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy using primers designed to the conserved histidine box regions of microsomal desaturases, and confirmed its function by expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of the lipids from the transformed yeast demonstrated the accumulation of arachidonic acid. The M. alpina Δ5-desaturase is the first example of a cloned Δ5-desaturase, and differs from other fungal desaturases previously characterized by the presence of an N-terminal domain related to cytochrome b 5. Arachidonic acid (C20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesized by the Δ5-fatty acid desaturation of di-homo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3 Δ8,11,14).

The M. alpina Δ5-desaturase is the first example of a cloned Δ5-desaturase, and differs from other fungal desaturases previously characterized by the presence of an N-terminal domain related to cytochrome b 5. The filamentous fungus M. alpina is unusual in that it can produce a wide range of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It differs from higher plants in its fatty acid unsaturation as it is able to produce arachidonic acid (C20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) and eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 Δ5,8,11,14,17) (1Shimizu S. Shinmen Y. Kawashima H. Akimoto K. Yamada H. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In filamentous fungi, polyunsaturated fatty acids are present both in the phospholipids and the triacylglycerols, indicating that they have a role in membrane structure and as storage oils (2Jackson F.M. Michaelson L.V. Fraser T.C.M. Stobart A.K. Griffiths G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). In animals, arachidonic acid is a precursor of the short-lived regulatory molecules, the eicosanoids, which comprise the prostaglandins, the leukotrienes, and the thromboxanes (3Horrobin D.F. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 167-194Crossref Scopus (421) Google Scholar). All mammalian cells except erythrocytes synthesize eicosanoids, and among their many functions they are involved in inflammatory response, reproductive function, and regulation of blood pressure (4Horrobin D.F. Rev. Contemp. Pharmacother. 1990; 1: 1-45Google Scholar). In fungi, unsaturated fatty acids are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum by the action of integral membrane-bound fatty-acid desaturase enzymes, which sequentially insert double bonds into the acyl chain (5Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Jackson F.M. Fraser T.C.M. Smith M.A. Lazarus C. Stobart A.K. Griffiths G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Δ5-desaturase is responsible for the conversion of di-homo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3 Δ8,11,14) to arachidonic acid. It is thought to function like the other microsomal desaturases from higher plants and yeast, catalyzing aerobic reactions requiring cytochromeb 5 as a co-factor. Electrons are transferred from NADH-dependent cytochrome b 5reductase, via the heme-containing cytochrome b 5molecule to the fatty acid desaturase (7Dailey H.A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5184-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Smith M.A. Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Griffiths W.T. Stymne S. Stobart A.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of membrane-bound desaturases has been limited because they are difficult to purify due to their hydrophobic nature. Hence, molecular genetic approaches, particularly the use ofArabidopsis mutants, have provided much information on desaturation reactions (9Arondel V. Lemieux B. Hwang I. Gibson S. Goodman H. Somerville C.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1353-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 10Okuley J. Lightner J. Feldmann K. Yadav N. Lark E. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Analysis of the predicted protein sequences for the higher plant desaturases together with those from cyanobacteria, yeast, and mammals revealed the presence of eight highly conserved histidine residues (11Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies on the microsomal Δ9-desaturase from rat and the Δ12-desaturase from Synechocystis (11Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox D.C.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that all of the conserved histidines were catalytically essential. Variation is present within the amino acid sequences between the conserved histidine residues, but sequence alignments have permitted the design of degenerate oligonucleotides capable of amplifying novel desaturase gene fragments from various sources (13Schmidt H. Dresselhaus T. Buck F. Heinz E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Anamnart S. Tomita T. Fukui F. Fujimori K. Harashima S. Yamada Y. Oshima Y.

Although the approach has yielded gene probes for a variety of microsomal desaturase activities including Δ6, Δ9, and Δ12, no information is available yet for a Δ5-desaturase. Here, we describe the successful application of this approach to the isolation of a Δ5-fatty acid desaturase from the fungus Mortierella alpina. M. alpina CBS 210.32 was grown in liquid culture in potato dextrose medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 28 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. After 48 h, mycelium was harvested and used in fatty acid analysis and various DNA and RNA extractions. Mucor circinelloides was grown in liquid culture in potato dextrose medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 25 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Mycelium was harvested after 48 h, and DNA was extracted. Total RNA was isolated from 400 mg wet weight of mycelium using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) and 5 μg was reverse transcribed with the Ready-To-GoTMT-primed first strand kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The cDNA was used as a template for PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); GC, gas chromatography; FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; MS, mass spectroscopy. amplification with degenerate primers. Approximately 4 g wet weight of mycelium was ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen using a precooled mortar and pestle. The ground tissue was added to 10 ml of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mmEDTA, 0.5% SDS), thawed, and mixed gently by inversion. Ten ml of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar) were added and mixed gently for 15–30 min. The organic and aqueous phases were separated by centrifugation and the aqueous layer removed to a fresh centrifuge tube. This extraction was repeated until the interface between the two phases was clear, after which an extraction with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was carried out. DNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and purified by two rounds of equilibrium centrifugation in a CsCl ethidium bromide density gradient. The band containing genomic DNA was removed from the gradient and diluted with TE buffer. DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in TE buffer. Highly degenerate primers were synthesized using inosine for 4-base redundancy and extended at the 5′ ends to include EcoRI restriction sites to facilitate cloning PCR products. The forward primer was, 5′-GCGAATTC(A/G)TIGGICA(T/C)GA(T/C) TG(T/C)GGICA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GCGAATTCATIT(G/T)IGG(A/G)AAIA(G/A)(A/G)TG(A/G)TG-3′, where I stands for inosine and the EcoRI sites are underlined. The primers were used for PCR amplification of cDNA reverse transcribed from total RNA. After initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, amplification was performed in 32 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for another 10 min. Amplification products were fractionated on 1% agarose gels from which selected DNA bands were purified. They were ligated directly into pGEM-T (Promega) and the plasmids used to transform into Escherichia coli DH5α cells. Plasmid DNA was purified for sequencing using the Qiagen QIAprep miniprep kit. Nucleotide sequences were determined using a Perkin Elmer ABI-377 DNA sequencer, and analyzed using the University of Wisconsin GCG software package (17Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). End-adapted cDNA was synthesized fromM. alpina poly(A)+ mRNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and ligated into theEcoRI site of λMOSSlox (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resultant DNA was packaged into phage particles to produce a library of 4×106 plaque-forming units with an average insert size of 1.4 kilobases. The library was screened by standard techniques (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar) using cloned PCR products as probes. DNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Ready To GoTM DNA labeling reaction mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The full-length cDNA clone L11.1 was purified by successive rounds of plating and hybridization before it was subjected to plasmid excision in vivo and the insert was sequenced on both strands. Aliquots (10 μg) of genomic DNA from M. alpina and M. circinelloides were digested with restriction enzymes and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA was transferred to a Zeta-Probe® nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) by alkaline capillary transfer for 5–8 h using 0.4 m NaOH as transfer buffer. To improve transfer of the larger DNA fragments (greater than 4 kilobases), the gel was soaked in 0.25 m HCl for 15 min to partially depurinate the DNA and then briefly rinsed in water prior to blotting. The filters were probed with the 660-bp fragment amplified between histidine boxes 1 and 3 using the gene-specific primers 5′-CATGATGCGTCTCACTTTTCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-(G/A)GGTGCACAGCCT GGTAGTT-3′ (reverse). Overnight hybridization was performed at 55 °C in 0.25 m sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 7% SDS, after which the filters were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at the hybridization temperature and x-ray film exposed to it at −80 °C using an intensifying screen (18Smith M.A. Stobart A.K. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PCR with the primers MYfor, 5′-GCGGGTACC ATGGGTACGGACCAAGGA-3′ (annealing to the initiating methionine indicated by the boldface type), and MYrev, 5′-GCGGAGCTC CTACTCTTCCTTGGGACG-3′ (annealing to the complement of the stop codon, indicated in boldface type) was used to amplify the pL11 coding region and to flank it with KpnI and SacI restriction sites. The amplified PCR product was ligated into the vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) to generate the plasmid pYES2/L11 and cloned in E. coli. The fidelity of the cloned PCR product was checked by in vitro transcription and translation using the TNTTM system (Promega). Translation products labeled with [35S]methionine were generated, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. The plasmid was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae DBY746 by the lithium acetate method (19Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar), and expression of the transgene was induced by the addition of galactose to 1% (w/v). The yeast culture medium was supplemented with 0.5 mm di-homo-γ-linolenic acid or 0.5 mmlinoleic acid in the presence of 1% tergitol as described by Napieret al. (20Napier J.A. Hey S.H. Lacey D.J. Shewry P.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Total fatty acids extracted from yeast cultures were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) of methyl esters. Lipids were transmethylated with 1 m HCl in methanol at 80 °C for 1 h, then fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were extracted in hexane. GC analysis of FAMEs was conducted using a Hewlett Packard 5880A Series gas chromatograph equipped with a 25 m × 0.32-mm RSL-500 BP bonded capillary column and a flame ionization detector. Fatty acids were identified by comparison with retention times of FAME standards (Sigma). Relative percentages of the fatty acids were estimated from peak areas. Arachidonic acid was identified by GC-MS using a Krats MS80RFA operating at an ionization voltage of 70 eV, with a scan range of 500–40 daltons. The strategy employed to obtain probes for M. alpina desaturase genes involved reverse transcriptase PCR with the degenerate primer sequences used to amplify a plant Δ6-desaturase gene (15Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Inosine was used at all positions of 4-base degeneracy to maximize the relative concentrations of individual primers within the degenerate mixtures. The forward primer mixture was designed to encode histidine box 1, and the reverse primer mixture encoded the complement of histidine box 3. Total RNA extracted from M. alpina was reverse-transcribed, and the cDNA product was used as a template in a PCR that yielded products of various sizes. Several PCR products were generated, and those of the expected length (600–700 bp) were isolated from a gel for cloning and sequencing. The DNA sequence of one of the clones (L11) predicted an open reading frame of 224 amino acids. It displayed some similarity to other membrane-bound desaturases, including the presence of the second characteristic histidine box (11Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of this PCR product with the corresponding region of known desaturases indicated the greatest similarity to the Δ6-desaturase from a cyanobacterium (21Reddy A.S. Nuccio M.L. Gross L.M. Thomas T.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), although the actual level of identity was low and less than 25%. Lipid analysis has shown that in cultures of M. alpina harvested after 48 h arachidonic acid comprises up to 25% of the total lipid. 2L. V. Michaelson, C. M. Lazarus, G. Griffiths, J. A. Napier, and A. K. Stobart, unpublished data. It was therefore considered possible that L11 could encode part of either a Δ6- or a Δ5-desaturase from M. alpina. To isolate a complete coding region corresponding to the L11 PCR product, the insert was used to probe a M. alpina cDNA library that had been constructed in λMOSSlox. A sample of the primary library containing 1.48 × 105 plaque-forming units was plated and screened for hybridization to L11. Fifteen individual phage plaques gave positive signals; they were cored out of the agar plates and eluted into SM buffer. The resultant phage suspensions were checked for the presence of desaturase-encoding cDNAs by PCR with the degenerate histidine box primers. Clone L11.1 was determined as having the longest insert in a PCR screen involving the histidine box 3 primer and vector arm (T7 and SP6) primers, and was purified by additional rounds of plating and hybridization screening. The plasmid pL11.1 was released from λ clone L11.1 by in vivo excision, and the cDNA insert was sequenced. The 1410-bp cDNA insert of clone pL11.1 includes a 1341-bp reading frame encoding 446 amino acids and a TAG stop codon. The coding region is flanked by 3 bp from the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA and the full 3′-untranslated region, followed by part of the poly(A) tail. Fig. 1 shows the deduced amino acid sequence of the predicted coding region. It shows 22% identity with the Δ6-desaturase from the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis (21Reddy A.S. Nuccio M.L. Gross L.M. Thomas T.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and 20% identity with the Borago officinalis (borage) Δ6-desaturase (15Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The three conserved histidine boxes that are characteristic of other membrane desaturases are present. The third histidine box contains a H → Q substitution, which is also evident in the B. officinalisand the Caenorhabditis elegans Δ6-desaturase sequences (15Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 20Napier J.A. Hey S.H. Lacey D.J. Shewry P.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A heme containing electron donor is required for fatty acid desaturation and cytochromeb 5 fulfils this function for the membrane-bound desaturases (5Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8Smith M.A. Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Griffiths W.T. Stymne S. Stobart A.K. Biochem.

Fig. 1 shows the presence of a heme binding region characterized by the H-P-G-G motif toward the N terminus and hence the cytochrome b 5 and desaturase may exist as a fusion protein. Previously identified fungal desaturases also contain cytochrome b 5 fusions, but with the heme-binding region located toward the C terminus (5Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Anamnart S. Tomita T. Fukui F. Fujimori K. Harashima S. Yamada Y. Oshima Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 184: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). M. circinelloides is a filamentous zygomycete, which accumulates a triacylglycerol oil rich in γ-linolenic acid but lacking arachidonic acid. In all other respects, it is very similar to M. alpina (6Jackson F.M. Fraser T.C.M. Smith M.A. Lazarus C. Stobart A.K. Griffiths G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It thus has genes encoding Δ9-, Δ12-, and Δ6-desaturase activities and is likely to lack a Δ5-desaturase gene. Genomic DNA was isolated fromM. alpina and M. circinelloides, digested with three restriction enzymes and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. A Southern blot of the gel was probed with the 660-bp fragment amplified by PCR between histidine boxes 1 and 3 of clone L11. Fig. 2 shows single hybridizing bands in each of the digests of M. alpina DNA, but no hybridization was observed to M. circinelloides DNA. In a similar experiment, a putative Δ9-desaturase cDNA was found to hybridize strongly to both the M. circinelloides genome as well as the M. alpina genome.2 These results indicate that the desaturase isolated from M. alpina is encoded by a single copy gene that is not present in M. circinelloides; this suggests that the gene is likely to encode a Δ5-desaturase rather than a Δ6-desaturase. The complete coding region (446 amino acids) of L11.1 was amplified by PCR and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 downstream of theGAL1 promoter. This construct was transformed into E. coli. The fidelity of the PCR-generated insert in plasmid pYES2/L11 was confirmed in vitro by coupled transcription/translation under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter in the vector. The translation products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A product of M r ∼56,000 was produced from the plasmid pYES2/L11, whereas the empty vector control (pYES2) failed to yield any protein products (data not shown). For functional analysis of the L11.1 coding region, the recombinant plasmid was transferred to yeast. Cells were cultured overnight in a medium containing raffinose as a carbon source, and supplemented by the addition of either linoleic acid (18:2 Δ9,12) or di-homo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3 Δ8,11,14). These fatty acids are not present in S. cerevisiae but serve as the specific substrates for either the Δ6- or Δ5-desaturase, respectively. Expression of the L11.1 coding region from the GAL1 promoter of the vector was induced by the addition of galactose to 1%. Growth of the cultures was continued for 16 h, when aliquots were removed for the analysis of fatty acids by GC. Fig. 3 shows the result of GC analysis of the fatty acid methyl esters of transformed yeast strains. An additional peak is apparent in the trace obtained from induced pYES2/L11 grown in the presence of di-homo-γ-linolenic acid compared with an empty vector control. This peak was also absent from uninduced cultures grown on di-homo-γ-linolenic acid and it is also important to note that pYES2/L11 grown in the presence of linoleic acid failed to accumulate any novel peaks indicating that this fatty acid is not a substrate for the enzyme encoded by the M. alpina cDNA. The retention time of the additional peak is identical to that of the authentic methyl-arachidonic acid standard. The fatty acid produced from di-homo-γ-linolenic acid was further characterized by GC-MS and identified as arachidonic acid (Fig. 4). The results show, therefore, that yeast cells transformed with the plasmid pYES2/L11 had acquired functional Δ5-desaturase activity and were now capable of synthesizing arachidonic acid from the substrate di-homo-γ-linolenic acid. The Δ5-desaturase in the transformed yeast appeared to be a very efficient catalyst, with 21.3% of the substrate converted to arachidonic acid under the conditions of the experiment.Figure 4GC-MS analysis of the novel peak identified in yeast carrying pYES2/L11. A comparison of the mass spectra of the novel peak (A) and an authentic arachidonic acid standard (B) is shown. Visual and computer-based inspection indicate that the two spectra are identical.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Data base searching with the M. alpina cDNA identified a high scoring match to one of the genes on C. elegans cosmid T13F2 (GenBank accession number Z81122). The C. elegans ORF of T13F2.1 predicts a protein of 454 amino acids. It contains the characteristics of other membrane-bound desaturases including the three histidine box domains. It also contains an N-terminal cytochromeb 5 region, and the third histidine box contains the H → Q variant. As the nematode performs Δ5desaturation (23Tanaka T. Ikita K. Ashida T. Motoyama Y. Yamaguchi Y. Satouchi K. Lipids. 1996; 31: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it is possible that this homologue encodes a Δ5-desaturase gene. A cDNA isolated from M. alpina has been characterized and found to encode a protein with three histidine box motifs indicative of a microsomal fatty acid desaturase (11Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The deduced protein sequence also contained the diagnostic features of a heme-binding cytochrome b 5 domain located toward the N terminus. Evidence that the L11.1 clone encodes a Δ5-desaturase was obtained by Southern blot analysis, which indicated the absence of homologous sequences in the genome ofM. circinelloides, a related fungus that produces γ-linolenic acid but not arachidonic acid. Functional analysis of the L11.1 clone in transformed yeast confirmed that it encoded a Δ5-desaturase gene, since cells growing in a medium supplemented with di-homo-γ-linolenic acid produced arachidonic acid in significant quantities. The fungal Δ5-desaturase appears to differ from the other fungal and plant desaturases that have been characterized (5Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Anamnart S. Tomita T. Fukui F. Fujimori K. Harashima S. Yamada Y. Oshima Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 184: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The most closely related sequence identified was that of the cyanobacterial Δ6-desaturase involved in GLA formation (21Reddy A.S. Nuccio M.L. Gross L.M. Thomas T.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), with which the fungal Δ5-desaturase showed only some 22% amino acid identity. Data base searches have also enabled us to identify a putative animal Δ5-desaturase in the nematode C. elegans. It is interesting that the Δ5-desaturase may exist as a cytochrome b 5 fusion protein. Such fusions have been identified in a hypothetical desaturase-like sunflower protein (24Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the Δ6-desaturase in B. officinalis, both of which contain N-terminal cytochrome b 5domains (15Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Δ9-Desaturases characterized from other fungi have also been found to contain cytochromeb 5 domains, but in these examples the diagnostic heme binding site was located toward the C terminus (5Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Anamnart S. Tomita T. Fukui F. Fujimori K. Harashima S. Yamada Y. Oshima Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 184: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Δ5-desaturase from M. alpina, therefore, appears to be the first fungal fatty acid desaturase described with an N-terminal cytochrome b 5 domain and in this respect is similar to the “front end” Δ6-desaturase of B. officinalis (15Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 25Napier J.A. Sayanova O. Stobart A.K. Shewry P.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 717-718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the Δ6-desaturase of C. elegans (20Napier J.A. Hey S.H. Lacey D.J. Shewry P.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast to other microsomal desaturases, the microsomal desaturases with N-terminal cytochrome b 5 domains use a polyunsaturated fatty acid as a substrate and insert a double bond between the methyl end of the fatty acid and existing double bonds, but it is unclear how significant a role the fused cytochromeb 5 region plays in this reaction. TheOLE1 gene isolated from S. cerevisiae, which encodes a Δ9-desaturase, contains a C-terminal cytochromeb 5 domain. OLE1 rescued double mutants deficient in both OLE1 and the separate microsomal cytochrome b 5. However, when the cytochromeb 5 region was deleted from this gene, the yeast cells remained fatty acid auxotrophs, even in the presence of the endogenous yeast cytochrome b 5 (5Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This suggests that the cytochrome b 5 domain plays an essential role in the desaturation reaction. Whether the cytochromeb 5-desaturase fusion proteins are more efficient awaits further assessment. Recently, another N-terminal cytochrome b 5fusion protein, Fah1p, has been identified in yeast; it is required for the α-hydroxylation of sphingolipid-associated very-long-chain fatty acids (26Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28281-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it contains two of the histidine box motifs characteristic of membrane-bound desaturases. TheArabidopsis homologue of Fah1p has no cytochromeb 5 domain but is able to functionally complement a fah1 deletion mutant. This indicates that, in the case of Fah1p, the N-terminal cytochrome b 5 may not be essential for function (26Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28281-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Desaturases isolated from fungal sources have much potential for further exploitation, particularly in the genetic manipulation of oil crops to produce novel and diverse polyunsaturated fatty acid products for the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries (27Gill I. Valivety R. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 470-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

Activation of this response is characterized by increased synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which protect cellular proteins from stress-induced denaturation. Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) are required for increased expression of HSPs during stress conditions and can be found in complexes containing components of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone machinery, raising the possibility that Hsp90 is involved in regulation of the heat shock response. To test this, we have assessed the effects of mutations that impair activity of the Hsp90 machinery on heat shock related events inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations that either reduce the level of Hsp90 protein or eliminate Cpr7, a CyP-40-type cyclophilin required for full Hsp90 function, resulted in increased HSF-dependent activities. Genetic tests also revealed that Hsp90 and Cpr7 function synergistically to repress gene expression from HSF-dependent promoters. Conditional loss of Hsp90 activity resulted in both increased HSF-dependent gene expression and acquisition of a thermotolerant phenotype.

All cells possess a defense mechanism known as the heat shock response, which allows them to survive exposure to otherwise lethal doses of certain stresses (1Craig E.A. Crit. Rev.

The heat shock response is characterized by increased synthesis of a set of proteins collectively referred to as heat shock proteins (HSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSF, heat shock transcription factor; HSE, heat shock element. 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSF, heat shock transcription factor; HSE, heat shock element. whose principal role is to assist target substrates in their synthesis, transport, and proper folding (5Parsell D.A.

The requirement for chaperoning activities increases as cells are exposed to elevated temperatures or to other conditions that promote protein denaturation and aggregation. Because chaperoning activity is also crucial for the function of proteins not exposed to stress, HSPs play important roles for life under normal conditions as well.Expression of HSPs is under the control of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopouloss C.

In most eukaryotic systems, HSF is maintained as a monomer unable to bind DNA until activated by stress (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopouloss C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones.

Activated HSF forms homotrimers capable of binding to heat shock elements (HSEs) present at promoters of genes encoding HSPs, ultimately leading to transcriptional activation (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopouloss C.

Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). The monomer to trimer transition is believed to be negatively regulated, at least in part, by Hsp70 (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopouloss C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones.

The acquisition of transcriptional activity by HSF is correlated with increased phosphorylation (10Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar); however, the functional relationship between phosphorylation and regulation of the heat shock response is still not fully understood.In contrast to most eukaryotic cells, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae HSF is bound to HSEs even in the absence of stress (11Jakobsen B.K. Pelham H.R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5040-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This observation led to the proposal that yeast HSF bypasses the monomer to trimer and DNA binding regulatory steps. However, subsequent work has shown that heat shock treatment leads to increased HSE occupancy by HSF at the yeast HSP82 promoter (12Giardina C. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that regulation of HSF activity in yeast is mediated in part by conversion of HSF from a non-DNA binding form to one competent to bind HSEs.Perhaps the best characterized aspect of HSF regulation in S. cerevisiae comes from investigation of the functional relationship between Hsp70 and the heat shock response. Mutations that decrease Hsp70 levels confer increased expression of several HSPs and constitutive thermotolerance (13Craig E.A. Jacobsen K. Cell. 1984; : 841-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these mutants exhibit a slow growth phenotype that can be suppressed by a mutation inHSF that decreases function of the transcription factor (15Halladay J.T. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4890-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These and other results from both mammalian and yeast systems, including the observation that the heat shock response is transient in nature, have led to the proposal for an autoregulatory loop in which Hsp70 normally represses HSF activity. According to this model, during heat shock Hsp70 dissociates from HSF, resulting in a net increase in synthesis of HSPs, including Hsp70 itself. Elevated levels of Hsp70 in turn lead to increased binding of the chaperone to HSF resulting in repression of HSF and subsequent down-regulation of the response (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopouloss C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones.

Gross C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar).In addition to Hsp70, other molecular chaperones have been proposed to be involved in the regulation of the heat shock response (9Sorger P.K. Cell. 1991; 65: 363-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that the mammalian cochaperone Hdj1 is involved in negative regulation of HSF1 activity (17Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Because yeast and mammalian HSF can physically associate with Hsp90 (18Nair S.C. Toran E.J. Rimerman R.A. Hjermstad S. Smithgall T.E. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; : 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar,19Nadeau K. Das A. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1479-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2S. Lindquist, personal communication. 2S. Lindquist, personal communication. it is possible that the Hsp90 machinery also participates in regulation of the heat shock response. Furthermore, because Hsp70 and Hsp90 can be found together in the same protein complexes (20Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar), some of the functions ascribed to Hsp70 in regulation of HSF activity may actually reflect a joint effect with Hsp90.Hsp90 associates with several proteins, including the cyclophilin CyP-40, to form heterocomplexes that regulate the activity of a number of cellular factors, such as steroid receptors and oncogenic tyrosine kinases (20Pratt W.B.

More recently, mammalian Hsp90 has been shown to associate with endothelial nitric oxide synthase and to facilitate activation of the synthase in response to different signals (22Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Although S. cerevisiae has been widely used to study the requirements for Hsp90 and Hsp90-associated proteins on activities of heterologous substrates (23Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 24Duina A.A. Chang H.-C.J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F.

A. 1993; 90: 7074-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), to date no endogenous role for Hsp90 has been identified in yeast. To test the possibility that the Hsp90 machinery is involved in regulation of the heat shock response, we have taken advantage of recently discovered mutations that significantly decrease the effectiveness of the Hsp90 machinery in S. cerevisiae and assessed their effects on HSF-dependent events. Our results show that Hsp90 and the yeast Cyp-40 homolog Cpr7 are required for negative regulation of the heat shock response in yeast.DISCUSSIONThe discovery that the yeast CyP-40 homolog Cpr7 is required for full Hsp90 activities in vivo (24Duina A.A. Chang H.-C.J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) provided us with a new genetic tool with which to analyze the role of the Hsp90 machinery in regulation of the heat shock response. Our results reveal that Cpr7 and Hsp90 negatively regulate HSF activity under both nonstress and stress conditions. The magnitude of increased expression of HSF-regulated genes in cpr7Δ cells showed that Cpr7 plays a major role in this regulation. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that Cpr7 and Hsp90 function to repress HSF-dependent gene expression in a synergistic manner, supporting the notion that the activities of Cpr7 and Hsp90 in regulation of the heat shock response are closely allied.Expression of HSF-responsive genes increases sharply when cells are exposed to environmental stresses. We have discovered that in Hsp90 mutant cells heat shock regimens that are normally sufficient to confer the maximal heat shock response result in the induction of HSF-dependent genes to levels significantly greater than those observed in wild-type cells under the same conditions. This suggests that even during heat shock Hsp90 functions to negatively regulate HSF activity.It is formally possible that increased expression of HSF-responsive genes in cells with reduced Hsp90 activity occurs through a mechanism independent of HSF. Because HSF is an essential gene in S. cerevisiae (10Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), this possibility can not be tested directly by assessing the effects of Hsp90 mutations in cells lacking HSF. However, the observation that three different HSF-responsive genes are each affected in a similar manner by mutations in Hsp90 and CPR7suggests that the increase in gene expression occurs via derepression of HSF activity. More importantly, the demonstration that an HSF-responsive reporter gene (HSE2::lacZ) that is made independent of HSF through point mutations that abolish HSF-binding (HSE12::lacZ) is no longer affected by Hsp90 mutations strongly supports the notion that Hsp90 and its associated proteins repress heat shock-related events by negatively regulating HSF activity.How might the Hsp90 machinery regulate HSF activity? It is possible that negative regulation of HSF by Hsp90 occurs independently of the ability to associate with each other. For example, Hsp90 could separately interact with and inhibit a positive regulator of the heat shock response upstream from HSF. Alternatively, consistent with proposals that protein denaturation can signal activation of the heat shock response (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopouloss C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones.

Cell. 1991; 65: 363-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), one or more proteins might induce the response simply by failing to achieve native conformations in the absence of the chaperone. This would raise the intriguing possibility that disruption of the interaction between Hsp90 and certain substrates is a specific mechanism by which cells sense stress. Such a signal would likely be mediated by one or a few key factors and not by a state of general protein denaturation, because recent results demonstrate that the in vivo substrates of Hsp90 are highly restricted (30Nathan D.F. Harju Vos M. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12949-12956Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Because Hsp90 can interact with HSF in both mammalian (18Nair S.C. Toran E.J. Rimerman R.A. Hjermstad S. Smithgall T.E. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; : 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and yeast cells (19Nadeau K. Das A. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1479-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),2 a particularly attractive model is one in which HSF is negatively regulated by physical association with Hsp90 under nonheat shock conditions. During heat shock, one or more components of the Hsp90 heterocomplex may dissociate from HSF in a temperature-dependent manner, thereby allowing HSF-mediated activation of transcription. Consistent with this proposal, Nairet al. (18Nair S.C. Toran E.J. Rimerman R.A. Hjermstad S. Smithgall T.E. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; : 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) have shown that the Hsp90-HSF1 interaction can be disrupted by moderately elevated temperatures. Regulation of HSF activity by the Hsp90 complex is reminiscent of the role postulated for Hsp70 in HSF regulation (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A.

Gross C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Whether Hsp70 and Hsp90 function independently in this regard is unknown. Nevertheless, the discovery that Hsp90 and a member of the CyP-40 class of cyclophilins are required for negative regulation of the heat shock response establishes the first specific endogenous role for these molecules in S. cerevisiae. All cells possess a defense mechanism known as the heat shock response, which allows them to survive exposure to otherwise lethal doses of certain stresses (1Craig E.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 18: 239-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 2Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These stresses include environmental challenges, such as elevated temperatures, and pathophysiological states, such as viral infections (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopouloss C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 417-456Google Scholar). The heat shock response is characterized by increased synthesis of a set of proteins collectively referred to as heat shock proteins (HSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSF, heat shock transcription factor; HSE, heat shock element. 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSF, heat shock transcription factor; HSE, heat shock element. whose principal role is to assist target substrates in their synthesis, transport, and proper folding (5Parsell D.A.

Weissman J.S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 365-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The requirement for chaperoning activities increases as cells are exposed to elevated temperatures or to other conditions that promote protein denaturation and aggregation. Because chaperoning activity is also crucial for the function of proteins not exposed to stress, HSPs play important roles for life under normal conditions as well. Expression of HSPs is under the control of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T.

In most eukaryotic systems, HSF is maintained as a monomer unable to bind DNA until activated by stress (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopouloss C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones.

Activated HSF forms homotrimers capable of binding to heat shock elements (HSEs) present at promoters of genes encoding HSPs, ultimately leading to transcriptional activation (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopouloss C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 417-456Google Scholar, 8Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). The monomer to trimer transition is believed to be negatively regulated, at least in part, by Hsp70 (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopouloss C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones.

The acquisition of transcriptional activity by HSF is correlated with increased phosphorylation (10Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar); however, the functional relationship between phosphorylation and regulation of the heat shock response is still not fully understood. In contrast to most eukaryotic cells, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae HSF is bound to HSEs even in the absence of stress (11Jakobsen B.K. Pelham H.R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5040-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This observation led to the proposal that yeast HSF bypasses the monomer to trimer and DNA binding regulatory steps. However, subsequent work has shown that heat shock treatment leads to increased HSE occupancy by HSF at the yeast HSP82 promoter (12Giardina C. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that regulation of HSF activity in yeast is mediated in part by conversion of HSF from a non-DNA binding form to one competent to bind HSEs. Perhaps the best characterized aspect of HSF regulation in S. cerevisiae comes from investigation of the functional relationship between Hsp70 and the heat shock response. Mutations that decrease Hsp70 levels confer increased expression of several HSPs and constitutive thermotolerance (13Craig E.A. Jacobsen K. Cell. 1984; : 841-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these mutants exhibit a slow growth phenotype that can be suppressed by a mutation inHSF that decreases function of the transcription factor (15Halladay J.T. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4890-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These and other results from both mammalian and yeast systems, including the observation that the heat shock response is transient in nature, have led to the proposal for an autoregulatory loop in which Hsp70 normally represses HSF activity. According to this model, during heat shock Hsp70 dissociates from HSF, resulting in a net increase in synthesis of HSPs, including Hsp70 itself. Elevated levels of Hsp70 in turn lead to increased binding of the chaperone to HSF resulting in repression of HSF and subsequent down-regulation of the response (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopouloss C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones.

Gross C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In addition to Hsp70, other molecular chaperones have been proposed to be involved in the regulation of the heat shock response (9Sorger P.K. Cell. 1991; 65: 363-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that the mammalian cochaperone Hdj1 is involved in negative regulation of HSF1 activity (17Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Because yeast and mammalian HSF can physically associate with Hsp90 (18Nair S.C. Toran E.J. Rimerman R.A. Hjermstad S. Smithgall T.E. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; : 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar,19Nadeau K. Das A. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1479-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2S. Lindquist, personal communication. 2S. Lindquist, personal communication. it is possible that the Hsp90 machinery also participates in regulation of the heat shock response. Furthermore, because Hsp70 and Hsp90 can be found together in the same protein complexes (20Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar), some of the functions ascribed to Hsp70 in regulation of HSF activity may actually reflect a joint effect with Hsp90. Hsp90 associates with several proteins, including the cyclophilin CyP-40, to form heterocomplexes that regulate the activity of a number of cellular factors, such as steroid receptors and oncogenic tyrosine kinases (20Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 21Brugge J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 123: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, mammalian Hsp90 has been shown to associate with endothelial nitric oxide synthase and to facilitate activation of the synthase in response to different signals (22Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Although S. cerevisiae has been widely used to study the requirements for Hsp90 and Hsp90-associated proteins on activities of heterologous substrates (23Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J.

To test the possibility that the Hsp90 machinery is involved in regulation of the heat shock response, we have taken advantage of recently discovered mutations that significantly decrease the effectiveness of the Hsp90 machinery in S. cerevisiae and assessed their effects on HSF-dependent events. Our results show that Hsp90 and the yeast Cyp-40 homolog Cpr7 are required for negative regulation of the heat shock response in yeast.

Harju Vos M. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12949-12956Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Because Hsp90 can interact with HSF in both mammalian (18Nair S.C. Toran E.J. Rimerman R.A. Hjermstad S. Smithgall T.E. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; : 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and yeast cells (19Nadeau K. Das A. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1479-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),2 a particularly attractive model is one in which HSF is negatively regulated by physical association with Hsp90 under nonheat shock conditions. During heat shock, one or more components of the Hsp90 heterocomplex may dissociate from HSF in a temperature-dependent manner, thereby allowing HSF-mediated activation of transcription. Consistent with this proposal, Nairet al. (18Nair S.C. Toran E.J. Rimerman R.A. Hjermstad S. Smithgall T.E. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; : 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) have shown that the Hsp90-HSF1 interaction can be disrupted by moderately elevated temperatures. Regulation of HSF activity by the Hsp90 complex is reminiscent of the role postulated for Hsp70 in HSF regulation (4Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A.

Gross C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Whether Hsp70 and Hsp90 function independently in this regard is unknown. Nevertheless, the discovery that Hsp90 and a member of the CyP-40 class of cyclophilins are required for negative regulation of the heat shock response establishes the first specific endogenous role for these molecules in S. cerevisiae.

Certain foods also contain the aminopentol backbone (AP1) that is formed upon base hydrolysis of the ester-linked tricarballylic acids of FB1. Both FB1 and, to a lesser extent, AP1 inhibit ceramide synthase due to structural similarities between fumonisins (as 1-deoxy-analogs of sphinganine) and sphingoid bases. To explore these structure-function relationships further, erythro- and threo-2-amino, 3-hydroxy- (and 3, 5-dihydroxy-) octadecanes were prepared by highly stereoselective syntheses. All of these analogs inhibit the acylation of sphingoid bases by ceramide synthase, and are themselves acylated with V max/K m of 40–125 for the erythro-isomers (compared with approximately 250 for d-erythro-sphinganine) and 4–6 for the threo-isomers. Ceramide synthase also acylates AP1 (but not FB1, under the conditions tested) to N-palmitoyl-AP1 (PAP1) with a V max/K m of approximately 1. The toxicity of PAP1 was evaluated using HT29 cells, a human colonic cell line. PAP1 was at least 10 times more toxic than FB1 or AP1 and caused sphinganine accumulation as an inhibitor of ceramide synthase. These studies demonstrate that: the 1-hydroxyl group is not required for sphingoid bases to be acylated; both erythro- andthreo-isomers are acylated with the highest apparentV max/K m for theerythro-analogs; and AP1 is acylated to PAP1, a new category of ceramide synthase inhibitor as well as a toxic metabolite that may play a role in the diseases caused by fumonisins.

Fumonisins are mycotoxins produced by Fusarium moniliforme (Sheldon) and related fungi that are common contaminants of maize and certain other foods (1Marasas W.F.O. Adv. Exp. Med.

Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 392: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Fumonisins are responsible for at least two diseases, equine leukoencephalomalacia and porcine pulmonary edema (5Kellerman T.S. Marasas W.F.O. Thiel P.G. Gelderblom W.C.A. Cawood M. Coetzer J.A.W. J.

Studies with these and other animals have uncovered a wide spectrum of toxicologic effects, which include hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, developmental toxicity, and immunosuppression (and immunostimulation under some conditions) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Marasas W.F.O.

Phytopathology. 1992; 82: 353-357Crossref Google Scholar). The diverse effects of these mycotoxins appear to be due to inhibition of ceramide synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the acylation of sphinganine, sphingosine, and other sphingoid bases (12Wang E.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and is manifested by up to several hundredfold increases in cellular levels of sphinganine (and sometimes other sphingoid bases) (8Riley R.T.

This elevation in sphinganine, a highly bioactive compound, initiates a cascade of cellular alterations that are thought to be largely responsible for the toxicity and carcinogenicity of this mycotoxin (7Merrill Jr., A.H.

Pharmacol. 1998; 148: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Removal of the tricarballylic acids groups from FB1 reduces the potency of inhibition of ceramide synthase by approximately 10-fold (13Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Gilchrist D.G. Riley R.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 215-234PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schmelz E.M. Dombrink-Kurtzman M.A. Kozutsumi Y. Merrill Jr., A.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 148: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This observation, plus the kinetic pattern for inhibition (20Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that ceramide synthase recognizes both the AP1 moiety (as a sphingoid base analog) and the tricarballylic acids side chains (presumably, as analogs of the phosphate groups of fatty acyl-CoA) (13Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Gilchrist D.G. Riley R.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 215-234PubMed Google Scholar). The toxicity of AP1 for cells in culture mirrors this reduced potency (19Schmelz E.M. Dombrink-Kurtzman M.A. Kozutsumi Y. Merrill Jr., A.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 148: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); however, feeding studies have found that AP1 causes hepatic and renal lesions in rats that are indistinguishable from those caused by FB1 (21Voss K.A. Bacon C.W. Meredith F.I. Norred W.P. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1996; 34: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Voss K.A. Riley R.T. Bacon C.W. Meredith F.I. Norred W.P. Environ. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 1998; 5: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which suggests that the mechanism(s) of action of AP1 versus FB1 are not yet fully understood. To characterize further the properties of the AP1 backbone, a series of 2-amino-3-hydroxy- (and 3, 5-dihydroxy-) octadecanes have been synthesized, and this report describes the somewhat unexpected finding that these analogs not only inhibit ceramide synthase but also serve as alternative substrates. Because these findings indicated that the aminopentol backbone of fumonisins may be acylated by ceramide synthase, the formation of N-palmitoyl-AP1(PAP1) was also characterized. Finally, PAP1was found to be highly toxic for HT29 cells, apparently as a new category of ceramide synthase inhibitor. The synthetic fumonisin and sphingoid base analogs were prepared by methods that will be described in another publication. 2For more information about these syntheses, consult the doctoral thesis of David S. Menaldino (UMI order no. AAI9328152; print index reference DAI 54-07B:3626) or contact Dr. D. C. Liotta. FB1was isolated from culture material, and AP1 was synthesized from FB1 by basic hydrolysis, as described by Wilsonet al. (23Wilson T.M. Ross P.F. Rice L.D. Osweiler G.D. Nelson H.A. Owens D.L. Plattner R.D. Reggiardo C. Noon T.H. Pickrell J.W. J. Vet. Diagn. Invest. 1990; 2: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled compounds were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ([1-14C]palmitoyl-coenzyme A) and NEN Life Science Products (d-erythro-[3-3H]sphingosine). For FAB-MS, a JMS-SX102SX102A/E five sector tandem mass spectrometer (JEOL, Peabody, MA) was used with NBA-Li as matrix. Electrospray analysis was performed on a triple stage quadrupole TSQ 7000 LC-MS/MS system (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany). HPLC/MS separations were carried out on a LiChrospher 60-RP select B column (100 × 2.0 mm inner diameter, 5 μm; Knauer, Berlin, Germany) using a linear water/acetonitrile gradient with 0.05% trifluoracetic acid. FB1 (1 mg, 1.38 μmol) and 4.4 mg of palmitic anhydride (6.92 μmol) were dissolved in 1 ml of methanol (MeOH):CHCl3 (1:1, v/v) and kept at room temperature for up to 48 h. The reaction was checked by TLC using silica 60 TLC plates (Merck, EM Separations, Gibbstown, NJ) and CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (90:20:0.5) as the developing solvent. To detect fumonisins, the plates were sprayed with a 0.5% p-anisaldehyde solution in MeOH:acetic acid:sulfuric acid (85:10:5), heated to 100 °C for 10 min, and visually examined. The clean-up was carried out by extraction with n-butanol as described for the ceramide synthase assay of FB1 (see below). Results: yield 40–50%; ES-MS: m/z 960.6 [M+H]+. AP1 (1.1 mg, 2.7 μmol) and 5.3 mg of palmitic anhydride (10.7 μmol) were dissolved in 1.5 ml of MeOH:CHCl3 (1:1) and kept at room temperature for up to 48 h. The reaction was checked by TLC as described above. The reaction mixture (0.5 ml) was applied to a SiO2 SPE column (500 mg capacity; Waters, Milford, MA), which was preconditioned with CHCl3. The minicolumn was washed with 6 ml of CHCl3 followed by 6 ml of CHCl3/MeOH (95:5). PAP1 was eluted with 6 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (95:10). Results: yield 70–80%; FAB-MS (NBA-Li-matrix):m/z 650.5 [M+Li]+, ES-MS:m/z 644.8 = [M+H]+. Ceramide synthase was assayed as described by Merrill and Wang (24Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by following either acylation of [3H]sphingosine to ceramide (for inhibition studies) or acylation of the sphingoid base analog using a radiolabeled fatty acyl-CoA. For the studies with FB1 or AP1, the reaction mixture (totalling 100 μL) contained 25 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA, varying concentrations of FB1 or AP1 (1–10 μm), and 150 μg of microsomal protein. The enzymatic reaction mixture was incubated in a shaking water bath for 15 min at 37 °C. In the case of AP1 as substrate, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of MeOH and 0.5 ml of CHCl3. For lipid extraction, 1 ml of CHCl3 and synthetic PAP1 (∼25 μg, as carrier) was added. The reaction mixture was vortexed, approximately 3 ml of slightly basic water was added, and the mixture was vortexed again. The CHCl3 layer was washed, dried, and evaporated as described above. In the case of FB1 as substrate, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of CHCl3, then, ∼25 μg of synthetic N-palmitoyl-FB1 was added as carrier, followed by 2 ml of slightly basic water. The reaction mixture was vortexed, centrifuged, and the CHCl3 layer was again washed with slightly basic water, dried, evaporated, and analyzed by TLC. The aqueous phase was acidified (to pH 4–5) by adding 0.1n HCl, and extracted two times with 1 ml ofn-butanol. The combined butanol layers were dried over Na2SO4, evaporated to dryness using a Speed Vac (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY) and analyzed by TLC. Samples were dissolved in MeOH:CHCl3 (1:2) and spotted onto type 60 silica TLC plates that were developed using CHCl3:MeOH (90:10, solvent 1) for PAP1, diethylether:MeOH (99:1, solvent 2) for ceramides, CHCl3:MeOH:H2O:acetic acid (90:20:0.5:1, solvent 3) for N-palmitoyl-FB1. After the plates were developed and air dried, the products were visualized by spraying with p-anisaldehyde solution, and the radiolabeled regions of the plate were detected using a Bioscan System 200 Image Scanner (Bioscan Inc., Washington, DC). The regions that migrated coincident with the standards were collected and counted using a detergent-containing scintillation mixture for 10 min in a Beckmann LS 7000 scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). HT29 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish (Corning, Cambridge, MA), and grown in 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 3.5 g/liter glucose, and 10 ml/liter of a solution of 6.1 mg/ml penicillin G and 10 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) in an incubator at 37 °C and a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The medium was changed 24 h after seeding, then the cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing PAP1 (solubilized in 10 μl of ethanol:dodecane, 98:2; addition of this volume of ethanol:dodecane had negligible effects on cell viability). After 24 h, the cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin in 0.05% EDTA, and viable cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion. To determine the effects of fumonisins on cellular sphinganine and ceramides, the cells were treated in the same manner, and the lipids were extracted and analyzed by HPLC as described by Schmelz et al. (19Schmelz E.M. Dombrink-Kurtzman M.A. Kozutsumi Y. Merrill Jr., A.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 148: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Analyses were conducted in triplicate unless otherwise noted, and the statistical significance of differences between groups was evaluated by the Student's t test using the InStat statistical package (GraphPad Software). The kinetic parameters were derived from linear regression analyses of the data. All of the fumonisin analogs inhibited the acylation ofd-erythro-[3H]sphingosine (Fig. 2), but were less potent than FB1. These results agree with the previous demonstration that FB1 is more potent than AP1 which, like these analogs, lacks the tricarballylic acid side chains (13Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Gilchrist D.G. Riley R.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 215-234PubMed Google Scholar). Upon more detailed analyses of the products of the assays, we discovered that the analogs also served as substrates; therefore, the kinetic parameters of acylation of these compounds were analyzed (Fig. 3). Of the six fumonisin analogs tested, XXa had the highest apparent V max, which was comparable with the naturally occurringd-erythro-sphinganine and -sphingosine (13Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Gilchrist D.G. Riley R.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 215-234PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nikolova-Karakashian M. Vales T.R. Wang E. Menaldino D.S. Alexander C. Goh J. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Hannun Y.A. Sphingolipid-Mediated Signal Transduction. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 159-172Crossref Google Scholar). Similarly, the other erythro- analogs (Va and XXb) were acylated reasonably well, and the threo- compounds (Vb, XIVa and XIVb) were also acylated, but with much lower apparentV max. Therefore, ceramide synthase does not require a 1-hydroxyl group on the sphingoid base substrate and as has been seen in analyses of the stereoisomers of sphingosine and sphinganine (25Nikolova-Karakashian M. Vales T.R. Wang E. Menaldino D.S. Alexander C. Goh J. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Hannun Y.A. Sphingolipid-Mediated Signal Transduction. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 159-172Crossref Google Scholar) will accommodate both threo- anderythro-stereoisomers, although the latter are better substrates. The ability of this enzyme to acylate these fumonisin analogs raised the possibility that FB1 or AP1might also be acylated, therefore, this was investigated.Figure 3Kinetic constants (apparent) for the utilization of sphinganine and various fumonisin analogs by ceramide synthase. K m is expressed in μm and V max in pmol/min/mg of microsomal protein for each of the compounds, R = C11H23.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since palmitoyl-CoA is one of the substrates utilized by ceramide synthase as well as widespread in nature, we used this fatty acid for the chemical and enzymatic syntheses. The N-palmitoyl-FB1 and PAP1 (Fig. 1) were characterized by FAB-MS and electrospray (ES)-MS analysis. The electrospray spectra ofN-palmitoyl-FB1 and PAP1 showed strong protonated molecular ions at m/z 960.6 [M+H]+ and m/z 644.8 [M+H]+, respectively, without further fragmentation. Using FAB-MS, only PAP1 gave a strong molecular ion atm/z 650.5 [M+Li]+. Since PAP1 is similar to natural ceramides in polarity, the products were extracted using CHCl3:MeOH (24Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); however,N-palmitoyl-FB1 bears two tricarballylic acids groups (with four charged carboxyl groups) and required a different extraction protocol. Briefly, the reaction mixture was extracted with CHCl3 to remove nonpolar lipids, then the aqueous phase was acidified with HCl and extracted withn-butanol to obtain N-palmitoyl-FB1(for details see “Experimental Procedures”). The success of the extraction was monitored by TLC and MS, and most of the carrierN-palmitoyl-FB1 was found in then-butanol layer (attempts to purifyN-palmitoyl-FB1 by other approaches, such as using reversed phase or anion exchange cartridges, were not successful). As shown in Fig. 4, incubation of rat liver microsomes with 10 μm AP1 and [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA produced a radiolabeled product that migrated at the same position on the chromatoplate (R f ∼0.2) as the reference PAP1(radiolabel was not found in this region of the chromatoplate when AP1 was omitted from the assay). Co-migration of this labeled product and the PAP1 standard on TLC was also obtained using several other solvent systems (not shown). To confirm that this product was PAP1, the assay mixture was extracted and the product analyzed by HPLC-ES-MS/MS using a reversed phase column and a water/acetonitrile gradient. We were able to detect the protonated molecular ion in the single ion monitoring mode atm/z 644.8 [M+H]+. Since only low amounts of PAP1 were produced in these enzymatic syntheses, we were not able to obtain daughter ion spectra; however, them/z 644.8 [M+H]+ signal showed the same HPLC retention time as the reference compound, which is strong evidence for the identity of this product. The concentration dependence for PAP1 formation fits a simple Michaelis-Menten relationship (Fig. 5). The apparent K mwas 3.4 μm and V max was 4.0 pmol/min/mg microsomal protein for AP1 (Fig. 5). Thus, theV max/K m for AP1is approximately 1, which is on the same order of magnitude as for thethreo-fumonisin analogs (Vb, XIVa and b). When 10 μm FB1 was incubated with rat liver microsomes and [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA, no radiolabel was detected in the region of the N-palmitoyl-FB1standard, therefore, FB1 was not acylated under these assay conditions. To determine whether PAP1 is cytotoxic, this compound was incubated with HT29 cells, a human colonic cell line that is sensitive to FB1 and AP1 (19Schmelz E.M. Dombrink-Kurtzman M.A. Kozutsumi Y. Merrill Jr., A.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 148: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). All of the tested concentrations of PAP1 (1–50 μm) caused a significant reduction in the number of viable cells within 24 h (cell death was noted as early as 4 h after addition of 50 μm PAP1) (Fig. 6). In other studies (19Schmelz E.M. Dombrink-Kurtzman M.A. Kozutsumi Y. Merrill Jr., A.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 148: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we have shown that 50 μm FB1 and AP1 reduced cell number by 50 and 32%, respectively, after 24 h. 3To determine whether the presence of the carrier solvents (ethanol:dodecane, 98:2) might have enhanced the toxicity of PAP1, this solvent mixture was also added to cells incubated with FB1. Under these conditions, 50 μm FB1 reduced the cell number by 37 ± 2%, which was not greater than the reduction by FB1alone. Therefore, PAP1 appears to be considerably more toxic for HT29 cells than either of the parent fumonisin precursors. Since the toxicity of fumonisins has been associated with the accumulation of sphinganine, the effects of PAP1 on free sphinganine and ceramide were determined (Fig. 7). The elevation in sphinganine induced by 1 μm PAP1 (17-fold versus the no fumonisin control) was the same as that for 50 μmAP1, and the elevation induced by 5 μmPAP1 (148-fold versus the no fumonisin control) was approximately twice the fold increase induced by 50 μm FB1 (68-fold). None of these treatments altered the ceramide levels of the cells over this period (Fig. 7), which is consistent with the sphinganine accumulation arising from inhibition of ceramide synthase, rather than activation of a ceramidase. As predicted by these findings with HT29 cells, PAP1 (and the N-palmitoyl derivative of the synthetic analog that most resembles AP1, XIVa) inhibited ceramide synthase in vitro, as shown in Fig. 8. Both caused ∼50% inhibition at ∼9 μm; for comparison, FB1 caused 50% inhibition at 6 μm in parallel assays conducted with this enzyme preparation and reagents (data not shown). The inhibition of ceramide synthase by FB1 and other fumonisins has been attributed, in large part, to similarities between the AP1 and the sphingoid base substrates for this enzyme (1Marasas W.F.O. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 392: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 7Merrill Jr., A.H. Liotta D.C. Riley R.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, this analogy is not fully convincing because AP1 differs from natural sphingoid bases in ways that are often important to enzyme-ligand interactions, namely the stereochemistry in the vicinity of the group to be modified (i.e. the 2-amino and 3-hydroxyl groups are threofor fumonisins and erythro for sphingoid bases), the absence of a hydroxyl group at position 1 (which might be important in binding, or orientation of the amino group for acylation), and the presence of an additional hydroxyl at position 5 (which might impose bulk or polarity in a key region of the enzyme active site). The structure-function analyses presented in this report alleviate these concerns by establishing that both erythro- andthreo- 1-deoxy, 5-hydroxy-sphinganines inhibit ceramide synthase and serve as reasonably good substrates. These findings extend the recent evaluation of the stereoisomers of sphinganine and sphingosine as substrates for ceramide synthase (25Nikolova-Karakashian M. Vales T.R. Wang E. Menaldino D.S. Alexander C. Goh J. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Hannun Y.A. Sphingolipid-Mediated Signal Transduction. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 159-172Crossref Google Scholar), which ranked the stereoisomers (based on the apparentV max/K m):d-erythro-(2S,3R) >d-threo-(2R,3R) >l-threo-(2S,3S) >l-erythro-(2R,3S). TheV max/K m only differed by approximately 20-fold for naturally occurringd-erythro-sphinganineversus l-threo-sphinganine 4This should be borne in mind whenl-threo-sphinganine is added to cells to inhibit sphingosine kinase because this treatment will lead to formation of thel-threo-(dihydro)ceramides, which may disrupt other aspects of sphingolipid metabolism and signaling. (Fig. 3) and arose from a 5-fold higher V max and a 4-fold lower K m. These results also agree with a much earlier finding by Stoffel and Bister (26Stoffel W. Bister K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that radiolabeled ceramides can be found in rat liver after intravenous injection of any of the radiolabeled stereoisomers of sphinganine. The reason(s) for this tolerance of multiple structural modifications are not known, 5More detailed mechanistic studies are not possible until this enzyme has been purified and can be characterized under more defined conditions. but a less restricted binding site might allow ceramide synthase(s) to accommodate the many different types of sphingoid bases that are found in nature (27Karlsson K.-A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 878-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because of this low degree of specificity, however, future studies should explore whether ceramide synthase can acylate other hydrophobic amines, including pharmaceuticals and toxins. Compounds of particular interest are AP1 and FB1, which are known inhibitors of ceramide synthase (13Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Gilchrist D.G. Riley R.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 215-234PubMed Google Scholar) but have not been analyzed as possible substrates. The acylation of AP1 was similar to that for the threo-analogs; however, FB1 was not detectably acylated, which is consistent with our suggestion (13Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Gilchrist D.G. Riley R.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 215-234PubMed Google Scholar, 20Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the tricarballylic acid side chains of FB1 occupy the acyl-CoA binding site and thereby block access of this co-substrate. A somewhat unexpected finding of this study was that PAP1is highly cytotoxic, apparently as an inhibitor of ceramide synthase. This inhibition by N-acyl,1-deoxysphinganines represents a new category of ceramide synthase inhibitor. Thus, PAP1causes an increase in cellular sphinganine, which is cytotoxic for many cell types (29Krauss G.A. Applegate J.M. Reynolds D. J. Agric.

Dombrink-Kurtzman M.A. Kozutsumi Y. Merrill Jr., A.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 148: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although PAP1 might also be toxic as a ceramide analog because ceramides can induce apoptosis, this probably does not play a role in the toxicity of PAP1 because the effects of N-acylsphingosines (ceramides) are usually stereoselective and require the 4,5-trans-double bond of the sphingosine backbone (28Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D.C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Feeding AP1 to rats causes lesions in liver and kidney that are indistinguishable from those caused by FB1 (21Voss K.A. Bacon C.W. Meredith F.I. Norred W.P. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1996; 34: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the organ-specific effects of feeding nixtamalized Fusarium moniliforme culture material (which contains AP1) to rats are similar to those of the diet prepared from untreated (FB1-containing) culture material (21Voss K.A. Bacon C.W. Meredith F.I. Norred W.P. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1996; 34: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). AP1also appears to have the same liver cancer promoting activity as FB1 (34Hendrich S. Miller K.A. Wilson T.M. Murphy P.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1993; 41: 1649-1654Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Heretofore, these in vivo effects of AP1 have been somewhat puzzling because AP1 is less potent than FB1 as an inhibitor of ceramide synthasein vitro (13Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Gilchrist D.G. Riley R.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 215-234PubMed Google Scholar); however, if AP1 is converted to an even more potent metabolite (PAP1), this could account for this discrepancy. Further evidence for a similar mechanism of action of FB1 and AP1 is the close correlation between the toxicity of FB1 or AP1 for rats and elevations in sphinganine (22Voss K.A. Riley R.T. Bacon C.W. Meredith F.I. Norred W.P. Environ. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 1998; 5: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The toxicity of FB1, AP1 (19Schmelz E.M. Dombrink-Kurtzman M.A. Kozutsumi Y. Merrill Jr., A.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 148: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and PAP1 for HT29 cells, an intestinal cell line, implies that consumption of fumonisins may affect the gastrointestinal tract since a substantial portion of an administered dose is found in intestinal epithelial cells (35Shephard G.S. Thiel P.G. Sydenham E.W. Alberts J.F. Gelderblom W.C.A. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), excreta, bile, and gut contents as FB1, partially hydrolyzed FB1 and AP1 (36Shephard G.S. Thiel P.G. Sydenham E.W. Savard M.E. Nat. Toxins. 1995; 3: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Little is known about the intestinal uptake and fate of AP1; however, sphingoid bases are rapidly taken up by intestinal cells (37Schmelz E.-M. Crall K.J. LaRocque R. Dillehay D.L. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar); therefore, it is likely that AP1 is taken up and converted to PAP1. This scenario might explain the recent report that human consumption of moldy maize (containing fumonisins) resulted in abdominal pain, borborygmi, and diarrhea (38Bhat R.V. Shetty P.H. Amruth R.P. Sundershan R.V. J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. 1997; 35: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The authors thank M. Herderich for assistance with some of the MS analyses, R. T.

https://openalex.org/W2057593147,"Protein phosphatases are involved in many cellular processes. One of the most abundant of these enzymes, the serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A), is present in most eukaryotic cells and serves a variety of functions. However, the detailed study of its regulation and function has been hampered by the difficulty of manipulating its expression level in cell culture. By using a new mammalian expression vector to forcibly overexpress PP2A in the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3, we now show that the catalytic subunit of PP2A is subject to a potent autoregulatory mechanism that adjusts PP2A protein to constant levels. This control is exerted at the translational level and does not involve regulation of transcription or RNA processing. Thus, our results demonstrate tight control of PP2A expression, and provide an explanation for the difficulty of increasing PP2A expression experimentally."

It is reasonable to suppose that cell surface cholesterol moves to the lysosomes, given the massive internalization of the plasma membrane bilayer through the endocytic pathway (25Thilo L. Biochim.

A circuit of cholesterol between the cell surface and lysosomal compartments could provide a regulated link that apportions cholesterol between these two pools. However, such a system has not been documented. We now present evidence for a brisk circulation of cholesterol between lysosomes and plasma membranes. In addition, our results suggest that the standing pool of lysosomal cholesterol in normal and cholesterol-enriched fibroblasts is derived primarily from the plasma membrane and may be regulated. Human foreskin fibroblasts were obtained as described (27Echevarria F. Norton R.A. Nes W.D. Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8484-8489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NPC fibroblasts were the generous gift of Dr. Peter Pentchev (National Institutes of Health). We used NPC line 93.59 here; where tested, the findings were confirmed with line 31.23. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal serum plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. To deplete their cholesterol, cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 5% LPDS for 24 h (28Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15102-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For the uptake of labeled lipoproteins, the serum in the medium was replaced with 5% LPDS. [3H]LDL was added to 40–100 μg of protein/ml, and the cells were incubated, as indicated, either at 37 °C (allowing lysosomal digestion to proceed) or at room temperature, causing ingested LDL to accumulate in a predigestive compartment (15Johnson W.J.

To analyze the relationship between the lysosomal and plasma membrane compartments, we followed the intracellular distribution and movement of cholesterol in normal human fibroblasts, which contain little lysosomal cholesterol, and in two perturbed fibroblast systems with increased lysosomal cholesterol. One of the perturbed systems was fibroblasts cultured from patients with NPC disease (21Pentchev P.G. Brady R.O. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Vanier M.T. Carstea E.D. Parker C.C. Goldin E. Roff C.F.

We found that the buoyant density distribution of the plasma membranes and normal (dense) lysosomes overlapped on sucrose density gradients (e.g. Fig. 1), while the buoyant density distribution of the plasma membranes and perturbed (buoyant) lysosomes overlapped on Percoll gradients (e.g.Figs. 4 and 5). However, a judicious choice of gradients allowed us to resolve these membranes in the experiments described below.Figure 4Buoyant density profile of lysosomes from cells treated with U18666A and oxysterols. In two separate experiments, replicate flasks of fibroblasts were incubated for 41 h in medium containing 10% serum with these additions: none (A); 5 μm U18666A (B); 20 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol (•) or 15 μg/ml 7-ketocholesterol (○) (C); 5 μm U18666A plus either 20 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol (•) or 15 μg/ml 7-ketocholesterol (○) (D). The cells were homogenized, fractionated on Percoll gradients, and assayed for the distribution of acid β-galactosidase. The cholesterol contents of the cells (μg/mg of protein) inA–D were, respectively, 37.3, 85.0, 33.0, and 41.6 for the experiment with 25-hydroxycholesterol and 43.8, 88.1, 27.2, and 36.1 for the experiment with 7-ketocholesterol. Note that unusually high levels of oxysterols used in these experiments were used to assure the full reversal of the strong effects of saturating levels of U18666A; however, 5 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol had an effect similar to that shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Transfer of [3H]cholesterol from lysosomes to plasma membranes in cells treated with U18666A.Fibroblasts were incubated for 15 h in medium containing 10% serum plus 0 (A and B) or 5 μmU18666A (C and D). The cells were rinsed and then incubated at 22 °C for 2 h in medium containing 5% LPDS, [3H]LDL (65 μg/ml protein), and 0 or 5 μmU18666A. Finally, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in medium containing 10% serum with or without 5 μmU18666A. Homogenates were analyzed on Percoll gradients for acid β-galactosidase (▴), cholesterol mass (○), and [3H]cholesterol (•).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Virtually all of the cholesterol in the control fibroblasts equilibrated on density gradients as a unimodal peak at ∼35% sucrose, congruent with the plasma membrane marker, 5′-nucleotidase (Fig. 1; see also Ref. 30Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15592-15597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysosomes, represented by acid (β-galactosidase, were typically found in a broader and somewhat denser peak, which overlapped the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). Prolonged treatment of fibroblasts with several class 2 amphiphiles caused their cell cholesterol to increase up to 2-fold (TableI; see also Ref. 17Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A large and variable fraction of this cholesterol was recovered in a novel peak at ∼18% sucrose (e.g. Fig. 2 A). This buoyant peak was not associated with plasma membrane or Golgi markers (5′-nucleotidase and galactosyltransferase) but rather with acid β-galactosidase and [3H]cholesterol from ingested LDL (Fig. 2). Similar effects were seen with the following class 2 amphiphiles: 0.5 μm monensin; 3 μm nigericin; 5 μm U18666A; 10 μm progesterone; 10 μm trifluoperazine; and 50 μm imipramine (not shown). We take the buoyant peak to contain lysosomes, the composition (and hence buoyancy) of which has been perturbed by the amphiphiles.Table ICholesterol in fibroblasts treated with amphiphilesAgentConcentratinCholesterolμmμg/mg proteinNone042.6U18666A590.8Progesterone1050.3Trifluoperazine1555.4Imipramine2579.7Fibroblasts in replicate flasks were maintained for 60 h in growth medium containing the indicated amphiphiles and then extracted for analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab Fibroblasts in replicate flasks were maintained for 60 h in growth medium containing the indicated amphiphiles and then extracted for analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data represent duplicate assays on duplicate flasks that agreed to <2%. The accumulation of cholesterol in dense lysosomes, resolved from plasma membranes on Percoll gradients (see below), commenced immediately upon treatment of cells with class 2 amphiphiles and proceeded at a constant uptake rate of 0.8% of total cell cholesterol per h (S.D. = 0.3% per h; n = 13; range = 0.4–1.3). The buoyant lysosome population did not appear until after 1 day of treatment. The β-galactosidase activity was never found at an intermediate buoyant density, suggesting that the two populations of lysosomes might be discrete and different. These results corroborate earlier reports that excess cholesterol accumulates in the lumen of lysosomes in cells treated with certain amphiphiles (20Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F. Patterson M.C. Patel S. Comly M.E. Cooney A. Vanier M. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), conferring unusual lysosomal buoyancy. While many of the class 2 amphiphiles are weak bases, their effect on cholesterol accumulation was probably not related to the discharge of lysosomal pH. First, progesterone and other agents that induce lipidosis are not known to be acidotropic (33Hruban Z. Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 55: 53-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Second, none of the agents we tested reduced the punctate pattern of lysosome staining by the acidotropic fluorescent dye, acridine orange (37Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been observed that perturbing lysosomal acidification in fibroblasts with the lysosomotropic class 2 amphiphile, chloroquine, stimulated the redistribution of lysosomal membrane markers to the plasma membrane (38Lippincott-Schwartz J. Fambrough D.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), an effect opposite to that seen here for cholesterol. When fibroblasts were incubated with U18666A in medium containing 5% LPDS rather than 10% whole serum, their lysosomes still shifted to a more buoyant density (Fig. 3 A) and accumulated extra cholesterol (Fig. 3 B). While these effects were less striking than those seen in the presence of 10% whole serum (Fig. 2), they nevertheless suggest that lysosomes might receive cholesterol from a source other than ingested LDL. Most of the lysosomes from normal cells were dense in Percoll gradients (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of cells with U18666A for more than 1 day shifted most of the lysosomes from the dense to the buoyant region (Fig. 4 B). This effect was reversible. For example, two-thirds of the large buoyant peak of acid β-galactosidase that formed in fibroblasts incubated with imipramine for 40 h disappeared during a subsequent overnight incubation without the agent (not shown). Two oxysterols, 25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol, abolished the buoyant peak of lysosomes both in normal cells (Fig. 4, compareA and C) and in cells treated with U18666A (Fig. 4, compare B and D). U18666A by itself caused the cell cholesterol to double (see the Fig. 4 legend and Table I); the oxysterols reversed this accumulation and also caused a slight diminution of the cholesterol content of the control cells. We infer that class 2 amphiphiles and oxysterols have opposing effects on cholesterol accumulation and, consequently, on lysosomal buoyancy. These findings bear on three other issues. First, they support the premise that the action of the class 2 amphiphiles on the lysosomes is unrelated to their lumenal pH, upon which oxysterols are not known to act. Second, they support the hypothesis (14Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29371-29374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that oxysterols stimulate the movement of cholesterol between membranes, in opposition to class 2 agents, rather than acting exclusively upon homeostatic proteins in the ER (39Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4549) Google Scholar). Finally, they suggest that oxysterols might also be found to reverse the accumulation of cholesterol in the trans-Golgi membranes and the lysosomes of NPC cells (19Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Rousson R. Bonnet J. Pentchev P.G. Louisot P. Vanier M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and perhaps in naturally occurring lamellar bodies (see below). Fibroblasts were preincubated for 15 h with U18666A to build their pool of lysosomal cholesterol; they were then allowed to accumulate LDL labeled with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate in endocytic compartments for 2 h at 22 °C (6Lange Y. Ye J. Chin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17018-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Johnson W.J. Chacko G.K. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5546-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); finally, they were chased for 1 h at 37 °C. During the chase, free [3H]cholesterol was liberated from LDL in the lysosomes from whence it moved to the plasma membrane. In control experiments, we found that limiting the duration of the amphiphile pretreatment to less than 20 h avoided the formation of buoyant lysosomes (compare Fig. 5, A and C, with Fig. 4 B), so that Percoll gradient centrifugation cleanly separated plasma membranes from lysosomes. It was also established that, in the absence of a chase, only a small fraction of the free [3H]cholesterol was present in the region of Percoll gradients containing the plasma membrane. In three experiments such as that shown in Fig. 5 B, 60% (S.D. = 2%; range = 59–62%) of the free [3H]cholesterol liberated from the labeled LDL ingested by untreated cells reached the plasma membrane after a 1-h chase. Similar transport rates were reported previously (15Johnson W.J. Chacko G.K. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5546-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Brasaemle D.L. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 103-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liscum L. Faust J.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In two experiments in which cells were preincubated with U18666A for 14–15 h, 40 and 38% of the lysosomal [3H]cholesterol moved to the plasma membrane in the 1-h chase, as illustrated in Fig. 5 D. Two earlier studies also showed modest inhibition of lysosomal export by treatment with U18666A (17Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), while another indicated no reduction of the egress of lysosomal [3H]cholesterol after a short preincubation with class 2 agents (6Lange Y. Ye J. Chin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17018-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Values obtained in this way are likely to underestimate the rate of cholesterol transport, because the lysosomal probe is replenished by ongoing hydrolysis of the [3H]cholesterol ester precursor during the 1-h chase period. In addition, the true value for cholesterol efflux should take into account the unlabeled lysosomal cholesterol mass with which, we assume, the ingested [3H]cholesterol probe mixes completely. From measured radioactivity and pool sizes, we determined that, in three experiments like that in Fig. 5, 11 ± 3% and 10 ± 2% of total cell cholesterol left the lysosomes of control and U18666A-treated cells, respectively, in a 1-h incubation. We conclude therefore that the lysosomes in cells treated for ∼15 h with U18666A exhibited no significant reduction of their absolute capacity to export cholesterol despite a moderate decrease in their fractional rate of transport. It follows from these observations that lysosomal cholesterol export can appear to be inhibited by amphiphiles simply because of the isotope dilution of the ingested probe in the expanded lysosomal cholesterol pool. Exogenous pulses of [3H]cholesterol were introduced into the surfaces of fibroblasts (11Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As determined by Percoll gradient centrifugation of normal control cells, 4.7% of the probe moved from plasma membranes to lysosomes during a 1-h chase (S.D. = 2.3%; n = 6; range = 2.9–9.1%). Similar kinetics were observed in cells pretreated with U18666A for 5–16 h;"

The mucus layer on the epithelial surface of the mucous membrane is mainly made up of water and the gel-forming components, the mucus glycoproteins, or mucins, consisting of more than 50%O-linked oligosaccharides (1Strous G.J.

Raven Press, New York1994: 1255-1283Google Scholar). The peptide chain of mucins has domains with a high abundance of Ser, Thr, and Pro, usually in repetitive sequences (tandem repeats). The oligosaccharide chains are O-linked to Ser and Thr, thereby forming highly glycosylated domains or mucin domains. The apoprotein of the human intestinal MUC2 mucin, which is fully sequenced, contains two mucin domains with large amounts of the amino acids Thr, Pro, and Ser (3Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W.

The mucin domains are flanked by Cys-rich domains; one C-terminal, one N-terminal, and one central domain. The carboxyl and amino termini of the human MUC2 mucin and the blood coagulation factor, the von Willebrand factor (vWF), 1The abbreviations used are: vWF, von Willebrand factor; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: vWF, von Willebrand factor; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. show sequence similarities in the positions of the cysteines. The vWF forms disulfide-bonded dimers between two C termini, and the N termini mediate further oligomerization (5Ruggeri Z.M. Ware J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We have earlier shown that the human MUC2 apomucin forms dimers before being O-glycosylated (6Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To study the initial assembly of the human MUC2 mucin in more detail, pulse-chase labeling and subcellular fractionation has been performed on LS 174T cells. An early dimerization was observed in the endoplasmic reticulum; there was no further oligomerization, and the dimerization was followed by O-glycosylation of the mono- and dimer in the Golgi apparatus. Tunicamycin treatment slowed down the dimerization rate, introduced formation of putative tri- and tetramers, and prevented transfer of the apomucin into the Golgi apparatus. A rabbit antiserum α-MUC2TR (PH1900), against a synthetic peptide based on the tandem repeat region of the human MUC2 apoprotein, was raised (6Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The rabbit antiserum, PH1491 (later referred to as α-MUC2N3), prepared against a synthetic peptide (CPKDRPIYEEDLKK) based on amino acids 1167–1180 on the N terminus of the human MUC2 apoprotein was prepared as follows. A New Zealand White rabbit was immunized once with 500 μg of peptide conjugated to 400 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin in Freund's complete adjuvant and then twice with 250 μg of peptide conjugated to 200 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The specificity of the α-MUC2N3 antiserum was tested by inhibition with the immunizing peptide. First, the optimum concentration for inhibition was tested by inhibiting binding to the immobilized peptide as described previously (6Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). One mg of specific and nonrelevant peptide/25 μl of antiserum was used for inhibiting immunoprecipitation, performed as described below. The colon adenocarcinoma cell line LS 174T (ATCC CL 188) was cultured as described (6Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a concentration of about 50 × 106 cell/28-cm2 Petri dish the day before labeling. Cells were preincubated in methionine-free medium for 1 h followed by radiolabeling with 150 μCi 35S methionine (Redivue Promix [35S] labeling mix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)/dish. When cells were pulse-labeled for 2 min, 500 μCi of labeling mix/dish was added. In pulse-chase experiments cells were chased with culture medium supplemented by 15 μg of Met/ml of medium and 25 μg of Cys/ml of medium. Cells were washed and lysed as described (6Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), with the addition of 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in the lysis buffer. Inhibition ofN-glycosylation was performed by incubating cells in 20 μg of tunicamycin (Calbiochem)/ml of methionine-free medium 1 h prior to labeling, as well as during pulse and chase. Cells were washed twice with 5 ml of 250 mm sucrose and twice in 5 ml 50 mmsucrose. Cells were harvested in 500 μl of 50 mm sucrose including protease inhibitors (110 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 60 μg/ml leupeptin, 3.8 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I) using a cell scraper. The cell suspension was homogenized with 15 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer using a tight pestle, and the sucrose concentration was adjusted to 250 mm followed by an additional 5 homogenization strokes. Washing and homogenization were performed on ice. The homogenized suspension was centrifuged in a microtube at 4200 rpm and +4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was recovered. The cell pellet was washed twice in 250 μl of 250 mm sucrose, and all supernatants were pooled and carefully placed on a sucrose gradient in a centrifuge tube containing a 4-ml gradient of 35–50% sucrose on top of a 400-μl 65% sucrose cushion. All sucrose solutions used contained 3 mm imidazole and were at pH 7.4. Ultracentrifugation was performed 50,000 rpm at 12 °C for 3 h in a Beckman vertical rotor (Vti, 65.2). Fractions were collected from the bottom. Phosphate-buffered saline was added to a final volume of 1.2 ml, and 300 μl of lysate buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 750 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) Triton X-100), including protease inhibitors (as above) and 5 mm NEM, was added. Samples were sonicated three times for 2 s each (intensity 15) on a MSE Soniprep 100. The fractions collected were analyzed for NADPH cytochrome c reductase activity and galactosyltransferase activity (7Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Thorlin T. Bondjers G. Wiklund O.

Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (6Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem.

Immunoprecipitated samples were washed and incubated in 100 μl of 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1% SDS and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were centrifuged, and the SDS concentration in the supernatant was adjusted to 0.1% with 0.2 m phosphate buffer. N-Octylglycoside was added at an amount 10-fold greater than the amount of SDS followed by the addition of 2 units of PNGase F (Boehringer Mannheim). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 h, and iodoacetamide was added at an amount 2.5-fold greater than the amount of dithiothreitol, followed by incubation for 30 min in the dark. Samples were then reimmunoprecipitated with the α-MUC2TR antisera as described above. Immunoprecipitated samples were dissolved in nonreducing or reducing sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min as described (6Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem.

Samples were analyzed on SDS-agarose gels using 0.8% stacking gel of SeaKem Gold (FMC) and a separation gel of 1.3% Ultrapure agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1.3% Sea Plaque agarose (FMC) or 2% Ultrapure agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). Electrophoresis was performed at 10 mA for 18 h using a discontinuous buffer system (6Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem.

Gels were fixed in 30% ethanol and 10% acetic acid, incubated in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed to film at −70 °C as described (6Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed by analyzing the first dimension under nonreducing conditions. The lane was cut out, and the strip was incubated for 30 min in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, 0.4% SDS, pH 6.8, containing 50 mm dithiothreitol and then placed on top of another gel. The strip was overlaid with 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. Metabolically labeled LS 174T cells were immunoprecipitated with the α-MUC2TR antiserum, and samples were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% SDS at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were layered on top of a 5-ml linear 10–40% (w/w) sucrose gradient containing 0.1% SDS. Ultracentrifugation was performed at 50,000 rpm at 20 °C for 14 h in a Beckman swing-out rotor (SW 55 Ti). Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed by 3–5% SDS-PAGE. McA-RH7777 cells expressing apoB-100 (512 kDa) and apoB-48 (246 kDa) or the recombinant apoB-80 (410 kDa), apoB-72 (369 kDa), and apoB-53 (271 kDa) were metabolically labeled, and the cell supernatants were collected, immunoprecipitated with an α-apoB antiserum, subjected to rate zonal ultracentrifugation as described above, and analyzed by 3–15% PAGE (10Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yao Z.M. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylo S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficients for the MUC2 mono- and dimer and apoB-variants were estimated according to the method of McEwen (12McEwen C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 114-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). By immunoprecipitation of LS 174T cells using the α-MUC2TR antiserum directed against the large tandem repeat of the MUC2 mucin, we have shown that the human MUC2 apomucin forms a disulfide-stabilized oligomer that is interpreted as a dimer (6Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To confirm that the oligomeric species was a dimer, sedimentation of immunoprecipitated mono- and dimers were analyzed by rate zonal ultracentrifugation. The gradient was recovered form the bottom of the tube into 34 fractions, the sucrose concentration was measured, and each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The intensity of the mono- and dimer bands was estimated by densitometry and plotted in Fig. 1. The monomer banded at 29% sucrose, and the dimer banded at 31.5% sucrose, giving estimated sedimentation coefficients of about 8.3 and 10.2 Svedberg units, respectively, using the method of McEwen (12McEwen C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 114-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The ratio of the sedimentation coefficients for the dimer and monomer were estimated to just above 1.2. Analysis of different apoB species with known masses by the same method showed a sedimentation coefficient of 6.0 S for apoB-100 (512 kDa) and a ratio of S values of about 1.2 between apoB-100 and apoB-48/53. That this ratio is similar to the one for the two MUC2 species suggests that the MUC2 monomer forms a dimer and not a trimer or larger oligomeric species at the initial biosynthetic step. An antiserum (α-MUC2N3), raised against a peptide from the non-O-glycosylation N terminus parts of MUC2, has now been used to study the MUC2 biosynthesis also after initiation ofO-glycosylation. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled LS 174T cells using this antiserum followed by analysis with agarose (2% Ultrapure, Life Technologies, Inc.) gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions revealed two MUC2 bands with a lower mobility than the non-O-glycosylated monomer (Fig. 2, M) and dimer (D). Another antiserum reacting withO-glycosylated MUC2 (α-MUC2C2), described in an accompanying article (13Axelsson M.A.B. Asker N. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18864-18870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), gave similar results to the α-MUC2N3 antiserum. Preincubation of the α-MUC2N3 antiserum with the peptide used for immunization inhibited the precipitation of these two MUC2 species (results not shown). Bands migrating to the same positions were also found when the N-acetylgalactosamine binding lectin from H. pomatia was used for precipitation. That these bands were not precipitated with the O-glycosylation-sensitive antiserum, α- MUC2TR, but rather with the H. pomatialectin suggested that the two MUC2 bands wereO-glycosylated. The upper and weaker of the two α-MUC2N3-precipitated bands disappeared upon reduction of the disulfide bonds, whereas the lower band remained at the same position. A probable explanation for the disappearance of the larger band upon reduction was that the upper band was a disulfide-stabilized dimer of the lower band. To further illustrate this, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed analyzing the sample under nonreducing conditions in the first dimension and under reducing conditions in the second (Fig. 2 B). The upper band migrated to the same position as the lower band after reduction, supporting the interpretation that the upper band was a dimer of the lower. The bands were diagonally oriented on the two-dimensional gel, reflecting a nonreducible size polydispersity, probably due toO-glycosylation heterogeneity. To determine the intracellular localization of the non-O-glycosylated and O-glycosylated MUC2 species, subcellular fractionation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed on LS 174T cells. The gradient was recovered from the bottom in 14 fractions, which were analyzed for calnexin (marker for the rough endoplasmic reticulum), NADPH cytochromec reductase activity (marker for the smooth endoplasmic reticulum), and galactosyltransferase activity (marker for the Golgi complex) (Fig. 3). The sucrose gradient was adjusted to obtain endoplasmic reticulum fractions that were depleted of galactosyltransferase activity. Fractions containing galactosyltransferase activity also contained NADPH cytochromec reductase activity, suggesting an incomplete separation of the Golgi complex from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Subcellular fractionation was performed on cells metabolically labeled for 2 h, followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, as shown in Fig. 3. The unloaded 14 fractions were serially immunoprecipitated with the α-MUC2TR antiserum (Fig. 4 A), followed by the α-MUC2N3 antiserum (Fig. 4 B) and analysis using SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis (mixture of 1.3% Ultrapure (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1.3% Sea Plaque low gelling temperature) under nonreducing conditions. The non-O-glycosylated mono- and dimers were mainly found in the heaviest sucrose fractions, containing the endoplasmic reticulum marker calnexin, but also distributed in fractions with lower sucrose density. The reason for this is probably incomplete separation of the microsome vesicles, but it could also be due to rupture of some vesicles before centrifugation. Precipitation of the O-glycosylated MUC2 species with the α-MUC2N3 antiserum showed that they comigrated with the galactosyltransferase activity, suggesting that O-glycosylated MUC2 species are confined to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4 B). Bands identified as both O-glycosylated mono- (Fig. 4 B,O-M) and dimers (O-D), discussed above for Fig. 2, were observed. Interestingly, the O-glycosylated monomer was found in the Golgi fractions, suggesting that not only the MUC2 dimer but also its monomer was transferred into the Golgi apparatus. In fact, most of the O-glycosylated MUC2 found in the Golgi-enriched fractions migrated as the monomer. To study the intracellular localization of the MUC2 apomucin dimerization in more detail, LS 174T cells were pulse-labeled for 2 min and chased for 0, 10, and 20 min (Fig. 5, A, B, and C, respectively), followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, under the conditions described in Fig. 3. The tubes were unloaded into 14 fractions, pooled in pairs, followed by immunoprecipitations using the O-glycosylation-sensitive α-MUC2TR antiserum and analysis under nonreducing conditions by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis. After only 2 min of labeling, small amounts of the dimer were observed in the heaviest parts of the gradient, containing the markers for the endoplasmic reticulum. With time, the amount of dimer increased, and mono- and dimers were observed also in fractions with lower sucrose densities. The importance of N-glycans in dimerization and further processing of the MUC2 mucin in LS 174T cells was studied. Cells were treated with increasing amounts of tunicamycin, and an optimal concentration completely inhibiting N-glycosylation (20 μg of tunicamycin/ml of culture medium) was chosen for the subsequent experiments (results not shown). Metabolically labeled LS 174T cells were treated with (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2 and 4) and without (lanes 1 and3) tunicamycin, followed by immunoprecipitation using the α-MUC2TR antiserum. Two major and two minor bands were observed when analyzing samples from tunicamycin-treated cells under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). When the sample from tunicamycin-treated cells was analyzed under reducing conditions, only one band was shown (lane 4), migrating as the lowest band observed under nonreducing conditions (lane 2). The reduced band migrated as the monomer treated with PNGase F, an enzyme eliminating most of the N-glycans form the protein core (lane 5). This also made it likely that the inhibition ofN-glycosylation by tunicamycin was complete. The lowest band upon tunicamycin treatment (lane 2) was thus the non-N-glycosylated MUC2 monomer (Fig. 6 A,non-N-M), and the second smallest showed a corresponding relative migration to the N-glycosylated dimer, suggesting that it was the non-N-glycosylated dimer (non-N-D). To determine the oligomeric state of the two minor bands and to verify the interpretation of the two major ones found in Fig. 6 A,lane 2, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed. Metabolically labeled LS 174T cells were immunoprecipitated with the α-MUC2TR antiserum and analyzed under nonreducing conditions in the first dimension and under reducing conditions in the second dimension (Fig. 6 B). All four nonreduced bands migrated to the same position on the gel after reduction, determining the nature of the non-N-glycosylated mono- and dimer and suggesting the formation not only of dimers but also of aggregates corresponding to putative trimers (non-N-A1) and tetramers (non-N-A2) in tunicamycin-treated cells. To follow the rate of dimerization, further oligomerization, and O-glycosylation of the MUC2 apomucin in normal and tunicamycin-treated cells, LS 174T cells were metabolically labeled for 30 min followed by a chase for 0–5 h. Serial immunoprecipitations were performed on the cell lysates starting with the α-MUC2TR antiserum (Fig. 7 A), followed by precipitation with the α-MUC2N3 antiserum (Fig. 7 B) and analysis under nonreducing conditions by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis. In the nontreated cells, the formation of N-glycosylated mono- and dimers during the first hour was followed by a decrease in the amount during the next hours. As the non-O-glycosylated mono- and dimers of MUC2 started to disappear after about 3 h, the α-MUC2N3 antiserum started to precipitate O-glycosylated MUC2 mono- and dimers. In tunicamycin-treated cells, formation of non-N-glycosylated mono- and dimers was also observed, but the rate was considerably slower than in the nontreated cells. With increased chase times, also, further oligomerization of the non-N-glycosylated MUC2 was observed. NoO-glycosylated bands were observed on the autoradiograms when immunoprecipitation was performed using the α-MUC2N3 antiserum. These results suggest that no non-N-glycosylated MUC2 apomucins were transported into the Golgi apparatus. Chase times up to 10 h were tested and did not show any O-glycosylated species precipitated with the α-MUC2N3 antiserum (results not shown). To determine the intracellular localization of the non-N-glycosylated MUC2 oligomeric forms, subcellular fractionation was performed (Fig. 8). Tunicamycin-treated cells were labeled for 30 min and chased for 2 h, followed by subcellular fractionation according to Fig. 3. After centrifugation, the tube was unloaded into 14 fractions, pooled in pairs, followed by immunoprecipitation using the α-MUC2TR antiserum and analysis under nonreducing conditions by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis. Already, the heaviest endoplasmic reticulum fraction revealed not only the non-N-glycosylated mono- and dimers, but also the aggregates corresponding to putative trimers (non-N-A1) and tetramers (non-N-A2). The tunicamycin-dependent oligomerization thus occurs early in the endoplasmic reticulum. The intensity of the four non-N-glycosylated bands decreased and was very weak over the fractions corresponding to the Golgi fractions, suggesting that these were not transported to the Golgi apparatus. This was also shown by the inability to precipitate any O-glycosylated homologues from these fractions by using the α-MUC2N3 antiserum (not shown). In earlier studies on the biosynthesis of the human MUC2 apomucin in the colon carcinoma cell line LS 174T (6Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we showed that the apomucin forms a non-O-glycosylated oligomer, as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. This oligomeric form was interpreted as a dimer based on the size estimated by SDS-PAGE. Sedimentation of the non-O-glycosylated mono- and dimer by rate zonal ultracentrifugation has now been performed on SDS-treated samples. The estimated sedimentation coefficients of the mono- and dimer were 8.3 and 10.2 S, respectively. These sedimentation coefficients cannot be compared with sedimentation coefficients of globular proteins and can thus only be used to compare the mass between the two species. Because the sedimentation coefficient of a particle is proportional to the mass, assuming a similar diffusion constant of the di- and monomer, the relationship between their sizes is estimated to be just above 1.2. The ratio of the S values for SDS-treated apoB-100 and apoB-48/52, having a relation in mass of 1:2, was also determined and found to be about 1.2, suggesting a similar ratio for a doubled mass for other proteins also. These results, together with the migration in SDS-PAGE and SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis, strongly suggest that the monomer of the human MUC2 mucin forms a dimer in the initial step of the biosynthesis. To study the initial biosynthesis of the human MUC2 mucin in more detail, subcellular fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation on LS 174T cells has now been performed. Fractions containing the rough endoplasmic reticulum were well separated from the Golgi apparatus as judged from the presence of calnexin and the absence of galactosyltransferase activity (Fig. 3). On the other hand, less dense parts of the endoplasmic reticulum, containing NADPH cytochromec reductase activity, were not completely separated from the fractions containing galactosyltransferase activity. Within the first minutes of biosynthesis, both the MUC2 mono- and dimers were observed in the endoplasmic reticulum. This showed that the dimerization occurs directly after translation of the apoprotein. Both the monomer and dimer of the MUC2 apomucin are found in fractions containing lighter parts of endoplasmic reticulum, proposing that the process of folding and dimerization might continue when MUC2 is moved within the reticulum. Studies on the biosynthesis of the non-O-glycosylated mono- and dimers of the MUC2 apomucin showed that the amounts of these had their maximum 30 min to 1 h after labeling and that both declined simultaneously as the chase time increased. This is in accord with the biosynthesis of the vWF, in which dimers are the only oligomers formed before transport to the Golgi apparatus (14Wagner D.D. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To follow the MUC2 apomucin into the Golgi apparatus, anO-glycosylation-insensitive antiserum (α-MUC2N3) against the N-terminal parts of the MUC2 mucin protein core was used. As the amount of mono- and dimers decreased, larger molecules were precipitated with the α-MUC2N3 antiserum. These two species were interpreted as O-glycosylated and found in the subcellular fractions containing markers for the Golgi apparatus. The α-MUC2TR antiserum was not able to precipitate these species, probably due to hiding of the epitopes by the added O-glycans. H. pomatia, however, precipitated species migrating to the same position on the gel. The two O-glycosylated MUC2 species were interpreted as mono- and dimers because they appeared when the non-O-glycosylated mono- and dimer started to disappear in the endoplasmic reticulum. It was also verified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis that both O-glycosylated species migrate to the same positions under reducing conditions (Fig. 2 B). The monomeric band seems upon reduction to divide into two adjacent bands (Fig. 2 A, lane 1), a phenomenon that has not yet been explained but that is probably due to glycosylation heterogeneity. The tiny band under the O-glycosylated monomer (lane 1) is the non-O-glycosylated monomer, with an identical position on the gel as to the position of this species precipitated by α-MUC2TR. The O-glycosylated monomers and dimers appeared at the same time, indicating that monomers and dimers from the endoplasmic reticulum are O-glycosylated in parallel. The presence of anO-glycosylated monomer in the Golgi apparatus is surprising. The only known function of the MUC2 mucin, gel formation, is thought to require long polymers, the precursors of which, according to the von Willebrand factor analogy, should be dimers. It is, of course, possible that dimers are formed from monomers both in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the Golgi apparatus, but the retaining of labeled glycosylated monomers in the cells at a substantial amount 3 days after labeling (13Axelsson M.A.B. Asker N. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18864-18870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) contradicts the idea that such a process is of great importance. This fact also suggested the possibility that theO-glycosylated monomers in the Golgi apparatus were not destined for degradation. It might be, instead, that single monomers comprise a specific physiological function different from forming mucus. Another possibility could be that single monomers in the Golgi apparatus/secretory vesicles should terminate polymer elongation and that the ratio monomer/dimer released from the endoplasmic reticulum could determine the final polymer length. A comparison of the amount of non-O-glycosylated mono- and dimer being transferred from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is difficult to make because the α-MUC2N3 antiserum is less efficient in precipitating MUC2 compared with the α-MUC2TR antiserum. This means that these immunoprecipitations could not be used to determine the total amount of MUC2 apomucin transported into the Golgi system. However, further studies of the MUC2 apomucin assembly show the formation of larger and more complex forms of theO-glycosylated MUC2 apomucins in the Golgi apparatus (13Axelsson M.A.B. Asker N. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18864-18870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The relatively low intensity of the bands representing theO-glycosylated forms of the MUC2 apomucin precipitated by the α-MUC2N3 antiserum could then not only depend on this antiserum but also on the transformation of O-glycosylated species into larger, insoluble MUC2 species not found using the present approach. By treating LS 174T cells with tunicamycin, the importance of addition of N-glycans to the growing MUC2 apomucin was analyzed. By the mobility shift observed on the gel between the apomucins precipitated from tunicamycin-treated and nontreated cells (Fig. 6 A), it was evident that the N-glycosylation of the MUC2 apomucin was inhibited. Studies on the biosynthesis of the human MUC2 apomucin after treatment with tunicamycin have been reported earlier (15McCool D.J. Forstner J.F. Forstner G.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Ohara S. Byrd J.C. Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but none of them showed any difference in mobility between the N-glycosylated and the non-N-glycosylated MUC2 apomucins. Despite the lack ofN-glycans, the human MUC2 apomucin formed dimers in the endoplasmic reticulum. Pulse-chase experiments showed that this dimerization was delayed compared with dimerization in the nontreated cells. The lower rate of dimerization in tunicamycin-treated cells could be due to misfolding of the protein, thus allowing for the formation of incorrect disulfide bonds. As observed in Fig. 6 A, large amounts of non-N-glycosylated MUC2 mono- and dimers still appear after a 5-h chase as compared with a rapid decrease of mono- and dimer after a 2-h chase in nontreated cells. The human non-N-glycosylated MUC2 apomucins were not transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum because noO-glycosylated MUC2 mono- and dimers were found in tunicamycin-treated cells, proposing the idea that the mono- and dimers formed were not correctly folded and trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum control machinery. In a pulse-chase experiment with a 10-h chase, the amount of mono- and dimers was lower than it was after a 5-h chase, but still no MUC2 species were precipitated with the α-MUC2N3 antiserum (results not shown). These observations suggest that non-N-glycosylated MUC2 apomucins slowly degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum and that they were never transported to the Golgi apparatus. The similarities in the cysteine position in the C-terminal of the vWF with several mucins, including the human MUC2 and the porcine submaxillary mucin, suggests similarities in the dimer formation of these proteins. Expression of the C-terminal domain of the porcine submaxillary mucin in COS cells (17Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) proposed that the dimerization of the C-terminal domain occurred irrespective ofN-glycosylation inhibition. The inhibition ofN-glycan formation did not inhibit further transport of the porcine submaxillary mucin dimers into the Golgi apparatus. Inhibition of N-glycosylation of the human vWF in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells inhibited dimerization and further transport into the Golgi complex (18Wagner D.D. Mayadas T. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The different biosynthetic patterns for the non-N-glycosylated human MUC2 apomucin, the vWF, and the porcine submaxillary mucin could be the result of studies performed in different cell lines. However, different mechanisms could be involved in controlling the folding and the transport of the different proteins through the cell, despite similarities in the localization of the disulfide bonds. Alignment of the C-terminal amino acid sequences of the MUC2 apomucin, the porcine submaxillary mucin, and the vWF according to the positions of the cysteine domains found in the vWF showed no similarity in the possible N-glycosylation sites of the far C-terminal end postulated to be involved in dimerization. Some similarity in the possible N-glycosylation sites was observed upstream of the C-terminal domain but never involving all three sequences. This suggests that inhibition of N-glycans could have different effects during the biosynthesis of the three proteins. Not only dimers, but also two fainter bands larger in size than the dimers, were observed in the endoplasmic reticulum when tunicamycin-treated cells were precipitated using the α-MUC2TR antiserum. These two faint bands were interpreted as disulfide bond-stabilized putative tri- and tetramers of the non-N-glycosylated MUC2 apomucin as seen by studies done with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6 B). In the first dimension, the mono- and dimers and the two oligomeric bands were separated form each other under nonreducing conditions. In the second dimension, under reducing conditions, all bands migrated to the same position. Because the lysis buffer contained NEM, inhibiting in vitro disulfide bond formation, the disulfide-stabilized oligomers must be formed in the cells. The bands migrating as putative tri- and tetramers could also be interpreted as the non-N-glycosylated mono- and dimers destined for degradation and covered with chaperones causing the apparent larger size. This is unlikely, however, because the same large amount of chaperones must then be bound. Also, the interaction between chaperones and proteins is not known to be resistant to boiling in 5% SDS. Two faint bands larger in size than the dimer could also be shown without tunicamycin treatment, but in much smaller amounts than in treated cells because these could be observed only after weeks of exposing the gel to x-ray film. Comparing the biosynthesis of the human MUC2 mucin with studies on other mucins would indicated if there is a common biosynthetic pathway for all secreting mucins. The biosynthetic studies on rat gastric mucins by Dekker et al. (19Dekker J. Van Beurden-Lamers W.M.O. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10431-10437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dekker J. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18116-18122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed the formation of not only dimers but also trimers and possibly tetramers beforeO-glycosylation of the apomucin. Studies on human gastric mucin and human gallbladder mucin by Klomp et al. (21Klomp L.W.J. van Rens L. Strous G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Klomp L.W.J. de Lely A.J Strous G.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) showed that both apomucins form only one oligomer species in the endoplasmic reticulum, interpreted as a tri- or tetramer based on the size determined by SDS-PAGE. Our finding of glycosylated monomers is also in contrast to the biosynthesis of oligomeric mucins, as described for the rat gastric mucin (19Dekker J. Van Beurden-Lamers W.M.O. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10431-10437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dekker J. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18116-18122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligomerization was interpreted as a prerequisite for the transport of this rat gastric mucin into the Golgi apparatus. However, for the human MUC2 mucin, theN-glycans are interpreted as required for the correct folding of MUC2 monomer and dimer, and only these are allowed to pass the endoplasmic reticulum control machinery. The finding of Perez-Vilaret al. (17Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) of the transport of a recombinant truncated C terminus of the porcine submaxillary mucin through the whole secretory machinery of COS cells could propose another biosynthetic pathway or cell type specific control processes for this mucin compared with others. One may then speculate that there is not one common biosynthetic pathway for all gel-forming mucins, but instead biosynthetic differences between different mucins, as well as between mucin-producing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2172202413,"C2 domains have been identified in a wide range of intracellular proteins, including lipid modifying enzymes, protein kinases, GTPases, and proteins involved in membrane trafficking. Many C2 domains bind membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. The first C2 domain from synaptotagmin I (SytIC2A) and the C2 domain from cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2C2) are among the best characterized C2 domains in terms of their structures and calcium binding. Here we demonstrate that the protein-lipid interaction is dramatically different for these two domains. Photolabeling with 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine ([125I]TID) in the presence of phospholipid vesicles indicates that cPLA2C2 penetrates into the hydrophobic region of the membrane. Hydrophobic surfaces on cPLA2C2 are exposed even in the absence of calcium, but only in its presence does the domain penetrate into the nonpolar core of the membrane. The interaction of SytIC2A with phospholipid membranes is primarily electrostatic with binding being abolished in 500 mm NaCl. Because soluble phospholipid head group analogues do not compete with binding of either SytIC2A or cPLA2C2 to vesicles, it is likely that membrane binding by these domains involves multiple interactions.

C2 domains, named for homology to the second conserved domain in protein kinase C, have been identified in a variety of proteins involved in membrane interactions (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ponting C.P.

Despite great sequence diversity, the domains are structurally quite similar and consist of an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-sandwich. The most notable structural differences occur in three loops at the calcium-binding end of the domain. The domains bind multiple calcium ions in adjacent sites using the side chains of several aspartate or asparagine residues at the bases of these three loops. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cδ1 binds three calcium ions in this region, whereas SytIC2A and cPLA2C2 bind two (4Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.

In contrast to calcium binding, the nature of membrane binding by C2 domains is not fully understood. Studies of lipid specificity indicate that SytIC2A binds acidic phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylserine (PS) (11Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas cPLA2C2 shows a preference for binding zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) (12Nalefski E.A. McDonagh T. Somers W. Seehra J. Falke J.J. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1365-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have examined in parallel the nature of the membrane interactions for SytIC2A and cPLA2C2. Our results suggest that these two types of C2 domains have very different membrane binding characteristics: calcium-dependent phospholipid binding by cPLA2C2 is accompanied by penetration into the hydrophobic core of membranes, whereas electrostatic interactions with membranes predominate for SytIC2A.DISCUSSIONThe three-dimensional structure of SytIC2A suggested that clusters of basic residues around the calcium-binding site were responsible for SytIC2A binding acidic phospholipids (3Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), whereas clusters of hydrophobic residues present in cPLA2C2 might be important for neutral lipid specificity (8Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus we sought to find out whether these differences would be reflected in the hydrophobic properties of these domains. Our results for Triton X-114 partitioning show that cPLA2C2, unlike SytIC2A, acquires an overall nonpolar character in the presence of calcium. This acquisition of a nonpolar character for cPLA2C2 is not the result of a large conformational change that exposes a hydrophobic surface in a calcium-dependent manner because both bis-ANS binding and [125I]TID labeling in the absence of vesicles are unaffected by calcium. A previous observation that high salt concentration (e.g. 1.5 mNa2SO4) promotes binding of cPLA2C2 to vesicles even in the absence of calcium (12Nalefski E.A. McDonagh T. Somers W. Seehra J. Falke J.J. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1365-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) suggests the presence of constitutively exposed hydrophobic surfaces in cPLA2C2. A possible role of the calcium binding is to neutralize the patch of acidic calcium-binding residues that are seen in the crystal structure. This would thereby decrease the polarity of cPLA2C2, enabling a hydrophobic part of the domain to penetrate the membrane. The third calcium-binding loop that has three exposed hydrophobic residues (96YVM98) might be a plausible candidate for penetration into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer (8Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Because SytIC2A has a single exposed phenylalanine residue in the middle of this loop (233RFSK236), trace labeling of SytIC2A in the presence of calcium might be because of a much reduced degree of membrane penetration. Site-directed mutagenesis shall provide us with a direct answer as to which residues penetrate into the hydrophobic layer of membranes.It has been demonstrated that cPLA2 requires the C2 domain for calcium-dependent translocation to internal membranes where the enzyme catalyzes the release of free arachidonic acid (16Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 17Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The precise calcium-dependent function for the C2 domains of synaptotagmin is not known. SytIC2A has been shown to bind in vitro both proteins and membranes as a function of calcium (18Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar,19Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that calcium-triggered electrostatic changes in SytIC2A (15Shao X. Li C. Fernandez I. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) are responsible for binding syntaxin, a presynaptic protein with a function in neurotransmitter release. Our present results indicate that electrostatic interactions also play an important role in membrane binding by SytIC2A. Similarly, loss of membrane binding by PKCβII at increased ionic strength suggests that the C2 domain of PKC binds PS-containing membranes primarily electrostatically (20Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The calcium-dependent interaction of the C2 domain of PKCβII with phospholipids does not seem to be simply because of the change in the balance of negative and positive charges at the calcium-binding site because mutations that introduced positive charges at this site did not lead to calcium-independent membrane binding (21Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15615-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Calcium may play an additional role of directly bridging C2 domains and the phospholipids as it does for annexin V (22Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Our competition study with headgroup analogs suggests that the C2 domains binding requires a certain display of phospholipid headgroups on the membrane and occurs via multiple interactions. In addition, cPLA2C2 may also require the intact hydrophobic core of the membrane.In summary, using several complementary approaches, we have demonstrated that the mode of calcium-dependent membrane interaction may vary for different C2 domains. Our data suggest a model for cPLA2C2 binding to membranes with constitutively exposed hydrophobic surfaces that partially penetrate into the nonpolar regions of lipid membranes whereas SytIC2A has a predominantly electrostatic interaction with membrane surfaces. The C2 domains described here may serve as valuable prototypes for understanding calcium-dependent membrane binding by these modules in a broad range of proteins. C2 domains, named for homology to the second conserved domain in protein kinase C, have been identified in a variety of proteins involved in membrane interactions (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ponting C.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The precise calcium-dependent function for the C2 domains of synaptotagmin is not known. SytIC2A has been shown to bind in vitro both proteins and membranes as a function of calcium (18Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar,19Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that calcium-triggered electrostatic changes in SytIC2A (15Shao X. Li C. Fernandez I. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) are responsible for binding syntaxin, a presynaptic protein with a function in neurotransmitter release. Our present results indicate that electrostatic interactions also play an important role in membrane binding by SytIC2A. Similarly, loss of membrane binding by PKCβII at increased ionic strength suggests that the C2 domain of PKC binds PS-containing membranes primarily electrostatically (20Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The calcium-dependent interaction of the C2 domain of PKCβII with phospholipids does not seem to be simply because of the change in the balance of negative and positive charges at the calcium-binding site because mutations that introduced positive charges at this site did not lead to calcium-independent membrane binding (21Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15615-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Calcium may play an additional role of directly bridging C2 domains and the phospholipids as it does for annexin V (22Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Our competition study with headgroup analogs suggests that the C2 domains binding requires a certain display of phospholipid headgroups on the membrane and occurs via multiple interactions. In addition, cPLA2C2 may also require the intact hydrophobic core of the membrane. In summary, using several complementary approaches, we have demonstrated that the mode of calcium-dependent membrane interaction may vary for different C2 domains. Our data suggest a model for cPLA2C2 binding to membranes with constitutively exposed hydrophobic surfaces that partially penetrate into the nonpolar regions of lipid membranes whereas SytIC2A has a predominantly electrostatic interaction with membrane surfaces. The C2 domains described here may serve as valuable prototypes for understanding calcium-dependent membrane binding by these modules in a broad range of proteins. We thank M. Stowell for advice on the fluorescence experiment and H. T. McMahon for a critical review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2005427150,"We have examined the regulation of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) gene expression in response to glucose and insulin. In Hep G2 cells, endogenous apoA-I mRNA was suppressed by one-half or induced 2-fold following 48 h of exposure to high concentrations of glucose (22.4 mm) or insulin (100 microunits/ml), respectively, compared with control. Transcriptional activity of the rat apoA-I promoter (−474 to −7) in Hep G2 cells paralleled endogenous mRNA expression, and this activity was dependent on the dose of glucose or insulin. Deletional analysis showed that a 50-base pair fragment spanning −425 to −376 of the promoter mediated the effects of both insulin and glucose. Within this DNA fragment there is a motif (−411 to −404) that is homologous to a previously identified insulin response core element (IRCE). Mutation of this motif abolished not only the induction of the promoter by insulin but also abrogated its suppression by glucose. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of nuclear extracts from Hep G2 cells revealed IRCE binding activity that formed a duplex with radiolabeled probe. The IRCE binding activity correlated with insulin induction of apoA-I expression. In summary, our data show that glucose decreases and insulin increases apoA-I promoter activity. This effect appears to be mediated by a single cis-acting element. We have examined the regulation of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) gene expression in response to glucose and insulin.

The serum protein, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), 1The abbreviations used are: apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I; IRCE, insulin response core element; DM, diabetes mellitus; bp base pair; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. has intrinsic antiatherogenic properties and is the major apoprotein component of the high density lipoprotein particles (1Forte T.M. McCall M.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Barter P.J. Ryek A. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 121: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Increased abundance of apoA-I correlates inversely with the incidence of coronary arterial disease (3Barr D.P. Russ E.M. Eder H.A. Am. J. Med. 1951; 11: 480-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 4Miller G.J. Miller N.E. Lancet. 1975; 1: 16-19Abstract PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). This beneficial feature of the protein arises from its pivotal role in a normal physiologic process called reverse cholesterol transport (5Miller N.E. Laville A. Crook D. Nature. 1985; 314: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). ApoA-I mediates the transfer of cholesterol from extra-hepatic tissues to high density lipoprotein particles which in turn shuttle cholesterol to the liver for excretion from the body in the form of bile salts or free cholesterol (6Guyton A.C. Hall J.E. Textbook of Medical Physiology. 9th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1996Google Scholar). Enhanced reverse cholesterol transport lowers total body cholesterol. Previous epidemiologic studies have shown a clear inverse correlation between levels of apoA-I and the incidence of coronary artery disease in both normal and diabetic individuals (7Sniderman A. Michel C. Racine N. J. Clin. Epidemiol. 1992; 45: 1357-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Stamler J. Vaccaro O. Neaton J.D. Wentworth D. Diabetes Care. 1993; 16: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). This protective feature of apoA-I is of primary importance in the clinical setting of diabetes mellitus (DM) because these patients have a 2–3-fold higher risk of developing premature arterial atherosclerosis compared with the general population (8Stamler J. Vaccaro O. Neaton J.D. Wentworth D. Diabetes Care. 1993; 16: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). The increased risk of atherosclerosis often leads to premature death when the disease results in occlusion of the coronary or cerebral vessels. One potential explanation for the higher risk of atherosclerosis in diabetics may be attributed to lower levels of apoA-I protein in these patients (9Laakso M. Voutilainen E. Pvorala K. Sarlund H. Arteiosclerosis. 1985; 5: 653-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since hyperglycemia and deficient insulin action are pathognemonic features of DM, we wondered how these abnormalities affected expression of apoA-I. Regardless of whether the patient has insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent DM arising from hypo- or hyperinsulinemia, respectively, both diseases are associated with the enhanced risk of arteriosclerosis (10Despres J.P.

To further understand the mechanisms by which glucose and insulin regulate levels of apoA-I, we have used both a cell culture and animal model to examine apoA-I expression in response to changes of these metabolic factors. The results of our studies show that glucose and insulin have opposite effects on activity of the apoA-I gene in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the repressive and stimulatory actions of glucose and insulin on apoA-I gene transcription appears to be mediated through a 50-bp fragment present in the apoA-I promoter. Construction of the pA1.474.CAT plasmid used in the transient transfection studies was described previously (12Romney J.S. Chan J. Carr F.E. Mooradian A.D. Wong N.C.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 943-950PubMed Google Scholar). Two constructs, pA1.425.CAT and pA1.375.CAT containing promoter segments −425 and −375 to −7, respectively, were synthesized using the parent pAI.474.CAT as a template in separate polymerase chain reactions. These reactions were primed with a unique 5′ oligonucleotide spanning −425 to −413 or −375 to −363, respectively, plus a common 3′ oligomer from −19 to −7. The mutant template was created in a similar fashion with the 5′ primer containing transverse mutations of all eight nucleotides in the putative insulin responsive core element (IRCE). Human apoA-I cDNA used in the Northern blots was a generous gift from J. L. Breslow, Columbia University, New York (13Breslow J.L. Ross D. McPherson J. Williams H. Kurnit D. Nussbaum A.L. Karathanasis S.K. Zannis V.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 7922: 6861-6865Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The Hep G2, human hepatoma cells chosen for the studies express both a glucose transporter and the insulin receptor (14Hatada E.N. McClain D.A. Potter E. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6741-6747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in RPMI-ISE supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum, as described previously (15Nakabayashi H. Hashimoto T. Miyao Y. Tjong K.K. Chan J. Tamaoki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5885-5893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the plasmid of interest using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (16Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Two μg of Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase was added to all tranfections to monitor the efficiency of DNA uptake by Hep G2 cells. Transfected cells were maintained in control media containing 5.5 mm for 24 h before treatment with concentrations of glucose up to 40 mm, 2-deoxyglucose (Sigma) up to 22.4 mm, or insulin (Humulin R, Eli Lily) ranging from 0 to 1000 microunits/ml for 24 or 48 h. The only exception being the glucose dose response studies in which one set of cells was treated without glucose. Harvested cells were lysed by several cycles of freeze-thawing in a dry ice/alcohol slurry, and cellular debris was collected at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. An aliquot of the supernatant was taken for the measurement of β-galactosidase activity (17Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic fraction was heated at 60 °C for 10 min to destroy endogenous deacetylases, and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was measured as described previously (18Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 150–175 grams were purchased from Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN. In the fructose studies, the rats were fed a standard chow (caloric content was 62% complex carbohydrates, 23% protein, and 14.9% fat) or a high fructose diet (caloric content was 65.7% fructose, 21.9% protein, and 12.3% fat purchased from Teklad Laboratories, Madison, WI) as described previously (19Reaven G.M. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Serum for apoA-I protein determinations by Western analysis was collected by cardiac puncture prior to the induction of DM or inferior vena cava puncture at the time they were killed. Blood glucose and serum insulin levels were measured as described previously (21Barrera-Hernandez G. Wanke I.E. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9969-9975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The livers were excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated from Hep G2 cells or rat liver using a single step acid guanidinium phenol:chloroform extraction procedure (22Chirgwin J.M. Przybylz A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total RNA (10 μg) were separated electrophoretically on a denaturing 1% agarose gel containing 0.4 m formaldehyde (23Wong N.C.W. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10387-10393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The separated RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Zeta Bind, Cuno AMF) and probed with a 32P-labeled human apoA-I cDNA for 18–24 h at 62 °C as described previously (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 18 and 28 S ribosomal RNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining to ensure that equal amounts of total RNA were applied to each lane. Serum from experimental animals was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Waters Corp.). The blot was probed with a polyclonal antibody the characteristics of which were described previously (25Taylor A.H. Raymond J. Dionne J.M. Romney J.S. Chan J. Lawless D.E. Wanke I.E. Wong N.C.W. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2232-2243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from Hep G2 cells were prepared using a technique described previously (26Dyer R.B. Heroz N.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic DNA duplexes spanning −419 to −388 (AATGCAACGAAACTTTGAGGCGGGGATGTGAG, synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc.) from the apoA-I gene and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) IRCE (AACTTTCCCGCCTCTCAGCCTTTGAAAG) used in these studies were radiolabeled at the 5′-ends by incubating each strand separately with [γ32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase prior to annealing. Each binding reaction of 20 μl contained 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, 5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 fmol of radiolabeled probe, and 20 μg of nuclear extract. In competition analysis, 50- or 300-fold molar excess of unlabeled homologous or non-homologous competitor DNA was added to the reaction prior to the addition of nuclear extracts. A sequence homologous to the IRCE from the glucagon (TAGTTTTTCACGCCTGACTGAGATTGAAGGGT) gene served as a competitor. All reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then separated on a 6% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel (27Wong N.C.W. Perez-Castillo A. Sanders M.M. Schwartz H.L. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 26: 4466-4470Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed at 10 volts/cm2 for 3 h at 4 °C. The gel was then dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C in the presence of intensifying screens. To analyze the effects of glucose and insulin on apoA-I expression, we measured the levels of endogenous apoA-I mRNA in the human hepatoma cell line, Hep G2. Exposure of these cells to 22.4 mm glucose for 24 or 48 h decreased the abundance of endogenous apoA-I mRNA to one-half as compared with that in cells maintained in control media (Fig. 1). Cells exposed to 100 microunits/ml of insulin for 48 h showed a 2-fold increase in apoA-I mRNA (Fig. 1). Treatment of the cells for 48 h with both factors at the concentrations quoted elicited an induction (1.3-fold) that was intermediate between that of glucose and insulin. Ethidium bromide staining of the 18 and 28 S rRNA bands showed no significant differences in the quantity of total RNA loaded into each of the lanes (data not shown). These results show clearly that glucose and insulin have opposite effects on the expression of apoA-I mRNA in Hep G2 cells. The preceding observations prompted us to measure transcriptional activity of the apoA-I promoter in the Hep G2 cells. For these studies, we have used the rat apoA-I promoter because it has been studied extensively and its similarity to the human counterpart (28Haddad I.A. Ordovas J.M. Fitzpatrick T. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13268-13277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Higuchi K. Law S.W. Hoeg J.M. Schumacher U.K. Meglin N. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18530-18536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The response of pAI.474.CAT to both 22.4 mm of glucose and/or 100 microunits/ml of insulin in the Hep G2 cells is shown in Fig. 2 A. Consistent with the observed changes in the level of endogenous apoA-I mRNA, 22.4 mm glucose inhibited promoter activity. Conversely, 100 microunits/ml insulin stimulated CAT activity. In the presence of both factors, there was a small but not significant increase in CAT activity. The inhibitory actions of glucose were not due to an osmotic effect because exposure of the cells to 2-deoxyglucose (22.4 mm) did not inhibit activity of the promoter (results not shown). These findings indicate that activity of the rat apoA-I promoter in Hep G2 cells following exposure to glucose and insulin matched endogenous expression of apoA-I mRNA. The optimal concentration of glucose or insulin leading to maximal suppression or induction, respectively, of apoA-I promoter activity was determined by assaying the activity of pAI.474.CAT in the presence of increasing doses of either factor (Fig. 2 B). Activity of the template was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by glucose with a maximal 50 ± 7% reduction in the presence of 22.4 mm glucose (Fig. 1). Insulin, on the other hand, increased CAT-activity in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal 2 ± 0.2-fold induction at 100 microunits/ml (Fig. 2). Results revealed that activity of pAI.474.CAT was maximally inhibited in the presence of 22.4 mm glucose, and the highest induction was observed following exposure to 100 microunits/ml of insulin. Additionally, response of the promoter to either factor was dose-dependent. In the remainder of the transfection studies, we used the optimal doses of glucose or insulin as defined above. To locate cis-acting site(s) in the apoA-I promoter that mediated the effects of glucose and/or insulin, deletional templates were constructed by removing segments of the promoter contained in pAI.474.CAT. Constructs arising from the removal of 47 and 97 base pairs from pAI.474.CAT yielded templates, pA1.425.CAT and pA1.375.CAT, respectively, as shown schematically in Fig. 3 A. The activity of pA1.425.CAT in Hep G2 cells following exposure to glucose and/or insulin was identical to that of the full-length promoter construct, pAI.474.CAT (compare Fig. 3, B withC). Glucose inhibited the activities of pAI.474.CAT and pAI.425.CAT by a similar degree, 50 ± 7 and 55 ± 5%, respectively. As expected, insulin stimulated the activity of pAI.474.CAT and pAI.425.CAT by the same amount, 2 ± 0.2- and 1.9 ± 0.1-fold, respectively. The combination of both glucose and insulin had an intermediate effect resulting in a small induction of pAI.474.CAT (1.4 ± 0.2-fold) and pAI.425.CAT (1.5 ± 0.1-fold). However, the pAI.375.CAT construct (Fig. 3 D) containing the −325 to −7 fragment of the promoter was no longer responsive to either glucose or insulin. Together these observations show that glucose and insulin, respectively, represses and stimulates transcription of the apoA-I gene, and these effects require the −425 to −376 segment of the promoter. To further define cis-acting motif(s) in the rat apoA-I promoter that mediated the effects of glucose and insulin, we searched the promoter for known glucose or insulin response elements within the −425 to −376 fragment. Our search revealed an octanucleotide motif (CCCGCCTC, −411 to −404, Fig. 4) that is identical to the insulin core response element (IRCE) of the GAPDH gene (30Nasrin N. Ercolani L. Denaro M. Kong X.F. Kang I. Alexander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and shares an 88% homology with a similar IRCE found in domain A of the glucagon gene (31Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 7224-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). No similarities to previously described carbohydrate response elements found in the l-pyruvate kinase and S14 genes were identified in the −425 to −376 fragment (32Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23235-23258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To show that the −411 to −404 motif mediated the effects of insulin, we created a construct, pmAI.425.CAT (Fig. 4 A) that contained a mutated putative IRCE. The wild-type pAI.425.CAT construct produced CAT activities similar to pAI.474.CAT in HepG2 cells following exposure to 22.4 mm glucose, 100 microunits/ml insulin or both factors (Fig. 4 B, open bars). In contrast, the activity of the pmAI.425.CAT construct was no longer induced by 100 microunits/ml insulin (Fig. 4 B, shaded bars). These data suggest that the CCCGCCTC motif in the wild-type promoter mediates the stimulatory effect of insulin. Unexpectedly, activity of the mutant template was not inhibited by glucose. These observations suggest the IRCE in apoA-I DNA mediates the stimulatory actions of insulin and the same site may also mediate the inhibitory effects of glucose. Next we examined whether the actions of insulin or glucose affected the binding activity of nuclear proteins that interacted with the rat apoA-I IRCE. Nuclear proteins extracted from HepG2 cells treated with glucose or insulin were tested using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 5). IRCE binding activity in control Hep G2 cells bound to the radiolabeled probe to form complexes that migrated as a doublet (Fig. 5 A). The intensity of the lower band in the doublet was not affected by treatment with glucose or insulin (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, intensity of the upper complex was increased in cells treated either with insulin alone or in combination with glucose (Fig. 5 A). To ensure that the observed pattern of binding activity from Hep G2 cells was a specific interaction between putative nucleoproteins and the radiolabeled probe, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed in the presence of a 50- or 300-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNA. Addition of the glucagon IRCE, which differed from the apoA-I IRCE by one nucleotide, did not decrease binding activity (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, a 50-fold molar excess of the IRCE from the apoA-I or GAPDH genes competed for binding to the radiolabeled apoA-I probe (Fig. 5 C, lanes 2 and 4). Additional confirmation of these observations comes from studies of radiolabeled GADPH IRCE tested in binding reactions. Results showed the formation of protein·DNA complexes identical to that of the apoA-I probe (Fig. 5 C, lane 5). Furthermore, the binding activity to the GAPDH probe is abolished in the presence of 50-fold molar excess of GAPDH or apoA-I IRCE (Fig. 5 C, lanes 6 and 8). Together these observations showed that in Hep G2 cells, the DNA binding activity that recognizes rat apoA-I IRCE is specific, and this activity is enhanced by the actions of insulin but not glucose. Furthermore, the protein(s) responsible for the binding activity recognizes the IRCEs from both apoA-I and GAPDH genes. Although in vitro experiments in cultured cells above have helped to elucidate the actions of glucose and insulin, whether the same effects of these factors extend to anin vivo model remains unanswered. The lack of animal models with features of either hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia alone makes it difficult to study these parameters in isolation. However, a model characterized by both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia may be obtained by feeding fructose to rats (19Reaven G.M. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To ensure that fructose-fed rats did indeed have elevated levels of both insulin and glucose, the levels of these parameters were measured in the treated animals. In fructose-fed rats, blood glucose increased 30% from 7.4 ± 0.7 mm to 9.6 ± 0.8 mm, and insulin was elevated by 42% from 2.4 ± 0.5 to 3.4 ± 0.5 microunits/ml (Fig. 6, right panel). The higher levels of glucose and insulin in the fructose-fed animals should increase apoA-I mRNA and protein, according to the in vitro model (Figs. 1 and 2). In agreement with this prediction, apoA-I mRNA was increased by 1.5 ± 0.3-fold, and apoA-I protein was increased by 2.2 ± 0.4-fold (Fig. 6, left panel). These findings show that glucose and insulin effects on apoA-I gene expression in rats is similar to that in cultured Hep G2 cells. In this report, we have examined the regulation of apoA-I gene expression in response to glucose and insulin. Interest in this topic stems from the clinical observation showing that hyperglycemia arising from hypo-/hyperinsulinemic states such as diabetes mellitus decreases the levels of apoA-I (33Barrett-Connor E. Philippi T. Khaw K.T. Am. J. Prev. Med. 1987; 3: 206-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced abundance of this protein is believed to underlie the higher rates of coronary arterial disease (7Sniderman A. Michel C. Racine N. J. Clin. Epidemiol. 1992; 45: 1357-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,8Stamler J. Vaccaro O. Neaton J.D. Wentworth D. Diabetes Care. 1993; 16: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). Although previous clinical observations clearly document that hyperglycemia is associated with lower levels of apoA-I in diabetics, a suitable in vitro model for studying the mechanism(s) responsible for this effect is not available. Therefore, Hep G2 cells were chosen for the studies because they express apoA-I, insulin receptor, and glucose transporter (14Hatada E.N. McClain D.A. Potter E. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6741-6747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When Hep G2 cells were exposed to high (22.4 mm) glucose concentrations, it reduced endogenous human apoA-I mRNA to one-half that in cells maintained in control media (5.5 mm). The importance of this finding is that the apoA-I lowering effect of hyperglycemia in vivo is also observed in the in vitro cell culture model. Additionally, the inhibitory effects of hyperglycemia on apoA-I is significant because eukaryotic genes repressed by glucose, excluding those found in yeast, are rare and include the Drosophila α-amylase, rat albumin, and the glucose transporter, GLUT-4 (20Wanke I.E.

Cells treated with insulin had 2-fold higher levels of the mRNA compared with controls. To our knowledge this is the first report showing that insulin increases apoA-I mRNA in liver-derived cells. Insulin has previously been shown to enhance the activity of several genes, such as (37Meisler M.H. Howard G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), GAPDH (38Alexander M.C. Lomanto M. Nasrin N. Ramaika C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5092-5096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), growth hormone (39Prager D. Melmed S. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 450-452Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since response of endogenous apoA-I in Hep G2 cells to glucose and insulin parallels the behavior of this gene in vivo, these features make the cultured cells a useful model for dissecting the mechanisms of glucose and insulin action. Both insulin and to a lesser extent, glucose are known to have direct effects on the transcription of many genes (42Knepel W. Jepeal L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8725-8735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Prager D. Gebremedhin S. Melmed S. J. Clin.

Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but the nuclear mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. This study shows that the repression and induction by insulin and glucose, respectively occur at the transcriptional level. The CAT-activity of transfected Hep G2 cells decreased to 50% or increased by 2-fold relative to that in control cells following exposure to 22.4 mm glucose or 100 microunits/ml of insulin, respectively. Furthermore, the magnitude of the opposing effects of the two metabolic parameters was dose-dependent (Figs. 2 and 3). Deletional analysis of the promoter allowed the identification of a 50-bp DNA fragment in the promoter-spanning nucleotides −425 to −376 that is required for the effects of both glucose and insulin. A motif identical to the IRCE found in the GAPDH promoter (30Nasrin N. Ercolani L. Denaro M. Kong X.F. Kang I. Alexander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and differs by 1 bp from that in the glucagon gene (31Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 7224-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), is present in the −425 to −376 fragment of the rat apoA-I promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis of this motif abolished the response of the promoter to hormone and thus, confirmed that it mediated the actions of insulin (Fig. 4). Both the rat apoA-I and the GAPDH genes are induced by insulin, whereas the glucagon gene is repressed by insulin (30Nasrin N. Ercolani L. Denaro M. Kong X.F. Kang I. Alexander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 31Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 7224-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 46Alexander M.C. Lomanto M.

Whether the difference between the apoA-I and glucagon IRCE can switch it from an inducible to an inhibitory element is uncertain. Despite insulin-mediating properties and sequence similarities among the IRCE from the rat apoA-I, GAPDH and glucagon genes, one marked difference is that the apoA-I promoter is inhibited by glucose. Additionally, although the apoA-I and GAPDH IRCEs are identical, insulin induction of GAPDH appears to be more complex requiring the cumulative actions of at least three cis-acting elements: g/TRE, IRE-A, and IRE-B (48Alexander-Bridges M. Dugast I. Ercolani L. Kong X.F. Giere L. Nasrin N. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1992; 32: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, the rat apoA-I IRCE alone appears to be the critical region that mediates the actions of the hormone. In the preceding section, examples of IRCE with marked similarities were mentioned. However, the IRCE is not the only motif that mediates the actions of insulin because insulin responsive cis-acting elements that differ from the IRCE have been identified in several genes. For example, insulin stimulation of the promoters that regulate prolactin, thymidine kinase, and somatostatin expression appear to be mediated by one or more CGGA motifs (49Jacob K.K. Ouyang L. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27773-27779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The transcription factor(s) that bind to the CGGA motif in these genes are related to the Ets family of nuclear proteins, such as Sap and Elk-1 (49Jacob K.K. Ouyang L. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27773-27779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The observed nucleotide differences between the apoA-I IRCE and insulin responsive element from other genes suggests that there exists more than one class of cis-acting elements which mediate the effects of insulin. Additional support for this idea arises from the lack of homology between the IRCE and the negative insulin response element from the PEPCK gene (50O'Brien R.M Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The existence of more than one type of insulin-regulated motif shows the complexities of gene control similar to the glucocorticoid response element and units found for example in the tyrosine aminotransferase and PEPCK genes (51Jantzen H.M. Strahle U. Gloss B. Stewart F. Schmid W. Boshart M. Miksicek R. Schutz G. Cell. 1987; 49: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 52Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The rat apoA-I IRCE also appears to mediate the inhibitory effects of glucose. This possibility is supported by the absence of a recognizable carbohydrate response element within the −425 to −376 fragment and the unexpected finding that mutation of the IRCE abolishes the inhibitory effects of glucose. A similar but not identical scenario applies to l-pyruvate kinase (l-PK) gene. Previous studies suggest that the stimulatory actions of both glucose and insulin co-localize to a single motif (−168 to −144) present in the l-PK promoter (53Bergot M. Diaz-Guerra M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 54Cuif M. Cognet M. Didier B. Tremp G. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). More recent data are in keeping with the idea of a response unit comprised of several cis-acting elements that cooperate to mediate the actions of glucose and insulin (55Guerra M.M.D. Bergot M. Martinez A. Cuif M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although l-PK promoter response requires the presence of insulin, it does not appear to be the primary signal (56Noguchi T. Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14393-14397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose seems to be more important, and its action is dependent on the binding of two transcription factors, LF-A1 and a c-myc related protein, to the carbohydrate response element located between −171 to −124 (57Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional hepatic enriched factor, HNF-4, is also required as an accessory factor that functions with the carbohydrate response element (58Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although it is tempting to speculate based on our data that a single motif mediates the actions of both glucose and insulin, this conclusion is likely premature. If so, then what are the potential explanations for our observation? Perhaps, the IRCE has a permissive effect on an adjacent carbohydrate responsive element. This means that the IRCE must be present to unmask the inhibitory actions of the adjacent element. Another possibility is that the IRCE may overlap with an element that mediates the effects of glucose. This possibility may explain why mutation of the IRCE also abolishes the activities of both glucose and insulin. Gel-retardation analysis of nuclear extract from Hep G2 cells treated with high glucose or insulin revealed IRCE binding activity that formed a doublet following electrophoretic separation. Nucleoproteins binding to the IRCE from hyperglycemic cells were no different from those in control cells, suggesting that glucose has no effect on this activity. However, insulin alone or in combination with hyperglycemia increased the abundance of the upper band in the doublet. These findings suggest that insulin alone increases IRCE binding activity. The observation that glucose does not modulate IRCE binding activity supports the idea that the IRCE may serve in a permissive role for the inhibitory effects of glucose or the possibility of overlapping elements. That insulin alone increases the activity of nucleoproteins which bind to the apoA-I IRCE is not unexpected. Previous studies of insulin-treated NIH-3T3 cells or an animal model of raised insulin levels produced by fasting followed by re-feeding showed increased binding activity to the GADPH IRCE (30Nasrin N. Ercolani L. Denaro M. Kong X.F. Kang I. Alexander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The rise in binding activity correlated with expression of GAPDH. The nuclear factor, IRE-ABP, believed to bind the IRCE from GAPDH has been cloned and is known to be related to mouse SRY (59Nasrin N. Buggs C. Kong X.F. Carnazza J. Goebl M. Alexander-Bridges M. Nature. 1991; 354: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 60Alexander-Bridges M. Ercolani L. Kong X.F. Nasrin N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The possibility that the apoA-I IRCE binding activity may be related to SRY is further supported by the finding that the GAPDH IRCE motif inhibits complex formation (Fig. 5 C) and that the pattern of binding to both radiolabeled apoA-I and GAPDH IRCE are identical (Fig. 5 C). Although in vitro experiments in cultured cells above allow us to study the actions of glucose and insulin, whether the same effects of these metabolic factors extend to an in vivomodel is difficult to test. The reason being that in animal models of DM, some insulin must be present or the animal will die from ketoacidosis. Conversely, hyperinsulinemic animals must have some glucose or they will die from hypoglycemia. Thus an animal model of either hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia alone is not available. However, an opportunity to extend the Hep G2 cell culture conditions to an in vivo model of both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, is possible. The fructose fed rat reflects a model of combined hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Increased levels of hepatic apoA-I protein and mRNA in these animals parallel closely the observed effects of glucose and insulin in vitro on Hep G2 cells. These results demonstrate clearly that the combined effects of glucose and insulin in both in vivo and in vitro are the same. In summary, the results in this study show that glucose inhibits and insulin stimulates the expression of the endogenous apoA-I mRNA in human Hep G2 cells. The opposite effects of these metabolic parameters on mRNA levels arises from their actions on transcriptional activity of the apoA-I promoter in these cells. Although the actions of glucose and insulin are mediated by the same DNA fragment, we only identified one motif that matches a previously described IRCE and none that resembles any of the known carbohydrate response elements. The nuclear proteins from Hep G2 cells that bind to the cis-acting site which mediate the effects of glucose and insulin increased following exposure to insulin but not glucose. The ability of insulin to enhance apoA-I gene expression reinforces the recommendation for tight glycemic control to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic disease in diabetic patients."

Amino acid residue Glu161 in the URA7-encoded andURA8-encoded CTP synthetases was identified as being involved in the regulation of these enzymes by CTP product inhibition. The specific activities of the URA7-encoded andURA8-encoded enzymes with a Glu161 → Lys (E161K) mutation were 2-fold greater when compared with the wild-type enzymes. The E161K mutant URA7-encoded andURA8-encoded CTP synthetases were less sensitive to CTP product inhibition with inhibitor constants for CTP of 8.4- and 5-fold greater, respectively, than those of their wild-type counterparts. Cells expressing the E161K mutant enzymes on a multicopy plasmid exhibited an increase in resistance to the pyrimidine poison and cancer therapeutic drug cyclopentenylcytosine and accumulated elevated (6–15-fold) levels of CTP when compared with cells expressing the wild-type enzymes. Cells expressing the E161K mutation in theURA7-encoded CTP synthetase exhibited an increase (1.5-fold) in the utilization of the Kennedy pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis when compared with control cells. Cells bearing the mutation also exhibited an increase in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (1.5-fold), phosphatidylethanolamine (1.3-fold), and phosphatidate (2-fold) and a decrease in the synthesis of phosphatidylserine (1.7-fold). These alterations were accompanied by an inositol excretion phenotype due to the misregulation of theINO1 gene. Moreover, cells bearing the E161K mutation exhibited an increase (1.6-fold) in the ratio of total neutral lipids to phospholipids, an increase in triacylglycerol (1.4-fold), free fatty acids (1.7-fold), and ergosterol ester (1.8-fold), and a decrease in diacylglycerol (1.3-fold) when compared with control cells.

CTP synthetase (EC 6.3.4.2, UTP:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)) is a cytosolic-associated glutamine amidotransferase that catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of the amide nitrogen from glutamine to the C-4 position of UTP to form CTP (1Liberman I.

In addition, elevated CTP synthetase activity is a common property of leukemic cells (19van den Berg A.A. van Lenthe H. Busch S. de Korte D. Roos D. van Kuilenburg A.B.P. van Gennip A.H. Eur. J.

These findings underscore the importance of studies to understand the regulation of CTP synthetase activity by CTP product inhibition. In this work we identified amino acid residue Glu161 in theURA7-encoded and URA8-encoded CTP synthetases to be involved in CTP product inhibition of the enzyme. Cells carrying a Glu161 → Lys (E161K) mutation in the CTP synthetases exhibited increased resistance to the pyrimidine poison and cancer therapeutic drug CPEC (23Kang G.J. Cooney D.A. Moyer J.D.

The E161K mutation in the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase caused alterations in the synthesis of phospholipids by the CDP-DG and Kennedy pathways and in the proportional synthesis of phospholipids and neutral lipids.

Yeast cultures were grown in YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or in complete synthetic medium minus inositol (27Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose at 30 °C. The appropriate amino acid of complete synthetic medium was omitted for selection purposes, and inositol (50 μm) was added to the growth medium where indicated. Escherichia colistrain HB 101 was grown in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added to cultures of HB 101 carrying plasmids. Media were supplemented with either 2% (yeast) or 1.5% (E. coli) agar for growth on plates. Yeast cell numbers in liquid media were determined spectrophotometrically at an absorbance of 540 nm. The sensitivity of yeast strains to CPEC (10 μg) was determined by a standard radial diffusion assay. The Opi (over production ofinositol) phenotype (28Greenberg M. Reiner B. Henry S.A.

Conditions for the amplification of DNA by PCR were optimized as described previously (32Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 3-12Google Scholar). The annealing temperature for PCRs was 52 °C, and extension time was 1 min at 72 °C. PCRs were routinely run for a total of 35 cycles. DNA sequencing reactions were performed with the Prism DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and analyzed with an automated DNA sequencer. Total RNA was extracted from cells (33Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), converted to cDNA by treatment with reverse transcriptase, and then amplified by PCR (34Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 21-27Google Scholar). The primers used forURA7 mRNA (Ura7-A and Ura7-B) produced a 1.7-kb product, and the primers used for URA8 mRNA (Ura8-A and Ura8-B) produced a 0.87-kb product. In order to construct aURA8 disruption vector, the 5′ (primers Ura8-C and Ura8-D) and 3′ (primers Ura8-E and Ura8-F) noncoding regions of theURA8 gene were isolated by PCR using DNA from strain W303-1A as the template. These fragments were digested with BglII and EcoRI and with BamHI and SalI, respectively, and ligated into plasmid pNKY51 to form plasmid pDO183. In order to construct a URA7 expression vector, a 2.49-kb fragment containing the URA7 gene was released from plasmid pFL44S-URA7 by digestion with BamHI andPstI. This fragment was ligated into plasmid YEpLac195 that was digested with the same restriction enzymes to form plasmid pDO134. In order to construct a URA7 disruption vector, a 1.4-kb DNA fragment containing the URA7Δ::TRP1allele (7Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Fasiolo F. Adeline M.-T. Collin J. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was obtained from strain OK8 (8Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) by PCR using primers Ura7-C and Ura7-D. This fragment was blunt-end ligated into pBlueScript II digested with EcoRV to form plasmid pDO163. In order to clone the URA7 open reading frame for mutagenesis experiments, a 1.81-kb DNA fragment containing the URA7 open reading frame was obtained by PCR (primers Ura7-E and Ura7-F) using DNA from strain W303-1A as the template. This fragment was digested withNotI and PstI and ligated into pBlueScript II that was digested with the same restriction enzymes to form plasmid pDO178. A 1.76-kb DNA fragment containing the URA8 open reading frame was obtained by PCR (primers Ura8-G and Ura8-H) using DNA from strain W303–1A as the template. This fragment was blunt-end ligated into pBlueScript II digested with EcoRV to form plasmid pDO179. The primary sequences of the cloned open reading frames of URA7 and URA8 in plasmids pDO178 and pDO179 were verified by DNA sequencing. The URA7E161K (primer Ura7-G and complement) andURA7H233K (primer Ura7-H and complement) andURA8E161K (primer Ura8-I and complement) andURA8H233K (primer Ura8-J and complement) mutations were constructed by PCR using plasmids pDO178 and pDO179, respectively, as templates. The primers for the E161K mutations incorporated an ApaLI restriction site, and the primers for the H233K mutations incorporated an ApaI restriction site. These silent restriction sites were used to identify plasmids with the correct mutations. The URA7E161K,H233K andURA8E161K,H233K mutants were constructed with the appropriate primers for the H233K mutations using theURA7E161K and URA8E161Kmutants, respectively, as templates. The mutated genes were completely sequenced to verify that no additional unwanted mutations were made. The wild-type and mutant alleles of URA7 and URA8were subcloned into an expression shuttle vector containing theADH1 promoter. The ADH1 promoter was isolated from plasmid pDB20 by digestion with BamHI andPstI. This fragment was ligated into plasmid YEpLac181 digested with the same restriction enzymes to form plasmid pDO104. A pair of annealed oligonucleotides (Mcs-A and Mcs-B), which contains additional restriction sites, was ligated into plasmid pDO104 that was digested with NotI and PstI to form plasmid pDO105. The wild-type and mutant alleles of URA7 were released from plasmid pDO178 by digestion with NotI andPstI, and the wild-type and mutant alleles ofURA8 were released from plasmid pDO179 by digestion withNotI and XbaI. These fragments were then ligated into plasmid pDO105, digested with NotI and PstI and NotI and XbaI, respectively, to form the expression shuttle vectors pDO169-pDO176. Aura7Δ ura8Δ double mutant was constructed and used as the host strain for the expression of the wild-type and mutant alleles of the URA7-encoded and URA8-encoded CTP synthetases. A ura8Δ mutant was constructed first. A 4.6-kb SspI fragment of plasmid pDO183, which contained theURA8Δ::HisG/URA3/HisG cassette, was used to transform strain SGY157 to uracil prototrophy.HisG is a 1100-base pair DNA sequence from Salmonella typhimurium which is utilized in direct repeats flankingURA3 to increase the frequency of homologous recombination resulting in the loss of URA3. Colonies were subsequently plated onto media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid, and uracil auxotrophs were recovered. This step selected for theura8Δ::HisG recombination. One of theura8Δ mutants was designated strain SDO159. Strain SDO159 was transformed with plasmid pDO134, which contains a wild-typeURA7 allele. This plasmid was maintained by growth of the strain on plates without uracil. This step was necessary because aura7Δ ura8Δ mutant is not viable (8Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Strain SDO159 bearing plasmid pDO134 was then transformed to tryptophan prototrophy with a 1.34-kb fragment of plasmid pDO163 that was digested with DraI and NaeI. One of the ura7Δura8Δ double mutants was designated strain SDO195. Both mutations were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Strain SDO195, bearing plasmid pDO134, was transformed to leucine prototrophy with the ADH1 expression"

Taking advantage of the selectivity in recognition by these targets between Rho and Rac, we examined the regions in Rho required for selective binding of each class of Rho target molecules. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using Rho/Rac chimeras and either rhophilin, ROCK-I, or citron. This study showed the existence of at least two distinct regions in Rho (amino acids 23–40 and 75–92) that are critical for the selective binding of these targets. The former was required for binding to citron, whereas the latter was necessary for binding to rhophilin. On the other hand, either region showed affinity to ROCK-I. This was further confirmed by ligand overlay assay using both recombinant ROCK-I and ROCK-II proteins. Consistently, Rho/Rac chimeras containing either region can induce stress fibers in transfected HeLa cells, and this induction is suppressed by treatment with Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK kinases. These results suggest that the selective binding of different classes of Rho targets to Rho is determined by interaction between distinct Rho-binding motifs of the targets and different regions of Rho.

The small GTPase Rho functions as molecular switches in various cellular processes. Rho mediates the integrin-dependent cell adhesion of a variety of cells to the substratum, which is typically found as the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers in fibroblasts. Another member of the Rho family proteins, Rac, induces the assembly of small focal complexes at the periphery of cells, and controls the production of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (1Ridley A.J.

Furthermore, it has been reported that Rho is involved in transcriptional activation through the serum response element (9Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1205) Google Scholar), and in cell growth and transformation (10Yamamoto M. Marui N. Sakai T. Morii N. Kozaki S. Ikai K. Imamura S. Narumiya S.

These various activities of Rho appear to be regulated by multiple signaling pathways, which may be driven by multiple effector molecules. Based on selective binding to the GTP-bound form of Rho, we recently isolated several potential Rho target proteins. Using yeast two-hybrid system with Rho as a bait, we isolated a protein serine/threonine kinase PKN and two nonkinase molecules, rhophilin and rhotekin (13Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T.

Interestingly, these proteins possess Rho-binding domains of 70 amino acid-stretch in their N termini, which show 27–40% identity. This conserved Rho-binding motif is called class I to distinguish it from other Rho-binding motifs. We also isolated another serine/threonine protein kinase, p160ROCK, as a [35S]GTPγS-Rho-binding protein using the ligand overlay assay (15Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). This molecule has a serine/threonine kinase domain in its N-terminal region, followed by an approximately 600-amino acid-long α-helix capable of forming a coiled-coil structure, a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif and a pleckstrin homology region in the C terminus. An isozyme of p160ROCK was also isolated and called ROCK-II/ROKα/Rho kinase (16Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol.

The Rho-binding domain of p160ROCK is 81-amino acid-long (aa 934–1015) and is located between a coiled-coil structure and a pleckstrin homology domain (23Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y.

This Rho-binding motif has no homology with the class I motif, thus defining a distinct class of binding motifs for the GTP-bound form of Rho (class II). Using the two-hybrid system, we also isolated a GTP-Rho-interacting molecule defining a third class of Rho-binding motif. This molecule, citron, like ROCK-I and -II, contains a long coiled-coil structure followed by a pleckstrin homology domain and a cysteine-rich region (24Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Rho-binding domain of this protein has been mapped within the coiled-coil region, where no significant homology could be found with the class I or II motifs. These findings suggest that there are at least three classes of Rho targets with distinct Rho-binding motifs. This raises a question about the domains of Rho that interact with these targets; do different classes of Rho-binding motifs bind to an identical effector domain of Rho or does each motif recognize a different region of Rho? To solve this issue, we have determined the regions of Rho that are required for selective binding of each class of Rho target molecules to Rho. [35S]GTPγS (1,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (V-4505), mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibody (M2), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Flag antibody (D-8) were purchased from Sigma, Eastman Kodak Company, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated horse anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Vector Laboratories, and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was from Molecular Probes. Plasmids of pGEX-Val14-Rho73Rac (N-terminal 75 residues from Rho and the remainder from Rac), pGEX-Val12-Rac73Rho, pGEX-Val12-Rac117Rho, pGEX-L63-Rho73Rac90Rho, pGEX-L61-Rac73Rho90Rac, and pGEX-rhoGAP were described previously (25Diekmann D.

As indicated above, the amino acid numbers in Rho/Rac chimeras used in this study are based on those of Rac and not of Rho (Fig. 1). Rho/Rac chimeras used in the present study are shown in Fig. 2. cDNA constructs of these chimeras were prepared as follows. cDNA fragments corresponding to aa 1–24, 22–42, and 40–62 of RhoA, and corresponding to aa 1–22, 20–40, and 38–60 of Rac1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with Val14-RhoA (23Fujisawa K.

Polymerase chain reaction conditions were 95 °C for 3 min, 25 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 58 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, and 72 °C for 2 min. The products were then blunted and ligated into theHincII site of pBluescript SK+(pSK+-Rho1–24, -Rho22–42, -Rho40–62, -Rac1–22, -Rac20–40, and -Rac38–60, respectively). To combine Rho1–24 or Rac1–22, and Rho22–42 or Rac20–40, thePstI-NdeII fragment of pSK+-Rho1–24/-Rac1–22 and theNdeII-PstI fragment of pSK+-Rho22–42/-Rac20–40 were ligated into thePstI site of pSK+ to generate pSK+-Rho42, -Rho21Rac40, and -Rac21Rho42. To combine Rho42, Rho21Rac40, or Rac21Rho42, and Rho40–62 or Rac38–60, the plasmids pSK+-Rho40–62 and -Rac38–60 were digested withEcoRI and blunted, then digested with TspEI. Each of these fragments and the TspEI-PstI fragment of Rho42, Rho21Rac40, or Rac21Rho42 were inserted into the PstI and EcoRV sites of pSK+ to generate pSK+-Rho38Rac60, -Rho21Rac60, -Rho21Rac38Rho62, -Rac21Rho62 and -Rac21Rho38Rac60. Then, to make full-length chimeras, each of these BamHI-PvuII fragments of the above plasmids and each PvuII-EcoRI fragment of Val14-Rho or Val14-Rho73Rac were ligated into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pSK+ to generate pSK+-Rho38Rac, Rho21Rac, Rho21Rac38Rho, Rac21Rho73Rac and Rac21Rho38Rac. For the yeast two-hybrid system, the BamHI-EcoRI fragments of each pSK plasmid DNA (Rho38Rac, Rho21Rac, Rho21Rac38Rho, Rac21Rho73Rac, and Rac21Rho38Rac) were inserted into modified pBTM116 (24Madaule P.

The BamHI-PvuII fragment of pGEX-Rho73Rac90Rho and the PvuII-EcoRI fragment of pGEX-Rac73Rho90Rac were inserted into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of modified pBTM116 to generate Rho90Rac. Similarly the BamHI-PvuII fragment of pGEX-Rac73Rho90Rac and the PvuII-EcoRI fragment of pGEX-Rho73Rac90Rho were ligated into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of modified pBTM116 (Rac90Rho). Finally theBamHI-PvuII fragment of pGEX-Rac73Rho and thePvuII-EcoRI fragment of pGEX-Rho73Rac were inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of modified pBTM116 to generate pBTM116-Rac.Table IPrimers used in polymerase chain reaction for amplification of indicated fragments of Rho or Rac cDNAsNo.FragmentSequence of 5′-primerSequence of 3′-primer1 24 23 221Rho(1–24)GGG CTG CAG GGT ACC ATG GCT GCC ATC CGG AAGA GAC GAT CAG CAA GCA TGT CTT TCC ACA GPstINdeII22 23 2442 41 402Rho(22–42)TG CTG ATC GTC TTC AGC AAG GAC CAG TTCC ATA ATT CTC AAA CAC TGT GGG CACNdeIITspEI40 41 4262 61 603Rho(40–62)T GAG AAT TAT GTG GCA GAT ATC GAG GTGTG CCC AGC TGT GTC CCA CAATspEIPvuII122 21 204Rac(1–22)GGG CTG CAG GGT ACC ATG CAG GCC ATC AAG TGT GACT GAT CAG TAG GCA AGT TTT ACPstINdeII20 21 2240 39 385Rac(20–38)A CTG ATC AGT TAC ACA ACC AAT GA ATA ATT GTC AAA GAC AGT AGG GNdeIITspEI38 39 4060 59 586Rac(38–60)GAC AAT TAT TCT GCC AAT GTT ATGG TCC AGC TGT ATC CCA TAA GTspEIPvuIIAll the sequences listed here are from 5′ to 3′ direction.

For expression of the Rho-binding domain of rhoGAP, the XbaI-HincII fragment of pGEX-rhoGAP was blunted and inserted in-frame into a blunted site of pVP-16. pVP-16 constructs for the Rho-binding domains of rhophilin, ROCK-I, and citron were described previously (13Watanabe G.

These plasmids were stably expressed in the AMR70 strain, which was mated with a L40 strain transformed with a pBTM plasmid containing each of the Rho/Rac chimera constructs. Diploids were subjected to the liquid β-galactosidase assay (27Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The BamHI-EcoRI fragments of each pBTM116 plasmid DNA coding for each Rho/Rac chimera were inserted into pGEX-2T. pQE constructs for the Rho-binding domains of ROCK-I and -II were described previously (23Fujisawa K.

Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the culture when A 600 of the suspension was 0.8, and the culture was continued for another 20 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected and lysed, and the expressed proteins were purified as described previously (23Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The purity of the preparations was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each preparation showed a single major protein band at the expected size (data not sown). His-tagged proteins were dissolved in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Proteins on the membrane were denatured and renatured as described previously (23Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). GlutathioneS-transferase fusion Rho/Rac chimera proteins were loaded with [35S]GTPγS. The renatured membrane was then incubated with 8 nm[35S]GTPγS-loaded-Rho/Rac chimera proteins in an overlay buffer as described (23Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The membrane was washed, dried, and exposed to an x-ray film. TheBamHI-EcoRI fragments from pBTM116 plasmids containing each Rho/Rac chimera cDNA was subcloned into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of a pCMX-flagvector such that the insert would come in-frame to a Flag epitope at the N terminus. A HindIII-EcoRI fragment was excised from each resultant plasmid, blunted, and inserted into the blunted XhoI site of a pCAG-GS to generate a mammalian expression construct driven by a chick β-actin promoter (28Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar). A mammalian expression construct for botulinum C3 exoenzyme was prepared to inhibit the action of endogenous Rho. pET-C3 (29Nemoto Y. Namba T. Kozaki S. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19312-19319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with NdeI and BamHI, blunted, and inserted into the blunted BstXI site of pEF-BOS (30Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) to yield pEF-C3. HeLa cells were plated on a coverglass at a density of 5 × 104 cells per 35-mm dish. After 1 day, the medium was removed and the cells were transfected in Opti-MEM with 1 μg of pCAG-flag, or 0.4 μg of pCAG-flag-Rho/Rac chimeras together with either 0.6 μg of pEF-BOS or 0.4 μg of pEF-C3 and 0.2 μg of pEF-BOS, using LipofectAMINE-DNA coprecipitates. After 2 h incubation, the medium was exchanged with fresh Opti-MEM and cells were cultured for another 22 h. Cells were then fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were double-labeled for F-actin and the Flag epitope by first incubating with an anti-Flag antibody for 60 min in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 60 min in 10% FCS in PBS or for vinculin and the Flag epitope by first incubating with mouse anti-vinculin antibody and rabbit anti-Flag antibody for 60 min in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated horse anti-rabbit IgG for 60 min in 10% fetal calf serum in PBS. The coverslips were mounted in 80% glycerol supplemented with 2% triethylenediamine and cells were examined on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Fluorescent images were recorded on Kodak Ektachrome 400 ASA film. Some of the preparations were analyzed at 0.36 μm optical sections on a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal imaging system and built-up images were constructed. We have recently identified the Rho-binding domain of p160ROCK (ROCK-I) and found that the amino acid sequence of this domain has no homology with those of rhophilin, PKN, or rhotekin, which have the class I Rho-binding motif (14Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), nor to the Rho-binding domain of another Rho-target protein, citron (23Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 24Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This suggested that Rho-target molecules, all showing the selective binding to the GTP-bound form of Rho, could be separated into at least three classes based on the Rho-binding motifs. We designate here the motifs of the Rho-binding domains of ROCK-I and -II as class II and that in citron as class III. This poses a question as to the binding sites of Rho responsible for interaction with each class of target molecules. To investigate which region(s) of Rho determines binding of each class of the Rho targets, we have prepared various chimeras between dominant active mutant forms of Rho and Rac (Fig. 2), and analyzed their binding to various Rho targets in a yeast two-hybrid analysis. Active Rho was foiled with active Rac at about 20-amino acid intervals so that we could identify the Rho region conferring specific binding to Rho. We have chosen the Rho-binding domains of rhophilin, ROCK-I, and citron as representatives of the class I, II, and III domains, respectively, and expressed each as a fusion protein to the VP16 activation domain in the yeast strain AMR70. These transformants were mated with a yeast strain L40 expressing various Rho/Rac chimeras fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain. Interaction was estimated by detection and quantification of β-galactosidase activity. To test that all the Rho/Rac chimeras used here were expressed in yeast and translocated to the nucleus, we used the Rho/Rac-binding domains of p120rhoGAP and kinectin as positive controls (25Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Hotta K. Tanaka K. Mino A. Kohno H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A summary of these analyses are shown in Fig. 2. All the chimeras shown in Fig. 2 interacted with both rhoGAP and kinectin. As both Rho and Rac bind to kinectin, failure of a given chimera in binding to kinectin may indicate that normal conformation is altered in this chimera. Among chimeras tested in the two-hybrid system, four chimeras, Rac90Rho, Rac117Rho, Rho73Rac90Rho and Rac73Rho90Rac, did not show positive binding to kinectin. Their analyses were therefore not included in Fig. 2. Significant interactions with rhophilin were found for Rho, Rho90Rac and Rac73Rho, all of which contained aa 75–92 of Rho. However, under the same conditions, β-galactosidase signals were not detected in the diploids containing chimeras that lacked aa 75–92 of Rho such as Rac or Rho73Rac. These results suggested that aa 75–92 of Rho is necessary for rhophilin to bind to Rho. As for citron, interactions were strong with Rho, Rho90Rac, Rho73Rac, Rho38Rac, Rac21Rho73Rac and Rac21Rho38Rac, all of which contained aa 23–40 of Rho. Only a weak signal was observed with Rho21Rac (Fig. 2). A weak interaction was also found with Rac. This is consistent with our previous finding that Rac-GTPγS binds weakly to citron in a membrane overlay assay (24Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These results imply that aa 23–40 of Rho is critical for high affinity interaction between Rho and citron. However, unlike rhophilin, no requirement of aa 75–92 was observed. These results indicate that the high affinity interactions between Rho-GTP and two different classes of effectors, rhophilin and citron, are determined by two independent target recognition sequences, aa 75–92 and aa 23–40 of Rho. We next examined the target binding determinant of Rho required for binding of the class II Rho target, ROCK-I. Strong color development was found with Rho, Rho90Rac, and Rho73Rac. The interaction was reduced but still significant with Rho38Rac and was abolished with Rho21Rac and Rac (Fig. 2). These results clearly suggested the importance of aa 23–40 of Rho in ROCK binding, similar to the case with citron. Consistently, the binding domain of ROCK-I could bind to Rac21Rho38Rac. A reduction in the interaction was noted when the interaction with Rac21Rho38Rac was compared with that with Rac21Rho73Rac, suggesting that aa 41–75 of Rho may also contribute to some extent. On the other hand, ROCK-I also interacted with Rac73Rho, which did not contain aa 23–75 (Fig. 2), indicating that another binding recognition site to class II molecules was present in a region C-terminal of aa 75. This was consistent with the positive interaction of ROCK-I with Rho21Rac38Rho. To confirm this possibility and identify a region responsible for this interaction, we examined the ROCK-I interaction with Rac73Rho90Rac and compared it with that of Rho73Rac90Rho. The ligand overlay assay was performed, because these two chimeras did not bind to kinectin in the two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 3 A, [35S]GTPγS-bound Rho but not Rac bound to the Rho-binding domain of ROCK-I renatured on the membrane. The binding similar in extent to Rho was found with both Rac73Rho90Rac and Rho73Rac90Rho. These results supported the above idea and revealed that in addition to aa 23–40, aa 75–92 of Rho could provide the binding determinant for ROCK-I. Using the ligand overlay assay, we also examined the binding determinants for ROCK-II. Radioactive binding was seen only in lanes that were overlaid with the chimeras containing either aa 23–40 or aa 75–92 of Rho such as Rac21Rho38Rac and Rac73Rho90Rac (Fig. 3 B). No binding was detected with Rac117Rho, indicating that the binding determinants for ROCK-II, a class-II molecule, were localized to a Rho region N-terminal of aa 119. Thus, the results obtained by the ligand overlay analysis were consistent with those of the two-hybrid system, and indicated that aa 23–40 and aa75–92 of Rho were important in selective binding to both ROCK-I and -II. It remains unclear whether aa 93–119 of Rho plays any role in this binding. To test whether the interactions observed in in vitro assays take place in signal transduction of Rho in situ in the intact cell, we expressed each Rho/Rac chimera in HeLa cells and examined their phenotypes. We and others (19Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 20Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E.

Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) recently showed that the ROCK/ROK/Rho kinase family of kinases work as Rho effectors to induce the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers in cultured cells. Furthermore, we have shown that Rho-dependent induction of stress fibers and focal adhesions is completely suppressed by the pyridine derivative Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of the ROCK isozymes, but that the treatment with this drug does not interfere with Rac-mediated formation of membrane ruffles (22Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Saitoh T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Nakamura I. Yamagami K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 389: 990-994Crossref Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). We therefore used the induction of stress fibers and focal adhesions and its suppression by Y-27632 as a marker of the in vivo interaction of Rho/Rac chimeras with the ROCK family of kinases and examined its correlation with binding in the in vitro systems. The results of these analyses are summarized in Figs. 4 and5. Expression of active Rho in HeLa cells induced both the formation of stress fibers and the assembly of vinculin-containing focal adhesions, both of which were greatly attenuated by treatment with Y-27632 (Figs. 4 and 5 and data not shown). On the other hand, the formation of membrane ruffles mediated by active Rac was resistant to this treatment (Figs. 4 and 5). As shown in Fig. 4, Rho90Rac, Rho73Rac, Rho38Rac, and Rac73Rho, all of which bound to ROCK-I in the two-hybrid system, induced stress fibers, whereas these chimeras did not induce membrane ruffles. Stress fiber formation was also found on expression of Rac73Rho90Rac and Rho73Rac90Rho (data not shown). These results are consistent with the previous study by Diekmann et al. (25Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using Rac73Rho and Rac73Rho143Rac chimeras. On the other hand, consistent with their lack of binding to ROCKs, Rho21Rac and Rac117Rho did not induce stress fibers or focal adhesions but induced membrane ruffles-like structures (Fig. 4 and data not shown). The stress fibers induced by Rho, Rho90Rac, Rho73Rac, and Rho38Rac were all suppressed by treatment with Y-27632 (Fig. 5) and focal adhesions were also reduced in number and size (data not shown). These results demonstrate that all chimeras showing binding to ROCK-I in in vitro induced stress fibers and focal adhesions and that this induction was mediated by activation of endogenous ROCK. Thus, the results obtained by the two-hybrid system and ligand overlay assay correlated well with the expression studies, supporting our proposal that Rho binding to ROCK is controlled through at least two distinct determinant sites, aa 23–40 and aa 75–92. Furthermore, another chimera, Rac90Rho, induced stress fibers in HeLa cells (Fig. 4) that could be suppressed by treatment with Y-27632 (Fig. 5), indicating that aa 93–119 of Rho may also contribute to activate endogenous ROCK as well as aa 75–92 of Rho.Figure 5Effects of treatment with a ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, on morphology of HeLa cells overexpressing active forms of several Rho/Rac chimeras.

Using the Rho-binding domains of citron and rhophilin, a critical interaction determinant for citron was mapped to aa 23–40 of Rho, whereas aa 75–92 of Rho was found to be essential for rhophilin binding. Interaction of another Rho target, ROCK, was mediated independently through either aa 23–40 or aa 75–92 of Rho. The bivalent nature of the Rho-ROCK interaction was confirmed in vivo by monitoring the stress fiber/focal adhesion-forming ability of various Rho/Rac chimeras. The in vivo experiments also suggested the presence of an additional binding determinant for ROCK in aa 93–119. These binding determinants are depicted in Fig. 6. The conformational change of small GTPases has been studied in Ras by the x-ray analysis of crystal structures of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ras (31de Vos A.M. Tong L. Milburn M.V. Matias P.M.

These studies revealed that GTP induced a marked conformational change in two regions, which are called “switch I” and “switch II” regions. In Ras, the switch I region (aa 30–38) overlaps with a domain (aa 32–40) that was identified by mutational studies as a region essential for effector activation. This region includes the interacting site for GAPs, Raf-1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (35Cales C.J. Hancock J.F. Marchall C.J. Hall A.

Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). Switch II in Ras is located at aa 60–76, and this region was suggested to be involved in the interaction with GAP (40Adari H. Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Der C.J. McCormick F. Science. 1988; 240: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Other regions called “activator domains” (approximately corresponding to aa 26–28 and aa 40–49) of Ha-Ras seem to also be required for effector binding. These motifs are exposed on the surface of Ha-Ras, but their conformation is not significantly altered by GDP/GTP exchange (41Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Ito Y. Hattori S. Furuyama S. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4661-4667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignments, we can map the putative switch I region of Rho at aa 32–40 and the putative switch II region at aa 62–78. Our results show that the aa 23–40 region of Rho required for citron binding totally covers the switch I region, whereas the aa 75–92 region essential for rhophilin binding partially overlaps with the switch II region and extends over its C terminus (Fig. 1). In our preliminary yeast two-hybrid study, active Rho with a mutation in switch II region (D76 → Q) reduced the ability to bind, but still bound to rhophilin significantly, suggesting that both switch II and its neighboring C-terminal regions contribute to determination of rhophilin binding. A previous study from our laboratory demonstrated that Rho interaction with rhoGAP was inhibited by the Rho-binding domain of rhotekin (14Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We found that the interaction of Rho with rhoGAP requires Asp65 and Asp67 in the putative switch II region (42Morii N. Kumagai N. Nur-E-Kamal M.S.A. Narumiya S. Maruta H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27160-27163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent x-ray crystallography analysis showed that the binding to rhoGAP of one of the Rho family proteins, Cdc42, was indeed mediated through residue 63 (Gln) located in the switch II region (43Rittinger K.

These results are consistent with the present findings and with the assumption that the binding of class I molecules is determined by the region containing the switch II region of Rho. Flynn et al. (44Flynn P. Mellor H. Palmer R. Panayotou G. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2698-2705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) found PKN contains three repeats of the class I Rho-binding motif and homologous sequences in its N terminus and called them HR1a, 1b and 1c. Using ligand overlay and BIAcore, they found that HR1a interacted strongly with aa 75–145 of Rho in a GTP-dependent manner, whereas HR1b interacted with aa 1–75 of Rho with low affinity and in a GTP-independent manner. Their results are consistent with the present findings because the Rho binding region of rhophilin corresponds to HR1a of PKN. It is evident from the present study that both aa 23–40 and aa 75–119 of Rho work as determinants in binding of the class II molecule, ROCK, to Rho. Consistently, it was reported that Rho with a mutation in the switch I region (T37 → A) did not bind to the Rho-kinase (ROCK-II) (17Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), and that other mutations in the switch I region (F39→A, E40 → L or E40 → W) also abolished the interaction between Rho and ROCK (27Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The Rho family GTPases contain unique sequences called the insert region in their C-terminal half that is not found in Ras. Recently, it was found that the insert region of Rac serves as a novel effector region for one of its effectors, NADPH oxidase (45Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, Diekmann et al. (25Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) showed that aa 143–175 of Rac is required for this interaction. These studies suggest the importance of the C-terminal half of Rac in the effector recognition. However, we have not found any requirement of this part of Rho in interaction with the effectors analyzed in this study. In summary, we have identified Rho regions required for selective interaction of each class of Rho effector molecules. Modification of these regions and manipulation of their interactions may help to dissect the pleiotropic Rho-signaling pathways and to regulate each pathway separately. We are indebted to Stan Hollenberg, Rolf Sternglanz, Stan Fields, and Paul Bartel for the gift of two-hybrid strains, DNA, and detailed protocols, and to Erik Sahai for protocol of the liquid β-galactosidase assay of the yeast two-hybrid system.

We previously showed that sorcin binds to cardiac Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptors and decreases channel open probability in planar lipid bilayers. In addition, we showed that sorcin antibody immunoprecipitates ryanodine receptors from metabolically labeled cardiac myocytes along with a second protein having a molecular weight similar to that of the α1 subunit of cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels. We now demonstrate that sorcin biochemically associates with cardiac and skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channels specifically within the cytoplasmically oriented C-terminal region of the α1 subunits, providing evidence that the second protein recovered by sorcin antibody from cardiac myocytes was the 240-kDa L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunit. Anti-sorcin antibody immunoprecipitated full-length α1 subunits from cardiac myocytes, C2C12 myotubes, and transfected non-muscle cells expressing α1 subunits. In contrast, the anti-sorcin antibody did not immunoprecipitate C-terminal truncated forms of α1 subunits that were detected in myotubes. Recombinant sorcin bound to cardiac and skeletal HIS6-tagged α1 C termini immobilized on Ni2+ resin. Additionally, anti-sorcin antibody immunoprecipitated C-terminal fragments of the cardiac α1 subunit exogenously expressed in mammalian cells. The results identified a putative sorcin binding domain within the C terminus of the α1 subunit. These observations, along with the demonstration that sorcin accumulated substantially during physiological maturation of the excitation-contraction coupling apparatus in developing postnatal rat heart and differentiating C2C12 muscle cells, suggest that sorcin may mediate interchannel communication during excitation-contraction coupling in heart and skeletal muscle."

Substantial evidence exists to suggest that in the basal state GLUT4 resides in discrete storage vesicles.

In the present study we sought to identify the cognate target SNAREs for VAMP2 in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Two plasma membrane-enriched proteins, p25 and p35, were specifically labeled with this probe. By using a combination of immunoblotting, detergent extraction, and anion exchange chromatography, we identified p35 as Syntaxin-4 and p25 as the recently identified murine SNAP-25 homologue, Syndet (mSNAP-23). By using surface plasmon resonance we show that VAMP2, Syntaxin-4, and Syndet form a ternary SDS-resistant SNARE complex. Microinjection of anti-Syndet antibodies into 3T3-L1 adipocytes, or incubation of permeabilized adipocytes with a synthetic peptide comprising the C-terminal 24 amino acids of Syndet, inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface by ∼40%.

Expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and adipocytes, GLUT4 is almost completely sequestered intracellularly under resting or fasting conditions (1James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 607-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in response to muscle contraction (2Ploug T. Galbo H. Vinten J. Jogensen M. Richter E.A. Am. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The regulated movement of GLUT4 in response to insulin is fundamental to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis because defects in this process have been implicated in the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (5DeFronzo R.A.

Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18172-18179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reveal that GLUT4 continually recycles between the cell surface and its intracellular storage site. Under fasting conditions, the majority of GLUT4 is found within intracellular structures comprised of tubulo-vesicular elements that are clustered in thetrans-Golgi network, near sorting endosomes, or in the cytoplasm, often just beneath the plasma membrane (7Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation with insulin there is a rapid translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface, occurring with a t½ of ∼3 min (9Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 259-268Google Scholar).The precise nature of the tubulo-vesicular intracellular GLUT4 compartment is currently under intensive investigation. Two models have been formulated to describe the trafficking and biogenesis of GLUT4 and its storage compartment, and both have been reviewed in detail (10James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 120-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,11Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each model predicts different modes of GLUT4 trafficking, as well as distinct loci of insulin action. The first suggests that under basal conditions, GLUT4 is sequestered within a topologically continuous subdomain of the endosomal system. This model assumes that the trafficking of GLUT4 through the general recycling pathway is regulated by its interaction with other proteins that constitute retention factors. Insulin and/or contraction are predicted to disrupt the interaction between GLUT4 and these retention factors, in turn enabling GLUT4 to re-enter the constitutive recycling pathway and gain access to the cell surface. No specialized vesicular fusion machinery is required to accompany GLUT4 in this model since, presumably, this function would be fulfilled by the constitutive machinery utilized by the endosomal system.The second model suggests that GLUT4 is sorted and packaged into discrete storage vesicles at some stage during transit through the endosomal recycling system. An important feature of this model is that once formed, these vesicles have the potential to dock and fuse directly with the cell surface, independently of the endocytic recycling system. Hence, one predicted loci of insulin action in this model is the machinery that mediates the docking and fusion of GLUT4 containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. Recently, elements of such insulin-regulated docking machinery were identified in adipocytes, and some of these molecules were found to be identical to those used for SSV exocytosis in neurons. These findings have provided strong support for the vesicle model of GLUT4 trafficking and also raised the intriguing possibility that GLUT4 is stored in intracellular vesicles that resemble SSVs. The discovery of vp165 (12Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3328-3332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), an aminopeptidase that co-localizes and traffics identically to GLUT4 in response to insulin, provides additional support for the storage vesicle model.In 1993 Rothman and colleagues (13Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar) proposed the SNARE hypothesis that suggested for all vesicular trafficking events there exists a unique vesicle-bound ligand (v-SNARE) that specifically recognizes and interacts with a unique receptor molecule (t-SNARE) found in the target membrane. The consummation of this reaction was proposed to lead to correct vesicle targeting and ultimately membrane fusion. In the case of SSVs in neurons, such functions are encoded by the v-SNARE VAMP2, which is highly enriched in SSVs, and two t-SNAREs Syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 found at the presynaptic plasma membrane. One of the fundamental tenets of the SNARE hypothesis is that the unique interactions between different sets of v- and t-SNAREs provide the necessary specificity required to ensure that a particular vesicle will dock and fuse with a particular target membrane. Indeed it has since been shown that there are large gene families of v- and t-SNAREs in eucaryotic cells that appear to function at distinct loci throughout the cell. In the post-Golgi recycling pathway in mammalian cells, for example, at least three different v-SNAREs (VAMP1, VAMP2, and cellubrevin) and eight different t-SNAREs (Syntaxin-1, Syntaxin-2, Syntaxin-3, Syntaxin-4, Syntaxin-6, Syntaxin-7, SNAP-25, and Syndet) have been described (reviewed in Ref. 14Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The expression of neuronal VAMP homologues in adipocytes was first reported by Lienhard and colleagues (15Cain C.C. Trimble W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11681-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was later shown that adipocytes express both VAMP2 and an additional v-SNARE, cellubrevin (16Volchuk A. Sargeant R. Sumitani S. Liu Z. He L. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8233-8240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, both proteins appeared to co-localize with GLUT4 in adipocytes (17Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A specific role for VAMP2 in the insulin-dependent translocation of GLUT4 was implicated when it was revealed that the majority of cellubrevin localized to endosomes, as is the case in other cells (18McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2213-2217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), whereas VAMP2 was predominantly co-localized with GLUT4 in a population of vesicles segregated from recycling endosomes (17Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We have proposed that these vesicles sequester GLUT4 from the constitutive recycling pathway and hence refer to them as GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs) (11Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with studies in neurons, we have recently shown that synthetic peptides that comprise unique VAMP2 domains block GLUT4 exocytosis but not the constitutive trafficking of GLUT1 in permeabilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes (19Martin L.B. Shewan A. Millar C.A. Gould G.W. James D.E. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1444-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), thus supporting a unique role for this protein in GLUT4 exocytosis.In view of the central role of VAMP2 in insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking, in the present studies we have attempted to identify VAMP2-binding proteins in adipocytes. Specifically, we sought to identify the cognate t-SNAREs for VAMP2 in adipocyte plasma membranes. By employing the mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line, which exhibits a 10–40-fold increase in cell-surface GLUT4 levels following insulin stimulation (4Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), we have identified Syntaxin-4 and the recently described SNAP-25 homologue Syndet 2Despite exhibiting greatest sequence similarity to the non-neuronal, SNAP-25-like protein, human SNAP-23 (29Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether Syndet and human SNAP-23 represent the product of the same or two closely related genes (see “Results”). 2Despite exhibiting greatest sequence similarity to the non-neuronal, SNAP-25-like protein, human SNAP-23 (29Ravichandran V.

(20Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the two major VAMP2-binding proteins in mouse adipocyte plasma membranes. We show, by using surface plasmon resonance, that VAMP2, Syntaxin-4, and Syndet form an SDS-resistant SNARE complex in vitro. Furthermore, we show that a peptide identical to the C-terminal 24 amino acids of Syndet, or anti-Syndet antibodies, inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by 35–40% in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin dependent trafficking of the constitutively recycling glucose transporter, GLUT1, was unaffected when challenged with the former reagent. Our work provides evidence that Syntaxin-4 and Syndet are major t-SNAREs in adipocytes that mediate GLUT4 mobilization to the plasma membrane in response to insulin and further supports the existence of discrete GSVs.DISCUSSIONSubstantial evidence suggests that VAMP2 acts as a v-SNARE in the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane of adipocytes. Morphologically, there is a high degree of co-localization between VAMP2 and GLUT4 in an intracellular compartment distinct from recycling endosomes which has been referred to as GSVs (17Martin S.

Microinjection of synthetic peptides comprising the unique N terminus of VAMP2 also have a specific effect on GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes (19Martin L.B. Shewan A. Millar C.A. Gould G.W.

Furthermore, overexpression, microinjection, or permeabilized entry of recombinant proteins comprising the VAMP2 cytoplasmic tail inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by as much as 50% (28Macaulay S.L.

In the present study we hypothesized that if GSVs fuse directly with the cell surface in response to insulin then, as predicted from the SNARE hypothesis, the adipocyte plasma membrane should be enriched in VAMP-2-specific t-SNAREs. Furthermore, these adipocyte t-SNAREs should bear some resemblance to the t-SNAREs that regulate docking of synaptic vesicles in the neuron because this process is also mediated by VAMP2.To identify such proteins we have employed far Western blotting using the cytoplasmic domain of VAMP2 and isolated two proteins of relative molecular mass 25 and 35 kDa. By using a series of sequential purification techniques, we have enriched for both of these proteins more than 1000-fold and showed that they are indistinguishable from immunoreactive Syndet and Syntaxin-4, respectively. In the case of Syndet we present functional data to support a role for this protein in the insulin-regulated trafficking of GLUT4. Introduction of either antibodies or a peptide to the C terminus had a significant inhibitory effect. In both cases we observed a 35–40% inhibition of GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 8, a and b). In similar studies, we have observed a comparable degree of inhibition using either the cytoplasmic tail of VAMP2 or a VAMP2-specific peptide (19Martin L.B. Shewan A. Millar C.A. Gould G.W. James D.E. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1444-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Syndet appears to perform a very specific role in the insulin-dependent trafficking of GLUT4 to the cell surface, since even under conditions that maximally inhibited GLUT4 translocation, no inhibition of either the basal or insulin-stimulated trafficking of the constitutively recycling glucose transporter, GLUT1, could be detected (Fig. 8 c). Furthermore, no effect on the basal trafficking of GLUT4 could be discerned. Studies similar to those we have presented here also implicate a role for Syntaxin-4 in the insulin-induced movement of GLUT4 to the cell surface of adipocytes (28Macaulay S.L. Hewish D.R. Gough K.H. Stoichevska V. Macpherson S.F. Jagadish M. Ward C.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Cheatham B. Volchuk A. Kahn C.R. Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Klip A. Proc.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).It has previously been shown that SNAREs play an important role in intracellular vesicular transport reactions at least in part by forming stable ternary complexes. Such complexes are resistant to denaturation by SDS and can be formed even under in vitro conditions using recombinant proteins (31Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 38Pevsner J. Hsu S.-C. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). We sought to determine if Syndet, Syntaxin-4, and VAMP2 could also form such complexes. To achieve this aim we employed SPR. Interestingly, using this technique we found that we were only able to establish such an interaction by immobilizing Syndet onto the chip surface. Our immobilization strategy took advantage of the five cysteines present in the mid-portion of the molecule. We surmise that our ability to form SNARE complexes using this strategy probably reflects the fact that under these conditions Syndet is being preserved in a topology on the chip surface that is close to that normally adopted under its native conditions. This conclusion is supported by studies on the related t-SNARE SNAP25, which appears to be palmitoylated midway between the SNARE binding domains located at its N and C termini (39Veit M. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Based on sequence comparisons, similar SNARE binding domains are present in Syndet (20Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Weimbs T. Hui Low S. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The reconstitution of a ternary SNARE complex on the SPR sensor chip will facilitate the identification of proteins that bind SNAREs at different stages of the assembly process and possibly aid in the elucidation of how these interactions might be modulated by phosphorylation, GTPases, and other factors. In order to implicate a role for Syndet, Syntaxin-4, and VAMP2 in GLUT4 trafficking, it will be necessary to demonstrate that they form a ternary complex in vivo, and this is a major direction of our current work.One of the curious findings in the present study was that in our functional analyses of Syndet in GLUT4 trafficking, we observed at most a 40% inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. It is of interest that this is in line with the effects of reagents that disrupt the function of either VAMP2 or Syntaxin-4 on GLUT4 trafficking (19Martin L.B. Shewan A. Millar C.A. Gould G.W. James D.E. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1444-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,28Macaulay S.L. Hewish D.R. Gough K.H. Stoichevska V. Macpherson S.F. Jagadish M. Ward C.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the one hand this may simply reflect the experimental limitations of our approach where peptides or recombinant fusion proteins have been incubated with permeabilized cells. It is more likely, however, that this lack of complete inhibition reflects the function of Syndet in adipocytes. One interpretation is that only 40% of intracellular GLUT4 is susceptible to the actions of the Syndet peptide. A similar explanation has been advanced in studies on SNAP25 in neuroendocrine cells where it was shown that a peptide, analogous to that used in this study, specifically inhibited the fusion of only undocked and not pre-docked vesicles, the former constituted only 30% of the total releasable pool (32Gutierrez L.M. Viniegra S. Rueda J. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Canaves J.M. Montal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2634-2639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Such an explanation would appear to be unlikely for adipocytes, however, as there is no morphological evidence for pre-docked GLUT4-containing vesicles (7Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility therefore, as indicated by recent studies using a horseradish peroxidase conjugate of transferrin (17Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 19Martin L.B. Shewan A. Millar C.A. Gould G.W. James D.E. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1444-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), is that GLUT4 exists within at least two intracellular compartments, one is endosomal and thus co-localizes with transferrin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, and the other is a post-endocytic compartment that is inaccessible to transferrin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. Up to 40% of intracellular GLUT4 has been calculated to be present in the former compartment. We suggest that it is only the latter compartment that is regulated by Syndet, and in turn sensitive to the presence of our Syndet blocking reagents. Consistent with this suggestion is the observation that GLUT1, a molecule believed to traffic via endosomes, is completely unaffected in our GLUT4 trafficking assays. It is worth mentioning that there is no direct evidence that GLUT4 in this post-endocytic compartment traffics directly to the cell surface rather than merging with endosomes en route. If the latter is true, a role for Syndet at an intracellular location needs to be considered as an additional possibility. We cannot exclude this possibility, particularly since we do observe some Syndet and Syntaxin-4 in the HDM fraction and, although contaminated to some extent with plasma membranes, this fraction also contains fluid phase endosomal markers. Against such a proposition, however, is the observation that the majority of Syndet and Syntaxin-4 is found at the cell surface. Hence, it is quite conceivable that the Syndet peptide and antibody used in this study have quite a significant effect on the ability of vesicles derived from the post endocytic compartment to dock and fuse with the plasma membrane.Whereas we have proven a role for Syndet in GLUT4 trafficking, the function of this protein in this process remains unknown. In an attempt to determine if the Syndet C-terminal peptide was interfering with the formation of a functional Syntaxin-4, Syndet, and VAMP2 SNARE complex, we assessed the effect of this peptide on the formation of this complexin vitro using our SPR assay. Paradoxically, we were unable to detect any measurable effect using this strategy (data not shown). Suffice to say, this observation does not preclude the possibility of an effect of this peptide on SNARE assembly in vivo. It is conceivable that in certain micro-environments the Syndet peptide might undergo a major conformational rearrangement. It is believed, for example, that during vesicle fusion the activation of lipid kinases might alter the microacidity surrounding the fusion site. Limitations of the SPR carboxy dextran chip surface at low pH precluded our ability to test this hypothesis. More likely, however, are the possibilities that the Syndet peptide functions to inhibit a step just after individual SNARE complexes have formed. If the C terminus of Syndet, for example, functions as an oligomerization domain, but only after ternary SNARE complexes have formed, then the effect of the Syndet peptide would have gone unrecognized on the SPR chip surface. Higher order SDS-resistant ternary SNARE complexes have already been describedin vitro (31Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several groups have also implicated a role for the C terminus of SNAP-25 in a post-docking, fusion-catalyzing reaction (41Banerjee A. Kowalchyk J.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J.

Some evidence exists to suggest the last 20 amino acids of this protein may play a role in Rab binding (44Johannes L. Doussau F. Clabecq A. Henry J.-P. Darchen F. Poulain B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2875-2884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or in activation of lipid-modifying reactions (45Ray P. Berman J.D. Middleton W. Brendle J. J. Biol.

The similarity between the multimer forming fusion peptides of viral fusogenic proteins and the C termini of SNAP-25-like proteins is also very interesting (46Durell R.S. Martin I. Ruysschaert J.-M.

It is presently unclear how this signal is recognized and what type of vesicle transports lamp-1 and lamp-2. Here, we describe a method to generate transport vesicles containing lamp proteins from the TGNin vitro. The method is based on incorporation of radioactive sialic acid in glycoproteins at the TGN by incubation of membranes with tritiated CMP-sialic acid. The generation of vesicles from labeled membranes required ATP and cytosol, and was temperature-dependent and brefeldin A-sensitive. Analysis on Nycodenz gradients revealed that lamp-vesicles were distinct from vesicles containing γ-adaptin and mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR). Moreover, both these types of vesicles migrated differently than vesicles containing proteins destined for the plasma membrane. The conclusion that lamps and MPRs are sorted into different vesicles was further strengthened by the finding that whereas wortmannin bothin vitro and in vivo inhibited the production of γ-adaptin/MPR-containing vesicles, this drug had no effect on the generation of lamp-vesicles and on the sorting of lamps.

At this site, newly synthesized proteins are targeted to their appropriate destinations by incorporation into transport vesicles, mainly through the recognition of specific signals in the proteins. The general view is that the lack of a sorting signal in a protein leads to vesicular transport by default to the cell surface, referred to as the constitutive pathway. All other pathways originating at the TGN, such as those leading to endosomes/lysosomes, storage granules, and apical and basolateral plasma membranes in polarized cells, are believed to require specific structures in the proteins to be sorted (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar and 2Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A common theme for selective vesicular transport is that cargo molecules to be sorted are concentrated in budding structures in the membrane through interaction with receptor molecules. On the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, coat proteins are assembled which are believed to drive the formation of the vesicle. At least in some cases, a direct interaction between cargo and coat proteins seems to be responsible for the specificity of the sorting reaction (3Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 4Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The sequence of events leading to the generation of a transport vesicle has been a subject of intense studies during recent years. A key factor for initiation of the assembly of several types of coats is the small cytosolic G-protein ARF (ADP-ribosylating factor) (5Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12083-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin.

When activated by exchange of GTP for GDP by a brefeldin A-sensitive GTP exchange factor, ARF binds to the membrane and triggers the assembly of the coat by a mechanism that is not yet fully elucidated. Several studies have indicated the active involvement of lipid molecules in the formation of transport vesicles. One class of molecules which has a putative role in different vesicle systems is the 3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols (8Shepherd P.R. Reaves B.J. Davidson H.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Several types of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases have been identified, some of which are inhibited by the drug wortmannin (11Martys J.L. Wjasow C. Gangi D.M. Kielian M.C. McGraw T.E. Backer J.M. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). When added to cells, this drug affects, among other processes, the sorting of lysosomal hydrolases at the TGN, resulting in the secretion of the enzymes to the medium (13Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which wortmannin affects endosomal sorting at the TGN is not known. Of several types of vesicles known to form at the TGN, only the clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) have been reasonably well characterized (reviewed in Refs. 15Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 16Brodsky F.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 175-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The assembly of clathrin is triggered by the binding of heterotetrameric complexes of adaptor proteins (AP) to the membrane. The adaptor complex specific to the TGN is designated AP-1 and consists of β1, γ, μ1, and ς1 chains (called adaptins). The μ1-adaptin of AP-1 is thought to directly bind to signal sequences in the cytoplasmic domains of cargo molecules, thereby trapping them in the growing bud. A similar system, involving clathrin and an analogous adaptor complex (AP-2), is responsible for the uptake of molecules from the plasma membrane by endocytosis. The best described cargo molecules in AP-1-containing vesicles are the trans-membrane mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) (18Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 19Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). These receptors recycle between the TGN and endosomes, and act as a shuttle system for newly synthesized, mannose 6-phosphate-modified, lysosomal hydrolases. Two different MPRs, MPR46 and MPR300, both have in their cytoplasmic tails signal sequences that are responsible for the accumulation of the molecules in CCVs. Recent studies have shown that the cytoplasmic tails of MPRs are important determinants for the generation of clathrin vesicles at the TGN per se, indicating that the cargo molecules may drive the formation of its own transport vesicle (20Le Borgne R.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Apart from the water-soluble hydrolases, several newly synthesized lysosomal membrane proteins are also sorted at the TGN (22D'Souza M.P. August J.T. Arch. Biochem.

Lysosome-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 (lamp-1 and lamp-2) are related major molecules in the lysosomal membrane, and consist of two heavily glycosylated amino-terminal lumenal domains, a single trans-membrane domain, and a short (11 amino acids) cytoplasmic tail (18Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 27Carlsson S.R. Roth J. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

The signal for sorting is contained within the carboxyl-terminal tail and has the following features critical for recognition by the sorting machinery: a tyrosine located as the fourth residue from the end, a large hydrophobic amino acid as the last residue, and a glycine residue amino-terminal to the tyrosine residue (25Harter C. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 26Höning S. Hunziker W. J.

In addition, the distance from the tyrosine to the membrane seems to be of importance for the signal to be functional at the TGN (31Guarnieri F.G. Arterburn L.M. Penno M.B. Cha Y. August J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1941-1946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In certain cells, the sorting of lamps at the TGN is inefficient and a fraction of the molecules follows the default pathway to the cell surface. There, the lamps are taken up by endocytosis through a less strict recognition of the same tyrosine-containing signal, and are finally delivered to lysosomes (24Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Harter C. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 32Nabi I.R. Le Bivic A.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mechanism for recognition of the tyrosine signal of lamps at the TGN is not known. A key question is whether lamps utilize the same vesicles as MPRs, or if other pathways exist for intracellular transport of molecules from the TGN to the endosomal system. Although MPRs do have tyrosine-containing signal sequences in their cytoplasmic tails, they seem not to be important for TGN sorting (34Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 36Chen H.J. Remmler J. Delaney J.C. Messner D.J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22338-22346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, the major sorting motif in MPRs is a di-hydrophobic sequence, or a recently described acidic sequence, located close to the carboxyl terminus (37Mauxion F. Le Borgne R. Munier-Lehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2171-2178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 38Chen H.J. Yuan J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7003-7012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the relationship between MPR and lamp sorting in living cells, we took advantage of the finding that the intracellular MPR-dependent sorting of lysosomal hydrolases is sensitive to wortmannin (13Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We confirm that cathepsin D is missorted and secreted to medium in the presence of wortmannin. In contrast, we find that the transport of lamp-1 to the lysosomes is unaffected by the drug. Furthermore, by analysis of TGN vesicles derived in vitro, we could show that lamps are incorporated in vesicles that are different from both plasma membrane-destined vesicles and MPR46/γ-adaptin-containing vesicles. Therefore, at least in the hematopoietic cells investigated, vesicular carriers different from that used by lysosomal hydrolases and MPRs transport lamps from the TGN to the endosomal system. Rabbit antibodies against lamp-1, lamp-2, and leukosialin were as described (39Dahlgren C. Carlsson S.R. Karlsson A. Lundqvist H. Sjölin C. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12779-12786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse anti-galactosyltransferase monoclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. E. G. Berger (University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland). Goat anti-MPR46 polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. K. von Figura (Georg-August-University, Göttingen, Germany). Monoclonal antibodies against γ-adaptin was purchased from Sigma. Anti-(cathepsin D) was from Calbiochem. Secondary peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-(mouse immunoglobulins) and rabbit anti-(goat immunoglobulins) antibodies were both from DAKO, and donkey anti-(rabbit immunoglobulin) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Endosomes were labeled by incubation of HL-60 cells with the fluid phase marker FITC-dextran (M r 70,000, Sigma) (41Marsh M. Schmid S. Kern H. Harms E. Male P. Mellman I. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). FITC-dextran was dialyzed overnight against PBS and used at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml in RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min (to label early endosomes) or 20 min (to label late endosomes). At the end of the labeling period the cells were immediately cooled and washed with ice-cold PBS. FITC-dextran in gradient fractions was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. Endoplasmic reticulum was determined by immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized leukosialin from cells pulse-labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine, as described (40Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12779-12786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membrane was determined by immunoblotting with antibodies against leukosialin, which predominantly is displayed at the cell surface at steady state (40Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12779-12786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Golgi membranes were determined by immunoblotting with antibodies against galactosyltransferase.trans-Golgi network was measured by sialyltransferase activity, using asialofetuin as substrate, as described (42Schachter H. Narasimhan S. Gleeson P. Vella G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 98-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and lysosomes were measured by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity, using 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminide as substrate (23Green S.A. Zimmer K.-P. Griffiths G. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells (0.5–1 ml of packed cells), cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), were washed twice in PBS and once in HES buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 msucrose). The cells were resuspended in 3 ml of HES buffer and homogenized in a ball-bearing device (43Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was collected and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was washed twice with SHM buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm MgAc2) by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The membranes were resuspended in 80 μl of SHM buffer and incubated for 40 min at 30 °C with 600 pmol of dried CMP-[3H]sialic acid (21.3 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). The radiolabeled membranes were washed twice with SHM before further use. The radiolabeled membranes were either used directly for generation of vesicles (see below), or further purified. The membranes, resuspended in SHM buffer (150–200 μl), was placed on top of a 4-ml 10–60% (w/v) continuous sucrose gradient in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and centrifuged at 50,000 × g av for 15 min in a SW 60 rotor. The gradient was fractionated into 17 fractions (250 μl each) and analyzed for or- ganelle markers. Fractions containing protein-bound radioactivity (fractions 4–6 from the bottom) were combined, diluted 4-fold with water, and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of SHM buffer and placed on top of an 11-ml 10–50% (w/v) continuous gradient of Nycodenz (Sigma) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.25m sucrose. After equilibrium centrifugation for 18 h at 150,000 × g av in a SW 41 rotor, the gradient was fractionated into 15 fractions (800 μl each) and analyzed for organelle markers and radioactivity. Fractions containing the highest protein-bound radioactivity (fractions 7–8 from the bottom) were pooled and diluted 4-fold with water, centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in SHM for further use. The pool of TGN membranes from the Nycodenz gradient (banding at 1.17–1.19 g/cm3) contained 28% of the protein-bound label, 13% of late endosomes, and 4% of early endosomes, compared with PNS. Plasma membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes were removed in the sucrose gradient and were not detected in Nycodenz fractions (<1%). HL-60 cells were washed twice in PBS and once in HES buffer, and the cell pellet was resuspended in one volume of HES buffer. The cells were frozen in an ethanol bath at –50 °C and thawed in a 37 °C water bath before being pulled through a 21-gauge needle 30 times. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g av for 1 h in a SW 60 rotor, and the supernatant was collected. The cytosol was stored in aliquots in liquid nitrogen. Incubations (200 μl) were carried out in Eppendorf tubes for 40 min at 37 °C in the presence of labeled membranes (added as a 50-μl suspension, corresponding to material from 100–200 μl of packed cells, see above), 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgAc2, 10 mg/ml cytosol (or 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), together with ATP and an ATP regeneration system (final concentrations 1 mm ATP, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, reagents from Boehringer Mannheim). In experiments with no ATP, 30 units/ml apyrase (Sigma) was added to remove ATP in the cytosol. When used, GTPγS was at 100 μm and brefeldin A was at 25 μm. After incubation, 1 ml of HES buffer was added and the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. Either the vesicle supernatant was centrifuged for 2 h at 100,000 × g in a SW 60 rotor and the pelleted vesicles solubilized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride in PBS), or it was subjected to density gradient centrifugation. The vesicle supernatant was placed on top of an 11-ml continuous 5–25% (w/v) Nycodenz-gradient in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.25m sucrose. After equilibrium centrifugation for 18 h at 150,000 × g av in a SW 41 rotor, the gradient was fractionated into approximately 16 fractions (750 μl each) from the bottom of the tube. The refraction index was measured for each fraction before 4-fold dilution with water and centrifugation for 2 h at 100,000 × g in a SW 60 rotor. The pellets were solubilized as described above. Cells were washed twice in PBS and once in 116 mm NaCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 6 mm glucose, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mmMgCl2, pH 7.8, and resuspended in 1.5 ml of the same buffer. The cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, after which 0.5 mCi of [35S]sulfate (1600 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was added and the cells were pulse-labeled for 3.5 min at 37 °C. The labeling was stopped by the addition of sodium sulfate to 5 mm, and the label was chased by further incubation at 37 °C. At various time points, cells and medium were separated by centrifugation at 350 × g for 5 min. Protein-bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting after precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride (44Graham J.M. Winterbourne D.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Preparation of [35S]sulfate-labeled membranes for use in vesicle generation was made by pulse labeling of cells as above, after which the cells were homogenized and membranes were isolated as for [3H]sialic acid-labeled membranes. Chondroitinase digestion was performed by incubation of a cell lysate, prepared as above, at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of 1 unit/ml of chondroitinase ABC (Boehringer Mannheim). The reaction was stopped by boiling in sample buffer for electrophoresis. K562 cells were washed twice in methionine/cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of the same medium. Fifty μl (0.5 mCi) of PRO-MIX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the cells were pulse-labeled for 10 min. The labeling was stopped by the addition of 10 ml of complete medium, and the incubation was continued for various periods of time. In cathepsin D experiments, the chase medium was supplemented with 5 mmmannose 6-phosphate to prevent binding to cell surface-exposed MPRs. When present, wortmannin (Sigma) was at 2 μm in both pulse and chase medium. At harvest, cells and medium were separated by centrifugation. For determination of cell-associated cathepsin D, cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin, 10 μm benzamidine, 1 μm o-phenanthroline, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. The medium was adjusted to 1% Nonidet P-40, and used for immunoprecipitation after centrifugation as for the cells. For determination of the total amount of lamp-1 in cells and in lysosomes, cells were homogenized and PNS was prepared as described above. To part of the PNS (one-fourth) was added Nonidet P-40 to 0.5% together with protease inhibitors, and the samples were treated as for cells described above. Lysosomes were isolated from the rest of the PNS (three-fourths) by density centrifugation in 25% (v/v) Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (24Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fractions with the highest β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity (lower fourth of the gradient) were pooled and treated as described (24Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The pooled fractions contained approximately 70% of the total β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity. Control experiments showed that K562 behaved essentially as HL-60 cells in terms of transport kinetics of lamp-1 (24Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Of the lamp-1 molecules that were isolated in the dense fractions at steady state (approximately 50–60% of total lamp-1), the majority reached the lysosomes by a fast intracellular pathway that was completed after 1–2 h. A minor part of lamp-1 arrived to the lysosomes by slow kinetics (half-time > 2 h), consistent with the passage through the plasma membrane. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (24Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Total radioactive protein from [3H]sialic acid-labeled membranes was obtained by precipitation with 5% trichloroacetic acid in Eppendorf tubes. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 ×g. After one wash with 5% trichloroacetic acid, the samples were boiled in sample buffer for electrophoresis and measured for radioactivity in the scintillation counter, or analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis was performed as described (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed by transferring proteins from the gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semi-dry apparatus. Enzyme-linked secondary antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence exposures using a GS-250 Molecular Imager system (Bio-Rad). Quantitation of the digitized images was made by computer program Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad). Radioactive proteins in gels were detected either by fluorography, by the Molecular Imager system, or by cutting of the gel in small pieces followed by extraction in Solvable (NEN Life Science Products) and scintillation counting as described (24Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The effect of wortmannin on the sorting of cathepsin D and lamp-1 was studied by pulse-chase experiments on K562 cells. Cathepsin D is normally synthesized as a proenzyme of 53 kDa, which, after sorting at the TGN by recognition of its mannose 6-phosphate residues, is processed to a 47-kDa intermediate form, and subsequently to a two-chain mature form of 31 kDa/14 kDa in the lysosomes (46Gieselmann V. Pohlmann R. Hasilik A. von Figura K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Confirming previously published results (13Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we found that wortmannin caused the secretion of cathepsin D (Fig. 1). In the presence of the drug, the proform of cathepsin D started to accumulate in the medium after 2 h of chase and reached a maximum after 4 h of chase. Without wortmannin, the majority of cathepsin D was present intracellularly at all time points (Fig. 1), and processing to the mature form indicated its arrival to the lysosomes after 4 h of chase (data not shown). Since a previous study showed that the synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate and its recognition by MPR is unaffected by the drug (14Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the result indicates an effect of wortmannin on the mechanism of MPR sorting at the TGN. If lysosomal membrane proteins were using the same mechanism for transport, wortmannin would affect the kinetics for arrival to the lysosomes of newly synthesized lamps. A consequence of missorting of lamp-1 at the TGN would be that the molecules are forced to use a slower route to the lysosomes through the cell surface (24Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the result on cathepsin D, no difference was found in the transport kinetics of lamp-1 to the lysosomes with or without the presence of wortmannin (Fig. 1). This may indicate that lamp-1 and MPRs are using different mechanisms for vesicle incorporation at the TGN. The results on the effect of wortmannin in living cells argue for the presence of two different intracellular routes for transport of molecules from the TGN to the endosomal compartments. If lamps and MPRs are inco"

Isolated subunits of factor VIIIa were examined for their ability to accelerate the factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X. The A2 subunit enhanced the k cat for this conversion by 100-fold whereas the K m for factor X was unaffected. The apparent K d for the interaction of A2 subunit with factor IXa was ∼300 nm. Similar results were obtained using purified A2 expressed as the isolated domain in Chinese hamster ovary cells, although this material was less stable than the factor VIIIa-derived material. Isolated A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits showed no effect on the rate of factor X conversion. A2 subunit increased the fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein-Phe-Phe-Arg-factor IXa (Δr = 0.015) and markedly increased anisotropy in the presence of factor X (Δr = 0.057), suggesting that it contributes to the orientation of the factor IXa active site and its relation to substrate. A synthetic peptide to A2 residues 558–565 inhibited the A2-dependent enhancement of factor X activation with an IC50 = 40 μm, a value similar to its K i for inhibition of the intrinsic factor Xase (105 μm). These results indicate that the isolated A2 subunit modulates the active site of factor IXa and identifies a functional role for this subunit in factor VIIIa.

These results indicate that the isolated A2 subunit modulates the active site of factor IXa and identifies a functional role for this subunit in factor VIIIa. Factors VIII and IX are essential plasma proteins that when deficient or defective result in hemophilia A and B, respectively. The activated forms of these proteins, factor IXa (a serine protease) and factor VIIIa 1The factor VIIIa nomenclature is based on the domainal structure designated by A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. Factor VIIIa subunits are designated as A1 (residues 1–372), A2 (residues 373–740), and A3-C1-C2 (residues 1690–2332) with noncovalent subunit associations denoted by a slash mark (/) and covalent associations by a hyphen (-). 1The factor VIIIa nomenclature is based on the domainal structure designated by A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. Factor VIIIa subunits are designated as A1 (residues 1–372), A2 (residues 373–740), and A3-C1-C2 (residues 1690–2332) with noncovalent subunit associations denoted by a slash mark (/) and covalent associations by a hyphen (-). (a protein cofactor), form a Ca2+- and anionic phospholipid-dependent complex referred to as the intrinsic factor Xase complex that efficiently converts zymogen factor X to the serine protease, factor Xa (see Ref. 1Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). The role of the phospholipid surface is to primarily reduce the K mfor substrate, whereas factor VIIIa increases thek cat for this reaction by several orders of magnitude (2van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor VIIIa is a non-covalent heterotrimer composed of the A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 subunits (3Lollar P. Parker C.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 4Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits retain the divalent metal ion-dependent linkage responsible for the association of the heavy and light chains in heterodimeric factor VIII and can be isolated as a stable dimer (5Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A2 subunit is weakly associated with the dimer (K d ∼260 nm(7Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and at physiologic pH it readily dissociates, resulting in the loss of factor VIIIa activity (4Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J.

Parker E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12481-12486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the appropriate reaction conditions of slightly acidic pH and low ionic strength, factor VIIIa activity can be efficiently reconstituted from the isolated A2 subunit and the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (4Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Blood. 1992; 79: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor Xase activity is labile and has been referred to as self-damping (12Jesty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17539-17544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas factor VIIIa-independent conversion of factor X by factor IXa is relatively stable. Association of factor VIIIa with factor IXa in the presence of phospholipid and Ca2+ stabilizes cofactor activity (13Lollar P. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Blood. 1984; 63: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, reconstitution of heterotrimeric factor VIIIa from the isolated A2 subunit and A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer is enhanced severalfold in the presence of factor IXa and phospholipid (10Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two factor IXa-interactive sites have been identified in factor VIII(a). One site, localized to residues 1811–1818 in the A3 domain of the factor VIII light chain (14Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), appears to be the dominant contributor to the interprotein affinity because isolated light chain exhibits a similar affinity for factor IXa (K d ∼15 nm (15Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) as is observed for the intact factor VIIIa (K d ∼2 nm (16Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The second site, localized to residues 558–565 of the A2 subunit (domain) (17Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is poorly characterized in its interaction with the protease. Thus one mechanism proposed for the factor IXa-dependent stabilization of factor VIIIa is the tethering of these interactive sites by the enzyme (10Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18O'Brien L.M. Medved L.V. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27087-27092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The resulting increased interfactor VIIIa subunit affinity reduces subunit dissociation, a predominant mode of factor Xase decay (19Fay P.J. Beattie T.L. Regan L.M. O'Brien L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6027-6032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), effectively promoting substrate turnover. However, prolonged interaction of factor VIII(a) with factor IXa results in a loss of cofactor activity because of proteolytic cleavage within the A1 domain (subunit) at Arg336 (20O'Brien D.P. Johnson D. Byfield P. Tuddenham E.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus factor IXa modulates factor VIIIa activity, thereby affecting the catalytic efficiency of factor Xase. Although interactive sites in the factor VIIIa-factor IXa enzyme complex have been identified, little is known about the contributions made by the factor VIIIa subunits that result in the marked increase ink cat when cofactor is present. Earlier results from our laboratory indicated that the A2 subunit in factor VIII likely interacts with the serine protease domain in factor IXa (18O'Brien L.M. Medved L.V. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Studies presented in this report, undertaken to dissect interactions of individual factor VIIIa subunits with factor IXa, show that the isolated A2 subunit associates with the protease in the absence of other factor VIIIa subunits. The result of this interaction is an approximate 100-fold enhancement in the rate of substrate factor X conversion by a mechanism affecting k cat rather than K m. This functional effect is unique to A2 and is not observed with the other factor VIIIa subunits. These results support a model in which the A2 subunit of factor VIIIa contributes to catalysis within factor Xase by altering the orientation of the active site of factor IXa relative to substrate.

The murine monoclonal antibody R8B12, which reacts with the C-terminal region of the factor VIII A2 domain (6Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol.

The synthetic peptide SVDQRGNQ, which corresponds to factor VIII residues 558–565 (FVIII558–565), and a scrambled sequence version of the peptide (QRVSNGQD) were prepared by Quality Controlled Biochemicals. Phospholipid vesicles containing 20% PS, 40% PC, and 40% PE were prepared using octyl glucoside as described previously (23Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The reagents α-thrombin, factor IXaβ, factor X, and factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories), Fl-FFR-factor IXa (Molecular Innovations), hirudin and phospholipids (Sigma), and the chromogenic substrate S-2765 (N-α-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-arginyl-l-glycyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide-dihydrochloride; Kabi-Pharmacia) were purchased from the indicated vendors. The factor IXa incorporated >0.9 mol eq of dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone, indicating a high specific activity for this preparation of enzyme. The KogenateTM concentrate was fractionated to separate factor VIII from albumin following S-Sepharose chromatography (24Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor VIII was converted to factor VIIIa using thrombin as described (4Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the A2 subunit and A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer by Mono S chromatography was as described (25Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The A1 and A3-C1-C2 were prepared from the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer following dissociation of the dimer by EDTA and chromatography on Mono Q (25Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A2CHO was purified from serum-free culture medium following application to an R8B12 immunoaffinity column attached in series to an S-Sepharose column as described (26O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified A2 was essentially homogeneous (>95% pure) as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 0.1 mg of A2 was obtained from 200 ml of culture supernatant. In some instances, proteins were concentrated using a MicroCon concentrator (Millipore, 10-kDa cut-off). Factor VIII activity was measured by a one-stage clotting assay using plasma that had been chemically depleted of factor VIII activity as described previously (27Casillas G. Simonetti C. Pavlovsky A. Coagulation. 1971; 4: 107-111Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Blue dye binding method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was monitored in a purified system (29Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Factor VIIIa subunits were reacted with factor IXa (5 nm) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.01% Tween (Buffer A) in the presence of 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 μm PS·PC·PE vesicles. Time course reactions were initiated with the addition of factor X (see figure legends for reactant concentrations). Aliquots were removed at appropriate times to assess initial rates of product formation and added to tubes containing EDTA (80 mm final concentration) to stop the reaction. Rates of factor Xa generation were determined by addition of the chromogenic substrate, S-2765 (0.46 mm final concentration). Reactions were read at 405 nm using a V max microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). The affinity of A2 subunit for factor IXa was determined from the rate of factor Xa generation as a function of A2 concentration. Data were fitted to a single site ligand model where, amount bound = capacity × free/K d + free, using the Marquart algorithm and UltraFit software (BioSoft). Because the concentration of A2 subunit was ≫ concentration of factor IXa for all A2 levels, the value for free A2 used the total A2 concentration. For this reason the K d determined is an apparent K d. Using these conditions, the capacity term reflects the maximal rate enhancement at saturating A2 subunit. Data from initial rate kinetics were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (UltraFit) to determine K m andk cat parameters. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made using a SPEX Fluorolog 212 spectrometer operated in the L format. The excitation wavelength was 495 nm (5 nm band pass), and the emission wavelength was 520 nm (14.4 nm band pass). Reactions (0.2 ml) were carried out at room temperature in Buffer A containing 30 nm Fl-FFR-IXa, 50 μm PS·PC·PE vesicles, and the indicated concentrations of A2 subunit and factor X in a quartz microcell. Anisotropy measurements were made by manually rotating the polarizers and monitoring fluorescence for 5 s at each position. Fluorescence intensity determinations (3Lollar P. Parker C.G.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were made at each position and the average value obtained. Blank readings for the buffer containing phospholipid were subtracted from all determinations. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) with a Bio-Rad minigel electrophoresis system. Electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V for 45 min. Bands were visualized following staining with silver nitrate. Densitometric scans were performed using a Beckman DU 650 spectrophotometer equipped with Gel Scan software. Factor VIIIa subunits were isolated as described under “Materials and Methods.” SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis visualized by silver staining indicated the subunits were of high purity (Fig. 1). One-stage clotting assays using the individual subunits showed no activity indicating the subunit preparations were free of factor VIIIa. The isolated A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 subunits were separately titrated into reaction mixtures containing factor IXa (5 nm), PS·PC·PE vesicles (10 μm), and factor X (200 nm), and rates of factor Xa generation were determined using a chromogenic assay. Results in Fig. 2 show that inclusion of A2 subunit yielded a dose-dependent increase in the rate of factor X generation, suggesting that association of the isolated A2 subunit with factor IXa altered the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Fitting the data to a single-site ligand binding model yielded an apparent K d of 314 ± 89 nm. The extent of maximal rate enhancement extracted from the curve (2.6 ± 0.4 nm factor Xa formed per min) indicated an approximate 100-fold increase compared with the rate of substrate conversion in the absence of A2 subunit (0.028 ± 0.005 nm factor Xa formed per min). Neither the A1 nor the A3-C1-C2 subunit affected the rate of factor IXa-catalyzed conversion of factor X over the concentration ranges employed. In fact, increasing levels of A1 subunit actually resulted in a slight (∼2-fold) reduction in the rate of factor Xa generation. One explanation for this observation is that the A1 subunit is a substrate for factor IXa cleavage at Arg336 (21Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus rate reduction of factor X conversion in the presence of A1 subunit may occur by competition between these factor IXa substrates.Figure 2Effect of isolated factor VIIIa subunits on factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X. Factor Xa generation assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods” in a reaction containing 5 nm factor IXa, 200 nmfactor X, 10 μm PS·PC·PE vesicles, and the indicated concentrations of A3-C1-C2 (triangles), A1 (squares), or A2 (circles) subunits. Aliquots were removed at various time points up to 1 h and used to calculate the amount of factor Xa formed. Data points for A2 subunit were fitted to a single-site ligand binding model as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The stimulation of factor IXa-catalyzed conversion of factor X by A2 subunit was further evaluated as a function of substrate concentration. Initial rates of product formation were determined for factor IXa in the absence or presence of A2 subunit (600 nm). This concentration of A2 reflects 2 times the K d value indicating the majority of enzyme is associated with A2 subunit. Results obtained from this analysis were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and kinetic parameters were determined. As shown in TableI, near saturating levels of A2 subunit had little if any effect on the K m for the factor IXa-catalyzed conversion of factor X. However, thek cat value was increased 75-fold compared with the value obtained in the absence of A2. Based upon 70% saturation of factor IXa with A2, as determined from a quadratic equation for these reactant concentrations and a K d of 300 nm, we estimate the factor IXa-A2 complex would yield ak cat ∼100-fold greater than that of factor IXa alone. Limitations in the quantity of A2 subunit precluded use of higher concentrations in the experiments. Independence of the rate of product formation relative to substrate concentration is illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows the ratio of activation rate in the presence of A2/rate in the absence of A2 as a function of factor X concentration. This ratio was similar over a 20-fold concentration range of factor X and represented a ∼50–70-fold increase in rate in the presence of A2 subunit. This result indicates that the stimulatory role of A2 did not result from contribution to binding substrate but rather occurred from a direct effect of the factor VIIIa subunit on modulating the active site of the enzyme.Table IKinetic parameters for factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor XSampleaReactions were run in buffer A containing 10 μm PS·PC·PE vesicles as described under “Materials and Methods.” Reactions run in the absence of other additions contained 20 nm factor IXa.

Values represent the average of at least two separate experiments. Open table in a new tab Comparison of the kinetic parameters obtained for factor IXa in the presence of an excess of factor VIIIa showed that thek cat obtained with intact cofactor was 200-fold greater than that observed with a near saturating level of A2 subunit (Table I). Furthermore, the presence of factor VIIIa resulted in a severalfold reduction in K m, consistent with the observation of others (31Rawala-Sheikh R. Ahmad S.S. Ashby B. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2606-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Gilbert G.E. Arena A.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10768-10776Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Overall, the catalytic efficiency in the presence of A2 subunit, although ∼100-fold greater than that in its absence, represents <1% the value obtained with factor VIIIa. The rate enhancement observed with A2 did not reflect contamination with low levels of factor VIIIa. The subunits used in these studies possessed no activity when assayed at low dilution in a one-stage clotting assay. In addition, the level of enhancement observed with the A2 subunit was saturable with a maximal value that was 2 orders of magnitude less than rate enhancement observed using factor VIIIa (TableI). Further evidence that the enhancement of factor Xa generation was A2-dependent and not the result of contaminating factor VIIIa and/or subunits was obtained following analysis of A2 expressed as an isolated domain in CHO cells. This A2 form, designated A2CHO, was purified as described under “Materials and Methods” to >95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Similar to the A2 subunit derived from factor VIIIa, the A2CHOenhanced the factor IXa-dependent conversion of factor X in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Data points were fitted to a single-site ligand binding model. The derived value forK d (1.46 ± 0.53 μm) indicated a severalfold weaker affinity for A2CHO compared with A2 subunit derived from factor VIIIa. Furthermore, the maximal rate enhancement for this form of A2 was approximately 30% that observed for the factor VIIIa-derived material. These disparities may be attributed to the apparent instability of the A2CHO form. We observed that ∼50% of the factor IXa-enhancing activity of A2CHO was lost following 48 h at 4 °C compared with no significant loss of activity of the factor VIIIa-derived material under the same conditions. In fact, the latter was stable for over 2 weeks under these conditions. For this reason, the results presented above were obtained within 24 h of purification of the A2CHO. Similar to the -fold stimulation observed with the two A2 forms in the factor IXa-dependent conversion of factor X, factor VIIIa reconstitution using either A2 form (40 nm) plus the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (20 nm) revealed the factor VIIIa-derived A2 yielded ∼4-fold more factor VIIIa activity than the A2CHO (110 versus 25 units/ml, respectively). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of reduced and non-reduced samples indicated that the instability of A2CHOdid not result from proteolysis or dimerization of the A2 by formation of a disulfide bond between free Cys residues in the subunit (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that factor IXa-catalyzed conversion of factor X to factor Xa is enhanced by the presence of the isolated A2 subunit, and the extent of this enhancement appears dependent upon the intrinsic stability (conformation) of the A2. To determine whether isolated A2 subunit interacted similarly with the Fl-FFR-factor IXa, this active site-modified factor IXa was used as a competitor of native factor IXa (fixed at 5 nm) in the factor Xa generation assay. Titration with Fl-FFR-factor IXa resulted in the dose-dependent inhibition of the A2-dependent enhancement effect (results not shown). Fifty percent inhibition of factor Xa generation was obtained at ∼6 nm Fl-FFR-factor IXa, indicating that A2 interacted similarly with the native and active site-modified enzymes. Earlier, we showed that the anisotropy value for Fl-FFR-factor IXa in the presence of factor VIIIa could be achieved following addition of the A2 subunit to a mixture consisting of A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer plus Fl-FFR-factor IXa, suggesting that A2 altered the factor IXa active site in the presence of the complementary factor VIIIa subunits (22Regan L.M.

This active site modulating activity of A2 was further investigated following analysis of the isolated subunit on the fluorescence anisotropy of Fl-FFR-factor IXa. For these experiments, Fl-FFR-factor IXa (30 nm) in the presence of PS·PC·PE vesicles (50 μm) was reacted with 600 nm A2 subunit, and fluorescence measurements were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” This concentration of A2 subunit was calculated to yield nearly 70% saturation of the labeled factor IXa. The presence of A2 subunit resulted in a modest increase in the fluorescence anisotropy of Fl-FFR-factor IXa (Δr = 0.015), suggesting that A2 subunit alters the orientation of the factor IXa active site (TableII). When Fl-FFR-factor IXa was reacted with substrate factor X (300 nm), we observed an increase in anisotropy likely reflecting constraints on the rotational motion of the fluorophore in the enzyme-substrate complex. This factor X-dependent effect on Fl-FFR-factor IXa was markedly increased in the presence of A2 subunit (Δr = 0.057), suggesting that this factor VIIIa subunit made a significant contribution to the orientation of the active site of the enzyme relative to the substrate.Table IIFluorescence anisotropy of Fl-FFR-factor IXaSampleaReactions were performed as described under “Materials and Methods” and contained Fl-FFR-FIXa (30 nm), PS·PC·PE (50 μm) and A2 subunit (600 nm) and factor X (300 nm) where indicated.AnisotropybValues represent the mean ± S.D. for the number of determinations indicated in parentheses.Fl-FFR-FIXa0.193 ± 0.002 (3) + factor X0.237 ± 0.011 (3)Fl-FFR-FIXa + A2 subunit0.208 ± 0.005 (6) + factor X0.294 ± 0.010 (6)a Reactions were performed as described under “Materials and Methods” and contained Fl-FFR-FIXa (30 nm), PS·PC·PE (50 μm) and A2 subunit (600 nm) and factor X (300 nm) where indicated.b Values represent the mean ± S.D. for the number of determinatio"

Due to its sequence similarities with the von Willebrand factor, it has been suggested to dimerize in the endoplasmic reticulum and polymerize in the trans-Golgi network. Using an O-glycosylation-sensitive MUC2 antiserum, a dimerization has been shown to occur in the endoplasmic reticulum of LS 174T cells (Asker, N., Axelsson, M. A. B., Olofsson, S.-O., and Hansson, G. C. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 18857–18863). Using an antiserum immunoprecipitating O-glycosylated MUC2 mucin, monomers and dimers were shown to occur in soluble form in the lysate of LS 174T cells. The amount of O-glycosylated dimer was small, and no larger species were found even after long chase periods. However, most of the labeled MUC2 mucin was found in pelleted debris of the cell lysate. This insoluble MUC2 mucin was recovered by immunoprecipitation after reduction of disulfide bonds. Analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed two bands, of which the smaller migrated as the O-glycosylated monomer and the larger migrated as the O-glycosylated dimer of the cell lysis supernatant. Mucins insoluble in 6 m guanidinium chloride could also be obtained from LS 174T cells. Such mucins have earlier been found in the small intestine (Carlstedt, I., Herrmann, A., Karlsson, H., Sheehan, J., Fransson, L.-Å., and Hansson, G. C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem.268, 18771–18781). Reduction of the mucins followed by purification by isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation and analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed two bands reacting with an anti-MUC2 tandem repeat antibody after deglycosylation. These bands migrated identically to the bands shown by metabolic labeling, and they could also be separated by rate zonal ultracentrifugation. These results suggest that the MUC2 mucin is forming nonreducible intermolecular bonds early in biosynthesis, but after initial O-glycosylation. The MUC2 mucin is the major gel-forming mucin in the small and large intestine. Due to its sequence similarities with the von Willebrand factor, it has been suggested to dimerize in the endoplasmic reticulum and polymerize in the trans-Golgi network.

The mucosal surfaces comprise a 1000-fold larger interface between the external and internal milieu than the skin. At the same time, the chemical and microbiological challenges are more demanding. The most important protective component of the mucosal surfaces is the mucus layer, the gel properties of which are due to macromolecules called mucins. A majority of the mucins known today belong to this classical gel-forming type, although a few glycoproteins defined as mucins are membrane-bound with yet unknown physiological functions (1Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 604-634Crossref Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The present definition of mucin includes all glycoproteins that consist of more than 50% O-linked oligosaccharides and that have a majority of these oligosaccharides localized to mucin domains. These domains have a high number of O-glycosylated Ser and Thr amino acids, often appearing in tandem repeat sequences. Gel-forming mucins are probably altered in several diseases. Thus, alterations in the mucus barrier are probably essential in the pathogenesis of, for example, infections, peptic ulcers, and inflammatory bowel disease. Diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis, and also trivial infections, are characterized by increased mucus viscosity. Despite its medical interest, the biochemical nature of these altered mucin properties is still poorly understood, largely due to the difficulties associated with the large size of these molecules. The gel-forming mucins are proposed to be disulfide bond-stabilized linear polymers of highly glycosylated proteins (2Carlstedt I. Sheehan J.K. Corfield A.P. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1985; 20: 40-76Google Scholar), although other models are discussed (3Forstner J.F. Forstner G.G. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1255-1283Google Scholar). A typical example of such a mucin is encoded by the MUC2 gene, one of the few mucin genes fully sequenced (4Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MUC2 mucin occurs in small and large intestine (5Chang S.K. Dohrman AF Basbaum C.B. Ho S.B.

Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Nadel J.A. Prince A. Basbaum C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The primary translation product, the mucin apoprotein, has a size of about 600 kDa, including N-glycans. It is composed of five major regions; three of these, one N-terminal, one C-terminal, and one central, are rich in Cys, whereas the two others are rich in Thr, Ser, and Pro. The two latter regions are the mucin domains, also called tandem repeat domains, and they become heavilyO-glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus, thus obtaining extreme proteolytic resistance. The Cys rich N- and C-terminal regions show large similarities in the Cys positions to the corresponding parts of the von Willebrand factor (4Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Rothe E.M. Lagace R.E. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21375-21383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is known to form dimers stabilized by C-terminal disulfide bonds (9Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dimerization of the von Willebrand factor takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas a further N-terminal oligomerization occurs in the late Golgi compartments because it requires low pH (9Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the sequence similarities, a similar assembly procedure has been proposed for the MUC2 mucin. Using an antiserum (α-MUC2TR) directed against protein epitopes in the MUC2 tandem repeat, and thus only immunoprecipitating non-O-glycosylated MUC2 mucin species, we have previously shown that non-O-glycosylated MUC2 dimers are formed in LS 174T cells (10Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because O-glycosylation starts in thecis-Golgi or earlier, this indicates an endoplasmic reticulum-based dimerization in analogy with the von Willebrand factor. This assumption has now been verified by subcellular fractionation (11Asker N. Axelsson M.A.B. Olofsson S.-O. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18857-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). By the help of an antiserum directed against protein epitopes unaffected by O-glycosylation, the monomer and dimer were identified in O-glycosylated form. However, the amount of especially O-glycosylated dimers was small, suggesting that these disappeared somewhere. The dimers were found to form insoluble MUC2 mucin occurring in cell debris pelleted from cell lysate. The oligomeric stage of this insoluble MUC2 mucin could not be analyzed, as reduction was necessary for solubilization. When analyzing the reduced insoluble MUC2 mucin, not only the monomeric forms expected from the von Willebrand factor analogy were found. Up to half the amount of monomers were linked together with nonreducible bonds and migrated asO-glycosylated dimers on agarose gels. Mucins insoluble in chaotropic solutions, such as 6 mguanidinium chloride, have earlier been reported in the small intestine (12Karlsson H. Sundler F. Fransson L.-Å. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1982; 144: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 13Carlstedt I. Herrmann A. Karlsson H. Sheehan J. Fransson L.-Å. Hansson G.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14430-14437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that the cell line LS 174T can also form mucins insoluble in 6m guanidinium chloride. These were found to contain the MUC2 mucin with nonreducible bonds, migrating similarly to the metabolically labeled insoluble MUC2 mucin from cell debris pellets. The polyclonal sera α-MUC2TR and α-MUC2N3 have been described (10Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem.

An antiserum called α-MUC2C2 was raised in a rabbit against a synthetic peptide, CIIKRPDNQHVILKPGDFK, based on amino acids 4995–5013 on the C terminus of the human MUC2 apoprotein (4Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A New Zealand White rabbit was immunized once with 500 μg of peptide conjugated via Cys to 400 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin in Freund's complete adjuvant, and twice with 250 μg of peptide conjugated to 200 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The interval between the immunizations was 2 weeks. The specificity of the α-MUC2C2 antiserum was tested as described for the α-MUC2N3 antiserum (11Asker N. Axelsson M.A.B. Olofsson S.-O. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18857-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) using 1 mg of immunizing peptide/25 μl of antiserum for inhibiting immunoprecipitation. The colon adenocarcinoma cell line LS 174T (ATCC CL 188), producing MUC2 mucin, was cultivated as described before (10Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Newly confluent LS 174T cells were starved for 1 h in 2 ml of methionine-free minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmglutamine per 27-cm2 Petri dish and metabolically labeled using 150 μCi of [35S]methionine (Redivue Promix [35S] Cell Labeling Mix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per Petri dish. Brefeldin A (Epicentre Technologies), 10 μg (solubilized in 5 μl of ethanol) per ml of medium, was added 15 min before metabolic labeling. Ammonium chloride (25 mm) was added at the start of starvation. In pulse-chase experiments, the cells were chased with culture medium, and when chase time exceeded 1 day, the medium was replaced daily. The cells were washed twice in cold PBS 1The abbreviation used is: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 10.1 mmNa2HPO4) before lysis on ice by the help of a cell scraper in 1 ml (per Petri dish) of PBS with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 20 μg/ml aprotinin (Trasylol, Bayer), 60 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 3.8 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.02% sodium azide. The lysate was sonicated three times for 2 s each (intensity 15, MSE Soniprep 100) and clarified by centrifugation. The cell debris pellet thus obtained was washed several times in PBS, and its mucin content was solubilized by reduction in 200 μl of PBS, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm dithiothreitol (Merck) for 1 h at 37 °C under agitation. Material not solubilized by the reduction was pelleted by centrifugation and discarded, and the supernatant was incubated with 150 mmiodoacetamide (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature under agitation in the dark, and then diluted with PBS to 1 ml. This solution and the clarified cell lysate were then handled in similar ways. They were incubated with 25 μl of preimmune rabbit serum for 30 min followed by 30 min with 300 μl of 10% (v/v) immunoprecipitin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After pelleting the immunoprecipitin by centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated under agitation for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of α-MUC2N3, 50 μl of α-MUC2C2, or 25 μl of α-MUC2TR. 300 μl of immunoprecipitin was then added before further incubation for 30 min. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation and washed four times in washing solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS). The samples were released from the immunoprecipitin for 5 min at 95 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 5% SDS and, if reducing conditions denoted, also 5% β-mercaptoethanol and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The immunoprecipitin was pelleted, and bromphenol blue (0.015%) was added to the supernatant prior to electrophoresis. Agarose gel electrophoresis (1.5 mm thick) was run on a vertical gel apparatus (140 × 160-mm gels, Hoefer) casted on agarose gel support medium (Gel Bond Film, FMC). The separation gel was 1% Ultrapure (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% Sea Plaque low gelling temperature (FMC) or 2% Ultrapure (Life Technologies, Inc.). The buffer contained 0.378 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and 0.1% SDS. The stacking gel was made of 0.8% agarose (SeaKem Gold, FMC) in 0.126m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1% SDS. The electrode buffer at the cathode was 0.05 m Tris, 0.384 m glycine, and 0.1% SDS, and at the anode 0.025 m Tris, 0.192m glycine, and 0.05% SDS. The current for electrophoresis was about 10 mA. Gels were fixed for 3 h in 30% ethanol and 10% acetic acid, soaked in Amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 5% glycerol for 30 min, dried on slab gel dryer for 2 h at 50 °C, and exposed at −80 °C to a Biomax MS film (Kodak). LS 174T cells were cultured in roller bottles for 10 days with daily medium changes and washed twice in cold PBS. The purification was performed as described before (13Carlstedt I. Herrmann A. Karlsson H. Sheehan J. Fransson L.-Å. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18771-18781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, the attached cells were extracted with guanidinium chloride (6m guanidinium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.5, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (loose pestle), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature under agitation. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation for 25 min at 40,000 × g, and the pellet was washed and centrifuged six times in similar guanidinium chloride buffer. The pellets were brought into solution by reduction of disulfide bonds in reduction guanidinium chloride (6 m guanidinium chloride, 100 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mmfreshly added dithiothreitol, pH 8.0) for 5 h at 37 °C under gentle agitation. Cysteine groups were alkylated by the addition of 150 mm iodoacetamide (powder) followed by incubation overnight at room temperature under agitation in the dark. The mucins were then purified by three rounds of isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation (15Carlstedt I. Lindgren H. Sheehan J.K. Ulmsten U. Wingerup L. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), two with 4 m guanidinium chloride and one with 0.2 m guanidinium chloride. After unloading the gradient into fractions, the mucin peaks were identified by periodic acid-Schiff slot blot, dialyzed against water, lyophilized, redissolved, and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, and 5% SDS. After electrophoresis performed as above (without Gel Bond Film and without stacking gel), the proteins were electrophoretically transferred (1 mA/cm2for 3 h at +4 °C, Sartoblot II-S) to a nylon blotting membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) using 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.0375% SDS, and 10% methanol (pH 8.3) as transfer buffer. The membrane was washed several times in water after blotting and dried before deglycosylation with gaseous hydrogen fluoride at room temperature overnight (16Axelsson M.A.B. Hansson E.M. Sikut R. Hansson G.C. Glycoconj. J.,. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was then blocked in saturated casein (Sigma) in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and stained with 1% α-MUC2TR antiserum for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (DAKO) diluted 1:1000. Both antibody incubations were in 10% of saturated casein in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01% Tween 20. The assay was developed by the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturers recommendations and using Biomax MS film (Kodak). MUC2 mucin insoluble in 6m guanidinium chloride was purified as described above, lyophilized, and redissolved in water (2 μg/μl). 20 μl of this solution was layered on top of a linear 22–43% (w/w) sucrose gradient in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.02% NaN3, with a volume of 5 ml in a 13 × 51-mm ultracentrifuge tube (Beckman). The ultracentrifugation was performed in a Beckman swinging bucket rotor (SW55Ti) for 15 h at 40,000 rpm at +5 °C. Fractions (200 μl) were recovered from the top, and the water was evaporated in a vacuum centrifuge (Heto, Allerød, Denmark). The material was dissolved and boiled in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 5% SDS and subjected to SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, hydrogen fluoride treatment, and assay as described above. The intensity of the bands obtained on the film was measured by video densitometry using a video camera from KAPPA Messtechnik (Gleichen, Germany) and software from Bildanalys (Stockholm, Sweden). Subcellular fractionation was performed as described elsewhere (11Asker N. Axelsson M.A.B. Olofsson S.-O. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18857-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). An alternative homogenization technique was also used. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold 130 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors (11Asker N. Axelsson M.A.B. Olofsson S.-O. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18857-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and homogenized by passing through syringe needles (5 × 22 G/0.7 mm, 5 × 25 G/0.5 mm, 3 × 27 G/0.4 mm). We have previously shown that the α-MUC2TR antiserum precipitates only non-O-glycosylated MUC2 species (10Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas the α-MUC2N3 antiserum also precipitates species migrating slower on SDS-agarose gels. These were regarded asO-glycosylated also because they occurred in the Golgi apparatus but not in the endoplasmic reticulum, of LS 174T cells (11Asker N. Axelsson M.A.B. Olofsson S.-O. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18857-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In order to further relate these different bands on SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis to each other, partially O-glycosylated MUC2 molecules, with intermediate sizes between non-O-glycosylated and O-glycosylated species, were obtained by Brefeldin A treatment of the LS174T cells and analyzed by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis. An additional antiserum, supposed to immunoprecipitate both non-O-glycosylated andO-glycosylated MUC2, called α-MUC2C2, was also used to further verify that the different bands were indeed the MUC2 mucin. Lysates from metabolically labeled LS174T cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the three different antisera mentioned, and the precipitates were analyzed by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 1). Radioactive labeling for 20 min (Fig. 1 A) revealed noO-glycosylated species, but the non-O-glycosylated monomer (M) was found by theO-glycosylation-sensitive antiserum directed against a MUC2 tandem repeat peptide (α-MUC2TR) (10Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and by the α-MUC2N3 and the α-MUC2C2 antisera. The α-MUC2TR antiserum, reacting strongly compared with the two other sera, revealed that some non-O-glycosylated dimers (Fig. 1, D), also, had been assembled. When the cells were cultured for 3 h after radioactive labeling (Fig. 1 C), O-glycosylated monomers (O-M) and dimers (O-D) were found by both the α-MUC2N3 and the α-MUC2C2 antisera. TheO-glycosylation-sensitive α- MUC2TR antiserum, however, did not precipitate these species, but only the remaining non-O-glycosylated monomer and dimer. TheO-glycosylated monomer migrated to a position slightly above the non-O-glycosylated dimer on the gel, whereas theO-glycosylated dimer migrated only a short distance from the stacking gel-separation gel interface. No larger bands specifically reacting with the α-MUC2N3 and α-MUC2C2 antisera could be found in the separation or stacking gels. Cells were also labeled for 30 min in the presence of Brefeldin A (Fig. 1 B). This drug blocks the traffic of vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus but not the traffic in the opposite direction, resulting in a transport of Golgi stack enzymes into the endoplasmic reticulum (17Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1991; 67: 449-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). As a result of this, glycosyltransferases from the proximal parts of the Golgi occur in the endoplasmic reticulum O-glycosylating proteins prematurely. Such O-glycosylation, however, is incomplete, giving smaller sized mucins than the nativeO-glycosylated molecule. Monomers (Fig. 1, o-M) and dimers (o-D) glycosylated in this way were precipitated by all of the antisera. This included the α-MUC2TR antiserum, reacting with a sequence repeated about 100 times in MUC2, whereas the Brefeldin A treatment probably gave a glycosylation of only some of the tandem repeats, allowing the antiserum to react with remaining non-O-glycosylated repeats. The partiallyO-glycosylated bands (Fig. 1, o-M ando-D), but not the non-O-glycosylated mono- and dimer bands (M and D), reacted with theHelix pomatia lectin (not shown). The monomers and dimers observed after Brefeldin A treatment migrated to a position between the non-O-glycosylated and the native O-glycosylated species. This shows that O-glycans decrease the electrophoretic mobility of the MUC2 mucin on SDS-agarose electrophoresis dependent on the amount of glycosylation and that migration on agarose gels could be used for interpreting the glycosylation status of mucins. No MUC2 species larger than O-glycosylated dimer were observed on the agarose gels irrespective of the labeling and chase times used. To find out where the predicted larger forms of MUC2 were lost, the cell debris pelleted from the metabolically labeled cells, lysed with detergent and ultrasonicated, was reduced by dithiothreitol. The obtained solubilized material was immunoprecipitated with the α-MUC2N3 antiserum, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 C). Two major MUC2 bands were found, of which the larger showed a partial separation into two. As a comparison, nonreduced MUC2 immunoprecipitated in the normal way from the clarified cell lysate is shown (Fig. 2 B). This containsO-glycosylated monomer (O-M) andO-glycosylated dimer (O-D). A corresponding reduced lane was also included to demonstrate that the dimer (O-D) is reducible disappearing upon thiol reduction (Fig. 2 A). The monomer (O-M) and dimer (O-D) correspond in size to the two main bands of the reduced insoluble portion. It seems therefore reasonable to believe that the upper band from the insoluble portion (Fig. 2 C, O-X) consists of two monomers held together with bonds that are nonreducible by mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol. This nonreducible material (O-X) is different from the in vivo-occurring reducible dimer (O-D) and will therefore be referred to as X-dimer in this paper. Bands migrating to the same positions as monomer and X-dimer could also be precipitated from the debris pellets by the α-MUC2C2 antiserum or by the H. pomatia lectin (not shown). No material at all in the reduced debris pellets could be precipitated using the α-MUC2TR antiserum (not shown). This shows that non-O-glycosylated MUC2 species are soluble and not incorporated into insoluble material. It should also be noted that no signs of nonreducible bonds have ever been observed in non-O-glycosylated MUC2 species (10Asker N. Baeckström D. Axelsson M.A.B. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21375-21383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultivated LS 174T cells were extracted with 6 m guanidinium chloride, and the insoluble mucin complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and washed six times. The material was solubilized by dithiothreitol reduction and purified by three rounds of isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation in guanidinium chloride (15Carlstedt I. Lindgren H. Sheehan J.K. Ulmsten U. Wingerup L. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The periodic acid-Schiff slot blot intensity of the fractions from the third preparative ultracentrifugation step, in 0.5 m guanidinium chloride, is shown in Fig. 2 E, having a peak within the density interval between 1.53 and 1.49 g/ml, as expected for mucins (15Carlstedt I. Lindgren H. Sheehan J.K. Ulmsten U. Wingerup L. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The material from these fractions was pooled and analyzed by SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis to compare the electrophoresis pattern to that obtained by immunoprecipitation. The mucins were Western blotted onto nylon membranes and deglycosylated by gaseous hydrogen fluoride before staining with the tandem repeat antiserum α-MUC2TR. Two bands were found, migrating to the same positions on the gel as monomer and X-dimer, respectively (Fig. 2 D). No staining at all was found with α-MUC2TR on a non-deglycosylated control membrane (not shown). Because this antiserum does not bind O-glycosylated MUC2, this finding is further evidence that the species wereO-glycosylated. This procedure also confirms that the bands at monomer and X-dimer position on the gels are indeed the MUC2 mucin, because the deglycosylation exposed the epitopes detected by the α-MUC2TR antiserum. As an alternative molecular size separation method to SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis, not dependent on electrical charge, the monomer and X-dimer were also subjected to rate zonal ultracentrifugation. MUC2 mucin insoluble in 6 mguanidinium chloride solubilized by reduction was layered on top of a sucrose gradient, which, after the centrifugation, was recovered as 25 fractions run on agarose gel and assayed by Western blot (Fig. 3 A).

This study demonstrates the power of mixture-based combinatorial libraries to identify distinctly different ligands for closely related receptors. Synthetic combinatorial libraries have gained widespread acceptance for the rapid identification of new drug leads. Complete combinatorial libraries contain all possible arrangements of building blocks used in their synthesis. Peptides were the first compound class to be used in constructing such libraries (1Houghten R.A. Pinilla C. Blondelle S.E. Appel J.R. Dooley C.T. Cuervo J.H. Nature. 1991; 354: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 2Lam K.S. Salmon S.E. Hersh E.M. Hruby V.J. Kazmierski W.M. Knapp R.J.

This laboratory first demonstrated the application of soluble mixture based combinatorial libraries through the identification of the peptide Ac-DVPDYA-NH2 from a library of 52 millionN-acetylated hexapeptides. The sequence corresponds to the antigenic determinant recognized by the antibody 17DO9 (1Houghten R.A. Pinilla C. Blondelle S.E. Appel J.R. Dooley C.T. Cuervo J.H. Nature. 1991; 354: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Concurrently, a second combinatorial library containing 52 million non-acetylated hexapeptides was subsequently used to identify ligands for the opioid receptors, which were closely related to the natural ligands methionine- and leucine-enkephalin (YGGFM, YGGFL) (4Houghten R.A. Dooley C.T. Biomed. Chem. Lett. 1993; 3: 405-412Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In later studies, six distinctly hexapeptide sequences that specifically bound to the μ opioid receptor were identified from the acetylated and nonacetylated libraries (5Dooley C.T. Kaplan R.A. Chung N.N. Schiller P.W. Bidlack J.M. Houghten R.A. Pept. Res. 1995; 8: 124-137PubMed Google Scholar). The combinatorial libraries described above are all mixture-based. Many questions have arisen concerning the use of mixture-based libraries. For example, how many different families of compounds for a particular target exist and can they be identified in a given library? What are the chances of missing the most active compound? What other compounds are present or could be identified from the data that are not immediately obvious? Are similar building blocks universally replaceable? Peptides, because of their ease of synthesis, represent the most convenient compound class for use in the study of mixture-based combinatorial libraries. By achieving an appreciation for the behavior of large mixtures through the use of peptide libraries, we believe these same principles can be applied to virtually all other compound classes (i.e. heterocycles and other small molecules). The opioid receptors represent a convenient system to investigate the power of combinatorial libraries to identify distinctly different ligands for related receptors. There are three primary opioid receptors: mu (μ), delta (δ), and kappa (κ). All three receptors have recently been cloned, and they belong to the seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled family of receptors and have approximately 60% amino acid sequence homology. Screening of the same combinatorial library in separate assays selective for each of the three receptors provides not only new ligands for these receptors but yields insights into the ability of combinatorial libraries to discriminate between closely related receptors. A combinatorial library of 6,250,000 tetrapeptides, made using 50 different amino acids, was prepared in the positional scanning format (6Pinilla C. Appel J.R. Blanc P. Houghten R.A.

This information can then be used to synthesize highly active individual compounds. A PS-SCL of tetrapeptide amides used in the current study consists of four separate sublibraries, each having a single defined position (O) and three mixture positions (X) as follows:O 1 XXX-NH2,XO 2 XX-NH2,XXO 3 X-NH2, andXXXO 4-NH2. The defined positions of the mixtures making up each of the four separate sublibraries address a single position in the tetrapeptide. It should be noted that each of the four positional sublibraries are made up of the same 6,250,000 tetrapeptides. Screening the four sets of mixtures in the three separate opiate specific assays yielded information about the most important amino acids of each position in the tetrapeptide and led to the identification of three different series of active individual tetrapeptides selective for the μ, δ, and κ receptors. The PS-SCL used in this study is composed of 6,250,000 tetrapeptides and contains four sublibraries, in which one of the four positions is defined with a single amino acid (O) and the three remaining positions are a mixture of 50 different l-,d-, and unnatural amino acids (X). The tetrapeptides were synthesized using the solid phase simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis approach (8Houghten R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar) on methylbenzhydrylamine polystyrene resin using t-butoxycarbonyl-protected amino acids. Mixture resins (X) were prepared using mixtures oft-butoxycarbonyl-protected amino acids at each coupling step. Each of the amino acids was present in a concentration that yielded close to equimolar coupling of each amino acid. The ratio of the concentrations of the individual amino acids used to yield this approximate equimolar coupling was pre-determined using reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography to compare mixture profiles relative to standard mixtures synthesized using the divide, couple, and recombine method (1Houghten R.A.

Blossinger C.D. Cook P.I. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). Side chain deprotection and cleavage from the resin support were achieved using low hydrogen fluoride (11Tam J.P. Heath W.F. Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6442-6455Crossref Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and high hydrogen fluoride (12Houghten R.A. Bray M.K. DeGraw S.T. Kirby C.J. Int. J. Pept.

The 200 peptide mixtures were individually extracted with water, lyophilized, and resuspended in water at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/t-butyl chemistry on a COMPAS 242 multiple peptide synthesizer (Spyder Instruments, San Diego). The peptides were synthesized on TentaGel resin in polypropylene mesh packets using inclusion volume synthesis. Reagent and wash solutions were removed by centrifugation (13Pokorny V. Mudra P.

Brains were homogenized in 40 ml of Tris-HCl buffer, 50 mm, pH 7.4, 4 °C (buffer A), and centrifuged (Beckman J2-HC, 35,300 × g) for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in fresh buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. Following incubation, the suspensions were centrifuged as before, the resulting pellets resuspended in 100 volumes of Tris buffer, and the suspensions combined. Membrane suspensions were prepared and used on the same day. Protein content of the crude homogenates was determined by the method described by Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Each assay tube contained 0.5 ml of membrane suspension, 3 nm[3H-d-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) and 0.08 mg/ml mixture, and 50 mm Tris-HCl in a final total volume of 0.65 ml. Assay tubes were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Unlabeled DAMGO was used as a competitor to generate a standard curve and determine nonspecific binding. The reaction was terminated by filtration through GF-B filters on a Tomtec harvester (Orange, CT). The filters were subsequently washed with 6 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (buffer B), at 4 °C. Bound radioactivity was counted on a Wallac Beta-plate Liquid Scintillation Counter (Piscataway, NJ). Rat brains were homogenized as described above using 40 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 nm Ac-rfwink-NH2 (16Dooley C.T. Chung N.N. Wilkes B.C.

Homogenates were centrifuged and incubated as above. Each assay tube contained 0.5 ml of membrane suspension 3 nm tritiated [d-Ser2,Leu5,Thr6]enkephalin (DSLET) in a total volume of 0.65 ml. Assay tubes were incubated for 2.5 h at 25 °C. The assay was terminated, filtered, and counted as above. Unlabeled DSLET was used as a competitor to generate a standard curve and determine nonspecific binding. Guinea pig cortices and cerebella were homogenized in 40 ml of buffer A. Homogenates were centrifuged and incubated as above. Each assay tube contained 0.5 ml of membrane suspension, 3 nm tritiated U69,593 in a total volume of 0.65 ml. Assay tubes were incubated for 2.5 h at 25 °C. The assay was terminated, filtered, and counted as above. Unlabeled U50,488 was used as a competitor to generate a standard curve and determine nonspecific binding. The human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line was a generous gift from Dr. David K. Grandy (Vollum Institute for Advanced Biomedical Research, Portland, OR). The R1.G1 mouse thymoma cell line was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and has been shown to express the κ opioid receptor but not the μ or δ receptors (17Lawrence D.M.P. Joseph D.B. Bidlack J.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, buffered with 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and containing 300 μg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol, 60 μm 2-ethanolamine, and 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were cultured in media containing 10 μm retinoic acid for 6 days before harvesting in order to differentiate the cells as described previously (18Yu V.C. Sadée W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 245: 350-355PubMed Google Scholar). Cell membranes were prepared for use in the adenylyl cyclase assays as described previously (19Lawerence D.M.P. Bidlack J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 1678-1683PubMed Google Scholar). After the initial centrifugation at 200 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, the cells were resuspended in sucrose buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 40 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.6). Cells were centrifuged again at 200 × g and then homogenized in sucrose buffer with five strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Membranes were centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, followed by resuspension in sucrose buffer. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Cell membranes at a protein concentration of 1–4 mg/ml were stored at −80 °C until use. Membranes were incubated in a final volume of 100 μl of 40 mm HEPES, containing 15 units of creatine phosphokinase, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 1 mm1,10-o-phenanthroline, 60 μmisobutylmethylxanthine, 50 μm ATP, 50 μmGTP, 3 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. Agonists and antagonists were included at final concentrations as stated in the text. Naloxone, ICI 174,864, and nor-binaltorphimine were used to block μ, δ, and κ opioid receptors, respectively. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 36 μg of membrane protein. After 15 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 μl of cold 30% potassium bicarbonate, and then the membranes were centrifuged at 12,00 × g for 4 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The amount of cyclic AMP present in 100 μl of the supernatant, equivalent to the cyclic AMP produced by 15 μg of membrane protein, was determined by the use of a cyclic AMP kit (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). This procedure, which uses a cyclic AMP-binding protein in a competitive protein binding assay, is based on the method of Tovey et al. (20Tovey K.C. Oldham K.G. Whelan J.A.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1974; 56: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and was used with the following modification. [3H]Cyclic AMP (specific activity 31.4 Ci/mmol), obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, was used instead of the [3H]cyclic AMP included in the assay kit. [3H]Cyclic AMP, 0.9 μCi, was added into 6 ml of H2O, and 100 μl of the diluted [3H]cyclic AMP was added to the assay tubes. The final supernatants were counted in 10 ml of Ecolite (+) scintillation fluid (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Covina, CA). The tetrapeptide PS-SCL was screened in each of the three separate opioid receptor binding assays described above. Each mixture contained 125,000 tetrapeptides (503). The mixtures were initially screened at a fixed concentration (0.08 mg/ml) at this mixture concentration each peptide was present at a concentration of .06 nm. Each of the 200 mixtures (50 for each of the four positions) making up the library was screened for its ability to inhibit binding of the tritiated ligand to brain homogenates. The library was screened again at a 10-fold lower concentration (0.008 mg/ml) (Fig. 1), since too many mixtures inhibited >90% of [3H]DAMGO binding in the initial screening. IC50 values were subsequently calculated for all mixtures that inhibited >90% of radioligand binding from each of the four positions (Fig. 2). The most active mixture from the series in which the first position was defined was YXXX-NH2 (IC50 = 638 nm). This mixture was 3-fold more active than the second most active mixture (l-Nal)XXX-NH2(IC50 = 1946 nm) and 7-fold more active than the third most active mixture FXXX-NH2(IC50 = 4526 nm). There was a 25-fold difference in activity between the most active and least active mixture tested.Figure 2IC50 values of selected mixtures found to be the most active in the initial screeing of the tetrapeptide PS-SCL at the μ receptor. Each panel represents one of the four positional SCLs (i.e. position one SCL isO 1 XXX-NH2).

The most active mixtures found were all defined with d-amino acids. These mixtures exhibited a smaller range between the most and least active than for the first position.X(d-Nve)XX-NH2(IC50 = 690 nm) was the most active mixture found. The second, third, and fourth most active mixtures were within a 2-fold difference in activity:X(d-Nle)XX-NH2(IC50 = 1112 nm), yXXX-NH2 (IC50 = 1378 nm), and rXXX-NH2 (IC50= 1507 nm) (where y indicates d-tyrosine and r indicates d-arginine). IC50 values were calculated for seven mixtures in which the third position was defined (XXOX-NH2). Six of the mixtures exhibited activities below 2,000 nm, and all six contained l-amino acids in the defined position. The three most active mixtures found wereXXFX-NH2 (IC50 = 824 nm), XXGX-NH2(IC50 = 1119 nm), andXXWX-NH2 (IC50 = 1227 nm). IC50 values were calculated for seven mixtures in which the fourth position was defined (XXXO-NH2). The most active mixture found wasXXX(l-Nal)-NH2 (IC50 = 279 nm). The second most active mixture was 3-fold less active (XXXW-NH2; IC50 = 850 nm) than the most active mixture, and the third most active mixture found (XXXF-NH2; IC50 = 1545 nm) was over 5-fold less active than the most active mixture. The amino acids chosen to make 32 (1 × 4 × 4 × 2) individual peptides are listed in TableI. K i values obtained for these peptides in the μ receptor binding assay are given in TableII. All 32 of the peptides were found to have high affinity for the μ receptor (K i values were < 15 nm). Three of the amino acids in the most active peptide Tyr-(d-Nve)Gly(l-Nal)-NH2(K i = 0.4 nm) were the most active amino acids found for their particular position, whereas glycine in the third position was the second most active amino acid found for that position. The four d-amino acids chosen for the second position were found to be replaceable (i.e. peptides which differed only by the amino acid at this position had very similar activities). Whereas all four amino acids chosen in the third position yielded active peptides, those with small amino acid side chains (glycine and alanine) were more active than those with aromatic side chains.l-Naphthylalanine and l-tryptophan were found to be replaceable at the fourth position. The general motif of active peptides identified at the μ receptor was Tyr-(d-amino acid)(l-amino acid with small side chain) (l-aromatic)-NH2. Since all of the peptides synthesized were found to be active, additional μ-selective peptides are likely to be identified from this library. The selectivity ratios (K i of peptide at δ or κ receptor/K i value of peptide at the μ receptor) of the 32 peptides are illustrated in Fig. 3 A. All 32 peptides were found to be μ selective; none of the ratios were less than 1. The most μ-selective peptide found was YrAW-NH2 (Rank 13 in TableII). All peptides with d-arginine at the second position exhibited excellent μ selectivity. These μ-selective peptides were generally more active at the δ receptor than at the κ receptor.Table IAmino acids chosen for synthesis of individual compounds for the μ receptorPosition 1OXXX-NH2TyrPosition 2XOXX-NH2d-Nve,d-Nle, d-Tyr, d-TrpPosition 3XXOX-NH2Phe, Trp, Gly, AlaPosition 4XXXO-NH2l-Nal, TrpNumber of individual tetrapeptides, 1 × 4 × 4 × 2 = 32.

The affinities at the μ receptor of 32 tetrapeptides, representing all possible combinations of the amino acids chosen, are given. Binding conditions are detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Peptides are ranked by activity After an initial screening (0.08 mg/ml) in a δ-selective receptor binding assay using [3H]DSLET as radioligand, the tetrapeptide PS-SCL was screened again at a 10-fold lower concentration (Fig. 1). IC50 values were calculated for those mixtures that inhibited >60% of [3H]DSLET binding for positions 1 and 2 and >70% of [3H]DSLET binding for positions 3 and 4 (Fig. 4). The most active of the 10 mixtures tested at position 1 included YXXX-NH2 (IC50 = 2468 nm), WXXX-NH2 (IC50 = 6250 nm), wXXX-NH2 (IC50= 7906 nm; w indicates d-tryptophan). The most active mixture was approximately 3-fold more active than the second most active mixture. Although the active mixtures identified were similar to those found in the μ receptor assay, they were less active, e.g. the mixture YXXX-NH2 was 4-fold more active in the μ versus the δ receptor assay. Active mixtures with defined amino acids in the second position were also found to be similar to those identified in the μ assay. IC50 values were determined for 11 mixtures. The five most active mixtures found contained d-amino acids:XyXX-NH2 (IC50 = 4990 nm), XfXX-NH2(IC50 = 7830 nm),XwXX-NH2 (IC50 = 8099 nm)X(d-Nve)XX-NH2(IC50 = 9970 nm), andX(d-Nal)XX-NH2(IC50 = 11795 nm). The 10 mixtures tested in which the third position was defined were found to be less active than those of the remaining three positions, and no mixture was found to have an IC50 value lower than 5,000 nm. The four most active mixtures wereXX(aAba)X-NH2 (IC50 = 6474 nm), XXGX-NH2(IC50 = 7115 nm),XX(l-Cha)X-NH2(IC50 = 8462 nm), andXXMX-NH2 (IC50 = 9085 nm). There was very little difference in affinity between the most active mixtures found at the third position; the 10 mixtures had IC50 values between 6,000 and 10,000 nm. IC50 values were calculated for nine mixtures in which the fourth position was defined. Unlike the results found in the μ receptor assay, the two most active amino acids found at the fourth position were positively charged: XXXR-NH2(IC50 = 4529 nm) andXXXK-NH2 (IC50 = 9026 nm). Mixtures ranked third and fourth at this position were aromatics, as was also found in the μ receptor assay [XXXW-NH2 (IC50 = 6966 nm) and XXXF-NH 2 (IC50= 7395 nm)]. The amino acid combinations chosen for the synthesis of 60 individual peptides are listed in TableIII. Peptides that hadK i values below 500 nm in the δ-selective assay are shown in TableIV. Only three of the peptides were found to have activity under 10 nm. The δ selectivity of the peptides is shown in Fig. 3 B. Twelve of the peptides had greater activity in the μ assay than in the δ-selective assay (ratio of less than 1). This is not altogether surprising as many of the mixtures with defined amino acids chosen for the δ peptides were more active in the μ receptor assay. It is also not surprising that the most δ-selective peptide found, Wy(aAba)R-NH2, (Rank 2 in Table III) contained l-arginine in the fourth position, since this amino acid was ranked first in the δ receptor screening and ranked 17 in the μ receptor screening. Many of the peptides tested were virtually inactive at the κ receptor at the highest concentration tested (10,000 nm).

https://openalex.org/W2085814948,"Transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene is induced by glucagon, acting through cAMP and protein kinase A, and this induction is inhibited by insulin. Conflicting reports have suggested that insulin inhibits induction by cAMP by activating the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), but not MAPK, pathway. Insulin activated PI3-kinase phosphorylates lipids that activate protein kinase B (PKB) and Ca2+/diacylglycerol-insensitive forms of protein kinase C (PKC). We have assessed the roles of these pathways in insulin inhibition of cAMP/PKA-induced transcription of PEPCK by using dominant negative and dominant active forms of regulatory enzymes in the Ras/MAPK and PKB pathways and chemical inhibitors of PKC isoforms. Three independently acting inhibitory enzymes of the Ras/MAPK pathway, blocking SOS, Ras, and MAPK, had no effect upon insulin inhibition. However, dominant active Ras prevented induction of PEPCK and also stimulated transcription mediated by Elk, a MAPK target. Insulin did not stimulate Elk-mediated transcription, indicating that insulin did not functionally activate the Ras/MAPK pathway. Inhibitors of PI3-kinase, LY294002 and wortmannin, abolished insulin inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription. However, inhibitors of PKC and mutated forms of PKB, both of which are known downstream targets of PI3-kinase, had no effect upon insulin inhibition. Dominant negative forms of PKB did not interfere with insulin inhibition and a dominant active form of PKB did not prevent induction by PKA. Phorbol ester-mediated inhibition of PEPCK transcription was blocked by bisindole maleimide and by staurosporine, but insulin-mediated inhibition was unaffected. Thus, insulin inhibition of PKA-induced PEPCK expression does not require MAPK activation but does require activation of PI3-kinase, although this signal is not transmitted through the PKB or PKC pathways. Transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene is induced by glucagon, acting through cAMP and protein kinase A, and this induction is inhibited by insulin. Conflicting reports have suggested that insulin inhibits induction by cAMP by activating the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), but not MAPK, pathway. Insulin activated PI3-kinase phosphorylates lipids that activate protein kinase B (PKB) and Ca2+/diacylglycerol-insensitive forms of protein kinase C (PKC). We have assessed the roles of these pathways in insulin inhibition of cAMP/PKA-induced transcription of PEPCK by using dominant negative and dominant active forms of regulatory enzymes in the Ras/MAPK and PKB pathways and chemical inhibitors of PKC isoforms. Three independently acting inhibitory enzymes of the Ras/MAPK pathway, blocking SOS, Ras, and MAPK, had no effect upon insulin inhibition.

Phorbol ester-mediated inhibition of PEPCK transcription was blocked by bisindole maleimide and by staurosporine, but insulin-mediated inhibition was unaffected. Thus, insulin inhibition of PKA-induced PEPCK expression does not require MAPK activation but does require activation of PI3-kinase, although this signal is not transmitted through the PKB or PKC pathways. Insulin stimulates a variety of changes in growth and metabolism in different cell types, ranging from the stimulation of replication, translation, and protein synthesis to the covalent modification of enzymes of intermediary metabolism (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, insulin regulates the transcription of specific genes, whose products catalyze committed reactions in hepatic glucose metabolism (2Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar).

Transcription of the gene encoding glucokinase, which is required for glycolysis, is induced by insulin and inhibited by cAMP. In contrast, transcription of the gene encoding PEPCK, which is required for gluconeogenesis, is induced by cAMP/PKA and inhibited by insulin (4Sasaki K. Cripe T.P. Koch S.R. Andreone T.L.

The binding of insulin to its cell surface receptors activates their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, leading to receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins, known as IRSs, which serve as adapters in intracellular signaling (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRS-1, the predominant and most thoroughly characterized IRS, binds a variety of signaling molecules when specific tyrosines are phosphorylated, including the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), Shc-1, and Grb 2 (1White M.F.

In some cases, activation of a single pathway may suffice for regulation, whereas in others more than one of these pathways may need to be activated for regulation by insulin. For example, activation of both PI3-kinase and MAPK is required for stimulation of general protein synthesis by insulin, whereas only the PI3-kinase pathway needs to be activated for stimulation of growth-related protein synthesis by insulin (14Mendez R. Kollmorgen G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5184-5192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

We previously showed that multiple binding sites for CREB-GAL4 ligated to a minimal PEPCK promoter (5XGT) could mediate induction by cAMP/PKA and that this induction was inhibited, at least in part, by insulin in H4IIe hepatoma cells (19Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14375-14378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We proposed that insulin targeted the CREB·CBP·RNA polymerase II complex to inhibit PEPCK gene transcription. However, we recently reexamined this question with a more sensitive luciferase reporter gene and found that insulin inhibition of 5XGT was cAMP-independent, as it was indistinguishable from insulin inhibition of basal PEPCK gene transcription (20Yeagley D. Agati J.M. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to the CRE, induction of the PEPCK gene by cAMP requires heterologous binding sites located in the (AC) region (−271/−225) (20Yeagley D. Agati J.M. Quinn P.G. J. Biol.

Factors binding to the AC region and CREB, which is targeted by cAMP-activated PKA, form a cAMP response unit (CRU) that mediates both induction by PKA and inhibition by insulin in the presence of the minimal PEPCK promoter (20Yeagley D. Agati J.M. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Blenis and Montminy and colleagues (11Nakajima T. Fukamizu A.

Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) provided evidence that CBP is targeted by insulin to inhibit PEPCK transcription. Their data indicated that activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway by insulin in H4IIe rat hepatoma cells resulted in activation of pp90rskII by MAPK, leading to its binding to CBP and inhibition of cAMP-induced transcription. On the other hand, Gabbay et al. (24Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1890-1897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PD98059, a potent and specific MEK inhibitor, had no effect upon insulin inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription in H4IIe cells. In addition, Sutherland et al. (9Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) provided evidence that inhibition of PI3-kinase activation abrogated insulin regulation of the PEPCK gene. Thus, there is directly conflicting evidence regarding the insulin-stimulated pathway(s) required for inhibition of PEPCK gene transcription. The present study was undertaken to examine the role of potential insulin signaling pathways in the inhibition of PKA-induced PEPCK gene transcription. We expressed dominant negative and dominant active forms of regulatory signaling enzymes in the Ras/MAPK and PKB/Akt pathways and utilized chemical inhibitors of PI3-kinase and protein kinase C isoforms to assess the contribution of these different signaling pathways to insulin inhibition of PEPCK expression. The PEPCK-Luc plasmid is derived from PEPCK-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, containing −600/+69 of the PEPCK promoter (25Magnuson M.A. Quinn P.G. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14917-14920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G4-PEPCK-Luc plasmid contains the entire promoter region (−600/+69) of the PEPCK gene, in which the CRE is replaced by a GAL4 site (26Xing L.P. Quinn P.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1484-1494PubMed Google Scholar). The CREB-GAL4 fusion protein expression vector contains the activation domain of CREB (amino acids 1–277) fused to amino acids 4–147 of the GAL4 DNA binding domain and has been described previously (27Quinn P.G.

The PKA expression vector, RSV-Cα, contains the cDNA for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A under control of the RSV promoter (28Howard P. Day K.H. Kim K.E. Richardson J. Thomas J. Abraham I.

The pRL-SV plasmid is the expression vector for Renilla luciferase, which is used for normalization of the transfection efficiency as assayed by firefly luciferase.

The G4-Elk-1 plasmid contains the GAL4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) fused to the Elk-1 carboxyl-terminal activation domain (307–428) in pcDNA3a with the Neo gene removed and was provided by R. Maurer of Oregon Health Sciences University (32Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurance M.E. Stork P.J. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HA-Akt, HA-Akt-R25C, and HA-Akt(pleckstrin homology (PH)) plasmids were obtained from T. Franke, Montreal Neurological Institute (33Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). HA-Akt is the expression vector for protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). HA-Akt-R25C is the expression vector for the dimerization-defective PKB. HA-Akt(PH) is the expression vector for a mutant PKB which contains only the pleckstrin homology domain. The pSG5-PKB (wild type), pSG5-PKB, K → A, and pSG5-gagPKB plasmids were obtained from P. Coffer (University Hospital, Utrecht) (34Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G.

The pSG5-gagPKB plasmid is the expression vector for constitutively active PKB. H4IIe cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (19Quinn P.G. J. Biol.

Briefly, 1 ml of calcium phosphate precipitate contained 20 μg of luciferase reporter vector + 2 μg pRL-SV and 2 μg RSV-Cα and/or 2–10 μg expression vector, as indicated in the figure legends. An equal volume of cells was added to the calcium precipitate and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were plated in replicate dishes, incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and treated with 20% Me2SO for 3 min. Where indicated the following were added at the concentration indicated for the last 20 h of the experiment: insulin (Lilly), 10 nm; bisindolyl maleimide I, HCl (BIM) (Calbiochem), 10 μm; and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, (PMA) (Sigma), 1 μm. Following incubation for 20 h, cells were harvested with trypsin treatment and lysed with 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega) and stored at −80 °C for at least 15 min. Lysates (100 μl) were obtained by spinning down the lysed cells, and 10 μl of lysate was used for the luciferase assay. A dual injector Monolight 3010 Luminometer was utilized to measure luciferase activity. 50 μl of each Promega reagent were added to the lysate for the assay. Values were normalized for transfection efficiency and the mean was computed for several experiments. Data shown in figures were obtained from independent transfection experiments performed with different preparations of the various plasmids. H4IIe cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, after which they were pretreated with the PI3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin, or LY294002, for 15 min, prior to adding hormones and incubating with hormone + inhibitor for 3 h. Wortmannin (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. LY294002 (Biomole) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm. Insulin (Lilly) was added to a final concentration of 10 nm. 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62890) Google Scholar). At the end of the procedure, the RNA was dissolved and reextracted with phenol:chloroform, ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in water. The amount of PEPCK mRNA in 50 μg of total RNA was quantitated by primer extension analysis, as described previously (36Quinn P.G. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The molecular pathways proposed to mediate glucagon-stimulated and insulin-inhibited PEPCK gene expression are illustrated in Fig. 1, as are the targets of relevant inhibitors. There is general agreement that glucagon stimulates adenylate cyclase and cAMP activates PKA, a portion of which is translocated to the nucleus where it phosphorylates CREB, leading to CBP binding and activation of gene transcription (37Corbin J.D.

A region containing putative binding sites for transcription factors of the AP-1 and C/EBP families, as well as the CREB binding site (CRE), are required to form a functional CRU in the PEPCK promoter (20Yeagley D. Agati J.M. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Roesler W.J. Graham J.G. Kolen R. Klemm D.J. McFie P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3791-3796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This CRU is necessary and sufficient for both induction by PKA and inhibition by insulin of a minimal promoter, whereas CREB alone is not (20Yeagley D. Agati J.M. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, more specificity is required for insulin to inhibit PKA-induced PEPCK gene transcription than is provided by the P-CREB/CBP/RNA polymerase II complex alone (20Yeagley D. Agati J.M. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18743-18750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that Ras/MAPK-mediated activation of pp90rskII and its binding to CBP is the mechanism utilized by insulin to inhibit PEPCK gene transcription (11Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the Ras/MAPK pathway in insulin signaling relevant to inhibition of PEPCK transcription, we determined the effects of expression of dominant negative (dn) and dominant active (da) forms of enzymes involved in transmission and regulation of signals through the Ras/MAPK pathway. In general, dominant negative forms of enzymes interact with the signaling component immediately upstream and prevent further transmission of the signal, whereas dominant active forms of signaling enzymes stimulate all pathway members downstream of that particular enzyme without any requirement for input from receptors or other enzymes upstream. For the experiments shown in Fig. 2, H4IIe cells were cotransfected with PEPCK-Luc and expression vectors for dn-Ras, dn-Raf, da-PAC-1, and da-Ras. Dominant negative Ras interferes with the exchange activity of SOS, preventing exchange of GDP for GTP on endogenous Ras and interfering with downstream signaling (29Cook S. Rubinfield B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 41Feig L. Cooper G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Dominant negative Raf binds to GTP-activated Ras but cannot be activated itself and thus prevents downstream signaling (30Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Dominant active PAC-1 dephosphorylates and inactivates MAPK, preventing it from activating downstream targets (31Ward Y. Gupta S. Jensen P. Wartman M. Davis R. Kelly K. Nature. 1994; 367: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, expression of dn-Ras, dn-Raf, or da-PAC-1 had no affect upon insulin inhibition of PKA-induced PEPCK-Luc. However, all three Ras-pathway inhibitors relieved constitutive restraint of PKA induction through the Ras pathway and enhanced induction. Dominant active Ras (da-Ras) activates downstream components independently of signaling input (42Der C. Finkel T. Cooper G. Cell. 1986; 44: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of H4IIe cells with PEPCK-Luc and da-Ras blocked induction by PKA at least as effectively as treatment with insulin. Thus, activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway at the level of Ras is sufficient to inhibit PKA-induced PEPCK expression but not necessary for insulin inhibition. To determine whether insulin functionally activated the Ras/MAPK pathway affecting gene expression, we employed G4-Elk, a MAPK-activated transcription factor. H4IIe cells were cotransfected with G4-PEPCK-Luc and G4-Elk and tested for induction by insulin and inhibition of this induction by the Ras pathway mutant enzymes (Fig. 3). In G4-Elk, the activation domain of the MAPK-activated transcription factor Elk is fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The G4-PEPCK promoter contains a GAL4 site in place of the CRE. Thus, if insulin activated the Ras/MAPK pathway in H4IIe cells, G4-PEPCK-Luc expression should be induced by insulin in the presence of G4-Elk, and this induction should be inhibited by the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway mutants. As illustrated in Fig. 3, insulin did not activate G4-PEPCK-Luc through the G4-Elk factor. However, da-Ras did potently activate transcription mediated by G4-Elk, and this induction was unaffected by insulin. These results demonstrate that insulin stimulation of H4IIe cells did not significantly activate the Ras/MAPK pathway. Together with the results above, these data strongly argue against any role for activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway in insulin-mediated inhibition of PKA-induced PEPCK gene expression. Next, we examined the effects of two different chemical inhibitors of PI3-kinase, wortmannin and LY294002, on endogenous PEPCK mRNA expression (Fig. 4). Total mRNA was prepared from H4IIe cells after 3 h of hormone treatment, a time at which changes in PEPCK mRNA are near maximal (4Sasaki K. Cripe T.P. Koch S.R. Andreone T.L. Petersen D.D. Beale E.G. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15242-15251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PEPCK mRNA was quantitated by primer extension analysis. H4IIe cells were treated with nothing, cAMP alone or cAMP + insulin, in the absence or presence of Me2SO vehicle, 0.1 mm or 0.5 mmwortmannin, as indicated in Fig. 4 A. Wortmannin completely blocked insulin inhibition of PKA-induced PEPCK mRNA accumulation. We also tested another chemical inhibitor of PI3-kinase, LY294002 (10 μm), in the same manner. As shown in Fig. 4 B, LY294002 also completely blocked insulin inhibition of PKA-induced accumulation of PEPCK mRNA. These results confirm those of Granner and colleagues (9Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and indicate that activation of PI3-kinase by insulin is obligatory for insulin inhibition of PKA-induced PEPCK gene expression. Based on other studies of insulin signaling, the most probable downstream targets of PI3-kinase are 1) protein kinase B, also known as Akt (13Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

We used recently developed mutants of PKB/Akt to determine whether this enzyme plays an obligatory role in the insulin signal that causes inhibition of PKA-induced PEPCK expression. PKB/Akt is activated by the lipid products of PI3-kinase (33Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 44Bos J.L.

A mutant of PKB/Akt that is defective for dimerization, Akt-R25C (dim-def in Fig. 5), cannot be activated in vitro (33Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997;"
https://openalex.org/W2082037077,"Recent studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) damages human keratinocytes in part by inducing oxidative stress and cytokine production. Severe UVB damage to the keratinocyte can also result in apoptosis or programmed cell death. Although the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) is synthesized in response to epidermal cell damage and epidermal cells express PAF receptors, it is not known whether PAF is involved in UVB-induced epidermal cell apoptosis. These studies examined the role of the PAF system in UVB-induced epidermal cell apoptosis using a novel model system created by retroviral-mediated transduction of the PAF receptor-negative human epidermal cell line KB with the human PAF receptor (PAF-R). Expression of the PAF-R in KB cells did not affect base-line growth or apoptosis, yet resulted in a decrease in the lag time between treatment of the cells and the induction of apoptosis following irradiation with 400 J/m2 UVB. This effect was inhibited by pretreatment with the PAF-R antagonists WEB 2086 and A-85783, confirming involvement of the PAF-R in this process. At lower doses (100–200 J/m2) of UVB, only KB cells that expressed the PAF-R became apoptotic. Treatment of PAF-R-expressing KB clones with the metabolically stable PAF-R agonist 1-hexadexyl-2-N-methylcarbamoyl-3-glycerophosphocholine (CPAF) alone did not induce apoptosis but augmented the degree of apoptosis observed if CPAF was used in combination with lower doses (200 J/m2) of UVB irradiation. Interestingly, UVB irradiation was found to stimulate PAF synthesis only in PAF-R-expressing KB cell clones. The antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine, 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-2-thiourea, and vitamin E inhibited both UVB-induced PAF biosynthesis as well as the augmentation of UVB-induced apoptosis in PAF-R-expressing KB clones, suggesting the possibility that UVB stimulates the production of oxidized lipid species with PAF-R agonistic activity in this model system. Thus, these studies indicate that a component of UVB-induced epidermal cell cytotoxicity can be modulated by PAF-R activation through the production of PAF and PAF-like species.

Through the synthesis and release of soluble proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, keratinocytes play an active role in cutaneous inflammation. Among these inflammatory and trophic compounds that can play a role in cutaneous inflammation/keratinocyte function is platelet-activating factor (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PAF) (reviewed in Refs. 1Prescott S.M.

Derived from glycerophosphocholines, PAF is a potent activator of many cell types including platelets, monocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), mast cells, and vascular endothelium. PAF also has trophic effects on diverse cell types (3Roth M. Nauck M. Yousefi S. Tamn M. Blaser K. Perruchoud A.P. Simon H. J. Exp.

Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Consistent with the myriad of responses linked to PAF, activation of the PAF-R stimulates many signal transduction systems, including phospholipases C, A2, and D and mitogen-activated protein kinase. PAF is the best characterized ligand for the PAF-R; yet other natural products can utilize this receptor including oxidized phospholipids derived from low density lipoproteins (9Smiley P.L.

The diversity of ligands recognized by the PAF-R could potentially allow involvement of this system in numerous pathological conditions including oxidative damage and bacterial infection. Recent evidence suggests that PAF and the PAF-R could be involved in keratinocyte biology. Keratinocytes express functional PAF-Rs (15Travers J.B. Huff J.C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Gelfand E.W. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 816-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and synthesize PAF and 1-acyl PAF analogs in response to numerous stimuli including ionophores, growth factors, and ultraviolet radiation (16Travers J.B.

Eye Res. 1995; 14: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PAF is not found in normal skin but has been detected in inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis (18Mallet A.I. Cunningham F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 126: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and urticaria (19Grandel K.E. Farr R.S. Wanderer A.A. Eisentadt T.C. Wassermann S.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 313: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Within the epidermis, keratinocytes are chronically exposed to a powerful oxidant and DNA-damaging agent, UV light. Acute short term UVB (280–320 nm) absorption by keratinocytes results in oxidative stress and DNA damage (20Stewart M.S. Cameron G.S. Pence B.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1086-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). If the damage is moderate, it can be repaired (21Sanchez Y. lledge S.J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, if the damage is extensive, DNA repair processes do not occur, and the keratinocytes undergo programmed cell death or apoptosis (22Cotton J. Spandau D.F. Radiat. Res. 1997; 147: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells have distinct morphological characteristics; in fact, apoptosis was first recognized in cells based on the unusual morphological features of the process (23Arends M.J. Morris R.G. Wyllie A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 593-608PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kerr J.F.R. J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 1972; 90: 419-435Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the epidermis, apoptosis prevents keratinocytes that have extensive UVB-induced DNA damage from undergoing cell division and passing genetic mutations that might have gone unrepaired to any of their progeny cells, substantially lowering the risk of developing cancer. Disregulation of the apoptotic mechanism in skin can lead to erythema multiforme, lichen planus, papillomas, and skin cancer. Several features of apoptosis can be used to help define this process. For example, the condensed chromatin found in apoptotic cells can be identified by staining cells with the fluorochrome 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The induction of apoptosis also activates a very specific proteolytic cascade. The proteases activated are collectively called caspases, and they target important cellular proteins involved in cell proliferation or DNA repair for precise cleavage (25Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar). One of the caspase substrates is the DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). Just as important proteins are targeted for organized dismantling, so is the chromatin. The induction of apoptosis leads to the activation of an endonuclease that cleaves genomic DNA between nucleosomes (26Porter A.G. Ng P. Janicke R.U. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This destruction of the genomic DNA yields the “DNA ladders” that are characteristic of the experimental proof of apoptosis. It is not presently known whether the PAF system participates in UVB-induced apoptosis. However, several lines of evidence suggest that PAF/PAF-R could be involved in UVB-mediated keratinocyte damage. First, ultraviolet radiation has been reported to be a stimulus for PAF biosynthesis in corneal epithelial cells (17Sheng Y. Birkle D.L. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, cytokines and the oxidative stress generated in response to UVB irradiation in epidermal cells can cause PAF production in other cell types. For example, TNF-α treatment stimulates PAF synthesis in monocytes, neutrophils, and endothelial cells (27Camussi G. Bussilino F. Salvidio G. Bagglioni C. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1390-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species have also been reported to induce PAF biosynthesis in endothelial cells and myocytes (28Lewis M.S. Whatley R.E. Cain P. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2045-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 29Alloatti G. Montrucchio G. Camussi G. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 766-771PubMed Google Scholar). Second, PAF has been reported to have synergistic effects in combination with known inducers of apoptosis. In immature T cells PAF has been noted to have no effect on apoptosis when administered alone; yet this lipid mediator augmented apoptosis induced by a calcium ionophore (30Azzouzi B.E. Jurgens P. Benveniste J. Thomas Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment of eosinophils with PAF has been found to increase FAS-induced apoptosis (31Matsumoto H. Schleimer R.P. Saito H. Iikura Y. Bochner B.S. Blood. 1995; 86: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, PAF has also been reported to inhibit apoptosis in B cell lines (32Toledano B.J. Bastien Y. Noya F. Baruchel S. Mazer B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3705-3715PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that modulatory effects of PAF on apoptosis may be cell type- and insult-specific. The objective of these studies was to assess whether PAF-R activation can modulate UVB-induced apoptosis. Using a model system our laboratory has developed by retroviral-mediated gene transduction to express the human PAF-R in the PAF-R-negative human epidermoid cell line KB (33Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), we present evidence indicating that the PAF-R can modulate UVB-induced epidermal cell damage. Routine chemicals, PAF, 1-hexadexyl-2-N-acetyl-3-glycerophosphocholine (CPAF),N-acetyl cysteine, 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-2-thiourea (TMTU), α-tocopherol (vitamin E), DAPI, and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Growth medium and supplements were purchased from Life Technologies, and fetal bovine serum was from Intergen (Purchase, NY). The PAF-R antagonists were kindly provided as follows: WEB-2086 from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ridgefield, CT) and A-85783 from Dr. James Summers (Abbot Pharmaceuticals, Abbott Park, IL). The epithelial cell line KB (34Eagle H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1955; 89: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) was cultured as described previously (15Travers J.B. Huff J.C.

Clay K.L. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 88-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). KB cells were transduced with the MSCV2.1 retrovirus containing the human leukocyte PAF-R cDNA as described previously (33Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). KB cell clones transduced with PAF-R (KBP) or with control MSCV2.1 retrovirus (KBM) were characterized by Southern and Northern blot analysis and by binding and calcium mobilization studies to demonstrate that the KB PAF-R was functional (33Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Four KBP and two KBM control clones were used in these studies. The four KBP clones all had similar amounts of apoptosis in response to 400 J/m2 UVB at 6 h. All experiments were replicated with at least two different KBP or KBM clones. Epidermal cells were irradiated as described previously (22Cotton J. Spandau D.F. Radiat. Res. 1997; 147: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, KBP or KBM clones were plated on 35-mm dishes 24 h prior to each experiment at 120,000 cells/dish. The cells were rinsed with PBS, and prewarmed (37 °C) medium was added, then UVB-irradiated (FS20 Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, PA), and immediately returned to the 37 °C incubator until processing at various times. In experiments in which CPAF was used, cells were treated with CPAF or ethanol vehicle (0.1%) immediately following irradiation. For experiments involving PAF antagonists or antioxidants, cells were preincubated with drug, ethanol, or Me2SO vehicle (0.5%) for 30 min, and medium was replaced with prewarmed medium before UVB treatment. At the appropriate time point after irradiation, KB cells that had detached from the culture dish and the remaining attached KB cells were combined and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. The cells were then resuspended in 200 ml of PBS and placed into a Shandon (Pittsburgh, PA) cytospin with 50 μl of 22% bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation (5 min at 600 rpm) the cells were fixed with 100 μl of Histochoice fixative (Solon, OH) for 10 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, and 100 μl of 5 μm DAPI in PBS was applied. The cells were incubated in the dark for 20 min and washed three times with PBS over a period of 10 min. After coverslips were mounted with Flouromount-G, the cells whose nuclei contained chromatin aggregation and nuclear condensationversus normal-appearing cells were counted in blinded fashion by a second investigator. Data are expressed as the mean percentages of apoptotic cells. Low molecular weight DNA was extracted from KB cells after UBV irradiation at the indicated times using the Stratagene DNA extraction kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 10 μg of total genomic DNA was separated on a 2.0% agarose gel, and the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. The activation of the caspase proteolytic cascade was measured by assaying for the degradation of a substrate of caspase enzymes, PARP. At the indicated times following UVB irradiation, KB cells were harvested in lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol), and protein lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PARP was identified on immunoblots by incubation with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the intact (116 kDa) PARP protein as well as the major proteolytic cleavage fragment (85 kDa) of PARP (C-2–10, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). PARP protein bands were detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Relative amounts of PARP protein were determined by scanning densitometry (ISS-Enprotech, Natick, MA). 1-Hexadecyl-2-acetyl-GPC (PAF) and 1-palmitoyl-2-acetyl-GPC (PAPC) were measured in KB cells by select ion monitoring gas chromatography mass spectrometry with deuterated internal standards with minor modifications from those previously described (16Travers J.B. Harrison K.A. Johnson C.A. Clay K.L. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 88-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-cm dishes with >90% confluent cells were washed three times with HBSS. 1 ml of prewarmed HBSS containing 0.25% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was added to dishes, and the cells were irradiated. Immediately following irradiation, the reaction was quenched with 2 × 2-ml treatments with ice-cold ethanol, and the entire contents of the plates were scraped and placed into tubes containing deuterium-labeled 1-hexadecyl and 1-palmitoylsn-2 acetyl GPC standards (2 ng each). Cells from similarly treated dishes were trypsinized and counted (Coulter) to derive cell numbers. Data are presented as the means ± S.D. Statistical significance is assessed by the Student's ttest, and significance is set at p < 0.05. Because PAF may have both receptor-dependent and -independent effects (secondary to the formation of biologically active metabolites), a model system was developed to study the role of the PAF-R in epidermal cell function. This system utilizes the human epidermal cell line KB, which, unlike normal human keratinocytes, does not express functional PAF-Rs (15Travers J.B. Huff J.C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Gelfand E.W. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 816-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,16Travers J.B. Harrison K.A. Johnson C.A. Clay K.L. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 88-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A PAF-R–positive KB cell line was created by transducing KB cells with the replication-defective MSCV2.1 retrovirus containing the entire human PAF-R cDNA (33Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). By comparing the effects of UVB on both PAF-R-positive (KBP) and -negative (transduced with empty MSCV 2.1 retrovirus; KBM) KB cells, the role of the PAF-R in UVB-induced apoptosis could be readily assessed. In our first studies, KBM and KBP clones were irradiated with 400 J/m2 UVB, and the cells were examined for gross morphological changes 6 h following irradiation. Expression of the PAF-R alone did not affect the morphology of the cells. However, upon exposure to UVB, an increased cytotoxic response was noted in KBP cells in comparison with KBM cells. To assess whether the increased cell death induced by UVB irradiation of KBP cells was because of apoptosis, we examined the cells for the following three hallmarks of apoptosis: nuclear condensation, internucleosomal DNA cleavage, and caspase activation. KBM and KBP cells were irradiated with either 0 or 400 J/m2 UVB, and all of the cells in the culture dish were harvested 6 h later. The cells were then stained with DAPI and examined by fluorescent microscopy. Unirradiated KBM (Fig. 1 A) or KBP (Fig. 1 C) cells demonstrated primarily round, homogeneously stained nuclei, indicating no degradation of nuclear material. A small percentage of the nuclei from KBM cells irradiated with 400 J/m2 UVB (Fig. 1 B) displayed evidence of apoptosis, identified by the smaller, more intensely stained nuclear blebs. In contrast, KBP cells irradiated with 400 J/m2 UVB contained predominately apoptotic nuclei. The induction of apoptosis in these cells was confirmed by extracting genomic DNA from irradiated and unirradiated KBM and KBP cells. Again, KBM and KBP cells were irradiated with 0 or 400 J/m2 UVB, and genomic DNA was extracted at 4 and 8 h post-irradiation. Unirradiated KBM or KBP cells did not exhibit the characteristic DNA ladders found in apoptotic cells (Fig. 2 A). KBM cells irradiated with 400 J/m2 and harvested at 8 h post-irradiation demonstrated faint nucleosome-sized DNA fragments. However, KBP cells (two separate clones are shown in Fig. 2 B) irradiated with 400 J/m2 UVB displayed extensive DNA ladders 8 h after UVB irradiation. The presence of apoptotic cells was confirmed by a third set of experiments that assayed the activation of the caspase proteolytic cascade. KBM and KBP cells were irradiated as described previously, and the activation of caspase enzymes was monitored by the specific cleavage of the PARP protein. A small percentage of caspase-cleaved PARP protein was detected in KBM cells 8 h following UVB irradiation (Fig. 2 B). In KBP cells, all of the detectable PARP protein was cleaved by 8 h after 400 J/m2 of UVB (Fig. 2 B). Together, these three distinct assays for apoptosis demonstrate that the presence of the PAF-R increased the sensitivity of KB cells to undergo UVB-induced apoptosis.Figure 2UVB-induced DNA laddering and PARP cleavage in KBP cells. A, DNA laddering. Total cellular DNA was extracted from a KBM or two KBP clones 0, 4, or 8 h after irradiation with 400 J/m2 UVB. Extracted DNA was separated on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. B, PARP cleavage. Protein was extracted from a KBM or two KBP clones 0, 4, or 8 h after irradiation with 400 J/m2 UVB and separated by gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed using an antibody that binds both cleaved and uncleaved PARP, which were detected as two separate bands. Densitometry was performed to determine the amount of PARP cleavage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our next studies examined the dose and time dependence of UVB-induced apoptosis in KB cells. Fig. 3 Adepicts a dose-response curve for UVB-induced apoptosis (as assessed by DAPI staining) in treated KB cells at 6 h. UVB treatment caused a significant increase in apoptosis in KBP cells compared with KBM cells at each dose of UVB radiation tested. The kinetics of UVB-induced apoptosis in KBM versus KBP cells following irradiation with 400 J/m2 was next examined. As shown in Fig. 3 B, apoptosis was seen in response to UVB irradiation at earlier time points in KBP cells than in KBM cells. In KBP cells treated with 400 J/m2, 50% apoptosis was achieved at less than 4 hversus 8 h in the KBM cells. By 16 h, there was no difference in the amount of apoptosis between KBP and KBM cells (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, the amounts of PARP cleavage and DNA laddering at 24 h after treatment with 400 J/m2 UVB were similar in KBM and KBP clones (data not shown). These experiments suggested that the presence of the PAF-R accelerated the induction of apoptosis in response to a lethal dose of UVB radiation. To confirm that the differences in UVB-induced apoptosis between KBM and KBP cells were because of PAF-R activation, the ability of the competitive PAF-R antagonists A-85783 (35Sheppard G.S. Pireh D. Carrera G. Bures M. Heyman H.R. Steinman D. Davidsen S.K. Phillips J. Guinn D.E. May P.D. Conway R.G. Rhein D.A. Calhoun W.C. Albert D.H. Magoc T.J. Carter W. Summers J.B. J. Med.

Dermatol. 1987; 118: 475-480Google Scholar) to inhibit the accelerated induction of apoptosis seen in PAF-R expressing KB cells was evaluated. Pretreatment of cells with A-85783 (Fig. 4 A) and WEB 2086 (Fig. 4 B) for 30 min prior to irradiation with 400 J/m2 decreased the amount of apoptosis seen in KBP cells at 6 h. As expected, these PAF antagonists had no effect on UVB-induced apoptosis in KBM cells. Although PAF-R antagonists could inhibit the augmentation of UVB-induced apoptosis in KBP cells at 6 h, these compounds had no effect on UVB-induced apoptosis in KBP or KBM cells at 24 h (data not shown). The ability of exogenous PAF to modulate apoptosis in response to a sublethal dose of UVB was next investigated. Because PAF is rapidly degraded by acetylhydrolases found in serum (37Farr R.S. Cox C.P. Wardlow M.L. Jorgensen R. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1980; 15: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the metabolically stable PAF-R agonist CPAF (38Tessner T.G. O'Flaherty J.T. Wykle R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4794-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in these experiments. Treatment of KBM or KBP cells with CPAF alone (1 nm to 1 μm) did not induce apoptosis (data not shown). However, high (2–10 μm) doses of CPAF exerted cytotoxic effects on both KBP and KBM clones, suggesting a PAF-R-independent process (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, a combination of 500 nm CPAF and irradiation with a sublethal (200 J/m2) dose of UVB resulted in a further increase in the amount of apoptosis in KBP cells over UVB irradiation alone. Altogether, these findings indicate that the difference in UVB responsiveness between KBP and KBM clones is because of the presence of the PAF-R. As shown in Fig. 3 B, irradiation of KBM and KBP cells with 400 J/m2 UVB resulted in essentially equal amounts of apoptosis at 16 and 24 h. Further experiments were performed to assess whether sublethal UVB doses at these later time points have a differential effect between KBP and KBM cells. In these experiments, the amount of apoptosis induced by low dose (100 and 200 J/m2) UVB on KBP and KBM cells at 24 h were compared. Treatment of KBP cells with these lower doses of UVB resulted in increased cytotoxicity over similarly treated KBM cells (Fig. 6). In particular, irradiation of KB cells with 100 J/m2 UVB induced apoptosis selectively in KBP cells at 24 h. Our finding that the expression of the PAF-R in an epidermal cell line augmented UVB-induced apoptosis and was inhibited by two structurally dissimilar competitive PAF-R antagonists implied that UVB could induce the biosynthesis of PAF-R agonist(s) in these cells. To test whether this UVB-induced agonistic activity was because of PAF, KBM and KBP clones were treated with UVB (320–2650 J/m2), and PAF (1-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-GPC) and the PAF-R agonist 1-palmitoyl-2-acetyl-GPC were measured by mass spectrometry (16Travers J.B.

Our study has examined their potential links to the cell cycle machinery. We find that constitutively active mutants of Rac and Cdc42, but not Rho, are potent inducers of E2F transcriptional activity in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Furthermore, activated Rac and Cdc42, but again not Rho, are capable of inducing cyclin D1 accumulation and pRB hyperphosphorylation in serum-deprived cells, outlining one route leading to enhanced E2F-mediated transcription. The inhibitory effect of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p16ink4, p21cip1, and p27cip on Rac/Cdc42-mediated E2F transcription corroborates a role for pRB family members and their functional inactivation by cyclin-dependent kinases in generating E2F activity. While the up-regulation of E2F transcriptional activity by Rac or Cdc42, not Rho, suffices for entry into S phase and DNA synthesis in Rat-1 R12 cells, this is clearly not the case in NIH 3T3, where additional requirements must exist.

While the up-regulation of E2F transcriptional activity by Rac or Cdc42, not Rho, suffices for entry into S phase and DNA synthesis in Rat-1 R12 cells, this is clearly not the case in NIH 3T3, where additional requirements must exist. The Rho family of GTPases currently comprises Rho (A, B, C), RhoE, RhoG, RhoL, Rac (1Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar, 2Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), Cdc42Hs, and TC10. Several family members have been demonstrated to serve essential and specialized functions in actin cytoskeleton organization in response to extracellular growth factor signaling. As specific examples, it is known that platelet-derived growth factor induces membrane ruffles and lamellipodia via Rac, bradykinin induces filopodia formation through Cdc42, and lysophosphatidic acid induces stress fibers and focal adhesions mediated by Rho (1Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar, 2Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

The activated form of each of these GTPases elicits the same cytoskeletal rearrangements (1Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar, 2Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3746) Google Scholar). In Swiss 3T3 cells it was demonstrated by microinjection studies that Cdc42, Rac, and Rho cross-talk and may function in a more or less linear, hierarchical cascade: Cdc42 → Rac → Rho, to regulate cytoskeletal rearrangement (4Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3746) Google Scholar). The function of this family of GTPases is, however, not limited to control of actin polymerization. All three members have been shown to play important roles in regulation of cell growth as well. First, they are weak oncogenes on their own. Various rodent fibroblast cell lines expressing constitutively active mutants of Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 display weak focus-forming activity, soft agar growth, and increased saturation density (5Khosravi-Far R.

Biol. 1997; 7: 629-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Second, they have also been demonstrated to play a role in Ras-mediated transformation, since dominant negative mutants of Rho family GTPases inhibit Ras transformation (5Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 6Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Third, activated forms of Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 are capable of inducing DNA synthesis in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells (10Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). In these cells, not only are they sufficient to induce G1 progression into S phase, but they have also been demonstrated to be required for serum-mediated S phase entry, underscoring again their importance in normal growth control (10Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). In addition to a role of Rho family GTPases in regulating actin polymerization and proliferation, substantial evidence indicates that they can also regulate gene expression. Rac, Cdc42, and Rho can, evidently via distinct pathways, induce serum response factor activation leading, in concert with ternary complex factor, to elevated transcription from a serum response element, present, e.g.in the promoter of the immediate early gene c-fos (11Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42, but in most cell types not Rho, also activate the Jun N-terminal kinase and p38/HOG1 kinase, which in turn leads to increased transcriptional activity of c-Jun and ATF-2 (12Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 13Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The accumulating evidence implicating Rho GTPases in multiple aspects of cell proliferation suggests that some of their activities may be linked to the cell cycle. The mammalian cell cycle transition from G1 to S is regulated at least in part through the phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation of a family of proteins termed the “pocket” proteins (reviewed in Weinberg (16Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar)). These include p105RB (the retinoblastoma protein), p107, and p130, which are phosphorylated in a temporal manner by a distinct set of complexes between cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; pRB, retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product; FCS, fetal calf serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; v-H-Ras, viral Harvey Ras; CMV, cytomegalovirus; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. Especially cyclins D, E, and A in specific complexes with Cdk4, Cdk6, and Cdk2 have been implicated in the sequential phosphorylation of RB family members (reviewed in Weinberg (16Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar) and Sherr (17Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4985) Google Scholar)). Regulation of Cdk activity is fairly complex; in addition to the positive regulation through cyclin-association, negative regulation is carried out by a family of Cdk inhibitors. These can be divided into specific inhibitors (e.g. p16ink4) targeting cyclin D/Cdk4(6) complexes, and broad spectrum inhibitors (e.g. p21cip1 and p27kip1) which inhibit all cyclin/Cdk complexes (reviewed in Sherr and Roberts (18Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar)). One important consequence of the phosphorylation of pocket proteins is the concomitant release of transcription factors of the E2F family, the activity of which appears to be essential for subsequent G1/S progression, and which leads to induction of genes associated with DNA replication (19Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). At least in some cell systems, ectopic overexpression of selected members of the E2F family is capable of inducing quiescent cells to enter into DNA synthesis (20Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 21Lukas J. Petersen B.O. Holm K. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 22Shan B. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8166-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). However, relatively little is known about how canonical signal transduction cascades interface with the general cell cycle machinery as outlined above, and the link between Rho family GTPases and the cell cycle has so far remained elusive. This study demonstrates that although activated Rac and Rho induce neither DNA synthesis nor foci in NIH 3T3 clone 7 cells, Rac (and Cdc42) are potent inducers of E2F transcriptional activity in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, while Rho is not. Rac and Cdc42 also converge on the RB pathway, since their activated forms can induce pRB hyperphosphorylation, and their ability to up-regulate E2F-dependent transcription can be inhibited by the specific Cdk inhibitor p16ink4. NIH 3T3 clone 7 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), while the UNC line of NIH 3T3 (23Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by C. Der, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) was grown in DMEM containing 10% donor calf serum and ATCC NIH 3T3 propagated in DMEM with 10% newborn calf serum. R12 cells are a subclone of Rat-1 cells stably expressing the tet-VP16 transactivator (24Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) (kind gift of D. Resnitzky and S. Reed). These cells were routinely cultured in DMEM including 10% FCS. Transfections for reporter assays were generally done by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method according to Chen and Okayama (25Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). One μg of reporter and 2 μg of pEXV, or 0.2 μg of CMV-based, GTPase expression plasmid was used for each 60-mm dish, except when examining the effect of Cdk inhibitors, where 2 μg of pEXV Rho family expression vector was used together with 1 μg of Cdk inhibitor expression vector. The same total amount of DNA was always applied to cells and wherever required, the empty vector pRK5, was used to normalize the DNA dose. All reporter transfections were carried out in duplicate, and a minimum of two independent DNA preparations were compared to ensure reproducibility. For reporter assays, the calcium phosphate precipitate was left for 18–24 h, and after washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.3% FCS (for clone 7) or 0.5% donor calf serum (for UNC) for another 48 h. UNC NIH 3T3 cells were electroporated using a Genepulser II apparatus (Bio-Rad) with 10 μg of expression plasmid in a volume of 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and applying the settings 0.27 kV, 125 μF, and 1000 ohm. R12 cells were brought to quiescence by incubation for 48 h in serum-free DMEM and subsequently microinjected directly into the cell nuclei using a Zeiss AIS microinjection system essentially as described previously and employing 25 μg/ml expression plasmid for each Rho family member or 100 μg/ml pGL3 6xE2F reporter plasmid (26Lukas J.

Cells positively expressing the microinjected DNA were verified either by indirect immunofluorescence of the expressed protein or by co-injecting rabbit IgG (1 mg/ml) as a microinjection marker. When assaying S phase entry, the injected cells were evaluated 30–36 h following the injection. BrdUrd (100 μm) was added for the last 24 h, after which the cells were subjected to double-immunofluorescence analysis visualizing both incorporated BrdUrd as well as expression of the protein encoded by the microinjected plasmid. This double staining, as well as in situ staining for luciferase, was carried out essentially as described previously (26Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids pEXV3 Rac1, pEXV3 Rac1V12, pEXV3 RhoAV14, pRK5 RacL61, pRK5 RacL61 40C, and pRK5 RacL61 37A (kindly provided by A. Hall) all encode Myc -tagged proteins, and the plasmids have been previously described (1Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A.

The plasmids pRK5 and pRK5 Cdc42V12, of which the latter directs expression of a Myc-tagged version of Cdc42V12 from the CMV promoter, were obtained from B. Schaffhausen. The Rho expression vector pCMV5 HA-RhoL63 was generously donated by M. Schwartz. Long terminal repeat expression vectors for RhoL63 and Cdc42V12 (pZIPNeoSV(X)) were provided by C. Der. Oncogenic H-Ras (D12) was expressed from the plasmid pEXV3 RasD12 again in a Myc-tagged form (10Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar); it was kindly provided by H. Paterson. CMV v-ras encoding the H-Ras protein carrying the individually activating G12R and A59T mutations, was constructed as follows. The previously described murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat-driven v-H-Ras expression plasmid pBW1423 (28Willumsen B.M. Papageorge A.G. Kung H.F. Bekesi E. Robins T. Johnsen M. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was digested withBamHI to excise the v-H-ras cDNA, which was cloned into the BamHI site of the pCMVNeoBam expression vector (29Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar), generating CMV v-ras. Plasmids encoding Cdk inhibitors, pXmyc-p16, pCMV HA-p21, and pCMV p27 (kindly provided by R. Bernards), and the loss-of-function mutant, pXmyc-p16 (P114L), have been previously described (21Lukas J. Petersen B.O. Holm K. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The E2F-responsive reporter plasmid pGL3-TATA-6xE2F (referred to as pGL3 6xE2F) contains six E2F sites upstream of a minimal TATA box and a luciferase gene. It was generously donated by A. Fattaey, and has been previously evaluated in terms of E2F responsiveness (26Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified by two consecutive bandings in a CsCl gradient according to standard procedures. No internal standard was used in the transfections, since all promoters we tested (giving measurable activity) responded to Ras or Rac expression to varying extents. We obtained consistent data using several plasmid constructions based on different promoters or different activating mutations, several plasmid preparations of these, and monitored protein concentration for yield in the cell extracts as well as expression of the tagged, exogenous protein by blotting. Monoclonal antibodies to pRB (Q3–245, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), Cyclin D1 (DCS-6 (30Lukas J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Mol. Cell.

Schaffhausen), and Ras protein (146-3E4, Quality Biotech) have been previously described and are commercially obtainable. Luciferase assays were performed essentially according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Briefly cells on 60-mm dishes were incubated with 400 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min, scraped, and transferred into an Eppendorf tube, and after a high speed centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. A total of 20 μl of supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and after a 15-s incubation, the emitted light was measured for a 5-s period on a Berthold Lumat LB 9501 luminometer. For preparation of lysates, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off with a cell scraper, and the cells were collected by low speed centrifugation. The cell pellet was extracted for 15 min on ice with a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris base, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with the phosphatase and protease inhibitors 1.0 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Subsequently extracts were spun in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 5 min, and the supernatant lysates were transferred to an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer (5% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.0625 m Tris, pH 6.8, 0.0075% bromphenol blue, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol), after which the samples were boiled for 3 min. Western blotting was done according to standard procedures. Equal amounts of total protein, as measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad), was loaded in each lane. Approximately 20 μg of total protein were loaded when analyzing the pRB phosphorylation state. The signal on Western blots was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL or ECL plus) reagents according to the manufacturer (Amersham Life Science). LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.)-transfected NIH 3T3 clone 7 cells were incubated with DNA for 5 h, serum was added, and the cells were further incubated for 19 h. Medium was changed to 0.3% FCS, and after 24 h of serum starvation, [H]thymidine (final concentration, 3 μm, 0.29 Ci/mmol) was added; the control received serum to 9%. After 24 h of incubation, cell extracts were made, and reporter activity and incorporated thymidine (measured after trichloroacetic acid precipitation and collection on glass fiber filters) were determined. Since the Rho family of GTPases has been implicated in numerous aspects of cell proliferation, we wanted to examine whether they can directly regulate components of the cell cycle machinery, in particular the E2F family of transcription factors that play a pivotal role in controlling G1 progression into S phase. In order to measure directly the total E2F-dependent transcriptional activity, we chose a previously characterized and evaluated synthetic reporter construct, pGL3 6xE2F, containing six E2F sites immediately upstream of a minimal TATA box and a luciferase reporter gene (kind gift from A. Fattaey, described further in Lukaset al. (26Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar)). This particular reporter construct provides a sensitive and specific probe for quantitatively measuring E2F transcriptional activity in transiently transfected cells. Expression vectors pEXV RacV12, pRK5 RacL61, pRK5 Cdc42V12, pEXV RhoV14, pCMV5 RhoL63, pEXV RasD12, and CMV v-ras encoding constitutively active versions of Rac, Cdc42, Rho, and Ras were cotransfected with reporter by calcium phosphate precipitation into NIH 3T3 (clone 7) murine fibroblasts, and after transfection the cells were subjected to serum starvation for 48 h in DMEM containing 0.3% FCS. Importantly, we found that activated Rac, Cdc42, and Ras potently stimulated transcription from E2F sites, but activated Rho displayed at most marginal induction of E2F activity (Fig. 1). The two sets of expression vectors, driven by either CMV or the SV40 early promoter/enhancer, and encoding two distinct activated variants of each GTPase, all produced a consistent induction of E2F activity for Rac, Cdc42, and Ras, but none for Rho (Fig. 1). In addition, the long terminal repeat expression constructs, pZIPNeoSV(X) Cdc42V12 and pZIPNeoSV(X) RhoL63, gave as expected significant E2F activation for Cdc42 but none for Rho (data not shown). The nonactivated, cellular version of Rac displayed only a very slight activation of E2F-dependent transcription, emphasizing the importance of GTP-loading on Rac in triggering downstream pathways leading to E2F-mediated transcription (Fig. 1). The failure for activated Rho to up-regulate E2F transcription was not because of substantially lower levels of expression, since Western blotting with the monoclonal anti-Myc epitope tag antibody demonstrates that RacV12, Cdc42V12, RhoV14, and RasD12 are expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 1). A dose-response curve for each construct had established the optimal dose of expression vector for reporter assays, and none of the doses of expression construct within a wide range revealed any significant E2F transcriptional activation when Rho was examined. It was observed that especially Cdc42V12 at high dose when expressed from the CMV vector displayed some toxicity, since the fold induction of E2F activity dropped substantially at high dose (data not shown). This is consistent with previous reports that activated, GTPase-defective mutants of Cdc42, when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells can be cytotoxic, and therefore preclude the isolation of stable cell lines, perhaps through the G1 arrest caused by a downstream Cdc42 effector, the p38 kinase (32Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Cur. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 33Molnar A. Theodoras A.M. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13229-13235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A number of controls were performed to further validate the E2F reporter assay outlined in Fig. 1. The corresponding parental construct lacking all six E2F sites showed extremely low activity, but no activation with Rac or Cdc42 (data not shown). In addition, the ability of activated Rac or Cdc42 to promote E2F-mediated transcription was confirmed in two distinct NIH 3T3 cell lines (ATCC and UNC) with only minor differences, reflecting individual degrees of starvability and type of serum used for their cultivation. Furthermore, the method of gene transfer, whether using calcium phosphate co-precipitation, lipofection, or electroporation, did not significantly affect the results, but produced quantitatively similar responses for each GTPase examined. Because activation of E2F-mediated transcription often is a result of dissociation from inhibitory complexes with pocket proteins due to phosphorylation of these by Cdks, we investigated if expression of activated Rho family members in NIH 3T3 cells can influence this phosphorylation event. In order to obtain the maximum signal, we chose a particular line of NIH 3T3 cells (UNC) which can be electroporated to high transfection efficiency. The high frequency of expressors after transient transfection of these cells by electroporation allowed us to directly analyze the phosphorylation status of endogenous pRB protein by electrophoretic mobility shifts on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Subsequent to electroporation, the cells were starved in 0.2% donor calf serum for 24 h, inducing the accumulation of pRB in its hypophosphorylated form, thus highlighting any potential effects on pRB phosphorylation. Clearly, the expression of RacV12, Cdc42V12, or oncogenic Ras induced the appearance of the hyperphosphorylated form of pRB (Fig. 2), which has often been correlated with inactivation of its growth suppressive function. In contrast, RhoV14 displayed at most a slight induction of pRB hyperphosphorylation. Rac in its nonactivated form failed to induce the appearance of hyperphosphorylated pRB, just as in the E2F reporter assays, stressing the importance of GTP loading. Collectively, these data support the finding that Rac, Cdc42, and Ras in their activated form, but not Rho, can promote E2F transcription. Using the same transfection protocol, we also investigated if Rho family members can trigger the accumulation of cyclin D1 protein, which, in complex with Cdk4 or Cdk6, is considered a physiological pRB kinase and to be a key mediator for the release of transcriptionally active E2F in response to several growth factors. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 by immunoblotting with cyclin D1-specific antibody, Rac and Cdc42 when activated, but again not Rho, caused a moderate accumulation of cyclin D1 protein compared with the potent induction observed with v-H-Ras, and the almost undetectable level in serum-deprived NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. The up-regulation of cyclin D1 protein elicited by oncogenic Ras has been reported from several investigators (34Liu J.J. Chao J.R. Jiang M.C. Ng S.Y. Yen J.J. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 35Winston J.T. Coats S.R. Wang Y.Z. Pledger W.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar), and serves as a control to further validate our assay system. Since oncogenic Ras at high expression levels also has been shown to up-regulate p21cip (36Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), we examined whether this was the case for Rho family members. Western blot analysis demonstrated that RacV12 and Cdc42V12, but not RhoV14, both are capable of moderately up-regulating p21cip1 levels, whereas v-Ras is a much stronger inducer (Fig. 2). Since pRB phosphorylation and its concomitant functional inactivation is generally believed to be mediated by Cdks, in particular complexes between D-type cyclins and Cdk4/6, we examined if a specific inhibitor of these complexes, p16ink4 had any effect on the released free E2F activity. The results of reporter assays in NIH 3T3 clone 7 fibroblasts demonstrate that RacV12 activation of E2F-mediated transcription is sensitive to p16ink4, as seen by a substantial reduction in transactivation potential when p16ink4 is coexpressed (Fig. 3). A loss-of-function mutant of p16ink4, P114L, caused only a slight reduction of RacV12 stimulation of E2F activity, demonstrating that the p16ink4abrogating effect is dependent on a functional inhibitor capable of binding Cdk4/6 (Fig. 3). We also tested if the broad spectrum Cdk inhibitors, p27kip1 and p21cip1 could affect Rac-mediated induction of E2F-dependent transcription, and observed that they reduced RacV12-mediated E2F transcription as much as, or for p21cip1 even more than, p16ink4. Western blot analysis of Rac showed no modulation of Rac expression by the inhibitors (Fig. 3). We found similar inhibitory effects of p16ink4, p21cip1, and p27kip1 on Cdc42V12-mediated E2F transcriptional activation as for RacV12 (data not shown). In its ultimate consequence, E2F transcriptional activation may culminate in S phase entry and DNA replication (20Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). We examined this possibility"

The characteristics of the mutated carrier, RFC1-E45K, were studied by cDNA transfection into the murine MTXrA line in which endogenous carrier is not functional. Folic acid influx doubled in the transfectant MTXrA-E45K as compared with L1210 or MTXrA cells; in contrast, MTX and 5-CHO-THF influx was only 14 and 27% that of L1210 cells, respectively. 5-CHO-THF influx in MTXrA-E45K cells was characterized by a 12- and 3.6-fold decrease in influx V max andK t respectively, relative to L1210 cells. The folic acid influx K i in L1210 cells was more than 50-fold greater than that of MTX based upon inhibition of 5-CHO-THF influx. In comparison, the mutated carrier had comparable affinities for folic acid and MTX in MTXrA-E45K cells due to a 7-fold decrease in the folic acid influx K i and 7-fold increase in the MTX influx K i. Transport via native RFC1 is inhibited by a variety of anions in L1210 cells associated with an increase in influx K t. However, influx of 5-CHO-THF in MTXrA-E45K cells in a HEPES buffer (9 mmchloride) was decreased by 70% due to a 3-fold fall in theV max. In the complete absence of chloride (K+-HEPES-sucrose buffer) 5-CHO-THF influx was only 10% that in HBS buffer. 5-CHO-THF influx was restored by addition of chloride, fluoride, or nitrate but not by sulfate, phosphate, or ATP which were all inhibitory over a broad range of concentrations.The data suggest that substitution of a positive for a negative amino acid at position 45 results in the loss of RFC1 mobility in the absence of small inorganic anions that bind to, and neutralize the positive charge on, the lysine residue. Inhibition by higher charged anions may be due to interactions at another carrier site present in both the mutated and wild type carrier. This and other studies suggest that amino acids in the first predicted transmembrane domain play an important role in determining the spectrum of affinities for, and mobility of, RFC1 and is a cluster region for mutations when cells are placed under selective pressure with antifolates that utilize RFC1 as the major route of entry into mammalian cells.

Folates are key elements in mammalian biosynthetic processes, and even subtle folate deficiency has been implicated in developmental defects (1Daly L.E. Kirke P.N. Molloy A. Weir D.G. Scott J.M. J.

Since diffusion of folates into cells is a slow process, particularly at their low levels present in blood under physiological conditions, cells must meet their folate requirement through facilitated or energy-requiring transport processes (5Henderson G.B.

Uptake of MTX is also mediated by RFC1 and impaired MTX transport is a common mechanism of resistance in clinical regimens (8Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Ravindranath Y. Proefke S.A. Wong S.C. Gimotty P.

Of particular value in deciphering these properties are the functional changes that occur when the carrier is mutated under antifolate selective pressure in the presence of a variety of different folate substrates.This laboratory has initiated studies using chemical mutagenesis to define the structural requirements for the transport of folate compounds in murine leukemia cells. In the first report on this work a substitution of asparagine for serine at amino acid 46 in the first predicted transmembrane domain was described in cells that were selected in the presence of MTX with 5-CHO-THF as the sole folate source (16Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This mutation resulted in markedly impaired MTX transport, whereas sufficient transport capacity for 5-CHO-THF was retained to minimally affect the growth requirement for this essential substrate.In the present report a second mutation is characterized in an adjacent amino acid, 45, that occurred in cells subjected to MTX selective pressure with folic acid as the sole folate source. This substitution of a lysine for glutamate resulted in a marked loss of antifolate and reduced folate transport but enhanced carrier-mediated transport of folic acid. This mutation also resulted in a qualitative change in the effects of anions on the carrier-mediated transport of folates, producing an altered carrier that absolutely requires, rather than is only inhibited by, the presence of extracellular inorganic anions for folate entry into cells. These observations, along with additional work from this (16Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and other laboratories (17Tse A. Brigle K.E. Moran R.G. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 162Google Scholar), indicate that the first putative transmembrane domain is an important site of interactions between RFC1 and folates that affects substrate binding and translocation and is a critical region for the development of mutations, in the presence of antifolate selective pressure, that produce highly diverse functional consequences.DISCUSSIONThis laboratory has initiated studies that characterize the relationship between structure and function of the murine RFC1 using chemical mutagens to generate a broad spectrum of mutations within the carrier (16Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A variety of selective pressures has been applied to simulate specific conditions that occur in vivo and in vitro in order to generate a diversity of functional changes that optimize identification of the regions of RFC1 that are key determinants of carrier mobility and substrate binding.In an initial report, cells were selected in the presence of MTX with 5-CHO-THF as the folate substrate to mimic conditions in which tumor cells develop resistance to antifolates in vivo. A drug-resistant line was identified with a serine to asparagine substitution at amino acid 46 (illustrated in Fig. 7) that resulted in a marked reduction in the transport of MTX, but with a much lesser decrease in 5-CHO-THF and 5-CH3-THF influx (16Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The relative conservation of tetrahydrofolate cofactor transport explained, in part, how tumors that develop resistance to MTX in vivo can meet their requirement for folates when the major circulating folate in the blood of man and rodents is 5-CH3-THF.This report focuses on the development of L1210 leukemia cell lines with acquired resistance to MTX under conditions in which folic acid was the sole folate source. In L1210 cells, as well as other mammalian cells, the affinity of RFC1 for folic acid is very low (5Henderson G.B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1990; 10: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 24Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 29Goldman I.D.

NCI Monogr. 1987; 5: 27-35PubMed Google Scholar) and the majority of influx is mediated by different route(s) (23Yang C.-H. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Assaraf Y.G. Babani S. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8106-8111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hence the loss of RFC1 activity minimally affects the viability of cells in a growth medium supplemented with 2.3 μm folic acid (32Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar, 33Spinella M.J. Brigle K.E. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 4732-4734PubMed Google Scholar), and all mutants with impaired MTX transport can be cloned and the properties of the carrier characterized. A number of MTX transport-defective L1210 clones were isolated under these conditions. This report describes a mutation isolated from one of these clonal lines, L1210-C8a, that resulted in a glutamate to lysine substitution at amino acid 45, one amino acid away from the mutation described in our recent report (16Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Alterations in transport activity mediated by RFC1 can be associated with changes in the level of carrier expression or mutations in the carrier that result in alterations in the influx K tand/or V max. In the previous report, alterations in the transport of MTX and reduced folates produced by the substitution of asparagine for serine at amino acid 46 were consistent with markedly different substrate-dependent changes in the mobility of the loaded carrier with minimal or no changes in the substrate binding affinities (16Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the present study the glutamate to lysine substitution at amino acid 45 produced a carrier species with a marked reduction in the influx V max for 5-CHO-THF. Indeed, because of the apparent 4.5-fold higher level of carrier expression in the transfectant (assuming comparable levels of translation), the mobility of the loaded mutated carrier is likely to be considerably lower than the 12-fold measured decrease in theV max in the transfectant relative to the wild type cells. This was, however, associated with a 3-fold decrease in the influx K t; hence there was enhancement of binding, but to a much smaller extent than the decline inV max.The V max for MTX and folic acid influx mediated by the mutated carrier could not be measured directly, but inhibition of 5-CHO-THF influx by these folates could be quantitated. By this approach the influx K i for folic acid decreased by a factor of 7, and the K i for MTX increased by a comparable extent in the transfectant relative to L1210 cells. This suggests that the K t of the mutated carrier for both these substrates is essentially the same unlike parental L1210 cells in which the K t values differ by a factor of at least 50. An increase in folic acid influx in the MTXrA-E45K cells is attributed to both the increased affinity of the mutated carrier for folic acid and the 4.5-fold higher level of carrier expression in the transfectant relative to L1210 cells. That the measured folic acid influx in MTXrA-E45K cells was much smaller than expected is attributed to the fact that only a small component of the influx in L1210 cells is mediated by the carrier (23Yang C.-H. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Hence, what might be expected to be a nearly 30-fold increase in influx via RFC1 is translated into only a 2-fold change in the total influx.Phenyalanine substitution for isoleucine at amino acid 48 resulted in an even larger decrease in the folic acid influx K t, although in this case MTX influx was largely preserved (17Tse A. Brigle K.E. Moran R.G. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 162Google Scholar). 2Richard G. Moran, personal communication. Glutamate 45 and isoleucine 48 are separated by two residues but are likely to be in proximity in an aqueous pocket in the cell membrane since 3.6 amino acids are required to create a full turn within the helix. Hence, both sites appear to play a key role in folic acid binding. A tryptophan to glycine substitution in the predicted third transmembrane domain also markedly increased carrier affinity for folic acid (17Tse A. Brigle K.E. Moran R.G. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 162Google Scholar)2raising the possibility that there may be interactions between these regions in the folded carrier protein. In any event, these observations suggest that the first transmembrane domain plays a key role in determining the functional properties of RFC1 and is likely to be a mutation cluster region when cells are placed under antifolate selective pressure. These mutations are illustrated in Fig. 7, the predicted secondary structure of RFC1.In a recent report, a single amino acid change in the predicted external loop between the seventh and eighth transmembrane domains of RFC1 (also indicated in Fig. 7) from two different murine tumor cell lines was associated with a 3-fold difference in the influxK m without a change in V max(35Roy K. Tolner B. Chiao J.H. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2526-2531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The present study and another report (17Tse A. Brigle K.E. Moran R.G. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 162Google Scholar) indicate that the binding of folates to RFC1 is influenced not only by amino acid residues in external loops but also by interactions with residues well within the transmembrane domain. This is not surprising since RFC1 manifests exchange phenomena that require some conformational changes as substrates are transported into and out of cells (36Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 233: 624-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At this point, however, alterations in rates of translocation of the carrier have been reported for mutations that only occur within transmembrane domains (16Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).A dramatic consequence of the mutation at amino acid 45 is a striking alteration in the effects of anions on transport mediated by RFC1. In L1210 cells, a broad spectrum of inorganic and organic anions inhibit carrier-mediated folate transport, a phenomenon that appears to be charge-related (24Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 25Yang C.-H. Sirotnak F.M. Dembo M. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 79: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The substitution of the negatively charged glutamate with the positively charged lysine changed the nature of this interaction; in cells transfected with the mutated carrier, inorganic monovalent anions were required for carrier function. Anions also produced differences in the influx kinetic parameters for 5-CHO-THF in L1210 and MTXrA-E45K cells. In wild type cells, removal of inorganic anions increased influx by decreasing the influxK t without a change in V max. This is consistent with competition at the same folate-binding site that is probably charge-related (24Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 25Yang C.-H. Sirotnak F.M. Dembo M. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 79: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, in cells that express the mutated carrier, inorganic anions increased theV max, but this was also accompanied by a small decrease in the influx K t.The data suggest that the conversion of a negative to a positive charge at amino acid 45 locks the carrier in an immobile position in the absence of inorganic anions in the transport medium. This might be due to attraction of the lysine to a negatively charged site, or repulsion by another positively charged residue, elsewhere in the carrier. According to this paradigm, small anions within an aqueous pocket neutralize the charge on lysine thereby restoring carrier mobility and substrate translocation. As this occurs, and transport is restored, all anions (mono- and polyanions) also interact with, and inhibit, binding of folates at a different site that accounts for anion inhibition in wild type cells, hence the parallel increase in influxK t in the presence of anions in the MTXrA-E45K transfectant. The capacity to restore carrier function was limited to the inorganic anions studied. Neither sulfate, phosphate, nor ATP stimulated influx of 5-CHO-THF at any concentration studied, a phenomenon that may be related to their larger bulk and poor access to the lysine residue. Their somewhat weaker inhibitory effects on 5-CHO-THF influx in MTXrA-E45K as compared with L1210 cells may be due to a decreased affinity of these anions for their usual inhibitory site in the mutated RFC1.Glutamate 45 is one of only two glutamic acid residues located in the predicted transmembrane spanning domains in murine RFC1(10). Glutamate 699 in the band 3 protein has been proposed to form a hydrogen bond with histidine 752 which is essential for band 3-mediated chloride transport (37Muller-Berger S. Karbach D. Kang D. Aranibar N. Wood P.G. Ruterjans H. Passow H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9325-9332Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hence it is possible that the RFC1 phenotype observed in MTXrA-E45K cells might be related to a loss of interaction between glutamate 45 and the histidine 289 residues, the only conserved histidine in the transmembrane domains. The specific role of the glutamate moiety will be further clarified by ongoing studies employing site-directed mutagenesis at this site. Folates are key elements in mammalian biosynthetic processes, and even subtle folate deficiency has been implicated in developmental defects (1Daly L.E. Kirke P.N. Molloy A. Weir D.G. Scott J.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1995; 274: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions (2Butterworth C.E. Bendich A. Butterworth C.E. Health and Disease.

Med. Assoc. 1998; 279: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Since diffusion of folates into cells is a slow process, particularly at their low levels present in blood under physiological conditions, cells must meet their folate requirement through facilitated or energy-requiring transport processes (5Henderson G.B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1990; 10: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Sirotnak F.M. Goldman I.D. Membrane Transport of Antineoplastic Agents.

The major route of folate delivery into cells is the reduced folate carrier (RFC1), 1The abbreviations used are: RFC1, reduced folate carrier; MTX, methotrexate; 5-CHO-THF, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate; 5-CH3THF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; TMQ, Trimetrexate; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: RFC1, reduced folate carrier; MTX, methotrexate; 5-CHO-THF, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate; 5-CH3THF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; TMQ, Trimetrexate; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s). a typical facilitative transmembrane protein with 12 predicted transmembrane domains. Uptake of MTX is also mediated by RFC1 and impaired MTX transport is a common mechanism of resistance in clinical regimens (8Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Ravindranath Y. Proefke S.A. Wong S.C. Gimotty P.

Of particular value in deciphering these properties are the functional changes that occur when the carrier is mutated under antifolate selective pressure in the presence of a variety of different folate substrates. This laboratory has initiated studies using chemical mutagenesis to define the structural requirements for the transport of folate compounds in murine leukemia cells. In the first report on this work a substitution of asparagine for serine at amino acid 46 in the first predicted transmembrane domain was described in cells that were selected in the presence of MTX with 5-CHO-THF as the sole folate source (16Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This mutation resulted in markedly impaired MTX transport, whereas sufficient transport capacity for 5-CHO-THF was retained to minimally affect the growth requirement for this essential substrate. In the present report a second mutation is characterized in an adjacent amino acid, 45, that occurred in cells subjected to MTX selective pressure with folic acid as the sole folate source. This substitution of a lysine for glutamate resulted in a marked loss of antifolate and reduced folate transport but enhanced carrier-mediated transport of folic acid. This mutation also resulted in a qualitative change in the effects of anions on the carrier-mediated transport of folates, producing an altered carrier that absolutely requires, rather than is only inhibited by, the presence of extracellular inorganic anions for folate entry into cells. These observations, along with additional work from this (16Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and other laboratories (17Tse A. Brigle K.E. Moran R.G. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 162Google Scholar), indicate that the first putative transmembrane domain is an important site of interactions between RFC1 and folates that affects substrate binding and translocation and is a critical region for the development of mutations, in the presence of antifolate selective pressure, that produce highly diverse functional consequences. DISCUSSIONThis laboratory has initiated studies that characterize the relationship between structure and function of the murine RFC1 using chemical mutagens to generate a broad spectrum of mutations within the c"

Although normally used as an antioxidant, PDTC has been shown to exert pro-oxidant activity on proteins both in vitro and in vivo. Because p53 redox status has been shown to alter its DNA binding capability, we decided to test the effect of PDTC on p53 activation. In this communication, we report that PDTC inhibits the activation of temperature-sensitive murine p53Val-135 (TSp53) in the transformed rat embryo fibroblast line, A1-5, as well as wild-type human p53 in the normal diploid fibroblast line, WS1neo. In A1-5 cells, PDTC abrogated UV- and temperature shift-induced TSp53 nuclear translocation and p53-mediated transactivation of MDM2. PDTC also blocked UV-induced accumulation of wild-type p53 in WS1neo cells. Continual presence of PDTC was required for its effect as both UV-induced nuclear translocation and accumulation resumed after PDTC removal. We next investigated whether PDTC treatment altered the p53 redox state. We found that PDTC increased p53 cysteine residue oxidation in vivo. This represents the first direct evidence showing that the p53 redox state can be altered in vivo and that increased oxidation correlates with its inability to perform its downstream functions.

This represents the first direct evidence showing that the p53 redox state can be altered in vivo and that increased oxidation correlates with its inability to perform its downstream functions. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is believed to play an important role in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing tumorigenesis. A high frequency of gene-inactivating mutations observed in a wide variety of human cancers demonstrates the importance of functional inactivation of p53 in cell malignancy (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6727) Google Scholar). Part of the mechanism of its function is based on its transcription regulation of some crucial genes, such as WAF1/CIP1/SDI1, a cyclin kinase inhibitor that leads to cell growth suppression (2el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7916) Google Scholar, 3Harper J.W.

Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar, 5Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of p53 appears to be essential to mediate downstream events (6Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Nuclear accumulation of p53 is mediated by three specific nuclear localization signals inherent in the primary structure of the protein, which encompass residues 310–319, 369–375, and 379–384 (6Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Mutations in the first nuclear localization signal (residues 310–319) hinder its nuclear translocation and result in inactivation of its transformation suppressor function (7Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Tosky M.S. Levine A.J. Rotter V. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2055-2065PubMed Google Scholar, 8Slingerland J.M. Jenkins J.R. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, some mechanisms of p53 inactivation appear to prevent the ability of p53 to reside in the nucleus without mutating the p53 gene. For example, in some inflammatory breast cancers, undifferentiated neuroblastomas and retinoblastoma cells expressing wild-type p53, the protein appears to be partially inactivated by cytoplasmic sequestration (9Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 10Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1530-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the high tumorigenesis rate in the livers of transgenic mice expressing the hepatitis B viral HBx protein is probably linked to the sequestration and functional inactivation of p53 in the cytoplasm by the HBx protein (12Ueda H. Ullrich S.J. Gangemi J.D. Kappel C.A. Ngo L. Feitelson M.A. Jay G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Other types of p53 inactivation have been reported in cancers. A well-characterized example is the degradation of p53 by human papillomavirus (HPV) 1The abbreviations used are: HPV, human papillomavirus; DHR, dihydrorhodamine 123; DTT, dithiotheitol; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorter; IF, indirect immunofluorescence; MPB, 3-(maleimidopropioryl)biocytin; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; ROI, reactive oxygen intermediate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: HPV, human papillomavirus; DHR, dihydrorhodamine 123; DTT, dithiotheitol; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorter; IF, indirect immunofluorescence; MPB, 3-(maleimidopropioryl)biocytin; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; ROI, reactive oxygen intermediate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. E6 protein in cervical cancer. The E6 oncoprotein, expressed by oncogenic subtypes of HPV, binds p53 and directs its destruction through a ubiquitin-mediated pathway (13Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a defective p53 response to ionizing radiation is observed in cells lacking the ATMgene, the gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia patients (14Xu Y. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). After γ-radiation, p53 in such cells is not correctly induced, thus, impairing its G1 arrest function (14Xu Y. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 15Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar). Finally, the MDM2 cellular oncoprotein appears to be required to regulate p53 levels and its transactivation activity. Abnormal overexpression ofMDM2 can lead to p53 inhibition in a variety of cancers (16Piette J. Neel H. Maréchal V. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,17Momand J. Zambetti G.P. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 64: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Various forms of stress, such as ionizing radiation, UV radiation, medium depletion, hypoxia, heat shock, ribonucleotide depletion, and calcium phosphate treatment, lead to the induction of p53 protein level and the accumulation of transcriptionally active p53 inside the nucleus (18Dover R. Jayaram Y. Patel K. Chinery R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1181-1184PubMed Google Scholar, 19Renzing J. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1865-1868PubMed Google Scholar, 20Leonardo A.D. Linke S.P. Clarkin K.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 934-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Several other transactivators, such as NF-κB, AP-1, and Egr-1, can also be activated by UV radiation and other types of stressors (25Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 26Huang R.-P. Wu J.-X. Fan Y. Adamson E.D. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). How stressors stimulate cellular responses is not completely known. One hypothesis is that reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), commonly produced by many of these stressors, act as second messengers for the activation of these transactivators. Paradoxically, the DNA binding activity of some of these transactivators, including p53, is dependent on maintaining a low redox potential of these proteins (28Toledano M.B. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 29Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P.

In order to properly control the activation of these important transactivators, it is possible that the redox state of these proteins is highly regulated inside the cell. In this study, we investigated p53 activation in intact cells by analyzing the effects of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a widely used compound in redox regulation studies of NF-κB and AP-1 (25Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar,31Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13422-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). PDTC contains two thiol moieties that can chelate metal ions and may exert either antioxidant or pro-oxidant effects (33Orrenius S. Nobel C.S.I. van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Burkitt M.J. Slater F.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that PDTC inhibits p53 nuclear translocation and p53 induction. The inhibitory action of PDTC is not mediated by scavenging peroxides, but rather through alteration of the p53 redox state. The A1-5 rat embryo fibroblast cell line was maintained and grown in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4500 mg/liter glucose and 2 mml-glutamine (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts), and penicillin (100 units/ml)-streptomycin (100 mg/ml) solution (Irvine Scientific) with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. WS1neo and WS1E6 cell lines were kind gifts from Drs. Geoffrey Wahl and Steven Linke at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) with 1× nonessential amino acids (Irvine Scientific), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). PDTC and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were purchased from Sigma. Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR), 3-(maleimidopropioryl)biocytin (MPB) and NutrAvidin were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Dithiothreitol (DTT) was purchased from Fisher Biotech (Fair Lawn, NJ). Slide chambers were from Nunc, Inc. (Naperville, IL). All antibodies used in this study (except PAb421) were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). A1-5 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates (5 × 105 cells) or 2-well slide chambers (3 × 104 cells) and grown at 37 °C overnight followed by incubation at 39 °C for another 24 h. Medium was removed, and cells were exposed to UV radiation from a germicidal lamp (254 nm) at 1.7–1.9 J/m2/sec monitored by a radiometer (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). After UV treatment, prewarmed fresh medium was applied to the cultures, and they were returned to the incubator. For human diploid fibroblast lines, a 1:3 dilution of WS1neo and 1:5 dilution of WS1E6 from a confluent 10-cm plate were used to seed the plates 1 day prior to the treatment. IF staining was carried out as described previously (34Sepehrnia B. Paz I.B. Dasgupta G. Momand J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15084-15090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The intensity of fluorescence in the cytoplasm and nucleus was quantified from film negatives using IPLab Gel software (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). For each densitometric value, 20 cells were counted, and the S.D. was calculated using Microsoft Excel software (version 2.0). Percentage of nuclear intensity was calculated by dividing the nuclear fluorescence level by the nuclear plus the cytoplasmic fluorescence level. A1-5 cells were grown at 37 °C overnight followed by incubation at 39 °C (or 32 °C as control) for another 24 h. Prewarmed (32 °C) medium with or without PDTC was then supplied to the cells before switching them to 32 °C for further incubation at time periods indicated in the figure legends. At each indicated time point, cells were washed once with 5 ml of PBS (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) and harvested in 2 ml of cold PBS with a cell scraper. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 1600 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge (Beckman model T J-6) for 5 min and stored at −80 °C. Pellets from 10-cm plates were ruptured by sonication in 1 ml (if A1-5 cells were used) or 100 μl (if WS1neo or WS1E6 were used) of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) freshly supplied with proteinase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm E64, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm aprotinin). Soluble protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad), and 40 μg (or other amount as indicated) of total protein was resolved on a 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Protein transfer to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) and Western blotting were performed as described previously (35Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15084-15090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or DO-1 was used as the primary antibody to detect p53 from A1-5 cells or human fibroblasts respectively. IPLab Gel software was used to quantify band intensities. Levels of peroxides were determined by FACS analysis as described elsewhere (26Huang R.-P. Wu J.-X. Fan Y. Adamson E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Briefly, A1-5 cells, growing at 39 °C, were preincubated with 4 μmDHR for 30 min followed by 50 J/m2 UV radiation or changing of the incubation temperature to 32 °C. After UV radiation or temperature shift, DHR incubation was continued for 30 min more in the presence or absence of PDTC. The intensity of fluorescence of rhodamine 123 (wavelength 500–540 nm), which was converted intracellularly from DHR, was assessed from 50,000 cells by flow cytometry with an excitation source of 488 nm. This procedure is a modified form of the method described by Bayer et al. (36Bayer E.A. Safars M. Wilchek M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells (1.4 × 106) were seeded into 15-cm plates. For each condition, two 15-cm plates were used. Frozen cell pellets were lysed by sonication in 1 ml of SEE (0.1 msodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mmEGTA) with 20 mm NEM and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation to remove insoluble material and subsequent protein concentration measurements, soluble lysates were diluted to 0.6 mg/ml with SEE plus NEM and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation on wet ice for 30 min, diluted lysates were individually dialyzed against SEE overnight with one change of buffer after the first 4 h. To reduce oxidized sulfhydryl groups, DTT was added to 1.5 ml of sample to a concentration of 20 mm. After 30 min of incubation on wet ice, the samples were individually dialyzed as described above. MPB (10 μg/ml) was added to DTT-treated or DTT mock-treated samples at 4 °C for 30 min followed by dialysis. Samples were again measured for protein concentration. Immunoprecipitation of 50 μg of each sample with a p53-specific antibody mixture (1.8 μg of PAb421 and 0.6 μg of PAb240) or 2.4 μg of anti-E1A antibody (negative control) was performed as described previously (34Sepehrnia B. Paz I.B. Dasgupta G. Momand J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15084-15090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Duplicate immunoprecipitations of each sample and SDS-PAGE were performed to determine the immunoprecipitation efficiency. After electroblotting to Immobilon-P membranes, one membrane was probed with NutrAvidin (avidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase) to detect proteins modified by MPB, and the other membrane was probed with PAb421 to determine the amount of p53 in each sample. To ensure that MPB modified proteins with disulfide linkages and not proteins with free sulfhydryl groups, two purified proteins were used as controls. One was bovine pancreas chymotrypsinogen (Worthington, Freehold, NJ), which has five disulfide linkages (37Matthews B.W. Sigler P.B. Henderson R. Blow D.M. Nature. 1967; 214: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The second was rabbit muscle aldolase (Worthington), which has eight free sulfhydryl groups/subunit but no disulfide linkages (38Heyduk T. Moniewska A. Kochman M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 874: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism of p53 activation, we used a transformed rat embryo fibroblast cell line, A1-5 (39Martinez J. Georgoff I. Martinez J. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), which expresses a high level of a temperature-sensitive mutant p53, TSp53. TSp53 is a protein that expresses a valine residue at codon 135 instead of alanine. This TSp53 is located in the cytoplasm at the nonpermissive temperature, 39 °C, but in the nucleus when cells are incubated at 32 °C (Fig. 1, far left panels) (39Martinez J. Georgoff I. Martinez J. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 40Ginsberg D. Michael-Michalovitz D. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the normal upstream p53 signaling pathway in this cell line is intact, we tested whether TSp53 was capable of translocating into the nucleus in response to UV radiation at the nonpermissive temperature. The ability of TSp53 to accumulate in the nucleus in response to UV radiation was tested by treating cells with 50 J/m2 of UVC light. As shown in Fig. 1 (top row), at 2 h post-irradiation, p53 started to appear in the nucleus, and by 6 h post-irradiation, 60% of the total cellular p53 was detected in the nucleus as compared with 29% prior to radiation (Figs. 1 and2 B). A time course study was also conducted to determine p53 nuclear accumulation after temperature shift from 39 to 32 °C (Fig. 1, bottom right three panels). After 2 h, p53 nuclear accumulation was apparent, and by 6 h, p53 nuclear accumulation was complete, with very little cytoplasmic p53 remaining. Although no change in p53 steady state level was observed after UV radiation or temperature shift (data not shown), the ability of TSp53 to respond to UV at the nonpermissive temperature suggests that the upstream pathway for p53 activation in response to DNA damage is intact in this cell line.Figure 2p53 nuclear translocation was suppressed in the presence of PDTC. A and B, at 39 °C, A1-5 cells were treated with 50 J/m2 UV radiation followed by further incubation at 39 °C in the presence or absence of 25 μm PDTC.

D, the percentage of nuclear p53 in the presence or absence of 25 μm PDTC during temperature shift from 39 to 32 °C. Cells were incubated in the presence or in the absence of PDTC for the indicated periods after temperature shift. After incubation with PDTC, cells were either immediately fixed or washed and allowed to incubate further at 32 °C (hrs pts, hours of incubation post-temperature shift).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of the thiol-containing agent PDTC on p53 activation was then investigated. When PDTC was applied to A1-5 cells immediately after UV treatment, TSp53 nuclear translocation was completely abrogated (Fig. 2 A). In the presence of PDTC, the proportion of cellular p53 residing inside the nucleus (25 and 30% at 2 and 4 h postirradiation, respectively) after UV treatment was similar to that of non-UV treated cells (29%) (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, PDTC also prevented TSp53 nuclear translocation induced by temperature shift. No increase of nuclear p53 was observed if PDTC was present during temperature shift from 39 to 32 °C, whereas a 4-fold increase was observed in the absence of PDTC (Fig. 2,C and D). The inhibition of TSp53 nuclear translocation by PDTC during temperature shift was dose-dependent. The presence of 5 μm PDTC had no effect on TSp53 nuclear translocation, whereas 10 μmshowed moderate inhibition. Only upon application of 20 μm or more PDTC was complete inhibition of translocation observed (data not shown). In sum, we observe the prevention of both UV- and temperature shift-mediated TSp53 nuclear translocation by PDTC. In order to confirm that p53 activity was inhibited, the expression of a p53 downstream effector, MDM2, was examined. To do this, we shifted the incubation temperature of A1-5 cells from 39 to 32 °C to induce MDM2 expression (4Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar, 5Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3 we show that p53 normally activates MDM2 protein expression within 2 h after shifting the incubation temperature (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). However, in the presence of PDTC, temperature shift failed to induceMDM2 expression (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and9). This suggests that by excluding p53 from the nucleus, PDTC is able to prevent p53-mediated transactivation ofMDM2. It should be noted that we found no induction of MDM2 after UV treatment. The lack of MDM2 induction by the high dose of UV may be due to transcriptional repression of MDM2 (41Saucedo L.J. Carstens B.P. Seavey S.E. Albee II L.d. Perry M.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar, 42Vichi P. Coin F. Renaud J.-P. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Moras D. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7444-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) or because p53 fails to adopt a transcriptionally competent state inside the nucleus at the nonpermissive temperature. To further characterize the inhibitory effect, we tested whether the continual presence of PDTC was required to prevent temperature shift-induced p53 nuclear translocation. PDTC was added to cells immediately after temperature shift to prevent p53 translocation but removed after 2 h. The cells were then maintained for another 6 h at the permissive temperature with fresh medium. When both the p53 localization and the expression of MDM2 were examined, we found that the removal of PDTC led to an increase in nuclear p53 level (Fig. 2 D, last column) and MDM2 expression (Fig. 3, lane 10). This demonstrates that p53 activity recovers once PDTC is removed. We then tested whether PDTC was continually required to prevent p53 nuclear translocation after UV treatment. Cells were pretreated with PDTC for 30 min prior to UV radiation. After UV treatment, fresh medium was added without PDTC. As shown in Fig. 4 (columns 4 and5) p53 accumulated into the nucleus within 4 h. All of the data demonstrate that PDTC prevents p53 translocation and its transactivation function and that PDTC must be continually present for its effect. Because all previous studies were conducted with TSp53, it was important to determine whether PDTC could also inhibit wild-type p53 activity in normal human diploid cells. The human fibroblast cell line WS1neo, expressing a retrovirally inserted neomycin resistance gene, was used for this study (24Linke S.P. Clarkin K.C. Leonardo A.D. Tsou A. Wahl G.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 934-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Previous work demonstrated that ionizing radiation and nucleotide depletion induce p53 expression and cell cycle arrest in these cells. As shown in Fig. 5, within 4 h after UV treatment, p53 levels increased 140% (2.4-fold). When PDTC was added to WS1neo cells, the UV-induced increase in p53 level was almost completely inhibited after 4 h (Fig. 5, lane 4 versus lane 5). In the presence of PDTC, p53 increased only 30% (1.3-fold) after UV treatment. Similar to A1-5 cells, inhibition by PDTC was reversible. Subsequent removal of PDTC after 4 h, followed by continual incubation in fresh medium, restored the p53 UV response. Thus, in UV-treated cells, the p53 level at 20 h after PDTC removal was identical to the p53 level in cells not treated with PDTC (Fig. 5,lanes 8 and 9). This demonstrates that, as in A1-5 cells, PDTC was able to temporarily inhibit the ability of p53 to respond to UV radiation. Curiously, after 24 h, we observed an intermediate p53 increase of approximately 90–150% in cells that were not exposed to UV light, both in the presence and the absence of a 4-h PDTC treatment (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). The cause of this intermediate p53 induction may be due to the mock treatment (medium removal and replenishment). However, the fact that the level of p53 induction was almost identical in these two samples indicates that PDTC alone had little effect on p53 induction. This experiment also shows that the UV-induced signal is maintained for at least 4 h during PDTC treatment, although p53 is not able to respond within this period due to the presence of PDTC. Whether this means that the damage elicited by UV is maintained throughout this period or a UV-mediated signal is stable throughout this period is unclear. Our data indicate that p53 is able to respond to UV up to 4 h post-irradiation. Surprisingly, we also observed an inhibition of HPV E6-mediated degradation of p53 by PDTC. Human fibroblasts expressing E6 (WS1E6) have no detectable p53 because E6 mediates rapid p53 degradation (43Crook T. Tidy J.A. Vousden K.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar,44Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3456) Google Scholar). As expected, no p53 was present before or after UV radiation in cells expressing E6 (Fig. 5, lanes 10 and 12). Nevertheless, p53 was observed in WS1E6 during PDTC treatment independent of UV radiation (Fig. 5, lanes 11 and13), and p53 degradation resumed within 10 h after the removal of PDTC (data not shown). The ability of PDTC to prevent p53 nuclear translocation, p53 induction, p53-mediated transactivation, and E6-mediated p53 rapid degradation suggests that PDTC may be able to directly interfere with p53 protein itself. ROIs such as superoxide anion (O⨪2), peroxides (ROOR), or hydroxyl radicals (OH·) are believed to act as secondary messengers in the signal transduction pathway of several transactivators. Because hydrogen peroxide alone was shown to induce nuclear accumulation of p53 (Refs. 23Sugano T. Nitta M. Ohmori H. Yamaizumi M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res."
https://openalex.org/W2080556515,"The secretory compartment is characterized by low luminal pH and high Ca2+ content. Previous studies in several cell types have shown that the size of the acidic Ca2+ pool, of which secretory granules represent a major portion, could be estimated by applying first a Ca2+ionophore followed by agents that collapse acidic pH gradients. In the present study we have employed this protocol in the insulin-secreting cell line Ins-1 to determine whether the Ca2+ trapped in the secretory granules plays a role in exocytosis. The results demonstrate that a high proportion of ionophore-mobilizable Ca2+ in Ins-1 cells resides in the acidic compartment. The latter pool, however, does not significantly contribute to the [Ca2+]i changes elicited by thapsigargin and the inositol trisphosphate-producing agonist carbachol. By monitoring membrane capacitance at the single cell level or by measuring insulin release in cell populations, we show that Ca2+ mobilization from nonacidic Ca2+ pools causes a profound and long lasting increase in depolarization-induced secretion, whereas breakdown of granule pH had no significant effect. In contrast, releasing Ca2+ from the acidic pool markedly reduces secretion. It is suggested that a high Ca2+ concentration in the secretory compartment is needed to sustain optimal exocytosis.

In contrast, releasing Ca2+ from the acidic pool markedly reduces secretion. It is suggested that a high Ca2+ concentration in the secretory compartment is needed to sustain optimal exocytosis. A rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is necessary to induce regulated secretion in most cell types (1Smith S.J. Augustine G.J.

In neurons, [Ca2+]i increases up to several hundred μm are needed to trigger vesicle fusion, whereas in endocrine cells, granule exocytosis appears to require lower [Ca2+]i rises (3Heidelberger R.

The time course of exocytosis also appears different in the two cell types. Synaptic vesicle fusion is very fast (μs) and abrupt, whereas granule fusion is slower and more sustained (3Heidelberger R.

Aside from these differences, important similarities exist between secretory vesicles and granules. Both secretory vesicles and granules contain large amounts of Ca2+ ions (10Hutton J.C. Penn E.J. Peshavaria M. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 11Nicaise G. Maggio K. Thirion S. Horoyan M. Keicher E. Biol.

The function traditionally attributed to the high Ca2+ content in the secretory compartment is the packaging and processing of intravesicular content (14Austin C.D. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1194-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Lang I.M. Schleef R.R. J. Biol.

More recently a granular localization of the type 3 InsP3 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3, inositol trisphosphate; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; Cm, membrane capacitance; Gm, membrane conductance; Gs, series conductance; Tg, thapsigargin; CCh, carbachol; F, farads. receptor has been suggested, based on high resolution immunocytochemistry of pancreatic β-cells (16Blondel O. Moody M.M. Depaoli A.M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Swift H. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7777-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the exocrine pancreas, evidence has been provided suggesting that the intragranular Ca2+ content is released by opening of low affinity InsP3 receptors (17Petersen O.H. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These conclusions, however, have recently been challenged (18Ravazzola M. Halban P.A. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2745-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and the role of granular Ca2+ remains elusive. Another line of evidence suggesting that intragranular Ca2+ is implicated in secretion comes from the recent identification of an acidic Ca2+-binding protein, granule lattice Protein 1 (Grl1p), in dense core secretory granules of Tetrahymena thermophilathat appears essential for regulated secretion (20Chilcoat N.D. Melia S.M. Haddad A. Turkewitz A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Another common feature between secretory vesicles and granules is their low luminal pH. They share this characteristic with the lysosomal/endosomal compartment and the trans-Golgi network (21Carnell L. Moore H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Indeed, the low pH of the lumen has proven a reliable means for determining the Ca2+ content of the so-called “acidic Ca2+ pool.” Since ionophores such as ionomycin or A23187 are largely ineffective in transporting Ca2+ from an acidic environment (28Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Girotti M. Marie S. Macdonald M.J. Wollheim C.B. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4895-4902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the pH gradient between lumen and cytosol must be collapsed before they can effectively release the Ca2+content of this pool into the cytoplasm (23Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bastianutto C. Clementi E. Codazzi F. Podini P. De Giorgi F. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T.

The aim of the present study was to establish whether the Ca2+ stored within the acidic pool is important in the late steps of exocytosis. For this purpose we employed as a model system the β-cell line Ins-1, an insulin-secreting cell line established from a rat insulinoma that, among different lines, best retains the phenotype of β-cells (27Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 28Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E.

Theler J.M. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1424-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Among other properties, Ins-1 cells display temperature-dependent and glucose-responsive secretion and, as shown here, temperature-dependent increases in membrane capacitance upon depolarizing pulses. Therefore, they can be used as an alternative to β-cells for studying secretion at the single cell level. By using capacitance measurements in combination with agents that mobilize Ca2+ and/or collapse intracellular pH gradients, the role of different intracellular Ca2+ pools in secretion has been assessed. We here demonstrate that, although a low pH in the granules is not required for the late steps of secretion, the level of intragranular Ca2+ significantly affects the secretory profile. Ins-1 cells were cultured as described previously (27Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 29Sekine N. Fasolato C. Pralong W.F. Theler J.M. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1424-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two days before the experiment, cells were trypsinized and plated on poly(l-lysine)-coated coverslips (diameter 24 mm; 105 cells/coverslip). Cells were loaded for 30 min at 37 °C with 2 μm fura-2/AM as described previously (26Pizzo P. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Coverslips were then bathed in 1 ml of Ringer's solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 33 °C. Cells were placed on the stage of an inverted microscope equipped with a 40× oil immersion objective (Zeiss, Germany) and connected to a digital video imaging system (Georgia Instruments, Roswell, GA). All experiments were performed at 31–33 °C. Excitation wavelengths were set at 340 and 380 nm. Fluorescence emission at 510 ± 15 nm was collected by a CCD camera, and 8 images were averaged/time point. Time series were acquired with a frame interval of 4 s, and images at both excitation wavelengths were stored on an optomagnetic disc recorder (Panasonic, Japan). All data were normalized to the first min base-line ratio. The total content of cellular Ca2+ under different conditions was assayed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Cells (20 × 107 cells/ml) were suspended in a Ca2+-free medium containing 1 mm EGTA and challenged with ionomycin (10 μm) alone or in combination with monensin (10 μm). Cell aliquots (107) were then centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in Eppendorf tubes containing 100 μl of sucrose 12.5% and 400 μl of silicon oil. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of a solution containing Triton (0.02%) and NaOH (0.2 n) before measurement. Unless otherwise specified, during electrophysiological recordings, cells were perfused at 31–33 °C with an external solution containing 118 mm NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5.6 mm CsCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.7 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4. Electrophysiological recordings and fura-2 fluorescence were performed in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique with a computer-based patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-9, HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) controlled by the Pulse software (HEKA). The internal solution consisted of 145 mm glutamic acid, 155 mm CsOH, 1 mm MgCl2, 8 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgATP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 0.1 mm fura-2 (or 0.1 mm BCECF), and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.2. Membrane capacitance (Cm) was measured with the “sine+dc” mode of the “lock-in” extension of the Pulse software, based on the Lindau-Neher algorithm (30Lindau M. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). An 800 Hz, 40 mV peak-to-peak sinusoid stimulus was applied to the DC holding potential of −80 mV. During a depolarizing pulse and 5 ms before and after the pulse, no sinewave was applied. No leak subtraction was performed on the evoked currents in the calculations used. After the whole-cell configuration was established, Cm was recorded and canceled by the automatic capacitance compensation of the EPC-9. The procedure was repeated every 180 s to prevent a possible saturation of the lock-in signal (31Von Rüden L. Neher E. Science. 1993; 262: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). For fast capacitance changes after depolarizing pulses, it has been reported that activation of a Na+ current can lead to transient increases in Cm not linked to exocytosis (ΔCt) (32Horrigan F.T. Bookman R.J. Biophys. J. 1993; 64 (abstr.): 101Google Scholar). ΔCt contributed maximally 10% of the initial ΔCm and returned to zero within 100 ms after the depolarization. To reduce its contribution on ΔCm measurements, the first 100 ms of the trace was discarded. The capacitance values of the following 200 ms were averaged and compared with the capacitance values before the depolarization to obtain the ΔCm reported in Figs. 6 and 7.Figure 7Long lasting effect of the ionomycin-enhanced stimulation of regulated secretion.

Calculation of [Ca2+]i was performed on the calibrated ratio values (360 nm/380 nm), whereR min (0.86), R max (6.07), and K-factor (1.68 ×10−3) were obtained by an internal calibration procedure. The fura-2 fluorescence, the holding current, the lock-in, and other parameters were synchronously recorded also at low resolution (3 Hz) by the X-Chart extension of the Pulse software (HEKA). Time courses of Cm as shown in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 were obtained from the Cm trace, recorded at low frequency by a point-by-point subtraction.

[Ca2+]i (upper panels) and Cm changes (lower panels) were measured as described in Fig. 4 in cells challenged, respectively, with 2 μm monensin/5 mm EGTA (A), 1 μm ionomycin/5 mm EGTA (B), 1 μm ionomycin/2 μm monensin/5 mmEGTA (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ionomycin and monensin were prepared from stock solution in Me2SO (or ethanol) (0.4% final concentration) in the Ca2+-free external solution containing 5 mmEGTA to prevent cells from loading with extracellular Ca2+in the presence of ionomycin. All drugs were applied by local pressure from a wide-tipped micropipette (5–10 μm) positioned close to the cell. Superfusion experiments on Ins-1 cell suspensions were performed as described previously (34Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In short, cells were brought into suspension and placed in 1-ml superfusion chambers at a density of 106 cells/chamber. The cells were superfused at a rate of 1 ml/min at 37 °C, and test substances were introduced with the buffer. One-min fractions were collected and subjected to an insulin radioimmunoassay. For presentation, the KCl-induced stimulation of the second pulse was integrated and normalized to that of the first pulse. fura-2/AM, fura-2 free acid, BCECF free acid, and Pluronic F-127 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA); culture media and sera were from Technogenetics (Milan, Italy); and other chemicals were from Sigma. When [Ca2+]i was monitored by fura-2 in intact cells bathed in a medium containing CaCl2 (2 mm) and glucose (5.6 mm), approximately 50% of the cells displayed asynchronous oscillations of [Ca2+]i, whose frequency and amplitude largely depended on the cell batch (29Sekine N. Fasolato C. Pralong W.F. Theler J.M. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1424-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, the [Ca2+]ikinetics from several individual cells were averaged, leading to a partial masking of the initial oscillations. The addition of EGTA immediately abolished these oscillations and caused a decrease in the base-line ratio, indicating that they depend on Ca2+influx. The presence of acidic Ca2+ pools and their contribution to [Ca2+]i rises were evaluated with the protocol previously employed in other cell lines (23Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bastianutto C. Clementi E. Codazzi F. Podini P. De Giorgi F. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J.

In Fig. 1 A, after EGTA addition, the fast-exchangeable Ca2+ pool was released by the Ca2+ pump inhibitor thapsigargin (Tg) (1 μm). The subsequent addition of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (1 μm) led to a small, further increase in [Ca2+]i, indicating that in these cells the large majority of the ionomycin-sensitive pool is represented by the Tg-sensitive one. Release of the acidic Ca2+ pool was then achieved by the addition of the Na+/H+exchanger monensin (2 μm). Qualitatively similar data have been obtained by addition of the weak base chloroquine (40 μm), used in place of monensin to dissipate the intraluminal pH gradients. The increase in [Ca2+]i after monensin (or chloroquine) application requires the pretreatment with ionomycin (26Pizzo P. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In fact, addition of either drug alone was without appreciable effect on [Ca2+]i (data not shown). Integrating peak areas showed that the amount of Ca2+ residing in acidic compartments was, on average, 51.3 ± 3.6% (n = 4) of total releasable Ca2+. The amount of Ca2+released from the different Ca2+ pools was also assayed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. In controls (unstimulated conditions), the total content of cellular Ca2+ was estimated to be 5.7 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein (n = 3). Ionomycin alone or ionomycin and monensin together released 2.4 ± 1.1 and 4.5 ± 0.4 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein, respectively (n = 3). Thus, of the total releasable Ca2+, about 54% was released by ionomycin alone; the remaining 46% was then attributed to the Ca2+content selectively released from the acidic pool. We functionally tested for the existence of InsP3 receptors on granules. Fig. 1 B shows that InsP3production, induced by the muscarinic agonist carbachol (CCh, 0.5 mm), reduced the Tg-sensitive pool but had no effect on the size of the peak induced by monensin application. In fact, in the presence of CCh, the acidic pool represented 49 ± 1.7% (n = 7) of total mobilizable Ca2+. Finally, Fig. 1 C shows that pretreatment with Tg abolished the peak in [Ca2+]i induced by CCh, indicating that in this cell type, InsP3- and Tg-sensitive pools fully overlap. Altogether the data demonstrate that acidic Ca2+compartments in Ins-1 cells are depleted neither by InsP3produced by receptor stimulation nor by inhibition of Tg-sensitive pumps. Fig. 2shows fast changes in Cm, membrane conductance (Gm) as well as series conductance (Gs) before and after a 200-ms depolarizing pulse from −80 mV holding potential to 0 mV. With 200-ms pulses, individual cells displayed ΔCm ranging from 20 to 400 fF with an average of 49.2 ± 4.4 fF (mean ±S.E., n = 76). Increasing the pulse duration to 400 ms led to an increase in ΔCm of 60% when compared with a 200-ms depolarizing pulse in 4 of 9 cells (data not shown). However, these longer depolarizing pulses caused a rapid rundown of the evoked Ca2+ currents. We therefore decided to perform the experiments with 200-ms pulse duration. By following Cm at a lower frequency (3 Hz) it can be seen that upon such a depolarization ΔCm remained constant for up to 4 min before a rundown in secretion was observed, as long as these pulses were at least 20 s apart (Fig. 3 A). This result indicates that secretion in Ins-1 cells is not easily “exhaustible” by successive 200-ms depolarizing pulses. With this protocol, maximum secretion increased the initial membrane capacitance by about 10% and was equivalent to fusion of approximately 300 granules (n = 13) (assuming the mean diameter of the insulin-containing granules to be 250 nm and a membrane capacitance of 1 μF/cm2). However, since an interval of 20 s is too short to apply test substances between subsequent depolarizations, the interpulse duration was increased to 90 s. From the time course of ΔCm, we also noticed that, upon depolarization, the majority of the cells (65%) displayed only an increase in Cm; in the remaining 35%, slow endocytotic processes were observed after the first and, occasionally, the second pulse (see Fig. 3 B), whereas large, abrupt endocytotic events were never observed under our experimental conditions. In addition to Cm and Ca2+ current, the [Ca2+]i was monitored as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As can be seen in Fig. 4 A, the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i peaks decreased upon subsequent depolarizations, whereas the integrated [Ca2+]ipeaks and Ca2+ currents (ΔIp) (Fig. 4 C) as well as ΔCm (Fig. 4 B) remained unchanged. The decrease in [Ca2+]i peak amplitude is probably due to the relatively slow influx of fura-2 from the pipette, leading to changes in the Ca2+ buffering capacity of the intracellular medium during prolonged incubations (35Helmchen F. Borst J.G.G. Sakmann B. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1458-1471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We first tested if drug application by itself induced ΔCm. From the low frequency recording of Cm it can be seen that during application of ionomycin, monensin, or the combination of the two, an increase in Cm occurred (Fig. 5 A–C,lower panels). Since similar increases were observed when the solvents ethanol or Me2SO were tested and when experiments were performed at room temperature to inhibit regulated secretion (36Renström E. Eliasson L. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we conclude that to a large extent the observed changes are due to the solvent. Chloroquine, on the other hand, being dissolved in Ringer's solution, had no effect. We also tested whether drug application changed the intracellular pH; therefore in some experiments BCECF was included in the intracellular solution instead of fura-2. These experiments showed that application of none of the drugs, applied alone or in combination, significantly altered the cytosolic pH when cells were kept in the whole-cell configuration (data not shown). To determine the role of the granular Ca2+ content in granule fusion, the increases in Cm in response to 200-ms depolarizing pulses were thus monitored immediately before and after application of the different drugs. Changes in Cm at the second and subsequent depolarizing pulses were normalized to the change obtained in the first pulse. When ΔCm was monitored in untreated, control cells after this normalization protocol, it remained stable during the second depolarization (Fig. 6, n= 40). Figs. 5 B and 6 show that, after a brief application of ionomycin, the subsequent depolarizing pulse caused a consistently larger increase in ΔCm (47 ± 12%, n = 10). The increase in ΔCm after the ionomycin pulse was relatively long lasting since it was maintained for at least 3 min and did not depend on larger Ca2+ currents during subsequent depolarizations (compare Figs. 7, A andB). Application of chloroquine between the first and the second pulse had no effect (n = 6), whereas monensin led to a quite variable stimulation (Figs. 5 A and 6). On average, however, the stimulation caused by monensin treatment between two successive depolarizing steps was not statistically significant (23 ± 21%,n = 9; see also Fig. 7). A completely different pattern was observed when the Ca2+ionophore and chloroquine (or monensin) were applied together in order to discharge the Ca2+ content of the acidic pools. The ΔCm increase following the depolarizing step, elicited after the discharge of the acidic Ca2+ pools (Figs. 5 C and6), was reduced not only with respect to the potentiation caused by ionomycin (46 ± 13%, n = 17, monensin/ionomycin; 54 ± 9%, chloroquine/ionomycin, n = 6) but was also reduced with respect to untreated control cells (21 ± 9%, monensin/ionomycin; 31 ± 2%, chloroquine/ionomycin). The reduction in ΔCm following the depolarizing step was also observed with further test pulses, i.e. it was prolonged for up to 3 min (Fig. 7 B). It is worth mentioning that there was no significant change in either Gm or Gs when the second depolarizing pulse was compared with the first pulse either in controls or treated cells (data not shown). Moreover, application of ionomycin, monensin, or the combination of ionomycin and monensin had no significant effect on changes in [Ca2+]i (ΔCa) (Fig. 5) and ΔIp of the subsequent depolarizing pulses (Fig. 7 A). The inhibition of secretion did not exceed more than 30% of the control values. A possible explanation for this incomplete inhibition is that a complete alkalinization by monensin or chloroquine (and therefore complete discharge of granule Ca2+) takes longer than the application time of 20 s used in our electrophysiological experiments. To test this possibility, studies were performed where the H+ exchanger was present for 5 min before the first depolarizing pulse was given, to ensure a complete breakdown of the pH gradient. After this prolonged incubation, secretion during the first depolarizing pulse was within the expected range of variability (43 ± 7.2 fF; n = 7). However, the prolonged treatment with monensin did not further increase the level of inhibition obtained when ionomycin was applied between the first and second pulses (24 ± 12%, n = 7; Fig. 6). To determine whether the reduction in ΔCm caused by acidic Ca2+ pool depletion was attributable, at least in part, to fusion of insulin-containing granules, we followed the release of insulin in populations of cells treated with protocols that mimic those used in Fig. 5. Cell suspensions obtained from monolayers were challenged with two pulses of 30 mm KCl of 1-min duration, 5 min apart. As summarized in Fig. 8, secretion during the second depolarizing pulse was 25 ± 4% (n = 3) of that obtained during the first challenge. This reduction in secretion probably reflects a reduction in readily releasable insulin granules, although a rundown of the Ca2+ peak after depolarization may also contribute to this effect (34Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One-min stimulation with 1 μm ionomycin between the first and second KCl pulses resulted in a less drastic reduction of insulin secretion (62 ± 24% that of initially released, n = 3). When a combination of ionomycin and chloroquine (or monensin) was employed, secretion during the second KCl pulse was 25 ± 11 and 24 ± 4% (n = 3), respectively; i.e. the potentiating effect of ionomycin was completely abolished. In the β-cell line Ins-1, as in other secretory cells, a relatively high proportion of intracellular Ca2+ appears to be stored in acidic structures. In fact, these cells respond with a large [Ca2+]i increase to the protocol previously employed to reveal this compartment, i.e. the application of drugs that collapse internal acidic pH gradients (monensin or chloroquine) after addition of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. The subcellular localization of acidic Ca2+pools has not been determined with certainty, although it is likely that in Ins-1 cells, as in other cell types, it is heterogeneous. A rough estimation of the contribution of insulin granules to the Ca2+ content of the acidic pool can be obtained by considering the total releasable Ca2+ of Ins-1 cells (4.5 nmol/mg of protein, this work), the cell volume occupied by the granules (1.2%), 2This value has been estimated considering that Ins-1 cells contain 10% of the insulin content of β-cells (27Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) and that in the latter cell type, the percentage volume occupied by granules is 11.5% based on morphometric analysis (37Dean P.M. Diabetologia. 1973; 9: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). and the releasable granule Ca2+ (about 125 nmol/mg of granule protein, Ref. 10Hutton J.C. Penn E.J. Peshavaria M. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). By using these parameters, intragranular Ca2+ mobilization could be as high as 1.5 nmol/mg of protein. We have shown here that in Ins-1 cells 46% (i.e.2.4 nmol/mg of protein) of the total releasable Ca2+ is due to the acidic pool. Although based on a number of assumptions, these values indicate that insulin granules represent a major part (more than 60%) of the acidic compartment in this cell type. The main goal of this investigation was to establish the role played by Ca2+ trapped in the secretory compartment in the process of secretion. To address this question, we first investigated whether or not the acidic compartment could contribute to (i) the [Ca2+]i changes induced in Ins-1 cells by the muscarinic agonist CCh and (ii) the [Ca2+]ichanges induced by depolarization. The finding that Ca2+mobilization induced by thapsigargin or InsP3 production through activation of muscarinic receptors does not affect the acidic pool is meaningful. In fact, given that insulin granules represent a large proportion of that pool, it confirms by a functional approach the conclusion of Ravazzola et al. (18Ravazzola M. Halban P.A. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2745-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that InsP3receptors are not expressed on the membrane of the secretory granules of β-cells. Similarly, a role for the acidic pool (and thus for insulin granules) in Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release is unlikely since the increase in [Ca2+]i caused by depolarization was indistinguishable in controls and cells whose acidic pool had been depleted (Fig. 5). We next tested the possibility that intragranular Ca2+plays a role in the secretory process by monitoring membrane capacitance in single Ins-1 cells under different experimental conditions. In untreated cells, the magnitude of ΔCm has a tendency to decrease during a series of successive pulses; however up to the fourth pulse (i.e. 300 s), ΔCm is fairly constant. On the contrary, manipulation of intracellular Ca2+ in the time interval between the first and the second depolarizing pulses significantly changed the extent of secretion. In fact, depletion of Ca2+ from nonacidic stores led to a prolonged stimulation of secretion up to 50%. Such a priming action of ionomycin has been described previously (4Augustine G.J. Neher E. J. Physiol. 1992; 450: 247-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), but the fact that it can last for several min at resting [Ca2+]i is a novel observation. Releasing Ca2+ from the ionomycin-sensitive compartments may favor granule recruitment from a distant cytoskeletal-anchored pool (38Li G. Rungger-Brandle E. Just I. Jonas J-C. Aktories K. Wollheim C.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) or by promoting priming of granules at a late, post-docking step (39Martin T.F.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such a priming has been previously described by mechanisms that cause long lasting phases of moderately elevated [Ca2+]i (31Von Rüden L. Neher E. Science. 1993; 262: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In marked contrast with the potentiating effect of a brief increase in [Ca2+]i, releasing Ca2+ from the acidic compartments led to inhibition of secretion that reached 50% when compared with cells treated only with ionomycin. Since breakdown of the intracellular pH gradients by itself was without effect and the inhibition was observed with both monensin and chloroquine (two agents that act on pH gradients by different mechanisms), it can be concluded that the inhibitory effect is due to the release of Ca2+from the acidic organelles, including insulin granules. Since our alkalinization protocol is by no means specific for the granules, the question can be raised as to whether the reduction in secretion is due to the decrease in Ca2+ within the granules themselves or in other acidic compartments (trans-Golgi network or lysosomes). The observation that inhibition is maximal within a few tens of seconds after acidic Ca2+ pool discharge argues for a distal site of action, i.e. the granules themselves. It is probable that both insulin-containing granules and δ-aminobutyric acid-containing vesicles contribute to the increases in Cm monitored by us and by other groups (7Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-296Google Scholar, 40Takahashi N. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 41Thomas-Reetz A.C. De Camilli P. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the fact that Ca2+ depletion from nonacidic and acidic compartments affects both Cm increases and insulin secretion in radioimmunoassay suggests that at least part of the effects seen in our study reflects fusion of insulin-containing granules. A high intragranular Ca2+ concentration may be important for docking or priming of the granules for the fusion process itself or for all of the steps. It is noteworthy that a protein called Grl1p, abundant in secretory granules of T. thermophila (20Chilcoat N.D. Melia S.M. Haddad A. Turkewitz A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is sensitive to both Ca2+ and pH. In conclusion, our experiments show that in Ins-1 cells, a relatively large amount of the stored Ca2+ resides in acidic compartments. A high [Ca2+] in this compartment but not a low pH is needed for optimal exocytosis. We are grateful to Clarissa Bartley for performing the superfusion experiments and the radioimmunoassays, M. Mancon for total Ca2+ measurements, and G. Ronconi and M. Santato for skillful assistance. We thank Drs. Aldebaran M. Hofer and Bruce G.

At −50 mV, theK 0.5succinate was 180 μm and the K 0.5Na+ was 19 mm. The Hill coefficient was 2.3, which is consistent with a transport stoichiometry of 3 Na+:1 divalent anion substrate.

The cDNA coding for the rabbit renal Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporter, NaDC-1, 1The abbreviations used are: NaDC-1, rabbit renal Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporter; NaSi-1, Na+/sulfate cotransporter; SGLT1, rabbit Na+/glucose cotransporter. has been cloned and sequenced (5Pajor A.M.

Physiol. 1996; 271: C1808-C1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NaDC-1 belongs to a distinct gene family of sodium-coupled anion transporters that includes the Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporters, hNaDC-1, from human kidney (7Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F642-F648PubMed Google Scholar), and NaDC-2, from Xenopus intestine (8Bai L. Pajor A.M. Am. J.

A. 1993; 90: 8073-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The transport mechanism of NaDC-1 is thought to involve the ordered binding of four charged substrates: 3 Na+ ions and 1 divalent anion substrate (10Hirayama B. Wright E.M. Pflugers Arch. 1986; 407: S174-S179Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1093-F1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wright S.H. Hirayama B.

Experiments with rabbit renal brush border membrane vesicles support this hypothesis: sodium-dependent transport of succinate was affected by changes in membrane potential, and transport of succinate also caused a depolarization of membrane potential (12Wright S.H. Hirayama B. Kaunitz J.D. Kippen I. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5456-5462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schell R.E. Wright E.M. J.

However, the dependence of transport kinetics on membrane voltage is not known, and there have been no direct measurements of currents associated with Na+/dicarboxylate cotransport. In this study, we have used a two-electrode voltage clamp to study the kinetics of succinate transport by NaDC-1 expressed inXenopus oocytes. The results show that NaDC-1 is electrogenic, with a stoichiometry of 3 Na+ per succinate. Negative membrane potentials increase succinate transport. The apparent affinity of the transporter for Na+ is increased by negative membrane voltage, whereas succinate binding is relatively voltage-independent. The cation selectivity of NaDC-1 is unique. Although Na+ is the preferred cation, Li+ can support transport. However, succinate transport is inhibited when one of the three cation binding sites in NaDC-1 is occupied by Li+. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the transport mechanism of NaDC-1 and the inhibitory action of lithium on renal dicarboxylate transport. Stage V and VI oocytes from Xenopus laevis (NASCO) were dissected and defolliculated as described previously (5Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1093-F1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oocytes were injected with 50 nl of NaDC-1 cRNA (0.5 μg/μl) 1 day following isolation. Currents were measured 3–5 days later. The oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in Barth's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 2.5 mmsodium pyruvate, 50 mg/ml gentamicin. For experiments, oocytes were superfused with sodium buffer containing (in mm): 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5. For cation replacement experiments, sodium was replaced with an equimolar concentration of other cations, as chloride salts. The results reported are for single experiments that are representative of experiments repeated with oocytes from at least three donor frogs. Oocyte currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp method at 22 °C (15Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 16Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances <1 megohm, usually between 0.4 and 0.8 megohm. The voltage pulses were controlled with the pClamp6 program suite (Axon Instruments). Current-voltage relationships were obtained from a pulse protocol consisting of test voltages applied for 100 ms between +50 and −150 mV (in 20-mV decrements), with a holding potential of −50 mV. The results of three runs were averaged for each trial. Steady state substrate-dependent currents were fitted to the Hill/Michaelis-Menten equations using SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific) I=Imax*[S]n/{(K0.5)n+[S]n}where I is the current, I maxis the maximum current observed at saturating substrate concentrations,K 0.5 is the substrate concentration at half-maximal current, and n is the Hill coefficient. For the Michaelis-Menten equation, n = 1. The error bars for kinetic data represent errors of the fit. Current traces obtained in an oocyte injected with NaDC-1 cRNA are shown in Fig. 1. The addition of substrate in the presence of sodium induced inward currents (Fig. 1 B) compared with sodium buffer alone (Fig. 1 A). Inward currents of up to 3000 nA were measured in oocytes expressing NaDC-1, but not in control, uninjected oocytes (not shown). In Fig. 1 C, the steady state currents from Fig. 1, A and B, are plotted as a function of membrane potential. Fig. 1 D shows the substrate-dependent currents in NaDC-1, which are calculated from the difference between the currents in the presence and absence of succinate. In this experiment, the I–V curves were linear, although the I–V curves often showed saturation with more negative membrane potentials. In response to step changes in membrane voltage, NaDC-1 also exhibited pre-steady state charge movements (Fig. 1 A), which were reduced in the presence of substrate (Fig. 1 B). However, the pre-steady state charge movements in NaDC-1 were very rapid (time constants approximately 2–6 ms) and did not show saturation at the positive potentials tested. The pre-steady state charge movements in NaDC-1 were observed only in oocytes exhibiting very high expression of the transporter. The magnitude of the steady state currents in NaDC-1 was dependent on the concentration of succinate (Fig. 2, A andB). For each voltage, the data were fit to Equation 1, withn = 1. The maximal current, Imaxsuccinate, increased and saturated at hyperpolarizing membrane potentials (Fig. 2 C). At negative membrane potentials, the K0.5succinate was voltage-independent (Fig. 2D). For example, at −50 mV, the K0.5succinate was 180 μm and at −150 mV the K0.5succinate was 140 μm (Fig. 2 D). However, there was an increase in K0.5succinate to 270 μm at −10 mV. The substrate specificity of NaDC-1 was examined by measuring currents in the presence of 10 mm concentrations of test substrates. As shown in Fig. 3, four of the substrates tested produced larger currents than did succinate: methylsuccinate, citrate, fumarate, and tricarballylate. The currents seen in the presence of α-ketoglutarate and glutarate were about 50% of those reported for succinate, which could reflect a lower affinity of NaDC-1 for these substrates. For example, the K m for glutarate in NaDC-1 is approximately 6 mm (11Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1093-F1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), close to the 10 mm substrate concentration used in these studies. Small currents were measured in dimethylsuccinate, sulfate and pyruvate (Fig. 3). Finally, there were no detectable substrate-dependent currents with lactate, consistent with previous uptake studies (5Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Na+ is thought to be an essential activator of NaDC-1 (10Hirayama B. Wright E.M. Pflugers Arch. 1986; 407: S174-S179Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Wright S.H. Hirayama B. Kaunitz J.D. Kippen I. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5456-5462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium activation of succinate-dependent currents was measured under voltage-clamp conditions. The succinate-dependent currents in NaDC-1 were sigmoidal functions of Na+ concentration and showed saturation (Fig. 4 A). The maximum succinate-dependent current at saturating Na+ concentrations, ImaxNa+, was dependent on membrane potential, becoming larger and saturating at more negative membrane potentials (Fig. 4 B). The K0.5Na+ was strongly affected by membrane potential, decreasing from 19 mm at −50 mV to 9.7 mm at −150 mV (Fig. 4 C). The apparent Hill coefficient, n, was insensitive to voltage; n was 2.3 at −50 mV and 2.4 at −150 mV (Fig. 4 D). The largest succinate-dependent currents in NaDC-1 were seen in the presence of Na+ (Fig. 5). When Na+ was replaced by choline or Cs+, the inward currents were abolished. However, substrate-dependent inward currents were observed in Li+ (approximately 6–25% of the currents seen in Na+, depending on membrane potential), suggesting that Li+ supports succinate transport. This result verifies previous studies done with renal brush border membrane vesicles (3Wright E.M. Wright S.H. Hirayama B.A. Kippen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7514-7517Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). H+ appears to be a very poor substitute for Na+since only small (<−30 nA) substrate-induced currents were observed in choline at pH 5.5 (Fig. 5). There was no difference between the succinate-induced currents measured in Na+ at pH 7.5 and 5.5 (results not shown). The succinate-induced currents in lithium were measured as a function of increasing succinate concentrations (Fig. 6). As seen in Na+, there was saturation of the substrate-induced lithium currents with increasing concentrations of succinate. For comparison, the currents produced by 1 mm succinate in Na+in the same oocyte were −185 nA at −150 mV and −140 nA at −50 mV (not shown). As seen with Na+, the Imaxsuccinate for succinate-dependent currents in lithium increased with more negative membrane potentials. However, the effect of voltage on the Imaxsuccinate measured in lithium was more pronounced than in Na+ (see Fig. 2). Rather than saturating with hyperpolarizing membrane potentials (see Fig. 2), the Imaxsuccinate in Li+was supralinear (Fig. 6 C). The apparent affinity of NaDC-1 for succinate was lower in Li+ compared with Na+. The K0.5succinate measured in Li+ was approximately 3 mm (Fig. 6 D) compared with 0.18 mm in Na+ (Fig. 2). The K0.5succinate in Li+was relatively insensitive to changes in voltage (Fig. 6 D). Lithium is both an activator and an inhibitor of succinate transport by NaDC-1 (3Wright E.M. Wright S.H. Hirayama B.A. Kippen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7514-7517Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), consistent with competition for the same cation binding site. As shown in Fig. 7, the addition of 5 mm Li+ resulted in a decrease in the Imaxsuccinate and an increase in the K0.5succinate. At −50 mV, for example, the Imaxsuccinatewas −280 nA in the absence of Li+ and −200 nA in the presence of Li+ (Fig. 7 A). There was a much larger effect of Li+ on the apparent affinity for succinate; the K0.5succinate(−50 mV) increased from 180 to 750 μm after the addition of 5 mm Li+ (Fig. 7 B). The inhibition of succinate-induced currents by millimolar concentrations of Li+ suggests that NaDC-1 has at least one cation binding site with a high affinity for Li+. Therefore, inhibition of succinate-induced currents by increasing concentrations of Li+ was measured at saturating succinate and Na+ concentrations (10 mmsuccinate and 100 mm Na+). Li+caused a concentration dependent inhibition of succinate-induced currents, which was slightly more pronounced at more positive membrane potentials, 54% maximal inhibition at −150 mV compared with 76% maximal inhibition at −10 mV (Fig. 8). The apparent K i for lithium was slightly larger at more negative membrane potentials, around 4 mm at −150 mV and 2.9 mm at −50 mV (Fig. 8). The apparent Hill coefficient was ≤1 at all membrane potentials tested and insensitive to voltage (not shown). The overexpression of NaDC-1 in Xenopus oocytes has provided a means of characterizing its electrophysiological properties. In oocytes expressing NaDC-1, the presence of substrate induced inward currents that were dependent on the concentrations of substrate and sodium, and on the membrane potential. Although Na+ is the preferred cation, Li+ can also support transport in NaDC-1. However, the poor activation of transport by Li+ produces inhibition when Na+ is present. In many respects, the electrophysiological characteristics of substrate-induced currents in NaDC-1 resemble those of transporters of neutral substrates, including the Na+/glucose cotransporter, SGLT1 (15Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The apparent affinity constants for succinate in NaDC-1 measured under voltage-clamp conditions agree well with those obtained from radiotracer uptake studies in oocytes. The K m for succinate transport in NaDC-1 is around 0.5 mm (5Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1093-F1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the K0.5succinate for succinate-induced currents was approximately 0.2 mm at −50 mV. Although there was a marked effect of voltage on K0.5succinate at more positive membrane potentials, the K0.5succinate at negative membrane potentials was relatively insensitive to voltage, indicating voltage independence of succinate binding. This result was somewhat surprising considering that succinate is transported as a divalent anion. However, similar results have been reported for other sodium-coupled transporters, irrespective of substrate charge, including the Na+/glucose cotransporter, SGLT1 (15Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the Na+/I− cotransporter, NIS (17Eskandari S. Loo D.D.F. Dai G. Levy O. Wright E.M. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27230-27238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and the Na+/phosphate cotransporter, NaPi-5 (18Forster I.C. Wagner C.A. Busch A.E. Lang F. Biber J. Hernando N. Murer H. Werner A. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This voltage independence of substrate binding may be a general feature of some sodium-coupled transporters and suggests that the substrate binding site does not sense the electric field. The steep voltage dependence at depolarizing potentials could be a consequence of voltage-dependent steps in Na+ binding. In contrast, the Na+/Cl−/γ-aminobutyric acid transporter, GAT-1, and Na+/glutamate transporter, HEAAC1, exhibit increases in K 0.5 with more negative membrane potentials (19Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 20Kanai Y. Steltzner M. Nussberger S. Khawaja S. Hebert S.C. Smith C.P. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20599-20606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that the substrate binding site senses membrane potential in this group of anion transporters. The stimulation of I max with more negative membrane potentials is seen in all of the sodium-coupled transporters studied to date, including NaDC-1 (15Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 17Eskandari S. Loo D.D.F. Dai G. Levy O. Wright E.M. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27230-27238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 20Kanai Y. Steltzner M. Nussberger S. Khawaja S. Hebert S.C. Smith C.P. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20599-20606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that voltage-dependent steps in substrate turnover are a general property of sodium-coupled transporters. The effects of voltage on sodium binding in NaDC-1 were more pronounced than on substrate binding. The K0.5Na+ decreased by 50% between −50 and −150 mV. As suggested for other sodium-coupled transporters, this effect of voltage on sodium binding supports an “ion-well” hypothesis (15Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Activation by cations in NaDC-1 is also affected by voltage since the ImaxNa+ from sodium activation experiments increased with more negative membrane potentials. The apparent Hill coefficient in NaDC-1 was unaffected by changes in membrane potential. Therefore, the voltage sensitivity of Na+ binding and translocation in NaDC-1 also resembles the members of the SGLT family (15Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 17Eskandari S. Loo D.D.F. Dai G. Levy O. Wright E.M. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27230-27238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 21Hager K.M. Hazama A. Kwon H.M. Loo D.D.F. Handler J.S. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ImaxNa+ of the Na+/Cl−/γ-aminobutyric acid transporter is independent of voltage (19Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The results of the experiments presented here support the model of NaDC-1 stoichiometry in which 3 Na+ ions are coupled to 1 divalent anion substrate. The Hill coefficient provides an estimate of the minimum number of cations involved in transport, assuming cooperativity of cation binding (22Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). Based on the Hill coefficient of about 2.4 in this study, the minimum number of strongly cooperative sodium binding sites in NaDC-1 is 3, which agrees with results using brush border membrane vesicles (10Hirayama B. Wright E.M. Pflugers Arch. 1986; 407: S174-S179Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). NaDC-1 has a relatively broad substrate specificity and the preferred substrates are di- and tricarboxylic acids. Based on effects of pH on citrate transport, but a lack of pH effect on succinate transport, it is thought that NaDC-1 carries predominantly divalent anion substrates (11Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1093-F1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wright S.H. Kippen I. Wright E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 684: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This model is supported by the results of these studies in which inward currents were measured in the presence of tricarboxylic acids. If the transported species were trivalent anions, there should be no measurable currents unless the coupling stoichiometry is greater than 3 Na+:1 substrate. Overall, the magnitude of the substrate-dependent currents in NaDC-1 agrees well with uptake studies in oocytes and in native membranes (5Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1093-F1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The largest currents were seen with methylsuccinate and citrate. Since the substrate concentration used in these experiments was 10 mm, the currents probably represent theI max for many of the substrates tested. In transport experiments, the K m for citrate in NaDC-1 expressed in oocytes was 0.9 mm (11Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1093-F1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the rate of substrate turnover of methylsuccinate and citrate is probably faster than that of succinate. The presence of sulfate produced small inward currents, approximately 5% of the currents generated by succinate. NaDC-1 and NaSi-1 belong to the same gene family and have 43% sequence identity (5Pajor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5779-5785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Markovich D. Forgo J. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8073-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, the two transporters had no overlaps in substrate selectivity (24Pajor A.M. Sun N. Bai L. Markovich D. Sule P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1370: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, under voltage-clamp conditions, NaDC-1 and NaSi-1 may have some shared substrates that are carried with low affinity or slow substrate turnover. The preferred cation carried by NaDC-1 is Na+. Unlike other sodium-coupled transporters, such as the Na+/glucose cotransporter (25Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2110-2115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and the Na+/Cl−/serotonin cotransporter (26Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2257-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), protons are not effective activators of succinate transport in NaDC-1. However, Li+ can substitute for Na+ to produce substrate-dependent currents, which also indicates that the stoichiometry of Li+-dependent succinate transport is likely to be 3:1. Li+ is a poor activator of succinate transport, most likely because binding of Li+ to NaDC-1 produces a less favorable conformation for substrate binding compared with binding of Na+. The apparent substrate affinity in NaDC-1 is about 15-fold lower in lithium ( K0.5succinate 3 mm) compared with sodium ( K0.5succinate 0.2 mm), consistent with the idea that cations are essential activators of transport by producing an increased affinity for substrate. The exact conformational change produced by cation binding is determined by the identity of the cation. The steep voltage dependence of Imaxsuccinate in Li+ suggests that hyperpolarizing membrane potentials have a greater effect on one or more steps in the transport cycle in the presence of Li+ compared with Na+. Lithium also acts as a potent inhibitor of succinate transport by NaDC-1 when Na+ is present, with an apparentK i of 2 mm (3Wright E.M. Wright S.H. Hirayama B.A. Kippen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7514-7517Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1093-F1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans and rodents, treatment with Li+ leads to rapid increases in urinary concentrations of Krebs cycle intermediates (4Bond P.A. Jenner F.A. Lee C.R. Lenton E. Pollitt R.J. Sampson G.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1972; 46: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Bond P.A. Jenner F.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1974; 50: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, Li+ behaved as a mixed-type inhibitor of NaDC-1. Succinate-dependent currents in NaDC-1 were inhibited by millimolar concentrations of Li+, with a decrease in Imaxsuccinate and an increase in K0.5succinate. Mixed-type inhibition is characterized by a combination of competitive inhibition, which would be seen as an increased K0.5succinate due to the mutual exclusion of substrate and inhibitor (i.e. Na+and Li+), and noncompetitive inhibition, which would be seen as a decrease in Imaxsuccinate due to the production of an inactive intermediate (22Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). The proportional change in K0.5succinate is much greater than the change in Imaxsuccinate, in the voltage range used in our studies. The smaller effect on Imaxsuccinate could explain why studies with brush border membrane vesicles reported an increase inK m for succinate in the presence of 2 mmLi+ but no significant effect onV max (3Wright E.M. Wright S.H. Hirayama B.A. Kippen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7514-7517Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of Li+ on NaDC-1 occur at relatively low concentrations, even in the presence of saturating Na+concentrations, which confirms previous suggestions that at least one of the cation binding sites in NaDC-1 has a high affinity for Li+ (3Wright E.M. Wright S.H. Hirayama B.A. Kippen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7514-7517Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The hyperbolic kinetics of inhibition by Li+ are also consistent with one cation binding site which has a higher affinity for Li+. This result shows that the multiple sodium binding sites in NaDC-1 are not identical. The apparent lithium K i of 2.5 mm seen at −10 mV is similar to the K i measured in transport experiments in oocytes (11Pajor A.M. Sun N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1093-F1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One difference between NaDC-1 and other Na+-coupled transporters is the difficulty in measuring pre-steady state charge movements in response to voltage jumps. Although pre-steady state currents were observed in oocytes expressing NaDC-1, it was only possible to measure them in oocytes exhibiting high transport expression. The fast time constants, close to the limit of resolution of the two-electrode voltage clamp, and the lack of saturation of charge movements in the voltage range used in our studies made it difficult to obtain reliable fits of the data to the Boltzmann equation in order to estimate Q max. Interestingly, the properties of the charge movements in NaDC-1 appear to resemble those seen in the unrelated Na+/phosphate cotransporter, NaPi-5 (18Forster I.C. Wagner C.A. Busch A.E. Lang F.

The maximum time constant, τmax, in NaPi-5 is around 5 ms, compared with time constants between 9 and 150 ms in other sodium-dependent transporters (28Hazama A. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Pre-steady state charge movements are thought to represent movement of the transporter in response to changes in the electric field, probably representing reorientation of charges or dipoles in the protein or binding and release of Na+ (28Hazama A. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). If either of these steps is rate-limiting in NaDC-1, the rapid pre-steady state charge movements could indicate that the turnover number will be relatively high, although this remains to be tested. In conclusion, NaDC-1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes generates substrate-induced currents that are dependent on concentrations of substrate, sodium, and membrane potential. Although NaDC-1 belongs to a distinct gene family, in some respects it behaves very much like other Na+-coupled transporters, including the Na+/glucose cotransporter (15Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the Na+/I− cotransporter (17Eskandari S. Loo D.D.F. Dai G. Levy O. Wright E.M. Carrasco N. J.

Hernando N. Murer H. Werner A. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cation selectivity of NaDC-1 is unique, however, with a single high affinity binding site for lithium that, when occupied, results in transport inhibition. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of transport by NaDC-1 and should allow us to design models of NaDC-1 function. We are indebted to Dr. Ernest Wright for the generous use of his electrophysiology equipment during the early portions of this study and for critical review of this manuscript. We also thank Ning Sun for preparation and injection of oocytes and Dr. Lucie Parent for the initial pilot experiments demonstrating that NaDC-1 is electrogenic."

The minimal domain with proteolytic activity resides in the N terminus, where a structural tetradentate zinc binding site is located. The ligands being been identified by x-ray crystallography as being three cysteines (Cys 97 , Cys 99 , and Cys 145 ) and one histidine residue (His 149 ), which is postulated to coordinate the metal through a water molecule. In this article, we present an analysis of the role of metal coordination with respect to enzyme activity and folding. Using NMR spectroscopy, the resonances of His 149 were assigned based on their isotropic shift in a Co(II)-substituted protein. Data obtained with 15 N-labeled NS3 protease were compatible with the involvement of the d-N of His 149 in metal coordination. pH titration experiments showed that the cooperative association of at least two protons is required in the protonation process of His 149 . Changes in the NMR signals of this residue between pH 7 and 5 are interpreted as evidence for a structural change at the metal binding site, which switches from a “closed” to an “open” conformation. Site-directed mutagenesis of His 149 has shown the importance of this residue in the metal incorporation pathway and for achieving an active fold. The metal coordination of the protease was also investigated by circular dichroism and electronic absorption spectroscopies using a Co(II)-substituted enzyme. We show evidence for rearrangements of the metal coordination geometry induced by complex formation with an NS4A peptide cofactor. No such changes were observed upon binding to a substrate peptide. Also, CN 2 and N3 induced Co(II) ligand field perturbations, which went along with an 1.5-fold enhancement of protease activity."

Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics for helicase activity were monitored by the fluorescence changes associated with strand separation of F21:HF31 that was formed from a 5′-hexachlorofluorescein-tagged 31-mer (HF31) and a complementary 3′-fluorescein-tagged 21-mer (F21).k cat for this reaction was 0.12 s−1. The fluorescence change associated with strand separation of F21:HF31 by excess enzyme and ATP was a biphasic process. The time course of the early phase (duplex unwinding) suggested only a few base pairs (∼2) were disrupted concertedly. The maximal value of the rate constant (k eff) describing the late phase of the reaction (strand separation) was 0.5 s−1, which was 4-fold greater than k cat. Release of HF31 from E·HF31 in the presence of ATP (0.21 s−1) was the major contributor tok cat.

Because approximately 1% of the population is infected with HCV and available therapies are effective for only a small subpopulation of these patients, an urgent medical need exists for an effective anti-HCV agent (15Choo Q.-L.

Consequently, HCV helicase is an attractive target for development of an antiviral agent for HCV.The NS3 protein of HCV has at least two enzymatic activities necessary for viral replication. The N-terminal 20 kDa of NS3 is a serine proteinase that cleaves the HCV-encoded polyprotein at four specific positions (18Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J.

Herein, we extend our understanding of the kinetic mechanism of the helicase activity of this protein by analysis of the strand separation reaction with fluorescently tagged duplex oligomers of defined sequences. The results with HCV helicase were consistent with a passive kinetic mechanism for DNA strand separation in which dissociation of single-stranded DNA was the major contributor tok cat.DISCUSSIONCrystal structures for helicases from Bacillus stearothermophilus (36Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), HCV (37Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and E. coli (38Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) in the absence of divalent metal ion indicated that they were monomeric in the crystalline state. However, many helicases, such as E. coli Rep helicase (4Chao K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1165-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), T4 helicase (32Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and DnaB helicase (39Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), appear to be oligomeric in the presence of substrates. In contrast to these helicases, HCV helicase was a monomeric protein in the presence of DNA and/or ATP analogues. Because HCV helicase contains a single DNA-binding site per monomer (22Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), these results indicated that the active form of this enzyme had a single DNA-binding site. Helicases have been proposed to unwind duplex nucleic acids by either an “active” or “passive” mechanism (7Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The former mechanism requires that the catalytically active form of the enzyme has multiple nucleic acid-binding sites. Our finding that the active form of HCV helicase was monomeric with a single nucleic acid-binding site suggested that HCV catalyzed the unwinding of F21:HF31 by a passive mechanism.The goal of the present study was to identify the kinetic steps that contributed to k cat. Unfortunately, relating pre-steady-state data to the steady-state k catwas complicated by the processivity of the enzyme, by the step size, and by the number of base pairs broken for each ATP consumed. For helicases, a simplified scheme describing the unwinding of duplex DNA ((bp)n) bound to the enzyme is given by Equation 12. E·(bp)n→kE·(bp)n−(n/m)→kE·(bp)n−(2n/m)→k→kE·(bp)0↓k′↓k′↓k′↓k′Equation 12 In this simplified mechanism, the unwinding of double-stranded DNA with n base pairs (bp) was considered to occur sequentially in n/m steps with each unwinding event described by the pseudo first-order rate constant (k) that could be dependent on ATP concentration. Furthermore, each partially unwound duplex could dissociate from the enzyme and anneal in a process described by the rate constant k′. This model is analogous to that described by Ali and Lohman for E. coli helicase II (14Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The processivity of the enzyme for DNA (P) in this model is given by Equation 13. The fraction of double-stranded DNA that was separated into single-stranded DNA by HCV helicase in a single binding event is given by Equation 14. P=kk+k′Equation 13 fractional DNA unwound=kk+k′nmEquation 14 An explicit expression for the time courses of strand separation has been derived for the simple model of Equation 12 (14Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In this model, the reaction was initiated by addition of ATP and competitor DNA to E·(bp)n. Competitor DNA ensured that partially unwound (bp)n that dissociated from the enzyme annealed and did not rebind to the enzyme. The time course for strand separation of (bp)n (f(t)) is given by Equation 15. f(t)=Pnm1−∑s=0nm((k+k′)t)se−(k+k′)ts!Equation 15 The assumptions for this derivation corresponded to experimental conditions for the data of Fig. 5 where a competitor DNA was present to trap free enzyme as F21:HF31 or products dissociated from the enzyme. Numerical simulation of the time courses for strand separation of a 24-mer were made with step sizes equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. A 24-mer was chosen over a 21-mer for these simulations because of the greater number of possible step sizes evenly divisible into 24. The simulated time courses for strand separation were biphasic in all cases except for a step size of 24 base pairs. The initial phase of the reaction using small step sizes was approximately linearly dependent on time, and the late phase of the reaction was exponentially dependent on time. The lag time for the reaction (the time defined by the intersection of the line through the lag phase data and the line drawn with the maximal slope through the exponential phase data (t l in Fig. 5)) was directly proportional to the number of steps. More importantly, the time for transition from the linear phase to the exponential phase (the portion oft l that the time course had definite curvature,t t in Fig. 5) was a decreasing fraction of the lag time of the reaction. For example, the transition from the linear phase to the exponential phase for the simulated data was 26, 46, and 62% of the lag time for step sizes of 1, 2, and 3 base pairs, respectively. The transition from the linear phase to the exponential phase for unwinding F21:HF31 and 21:HF31 (Fig. 5 and Fig. 7) was very abrupt (∼25% of the total lag time). Based on the simple model above, these results suggested that HCV helicase disrupted F21:HF31 at most several base pairs at a time. Because the free energy of hydrolysis of ATP is sufficient to break 2 to 4 base pairs (2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 7Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Roman L.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2863-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), it was not unreasonable to propose a step size of 2. This would result in the efficiency for coupling the energy of ATP hydrolysis to base pair breaking of over 50%. For a step size of 2 base pairs, a lag time of approximately 1 s (average value from the data of Fig. 5 and 6), and a duplex of 21 base pairs (F21:HF31), the value for the sum ofk and k′ in Equation 12 was estimated from the simulations described above to be approximately 7.5 s−1. From the value for the sum of k and k′ (7.5 s−1), the step size (m = 2), the fraction unwound (0.44), and Equation 14, the values of k andk′ were estimated to be 7.0 s−1 and 0.5 s−1, respectively. The calculated value for dissociation of F21:HF31 in various stages of unwinding fromE·ATP·F21:HF31 (k′ = 0.5 s−1) was in good agreement with the experimental measured value of 0.84 s−1 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the values for P, n/m, and k were used to predict the maximal value for the effective rate constant (k eff) for formation of F21 from E·ATP·F21:HF31 in the presence of a saturating concentration of enzyme (Fig. 6). The expression fork eff for conversion of (bp)n to (bp)0 derived for the model of Equation 12 with steady-state assumptions is given by Equation 16. keff≈(P−1)Pnm−1kPnm−1Equation 16 Substituting estimated values for n/m (∼11),k (7 s−1), and P (0.93) into this expression, the predicted value for k eff was 0.43 s−1, which was similar to the observed value of 0.50 s−1 (Fig. 6).Because the maximal value of the pseudo first-order rate constant for formation of F21 from F21:HF31 with excess E and ATP (0.5 s−1) was 4-fold larger than the value ofk cat (0.12 s−1), another step must contribute significantly to k cat. The dissociation rate constant of E·ATP·HF31 was 0.21 s−1, which was similar to k cat. If product dissociation and the unwinding step were the sole contributors to k cat, the calculated value ofk cat (0.15 s−1) was very close to the experimental value (0.12 s−1). Thus, the dissociation of E·HF31 was the major contributor tok cat for strand separation of F21:HF31 and the unwinding steps were minor contributors to k cat. The relevance of the interpretation of the kinetic results presented herein for F21:HF31 to normal substrate was dependent on the assumption that the tagged and untagged DNA substrates interacted similarly with the enzyme. The similarity of the selected kinetic parameters for interaction of the tagged and untagged DNA molecules with the enzyme (Table II) suggested that this assumption was valid. Helicases are ubiquitous enzymes required for cellular repair, recombination, and replication (1Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev.

Because approximately 1% of the population is infected with HCV and available therapies are effective for only a small subpopulation of these patients, an urgent medical need exists for an effective anti-HCV agent (15Choo Q.-L.

The NS3 protein of HCV has at least two enzymatic activities necessary for viral replication. The N-terminal 20 kDa of NS3 is a serine proteinase that cleaves the HCV-encoded polyprotein at four specific positions (18Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2832-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal 50 kDa of NS3 has NTPase (19Suzich J.A. Tamura J.K. Palmer-Hill F. Warrener P. Grakoui A. Rice C.M. Feinstone S.M.

The kinetic mechanism of the ATPase activity associated with this protein isolated from HCV genotype 1b, which is a major subtype found in both Japanese and American populations (21Bukh J. Purcell R.H. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), has been characterized in detail (22Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E.

Herein, we extend our understanding of the kinetic mechanism of the helicase activity of this protein by analysis of the strand separation reaction with fluorescently tagged duplex oligomers of defined sequences. The results with HCV helicase were consistent with a passive kinetic mechanism for DNA strand separation in which dissociation of single-stranded DNA was the major contributor tok cat. DISCUSSIONCrystal structures for helicases from Bacillus stearothermophilus (36Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B.

Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) in the absence of divalent metal ion indicated that they were monomeric in the crystalline state. However, many helicases, such as E. coli Rep helicase (4Chao K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1165-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), T4 helicase (32Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and DnaB helicase (39Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), appear to be oligomeric in the presence of substrates. In contrast to these helicases, HCV helicase was a monomeric protein in the presence of DNA and/or ATP analogues. Because HCV helicase contains a single DNA-binding site per monomer (22Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), these results indicated that the active form of this enzyme had a single DNA-binding site. Helicases have been proposed to unwind duplex nucleic acids by either an “active” or “passive” mechanism (7Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The former mechanism requires that the catalytically active form of the enzyme has multiple nucleic acid-binding sites. Our finding that the active form of HCV helicase was monomeric with a single nucleic acid-binding site suggested that HCV catalyzed the unwinding of F21:HF31 by a passive mechanism.The goal of the present study was to identify the kinetic steps that contributed to k cat. Unfortunately, relating pre-steady-state data to the steady-state k catwas complicated by the processivity of the enzyme, by the step size, and by the number of base pairs broken for each ATP consumed. For helicases, a simplified scheme describing the unwinding of duplex DNA ((bp)n) bound to the enzyme is given by Equation 12. E·(bp)n→kE·(bp)n−(n/m)→kE·(bp)n−(2n/m)→k→kE·(bp)0↓k′↓k′↓k′↓k′Equation 12 In this simplified mechanism, the unwinding of double-stranded DNA with n base pairs (bp) was considered to occur sequentially in n/m steps with each unwinding event described by the pseudo first-order rate constant (k) that could be dependent on ATP concentration. Furthermore, each partially unwound duplex could dissociate from the enzyme and anneal in a process described by the rate constant k′. This model is analogous to that described by Ali and Lohman for E. coli helicase II (14Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The processivity of the enzyme for DNA (P) in this model is given by Equation 13. The fraction of double-stranded DNA that was separated into single-stranded DNA by HCV helicase in a single binding event is given by Equation 14. P=kk+k′Equation 13 fractional DNA unwound=kk+k′nmEquation 14 An explicit expression for the time courses of strand separation has been derived for the simple model of Equation 12 (14Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In this model, the reaction was initiated by addition of ATP and competitor DNA to E·(bp)n. Competitor DNA ensured that partially unwound (bp)n that dissociated from the enzyme annealed and did not rebind to the enzyme. The time course for strand separation of (bp)n (f(t)) is given by Equation 15. f(t)=Pnm1−∑s=0nm((k+k′)t)se−(k+k′)ts!Equation 15 The assumptions for this derivation corresponded to experimental conditions for the data of Fig. 5 where a competitor DNA was present to trap free enzyme as F21:HF31 or products dissociated from the enzyme. Numerical simulation of the time courses for strand separation of a 24-mer were made with step sizes equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. A 24-mer was chosen over a 21-mer for these simulations because of the greater number of possible step sizes evenly divisible into 24. The simulated time courses for strand separation were biphasic in all cases except for a step size of 24 base pairs. The initial phase of the reaction using small step sizes was approximately linearly dependent on time, and the late phase of the reaction was exponentially dependent on time. The lag time for the reaction (the time defined by the intersection of the line through the lag phase data and the line drawn with the maximal slope through the exponential phase data (t l in Fig. 5)) was directly proportional to the number of steps. More importantly, the time for transition from the linear phase to the exponential phase (the portion oft l that the time course had definite curvature,t t in Fig. 5) was a decreasing fraction of the lag time of the reaction. For example, the transition from the linear phase to the exponential phase for the simulated data was 26, 46, and 62% of the lag time for step sizes of 1, 2, and 3 base pairs, respectively. The transition from the linear phase to the exponential phase for unwinding F21:HF31 and 21:HF31 (Fig. 5 and Fig. 7) was very abrupt (∼25% of the total lag time). Based on the simple model above, these results suggested that HCV helicase disrupted F21:HF31 at most several base pairs at a time. Because the free energy of hydrolysis of ATP is sufficient to break 2 to 4 base pairs (2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 7Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Roman L.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2863-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), it was not unreasonable to propose a step size of 2. This would result in the efficiency for coupling the energy of ATP hydrolysis to base pair breaking of over 50%. For a step size of 2 base pairs, a lag time of approximately 1 s (average value from the data of Fig. 5 and 6), and a duplex of 21 base pairs (F21:HF31), the value for the sum ofk and k′ in Equation 12 was estimated from the simulations described above to be approximately 7.5 s−1. From the value for the sum of k and k′ (7.5 s−1), the step size (m = 2), the fraction unwound (0.44), and Equation 14, the values of k andk′ were estimated to be 7.0 s−1 and 0.5 s−1, respectively. The calculated value for dissociation of F21:HF31 in various stages of unwinding fromE·ATP·F21:HF31 (k′ = 0.5 s−1) was in good agreement with the experimental measured value of 0.84 s−1 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the values for P, n/m, and k were used to predict the maximal value for the effective rate constant (k eff) for formation of F21 from E·ATP·F21:HF31 in the presence of a saturating concentration of enzyme (Fig. 6). The expression fork eff for conversion of (bp)n to (bp)0 derived for the model of Equation 12 with steady-state assumptions is given by Equation 16. keff≈(P−1)Pnm−1kPnm−1Equation 16 Substituting estimated values for n/m (∼11),k (7 s−1), and P (0.93) into this expression, the predicted value for k eff was 0.43 s−1, which was similar to the observed value of 0.50 s−1 (Fig. 6).Because the maximal value of the pseudo first-order rate constant for formation of F21 from F21:HF31 with excess E and ATP (0.5 s−1) was 4-fold larger than the value ofk cat (0.12 s−1), another step must contribute significantly to k cat. The dissociation rate constant of E·ATP·HF31 was 0.21 s−1, which was similar to k cat. If product dissociation and the unwinding step were the sole contributors to k cat, the calculated value ofk cat (0.15 s−1) was very close to the experimental value (0.12 s−1). Thus, the dissociation of E·HF31 was the major contributor tok cat for strand separation of F21:HF31 and the unwinding steps were minor contributors to k cat. The relevance of the interpretation of the kinetic results presented herein for F21:HF31 to normal substrate was dependent on the assumption that the tagged and untagged DNA substrates interacted similarly with the enzyme. The similarity of the selected kinetic parameters for interaction of the tagged and untagged DNA molecules with the enzyme (Table II) suggested that this assumption was valid.

https://openalex.org/W2102359581,"Ets transcription factors are important downstream targets of oncogenic Ras. The transcriptional activity of several Ets family members is regulated by Ras, and interfering with Ets-dependent transcription by expression of just the Ets2 DNA binding domain can inhibit or reverse Ras-mediated cellular transformation. To better understand the role of Ets proteins in Ras transformation, we have now analyzed the effects of stably expressing a variety of Ets2 constructs in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 (DT) cells. Expression of only the Ets2 transactivation domains, which also inhibits Ras or Neu/ErbB-2-mediated activation of Ets-dependent transcription, strongly inhibited anchorage-independent growth, but did not revert the transformed DT cell morphology. Unexpectedly, high expression of full-length Ets2, a transcriptional activator, broadly reversed the transformed properties of DT cells, including anchorage-independent growth, transformed morphology, and tumorigenicity, but did not impair attached cell growth. Increasing full-length Ets2 transcriptional activity by fusing it to the VP16 transactivation domain enhanced its ability to reverse DT cell transformation. Mutational analysis revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation site required for Ras-mediated activation, Ets2(T72), was not essential for Ets2 reversion activity. The distinct reversion activities of the highly expressed Ets2 transactivation domains or full-length Ets2, along with the specific reversion activity by Ets2 constructs that either inhibit or activate Ets-dependent transcription, suggests multiple roles for Ets factors in cellular transformation. These results indicate that several distinct approaches for modulating Ets activity may be useful for intervention in human cancers. Ets transcription factors are important downstream targets of oncogenic Ras. The transcriptional activity of several Ets family members is regulated by Ras, and interfering with Ets-dependent transcription by expression of just the Ets2 DNA binding domain can inhibit or reverse Ras-mediated cellular transformation. To better understand the role of Ets proteins in Ras transformation, we have now analyzed the effects of stably expressing a variety of Ets2 constructs in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 (DT) cells. Expression of only the Ets2 transactivation domains, which also inhibits Ras or Neu/ErbB-2-mediated activation of Ets-dependent transcription, strongly inhibited anchorage-independent growth, but did not revert the transformed DT cell morphology. Unexpectedly, high expression of full-length Ets2, a transcriptional activator, broadly reversed the transformed properties of DT cells, including anchorage-independent growth, transformed morphology, and tumorigenicity, but did not impair attached cell growth. Increasing full-length Ets2 transcriptional activity by fusing it to the VP16 transactivation domain enhanced its ability to reverse DT cell transformation. Mutational analysis revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation site required for Ras-mediated activation, Ets2(T72), was not essential for Ets2 reversion activity. The distinct reversion activities of the highly expressed Ets2 transactivation domains or full-length Ets2, along with the specific reversion activity by Ets2 constructs that either inhibit or activate Ets-dependent transcription, suggests multiple roles for Ets factors in cellular transformation. These results indicate that several distinct approaches for modulating Ets activity may be useful for intervention in human cancers. Ets2 is one of the founding members of the Ets transcription factor family, which are characterized by a conserved DNA binding motif called the ETS domain (1Karim F.D. Urness L.D. Thummel C.S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Gunther C.V. Nye J.A. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1451-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). There are now over 30 known members of the Ets family, found in species ranging from humans toCaenorhabditis elegans (2Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogenes as Transcriptional Regulators, Vol. 1: Retroviral Oncogenes. Birkäuser, Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 29-88Google Scholar). The mouse and human Ets2 genes were initially identified through extended similarity to chicken v-ets (3Watson D.K. McWilliams M.J. Lapis P. Lautenberger J.A. Schweinfest C.W. Papas T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7862-7866Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 4Boulukos K.E. Pognonec P. Begue A. Galibert F. Gesquiere J.C. Stehelin D. Ghysdael J.

Papas T.S. Seth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). One evolutionarily conserved role of many Ets proteins is their function as downstream mediators of the Ras signal transduction pathway. TheDrosophila Ets proteins Pointed P2, a transcriptional activator, and Yan, a transcriptional repressor, are targets of Ras signaling (6O'Neill E.M. Rebay I. Tjian R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 137-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 7Brunner D. Ducker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klambt C.

Ets2 and several other mammalian Ets proteins contain a region of homology with Drosophila Pointed P2 distinct from the Ets domain, called the Pointed domain (9Klambt C. Development. 1993; 117: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). Ras-mediated signaling through Pointed P2 requires a threonine residue within a MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase; TAD, transactivation domains; DBD, DNA binding domain; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IRES, internal ribosome entry site. kinase recognition site in the Pointed domain (6O'Neill E.M.

Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). A corresponding MAP kinase recognition sequence is also found in the Ets2 pointed domain. We previously showed that phosphorylation of this corresponding Ets2 (T72) residue is essential for Ras- or Neu/ErbB-2-mediated activation of Ets2 transactivation activity (10Yang B.S. Hauser C.A.

Solski P.A. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Neznanov N.N. Oshima R.G. Hauser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7992-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and that Ras signaling to Ets2 takes place through the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway (12McCarthy S.A. Chen D. Yang B.-S. Garcı́a-Ramı́rez J.J. Cherwinski H. Chen X-R. Klagsbrun M.L. Hauser C.A. Ostrowski M.C. McMahon M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that not only are Ets proteins targets of Ras signaling, but that Ets factors play an important role in mediating cellular transformation. Initial characterization of several oncogene-responsive promoter elements revealed that adjacent Ets and AP-1 binding sites mediate their oncogene responsiveness, and that both the Ets and AP-1 binding sites are essential for induction by the activated non-nuclear oncogenes (13Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14Wasylyk C. Flores P. Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3371-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Similar elements have since been found in the promoters of many genes, and where it has been tested, Ets2 can cooperate with AP-1 family members and Ras to activate their transcription. The products of these Ras-induced genes have a wide spectrum of functions, including roles in cellular metabolism, growth control, and metastasis (15Bortner D.M. Langer S.J. Ostrowski M.C. Crit. Rev. Oncogen. 1993; 4: 137-160PubMed Google Scholar, 16Aoyama A. Klemenz R. Crit. Rev. Oncogen. 1993; 4: 53-94PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chambers A.F. Tuck A.B. Crit. Rev. Oncogen. 1993; 4: 95-114PubMed Google Scholar). There is a good correlation between the ability of various non-nuclear oncogenes to activate the transcription of reporter genes containing adjacent Ets and AP-1 binding sites, and their ability to transform rodent fibroblasts (2Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogenes as Transcriptional Regulators, Vol. 1: Retroviral Oncogenes. Birkäuser, Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 29-88Google Scholar,14Wasylyk C. Flores P. Gutman A.

Although Ets binding sites in oncogene-responsive promoter elements are often found adjacent to binding sites for the Ras activated AP-1 family of transcription factors, Ets2 is a distinct target of Ras signaling. We previously showed that two adjacent Ets2 consensus binding sites, similar to those found in the stromelysin promoter (13Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), are sufficient to confer both Ets2 and Ras responsiveness to a minimal promoter (10Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 19Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar). Despite initial reports indicating that high level expression of Ets1 or Ets2 in NIH3T3 cells could give rise to infrequent transformed colonies (20Seth A. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1761-1767PubMed Google Scholar, 21Seth A. Watson D.K. Blair D.G. Papas T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7833-7837Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), there has been little subsequent evidence to suggest that simply increasing the amount of Ets1 or Ets2 proteins is sufficient for cellular transformation. However, the necessary role of Ets proteins in fibroblast transformation has been revealed by inhibition experiments, where expression of the Ets2 DNA binding domain alone was found to inhibit oncogenic Ras- or Neu-mediated cellular transformation (11Galang C.K. Garcia-Ramirez J. Solski P.A. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Neznanov N.N. Oshima R.G. Hauser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7992-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,22Langer S.J. Bortner D.M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, expression of the Ets1, Ets2, or PU.1 DNA binding domains was shown to reverse the transformed phenotype of stably Ras-transformed fibroblasts (23Wasylyk C. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the expression of these presumptive dominant inhibitory Ets mutants did not impair normal cell growth in these studies, suggesting that altering Ets activity may be an approach to specifically reverse the transformed phenotype. Because Ets family proteins bind to similar DNA sequences centered about a conserved GGAA/T core (2Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogenes as Transcriptional Regulators, Vol. 1: Retroviral Oncogenes. Birkäuser, Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 29-88Google Scholar), it is likely that high level expression of the ETS domain from Ets2 inhibits the binding and function of many members of the Ets family. This idea was supported by the finding that expression of the ETS domain of either of two of the most divergent Ets family members, Ets1 or PU.1, could reverse Ras transformation (23Wasylyk C. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, studies utilizing high expression of ETS domains do not identify which individual Ets family members are actually important in cellular transformation. In addition, although most Ets factors are associated with transcriptional activation (2Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Yaniv M. Ghysdael J. Oncogenes as Transcriptional Regulators, Vol. 1: Retroviral Oncogenes. Birkäuser, Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 29-88Google Scholar), several widely expressed Ets proteins including ERF, SAP2/NET, and TEL have been reported to be negative regulators of transcription (24Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Giovane A. Sobieszczuk P. Ayadi A. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5667-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Wang L.C. Kuo F. Fujiwara Y. Gilliland D.G. Golub T.R. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4374-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the dominant inhibitory mutants do not inhibit transformation by blocking Ets-dependent transcriptional activation, but instead may be overcoming transcription inhibition by Ets family repressors. To further analyze the role of Ets proteins in cellular transformation, we have generated a number of Ets2 expression constructs, which can inhibit or activate Ets-dependent transcription, and tested their ability to reverse several criteria of the transformed phenotype when stably expressed in Ras-transformed mouse fibroblasts. To more specifically target Ets2, which is expressed in the Ras-transformed DT cells used in this analysis (27Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we have used an expression construct for the Ets2 transactivation domains without the ETS domain. We previously showed that expression of the Ets2 transactivation domains inhibits activation of Ets-dependent transcription by either oncogenic Ras or Neu/ErbB-2 (11Galang C.K. Garcia-Ramirez J. Solski P.A. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Neznanov N.N. Oshima R.G. Hauser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7992-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This Ets2 construct contains extensive homology only with Ets1, as well as more limited homology with other members of the Pointed domain subfamily of Ets proteins. We show here that expression of either the Ets2 DNA binding domain or the Ets2 transactivation domains can inhibit Ras-mediated anchorage-independent growth, but these two constructs do not behave identically in reversing other features of the transformed phenotype. Somewhat unexpectedly, we also found that elevated expression of full-length Ets2 phenotypically reverts DT cell transformation, and that expression of a construct that artificially increases the transactivation activity of full-length Ets2 is even more efficient in reversing the Ras-transformed phenotype. The DT cell line is a Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cell line originally transformed by integration of two separate copies of the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus carrying the v-Ki-Ras gene (28Noda M. Selinger Z. Scolnick E.M. Bassin R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5602-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The DT cells were kindly provided by Dr. Y. S. Cho-Chung (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health). DT cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and NIH 3T3 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Stable DT cell lines were generated by transfection using the calcium phosphate precipitation method we previously described (56Hauser C.A. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), except that, for a 60-mm dish, 3 μg of pCIN-derived expression plasmid DNA and 12 μg of high molecular weight herring sperm carrier DNA were used. Stable colonies were selected 3 days after transfection using medium containing 400 μg/ml active G418 (Calbiochem). Multiple isolated DT cell clones derived from each expression plasmid were randomly picked, then expanded and passaged in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 for subsequent analysis. The pCIN4 mammalian expression vector used for all of the constructs is a derivative of the pCIN plasmid (30Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and was kindly provided by Steve Rees (Glaxo Wellcome). This vector is based on pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and utilizes the CMV enhancer/promoter to express an inserted coding sequence, which is linked by a viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. We have previously described the construction of pcDNA3-based mouse Ets2 expression constructs (FN-Ets2) for full-length wild type Ets2(T72), Ets2(A72), Ets2TAD, Ets2DBD, and the empty FNpcDNA3 (11Galang C.K. Garcia-Ramirez J. Solski P.A. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Neznanov N.N. Oshima R.G. Hauser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7992-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These constructs all include the FN sequence, a 20-residue N-terminal sequence containing the FLAG epitope tag followed by an SV40 nuclear localization signal. The FN sequence was found not to alter the activity of full-length Ets2 (11Galang C.K. Garcia-Ramirez J. Solski P.A. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Neznanov N.N. Oshima R.G. Hauser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7992-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To generate the pCIN-Ets2 expression constructs, we exchanged the CMV enhancer/promoter and FN-Ets2 coding sequences contained in an NruI-NotI fragment of the FN Ets2 constructs, with the NruI-NotI fragment containing the pCIN4 CMV enhancer/promoter up to theNotI site in the pCIN4 polylinker. The resulting pCIN-Ets2 constructs (from 5′ to 3′) contained a consensus translational start, the FLAG and SV40 NLS sequences fused to the Ets2 coding sequences, a splice site, an IRES, the neomycin phosphotransferase gene, and a poly(A) signal. The VP-16-containing constructs were generated using standard polymerase chain reaction methods to insert VP16 residues 410–479 in-frame as a BamHI-BglII fragment into the BamHI site at the junction of the FLAG/NLS and the Ets2 coding sequences in FN-Ets2, or into the BamHI site of empty FNpCDNA3 vector. These sequences were then transferred to pCIN4 as described above. The reporter plasmid Δ56FosdE-luc is the same as the modified minimalfos promoter-containing Δ56FosdE-CAT reporter we previously described (19Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar), except that the coding sequence of CAT was replaced by that of luciferase. The CAT coding sequence of Δ56 FosdE-CAT was removed by digestion withNaeI+EcoRI and replaced with aHindIII-SmaI fragment containing the luciferase coding sequence from LΔ5′pJD204 (57de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Both the vector (EcoRI) and insert (HindIII) sites were blunted prior to ligation. Similarly, the E.18-luc and Py2-luc reporters were constructed as described previously (10Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), except that the E.18pal oligonucleotide (two adjacent Ets2 binding sites in inverted orientation) or two copies of the Py oligonucleotide (the adjacent Ets and AP-1 binding sites from the polyoma enhancer) were inserted into Δ56FosdE-luc instead of Δ56FosdE-CAT. Soft agar assays were essentially performed as described previously (31Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Either 500 or 1000 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes in 1.5 ml of medium containing 0.33% agar, which was overlaid onto 7 ml of solidified medium containing 0.5% agar. The medium used for soft agar assays was DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum, and did not contain G418. The soft agar plates were fed with 0.5 ml of medium every 5–7 days, and after 14 days, the cells were stained overnight (at 37° and 5% CO2) with the vital dye p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet, and then counted. The p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Sigma) was prepared as a 10 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol, then diluted with PBS to 1 mg/ml, and 0.5 ml of this diluted solution was added to each dish. In parallel to each soft agar assay, an attached growth assay was performed, where 100 cells from the same cell dilutions were plated on standard tissue culture dishes and grown for 7 days. The resulting attached colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted. The number of soft agar colonies for each cell line was then normalized by multiplying by the ratio (attached colonies from DT cells)/(attached colonies from the cell line) in the same experiment. Actin filaments were visualized by growing the cells on glass coverslips and staining the cells with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. The FLAG epitope-tagged Ets2 proteins and the Ras proteins were detected in immunoblots using the anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.), and the pan-Ras AB-4 (Calbiochem), respectively. Primary antibody binding was visualized using the Phototope-HRP Western blot detection kit (New England BioLabs) and BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Transfection and reporter gene assays were performed as we described previously (58Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In brief, 12-well dishes of 50% confluent DT cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method, using 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.25 μg of pCIN4-derived Ets2 expression constructs, and 5 μg of sheared herring testis carrier DNA for each well. Sixteen hours following transfection, the growth medium was replaced with medium containing 0.5% calf serum, and the cells were incubated for an additional 28 h before harvest. Luciferase activity was quantitated using a Berthold Microlumat LB 96P luminometer. Transfection efficiency and nonspecific effects were controlled as we described (58Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), by analyzing multiple replicates (standard deviations are shown), and by demonstrating lack of effect in parallel on Δ56FosdE-luc, a non-Ets-dependent reporter. The immune complex MAP kinase assays were performed essentially as described (59Reuter C.W. Catling A.D. Weber M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), using 50 μg of total cell extract protein and the ERK1 C-16-G antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The precipitated MAPK bound to this antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incubated with buffer containing [γ32P]ATP and 10 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma). The entire reaction mix was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and radiolabeled myelin basic protein was detected by autoradiography and quantitated using a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). RNase protection assays were performed as described (60Neznanov N.S. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and a probe for the L32 ribosomal protein L32 mRNA was included as an internal standard as described (61Neznanov N.S. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27549-27557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Ets2 RNase protection probe was generated by SP6 RNA polymerase transcription of the NdeI-cut FN-Ets2(1–100) construct, which contains the FLAG/NLS coding sequences fused to the Ets2 coding sequence from amino acids 1–100. This 800-base probe protects 300 bases of the endogenous Ets2 message and 416 bases of the introduced FN-Ets2 message. Stable cell lines grown under G418 selection were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and counted using a hemocytometer. Then, 5 × 105 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS were subcutaneously injected into both the right and left dorsal flanks of 4-week-old nude mice. At 2-day intervals, the tumors were measured externally by caliper, and the average of the tumor length and width was estimated to be the tumor diameter, d. No tumors were detected on day 2. The approximate tumor volume was calculated using the formula V = (π/6) (d)3. For each cell line, 6–8 tumors were generated (in both flanks of 3–4 mice) and measured over the indicated time. The average tumor volume (in mm3) was then calculated. The statistical analysis of tumor growth was performed by comparing the individual volumes of the 6–8 tumors derived from each cell line relative to that of tumors from DT cells containing the empty expression vector pCIN#5, using a two-tailed, unpaired t test. The findings that high expression of the Ets2 DNA binding domain can block oncogene-mediated cellular transformation (11Galang C.K. Garcia-Ramirez J. Solski P.A. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Neznanov N.N. Oshima R.G. Hauser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7992-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Langer S.J. Bortner D.M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can also reverse the transformed phenotype of Ras-transformed fibroblasts (23Wasylyk C. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that Ets protein function is important in cellular transformation. To better characterize the role of Ets proteins in Ras-mediated cellular transformation, a variety of Ets2 expression constructs were generated, including expression constructs for full-length Ets2, the Ets2 transactivation domains (Ets2TAD), and the Ets2 DNA binding domain (Ets2DBD). A schematic diagram of these constructs is shown in Fig. 1. The ability of these Ets2 expression constructs to reverse Ras-mediated transformation was analyzed in stable clones generated in the DT cell line, a v-Ki-Ras-transformed derivative of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts (28Noda M. Selinger Z. Scolnick E.M. Bassin R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5602-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This doublytransformed (DT) cell line is well suited for reversion analysis due to its low rate of spontaneous reversion (29Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). To improve the frequency of individual stable drug-resistant colonies expressing high levels of the Ets2 constructs, we used the pCIN4 vector (30Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains an IRES and generates a bicistronic message with the inserted upstream (Ets2) coding sequences at the 5′ side of the mRNA linked by the IRES to the 3′ neomycin phosphotransferase gene. Because both genes are present on a single mRNA, any G418-resistant colonies derived with this vector should express moderate to high levels of the upstream Ets2 coding sequences. Indeed, as was reported for the serotonin receptor (30Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), we found a dramatic increase in the number of pCIN-derived stable colonies detectably expressing Ets2 constructs, relative to that seen using the parental pcDNA3 vector (data not shown), and nearly all of the cell lines had clearly visible expression of the introduced gene products (see below). This high frequency of cell lines expressing the introduced Ets2 constructs allowed us to directly analyze the phenotype of stable clones, without preselecting for adherent revertants as was described previously for the Ets2 DNA binding domain (23Wasylyk C. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis described below, multiple individual stable DT cell clones generated with each Ets2 expression construct or control plasmid were randomly picked, expanded, and assayed for alterations in the transformed phenotype and for expression of the introduced gene product. The ability of fibroblasts to grow in an anchorage-independent manner is a hallmark of cellular transformation, and is the best in vitro assay for predicting malignant tumorigenicity in vivo (31Clark G.J.

NIH3T3 cells are unable to grow in soft agar, whereas the Ras-transformed DT-3T3 cells plate quite efficiently in soft agar. This assay was used to analyze the capacity for anchorage-independent growth of individual DT cell clones transfected with either empty pCIN vector or the pCIN-Ets2 expression constructs schematically shown in Fig. 1.

In this study, we investigated the properties of human recombinant S100A2 (wtS100A2) and of two mutants in which the amino-terminal Ca2+-binding site I (N mutant) and in addition the carboxyl-terminal site II (NC mutant) were replaced by the canonical loop (EF-site) of α-parvalbumin. Size exclusion chromatography and circular dichroism showed that, irrespective of the state of cation binding, wtS100A2 and mutants are dimers and rich in α-helical structure. Flow dialysis revealed that wtS100A2 binds four Ca2+ atoms per dimer with pronounced positive cooperativity. Both mutants also bind four Ca2+ atoms but with a higher affinity than wtS100A2 and with negative cooperativity. The binding of the first two Ca2+ ions to the N mutant occurred with 100-fold higher affinity than in wtS100A2 and a 2-fold increase for the last two Ca2+ ions. A further 2–3-fold increase of affinity was observed for respective binding steps of the NC mutant. The Hummel-Dryer method demonstrated that the wild type and mutants bind four Zn2+ atoms per dimer with similar affinity. Fluorescence and difference spectrophotometry showed that the binding of Ca2+ and Zn2+ induces considerable conformational changes, mostly attributable to changes in the microenvironment of Tyr76 located in site II. Fluorescence enhancement of 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid clearly indicated that Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding induce a hydrophobic patch at the surface of wtS100A2, which, as in calmodulin, may be instrumental for the regulatory role of S100A2 in the nucleus.

The S100 protein family constitutes a large subgroup of Ca2+-binding proteins of the EF-hand type and is composed of at least 16 different members displaying 25–65% identity at the amino acid level (1Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). These proteins contain two distinct EF-hand motifs, separated by a central hinge region. The carboxyl-terminal Ca2+-binding site (site II), called the canonical EF-hand, is composed of 12 amino acids and is common to all EF-hand proteins. The amino-terminal site (site I) contains 14 amino acids and is S100-specific. The three-dimensional structure of S100B (2Kilby P.M. Van Eldik L.J. Roberts G.C.K.

A wide range of different human diseases has been associated with deregulated expression of S100 genes (1Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 7Hilt D.C. Kligman D. Heizmann C.W. Novel Calcium-binding Proteins.

S100 proteins have been implicated in pleiotropic cellular events, with specific functions for each of the family members, such as cell cycle regulation, cell growth, cell differentiation, and motility.S100A2 (formerly called S100L) was first detected at high levels in a subset of cells in lung and kidney and moderately in liver, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle (15Glenney J.R. Kindy M.S. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and was later recognized as the product of a gene located on chromosome 1q21 (16Engelkamp D. Schäfer B.W. Mattei M.G. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6547-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This protein is an unusual member of the S100 protein family because of its predominantly nuclear localization (17Ilg E.C. Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), compared with the cytosolic localization of the other S100 proteins. The cDNA coding for S100A2 was found through subtractive hybridization between normal and tumor-derived human mammary epithelial cells in a search for novel tumor suppressor genes (18Lee S.W. Tomasetto C. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2825-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). S100A2 is preferentially expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells but is down-regulated in breast tumor cells (19Lee S.W. Tomasetto C. Swisshelm K. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2504-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Pedrocchi M. Schäfer B.W. Mueller H. Eppenberger U. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and in several other tumor types as well (17Ilg E.C. Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Expression of S100A2 can be altered by the calcium ionophore A23187 (down-regulation) and by the demethylating agent 5-azacytosine (up-regulation) in cell culture (19Lee S.W. Tomasetto C. Swisshelm K. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2504-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Investigations of the methylation status of the S100A2 promotor region in normal (HBL100) and tumorigenic (T47D) cell lines showed that S100A2 expression is suppressed by DNA methylation (21Wicki R. Franz C. Scholl F.A. Heizmann C.W. Schäfer B.W. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, S100A4 is reported to be overexpressed in metastatic breast cancer cell lines and human tumor tissues (17Ilg E.C. Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Similarly, the expression of S100A4 in mouse melanoma cells led to a metastatic phenotype (22Parker C. Lakshmi B. Piura B. Sherbet G.V. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These results indicate that S100A2 and S100A4 are oppositely regulated and might have inverse functions in tumorigenesis. The protein S100A2 may play a role in inhibiting tumor initiation or suppressing tumor cell growth.The relationship between primary structure and cation binding is poorly understood not only in the S100 family but in general (23Falke J.J. Drake S.E. Hazard A.L. Peersen O.B. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 219-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 24Linse S. Forsén S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 89-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Generally, the dimeric S100 proteins display a low affinity for Ca2+ with a intrinsic association constant ( KCa′) of about 3 × 103m−1 (for a review, see Ref. 8Donato R. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed in more recent studies on S100A4, S100A6, S100B, and S100A11 (25Pedrocchi M. Schäfer B.W. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Heizmann C.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6732-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Allen B.G. Durussel I. Walsh M.P. Cox J.A. Biochem.

Zn2+ can affect the binding of Ca2+ to particular S100 proteins (28Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Leung I.K.M.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6732-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), S100A3 (31Föhr U.G. Heizmann C.W. Engelkamp D. Schäfer B.W. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21056-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), S100A12 (32Dell'Angelica E.C. Schleicher C.H. Santome J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and S100A9 (33Raftery M.J. Harrison C.A. Alewood P. Jones A. Geczy C.L. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 316: 285-293Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that they are able to bind Zn2+ with fairly high affinity. Thus, S100 proteins have variable cation binding properties in agreement with their diversified functions.In order to elucidate the role of S100A2, we investigated the Ca2+- and Zn2+-binding properties of this nuclear protein under physiological conditions. We addressed the question of how the binding of cations to S100A2 is dependent on the intrinsic nature of the loops and on the cross-talk between the paired sites I and II. What is the contribution of each of the sites to ion binding and conformational properties? The approach was to characterize ion binding and conformational properties of wtS100A2 1The abbreviations used are: wtS100A2, recombinant human S100A2 expressed in E. coli; N mutant, S100A2 with the EF-loop of parvalbumin in site I; NC mutant, S100A2 with the EF-loop of parvalbumin in both sites I and II; PV, parvalbumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DTT, dithiothreitol; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonate; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); GdnHCl, guanidinium HCl. 1The abbreviations used are: wtS100A2, recombinant human S100A2 expressed in E. coli; N mutant, S100A2 with the EF-loop of parvalbumin in site I; NC mutant, S100A2 with the EF-loop of parvalbumin in both sites I and II; PV, parvalbumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DTT, dithiothreitol; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonate; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); GdnHCl, guanidinium HCl. and two mutant proteins, in which the loops of site I and site II were replaced by the canonical loop (EF-site) of α-PV. By difference spectrophotometry and fluorimetry, we also compared the Ca2+-dependent changes in the environment of the Tyr residues. Finally, using bis-ANS fluorimetry, an exposure of hydrophobic patches on the surface of the proteins was demonstrated.DISCUSSIONS100A2 exerts its function in the cell nucleus by some presently unknown mechanism. Even in the dimeric state, S100A2 is small enough to enter the nucleoplasm via the nuclear pore complex by passive diffusion (for a review, see Ref. 43Perez-Terzic C. Javoni M. Clapham D.E. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nuclear accumulation may occur if S100A2 is selectively retained through binding to a nondiffusible component in the nucleoplasm, thus offering a plausible explanation why S100A2 is predominantly found in the nucleus. The inner membrane of the nuclear envelope contains inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- and cADPR-modulated Ca2+-channels, which upon stimulation may raise the local Ca2+ to high levels. Nuclear and cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals in turn act on gene expression by coincidental activation of different components of the basic transcription machinery (44Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 45Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hence, as a candidate tumor suppressor gene, S100A2 may well link the nuclear Ca2+ signal to one of the above mentioned transcription components. Indeed, some S100 members activate nuclear protein kinases (e.g. S100B activates the new Ndr kinase 2B. W. Schäfer, and C. W. Heizmann, unpublished data. and binds to bHLH transcription factors (46Baudier J. Bergeret E. Bertacchi N. Weintraub H. Gagnon J. Garin J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7834-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 47Onions J. Hermann S. Grundström T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23930-23937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The question arises as to whether S100A2 has the correct Ca2+ sensitivity and protein-interactive properties. The first purpose of this study was to evaluate these features. We expressed and purified the protein to electrophoretic homogeneity, verified the correct molecular weight, and observed, as for all other S100 members, that the protein is homodimeric, not merely by noncovalent interaction but also through formation of disulfide bridges. Usually, S100 proteins occur as dimersin vitro and in vivo, but S100A2 is also able to form higher polymers under nonreducing conditions (17Ilg E.C. Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).In common with most S100 members, S100A2 binds four Ca2+ions per protein dimer with moderate affinity but with much greater positive cooperativity than in S100A4, S100A6, S100A11, etc. Our study does not allow us to identify the site to which Ca2+ binds first or even to determine whether the binding to this allosteric unit is sequential as in Nereis sarcoplasmic Ca2+-binding protein SCP (48Prêcheur B. Cox J.A. Petrova T. Mispelter J. Craescu C.T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). But it is likely that site I has a lower affinity than in other S100 members, since the sequence CQ (underlined in Fig. 1) in the Ca2+-binding loop of site I deviates strongly from the G(R/K) sequence encountered in the other members. Our data indicate that the four Ca2+-binding sites form an allosteric unit and that binding of the first two Ca2+ ions overcomes an energetically expensive conformational change and leads to a facilitated binding of the next two Ca2+. wtS100A2 binds also two Zn2+ per monomer with an affinity of 2 × 105m−1, i.e. 2-fold higher than in the case of the unusual S100A3 (31Föhr U.G. Heizmann C.W. Engelkamp D. Schäfer B.W. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21056-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have direct evidence that Zn2+ does not bind to the same sites as Ca2+and that, contrary to the case of some other S100 members, Ca2+ and Zn2+ do not act synergistically but rather in an antagonistic manner. Where are the two potential Zn2+-binding sites located? The high affinity for Zn2+ suggests that each binding site contains clusters of at least two His and/or Cys residues (49Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). If human S100A2 has a three-dimensional structure similar to S100A6 or S100B, two clusters are observed per monomer: His18 + Cys22 + His40 and Cys3 + Cys87 + Cys93. Since our data showed that the thiols are well exposed to the polar solvent, these may well represent potential Zn2+-binding sites and would constitute a novel Zn2+-binding motif.Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding to S100A2 proceeds with minimal changes in the secondary structure but with marked changes in the environment of the two Tyr residues, as probed by fluorescence and near UV difference spectrophotometry. Bis-ANS fluorescence and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography indicate that Ca2+ binding also increases the surface-exposed hydrophobicity, which may render the protein more apt to interact with its potential targets in the nucleoplasm. Zn2+ binding shows similar conformational changes, but with different amplitudes, suggesting that Zn2+ also may promote interactions with different targets. If S100A2 acts as a trigger protein in the nucleus, one needs to know the local Ca2+ and Zn2+ concentrations in the nucleoplasm to evaluate the influence of these cations on the biological activity of S100A2. This information is presently not available, but, given the low affinity for Ca2+ and high affinity for Zn2+, it is likely that in vivofluctuations of both cations trigger this protein's nuclear action.The second purpose of this study was to evaluate the cross-talk between the two Ca2+-binding sites of S100A2. Therefore, we replaced the Ca2+-binding sites by the high affinity site of α-PV. In structure-function studies, it is important to confirm that the mutations engineered into the parent protein do not destabilize the general protein structure. A comparison of the CD spectra, stability toward guanidine-HCl, and the quaternary structure of wtS100A2 and the N mutant suggest that the mutation did not dramatically affect the global folding, although local conformational changes occur (see Tyr fluorescence), probably in the region involved in hydrophobic interactions (see bis-ANS fluorescence). A very similar loop grafting experiment on calbindin D9k also confirmed that the overall structure remains the same (50Johansson C. Ullner M. Drakenberg T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8429-8438Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). But the N-terminal segment (4–6 residues) in the loop of site I, which is normally turned “inside out” and coordinates Ca2+ by main chain carbonyls, is in the mutant reoriented “outside out” as in canonical EF-hands and coordinates Ca2+ with the side chain carboxylates. A very similar phenomenon is expected to occur in the case of S100 proteins, since the three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+ forms of S100B (51Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 211-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 52Matsumura H. Shiba T. Inoue T. Harada S. Kai Y.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and S100A6 (54Sastry M. Ketchem R.R. Crescenzi O. Weber C. Lubienski M.J. Hidaka H. Chazin W.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 223-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) shows that site I has a conformation very similar to its conformation in calbindin D9k.The first mutation, replacement of the central loop of site I by that of a canonical EF-hand, strongly increased K 1and K 2 for Ca2+ while barely modifying the K 3 and K 4values, thus abolishing the positive cooperativity. The resulting protein displays negative cooperativity or pairs of independent binding sites of high and low affinity, respectively. The increase in affinity of the first binding step may be explained in two ways: 1) the grafted loop of α-PV is intrinsically of high affinity (55Pauls T.L. Durussel I. Berchtold M.W. Cox J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10393-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 56Rhyner J.A. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Ilg E. Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); 2) Fig. 8suggests that the Ca2+-driven hydrophobic exposure, which is energetically unfavorable, is much less extensive in the mutants than in wtS100A2. Hence, binding energy is no longer sacrificed, and the apparent affinity is higher. In the similar mutants in calbindin D9k, the affinity of the mutated site for Ca2+decreased 30-fold (57Johansson C.

The affinity for Zn2+is only decreased by a factor of 4 by the replacement of site I; a moderate change was also observed in the case of S100B (27Durussel I. Van Eldik L.J. Cox J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and suggests that the EF-hands are not involved in Zn2+binding.When the central loops of both sites of S100A2 have been replaced by those of PV, including a replacement of Tyr76 by Phe, the CD spectra were still similar to those of wtS100A2, and the NC mutant had an even higher affinity for Ca2+ than the N mutant: K1′ and K2′ are increased 1.8- and 3.0-fold, respectively. The latter increase is significant and probably represents binding to site II. Again, the lesser, energetically unfavorable, conformational changes (Fig. 8, compare C andB) may explain why the affinity in the NC mutant is higher than in the N mutant.In summary, the dimeric S100A2 displays an unusually low affinity for Ca2+ but very strong positive cooperativity. The latter is completely lost, but the Ca2+ affinity is strongly increased, in mutants with a canonical Ca2+-binding loop in site I. Two Zn2+ ions bind with an high affinity and induce, as Ca2+, conformational changes including an hydrophobic patch on the protein surface that may be instrumental for the interaction of S100A2 with nuclear targets. The S100 protein family constitutes a large subgroup of Ca2+-binding proteins of the EF-hand type and is composed of at least 16 different members displaying 25–65% identity at the amino acid level (1Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). These proteins contain two distinct EF-hand motifs, separated by a central hinge region. The carboxyl-terminal Ca2+-binding site (site II), called the canonical EF-hand, is composed of 12 amino acids and is common to all EF-hand proteins. The amino-terminal site (site I) contains 14 amino acids and is S100-specific. The three-dimensional structure of S100B (2Kilby P.M. Van Eldik L.J. Roberts G.C.K.

[14C]phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was biosynthetically introduced into inner membrane vesicles from the PE-deficient strain AD93, by reconstitution with the enzyme phosphatidylserine (PS) synthetase. Upon addition of wild type cell lysate containing PS synthetase, and the metabolic substrates CTP and [14C]serine to inside-out vesicles from AD93, [14C]PS was synthesized, which was for the most part converted into [14C]PE. [14C]PE was introduced in right-side out vesicles by enclosing PS synthetase and CTP in the vesicle lumen and adding [14C]serine. The newly synthesized [14C]PE immediately equilibrated over both membrane leaflets (t 1/2 less than one min), as determined by its accessibility toward the amino-reactive chemical fluorescamine. In both inside- out and right-side out vesicles, a 35–65% distribution was found of the newly synthesized PE over the cytoplasmic and periplasmic leaflet, respectively. The transport process of PE was not influenced by the presence of ATP or the proton motive force in inside out vesicles. Pretreatment of both types of vesicles with sulfhydryl reagents, or of right-side out vesicles with proteinase K, did not affect the rate and extent of the transmembrane distribution of the newly synthesized PE.

Phospholipids are the major lipid component of the cell envelope of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Phospholipids are the only lipid constituent in the inner membrane and they build the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. The lipid matrix of the extracellular leaflet of the outer membrane consists of lipopolysaccharide (1Mühlradt P.F. Golecki J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parish E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phospholipid content of the E. coli envelope comprises 75% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 1The abbreviations used are: PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; pmf, proton motive force; ISO, inside out; RSO, right-side out; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; HPTLC, high performance thin layer chromatography; FL-PE, fluorescamine product of PE; NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol. 1The abbreviations used are: PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; pmf, proton motive force; ISO, inside out; RSO, right-side out; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; HPTLC, high performance thin layer chromatography; FL-PE, fluorescamine product of PE; NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol. which is a zwitterionic phospholipid, 20% phosphatidylglycerol, and 5% cardiolipin, both anionic phospholipids (3Raetz C.R.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1978; 42: 614-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipids are synthesized at the cytosolic side of the inner membrane (4Raetz C.R.H. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1235-1238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in growing cells trans- and intermembrane transport of phospholipids must occur from the endofacial leaflet of the inner membrane to the other destinations in the expanding envelope. In this study the transmembrane movement of PE across the inner membrane of E. coli was investigated. Besides being the most abundant phospholipid in E. coli, PE has several specific functions in the membrane, recently reviewed by Dowhan (5Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). PE as a non-bilayer-preferring lipid is essential for the polymorphic regulation of the membrane lipid organization in E. coli(6Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Wielander Å. Christiansson A. Kates A. Manson L.A. Membrane Fluidity. Plenum Publishing Corp., London1984: 205-245Crossref Google Scholar). It also stimulates several membrane transport systems (7Chen C.C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1985; 5: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and is involved as a chaperone in the correct folding of the lac permease in the inner membrane of E. coli (9Bogdanov M. Dowhan W.

Biochemistry. 1980; 77: 1867-1871Google Scholar) demonstrated transport of phospholipids from the inner to the outer membrane ofE. coli in vivo, using pulse labeling of phospholipids followed by subfractionation of the cell envelope. PE appeared in the outer membrane with a t 1/2 of 2.8 min at 37 °C, whereas phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin were transported with half-times shorter than 30 s. Transport of the phospholipids was severely impaired when the proton motive force (pmf) was absent, whereas inhibitors of ATP, protein, or lipid synthesis did not have an effect on the process. Similar pulse labeling studies were performed in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium (12Rothman J.E. Kennedy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Langley K.E. Kennedy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6245-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Rapid transmembrane movement (t 1/2 of 3 min at 37 °C) of newly synthesized PE across the plasma membrane was demonstrated that was completely independent of the synthesis of lipid or protein and also independent of sources of metabolic energy. To investigate the mechanisms of phospholipid transport in more detail,in vitro systems have been used. Recently, transmembrane movement of short chain NBD-labeled phospholipid analogs was characterized in vitro in inner membrane vesicles from the above two prokaryotes. In right-side out vesicles from B. megaterium an inward movement of the analogs was observed after they had been incorporated in the outer leaflet of the membrane (14Hrafnsdottir S. Nichols J.W. Menon A.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4969-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In inside-out inner membrane vesicles isolated from E. coli,transmembrane movement of the fluorescent phospholipids was detected after their incorporation in the cytoplasmic leaflet of this membrane (15Huijbregts R.P.H. de Kroon A.I.P.M. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both prokaryotic in vitro systems have in common that the process of transmembrane movement is not or only slightly phospholipid headgroup-specific, and in both systems transmembrane equilibration is fast with half-times of about 30 s and 7 min at 37 °C in the inner membrane vesicles of B. megaterium andE. coli, respectively. The mechanism of the phospholipid transmembrane movement as well as the suggested involvement of a flippase (14Hrafnsdottir S. Nichols J.W. Menon A.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4969-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Huijbregts R.P.H. de Kroon A.I.P.M. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) remain to be elucidated. In the present work, transmembrane transport of PE in E. coli inner membrane vesicles is investigated under conditions more closely mimicking the in vivo situation. For this purpose anin vitro system was devised in which the transmembrane movement of endogenously synthesized, radiolabeled PE could be monitored using the amino-reactive probe fluorescamine. This chemical reacts very rapidly with amino groups at slightly alkaline pH (16Udenfried S. Stein S. Böhlen P. Dairman W. Liemgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar) and has been successfully used in determining the transmembrane distribution of PE in several organelles and plasma membranes (17Geldwerth D. Kuypers F.A. Butikofer P. Allary M. Lubin B.H. Devaux P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Krebs J.J. Hauser H. Carafoli E. J. Biol.

Acta. 1984; 769: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Tavernier E. Pugin A. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Due to the high amount of PE present in the inner membrane of wild typeE. coli, steric interference of the fluorescamine derivative of PE is likely to prevent the reaction of the newly synthesized radiolabeled PE with fluorescamine from going to completion (21Bishop D.G. Op den Kamp J.A.F. van Deenen L.L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This problem was circumvented by biosynthetically introducing a small amount of PE into inner membrane vesicles of the E. coli strain AD93, which are devoid of PE because of a defect in the enzyme phosphatidylserine synthetase (22DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of a cytosolic lysate from wild type cells containing phosphatidylserine synthetase (23Raetz C.R.H. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2008-2014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), together with the appropriate substrates restores the synthesis of phosphatidylserine (PS) in inner membrane vesicles from AD93. Most of the PS synthesized is subsequently converted into PE by the membrane-bound enzyme PS decarboxylase. An additional advantage of using strain AD93 is that its inner membrane contains a substantial amount of phosphatidic acid (22DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which conveniently serves as a precursor for the synthesis of PS in the reconstituted in vitro system. The synthesis and subsequent transmembrane movement were measured in both inside-out and right-side out vesicles. The outer leaflet of the inside out vesicles corresponds to the cytosolic side of the inner membrane, which is the site of PE synthesis. The transmembrane movement was measured as the sequestration of the newly synthesized PE molecules from the reaction with fluorescamine. In right-side out vesicles, synthesis of PE was generated in the lumen of the vesicle, and transmembrane movement was monitored by detecting the appearance of PE in the outer leaflet. Both approaches showed that the newly synthesized PE equilibrates across the membrane with a half-time of less than 1 min. In both inside-out and right-side out vesicles, the newly synthesized PE distributes in a 35 to 65 ratio over the cytoplasmic and periplasmic leaflet, respectively. l-[3-14C]Serine was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fluorescamine, dithiothreitol, N-ethylmaleimide and octylglucoside were purchased from Sigma. Iodoacetamide was obtained from Fluka. Proteinase K was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals used were analytical grade. The E. colimutant strain AD93 (pss93::kan recA srl:: Tn10 nadB+) (22DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for the isolation of inner membrane vesicles. This strain contains no PE and needs divalent cations for growth. Therefore, cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 mm MgCl2. Cells were harvested in the late log phase, and inside out (ISO) vesicles were isolated as described by Huijbregts et al.(15Huijbregts R.P.H. de Kroon A.I.P.M. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with the exception that the cells were lysed in buffer containing in addition 50 mm MgCl2. ISO vesicles were stored in buffer containing 50 mm triethanolamine-HAc, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose. Small aliquots of the vesicle suspension were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The protein-phospholipid ratio of the ISO vesicles was between 3 and 6 μg of protein per nmol of phospholipid. For the isolation of right-side out (RSO) vesicles, cells were harvested in the late log phase and washed with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0 at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% (w/v) sucrose (75 ml per gram of wet cells), prewarmed to 37 °C. EDTA was added to the cell suspension up to a concentration of 5 mm. After 3.5 min, lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 80 μg/ml, and 1.5 min later the cells were stabilized by adding 10 mm MgCl2. When the formation of spheroplasts as monitored under the microscope was complete (about 30 min after the addition of lysozyme), the spheroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,500 × g max in a GSA rotor (Sorvall) at room temperature for 20 min. From the spheroplasts, RSO vesicles were prepared as described by Huijbregts et al. (24Huijbregts R.P.H. de Kroon A.I.P.M. de Kruijff B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1997; 14: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). RSO vesicles were stored in buffer containing 50 mmtriethanolamine-HAc, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl. Small aliquots of the vesicle suspension were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The protein-phospholipid ratio of the RSO vesicles was in the range of 4.5–7 μg of protein per nmol of phospholipid. Synthesis of PE in ISO vesicles of thepss− strain AD93 was accomplished by reconstitution with S-135 lysate (25de Vrije T. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) from wild type strain W3899 (22DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ISO vesicles (final concentration 0.5 mm phospholipid) were added to PS synthetase buffer (50 mm triethanolamine-HAc, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 15 mm MgAc2), which contained in addition CTP,l-[3-14C]serine, and wild type S-135 lysate, at final concentrations of 1 mm, 0.1 mm, and 0.57 mg/ml protein, respectively, and which had been prewarmed to 37 °C. After the indicated periods of incubation at 37 °C, samples corresponding to 10 nmol of phospholipid were drawn from the suspension, and immediately subjected to phospholipid extraction for analysis of the synthesized 14C-labeled lipids. In addition, samples of 10 nmol phospholipid were drawn, diluted 2.5-fold in ice-cold PS synthetase buffer, and put on ice to determine the accessibility of [14C]PE to fluorescamine (see below). Where indicated, ISO vesicles (0.75 mm phospholipid) were preincubated in PS synthetase buffer with 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide on ice for 30 min before the in vitro synthesis. Alternatively, vesicles were incubated with 1 mm dithiothreitol on ice for 15 min, and subsequently with 10 mm iodoacetamide on ice for 15 min. After the pretreatments the vesicle suspensions were added to the premix containing the components necessary for the synthesis of [14C]PE described above. Where indicated, 10 mm ATP was present during the synthesis reaction. Synthesis of PE in RSO vesicles of AD93 was achieved by enclosing CTP and the enzyme PS synthetase in the lumen of the vesicles using repetitive freeze-thawing. Suspensions of RSO vesicles (0.2 mm phospholipid) in PS synthetase buffer containing 10 mm CTP and lysate (2.31 mg/ml protein) were subjected to 6 cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing on ice. After the final thawing step, the suspensions were diluted in RSO buffer (50 mmtriethanolamine-HAc, pH 7.0, 100 mmKCl), to a vesicle concentration of 0.05 mmphospholipid, and centrifuged at 135,000 ×g max in a TL100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman) at 4 °C for 10 min. The vesicles were washed three times in RSO buffer and then resuspended in this buffer at a concentration of 0.4 mm phospholipid. To assess the contribution to the synthesis of 14C-labeled amino-phospholipids by any remaining non-enclosed PS synthetase, CTP and lysate were added after, instead of before, the 6 freeze-thaw cycles. To start amino-phospholipid synthesis, the vesicle suspension was added to an equal volume of RSO buffer containing MgCl2 (final concentration 50 mm) andl-[3-14C]serine (final concentration 0.222 mm), which had been prewarmed to 37 °C. After different times of incubation, samples containing 10 nmol phospholipid were drawn and either subjected to phospholipid extraction or diluted 2-fold in ice-cold buffer (50 mm triethanolamine-HAc, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl), and put on ice for the reaction with fluorescamine. Before the in vitro phospholipid synthesis, RSO vesicles with PS synthetase and CTP enclosed were treated in several ways as indicated. RSO vesicles (0.35 mm phospholipid) were preincubated with N-ethylmaleimide or dithiothreitol/iodoacetamide in RSO buffer as described for the ISO vesicles except that all incubation times were doubled. Alternatively, vesicles (0.2 mm phospholipid) were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K in RSO buffer for 15 min either on ice or at 37 °C. Proteinase K-treated RSO vesicles were washed twice in RSO buffer before starting the in vitro phospholipid synthesis. Furthermore, the in vitro phospholipid synthesis in RSO vesicles was performed in RSO buffer in the absence of divalent cations or with either 50 mm CaCl2, 50 mmBaCl2, or a combination of 40 mmMgCl2 and 10 mm BaCl2, replacing the 50 mm MgCl2 present in the standard experiment. To determine the pool of PE that is accessible to fluorescamine in both ISO and RSO vesicles, samples (corresponding to 10 nmol phospholipid) drawn from the synthesis reactions, were diluted in ice-cold buffer as already mentioned (final pH 7.5), and incubated on ice with 2 mm fluorescamine, added from a 100 mm stock solution in Me2SO. 15 s after the addition of fluorescamine, the reaction was terminated by adding ethanolamine to a final concentration of 250 mm. To determine the maximal pool of PE accessible to fluorescamine, samples were diluted in buffer containing octylglucoside at a final concentration of 40 mm. The lipids of the samples were extracted and analyzed. Phospholipids of isolated membrane fractions, and from samples of in vitro phospholipid synthesis reactions and fluorescamine accessibility experiments were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The amount of 14C-labeled amino-phospholipids synthesized was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the phospholipid extracts. The amount of PE as a proportion of the amount of radiolabeled amino-phospholipids, and the proportions of PE and the fluorescamine product of PE (FL-PE) obtained after fluorescamine treatment were determined by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) on silica gel 60 plates (Merck) using CHCl3/MeOH/HAc, 65:25:10 (v/v/v) as eluent. The radioactive spots were analyzed and quantified using the PhosphorImager system of Molecular Dynamics. The phosphorus content of lipid samples was determined according to Rouser et al. (27Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2853) Google Scholar). The phospholipid phosphorus content was converted into the phospholipid content by taking into account the phospholipid composition of the membranes of AD93 as determined by HPTLC, because these membranes typically contain around 50% cardiolipin (28Rietveld A.G.

Protein content of membrane fractions, lysate, and the periplasmic fraction was determined with the BCA kit (Pierce). A reconstituted system containing inner membrane vesicles isolated from cells of pss− strain AD93 and a wild type lysate containing the enzyme PS synthetase was used to study the transmembrane movement of in vitro synthesized PE in the inner membrane of E. coli. Fig. 1 A shows the synthesis of the amino-phospholipids PE and PS in ISO vesicles from AD93 incubated with CTP, lysate, and [14C]serine in PS synthetase buffer (lane 1). CTP is required for the synthesis of the intermediate CDP-diglyceride from the phosphatidic acid present in the vesicles. In the presence of serine, CDP-diglyceride is converted into PS by the enzyme PS synthetase. Omitting one of the components resulted in less or no synthesis of amino-phospholipids. When CTP was omitted from the incubation, some amino-phospholipids were synthesized (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). This is probably due to the presence of a small amount of CDP-diglyceride in the membrane of the vesicles. The observation that an incubation of ISO vesicles of AD93 with14C-labeled glycerol-3-phosphate at 37 °C yielded14C-labeled phosphatidylglycerol (data not shown) supports this notion. When the lysate isolated from wild type E. coli, which is the source of the enzyme PS synthetase, was left out of the reaction mixture (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) no amino-phospholipid was synthesized. Mg2+ was not essential for the synthesis of PS in AD93 inner membrane vesicles, but had a stimulatory effect (compare lanes 1 and 4). Amino-phospholipid synthesis increased in the concentration range of 0–20 mm Mg2+, whereas PS decarboxylation was maximal at 15 mm Mg2+ (data not shown). Therefore, this concentration of Mg2+ was used in all further experiments. In the absence of ISO vesicles no lipids were synthesized (lane 5), as expected, because the vesicles are suppliers of both the precursor phosphatidic acid and the enzymes involved in phospholipid metabolism, except for PS synthetase. This result implies that the lysate was essentially membrane free. Apart from the amino-phospholipids, sometimes minor components running faster than PE appeared on the silica plate (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). The presence of these spots depended on the batch of vesicles used in the in vitro synthesis reaction. The nature of the extra spots is unknown, although their rate of flow values are similar to those of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. In Fig. 1 B both the lipid synthesis and the proportion of [14C]PE in ISO vesicles from AD93 are quantified. In the time window shown, none of the components necessary for PS synthesis became limiting, since the curve is almost linear with a small lag time at the start of the synthesis. The amount of amino-phospholipids synthesized during a 15 min incubation at 37 °C corresponded to 0.35 mol % of the endogenous phospholipids. The conversion of PS to PE increased with the concentration of PS in the membrane, and reached a level where 90% of the PS formed was decarboxylated to PE (Fig. 1 B). The transmembrane distribution of the newly synthesized radiolabeled PE was determined using the amino-reactive chemical fluorescamine. Fig. 2 A shows the HPTLC analysis of a sample before (lane 1) and after (lane 2) treatment with 2 mm fluorescamine for 15 s. Upon fluorescamine treatment new spots appeared. The double spot close to the front was identified as the FL-PE. The origin of the double appearance of FL-PE is not known, but it is not due to heterogeneity of the in vitro synthesized PE because a similar double spot appeared when liposomes containing [14C]dioleoyl-PE were treated with fluorescamine. The faint smear in between FL-PE and PE was identified as the fluorescamine derivative of PS. When intact ISO vesicles were treated with fluorescamine, PE was only partially converted into FL-PE, indicating that there was a pool of PE that was protected from the reaction with fluorescamine. To check if the amount of fluorescamine added was sufficient to convert the entire pool of PE present in the vesicles, fluorescamine was added to vesicles solubilized with 40 mm octylglucoside. Fig. 2 A(lane 3) shows that the conversion of PE into the fluorescamine derivative was almost complete in the presence of detergent. The optimal conditions for the determination of the accessibility of PE to the amino-reactive chemical were established by incubating ISO vesicles, containing [14C]PE with different concentrations of fluorescamine for either 15 or 30 s. Fig. 2 B shows that the amount of PE converted into FL-PE was hardly dependent on the concentration of fluorescamine in the concentration range tested. An incubation with fluorescamine of 30 s yielded slightly more FL-PE in both intact and solubilized vesicles than an incubation of 15 s. The shortest period of incubation with fluorescamine technically feasible, 15 s, still resulted in the almost complete conversion of PE into FL-PE in the presence of detergent. Based on these results, it was decided to assay the AD93 vesicles with fluorescamine at a concentration of 2 mm for 15 s. Fig. 3 shows the accessibility of newly synthesized PE to fluorescamine during amino-phospholipid synthesis. The relative amount of FL-PE formed was about 35% of the maximally accessible PE and did not change during synthesis, whereas the absolute amount of PE increased during this time period (compare Fig. 1 B). This indicates that the newly synthesized PE equilibrates very rapidly across the membrane with at 1/2 of less than 1 min. As protease treatment of ISO vesicles degrades phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, sulfhydryl reagents were used to investigate if proteins play a role in the transmembrane movement of PE. A pretreatment of ISO vesicles with N-ethylmaleimide or with a combination of dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide did not affect the transmembrane movement of PE (data not shown). Neither the synthesis of amino-phospholipids nor the relative amount of PE were influenced by these pretreatments (data not shown). To investigate the energy requirements of the transmembrane movement of PE, the in vitro synthesis was carried out in the presence of 10 mm ATP. No effect of ATP could be detected on the rate and extent of the transmembrane distribution of newly synthesized PE (data not shown). The ATP added was able to generate a pmf as was verified by 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine fluorescence measurements (25de Vrije T. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The presence of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone during in vitroPE synthesis in ISO vesicles of AD93 did not affect the accessibility of PE to fluorescamine either, indicating that the pmf is not involved in the process of transmembrane movement of newly synthesized PE. The transmembrane movement of PE in ISO vesicles of AD93 was monitored by determining the PE pool, which is protected from the reaction with fluorescamine, i.e. the pool that has disappeared from the outer (cytoplasmic) leaflet of the ISO vesicles. To confirm the data obtained from ISO vesicles, it was investigated whether the complementary situation, the appearance of the marker molecule at the periplasmic leaflet, could be detected. For this purpose, RSO vesicles isolated from cells of AD93, were used. All of the enzymes involved in PS synthesis, except for PS synthetase, are located in the lumen of the RSO vesicle. Synthesis of PE requires the presence of the enzyme PS synthetase, CTP, and serine in the lumen of the RSO vesicles. Serine can be transported across the inner membrane of E. coli(29Lombardi F.J. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7844-7857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas CTP and PS synthetase cannot. Therefore, these components were enclosed in the lumen of the vesicles by repetitive freeze-thawing of a suspension of RSO vesicles in PS synthetase buffer containing lysate and CTP. Fig. 4 shows that when RSO vesicles, reisolated after the enclosure procedure were incubated with [14C]serine at 37 °C, amino-phospholipids were synthesized (lane 2). There was hardly any synthesis in the control experiment in which CTP and lysate were not enclosed but added immediately after freeze-thawing (Fig. 4, lane 1). In vivo, serine is transported across the inner membrane by several transporters, which depend on the pmf (30Hama H. Shimamoto T. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. Biochim. Biophys.

In general, glucagon (acting through cAMP) and insulin have counter-regulatory effects on hepatic glucose metabolism (reviewed in Granner and Pilkis (22Granner D. Pilkis S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10173-10176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The first committed step in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis are catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucokinase, respectively. Control of both enzymes is achieved by induction and repression of transcription of their respective genes, which is oppositely regulated by cAMP and insulin (22Granner D. Pilkis S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10173-10176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is essential for maintaining blood glucose levels within narrow limits. Lack of control by insulin contributes to hyperglycemia and thus to many of the pathologies afflicting diabetic patients. The PEPCK gene has provided a useful model system for studying the integration of multiple hormonal signals at the level of a single gene (23Wynshaw-Boris A. Short J.M. Loose D.S. Hanson R.W. J.

PEPCK transcription is induced by glucagon (acting via cAMP), glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, and retinoic acid, and is inhibited by insulin and phorbol esters, all of which are mediated through 600 base pairs of the PEPCK promoter (27Quinn P.G.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10173-10176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), e.g. insulin stimulates gene 33 and inhibits PEPCK transcription in nuclei from H4IIe cells (34Chu D.T. Davis C.M. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13007-13011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that gene-specific mechanisms employing combinatorial regulation must be utilized. The combined input of signaling pathways modifies different transcription factors found in unique juxtaposition on the promoters of different genes to set the transcription rates of each gene to a different level (35Frankel A.D. Kim P.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 717-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 36Mitchell P.J. Tjian R.

Nilson J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that multiple CREB binding sites ligated to a minimal PEPCK promoter could mediate induction by PKA and that this could be at least partly inhibited by insulin (39Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14375-14378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that insulin disrupted interactions between CREB, CREB binding protein (CBP) and the RNA polymerase II complex to repress cAMP-inducible PEPCK expression. Similar results were reported by Blenis and Montminy and colleagues (40Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), who provided evidence that insulin stimulates activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of pp90rskII and its binding to CBP, thus preventing induction of a PEPCK promoter (−134/+69) linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Other possibilities for insulin inhibition include: 1) dephosphorylation of the PKA site in CREB; 2) a change in phosphorylation of CREB by other kinases that modify CREB activation when (in)activated by insulin; or 3) the involvement of other transcription factors in the opposing regulation of PEPCK gene expression by cAMP and insulin. With regard to the first, there are conflicting reports regarding the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of CREB, PP1, or PP2a (41Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 709-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S. Peruski L.J. Lickteig R.L. Johnson G.L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). A probable explanation for the discrepancies in these reports is that CREB is inactivated by distinct phosphatase activities in different cell types, which may or may not be regulated by insulin. Insulin inhibition of PP2a activity has been shown to contribute to CREB activation in some cells (44Klemm D.J. Roesler W.J. Boras T. Colton L.A. Felder K. Reusch J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 917-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but phosphorylation of the PKA site in CREB is unaffected by insulin in hepatoma cells (40Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). With regard to the second possibility, there are two intriguing reports of heterologous kinases affecting induction by CREB. First, GSK-3 was shown to phosphorylate Ser-129 in CREB, contributing to its activation (45Fiol C.J. Williams J.S. Chou C.H. Wang Q.M. Roach P.J. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32187-32193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and also to be phosphorylated and inactivated by insulin (46Stambolic V. Woodgett J. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 47Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 48Welsh G. Proud C. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), acting through protein kinase B (15Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of CREB by GSK-3 would not be carried out in insulin-treated cells, and CREB would remain incompletely activated, leading to a decline in transcription. Second, Sun et al. (49Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) showed that phosphorylation of Ser-142 in CREB by CamK II is inhibitory, even in the presence of PKA. This result suggested that modification of Ser-142 or a similar site by an insulin-stimulated kinase could account for the observed inhibition of the PEPCK gene, even if no change was observed in phosphorylation of the PKA site. Concerning the third possibility, Roesler and colleagues have demonstrated that several promoter elements in addition to the CRE are required for induction of PEPCK gene expression in the HepG2 cell model (50Roesler W.J.

They used a combination of DNA binding and functional assays to demonstrate that induction by cAMP requires three C/EBP and one AP-1 site, located between −355 and −225 in the PEPCK promoter, in addition to a promoter region containing the CAAT and CRE elements of the PEPCK gene (−113/+69). Although induction of PEPCK fusion genes by cAMP is robust in HepG2 cells, the endogenous PEPCK gene is not expressed, and cAMP-induced activity of exogenous PEPCK fusion genes is not inhibited by insulin in these cells (55Xing L.P. Quinn P.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1484-1494PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the possibility that one or more of these heterologous elements is required, in addition to the CRE, for opposing regulation by cAMP and insulin of PEPCK fusion genes in the insulin-responsive H4IIe cell line. The present study provides evidence that phosphorylation of CREB by PKA is necessary and sufficient for induction when multiple CREB binding sites are present and that P-CREB persists in insulin-treated cells. Phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-129 or Ser-142 (the GSK-3 and CamK II regulatory sites) can fine-tune induction, but it is not involved in inhibition by insulin. On the other hand, opposing regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by cAMP and insulin requires DNA elements that may bind C/EBP and AP-1 family transcription factors in addition to the CRE. Together with the minimal PEPCK promoter (−40/+1), a tripartite cAMP response unit (CRU), comprised of binding sites for CREB, and an upstream element containing putative C/EBP and AP-1 sites, is sufficient to mediate both induction by cAMP and inhibition of cAMP-inducible gene transcription by insulin. Nuclear extracts were prepared from H4IIe cells after 30 min of hormone treatment, a time at which transcription induction of PEPCK by cAMP in these cells is maximal. Cells were treated with 0.1 mm8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP and/or 10 nm insulin, as indicated. The nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the method of Hurst et al. (56Hurst H.C. Masson N. Jones N.C. Lee K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6192-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), increasing the EDTA to 1 mm and including NaF (20 mm), NaV (1 mm), and okadaic acid (1 μm), to inhibit nuclear protein kinase and phosphatase activities. Aliquots of the nuclear extracts were loaded onto two gels in parallel, which were electrophoresed and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. One of these was probed with anti-PKA-phospho-CREB antibody and the other with anti-CREB antibody, and the blots were developed with chemiluminescent reagents and exposed to film. The epitope-purified PKA-phospho-CREB antibody was a generous gift from David Ginty, Johns Hopkins University. H4IIe cells were grown and transfected as described previously (39Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14375-14378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Xing L.P. Quinn P.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1484-1494PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were transfected in solution with 20 μg of luciferase (firefly) reporter plus 2 μg of each expression plasmid plus 2 μg of pRL-SV (renilla luciferase, Promega Corp.) reporter to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. Half of the cells were seeded into each of two 60-mm dishes, one of which served as a control while the other was treated with 10 nm insulin. Where indicated, cells were cotransfected with an expression vector for the catalytic subunit of PKA, obtained from R. Maurer, Oregon Health Sciences University (57Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 h, the cells were treated with 20% Me2SO for 3 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and then medium with or without 10 nm insulin was added for the remaining 20 h. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, lysed, and luciferase activities for the firefly and renilla luciferase reporters were measured with the Dual Luciferase Kit of Promega, using an ALL Monolight 3010 dual injector luminometer. PEPCK promoter firefly luciferase activity was corrected for renilla luciferase activity in the same sample. All figures represent several transfection experiments, each normalized to the untreated control and the data combined for analysis. The number of experiments for each figure is indicated in the figure legends. The CRG expression vector has been described in detail previously (58Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16999-17009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CRG-S129A and CRG-S142A were created by mutating Ser-129 and Ser-142, respectively, to alanine, using site-directed primers and the Chameleon Mutagenesis Kit of Stratagene Corp. A fragment containing the desired mutation was sequenced in its entirety and used to replace the corresponding fragment in wild type CRG. All expression vector sequences were verified to be correct by DNA sequencing of the final plasmids used for transfection experiments. The pQ-Luc luciferase reporter plasmid is based on the promoterless pGL3-basic vector encoding firefly luciferase, obtained from Promega Corp. and modified to accept PEPCK promoter fragments. An internal BglII site (map position 36) was destroyed by digestion, filling in the ends, and religation. The polylinker of pGL3 was replaced with the polylinker of pQ-CAT (58Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16999-17009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to create pQ-Luc and promoter fragments were inserted in theHindIII and KpnI sites of pQ-Luc. The PEPCK and G4-PEPCK promoters were described previously (55Xing L.P. Quinn P.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1484-1494PubMed Google Scholar), as was the 5XGT promoter (39Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14375-14378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PEPCK promoters terminating at −400, −300, −271, −200, and −134 nucleotides (27Quinn P.G. Wong T.W. Magnuson M.A. Shabb J.B. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pQ-Luc. Site-specific oligonucleotides were used to introduce: 1) aSalI site downstream of the A site (−252); 2)SpeI sites flanking the C site (−245/−225); and 3)Spe sites introduced 3′ of P3 (−225) and 5′ of the CAAT box (−109) in −271-Luc, which has a Sal site immediately 5′ of the promoter region. The corresponding promoter elements were removed by digestion with the appropriate enzyme (SalI orSpeI) followed by religation of the deleted vector. A promoter fragment containing the desired mutation was sequenced in its entirety and used to replace the corresponding fragment in the wild type reporter. The SG4LT-Luc reporter contains a single copy of a GAL4 DNA recognition sequence upstream of the minimal promoter region of PEPCK (−40/+1). Oligonucleotides containing the C site (−248/-227), A site (−265/−247) or both A and C sites (−265/−227) were cloned upstream of the G4 site to create A-SG4LT-Luc, C-SG4LT-Luc, or AC-SG4LT-Luc. All promoter sequences were verified to be correct by DNA sequencing of the final plasmids. The simplest model for the inhibition of PKA-induced PEPCK transcription would involve terminating transcription activation by insulin-mediated dephosphorylation of Ser-133 in CREB, which is phosphorylated by PKA. To determine whether this occurred, nuclear extracts were prepared from H4IIe cells, and the extent of phosphorylation of the PKA site, Ser-133, in CREB was determined. Nuclear extracts were prepared after 30 min, a time at which transcription of the PEPCK gene is maximal (26Sasaki K. Cripe T.P. Koch S.R. Andreone T.L. Petersen D.D. Beale E.G. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15242-15251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots containing identical samples of nuclear extract, prepared to freeze the phosphorylation state of the proteins, were analyzed with antibodies recognizing only PKA-phospho-CREB or all forms of CREB (Fig. 1). The amount of total CREB was unchanged by hormonal treatment, as expected. In contrast, the amount of PKA-phospho-CREB was enhanced by treatment with cAMP (cA). Furthermore, CREB remained phosphorylated in cells treated with cAMP and insulin (cA/I). Thus, insulin inhibition of cAMP-induced PEPCK expression does not require dephosphorylation of the PKA site and inactivation of CREB. Two other phosphorylation sites in CREB are candidates for regulation by insulin. First, Ser-129 in CREB is subject to processive phosphorylation by GSK-3, following phosphorylation of Ser-133 by PKA, and Fiol et al. (45Fiol C.J. Williams J.S. Chou C.H. Wang Q.M. Roach P.J. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32187-32193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylation of both sites was required for full activation of CREB. Since GSK-3 has been shown to be inhibited by insulin (46Stambolic V. Woodgett J. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 47Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 48Welsh G. Proud C. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), its inactivation could result in inefficient activation of CREB. Second, Sun et al.(49Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylation of Ser-142 in CREB by Cam KII had a dominant negative effect, preventing activation by CREB, even when Ser-133 is phosphorylated. Insulin could inhibit induction by targeting Ser-142 in CREB. To determine whether phosphorylation at either of these sites is involved in regulation by insulin, the corresponding serines were changed to alanines by site-directed mutagenesis and the mutant CRGs were tested by cotransfection of H4IIe cells with reporter plasmids containing either the complete G4-PEPCK promoter or the minimal PEPCK promoter, 5XGT-Luc (Fig. 2 A). CRG, CRG-S129A and CRG-S142A all showed induction by PKAc, whereas CRG-S133A did not, with either the G4-PEPCK promoter (Fig. 2 B) or the 5XGT promoter (Fig. 2 C). Induction by CRG-S129A was slightly attenuated, consistent with a small contribution of phosphorylation of Ser-129 to activation in H4IIe cells. Induction by CRG-S142A was slightly enhanced, which is consistent with a negative influence of phosphorylation at that site. However, neither site dramatically affected insulin inhibition of induction by PKA. Finally, the KID domain of CREB, which contains Ser-133, was sufficient to mediate robust induction by PKA with either promoter, although total activity was quite low for 5XGT, due to the absence of other factors supporting basal transcription. Again, insulin only partially inhibited induction mediated by PKA + KID-G4 in 5XGT-Luc, whereas induction was completely inhibited in G4-PEPCK. The extent of inhibition for each promoter was calculated and is presented in Table I. The extent of inhibition of PKA-induced transcription of 5XGT-Luc was indistinguishable from that of basal transcription for either promoter ((−insulin/+ insulin) = 1.2–2). In contrast, insulin inhibited PKA-induced transcription of G4-PEPCK-Luc to a greater extent ((−insulin/+insulin) = 3–4.6), similar to the wild type PEPCK promoter ((−insulin/+insulin) = 4.1). Thus, insulin inhibition of 5XGT-Luc is cAMP-independent. These results indicate that CREB is both necessary and sufficient for induction when multiple binding sites are present, but that induction by CREB alone is not effectively inhibited by insulin. Therefore, the P-CREB·CBP·RNA polymerase II complex cannot be targeted directly by insulin, as we (39Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14375-14378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (40Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R.

Other factor(s), in addition to CREB, must be required for opposing regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by cAMP and insulin.Table IExtent of insulin inhibition of basal and PKA-induced expression of the complete (G4-PEPCK-Luc) and minimal (5XGT-Luc) reporters−Insulin/+insulinG4-PEPCK-LucaThe values for PEPCK-Luc are basal = 1.8, PKA = 4.1.5XGT-LucBasalPKABasalPKACRG1.84.61.41.3CRG-S129A2.03.01.71.2CRG-S142A1.83.51.41.7KID-G41.84.61.41.9The ratio of luciferase activities from untreated versus in"

Each of the nucleotides within this sequence is critical for function, as any substitutions abolish termination. The primary site of termination occurs 7 nucleotides downstream from this sequence but is context-independent (that is, the sequence around the site of termination, and in particular the nucleotide at the site of termination, need not be conserved). Termination requires the presence of the conserved sequence and its complement in duplex DNA and is abolished or diminished if the signal is placed downstream of regions in which the non-template strand is missing or mismatched. Under the latter conditions, much of the RNA product remains associated with the template. The latter results suggest that proper resolution of the transcription bubble at its trailing edge and/or displacement of the RNA product are required for termination at this class of signal.

A variety of signals have been found to modulate the process of transcript elongation. In general, these have been categorized as falling into the following three classes: pause sites, which temporarily halt the RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); PTH, prepro-parathyroid hormone; LH, lysozyme-hypersensitive; TEMED,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; NT, non-template; T, template. 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); PTH, prepro-parathyroid hormone; LH, lysozyme-hypersensitive; TEMED,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; NT, non-template; T, template. but subsequently allow resumption of transcription; termination signals, which cause release of the RNA and dissociation of the transcription complex; and arrest sites, at which the RNAP may be halted for a prolonged period but may escape by cleavage and subsequent elongation of the transcript (for review, see Refs. 1Landick R.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Among the termination signals, the best characterized involve the formation of a stem-loop structure in the nascent RNA (3Chan C.L. Wang D. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Chan C.L. Landick R. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation.

Although there have been reports of pause, arrest, or termination signals that do not involve the formation of a structured RNA (see for example Ref. 6Ring B.Z. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 317-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), these signals have been less well studied. In this work, we have characterized a sequence-specific pause/termination signal for T7 RNAP and have identified the elements that are required for its function. Two types of signals are known to cause pausing and/or termination by T7 RNAP (7Macdonald L.E. Zhou Y. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1030-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Macdonald L.E. Durbin R.K. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Class I terminators, typified by the signal that is present in the late region of T7 DNA (TΦ), encode RNAs that have the potential to form stable stem-loop structures followed by a run of U residues. These features are reminiscent of many intrinsic terminators utilized by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, and a number of bacterial termination signals have been shown to cause T7 RNAP to terminate (8Macdonald L.E.

Chem. 1990; 265: 3823-3830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the members of this class encode RNAs that share a typical secondary structure, they exhibit little sequence homology. A second type of termination signal recognized by T7 RNAP was first identified in the cloned human prepro-parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene (8Macdonald L.E. Durbin R.K. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Mead D.A. Skorupa E.S. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). These signals (class II signals) do not encode RNAs with an apparent consistent secondary structure but share a common sequence (ATCTGTT, in the non-template strand (8Macdonald L.E. Durbin R.K.

Additional members of this class were subsequently identified in the concatemer junction of replicating T7 DNA, in the E. coli rrnB T1 terminator, in a cDNA copy of the intergenic region of vesicular stomatitis RNA, in adenovirus DNA, and possibly in bacteriophage lambda DNA (15Lyakhov D.L.

Wertz G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8388-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Whereas some of these signals function as termination sites, others serve as pause sites that terminate T7 RNAP efficiently only in the presence of T7 lysozyme (an inhibitor of T7 RNAP) or when transcribed by mutant RNAPs that show increased sensitivity to lysozyme (15Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhang X. Studier F.W. J. Mol.

Other mutant T7 RNAPs have been identified that fail to recognize class II signals yet continue to recognize class I signals (8Macdonald L.E. Durbin R.K. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 269: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), indicating that termination at class I and class II sites involves non-equivalent mechanisms. Recognition of class II signals is important for T7 development, as a mutant polymerase that does not recognize a class II pause site found in the concatamer junction of replicating T7 DNA is unable to support T7 growth, apparently due to a block in the processing and packaging of DNA into phage particles (15Lyakhov D.L.

In this work, we have characterized the prototypical class II termination signal found in the PTH gene with the intention of identifying the elements that are required for its function and illuminating its mode of action. We found that termination at this signal is sequence-specific and requires the presence of a conserved sequence in duplex DNA, 7 bp upstream of the site of termination. Each of the nucleotides within this sequence (ATCTGTT in the non-template strand) is critical for function, as any substitutions abolish termination. All plasmids were constructed by standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

DNA oligomers were synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Colorado State University) and purified by low pressure reverse phase chromatography. Prior to transcription, plasmid templates were digested withHindIII, treated with proteinase K, extracted with phenol and chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

Lyakhov, unpublished observations). Note that the site of termination in the intact PTH signal differs from the one previously assigned (8Macdonald L.E. Durbin R.K. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); the original estimate was based upon a determination of the size of the RNA product using DNA markers. We believe that the current assignment is more accurate. 3 The results from Fig. 1 are summarized. Modified PTH signals having individual bp substitutions were constructed by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using pBH220 as a template. The “upstream” primer (DL31, GTGAATTCAATTAATACGACTCACTATAG) included part of the T7 promoter (underlined) and an EcoRI site (italics). The “downstream” primers (DL32–DL50, GCTCTAGATATCAAAACAGATGATCCCCGGGTACCA) included the PTH signal (underlined) and an XbaI site (italics). With the exception of DL33 (which contains the wild type sequence) each of these primers introduced a single bp substitution into the PTH signal, as noted in Table II. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using a PrimeZymeTM kit (Biometra) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Reactions were preincubated at 95 °C for 4 min and subjected to 30 cycles of 92 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s. The products were digested withEcoRI and XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pUC19; the DNA sequence of each cloned interval was confirmed using chain terminating ddNTPs.Table IIEffects of base pair substitutions on PTH functionLaneaThe numbers here correspond to lane numbers in Fig. 3.PlasmidSequencebpDL75 contains the wild type (WT) PTH signal; deviations from this sequence in other plasmids are indicated in bold.Termination efficiency of RNAPWTcData are from Fig. 3; the calculated termination efficiencies include products that arise from termination at both T1 and T2.X19dA similar experiment was carried out with the lysozyme-hypersensitive mutant RNAP, X19.1pDL75CATCTGTTTT0.280.652pDL76TATCTGTTTT0.290.623pDL77AATCTGTTTT0.140.494pDL78GATCTGTTTT<0.01<0.015pDT1CGTCTGTTTT<0.01<0.016pDT2CCTCTGTTTT0.110.307pDT3CTTCTGTTTT<0.01<0.018pDT4CAGCTGTTTT<0.01<0.019pDT5CAACTGTTTT<0.01<0.0110pDT6CACCTGTTTT<0.01<0.0111pDT7CATGTGTTTT<0.01<0.0112pDT8CATATGTTTT<0.01<0.0113pDT9CATTTGTTTT<0.01<0.0114pDT10CATCAGTTTT<0.01<0.0115pDT11CATCGGTTTT0.080.2516pDT12CATCCGTTTT<0.01<0.0117pDT13CATCTCTTTT<0.01<0.0118pDT14CATCTTTTTT<0.01<0.0119pDT15CATCTATTTT<0.01<0.01a The numbers here correspond to lane numbers in Fig. 3.b pDL75 contains the wild type (WT) PTH signal; deviations from this sequence in other plasmids are indicated in bold.c Data are from Fig. 3; the calculated termination efficiencies include products that arise from termination at both T1 and T2.d A similar experiment was carried out with the lysozyme-hypersensitive mutant RNAP, X19. Open table in a new tab To prepare synthetic templates the combinations of oligomers indicated were mixed together (final concentration 0.5 μm, each oligomer) in 40 μl of GHT buffer (30 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.8; 100 mm potassium glutamate; 15 mmMg(OAc)2; 0.25 mm EDTA; 1 mmdithiothreitol; 0.05% Tween 20) (23Maslak M. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6918-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the samples were heated to 70 °C for 10 min and then cooled slowly.

Unless otherwise noted, transcription reactions were carried out in a volume of 10 μl in GHT buffer (see above) containing 0.5 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Ultrapure); 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (specific activity of 800 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) or 4 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP (specific activity of 6,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products); 10–20 ng of RNA polymerase, 1 μg of plasmid template or 50 nm synthetic DNA template, and 4 units of RNasin (Boehringer Mannheim). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the products were analyzed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea as described previously (22He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D.L. Gartenstein H. Diaz G.A. Castagna R.C. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in each electrophoretic species was quantified by exposing the gel to a PhosphorImagerTM screen (Molecular Dynamics) using a Storm 860 scanner and ImageQuaNT Version 4.2a software (Molecular Dynamics). The termination efficiency was calculated as: termination efficiency = (termination product)/(termination product + run-off product) taking into account the base composition of the individual transcripts. To prepare RNA size markers, plasmid pBH183 digested with HindIII was transcribed with the mutant T7 RNAP del172-3 in a volume of 40 μl containing 4 μg of DNA, 100 ng of del172-3 RNAP, 80 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP, 0.2 mm GTP, and 0.5 mm ATP, CTP, and UTP under standard conditions (see above) at 37 °C for 30 min. DNase was then added (1 unit, Promega), and the sample was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. To generate specific fragments, 18 ng of RNase A (Boehringer Mannheim) or 2 units of RNase T1 (Boehringer Mannheim) were added to 15 μl of the reaction, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 1 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of stop buffer, and the products were resolved by electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 7 m urea, along with termination and run-off products made by transcription of pBH183 with wild type T7 RNAP under standard conditions using [α-32P]ATP as the label, as described previously (Ref. 22He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D.L. Gartenstein H. Diaz G.A. Castagna R.C. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; see Fig. 2). All reactions were carried out in 40 mmK-HEPES, pH 7.8; 6 mm dithiothreitol; 10 mmMgCl2. The template strand oligonucleotide BH123 (500 nm) was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-2P]ATP (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the kinase was inactivated by heating to 80 °C. To construct double-stranded templates, the labeled template strand oligomer was mixed with the indicated non-template strand oligomer (see Fig. 7) at a concentration of 250 nm (each oligomer), and the reactions were heated to 95 °C and cooled slowly to room temperature. The annealed template (1 μl) was mixed with 2 μl containing 125 nm T7 RNAP, 1 mm GTP, and 1 mm ATP (in the same buffer), and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 2 min. The reactions were then completed by the addition of 2 μl containing 2.5 mg/ml sodium heparin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 mm CTP and UTP. After further incubation for 2 min the reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of stop buffer containing 0.2% SDS, and the products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions (24Daube S.S. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The gels (1.5 mm × 14 cm × 14 cm, 10% acrylamide:bisacrylamide (19:1), 1× TBE, 4 mmMg(OAc)2, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% ammonium persulfate, and 0.01% TEMED) were pre-equilibrated at 60 V for 1 h at room temperature. Following loading of the samples, electrophoresis was continued at 60 V for 12 h. Samples to be analyzed under denaturing conditions were mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (6 m urea; 10 mm Na3EDTA, pH 8.0; 0.01% xylene cyanol; and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and analyzed as described previously (22He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D.L. Gartenstein H. Diaz G.A. Castagna R.C. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Products were visualized by exposing the wet gels to film at −70 °C or to a PhosphorImagerTM screen, as described above. The PTH termination signal had previously been localized to a 31-bp segment that extends 24 bp upstream and 7 bp downstream from the termination site (8Macdonald L.E. Durbin R.K. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To define the sequences that are essential for PTH function, a series of synthetic oligomers that include portions of this interval were cloned downstream from a T7 promoter (Table I). Transcription of these plasmid templates in vitro (Fig. 1) revealed that replacement of PTH sequences with plasmid sequences as close as 16 bp upstream from the termination site still allowed full signal function (i.e.pBH196). However, the replacement of one additional residue (C to G at −15 in pBH184) abolished terminator function. Thus, the minimal upstream boundary of the PTH terminator is 15 bp from the termination site. Substituting PTH sequences from the downstream direction as far as 5 bp upstream from the termination site had little effect (i.e.pBH220), but replacement of one additional residue significantly lowered the efficiency of termination (i.e. pBH221). The latter substitution affects a U-rich region in the transcript that had previously been shown to be essential for function (14Mead D.A. Skorupa E.S. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that the minimal PTH sequence that is required for full terminator function lies between −15 to −6 (where −1 identifies the position of the last base copied into the transcript; see below). From the sizes of the transcripts, it appeared that the site of termination in pBH2O2 was the same as in pBH183, even though the region around the termination site had been replaced with plasmid sequences in pBH2O2. To determine the sites of termination more precisely, we utilized an RNase mapping method. Transcription of a plasmid that contains the PTH signal with the mutant T7 RNAP del172-3 (which fails to recognize this signal; Ref. 17Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) results in the synthesis of a homogeneous read-through product. Partial digestion of this transcript (labeled at its 5′ end by the incorporation of [γ-32P]GTP) with RNase A and T1 generates a characteristic ladder of products. As shown in Fig. 2, the termination product from pBH183 (which contains the unmodified PTH signal) migrates slightly more slowly than the RNase A cleavage product that ends with … . CpUpUpGpCp, indicating that termination occurs following incorporation of the C residue noted in Table I. (The RNase A and T1 cleavage products have a phosphate group at the 3′ end of the RNA, and the termination products have a hydroxyl group at this position. For this reason, the termination product migrates more slowly than the equivalent marker RNA species; Ref. 25Fodor E. Pritlove D.C. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4012-4019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar.) In a similar fashion, the site of termination in the modified signal in pBH2O2 was localized to the T residue indicated in Table I (see Fig. 2 B). Thus, even though the sequence around the site of termination has been altered in pBH2O2 (including the nucleotide at the site of termination) the position at which termination occurs relative to the boundaries of the conserved sequence upstream remains the same. A similar conclusion was previously reached by Macdonald et al. (8Macdonald L.E. Durbin R.K. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition to the major termination product mapped above, a minor termination product is also observed (Fig. 1). This RNA is 4 nt shorter than the major termination product, as evidenced by comigration of the minor RNA from pBH190 with the longer product from pBH195. (Due to the deletion of 4 bp in the region that lies upstream of the PTH signal in pBH195, the length of the transcription products from this plasmid are expected to be 4 nt shorter than those from pBH190; see Table I.) From this result, we conclude that the minor site of termination at the PTH signal (T1) is 4 nt upstream from the major site (T2; see Table I). This conclusion is supported by the position of the minor transcript from pBH183 relative to the RNA size markers (visible upon longer exposure of the film shown in Fig. 2 A). The analysis summarized in Table I identified a 10-bp interval (CATCTGTTTT in the non-template strand) that functions to provide efficient termination. A comparison with other class II signals reveals a 7-bp sequence (underlined) found in all of these signals (Table I) (15Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the importance of individual base pairs to PTH function, we constructed modified signals having single base pair substitutions and examined their ability to terminate T7 RNAP (Fig. 3 and TableII). In this analysis, we did not investigate the effects of substitutions of the four U residues that lie downstream from the conserved sequence, as the importance of these residues to terminator function had already been demonstrated (Refs. 8Macdonald L.E. Durbin R.K. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholarand 14Mead D.A. Skorupa E.S. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar and see above). Strikingly, any substitutions of base pairs within the conserved sequence resulted in strong inhibition of signal function, indicating a strict requirement for sequence conservation in this region. Conservation of the bp just upstream of the underlined sequence (C ATCTGTT), although important, is not absolutely required, as all substitutions except G at this position were well tolerated. We therefore conclude that the minimal"

The control of transcriptional initiation in eucaryotes is a multilayered process. At one end of the spectrum are the very specific interactions between distinct sequence motifs and defined transcription factors that can interact with a specific sequence only. Secondary protein-protein interactions between such DNA-binding factors and so-called transcriptional adapter molecules also show molecular specificity (1Tansey W.P. Herr W.

The mechanism of action and the specificity of other control elements pertinent to gene expression are of more general nature. Here, one may distinguish between control mechanisms of gene expression from a given locus and those that are acting downstream of this decisive event to facilitate efficient transcriptional initiation and elongation induced by the sequence-specific transcription factors mentioned above. Among the former are locus control regions (5Davie J.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162A: 191-250PubMed Google Scholar), matrix attachment regions (6Boulikas T. J. Cell.

Thus, it is feasible that these proteins have dual functions, as have been proposed for other DNA/RNA-binding proteins in prokaryotes and in polymerase III genes (30Pelham H.R.B. Brown D.D. Proc.

Although each rearranged gene has a distinct promoter, distal enhancers are found in introns and 3′ of the genes (32Nelsen B. Sen R. Int. Rev.

Furthermore, close to the intron enhancers, matrix attachment regions are found, and recent evidence indicates that these function as locus control regions (33Forrester W.C. van Genderen C.

The octamer, which is a binding site for the ubiquitous OCT1 and the B cell-specific OCT2 transcription factors, is a key control element in κ promoters and when mutated the promoter is inactivated (37Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the promoter is dependent on other, octamer-dependent, transcriptional control elements for proper function (37Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Such elements have been identified both 5′ and 3′ of the octamer and examples thereof are the κ-Y element (44Atchison M.L. Delmas V. Perry R., P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3109-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the pentadecamer (pd) element containing an E-box of the E2A type (-CAGNTG-) (38Falkner F.G. Zachau H.G. Nature. 1984; 310: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 41Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the CCCT element (39Högbom E. Magnusson A.-C. Lenderson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4347-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 42Sigvardsson M. Åkerblad P. Leanderson T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3788-3796PubMed Google Scholar). All three elements interact with distinct proteins in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and interact functionally with the octamer (42Sigvardsson M. Åkerblad P. Leanderson T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3788-3796PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). So far, only the proteins that interact with the κ-Y element have been identified, PU.1 and elf-1, both of which belong to the Ets family of transcription factors (43Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 45Schwarzenbach H. Newell J.W. Matthias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 898-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this study, we purified a protein that interacts with a functionally important A-T-rich region within the SP6 κ promoter pd element and identified it as CArG-box binding factor-A (23Kamada S. Miwa T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 119: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). J558 plasmacytoma cells were grown in large cell culture flasks that were harvested every 2–3 days, and nuclear extracts were prepared according to a modification of the Dignam method using buffer C′ (46Dignam J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar, 47Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The nuclear extracts were pooled and precipitated sequentially with increasing amounts of ammonium sulfate, and the pellets were dissolved in buffer Z (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) (48Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The material that precipitated between 70 and 90% ammonium sulfate saturation was dialyzed against buffer Z and was loaded onto a native DNA cellulose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer Z. After washing, bound proteins were eluted stepwise in 100 mm steps up to 1 m KCl in buffer Z. Fractions containing the pdLMW binding activity (41Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (500 mm and 600 mm KCl) were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 25 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and loaded onto a MonoQ™ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in buffer A. After washing with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with a continuos gradient of buffer B (as A but 500 mm KCl). SDS-PAGE and electroblotting were performed according to standard procedures (49Sambrook L. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and blotted proteins were immunodetected by chemiluminescence (50Nesbitt S.A. Horton M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For blocking of the antisera, 3 μl of protein G purified sera was preincubated with 50 μg of recombinant protein for 30 min on ice before it was added to the membranes. For amino acid sequencing, the protein band was identified in the gel after Coomassie Blue staining, excised, and sent to SLU (Bo Ek, Uppsala, Sweden) for trypsin digestion, peptide purification by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, and amino acid sequencing. Northern blots were performed according to standard procedures using 0.5 μg of poly(A) RNA per lane (49Sambrook L. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was purified using a QuickPrep™ micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CArG-box binding factor-A was cloned from a HybriZAP cDNA library made from murine B cells that had been stimulated with lipopolysaccharide for 72 h, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene), using an end-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-ATCAAGGTTGCCCAGCCCAAAGAG-3′) according to standard procedures (49Sambrook L. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A clone that contained the complete 5′ sequence but lacking a part of the 3′ untranslated region was cloned (23Kamada S. Miwa T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 119: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The cDNA was cut with NcoI, blunt-ended, and then cut with SacI and inserted between theSmaI and the SacI site in the pGEM3Z plasmid (Promega). This plasmid was completely digested with EcoRI and then partially digested with BamHI, and the CArG-box binding factor-A fragment derived in this manner was inserted in frame with the glutathione S-transferase gene between theBamHI and the EcoRI sites in the pGEX-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was expressed and purified on glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), whereafter it was further purified on a MonoQ™ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was cleaved by incubating with 0.5 units of thrombin (Sigma) in 200 μl of digestion buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 10% glycerol) at room temperature for 2–3 h. The polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits according to standard procedures using the GST-CArG-box binding factor-A fusion protein. The IgG fraction was purified on a Protein G HiTrap™ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Variants 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10 were generated by PCR (15 cycles) using primers 1 and 5, 2 and 5, 3 and 5, 2 and 4, 3 and 4, respectively, and the cloned CBF-A cDNA as a template. Variants 4, 5, and 6 were generated by primary PCRs using primer 5 and 6, 7, or 8, respectively, or primer 1 and 4 for 15 cycles to generate fragment 1–4. The fragments were gel-purified, pre-PCR in the absence of primers was performed with fragment 4 and 1, 2, or 3 for 20 cycles, new Taq enzyme and primers 1 and 5 were added to the reactions, and 15 cycles more were performed. After digestion withBglII and EcoRI, the fragments were then cloned between the BamHI and EcoRI sites in the GST vector pGEX-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All constructs were verified by sequencing of the first 250 base pairs using the pGEX 5′ sequencing primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequence of the primers used were: 1) 5′-GAGAGATCTCCGAGCGGGAACCAGA-3′; 2) 5′-GAGAGATCTGCGGGAAAAATGTTCGTT-3′; 3) 5′-GCTAGATCTATGAAGAAGGACCCTGTG 3′; 4) 5′-CCTCTGAATTCTAGGCAACCTTGATTTC 3′; 5) 5′-TCCGAATTCCTCTCAGTATGGCTTGTA-3′; 6) 5′-CGCCAGCAAGAACGAGGAGGACGCGGGAAAAATCTTTGTGGGAGGTCTAAACCCTG-3′; 7) 5′-GGCTATGGCTATGAAGAAGGACCCTGTGCAGCCCAAAGAGGTGTATCAGCAACAGC-3′; 8) 5′-CGCCAGCAAGAACGAGGAGGACGCGGGACAGCCCAAAGAGGTGTATCAGCAACAGC-3′. The deletion mutants were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione beads as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and subsequently dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline for 8 h with one buffer exchange. The amounts of the different variants were estimated by A 280 measurement. EMSAs, transfections, and CAT assays were performed as described (43Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but for the EMSAs single-stranded probe was used unless stated different in the figure legends. Preimmune or immune serum was added before the addition of the probe, and the reactions were then preincubated for 30 min at room temperature. The sequences of the probes can be found in the figures. For the EMSA in Fig. 5 B, the promoter region of the SP6 κ gene was cloned between the PstI and the HindIII sites of the pGEM3Z vector (Promega). An end-labeled promoter probe was generated by Klenow fill-in labeling after XbaI digestion followed by digestion with HindIII. Native PAGE purified probe in bind buffer was denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and then rapidly cooled on ice. 6000 cpm of native or denatured probe was added to 25 μl of footprint binding buffer with different amounts of protein as indicated. The reactions were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, whereafter an aliquot of 10 μl was separated on a 5% native PAGE gel in 1× TBE. Stop buffer (0.67% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.3 mg/ml tRNA, 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K, and 0.3% bromphenol blue) (51Pontius B.W. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8403-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was then added, and the reaction was continued for 5 min. The reactions were then separated by native PAGE as above. The footprint assays were performed according to standard procedures, and single-stranded or double-stranded probes (20 000 cpm) were used as indicated. After preincubation for 30 min in 50 μl of bind buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmspermidine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) on ice, 50 μl of 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm MgCl2 was added and finally 0.25 μg of DNase was added. After incubation for 1 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of DNase stop buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA), whereafter the reaction was phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. The reactions were separated on 20% denaturing PAGE gels. The ladders were made according to the rapid protocol for G/A Maxam-Gilbert sequencing (49Sambrook L. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The methylation interference assay was performed essentially as described in Ref. 41Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, although a single-stranded probe was used and that the probe was gel-purified after methylation. Recombinant thrombin-cut CBF was used in EMSA with methylated probe (100,000 cpm), and about 50% of the probe was shifted. The bound and free probe was identified after autoradiography, excised and eluted over night. The reaction was separated on a 15% denaturing PAGE gel. Recombinant GST or GST/CArG-box binding factor fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and the beads were then washed in NETN. After incubating 10 μl of beads with 1 μl of in vitro translated protein (43Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) labeled with [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 300 μl of NETN for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times in NETN at room temperature, 10 μl of SDS load was added to the beads, and bound proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE after heating to 95 °C. The gels were either fixed (45% methanol and 10% HAc) and dried or transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and then autoradiographed. The pull-downs using the different deletion mutants were made as described above, and 0.006 OD units were loaded of each mutant to 10 μl of beads as described above. Quantifications were made in a phosphorimager (Fuji Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000). The region 5′ of the octamer in the murine SP6 κ promoter has two sequence elements, the pd and κ-Y elements, that stimulate transcription by synergistic interactions with the octamer (41Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 44Atchison M.L. Delmas V. Perry R., P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3109-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 45Schwarzenbach H. Newell J.W. Matthias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 898-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The pd element can be further divided into two sites, a 5′ E-box of the E2A type and a 3′ A-T-rich region (41Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The individual function of these three sites was tested by transient transfections of CAT reporter constructs into lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells (41Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A promoter fragment containing the pd, the κ-Y, and the octamer element stimulated transcriptional initiation when placed upstream from a TATA-box, as compared with the TATA-box alone (Fig. 1 A; compare the first two lanes). When the octamer was mutated only limited transcriptional stimulation was observed (third lane); this confirmed earlier studies showing that the octamer is obligate for promoter function (37Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The individual function of the three sites 5′ of the octamer was tested by introducing mutations in the reporter construct. Deletion of the 5′ E-box of the pd element, or mutations in either the A-T-rich region or the κ-Y element all diminished the costimulatory function (fourth through sixth lanes). Thus, the interdependence of the three 5′ elements for octamer costimulation was confirmed (43Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Next, the pd element was used as probe in an EMSA with nuclear extract from the plasmacytoma cell line J558L as protein source (Fig. 1 B). As described previously, two complexes were formed (pdMMW and pdLMW; Ref. 41Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the A-T-rich region was mutated, no pdLMW complex was formed while the pdMMW complex was unaffected. A mutation of the E-box did not affect the pdLMW complex but the pdMMW complex was reduced in intensity. The binding of the pdMMW complex merits some comment, as it may seem to be in contrast to an earlier report where mutations of the E-box disrupted binding (41Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, different methods were used to generate the nuclear extracts; the method of Schreiber et al. (52Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar) was used in the earlier report, whereas a modification of the Dignam method (47Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) was used here. Thus, the pdMMW shift here appears to be composed of two overlapping complexes: a specific E-box binding complex that does not bind to the mutated E-box and a nonspecific binding complex that also interacts with single-stranded DNA (data not shown). To identify the A-T region interacting protein, we developed a three-step method that was used for purification (Fig. 2 A). Nuclear extract was made from the J558L plasmacytoma cell line according to a modification of the original Dignam method (46Dignam J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar, 47Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the extract was sequentially precipitated with ammonium sulfate in 10% steps. The pdLMW activity precipitated mainly in the 70–80% and 80–90% ammonium sulfate saturation fractions, while the pdMMW activity (and most other transcription factors) precipitated at concentrations below 40% saturation (data not shown). The 70–80% and 80–90% fractions were pooled and loaded onto a native DNA cellulose column, and while most contaminating proteins passed through the column at 100 mm salt concentration, the pdLMW activity was eluted in the 500 and 600 mm fractions (data not shown). These two fractions were pooled, loaded onto a MonoQ™ ion exchange column, and eluted with a continuos gradient of KCl. Every second fraction was tested for protein content by SDS-PAGE and for pdLMW binding activity in EMSA (Fig. 2 B, left panels). The activity eluted in one peak in fractions 24–26, as did an approximately 35-kDa protein, a molecular mass in agreement with a preliminary characterization of the pdLMW activity (41Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A contaminating protein of higher molecular mass eluted earlier than and overlapping with the 35-kDa protein. The purification steps were monitored by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B, right panels). Although some contaminating proteins were evident after the DNA-cellulose step, only the higher molecular mass protein contaminated"

Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 279-305Google Scholar). Three classes of AKs, differing in size, subcellular localization, and substrate specificity were identified in vertebrates, AK1in the cytosol, AK2 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and AK3 (called also GTP:AMP phosphotransferase) in the mitochondrial matrix. Only one form of AK was identified in bacteria. Mitochondrial adenylate kinases (AK2, AK3) and the vast majority of bacterial adenylate kinases belong to the class of long forms. They differ from AK1 and some bacterial AKs, the short variants, by a 28-residue long insertion organized into a small domain (2Schulz G.E. Schiltz E. Tomasselli A.G. Franck R. Brune M. Wittinghofer A. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J.

Sequence alignment of AKs from Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, devoid of metal, showed that in the latter species the Cys residues are substituted with four other highly conserved amino acids, His, Ser, Asp, and Thr (Fig. 1 B). This conservation suggests that these particular residues have some essential function, but different in the enzyme from the Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes. A noticeable exception is AK from the Gram-negative bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans. This enzyme not only conserves the Cys-containing sequence found in AK from Gram-positive species but binds zinc or iron (8Deligiannakis Y. Boussac A. Bottin H. Perrier V. Bârzu O. Gilles A.-M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9446-9452Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we substituted His126, Ser129, Asp146, and Thr149 in Escherichia coli adenylate kinase with cysteine residues. Our aim was to know whether a motif composed of 3 or 4 Cys residues generates a metal-binding site in AK or whether other structural factors contribute to the specificity (zinc versus iron or any other metal) or to the strength of the protein/metal interaction. On the other hand, we wanted to know the relevance of the metal binding for catalysis or stability of AK. A number of variants of AKecontaining one to four cysteine residues were thus obtained. In agreement with previous studies on zinc-binding AKs, we found that the 3 and 4 cysteine modified forms of AKe acquired zinc binding properties. Moreover, the 4 cysteine-containing AKe exhibited an increased stability against thermal denaturation as compared with the wild-type form, with full conservation of its catalytic properties. Adenine nucleotides, coupling enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and restriction enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim. T4 DNA polymerase was from Biolabs. T7 DNA polymerase and Deaza sequencing mixes kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Blue Sepharose (Cibacron Blue 3 G-1 Sepharose CL-6B) was from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnologies Inc. TPCK-treated trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, PMPS, 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR), and DTNB were purchased from Sigma. TheE. coli NM554, CJ236, and BL21(DE3) strains were used for cloning experiments, site-directed mutagenesis, and recombinant protein overproduction, respectively (9Raleigh E.A. Lech K. Brent R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar, 10Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W.

Plasmid pEAK91 carries the E. coli adk gene (11Reinstein J. Brune M. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4712-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by A. Wittinghofer (Max Planck Institut für Molekulare Physiologie, Dortmund). Plasmid pPV1003 is a pET22b derivative carrying the adk gene subcloned from pEAK91. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to Kunkel et al. (12Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). A 91 bases long primer (see Table I) containing 7 mismatched bases allowed several simultaneous substitutions in the adk gene. Mutant plamids from 48 randomly selected clones were further analyzed. A panel of single, double, triple, and quadruple mutants was obtained. Some additional variants, not resulting from this procedure, were created individually with appropriate primers (see Table I). Absence of any other mutation in the adk gene was checked on all plasmids. Overproduction of various AK forms was performed by growing strain BL21(DE3)/pDIA17 containing pVP1003 derivatives in LB medium (13Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 30 mg/liter chloramphenicol. Overproduction was carried out by adding 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside when the culture reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.0. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 3 h after induction.Table IOligonucleotides used for the construction of AKecysteine-substituted mutantsThe asterisk (*) indicates the position of the mismatches. Open table in a new tab The asterisk (*) indicates the position of the mismatches. The adenylate kinase overproduced in E. coli was purified as described previously (14Bârzu O. Michelson S. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When required, purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, then lyophilized. Enzyme activity was determined at 30 °C using the spectrophotometric assay (15Saint Girons I. Gilles A.-M. Margarita D. Michelson S. Monnot M. Fermandjian S. Danchin A. Bârzu O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 622-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements were made at 334 nm (0.5 ml final volume) using an Eppendorf ECOM 6122 photometer. One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to 1 μmol of the product formed in 1 min at 30 °C and pH 7.4 (in the direction of ATP formation). Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), using a Bio-Rad kit. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The metal in various forms of AK was quantitated colorimetrically, using the metal-binding dye PAR as described previously (5Glaser P. Presecan E. Delepierre M. Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Bârzu O. Gilles A.-M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Perrier V. Surewicz W.K. Glaser P. Martineau L. Craescu C.T. Fabian H. Mantsch H.H. Bârzu O. Gilles A.-M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9960-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, using a graphite furnace instrument. The protein samples and the zinc standard solutions were diluted with water purified to 18.2 megohms/cm resistivity. In all cases, the background levels of zinc were insignificant. The thermal stability of different proteins was studied by differential scanning calorimetry using an ultrasensitive Microcal MC-2D instrument at a scanning rate of approximately 50 °C/h. Proteins in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) were in the range of 1–1.5 mg/ml. Differential scanning calorimetry data were analyzed by the software provided by Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA. The mutants were named according to the position of key residues in the motif126His-X 2-Ser-X 16-Asp-X 2-Thr149. Thus, the HSDT variant is the wild-type AKe. AKeC4 corresponds to the 4 Cys-substituted enzyme, AKeHC3 to HCCC, AKeC3T to CCCT, AKeC2DT to CCDT, AKeHSC2 to HSCC, and AKeHC2T to HCCT. To create a 4-Cys-substituted mutant of AKe, a single nondegenerate 91-base oligonucleotide, was designed spanning the adk gene region corresponding to the LID domain in the protein (TableI). The 7 mismatched bases in the oligonucleotide allow simultaneous substitutions of His126, Ser129, Asp146, and Thr149 codons with cysteines. Out of 48 randomly selected clones, two-thirds carried one or several substitutions with cysteine residue(s) and one-third harbored the expected quadruple modification. Considering the length of the oligonucleotide and the relatively low yield of its synthesis, the mutagenesis reaction was fairly effective and produced in one step a panel of single, double, and triple mutants displaying different positions of substitution. Missing species were constructed with appropriate primers (Table I). The overproduced variants of AKe (about 20% of the soluble E. coli proteins) exhibited high specific activity in crude extracts (90–120 units/mg of protein), close to that of the wild-type AKe, indicating that substitution with cysteine of any of the four targeted residues has no direct consequences on enzyme activity. Chromatography on blue Sepharose and Ultrogel AcA54 yielded homogeneous preparations of enzymes. The double Cys-substituted AKe species, HC2T, and CSDC were inactivated during purification in the absence of reducing agents. They conserved only 5% (23 units/mg of protein) and 37% (175 units/mg of protein) of wild-type activity. The zinc content of different variants of AKe, was quantified either by atomic absorption spectrophotometry or with the metal-binding dye PAR. The enzymes were first reacted with PMPS (18Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Giedroc D.P. Keating K.M. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8452-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the formation of the PMPS-sulfhydryl chromophore being followed at 250 nm. Linear incorporation of PMPS into the proteins was observed up to 3.4 ± 0.3 equiv./mole of C4 mutant, 2.3 ± 0.1 equiv./mole of HC3and C3T mutants (Fig. 2 A). The released Zn2+ (0.73–0.82 mol of zinc/mol of protein) was determined spectrophotometrically with PAR (Fig. 2 B). Atomic absorption spectrophotometry confirmed that the quadruple and the triple Cys mutations conferred to the protein the ability to bind the metal (0.8 ± 0.1 mol of zinc/mol of protein). Less than 0.03 mol of zinc/mol of protein was found in the wild-type AKe. No iron was observed in AKeC4 when E. coli was cultivated in minimal medium supplemented with this metal (data not shown). Wild-type AKe contains a buried cysteine residue in position 77. It reacted with DTNB only in the presence of urea over 2 m (15Saint Girons I. Gilles A.-M. Margarita D. Michelson S. Monnot M. Fermandjian S. Danchin A. Bârzu O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 622-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same was true for AK from Bacillus subtilis and AK from Bacillus stearothermophilus, although they contain, besides the conserved Cys77, 3 and, respectively, 4 other Cys residues in the LID domain (5Glaser P. Presecan E. Delepierre M. Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Bârzu O. Gilles A.-M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Perrier V. Surewicz W.K. Glaser P. Martineau L. Craescu C.T. Fabian H. Mantsch H.H. Bârzu O. Gilles A.-M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9960-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, surprising to find that Zn2+-chelating AKe variants reacted with DTNB under native conditions (Fig. 3). The kinetics of the reaction with DTNB of these mutants was fitted to a single exponential equation. Over 0.5 mm DTNB, the values of k obs(5.10−3 s−1 for AKeC4, 7.10−3s−1 for AKeHC3 and 14.10−3 s−1 for AKeC3T) were practically independent on the concentration of thiol reagent. Thus, the first order process might reflect the dissociation rate of the AKe-Zn2+ complex. AK­Zn2+⇋Zn2++AKe→DTNBAK*Equation 1 As preincubation of AKeC4 with ZnCl2 did not affect the k obs (data not shown), one might assume that difference in affinity for metal is primarily due to the dissociation rate constant for protein-metal complex. The reactivity toward DTNB of the double substituted species of AKe was relevant for the structural changes into the LID domain of the bacterial enzyme. Thus, the HSC2variant reacted with DTNB under denaturing conditions. This means that Cys146 and Cys149 in this mutant are not exposed to the solvent and do not form a disulfide bridge as might be expected. On the other hand, the C2DT variant easily forms an intramolecular disulfide bridge, as suggested by its lack of reactivity toward DTNB both under nondenaturing and denaturing conditions. An even more complicated behavior was found with CSDC and HC2T forms of AKe, both of which were inactivated during the purification. Under nondenaturing conditions, 1.3–1.6 mol of SH/mol of enzymes were titrated with DTNB, indicating that the extra thiol groups were free and accessible. The observed inactivation of these species of AKe is likely due to structural deformation of the LID domain, which propagates to the CORE of the molecule. In preliminary experiments, different proteins were heated for 10 min at various temperatures between 40 and 80 °C, after which the residual enzyme activity was determined. The wild-type AKe and the C3T, CSDT, HCDT, and HSDC mutants were half-inactivated at temperature between 51 and 54 °C; the C4 and HC3 variants exhibited a higher thermal stability (half-inactivation at 65 and 58 °C, respectively) than the wild-type AKe, whereas the C2DT mutant was less resistant (half-inactivation at 46 °C). The thermal stability of the C4 and HC3variants was further examined by microcalorimetry. The excess heat capacity curve for the wild-type AKe, C4, and HC3 mutants is shown in Fig. 4. The Tm values (63 and 55.7 °C, respectively, instead of 51.8 °C for the wild-type enzyme) were reproducible within 0.1 °C. Inspection of Fig. 4 suggests that, at least under the conditions of the calorimetric experiments, the cooperativity of the denaturation process decreases significantly in the case of C4 mutant. A detailed analysis of structural and energetic properties of this variant is described in a companion study (20Burlacu-Miron S. Perrier V. Gilles A.-M. Pistotnik E. Craescu C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19102-19107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis was used as a test of conformational changes in AKe induced by various amino acid substitutions. Inactivation of the bacterial enzyme by TPCK-trypsin followed first order kinetics (7Perrier V. Surewicz W.K. Glaser P. Martineau L. Craescu C.T. Fabian H. Mantsch H.H. Bârzu O. Gilles A.-M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9960-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The triple and quadruple Cys mutants of AKe showed similar or slightly higher resistance against trypsin digestion (t½ between 26 and 40 min) as compared with the wild-type enzyme. The other modified variants of AKe, except the HCDT mutant, exhibited a much lower resistance to proteolysis (t½ < 3 min). Sequence analysis of the proteolytic fragments indicated that131R—V132 and141K—F142 bonds located into the LID domain became sensible to the attack by trypsin; the 14-kDa fragment accumulated upon proteolysis corresponds to the segment 1–131 of the molecule (Fig. 5). TableII shows the kinetic parameters of wild-type AKe, compared with two zinc-containing variants. The K m for nucleotide substrates was similar for the three variants of bacterial enzyme, and excess of AMP (above 0.3 mm) inhibited the activity of all forms at a similar extent. It should be mentioned that removal of metal ion did not affect the phosphorylating activity of apoAKeC4 or apoAKeHC3, confirming that zinc does not participate in the kinase activity.Table IIComparative kinetic parameters of wild-type (WT) AKe, AKeC4, and AKeHC3EnzymeK m(ADP)V max (ADP)K m(ATP)K m(AMP)V max (ATP, AMP)μmμmole/min/mgμmμmole/min/mgAKe (WT)9260551381020AKeC4664954231850AKeHC3755906134960K m (ADP) and V max (ADP) were determined from plots of 1/v versus 1/ADP2, which assumes that the two molecules of ADP bind to the enzyme with the same affinity. The apparent K m for AMP and for ATP was determined at a single fixed concentration of cosubstrates (1 mm ATP and 0.2 mm AMP). TheV max (ATP, AMP) was obtained by extrapolating the reaction rates for infinite concentrations of ATP and AMP and assuming that the concentration of one nucleotide substrate does not affect the apparent K m for the second nucleotide substrate.

Zinc in proteins is responsible for a wide range of functions (21Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 22Vallee B.L. Auld D.S.

The design of zinc binding sites generates proteins with new interesting properties (25Regan L. Clarke N.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10878-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Regan L.

Biol. 1995; 2: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The fact that zinc is a structural component of AKs from Gram-positive bacteria (6Gilles A.-M. Glaser P. Perrier V. Meier A. Longin R. Sebald M. Maignan L. Pistotnik E. Bârzu O. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 520-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to create a similar metal site in the enzyme from Gram-negative species. As shown here, the presence of three or four cysteine residues in the consensus sequence126Cys-X 2-Cys-X 16-Cys-X 2-Cys149led to a zinc binding site in E. coli AK. Moreover, a significant increase in thermostability of the C4 variant as compared with the wild-type AKe was observed. The crystal structure of AKe shows that the LID domain forms a single distorted antiparallel β-sheet, two turns and one loop structure (29Müller C.W. Schlauderer G.J. Reinstein J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1996; 4: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The β-sheet is stabilized by hydrogen backbone interactions and attractive forces between few side chains inside the β-sheet. The four amino acids (His126, Ser129, Asp146, and Thr149) replaced by cysteine residues in the mutagenized protein belong to this hydrogen binding network (Fig. 6). Three additional amino acid side chains (Arg131, Glu151, and Tyr133) stabilize the network of hydrogen bonds by connecting the β-sheet segments in a sandwich-like structure. In the LID domain of adenylate kinase from Gram-positive bacteria, Zn2+ which is held by cysteine residues seems to substitute efficiently the hydrogen bond network (30Schlauderer G.J. Schulz G.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of adenylate kinase from B. stearothermophilus (entry 1.Zip in the Protein Data Bank) confirms this observation. Metal chelation not only preserves the above mentioned network but also enhanced the thermal stability of the protein. As the catalytic properties of the C4 and C3 containing variants of AKe are conserved, the zinc-chelating LID domain of the protein conserves also intact the ability to rotate and to move like a solid block on the ATP-binding pocket. In other words, the overall conformation of this domain remains intact, in agreement with circular dichroism and NMR structural analysis (20Burlacu-Miron S. Perrier V. Gilles A.-M. Pistotnik E. Craescu C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19102-19107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The biochemical characteristics of the others variants of AKe might be also viewed in the light of hydrogen bond network located into the LID domain. The double mutants with vicinal thiols (C2DT and HSC2) conserve over 65% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme. On the contrary the two mutants, where each Cys residue is located on one side of the sandwich-like structure (HC2T and CSDC), are greatly affected in their activity. The loss of activity was independent on disulfide bridge formation as in the latter cases the SH groups are free. Among the Cys-monosubstituted variants, the most conservative substitution concerns Ser129. The S129C mutant exhibited similar structural and catalytic properties with the wild-type enzyme and with another AKe mutant (S129F) previously described by Haase et al. (31Haase G.H.W. Brune M. Reinstein J. Pai E.F. Pingoud A. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This last mutation, however, is conditionally lethal, and the bacteria do not survive at 42 °C. It was concluded that AKe might be involved in other essential cellular functions, independent of phosphotranferase activity, such as phospholipid synthesis. This attractive hypothesis still awaits for experimental proofs. All other single Cys variants (except HCDT form) of the AKe, although active and with similar thermal stability as the wild-type enzyme, exhibited a considerably lower resistance against trypsin digestion. In other words, despite the fact that the single amino acid substitutions were “conservative” in terms of hydrogen bond formation, some subtle conformational changes into the LID domain occur, yielding proteins with higher susceptibility to proteolytic digestion. In conclusion, this study highlighted the importance of some key residues into the LID domain of the AKe. Quadruple and triple Cys mutations stabilized the protein by chelation with zinc. Double mutants are the most exposed to conformational changes leading to inactivation, irrespective of the presence or absence of disulfide bridges. All single Cys mutants are active but only one (HCDT) conserves the stability of the wild-type protein. We thank O. Bârzu, C. T. Craescu, H. Sakamoto, and C.

Whereas signal peptides have been extensively studied, the molecular details of their interactions with components involved in targeting, such as SRP, 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; HB, hydrophobic index; AEP, alkaline extracellular protease; endo H, endoglycosidase H; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. are still unclear (Ref. 1Zheng N.

They are generally 15–30-amino acids long (for eukaryotes) and located at the N terminus. Signal peptides distinguish proteins that will enter the secretory pathway from those that will not. Although there is no sequence conservation between signal peptides, they have definite similarities and can be divided into regions. There usually is a net positive charge near the N-terminal end (n-region) followed by a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids (h-region) and a more polar C-terminal region usually containing the signal peptide cleavage site. Studies of mutated and synthetic signal peptides show that the degree of hydrophobicity affects the efficiency of translocation (for examples, see Refs. 4Ryan J.P. Duncan M.C. Bankaitis V.A.

Sambrook J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2905-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the wild type signal peptide did not interact in vitro with mammalian SRP, but a mutated form in which both glycines in the hydrophobic stretch were converted to leucines did. Recently, it was demonstrated that the average hydrophobicity of S. cerevisiae signal peptides is an important determinant of whether a protein is targeted by the SRP-dependent or -independent pathway (9Ng D.T.W. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). For proteins targeted by an SRP-independent pathway, the average hydrophobicity for 12 residues after the last positively charged residue of the n-region (HB12) is around 2.0 or less. For proteins targeted primarily by an SRP-dependent pathway, the HB12 values are significantly higher, around 3.0 or more. A kinetic partitioning model has been proposed to explain SRP-dependence of protein translocation (1Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 849-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One important factor in the partitioning is the affinity of the signal peptide for SRP which depends upon the primary sequence, hydrophobicity, and conformational propensities favoring formation of a productive complex with SRP (1Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 849-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For isolated signal peptides, β-structure and random or unordered structure are favored in aqueous solution and α-helix in nonpolar environments (see Ref. 3Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that short polypeptides are conformationally flexible (3Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, there is no example where a change of conformation/orientation, independent of average hydrophobicity, affects choice of targeting pathways. AEP secreted by the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is primarily translocated by a cotranslational SRP-dependent pathway (10Matoba S. Fukayama J. Wing R.A. Ogrydziak D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4904-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Yaver D.S. Matoba S. Ogrydziak D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The first AEP precursor (55 kDa) detected in pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiments is already translocated. Synthesis of this precursor is preferentially decreased at nonpermissive temperature in a strain containing the scr1–1 SRP RNA mutation, suggesting that at a minimum SRP has a role in AEP synthesis and probably in targeting. However, no untranslocated AEP precursor is detected in srp54Δ cells (12Lee I.H. Ogrydziak D.M. Yeast. 1996; 13: 499-513Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These differing results may be explained by a longer time for adaptation for srp54Δ cells and possibly by the instability of the untranslocated wild type AEP precursor. In any case, it appears that AEP preferentially uses the SRP-dependent pathway, but it can be targeted by the SRP-independent pathway. The P17M AEP mutation (Pro to Met at the second amino acid after the signal peptide cleavage site) results in SRP-independent posttranslational translocation (11Yaver D.S. Matoba S. Ogrydziak D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For P17M, the earliest precursor (53 kDa) detected in pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiments is not translocated. Levels of P17M AEP precursors are not affected by thescr1–1 mutation, suggesting that P17M AEP does not interact with SRP. This change in targeting pathway was unexpected given that the P17M mutation does not affect signal peptide length or average hydrophobicity. In this manuscript, we confirm that the rate of translocation can be increased and SRP-dependent targeting at least partially restored by increasing the hydrophobicity of a signal peptide. Our novel finding is that targeting pathway preference can be altered by mutations that have little or no effect on signal peptide hydrophobicity. Thus, some factor(s) other than hydrophobicity affects interactions of signal peptides with SRP. Computer models of the signal peptides are consistent with both the conformation/orientation and hydrophobicity of a signal peptide affecting its interactions with SRP and consequently the targeting pathway for translocation. Probably, these effects were observable only because the AEP signal peptide is short and has low average hydrophobicity for a yeast protein using the SRP-dependent pathway.

Skim milk (SKM) plates were used for detection of AEP activity (17Ogrydziak D.M. Demain A.L. Tannenbaum S.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), was used for site-directed mutagenesis. For A12P/P17M, primer 5′-TTACTATTCTCACTCCCGTTCTGG CCGCT-3′ was used to convert Ala12 (GCC) of P17M to Pro12(CCC). For T8L T11L P17M, primer 5′-CGCTACCGCCTTTCTGATTCTCCTGGCCGTTCTGGCCGCTATGCT-3′ was used to convert Thr8 (ACT) and Thr11 (ACT) of P17M to Leu8 (CTG) and Leu11 (CTG). For T8L T11L A12P/P17M, 5′-CGCTACCGCCTTTCTGATTCTCCTGCCCGTTCTGGCCGC-3′ was used to convert Thr8 (ACT), Thr11 (ACT), and Ala12 (GCC) of P17M to Leu8 (CTG), Leu11 (CTG), and Pro12 (CCC). For A6L F7L T8L T11L A12P/P17M, primer 5′-CAATGAAGCTCGCTACCCTCCTTCTGATTCTCCTGCCGG-3′ was used to convert Ala6 (GCC) and Phe7 (TTT) of T8L T11L A12P P17M to Leu6 (CTC) and Leu7 (CTT). For L L A6L F7L T8L T11L A12P/P17M, primer 5′-CAATGAAGCTCGCTACCCTCCTGCTCTTCTGATTCTC(A/C)(C/T) (G/T)-3′ was used to add two leucines (CTGCTC) to A6L F7L T8L T11L A12P/P17M between Leu6 and Leu7. For A6L F7L T8L T11L A12P/P17M 5′-CGGCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGG-3′ was used to convert EcoRV back to EcoRI. For the remaining mutagenesis, the Trans-oligo EcoRI/EcoRV 5′-CGGCCAGTGATATCGAGCTCGG-3′ (CLONTECH) was used. For site-directed mutagenesis altered versions of the 1.7-kilobase pairSphI/XbaI XPR2 fragment in pUC13 were mutagenized and cloned into SphI/XbaI cut pIMR100 (URA3 in SalI and XPR2 inEcoRI/HindIII sites of pBR322), and the plasmids cut with MluI to target in the promoter region ofxpr2-ΔA in SMY2. A6L F7L T8L P17M and A6L F7L T8L T11L A12P/P17M and A12P/P17M were similarly targeted in DY63-ΔXPR2 and DY66-ΔXPR2. Ura+ transformants were plated on 5-FOA medium to select for Ura− loop-outs. Replacement of xpr2-ΔA by the mutagenized version of XPR2 was confirmed by Southern blotting. Pulse-chase labeling with [3H]leucine, disruption of cells, immunoprecipitation of cell extracts with AEP antibody, trichloroacetic acid precipitation of extracellular samples, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography are based on previously described procedures (10Matoba S. Fukayama J. Wing R.A. Ogrydziak D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4904-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated samples were digested with endo H as described previously (11Yaver D.S. Matoba S. Ogrydziak D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA sequencing was done by the dideoxy method using the Sequenase Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [35S]dATP (21Chen E.Y. Seeburg P.H. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1985; 4: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). The normalized STA PRIFT hydrophobicity scale was used to calculate HB for lengths of 12 or 16 amino acids (22Cornette J.L. Cease K.B. Maargalit H. Spouge J.L. Berzofsky J.A. DeList C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 659-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) starting with the first amino acid following the last positively charged residue of the n-region. Using SignalP, it was determined that all the mutated N-terminal sequences were still predicted to be signal peptides (23Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4941) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions were done using the Chou-Fasman (24Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar) and Robson-Garnier (25Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar) methods, as implemented by MacVector 5.0 (Oxford Molecular Group, Oxford, UK), and Predict Protein (26Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Models of signal peptides were generated using the Biopolymer module of the InsightII (95.0.6) Molecular Modeling System from Biosym/Molecular Simulations (San Diego, CA). Model polypeptide structures were constructed in either the right-handed α-helix or extended forms using the CVFF force field. The Discovery module was used for energy minimization and dynamic simulations. First, a 1000 step energy minimization, then a 500 step dynamic simulation at 600 K, and finally another 1000 step energy minimization were done in vacuo. The polypeptide was SOAKed to simulate water as the solvent, and a final 1000 step energy minimization was done. Unlike wild type AEP, P17M AEP is translocated posttranslationally in an SRP-independent manner (11Yaver D.S. Matoba S. Ogrydziak D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For wild type AEP, the precursor detected at the earliest time point in pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiments with brief labeling times (45 s) is the 55-kDa translocated AEP precursor (Fig. 1 a) (10Matoba S. Fukayama J. Wing R.A. Ogrydziak D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4904-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For P17M AEP, little or no 55-kDa precursor is detected at the earliest time point (Fig. 1 b). The P17M AEP 53-kDa precursor contains the signal peptide and lacks N-linked carbohydrate (suggesting it is not translocated), and it quantitatively chases into the 55-kDa precursor (11Yaver D.S. Matoba S. Ogrydziak D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The P17M AEP 55-kDa precursor, like wild type AEP 55-kDa precursor, begins with Ala16 (therefore it lacks the signal peptide), contains 2 kDa of N-linked carbohydrate, and is protected in protease-protection experiments, suggesting that it is translocated (11Yaver D.S. Matoba S. Ogrydziak D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus the relative amounts of the 53- and 55-kDa AEP precursors at earliest time points reflect the relative usage of the posttranslational and cotranslational targeting pathways. No mature AEP is detected intracellularly for P17M (Fig. 1 a) and several other versions of AEP (see below) because it appears that transit of any protein containing the P17M mutation is delayed in the ER. Therefore, it takes significantly longer than for wild type for labeled mature AEP to appear intracellularly and then in the extracellular medium. 2S. Matoba and D. M. Ogrydziak, unpublished data. Hydrophobicity of the wild type AEP signal peptide is relatively low (HB12 of 2.15; TableI) and closer to HB12 values for S. cerevisiae proteins using an SRP-independent targeting pathway (9Ng D.T.W. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We attempted to target P17M AEP by an SRP-dependent pathway by increasing the hydrophobicity of the signal peptide. The T8L P17M signal peptide has increased hydrophobicity (HB12 of 2.78), but it was still translocated posttranslationally.2 For A6L F7L T8L P17M (HB12 of 3.34), both 53-kDa untranslocated and 55-kDa translocated precursors were detected at the earliest time points with the 55-kDa precursor predominating,2 suggesting that increasing the hydrophobicity of the signal peptide resulted in primarily cotranslational translocation (see below). For T8L T11L P17M (HB12 of 3.41), the translocation pattern resembled that of wild type AEP, although AEP precursor levels were decreased significantly (see below). These results show, as shown previously by others, that hydrophobicity of the signal peptide is an important factor in determining the choice of targeting pathway.Table IMode of translocation and predicted hydrophobicity values for wild type AEP, P17M AEP, and versions of P17M AEP with signal peptide mutationsVersion of AEPHB (12Lee I.H.

CT, cotranslational; PT, posttranslational. The reason for the change from SRP-dependent targeting for wild type AEP to SRP-independent for P17M AEP was unclear because the P17M mutation was not in the signal peptide, and the hydrophobicity of the region actually slightly increased (HB16 value changed from 2.15 to 2.26) (Table I). Because prolines are known to cause kinks and to disrupt secondary structure (27Vanhoof G. Goossens F. De Meester I. Hendriks D. Scharpe S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), the P17M mutation might have a significant effect on the signal peptide's conformation/orientation. If P17M results in SRP-independent posttranslational translocation because it changes the conformation/orientation of the signal peptide, then it might be possible to restore SRP-dependent cotranslational translocation by reconforming/reorienting the signal peptide. Therefore, we constructed A12P/P17M. The predominant precursor in A12P/P17M at the earliest time point in a pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiment was 55 kDa (Fig. 2 a). No 53-kDa untranslocated precursor was detected, but there was a 51-kDa precursor. The mobility of both bands was increased by treatment with endo H (Fig. 2 b), indicating they contained N-linked carbohydrate, consistent with translocation into the ER. The HB12 for A12P/P17M AEP (1.95) is slightly less than for P17M AEP (2.15). Thus the effects of the A12P change cannot be explained by an increase in hydrophobicity. The P17M mutation adversely affects production of AEP activity as shown by smaller zones of clearing on skim milk agar plates compared with wild type (Fig. 3). Although A12P/P17M AEP was translocated more rapidly than P17M AEP, production of AEP activity decreased (Fig. 3). To distinguish between faster SRP-independent translocation and SRP-dependent translocation, the A12P/P17M mutation was moved into scr1–1and SCR1 backgrounds. In these strains, both chromosomal copies of the SRP RNA genes are deleted; the only functional copy of an SRP RNA gene is on an ARS/CEN plasmid (11Yaver D.S. Matoba S. Ogrydziak D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The scr1–1mutation results in temperature sensitivity for growth. For wild type AEP, after a shift to nonpermissive temperature, no untranslocated AEP precursors were detected, but the level of translocated 55-kDa precursor was preferentially decreased in the scr1–1background (11Yaver D.S. Matoba S. Ogrydziak D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Levels of P17M AEP precursors were similar in the two backgrounds, consistent with P17M AEP and SRP not interacting (11Yaver D.S. Matoba S. Ogrydziak D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The preferential decrease in the level of the 55-kDa translocated AEP precursor in scr1–1 after the shift from 23 to 33 °C in A12P/P17M (Fig. 4 a) demonstrates that SRP-dependent translocation had at least been partially restored. Both the change from SRP-dependent translocation for wild type AEP to SRP-independent translocation for P17M AEP without a decrease in hydrophobicity and the change from SRP-independent translocation for P17M AEP back to SRP-dependent for A12P/P17M AEP without an increase in hydrophobicity prove that hydrophobicity cannot be the only factor determining the choice between these targeting pathways. Given that both changes involve deletion or addition of a proline, conformation/orientation may be an important factor in signal peptide SRP-interactions. For A6L F7L T8L P17M in the SCR1 background at 23 °C, there was more 55-kDa than 53-kDa precursor at the earliest time point (Fig. 4 b). The scr1–1 mutation slows growth at 23 °C, and a decrease in A6L F7L T8L P17M AEP precursor levels was found (Fig. 4 b). After a shift to 33 °C in thescr1–1 background, the levels of A6L F7L T8L P17M AEP precursors were further decreased.2 Both results indicate that SRP-dependent targeting had been at least partially restored. Because prolines alter the direction of polypeptide chains, the original hypothesis was that the P17M mutation changed the orientation of the signal peptide so that it no longer interacted with SRP and that the A12P/P17M combination restored the wild type orientation to some extent. Wild type AEP, P17M AEP, A12P/P17M AEP, and A6L F7L T8L P17M AEP peptides were modeled. The PredictProtein program predicted α-helical structures—from Ala4 to Leu14 for wild type and extending to Leu18 or Ala19 for the three proteins lacking Pro17. The Robson-Garnier method predicted α-helical structure from Ile9 to Ala38 for all four peptides. Predictions by the Chou-Fasman method differed—α-helical structure from Met1 to Leu18 for wild type extending to Ala22 for P17M AEP and A6L F7L T8L P17M AEP. For A12P/P17M AEP, the α-helical structure only extends from Pro12 to Ala22, and sheet is predicted from Lys2 to Val13. The peptides modeled as α-helices did not show much difference in overall shape (not shown). However, shapes of peptides modeled in the extended form were clearly different. Wild type AEP and A12P/P17M AEP peptides are kinked, shaped like a bow, whereas P17M AEP and A6L F7L T8L P17M AEP peptides are more linear, i.e. they would fit in a cylinder with a smaller diameter (Fig. 5). Although wild type AEP and A12P/P17M AEP peptides are of similar shape, if the C- or N-terminal amino acids are aligned, the central sections of the peptides do not overlap but head off in different directions, like mirror images of each other. The correlation of targeting pathway choice with predicted peptide structure suggests a model in which (i) kinked polypeptides with a larger radius of gyration interact more readily with SRP and (ii) increases in average hydrophobicity increase the affinity for SRP sufficiently that interactions with more linear signal peptides can occur. For T8L T11L P17M (HB12 of 3.41), an AEP precursor with similar mobility on SDS-PAGE as wild type 55-kDa translocated precursor (data not shown) predominated at the earliest time point (Fig. 6 a). It contained 2 kDa of N-linked carbohydrate, consistent with it being translocated (data not shown). Although total counts incorporated were similar to other strains, the levels of intracellular precursor were quite low. Little or no mature labeled AEP (data not shown) or AEP activity (Fig. 3) was secreted. The model that signal peptides with relatively low average hydrophobicity must be kinked for interaction with SRP does not account for decrease in the level of T8L T11L P17M AEP, and there are some changes in targeting pathways that are difficult to explain using this model. One example is T8L T11L A12P/P17M. The addition of the A12P mutation to T8L T11L P17M increased synthesis (Fig. 6 b) and restored production of AEP to P17M-like levels (Fig. 3). The average hydrophobicity decreased slightly (3.41 to 3.21), but the value was still above 3.0. With the combination of high average hydrophobicity and a kinked signal peptide, we expected SRP-dependent translocation. Instead, the translocation pattern changed from largely cotranslational to posttranslational. Additional changes A6L and F7L increase the average hydrophobicity to 3.79, and as expected, translocation of A6L F7L T8L T11L A12P/P17M AEP was largely cotranslational (Fig. 6 c); AEP production decreased slightly (Fig. 3). Difficult to explain is why addition of two Leu amino acids between positions 5 and 6, which increased the average hydrophobicity to 3.88, resulted in an increase in posttranslational translocation, so that about half of L L A6L F7L T8L T11L A12P/P17M used this pathway (Fig. 6 d), and in substantial decreases in AEP precursor levels (Fig. 6 d) and in secretion of AEP activity (Fig. 3). No untranslocated AEP precursor was detected in A12P/P17M. The AEP-related material running near mAEP in the very early time points in Fig. 2 a are possibly degradation products suggesting that A12P/P17M AEP untranslocated precursor is unstable, but untranslocated precursors were readily detected for P17M AEP and several other precursors containing the P17M mutation. The 51-kDa AEP precursor found in A12P/P17M had not been detected previously. It containsN-linked carbohydrate suggesting that it has been translocated, and it probably is a degradation product of the 55-kDa translocated precursor. An important finding was that levels of translocated A12P/P17M AEP precursors were significantly reduced in thescr1–1 background. Decreases in translocated AEP precursor have been attributed to maintenance of translational arrest (11Yaver D.S. Matoba S. Ogrydziak D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, they may be because of translocation defects (because of instability of scr1–1 SRP) combined with instability of the untranslocated precursor. In either case, decreases in the levels of translocated precursors show an interaction of SRP with the A12P/P17M AEP precursor. The major finding of this study is that some factor besides average hydrophobicity must explain the differences in ER targeting pathways of wild type and A12P/P17M peptides compared with P17M and A6L F7L T8L P17M peptides. The identity of the additional factor(s) has not been firmly established. Some possibilities include amphiphilicity, hydrophobic moment, molecular hydrophobicity potential (28Brasseur R. Pillot T.

Sci. 1997; 22: 167-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), or a slowing of the rate of synthesis of some of the signal peptides allowing a longer time for interaction with SRP. Interestingly, helical wheel representations of the signal peptides revealed that all the most hydrophobic amino acids were clustered on one side of the wheel. But because the P17M mutation just made this cluster slightly more hydrophobic and the A12P mutation was in the middle of the cluster of less hydrophobic amino acids, it was not obvious how this would explain the changes in targeting. Molecular modeling suggested the attractive hypothesis that the conformation/orientation (position in space) of the signal peptide is an important factor. Perhaps, kinked polypeptides with a larger radius of gyration interact more readily with SRP. For bacterial signal peptides, usually change of an amino acid to proline, predicted to break up an α-helix, decreases export efficiency (see Refs. 29Bedouelle H. Bassford Jr., P.J. Fowler A.V. Zabin I. Beckwith J. Hofnung M. Nature. 1980; 285: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar and 30Fikes J.D. Bankaitis V.A. Ryan P. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2345-2351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a substitution for proline, predicted to allow restoration of an α-helix, increases export efficiency (31Emr S.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4599-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In these studies, translocation pathway choice was not examined. The predicted secondary structures for the AEP-related signal peptides were generally α-helical. There is evidence that signal peptides can assume α-helical configurations, but it may be that such short peptides do not have a stable secondary structure and assume both extended and α-helical configurations (3Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Many of the molecular details of the signal peptide/SRP interaction are unknown. What is the structure of the signal peptide in the ribosome tunnel and as it exits the tunnel? Are signal peptides relatively flexible? How does the signal peptide conformation/orientation change as protein synthesis progresses? SRP has some affinity for ribosomes in the absence of signal peptide, but it increases by orders of magnitude when the signal peptide appears (32Walter P. Ibrahimi I. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Current models have SRP cycling on and off of ribosomes during the translation elongation cycle and competing with NAC for sampling of nascent chains as they exit the ribosome (33Ogg S.C. Walter P. Cell. 1995; 81: 1075-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 34Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9433-9434Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Does SRP position itself precisely enough on the ribosome that the conformation/orientation (position in space) of the signal peptide can influence their interaction? How much of the AEP signal peptide must be exposed before there is an interaction, and at what lengths do interactions with SRP start to decrease and then become no longer significant? At physiological SRP concentrations, affinity of SRP for preprolactin signal peptide fell dramatically after chains reached a certain length (35Siegel V. Walter P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1769-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As found in other systems, hydrophobicity is an important factor in the AEP signal peptide/SRP interaction. The shape of the A6L F7L T8L P17M peptide is similar to that of the P17M peptide, but it is much more hydrophobic and uses the SRP-dependent targeting pathway. The increase in average hydrophobicity may increase the affinity for SRP so that even if the signal peptide and SRP are only rarely in close proximity the high affinity is sufficient for functional interactions to occur. The very low level of T8L T11L P17M AEP detected is probably because of a posttranscriptional effect such as decreased stability or synthesis, perhaps because of altered mRNA secondary structure. The most difficult result to explain by our model is for T8L T11L A12P/P17M AEP, which was translocated primarily posttranslationally, whereas T8L T11L P17M AEP and A12P/P17M AEP were translocated primarily co-translationally. Why addition of leucines to produce L L A6L F7L T8L T11L A12P/P17M should increase posttranslational translocation is unclear. A somewhat similar result was obtained in another study. As expected, results for L A6L F7L T8L P17M (HB12 of 3.37) were much like those for A6L F7L T8L P17M, more 55-kDa than 53-kDa precursor at the earliest time point.2Unexpectedly, for L L A6L F7L T8L P17M (HB12 of 3.42) translocation is predominately posttranslational.2 Based on predicted signal peptide cleavage sites, the addition of the leucines increases the lengths of the signal peptides. Perhaps, it is relevant that for pseudorabies virus glycoprotein gC, making the signal peptides too hydrophobic adversely affected export efficiency (36Tomilo M. Wilkinson K. Ryan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32016-32021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that a model involving only average hydrophobicity and kinkiness is too simplistic to accurately predict choice of targeting pathway in all cases. Usually for secretion of heterologous proteins from Y. lipolytica, parts or all the XPR2 prepro-region have been used to direct the protein into the secretory pathway and to provide for accurate processing. How the efficiency of secretion is affected by the mode-of-translocation is unknown. Less P17M AEP is secreted than wild type AEP (Fig. 3), but this could be because of folding problems in the ER.2 If a wild type AEP signal peptide/mature foreign protein fusion is constructed and if, unlike AEP, the foreign protein does not have a proline near its N terminus, then the prediction of our model is that this fusion would be targeted posttranslationally as for P17M. In this case, how readily the foreign protein can be translocated posttranslationally might determine the productivity of the construct. The rice amylase signal peptide was more efficient than the AEP signal peptide for rice amylase secretion (37Park C.S. Chang C.C. Kim J.-Y. Ogrydziak D.M. Ryu D.D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6876-6881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have produced bovine β-lactoglobulin using the wild type AEP signal peptide 3M. Huang and D. M. Ogrydziak, unpublished data. but did not try using the β-lactoglobulin signal peptide. Neither mature β-lactoglobulin nor rice amylase has a proline near the N terminus, but β-lactoglobulin is much smaller (18 versus 42 kDa) and may be more readily translocated posttranslationally. If our model holds for S. cerevisiae SRP/signal peptide interactions, then for signal peptides with low hydrophobicity (targeted by the SRP-independent pathway) the sequences just downstream should lack prolines. Otherwise these signal peptides would be predicted to interact to some extent with SRP. The prediction holds for four of the five S. cerevisiae proteins for which this information is available: PDI (no prolines in 22 amino acids), CPY (0/20), Gas1p (0/22), and Suc2p (0/19). MFα-factor (HB <2.0) with an internal proline at position 4 and one at position 21, the second amino acid after the cleavage site, does not fit the prediction. The short length and relatively low hydrophobicity of the AEP signal peptide may have made it possible to see changes in choice of targeting pathways without changes in hydrophobicity. If the AEP signal peptide had an HB12 >3.0 like SRP-dependent signal peptides in S. cerevisiae, then most likely one would not see the P17M effect (change from SRP-dependent to SRP-independent targeting) because the resulting signal peptide would probably behave like the A6L F7L T8L P17M signal peptide which was targeted largely by the SRP-dependent pathway. The model that signal peptides with low hydrophobicity must be kinky to be recognized by SRP is attractive but not proven. What has been proven is that some other factor(s) besides average hydrophobicity is also important in choice of the targeting pathway for translocation."

In this report we describe a key intermediate in the insertion of one such protein, photosystem II subunit W (PSII-W). A single mutation in the terminal cleavage site partially blocks processing and leads to the formation of an intermediate-size protein in the thylakoid membrane during chloroplast import assays. This protein is in the form of a loop structure: the N and C termini are exposed on the stromal face, whereas the cleavage site has been translocated into the lumen. In this respect the insertion of this protein resembles that of M13 procoat, which also adopts a loop structure during insertion, and we present preliminary evidence that a similar mechanism is used by another thylakoid protein, PSII-X. However, whereas the negatively charged region of procoat is translocated by an apparently electrophoretic mechanism using the ΔμH+, the corresponding region of PSII-W is equally acidic but insertion is ΔμH+independent. We furthermore show that neutralization of this region has no apparent effect on the insertion process.

We propose that a central element in this insertion mechanism is a loop structure whose formation is driven by hydrophobic interactions. The biogenesis of biological membranes requires the synthesis of numerous hydrophobic proteins and their insertion into membrane bilayers, and intensive efforts have been made to understand the mechanisms involved. The majority of bacterial, chloroplast, and mitochondrial membrane proteins are inserted post-translationally, and interest has centered on the mechanisms by which these proteins are initially maintained in a soluble form, and how the hydrophobic regions are then transferred from an aqueous milieu into the apolar regions of the membrane bilayer. Some elements of the insertion events have been characterized in detail, one example being the influence of positive charges on overall topology, since these residues have a strong tendency to remain on the cis side of the membrane (1Von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It has also proved possible to recognize two broad categories of insertion mechanism, which can be regarded as “assisted” and “unassisted” according to whether protein translocation machinery is relied upon. In bacteria, for example, the secretion (Sec) apparatus used for the translocation of periplasmic proteins is also required for the insertion of some membrane proteins (2Gebert J.F. Overhoff B.

In addition, another element of the export machinery, signal recognition particle (SRP), 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; TPP, thylakoidal processing peptidase; PSII, photosystem II. 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; TPP, thylakoidal processing peptidase; PSII, photosystem II. is involved in the insertion of a range of membrane proteins (6De Gier J-W.L.

Other proteins, however, are integrated by Sec-independent mechanisms and these may well insert spontaneously into the plasma membrane (9Kuhn A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Andersson H. von Heijne G.

However, whereas the overall requirements have been detailed for several membrane proteins, the actual insertion mechanisms are poorly understood in most cases. In vitro reconstitution assays favored for the study of protein translocation have been of limited use because most hydrophobic proteins are inherently unstable in aqueous solution. Few proteins have been examined in genuine mechanistic detail, although the coat proteins of the M13 and Pf3 phages are notable exceptions that have been shown to integrate into theEscherichia coli membrane by Sec-independent, possibly spontaneous mechanisms (reviewed in Ref. 9Kuhn A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our knowledge of membrane protein insertion is particularly vague in the case of thylakoid proteins. Most thylakoid proteins are imported after synthesis in the cytosol, and at least four distinct pathways have been identified for their subsequent targeting into and across the thylakoid membrane (reviewed in Refs. 13Robinson C. Mant A. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 431-437Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar and 14Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Two of the pathways apply to thylakoid lumen proteins, which are imported by means of bipartite presequences containing envelope transit and thylakoid transfer signals in tandem. After import into the stroma, the transfer signal directs transport across the thylakoid membrane by either an ATP-dependent, Sec-related mechanism, or a very different mechanism that relies on the thylakoidal ΔpH. After translocation, the stromal intermediates are processed to the mature forms by a lumen-facing thylakoidal processing peptidase, TPP (15Kirwin P.M. Elderfield P.E. Williams R.S. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18128-18132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thylakoid transfer signals of these proteins are all similar in overall structure to bacterial signal peptides, but specify translocation by only one of these mechanisms (16Robinson C. Cai D. Hulford A. Brock I.W. Michl D. Hazell L. Schmidt I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Henry R. Kapazoglou A. McCaffery M. Cline K. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Two further pathways have been identified for integral thylakoid membrane proteins. The multispanning membrane protein, LHCP, is synthesized with an envelope transit signal only, and hence integrates into the thylakoid membrane by means of information contained in the mature protein (19Lamppa G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14996-14999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Viitanen P.V. Doran E.R. Dunsmuir P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15000-15007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The integration process requires GTP and a stromal homologue of the 54-kDa protein of signal recognition particles (21Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and is thus likely to be similar in certain respects to the SRP-dependent pathway identified in bacteria. However, a very different mechanism has been demonstrated for three other thylakoid proteins: subunit II of the integral CFocomponent of the thylakoidal ATP synthase (CFoII) and subunits X and W of photosystem II (PSII-X and PSII-W). These proteins are synthesized with bipartite presequences that strongly resemble typical Sec-type signal peptides (22Herrmann R.G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann G.S. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Lorkovic Z.J. Schröder W.P. Pakrasi H.B. Irrgang K-D. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), yet they integrate into thylakoid membranes in the absence of stromal factors, nucleoside triphosphates, or a ΔpH (25Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mild proteolysis of thylakoids blocks the Sec-, SRP-, and ΔpH-dependent mechanisms but has no effect on the insertion of CFoII, PSII-W, and PSII-X (26Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that they insert spontaneously into the thylakoid membrane. This particular insertion mechanism is highly unusual in that no other mainstream insertion process studied to date involves the use of cleavable signal peptides for “unassisted” membrane insertion, and M13 procoat is in fact the only other protein known to use this type of mechanism (see below). In this report we have analyzed this integration pathway in greater detail in order to elucidate mechanistic details of the membrane-insertion events. We describe a loop intermediate that is central to the insertion process and we present evidence that hydrophobic interactions are the driving force for insertion. Precursors ofArabidopsis thaliana PSII-W and PSII-X were synthesized by transcription in vitro of cDNA clones followed by translation of capped transcripts in the presence of [3H]leucine as described (24Kim S.J. Robinson D. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mutated forms were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis of cDNAs using an Amersham International kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Intact chloroplasts were prepared from leaves of 8–9-day-old pea seedlings (Pisum sativum, var. Feltham First) by Percoll pad centrifugation and used in import assays as described (24Kim S.J. Robinson D. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B.

Proteolysis of thylakoid membranes was carried out in 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2 (HM buffer) unless otherwise specified in the figure legends, using thylakoid suspensions at 1 mg/ml chlorophyll. Sonication involved the use of a sonicating water bath at 0 °C. Carbonate washing of thylakoids was carried out as detailed by Michl et al. (25Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The sequences of PSII-X proteins were extracted from data base entries for the plastid genomes ofOdontella sinensis, Cyanophora paradoxa, andPorphyra purpurea (accession numbers Z67753, U30821, andU38804, respectively). Pre-PSII-W and pre-PSII-X share overall structural similarities with M13 procoat and appear likewise to insert into their target membrane without the aid of translocation machinery. However, there are significant differences in terms of insertion requirements (see below) and we have set out to investigate the thylakoid proteins in greater detail. Our first aim was to determine whether the cleavable signal-type peptides of the thylakoid proteins are used for a similar purpose: the formation of a loop intermediate in which the hydrophobic region (H-domain) spans the membrane. This is probably the most important role of the M13 signal peptide and our priority was to determine whether such an intermediate is a core feature in the biogenesis of PSII-W and/or PSII-X. We addressed this question by inhibiting the cleavage step catalyzed by TPP (whose active site is in the thylakoid lumen; Ref. 15Kirwin P.M. Elderfield P.E. Williams R.S. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18128-18132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in order to probe the location and topology of this protein immediately prior to the final maturation step. Fig. 1 shows the structures of the relevant sections of both precursors, including the signal peptide and the mature region of the mature protein. TPP is known to depend on the presence of short-chain residues at the −3 to −1 positions in the substrate, relative to the processing site, and Ala at the −1 position is essential with even Ser and Gly unable to support efficient cleavage (28Shackleton J.B. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12152-12156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore introduced Thr at this position in both pre-PSII-W and pre-PSII-X, in the expectation that processing would be drastically affected without substantially altering the characteristics of the translocated region. The import characteristics of the PSII-W mutant (W/A78T) are shown in Fig. 2. The wild-type precursor protein is imported into the chloroplasts, processed to the mature size, and fractionation tests confirm that this polypeptide is located exclusively in the membrane fraction (lane T). Protease treatment of the thylakoid membranes (lane T+) results in digestion of the exposed C-terminal region (as found in previous studies on PSII-W (29Irrgang K-D. Shi L-X. Funk C. Schröder W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), and the production of a slightly smaller degradation product. The mutant protein, on the other hand, is converted to a mixture of mature- and intermediate-size proteins, the latter form presumably resulting from the action of stromal processing peptidase, which cleaves the envelope transit domains from most bipartite presequences. Importantly, this iPSII-W form is also found only in the thylakoid fraction and further tests show that it is completely resistant to carbonate extraction, because after this treatment both the intermediate and mature bands are recovered only in the pellet fraction (lane P). Since this procedure effectively removes extrinsic proteins from the thylakoid membrane (25Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we can exclude the possibility that the action of TPP is required for the insertion of this protein. Thermolysin treatment of the iPSII-W results in a mobility shift that is comparable to that of mature PSII-W, confirming that at least one section of the intermediate is exposed on the stromal face of the thylakoid membrane. The topology of the iPSII-W polypeptide was mapped by determining the accessibility of sites for trypsin and thermolysin cleavage. Fig. 1 shows that the PSII-W mature protein contains only a single basic residue which is located in the lumenal N-terminal region (Arg at position 5); the presequence contains many basic residues but these are all located prior to the H-domain in the signal peptide. In a loop structure these sites are predicted to be on the lumenal and stromal sides of the membrane, respectively. Fig. 3 A shows that trypsin cleaves iPSII-W to a smaller form that remains significantly larger than mature-size PSII-W; low concentrations of trypsin (e.g. 10 μg/ml) generate a mixture of iPSII-W and a smaller degradation product, whereas 25 μg/ml is sufficient to fully convert the iPSII-W to the degradation product. Trypsin therefore cleaves the N terminus of the iPSII-W signal peptide on the stromal surface of the membrane. A loop intermediate would also contain the C terminus of the mature protein on this face of the membrane, and Fig. 3 B shows that this is the case. The C terminus of mature PSII-W is exposed on the stromal face and the data in Fig. 2 showed that it is cleaved by thermolysin; Fig. 3 B shows that thermolysin also cleaves a small fragment from iPSII-W, generating a degradation product similar in mobility to that produced by trypsin (compare lanes Thand Tp). Significantly, incubation of iPSII-W with both thermolysin and trypsin generates a much smaller degradation product (lane Th/Tp) indicating that trypsin and thermolysin cleave at different ends of the molecule (the N and C termini, respectively).Lane Tp/son of Fig. 3 B provides final confirmation of a loop structure: thylakoids containing iPSII-W were incubated with trypsin and the thylakoids were sonicated to allow access of the protease to the lumenal side of the membrane. Both the mature PSII-W and the iPSII-W are almost quantitatively converted to a polypeptide that is smaller than mature PSII-W, indicating that cleavage has taken place after the Arg at position 5 in the mature protein, which must therefore be exposed on the lumenal side of the membrane. A similar approach was also taken to investigate the insertion of PSII-X because it is as yet unclear whether the three thylakoid proteins currently viewed as a group (CFoII, PSII-X, and PSII-W) actually insert by similar mechanisms. The cleavage site of pre-PSII-X was similarly mutated by the introduction of a Thr at the −1 position and the effects examined as for PSII-W. Fig. 4 shows that this mutation likewise inhibits processing by TPP although the effects are in fact more drastic; analysis of the thylakoid fraction following an import reaction shows that hardly any mature PSII-X is detectable, indicating that the action of TPP is almost totally blocked. Once again, an intermediate-size form (int) accumulates which is presumed to result from the action of stromal processing peptidase. This intermediate form is located exclusively in the thylakoid membrane showing that TPP action is not required for the insertion of PSII-X. Topology studies were carried out on the iPSII-X polypeptide but the results were not as clear-cut as those obtained with PSII-W. Thylakoids containing the imported, mature-size wild-type protein were incubated with thermolysin, Staphylococcus V8 protease (V8), a mixture of thermolysin/V8, and trypsin, but no cleavage was apparent (left-hand panel of Fig. 5). Apparently, only a small region of mature PSII-X protrudes into the stroma. Unfortunately, the membrane-bound intermediate form is also resistant to proteolysis as shown in the right-hand panel; thermolysin and trypsin fail to generate defined cleavage products, and only V8 of the proteases tested is able to cleave the protein. However, this takes place only at very high concentrations (200 μg/ml for 60 min) and some penetration into the lumen clearly occurs because the cleavage product (lane V) is similar in size to the mature protein. This presumably means that the V8 cleaves at one or both of the Glu residues in the C-terminal region of the signal peptide, just before the cleavage site (see Fig. 1). However, it is notable that this cleavage is much more efficient when the thylakoids are sonicated in the presence of V8 to allow complete access. Under these conditions the intermediate is quantitatively converted to the degradation product (lane Vs) providing evidence, albeit circumstantial, that this region is in the lumen. This would imply the formation of a loop intermediate as with PSII-W, but further tests will be required to confirm this point. Studies in bacteria have shown that two types of force can be instrumental in driving protein insertion. Hydrophobic forces appear to be important in all cases, reflecting the loss of free energy achieved by moving hydrophobic regions into the lipid bilayer, but electrophoretic forces are also vital in the insertion of both Pf3 coat protein and M13 procoat. In both cases, insertion depends on the ΔμH+ (positive outside) which is believed to drive the translocation of negatively charged residues across the membrane. The translocated regions of CFoII, pre-PSII-X, and pre-PSII-W are all similar to that of procoat in terms of charge: the N-terminal regions of mature coat protein, CFoII, and PSII-W contain net charges of −3, −3, and −2, respectively, and, although mature PSII-X contains no negative charges at the N terminus of the mature protein, the translocated region is nevertheless acidic due to the two Glu residues in the C-terminal domain of the signal peptide (see Fig. 1). Although the insertion of the thylakoid proteins is unaffected by dissipation of the thylakoidal ΔμH+ in each case (23Lorkovic Z.J. Schröder W.P. Pakrasi H.B. Irrgang K-D. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Kim S.J. Robinson D. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we deemed it important to determine whether insertion might be assisted by a smaller, standing charge difference across the thylakoid membrane that might be important in the insertion process even in the absence of a photosynthetically driven ΔμH+. This possibility was tested by mutating acidic residues in the translocated region of pre-PSII-W as shown in Fig. 1. In one of the mutants (W/E88Q) the net charge of this region was reduced to −1 and the second mutant, W/D82N,E83Q contained a neutral translocated region. Fig. 6 shows that both proteins are imported and efficiently inserted into the thylakoid membrane; the protease-treated chloroplasts contain only mature-size PSII-W which is located exclusively in the membrane fraction. The mutations therefore have no detectable effect on the import characteristics and we conclude that electrophoretic forces play no role in the insertion of this protein. CFoII, PSII-W, and PSII-X represent an unusual group of membrane proteins in that no other membrane protein, with the exception of M13 procoat, has been found to rely on a cleavable signal peptide for membrane insertion by a Sec- and SRP-independent mechanism. As shown in Fig. 1, the three thylakoid proteins share additional common features with procoat: each contains a single transmembrane span in the mature protein and the translocated regions are all negatively charged. It was thus unsurprising that initial models for the Sec-independent insertion of CFoII (25Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were based on the procoat insertion model, and this study has confirmed that in one fundamental respect the insertion of PSII-W does indeed resemble that of procoat. Both proteins adopt a loop intermediate during the insertion process, strongly suggesting that the function of the PSII-W signal peptide is to provide a second hydrophobic domain which, in concert with the transmembrane segment in the mature protein, is then able to drive the translocation of the hydrophilic intervening region into the thylakoid lumen. Interestingly, signal-type peptides appear also to form loop structures when directing soluble proteins across membranes by means of protein translocation systems (30Kuhn A. Kiefer D. Köhne C. Zhu H-Y. Tschanz W.R. Dalbey R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Fincher V. McCaffrey M. Cline K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The experimental evidence favoring a Sec/SRP-independent insertion mechanism (23Lorkovic Z.J. Schröder W.P. Pakrasi H.B. Irrgang K-D. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Kim S.J. Robinson D. Robinson C.

Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) is consistent with the unusual evolution of the signal peptides. Genes encoding PSII-X and CFoII have been identified in cyanobacteria and also within the plastid genomes of several eukaryotic algae/diatoms, such as O. sinensis andC. paradoxa. None of these cyanobacterial or plastid-encoded proteins is synthesized with a signal-type peptide, strongly suggesting that the signal peptides were acquired after the transfer of these genes to the nucleus in higher plants. This situation contrasts starkly with “genuine” Sec-type signal peptides such as those found in the precursors of lumenal proteins, because the cyanobacterial/plastid-encoded counterparts of these proteins are invariably synthesized with classical signal peptides. We therefore believe that the signal peptides of these membrane proteins differ from Sec-type signal peptides in terms of both function and origin. However, we can detect no large-scale structural differences among themature proteins that might explain why nuclear-encoded, imported proteins are now synthesized with signal peptides. Mature PSII-X proteins, for example, are structurally very similar in higher plants and cyanobacteria (see Fig. 1). Given these similarities, it may be simplistic to suggest that the signal peptide functions simply by providing a critical, additional hydrophobic segment, because the mature proteins in cyanobacteria and the above mentioned algae can clearly insert despite possessing only a single hydrophobic region. The only obvious difference concerns the charge distributions in the N-terminal regions; these regions are neutral in the cyanobacterial and plastid-encoded proteins whereas that of Arabidopsis PSII-X is basic due to the Lys at position 10. This could conceivably render the translocation process more difficult to the extent that the additional hydrophobic region is required to aid insertion. However, it is also possible that this unusual insertion mechanism has been forced on these proteins as a consequence of their more complex insertion pathway; the proteins may insert co-translationally in cyanobacteria, in which case the protein may never be free in the aqueous phase and insertion may be more favorable. It is even possible that the signal peptide renders the precursor protein more stable in solution, perhaps by forming a “helical hairpin” in which the signal peptide partially masks the hydrophobic character of the transmembrane segment. Structural studies on this type of precursor protein should prove instrumental in resolving these points. Although the insertion of these thylakoid proteins is reminiscent of M13 procoat insertion, there are equally significant differences in the mechanisms used. The first concerns the initial events in the insertion process. Gallusser and Kuhn (32Gallusser A. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have shown that electrostatic interactions play a critical role in the insertion of procoat, in which basic residues in both the extreme N and C termini bind to the negatively charged membrane surface; removal of either set of basic residues renders procoat wholly insertion incompetent. Like procoat, pre-CFoII contains positively charged N and C termini and a similar mechanism was considered possible for this protein (25Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal region of pre-PSII-W is extremely negatively charged (a series of five acidic residues follows the transmembrane section), precluding any electrostatic binding between this region and the membrane surface. Further tests are required to determine whether the basic N-terminal region plays any role through an electrostatic binding to the thylakoid surface. A second difference concerns the energetics of insertion. Most Sec-dependent bacterial proteins are at least partially dependent on the transmembrane potential for efficient insertion, but the best characterized Sec-independent proteins (M13 procoat and Pf3 coat) are entirely dependent on the ΔμH+(10Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Date T. Goodman J.M. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4669-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) In both cases this has been attributed to an essential role of the membrane potential in driving the translocation of negatively charged regions through the E. coli plasma membrane by an electrophoretic mechanism (34Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, dissipation of the thylakoidal ΔμH+ has essentially no effect on the insertion of CFoII, PSII-X, or PSII-W (23Lorkovic Z.J. Schröder W.P. Pakrasi H.B. Irrgang K-D. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the absence of any apparent role for electrophoretic forces, we propose that hydrophobic interactions between the H-domains in pre-PSII-W and the membrane interior are the primary driving force for membrane insertion. It must be emphasized at this point that similar forces are clearly crucial in the procoat insertion process, because mutant forms containing positively charged translocated regions can be inserted even in the absence of a ΔμH+ (35Kuhn A. Zhu H-Y. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2385-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our data show that the two systems have very different tolerances and it remains to be determined how such superficially similar translocated regions can be so potential dependent in E. coli but not in thylakoids. One possibility under consideration is that these findings reflect differences in the lipid compositions of the two membranes. The thylakoid membrane is most unusual in that galactolipids account for over 80% of membrane lipids, whereas phospholipids predominate in most membranes including those of E. coli. It has been proposed that one of the major thylakoid lipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, has a pronounced ability to form non-bilayer structures (36Gounaris K. Sen A. Brain A.P.R. Quinn P.J. Williams W.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 728: 129-139Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and we speculate that this property may facilitate translocation of polar regions across the thylakoid membrane. In general, the actual insertion events are poorly characterized for those proteins that insert without the benefit of proteinaceous translocation apparatus, and structural studies are clearly required for an understanding of the conformational changes taking place."
https://openalex.org/W2031487671,"In the nervous system of the marine molluskAplysia there are two protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, the Ca2+-activated PKC Apl I and the Ca2+-independent PKC Apl II. PKC Apl I, but not PKC Apl II is activated by a short-term application of the neurotransmitter serotonin. This may be explained by the fact that purified PKC Apl II requires a higher mole percentage of phosphatidylserine to stimulate enzyme activity than does PKC Apl I. In order to understand the molecular basis for this difference, we have compared the ability of lipids to interact with the purified kinases and with regulatory domain fusion proteins derived from the kinases using a variety of assays including kinase activity, phorbol dibutyrate binding, and liposome binding. We found that a C2 domain fusion protein derived from PKC Apl I binds to lipids constitutively, while a C2 domain fusion protein derived from PKC Apl II does not. In contrast, fusion proteins containing the C1 domains of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II showed only small differences in lipid interactions.

Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). This role of PKC has been well conserved over evolution with activation of PKC causing similar changes in vertebrate and invertebrate synapses (1Nishizuka Y. Shearman M.S. Oda T. Berry N.

U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2040-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The structure of PKCs has also been well conserved. Ca2+-activated PKCs (cPKCs) in vertebrates (α, β, and γ) and invertebrates (PKC Apl I inAplysia) have two C1 domains and a C2 domain. Ca2+-independent or novel PKCs (nPKCs) in vertebrates (δ, ε, η, and θ) and invertebrates (PKC Apl II in Aplysia) also have two C1 domains and a C2 domain. However, the C2 domain in these kinases is at the N-terminal side of the C1 domain and lacks several of the critical aspartic acids that are required for Ca2+ binding (7Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In cPKCs, the C2 domain confers the ability to bind to acidic lipids in the presence of Ca2+ ions, while the C1 domain confers the ability to bind to lipid in a diacylglycerol (DAG)-dependent manner (8Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). The DAG-dependent lipid binding to the C1 domain is specific for phosphatidylserine (PS) while binding to other lipids is independent of DAG (10Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The two lipid-binding domains act in concert to activate cPKCs by causing a conformational change leading to the release of kinase inhibition by the pseudosubstrate. In contrast to cPKCs, a detailed model for the activation of nPKCs has not been presented. Removing the C2 domain of PKCη does not affect substrate specificity or the ability to be activated by PIP2 or PIP3 (11Dekker L.V. McIntyre P. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19498-19504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Palmer R.H. Dekker L.V. Woscholski R. Le Good J.A. Gigg R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22412-22416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, removing the C2 domain of PKC Apl II reduces the levels of PS required for enzyme activation, suggesting that the C2 domain plays an inhibitory role (13Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As well, peptides derived from the C2 domains of both cPKCs and nPKCs act as isoform-specific dominant negative inhibitors in cells, suggesting that the physiological function of both kinases requires specific binding of factors to these domains (14Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 15Ron D. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21395-21398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C2 domains are thought to be important in the translocation of proteins to membranes (7Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 8Newton A.C. Curr.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Aplysia, short-term treatments with the facilitating transmitter 5-HT can translocate PKC Apl I to membranes, but not PKC Apl II (17Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, insulin can persistently translocate PKC Apl II, but not PKC Apl I to membranes (18Sossin W.S. Chen C.S. Toker A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the regulation of enzyme translocation is different in these two PKC isoforms, perhaps due to their distinct C2 domains. One way to determine the roles of C1 and C2 domains is to study these domains in isolation using fusion proteins containing one or both of these domains. These studies have illustrated that the C1 domains are sufficient to bind to phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu, a pharmacological analog of DAG) in a lipid-dependent manner, and that some C2 domains bind to lipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner (16Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E.

Furthermore, there is some evidence that these two domains may interact since addition of a C2 domain to a single C1 domain of PKCγ leads to a decrease in PDBu affinity (21Quest A.F. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20000-20012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a fusion protein containing both the C2 domain and C1 domains of PKC Apl II has a lower affinity for PDBu than a fusion protein containing only the C1 domains (23Pepio A. Sossin W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1256-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Small amounts of phosphatidic acid (PA) increase the affinity of the C2 domain containing construct for PDBu, suggesting that PA might act specifically to remove the effect of the C2 domain of PKC Apl II (23Pepio A. Sossin W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1256-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this paper we have examined lipid interactions of fusion proteins containing C1 or C2 domains of the cPKC Apl I and the nPKC Apl II, using either a direct liposome binding assay or measuring the ability of lipids to stimulate PDBu binding to the fusion proteins. We have compared these results to the ability of lipids to stimulate either PDBu binding or kinase activity of purified preparations of PKC Apl I, PKC Apl II, and PKC Apl II without its C2 domain. Our results indicate that the major difference between cPKCs and nPKCs is that lipids act through the C2 domain to enhance activity of cPKCs but not nPKCs. 4β-Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate was from LC Services; [3H]4β-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (19.6 Ci/mmol), NEN Life Science Products Inc.; 1,2-dipalmitoyl-l-3-phosphatidyl-[N-methyl-3H]choline (100 mCi/mg), Amersham, Oakville, ON, Canada; dioleoyl phosphatidylserine (PS), dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC), dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), dioleoyl phosphatidic acid (PA), and dioctylglycerol (DOG) were from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL; phosphatidylinositol (PI) (mostly linoleic and palmitic acid) from Sigma; Triton X-100 (Pierce); Sephacryl S-100 HR from Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden; prestained molecular weight markers, Amersham Corp., and trypsin from Worthington Biochemicals, Freehold, NJ. All other reagents were of the highest grade available. The generation of GST-Apl II-C1 and GST-Apl II-C2 has been described (23Pepio A. Sossin W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1256-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GST-Apl I C1 domain was made using polymerase chain reaction with VENT polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) from the plasmid expressing PKC Apl I. The 5′-primer was GGGATCCTTATGGAGAAGCGAGTCGCTAGGC and the 3′-primer was GGAATTCCTTGACAGCTCCTTTGATGA. The amplified product was cut withBamHI and EcoRI and inserted into pGEX-3X (Pharmacia) which had been cut with the same enzymes. This generated a fusion protein with PKC sequences beginning from the initiator methionine of PKC Apl I Met-Glu-Lys-Arg and ending with Gly-Ala-Val-Lys, which included the pseudosubstrate of PKC Apl I at the 5′-terminal and strand 1 of the C2 domain at the 3′-terminal. The pseudosubstrate in PKC Apl I is immediately after the initiator methionine and there is no V1 region in this kinase. Earlier constructs made with shorter boundaries did not produce stable fusion proteins. We had previously made a GST-Apl II-C1 construct including the pseudosubstrate and its behavior was identical to that of the construct without this domain (23Pepio A. Sossin W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1256-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For GST-Apl I-C2, an Eco47III fragment was excised from the PKC Apl I plasmid and inserted into pGEX-3X after cutting the vector with EcoRI and filling in with Klenow. The fusion protein contains PKC sequences beginning with Cys-Glu-Lys-Asn from near the end of the C1 domain to Ser-Ser-Glu-Lys in the hinge region of PKC Apl I, 30 amino acids after the end of strand 8 from the crystal structure. Expression of fusion proteins was as described (23Pepio A. Sossin W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1256-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For each fusion protein preparation, gels were scanned and analysis performed using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U. S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) to determine the percentage of purified fusion protein at the correct molecular weight and these values (Apl I-C1, 19 ± 3; Apl I-C2, 81 ± 10; Apl II-C1, 26 ± 11; Apl II-C2, 82 ± 20; errors are S.D., n = 3) were used to calculate the stochiometries for fusion protein binding. Much of this degradation occurred during or after elution of the proteins from the glutathione beads as the percentage of purified fusion protein at the correct molecular weight was higher for experiments which used fusion proteins still attached to beads (Apl I-C1, 63 ± 6; Apl I-C2, 90 ± 2; Apl II-C1, 89 ± 10; Apl II-C2, 96 ± 3; errors are S.D.,n = 2). These values were used to standardize the amount of fusion protein in liposome-binding experiments. We purified the kinases after expression in baculovirus as described (13Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purification was done in 1 day leading to less autonomous activity and higher specific activity than previously. Aliquots of kinase were stored in 10% glycerol at −70 °C. Maximal activities of preparations of PKC Apl I ranged from 100 to 400 pmol/min/mg and ranged from 20 to 100 pmol/min/mg for PKC Apl II. The kinases were both approximately 50% pure based on Coomassie staining of the purified proteins (13Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and this value was used to estimate the stochiometry of PDBu binding. Assays for [3H]PDBu binding used the mixed micelle method (24Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Quest A.F. Bardes E.S. Xie W.Q. Willott E. Borchardt R.A. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The 50-μl reaction mixture consisted of 20 μm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 μm CaCl2 or MgCl2, mixed micelles (0–40 mol %) of phospholipids in a final concentration of 0.6% Triton X-100, [3H]PDBu from 1 to 200 nm, fusion protein ranging from 0.02 to 1.6 μg, and purified kinase from 0.25 to 0.35 μg. Mixed micelles were prepared by drying the appropriate volume of each lipid under nitrogen and resuspending in 3% Triton X-100 with vortexing for 1 min followed by incubation at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were started by addition of protein and were allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temperature. Reaction tubes were then placed on ice and bound PDBu was separated from free PDBu on Sephacryl S-100 HR gel filtration columns (2-ml column volume) at 4 °C by washing with equilibration buffer (20 μm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.015% Triton X-100, and 200 μm CaCl2 or MgCl2). The nonspecific binding component for all experiments was measured in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled PDBu and was subtracted from the total binding to yield the specific binding. No differences were seen in experiments using 200 μm CaCl2 or MgCl2. Phospholipids were prepared as described (22Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liposome mixtures consisted of either 1.75 mg of PC or 1.4 mg of PC and 0.35 mg of PA, PS, PI, or PE. Phospholipids were mixed in a 15-ml tube and dried under a stream of nitrogen. All experiments measuring phospholipid binding used liposome mixtures containing 5 μCi of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-l-3-phosphatidyl-[N-methyl-3H]choline (specific activity 108 mCi/mg) as a tracer. Dried phospholipid mixtures were resuspended in 5 ml of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 m NaCl) by vortexing for 3 min. The phospholipid suspensions were then sonicated for 30 s using a probe sonicator (Vibracell) and centrifuged before use to pellet aggregates. The liposome suspensions were stored at 4 °C and used within 1 month. Recombinant proteins (5 or 30 μg of protein) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (standardized to 15 μl wet volume) were prewashed with binding buffer and then added to a reaction mixture containing either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl and3H-labeled liposomes (approximately 200,000 cpm) in a total assay volume of 400 μl. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min with vigorous shaking and then briefly centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge. The bound beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of the binding buffer and liposome binding was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of the beads. We confirmed that equal amounts of fusion proteins were used in the assay by visual inspection of Coomassie-stained gels. The kinase assay using mixed micelles and an Apl II-derived pseudosubstrate peptide was as described (13Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 50-μl proteolysis reaction contained 10 μl of either purified PKC Apl II-GST-C2 domain fusion protein derived from PKC Apl II, or GST alone. The protein component was then incubated with 5 μl of 1% Triton X-100 micelles and 25 μl of 2 × proteolysis buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm MgCl2, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 3 min at 30 °C. The digestion was initiated by addition of 10 μl of trypsin diluted in proteolysis buffer and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 5 min. The final reaction contained either 50 or 200 ng of protein, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0, 0.4, 1, 2, 5, or 10 μg/mln-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. Proteolysis was quenched by addition of 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The MBP-Apl II-C2 fusion protein was injected intramuscularly into rabbits along with TitreMax (Cedar Lane) three times at 3–4-week intervals. Serum from the animals was passed over an affinity column consisting of the GST-Apl II-C2 fusion protein (13Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coupled to Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad) and specifically retained antibodies were eluted and concentrated in a Centriplus-10 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). Western blots were performed as described (18Sossin W.S. Chen C.S. Toker A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with this antibody at a 1:1250 dilution using a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Results were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). The dependence of phorbol ester binding or kinase activity on the mole % of micelles was analyzed by a nonlinear least squares fit to a modified Hill equation (26Newton A.C. Koshland D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using Systat 5.0, where y is the value (PDBu binding or kinase activity), a is the maximum value, × is the mole %,k is the mole % resulting in half-maximal binding, andn is the Hill coefficient, y =a(xn/(kn +xn)). PKC Apl II requires more PS for activation than does PKC Apl I (13; Table I). To examine the ability of other lipids to activate the two enzymes, we determined the lipid specificity of enzyme activation of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II in the presence of 1 mol % DOG using the mixed micelle kinase assay (27Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7184-7190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PS was the most effective lipid for both kinases (Fig. 1 A). PI activated PKC Apl I better than PKC Apl II, although the concentration of PI required was significantly higher than that of PS (Fig. 1 B). PA only stimulated kinase activity of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II at high concentrations (Fig. 1, B and C). Neither PE nor PC could stimulate kinase activity.Table ILipid dependence of PKC activationEnzymeDOGLipidLipid for half-maximal activationHill numbernmol %mol % ± SDn ± SDApl I1PS11 ± 25 ± 1610PS5 ± 0.33 ± 0.4410PS1 ± 0.21 ± 0.52(5 mol % PA)Apl II1PS19 ± 57 ± 3610PS14 ± 26 ± 2410PS9.2 ± 15 ± 13(0.5 mole % PA)10PS8.5 ± 13 ± 12(5 mol % PA)Apl IIΔC21PS15 ± 28 ± 2510PS8.5 ± 0.85 ± 1410PS6.5 ± 0.64 ± 13(0.5 mol % PA)10PS4.1 ± 0.33 ± 12(5 mol % PA)Values for the Hill coefficient and for half-maximal binding were calculated by nonlinear regression (see “Materials and Methods”) for each individual experiment, and the means ± S.D. are presented. n refers to the number of independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Values for the Hill coefficient and for half-maximal binding were calculated by nonlinear regression (see “Materials and Methods”) for each individual experiment, and the means ± S.D. are presented. n refers to the number of independent experiments. One possible explanation for the difference between PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II in the amount of PS required for activity could be that PKC Apl I has a higher affinity for DOG than PKC Apl II, since the concentration of DOG affects the amount of PS required for maximal activity (Table I). However, in the presence of saturating amounts of DOG, or using PDBu (150 nm) instead of DOG, the difference in lipid required by the two enzymes is not diminished (Fig. 1 D and data not shown). Although the results above suggested that for both PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II only PS could effectively synergize with DOG to stimulate enzyme activity, it is possible that in the presence of some PS, other lipids would become more effective. We used levels of PS (5 mol % for PKC Apl I and 10 mol % for PKC Apl II) that gave 10–20% of the maximal activity with 1 mol % DOG and compared addition of more PS to addition of other lipids (Fig. 1, E and F). For PKC Apl I, addition of PA was more effective than addition of PS, despite the poor ability of PA to activate PKC Apl I on its own. PI could replace PS at an equimolar level, while PC and PE were ineffective (Fig. 1 E). For PKC Apl II, PA was equivalent to PS, PI was poorer than PS, and PC and PE had no ability to replace PS (Fig. 1 F). These experiments demonstrate several similarities between the isoforms. For both enzymes, PS was the most effective lipid at increasing PKC activity, while PC and PE had no effects on either enzyme. These experiments also revealed several differences between the enzymes: 1) PI was more effective at stimulating PKC Apl I kinase activity than PKC Apl II; 2) PA was more effective at stimulating kinase activity in the presence of small amounts of PS in PKC Apl I than PKC Apl II; and 3) PKC Apl I required less lipid for activation than PKC Apl II. To determine the lipid specificity for PKC binding, we compared the ability of lipids to induce PDBu binding to PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II using the mixed micelle PDBu binding assay (24Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), since this assay allows us to use the same lipid compositions used to measure kinase activity. In this assay bound [3H]PDBu is separated from free [3H]PDBu by gel filtration since micelles bound to protein and PDBu are larger than micelles bound to PDBu alone. This assay will only detect protein bound to PDBu that is also bound to micelles and thus PDBu binding in this assay is directly related to the ability of lipids to support enzyme binding to the mixed micelles (25Quest A.F. Bardes E.S. Xie W.Q. Willott E. Borchardt R.A. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Newton A.C. Koshland D.J. J. Biol.

We found that the lipid specificity for PDBu binding differed from that for kinase activation. In contrast to the superiority of PS in stimulating kinase activity, PS and PA were equally effective at inducing PDBu binding (Fig. 2 A). PI supported PDBu binding to a greater extent for PKC Apl II than PKC Apl I, while the reverse was true for enzyme activity. Neither PC nor PE could support PDBu binding. There was no difference in the K½ for PS to stimulate PDBu binding between the two isoforms, as opposed to the large difference in the K½ for PS measured for enzyme activity (Fig. 2 B; Tables I andII). Thus, the difference in the amount of PS needed to stimulate enzyme activity of PKCs Apl I and Apl II was not reflected in the ability of PS to stimulate PDBu binding to the two enzymes.Table IILipid dependence of PDBu bindingProteinPDBuLipidLipid for half-maximal PDBu bindingHill numberMaximal PDBu bindingnnmmol % ± S.D.n ± S.D.mol/mol ± S.D.Apl I150PS16 ± 17.4 ± 1.10.38 ± .093Apl II150PS16 ± 0.34.1 ± 0.20.19 ± .063Apl I GST-C1150PS15 ± 24.9 ± 0.90.26 ± .143Apl II GST-C1150PS16 ± 13.0 ± 0.80.10 ± .063Values for the Hill coefficient and for half-maximal binding were calculated by nonlinear regression (see “Materials and Methods”) for each individual experiment, and the means ± S.D. are presented. n refers to the number of independent experiments.

In order to determine whether the lipid specificity of the enzymes could be explained by the lipid specificity of the isolated regulatory domains, we measured PDBu binding to fusion proteins containing the C1 or C2 domains of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II. Proteins of the correct molecular weight were observed for all constructs (Fig. 3), along with several degradation products the size of GST. Since GST does not bind to PDBu (data not shown), these proteins should not interfere with the PDBu binding assays. The lipid specificity for PDBu binding to the C1 domains was very similar to that of the purified enzymes (Fig. 4 A). The only exception was that PDBu binding to the C1 domains of PKC Apl II was induced more strongly by PA than PS compared with the full-length enzyme. The GST-C2 domain fusion proteins did not bind to PDBu (data not shown). Similar amounts of PS were required for PDBu binding to the C1 domains of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II (Fig. 4 B) as to the full-length enzymes (Fig. 2 B and Table II). These results suggest that the lipid specificity for PDBu binding to the kinases can be largely explained by the lipid specificity of the C1 domains, and that PS interacts with the C1 domains of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II in a similar manner. Since the C2 domains do not bind to PDBu, we determined their lipid specificity by measuring the ability of liposomes to bind to fusion proteins that were still attached to glutathione beads. This is a well characterized assay that has been used previously to measure Ca2+-dependent lipid binding to the synaptotagmin C2 domain and the C2 domain of PKCβ (22Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The liposomes are made up of 80% PC and 20% of each of the other lipids. The C2 domain of PKC Apl I bound liposomes containing PS or PA, but not other lipids, while the C2 domain of PKC Apl II bound no liposomes better than the GST control (Fig. 5 A). The ability of the PKC Apl I C2 domain to bind to liposomes did not require Ca2+, but could be increased by Ca2+ ions (Fig. 5 A). However, the concentration of Ca2+ ions required to stimulate additional liposome binding to the C2 domain was extremely high (1–2 mm Ca2+) (Fig. 5 B). Nevertheless, liposome binding to the GST control was not affected by this concentration of Ca2+ (Fig. 5 B). We also compared the ability of the C1 domains to bind liposomes using this assay. Both GST-C1 domain fusion proteins had higher background binding to PC liposomes than did the GST-C2 domain fusion proteins (Fig. 5 C). However, the ability of the C1 domains to bind the different liposomes broadly agreed with the specificity of lipids to stimulate PDBu binding to the C1 domains. Liposomes containing PI and PA bound better to the PKC Apl II C1 domains than to the PKC A"
https://openalex.org/W2035830103,"Syd is an Escherichia coli cytosolic protein that interacts with SecY. Overproduction of this protein causes a number of protein translocation-related phenotypes, including the strong toxicity against the secY24 mutant cells. Previously, this mutation was shown to impair the interaction between SecY and SecE, the two fundamental subunits of the membrane-embedded part of protein translocase. We have now studied in vitrothe mechanisms of the Syd-directed inhibition of protein translocation. Pro-OmpA translocation into inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs) prepared from the secY24 mutant cells as well as the accompanied translocation ATPase activity of SecA were rapidly inhibited by purified Syd protein. In the course of protein translocation, high affinity binding of preprotein-bearing SecA to the translocase on the IMV is followed by ATP-driven insertion of the 30-kDa SecA segment into the membrane. Our experiments using 125I-labeled SecA and the secY24 mutant IMV showed that Syd abolished both the high affinity SecA binding and the SecA insertion. Syd was even able to release the inserted form of SecA that had been stabilized by a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. Syd affected markedly the proteolytic digestion pattern of the IMV-integrated SecY24 protein, suggesting that Syd exerts its inhibitory effect by interacting directly with the SecY24 protein. In accordance with this notion, a SecY24 variant with a second site mutation (secY249) resisted the Syd action bothin vivo and in vitro. Thus, Syd acts against the SecY24 form of translocase, in which SecY-SecE interaction has been compromised, to exclude the SecA motor protein from the SecYE channel complex.

Thus, Syd acts against the SecY24 form of translocase, in which SecY-SecE interaction has been compromised, to exclude the SecA motor protein from the SecYE channel complex. Protein translocation across the E. coli plasma membrane is facilitated by multiple Sec factors (for reviews, see Refs. 1Wickner W. Leonard M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29514-29516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar and 2Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A membrane-interacting ATPase, SecA, binds with high affinity to the membrane containing the functional SecY/SecE components (3Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). This is then followed by the ATP-dependent insertion of a SecA segment into the membrane (4Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis-dependent release of the preprotein and deinsertion of SecA allow the next cycle of polypeptide movement (4Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). SecY, SecE, and SecG are the essential core components in the membrane, having 10, 3, and 2 transmembrane segments, respectively. They not only provide the high affinity binding site for SecA (3Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) but allow productive SecA insertion (4Economou A. Wickner W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and they are thought to provide a channel-like pathway for the movement of polypeptide chain. These membrane proteins form a trimeric complex (6Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Wickner W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which SecY interacts independently with SecE and SecG (9Homma T. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes reconstituted only from SecY and SecE exhibit some basic translocation activities in conjunction with SecA (10Akimaru J. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6545-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition, the inclusion of SecG markedly stimulates the translocation activities of the SecYE proteoliposomes (8Brundage L. Fimmel C.J. Mizushima S. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nishiyama K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3409-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In vivo, SecY requires SecE as the stabilizing partner (12Matsuyama S. Akimaru J. Mizushima S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,13Taura T. Baba T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7771-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, uncomplexed forms of SecY are degraded rapidly by the FtsH proteolytic system (14Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We proposed previously that a dominant negative variant of SecY, SecY−d1, with a small internal deletion, sequesters SecE in an inactive complex (15Shimoike T. Akiyama Y. Baba T. Taura T. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Intragenic suppressor mutations that abolish the dominant effect preferentially occur within or around cytoplasmic domain 4 (C4) of SecY (16Baba T. Taura T. Shimoike T. Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4539-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ThesecY24 amino acid substitution (Gly240 → Asp) in C4 (17Shiba K. Ito K. Yura T. Cerretti D.P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which also suppressessecY−d 1 intragenically, abolishes the SecY-SecE affinity co-isolation (9Homma T. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Baba T. Taura T. Shimoike T. Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4539-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, C4 is an essential cytoplasmic domain that is important for the interaction between SecY and SecE. The importance of the second cytoplasmic segment (C2) of SecE for SecY-SecE interaction was also shown (18Pohlschröder M. Murphy C. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19908-19914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The secY−d 1 mutation allowed us to identify a new gene, syd, as a multicopy suppressor against this mutation (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The syd gene product (Syd) is a hydrophilic protein of 181 amino acid residues, which is associated weakly with the membrane, presumably via its interaction with the SecY protein. When Syd is overproduced in SecY−d1-expressing cells, it preferentially stabilizes the chromosomally encoded wild-type SecY protein, which is now given a greater opportunity to associate with SecE. This is the proposed suppression mechanism. Another striking phenotype associated with overproduction of Syd is its strong toxicity against the secY24 mutant cells. Presumably because of the defect in SecY-SecE interaction, the SecY24 mutant protein is degraded at 42 °C. This degradation is primarily responsible for the protein export defect (14Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, the Syd-mediated impairment of protein export and cell viability is not accompanied by degradation of the SecY protein (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, Syd seems to directly interfere with the functioning of the SecY24 mutant protein. These observations indicate that Syd provides a useful means to investigate into the nature of protein interactions involving SecY. Through our reversion studies of the secY24 mutant with respect to its susceptibility to Syd overproduction, we identified three new alleles of secY (20Matsuo E. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). While two of them affected residue 240 (the residue altered by secY24) of SecY, the third mutation, termed secY249 (for Ala249 → Val) alleviated the Syd sensitivity of the secY24 alteration (when placed in cis configuration with secY24) without restoring the temperature resistance or the SecY-SecE interaction. Thus, the secY249 mutation may affect the interaction between SecY and Syd. This work was focused on the ability of Syd to inhibit protein translocase when its SecY subunit is altered to the SecY24 mutant form. Our in vitro experiments show that Syd interferes with productive interaction between SecA and the membrane-integrated SecYE complex. Plasmid pST67 contained the syd gene placed under the lacpromoter and a translation-initiating SD sequence (5′-AAGGAG-3′) and was used as a Syd-overproducing plasmid. For its construction, a polymerase chain reaction was programmed on pST30 (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with primers 5′-GGGGTACCCCAAGGAGAACAGCTATGGACGATTTGACCGC-3′ and 5′-GCCCTAGGGCAATGTCTTCTCCGAATT-3′ to produce a 0.57-kilobase pair fragment, which was then treated with KpnI andBamHI and cloned into pUC18. The resulting plasmid was confirmed for the Syd-coding region by sequencing. E. colistrain AD202 was a derivative of MC4100 (21Casadaban M.J. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1984; 3: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was used as a selective marker, and transductants were examined for temperature-sensitivity and Syd sensitivity (20Matsuo E. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); an isogenicsecY+ strain was named EM154. Their further derivatives that received syd::cat from EM166 were named EM168 (secY24 syd::cat), EM167 (secY24–249 syd::cat), and EM169 (secY+ syd::cat).

Syd-overproducing cells (EM147/pST67 or CU141 (23Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. J. Biol.

Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to induce the lac promoter-directed overexpression ofsyd. Syd was purified essentially as described previously (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A.

Protein concentration was determined by a Micro BCA protein assay kit (purchased from Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. IMVs were prepared as described previously (24Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) from cells of the specified strains that had been grown at 30 °C. They were treated with 6 m urea for 1 h at 0 °C (25Taura T. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. Biochimie. 1997; 79: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) when specified. Pro-OmpA was synthesizedin vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine as described previously (26Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription-translation mixture was then mixed with chloramphenicol (100 μg/ml), sodium succinate (5 mm), IMV (100 μg of protein/ml), and SecA (40 μg/ml). Various concentrations of Syd were added before SecA when specified. After incubation at 37 °C, samples were placed on ice and treated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) at 0 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography as described previously (26Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the bands were quantified by a Fuji BAS2000 phosphor imager. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained urea-washed IMV (100 μg/ml), SecA (40 μg/ml) and ATP (4 mm) in buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 30 mm KCl, 30 mm NH4Cl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free, from Nacalai Tesque). It was further supplemented with pro-3His-OmpA′ (66 μg/ml; Ref. 24Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and/or Syd (100 μg/ml) as specified. After incubation at 37 °C, inorganic phosphate liberated was quantified (5Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Lill R. Dowhan W.

To obtain translocation ATPase activities, values in the absence of pro-3His-OmpA′ were subtracted from those in its presence. SecA was iodinated with125I and subjected to the insertion assay essentially as described previously (4Economou A. Wickner W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), except that Syd was added when indicated. SecA binding assays were similarly performed according to previously published procedures (3Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W.

Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The precipitates were washed with acetone, solubilized in SDS sample buffer at 37 °C for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SecY and SecE were then visualized by immunoblotting (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using antiserum against the N-terminal 22 residues of SecY (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and antiserum against residues 64–81 of SecE, respectively. The latter antiserum, a custom product of Sawady Technology, was raised in a rabbit using the synthetic peptide conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Kaleidoscope prestained standards (purchased from Bio-Rad) were used as molecular weight markers in electrophoresis. Overproduction of Syd in the secY24 mutant cells leads to the severest extent of inhibition of protein export known for E. coli sec mutants (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and appeared to merit investigations in vitro. We prepared IMVs from wild-type and secY24 mutant cells grown at 30 °C, the permissive temperature for the mutant. An in vitro translation product of pro-OmpA, labeled with [35S]methionine, was subjected to posttranslational translocation into IMV. When IMVs from secY24 mutant cells were preincubated at 0 °C with increasing concentrations of Syd, translocation of pro-OmpA was progressively inhibited (Fig. 1). In contrast, pro-OmpA translocation into the wild-type IMV was not appreciably affected by Syd of up to 100 μg/ml (Fig. 1). Dose-dependent inhibition of translocation was also observed when a crude cytosol fraction from the Syd-overproducing cells was added to the reaction with the SecY24 IMV. Immunoblotting experiments showed that the concentrations of Syd protein required for a particular level of inhibition were similar between the purified sample and the crude cytosolic fraction, indicating that Syd had not been inactivated during the purification procedures (data not shown). Neither bovine serum albumin, up to 1 mg/ml, nor heat-treated Syd exerted any appreciable inhibitory effect (data not shown). Thus, this inhibition was due to the functional Syd protein and not to some nonspecific factors such as increased protein concentration. When the SecY24 IMV was first incubated with excess Syd, sedimented, and subjected to the translocation assay, substantial levels of translocation of pro-OmpA were observed. Syd concentration in the second incubation mixture was about 15% of that before centrifugation. We suggest that Syd inhibits translocation while in an equilibrium of association and dissociation with IMV. In fact, preincubation was not necessary, since Syd added after the initiation of translocation reaction also prevented the subsequent increase of the translocated molecules (data not shown). None of the translocase subunits was proteolyzed during the pretreatment with Syd or after the incubation at 37 °C with Syd, as confirmed by direct immunoblotting experiments (data not shown). The ATP hydrolysis activity of SecA that is stimulated by a precursor protein and membrane vesicles with intact SecYEG complex is termed translocation ATPase (29Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We found that Syd was a potent inhibitor of translocation ATPase when SecA was combined with the SecY24 IMV. Whereas Syd (100 μg/ml) inhibited this activity almost completely (Fig. 2,solid triangles), the same concentration of Syd only negligibly affected the activity in combination with the wild-type IMV (Fig. 2, solid circles). The inhibitory effect of Syd was specific for ATP hydrolysis that was coupled with translocation, such that neither the membrane ATPase activity (in the absence of preprotein) nor the intrinsic ATPase activity (without any other macromolecules) was affected significantly (data not shown). The addition of Syd into the reaction mixture in which SecA translocation ATPase was already activated by pro-OmpA and SecY24 IMV resulted in almost instantaneous inhibition of the ongoing reaction (Fig. 3).Figure 3Effects of Syd on ongoing reactions of SecA translocation ATPase. Two reactions of SecA translocation ATPase using IMVs from the secY24 mutant (EM168) were initiated at 37 °C. After 5 min, Syd (100 μg/ml) was added to one reaction (solid triangles), whereas the other reaction received the same volume of the buffer (open triangles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We examined the SecA insertion reaction (4Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) using125I-labeled SecA and urea-washed wild-type and SecY24 IMVs. In the absence of added Syd, both wild-type IMV and SecY24 IMV supported the pro-OmpA- and ATP-dependent formation of a membrane-protected 30-kDa fragment (Fig. 4, lane 4), although the efficiency was slightly lower for the SecY24 IMV. A nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, supported apparently pro-OmpA-independent insertion of SecA (Fig. 4, lane 6) as reported previously (5Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). When Syd was included in these reactions, the SecY24 IMV did not support any detectable insertion of SecA, irrespective of whether ATP or AMP-PNP was used (Fig. 4, middle panel, lanes 1–3). In contrast, Syd inhibited SecA insertion into the wild-type IMV only slightly (Fig. 4, upper panel, lanes 1–3). These results indicate that Syd uncouples the SecA functions from the SecY24-mediated protein translocation reaction. To define the target reaction of the Syd inhibition, we carried out SecA binding assays. Various concentrations of SecA and IMV were incubated at 0 °C, and the membrane-bound SecA was isolated for the Scatchard analysis of the binding. SecA binding to the SecY24 IMV was found to be abolished almost completely by Syd. Thus, the high affinity phase of the binding was hardly observed in the presence of Syd (Fig. 5 B, solid triangles). High affinity binding of SecA to the wild-type IMV was lowered by Syd to only a small extent (Fig. 5 A, compare open and solid circles). These results suggest that the Syd action to the SecY24 IMV can essentially be ascribed to the elimination of the high affinity SecA binding. We then examined whether Syd interferes with the SecA-SecY interaction passively, for instance by steric hindrance, or if it acts more actively, for instance to change the subunit arrangement of the SecY-SecE complex. For this purpose, we studied the effect of Syd on a state of SecA that had already been inserted and stabilized as such by AMP-PNP. 125I-Labeled SecA was first allowed to insert into wild-type or SecY24 IMV in the presence of AMP-PNP and then subjected to the second incubation with either Syd or buffer alone. The second incubation in the presence of Syd resulted in the disappearance of the 30-kDa fragment inserted into the SecY24 IMV (Fig. 6, lower panel,lane 1), whereas SecA inserted into the wild-type IMV persisted (Fig. 6, upper panel,lane 1). Incubation without Syd did not cause any change in the intensity of the inserted SecA (compare Fig. 4,lane 6, and Fig. 6, lane 2). Thus, Syd is able to dissociate SecA that is otherwise locked in the inserted state by the lack of ATP hydrolysis. We also noted that the AMP-PNP-stabilized SecA was partially released from the SecY24 IMV, but not from the wild-type IMV, when unlabeled excess SecA was added, suggesting that SecA insertion occurs somewhat weakly against the mutant IMV. ThesecY24 alteration in SecY weakens the interaction between SecY and SecE such that the SecY24-SecE complex comes apart after solubilization with a nonionic detergent (9Homma T. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined trypsin digestion patterns of SecY and SecE in the membrane-integrated state. Wild-type and SecY24 IMV were treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin, and SecY and SecE were detected by immunoblotting using antisera against the N-terminal sequence of SecY and the central cytoplasmic region of SecE, respectively. Treatment of the wild-type IMV with low concentrations of trypsin produced an N-terminal fragment of about 21 kDa (Fig. 7, lanes 17 and 18). Its apparent molecular size suggests that the site of this cleavage was within cytoplasmic region 4 (C4). The SecY24 IMV gave different trypsin digestion patterns in two respects. First, the overall trypsin sensitivity as assessed by the disappearance of the intact SecY molecules was significantly higher for the SecY24 IMV than the wild-type IMV (Fig. 7, compare lanes 6–10 with lanes 16–20). Second, the 21-kDa N-terminal fragment produced from the SecY24 IMV (Fig. 6,lane 7) was further shortened to a slightly faster migrating product when trypsin concentrations were increased (Fig. 7, lanes 8 and 9). Although the SecY24 amino acid alteration (Gly240 to Asp) is also in C4 domain of SecY, it is unrelated to any amino acid residues directly relevant to the trypsin-mediated hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Thus, this sequence alteration may have caused a change in local conformation of SecY or in subunit arrangements of the SecYEG complex. We found a striking difference in the trypsin susceptibility of SecE between the wild-type IMV and the SecY24 IMV. SecE in the former IMV resisted trypsin of the highest concentration examined (Fig. 7,lower panel, lanes 16–20), although some decrease in the intensity of SecE, in parallel with that of the intact SecY, was observed at higher trypsin concentrations (Fig. 7, lanes 11–20, compare upper andlower panels). In contrast, SecE in the SecY24 IMV was digested almost completely by trypsin (Fig. 7, lower panel, lanes 9 and 10). SecE was more trypsin-sensitive than SecY24 itself (compareupper and lower panels forlane 5 of Fig. 7). These results lend further support to the notion that subunit arrangements of the SecYEG complex have been altered by the SecY24 amino acid alteration, resulting in significantly impaired SecY-SecE interaction. We then repeated the trypsin digestion experiments in the presence of an excess of Syd protein. While the addition of Syd did not appreciably affect the trypsin digestion profiles of SecY or SecE in the wild-type IMV, it markedly changed the pattern of SecY cleavage in the SecY24 IMV. The 21-kDa N-terminal fragment was now shifted to an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa (Fig. 7, upper panel,lanes 3 and 4). Thus, the original two cleavage sites (presumably in C4) were somehow protected by Syd. Thus, Syd interacts specifically with SecY24. However, it did not exert any protecting effect on SecE (Fig. 7, lower panel,lanes 4 and 5). Previously, we isolated Syd-resistant variants from thesecY24 mutant (20Matsuo E. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The mutations converged into three alleles in addition to the true reversion. Two of the alleles change residue 240 affected by the secY24 mutation, restoring the SecY-SecE interaction (20Matsuo E. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The other allele, secY249 (for an Ala249 to Val change), is an intragenic suppressor mutation that suppresses only the sensitivity to overproduction of Syd, without any effect on the temperature-sensitive protein export defect of the secY24 mutation (20Matsuo E. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). IMVs prepared from thesecY24–249 double mutant supported pro-OmpA translocation with an efficiency similar to that of the SecY24 IMV. However, it was only slightly inhibited by Syd (Fig. 1). The double mutant IMV also supported the translocation ATPase activity of SecA even in the presence of Syd (data not shown). Insertion of the 30-kDa fragment into the double mutant IMV was not inhibited by Syd (Fig. 4,lower panel, lane 1). The SecY24–249 IMV gave tryptic digestion patterns of SecY and SecE that were essentially identical to those of the SecY24 IMV. However, they were unaffected by the presence of excess Syd (data not shown). Thus, the effects of the secY249 mutation on the phenotypes of thesecY24 mutation have been reproduced in vitro. These results suggest that the Syd effect is brought about through specific interaction between SecY and Syd, in which the residue 249 of SecY plays an essential role. Syd, originally identified as a multicopy suppressor of thesecY−d 1 mutation (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), directly interacts with SecY. Overproduction of Syd stabilizes the wild type SecY protein when it alone is overproduced or when it fails to associate with SecE because of the presence of the excess amounts of SecY−d1, the dominant negative SecY variant. The association of Syd with the plasma membrane is saturable such that SecY overproduction increases the membrane-bound state of Syd. We demonstrated in this study that Syd markedly altered the trypsin digestion pattern of SecY24 in IMV, lending further support to the notion that Syd interacts with SecY. Evidence indicates that the secY24 mutation impairs SecY-SecE interaction. The temperature sensitivity of this mutant is partially suppressible by overproduction of SecE, 2E. Matsuo, T. Taura, Y. Akiyama, and K. Ito, unpublished observations. and the mutation can act as an intragenic suppressor against the SecE-sequestering effect of the secY−d 1 mutation (16Baba T. Taura T. Shimoike T. Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4539-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Matsuo E. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). After solubilization of the membrane with a nonionic detergent, a complex between SecY24 and SecE cannot be isolated (9Homma T. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Baba T. Taura T. Shimoike T. Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4539-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The temperature-sensitive protein export defect of the secY24mutant is due to the FtsH-mediated degradation of the SecY24 protein at 42 °C (14Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Baba T. Taura T. Shimoike T. Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4539-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the impaired SecY-SecE interaction is the primary cause of the secY24defect. In further support of this notion, we found that SecE in the SecY24 IMV was more accessible to trypsin digestion than that in the wild-type IMV. The temperature sensitivity of the secY24mutant could be due to temperature-dependent exacerbation of the interaction defect, temperature-dependent activation of the proteolytic system, or both. When Syd is overproduced in the secY24 mutant, protein export is rapidly blocked followed by the loss of viability even at 30 °C (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The severity of this block makes it the most useful system to accumulate chemical amounts of a precursor protein with uncleaved signal sequence within the cell (24Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The rapidity and the lack of accompanied SecY proteolysis suggest that this inhibition is brought about by direct interference by Syd with the translocase functions. We reproduced the inhibitory effect of Syd in the in vitrotranslocation reaction of pro-OmpA. The concentration of Syd required for 50% inhibition of translocation was 5–10 μg/ml (or 250–500 nm) in a reaction containing IMV of 100 μg/ml proteins. Assuming that a cell contains 500 molecules of SecY (31Matsuyama S. Fujita Y. Sagara K. Mizushima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and that 10% of total proteins are located in the inner membrane, the above concentration of IMV corresponds to 250 ng/ml (or 5 nm) of SecY. Thus, numbers of the Syd molecules required for efficient inhibition far exceed those of SecY molecules. We have shown that Syd inhibits the high affinity binding of SecA to the IMV containing the SecY24 form of the translocase subunit. This could be due to a steric hindrance by the SecY-bound Syd with respect to SecA binding. There may be a competition between Syd and SecA for the interaction with SecYEG translocase. Indeed, increased concentrations of SecA acted to partially overcome the inhibition caused by a low concentration (10 μg/ml) of Syd. Although quantitative discussion requires knowledge about the K d value of Syd-IMV binding, our IMV re-isolation experiments suggested that the dissociation rate of Syd is considerably high. Thus, real time binding/dissociation measurements will be required to determine the K d value. While the simple steric hindrance discussed above is possible, we believe it is more likely that Syd causes more drastic structural changes to the SecYE complex. Syd was found to inhibit the SecA insertion reactions. We previously noted that the SecY205 mutant form of SecY (32Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) did not allow the preprotein- and ATP-dependent mode of SecA insertion, while it still allowed SecA insertion in the presence of AMP-PNP (5Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our present results show, in contrast, that Syd abolishes both of these modes of SecA insertion reactions. Thus, it is conceivable that the SecY205 defect lies in a specific process of the SecA insertion reaction cascade, whereas Syd impairs the system more generally or inhibits a very early event. Indeed, Syd inhibited the high affinity binding between SecA and the SecY24 IMV. Furthermore, it acted to dissociate the inserted SecA segment that had been stabilized by AMP-PNP. In these cases, the subunit arrangement of the SecYE complex may have been altered, leading to the elimination of both the high affinity SecA binding site and the structural element (or channel) required for maintaining the “inserted” state of SecA. Previous studies suggested that the high affinity binding of SecA requires both SecY and SecE (3Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 33Hanada M. Nishiyama K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23625-23631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2756-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems to be a logical explanation that the presence of a high concentration of Syd acts to dissociate the SecY-SecE complex that is already compromised by the SecY24 alteration. An interesting possibility here is that Syd may bind preferentially to an uncomplexed state of SecY. This is consistent with the known ability of Syd to stabilize overproduced SecY (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of Syd is elusive (19Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), some speculations may be useful. For instance, Syd may act as a reservoir for unassembled forms of SecY, thus preventing its deleterious effects on the cell (14Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may serve as a regulatory factor that negatively controls the translocase function by interfering with either SecY-SecE or SecY-SecA binding. At any rate, interaction between Syd and SecY seems specific in that it is disrupted by the secY249alteration of residue 249 of SecY. Syd will be useful to probe the architecture of protein translocase from the functional point of view.

https://openalex.org/W2130068784,"Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is one of the major sarcolemmal Ca2+ transporters of cardiac myocytes. In frog ventricular myocytes the exchanger is regulated by isoproterenol via a β-adrenoreceptor/adenylate-cyclase/cAMPdependent signaling pathway providing a molecular mechanism for the relaxant effect of the hormone. Here, we report on the presence of a novel exon of 27-base pair insertion, which generates a nucleotide binding motif (P-loop) in the frog cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. To examine the functional role of this motif, we constructed a full-length frog heart Na+-Ca2+ exchanger cDNA (fNCX1a) containing this exon. The functional expression of fNCX1a in oocytes showed characteristic voltage dependence, divalent (Ni2+, Cd2+) inhibition, and sensitivity to cAMP in a manner similar to that of native exchanger in frog myocytes. In oocytes expressing the dog heart NCX1or the frog mutant (ΔfNCX1a) lacking the 9-amino acid exon, cAMP failed to regulate Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake. We suggest that this motif is responsible for the observed cAMP-dependent functional differences between the frog and the mammalian hearts.

The correct spelling is shown above. Full-Text PDF Open Access The sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is one of the major Ca2+ extrusion pathways of the heart muscle. In nonmammalian species, the exchanger, in addition, may serve as a major Ca2+ influx pathway, as these hearts in general lack well developed intracellular Ca2+ release pools (1Morad M. Orkand R.K.

Two additional genes are expressed in the brain (NCX2 andNCX3) and skeletal muscle (NCX2), but the primary structure of the exchangers remains highly conserved, especially within the 11 putative transmembrane domains. Relatively greater divergence has been found in the N-terminal regions and the large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 5 and 6, where the high affinity Ca2+ regulatory site is located (14Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 90: 3870-3874Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Even though a putative protein kinase A phosphorylation site has been also identified in the mammalian isoform (4Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), no functional evidence for the cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the exchanger has as yet been found. Recently, however, it has been shown that the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in frog but not in mammalian ventricular myocytes is regulated by isoproterenol via the activation of a β-adrenoreceptor/adenylate-cyclase/cAMPdependent pathway (15Fan J. Shuba Y.M. Morad M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5527-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the functional expression of a recombinant cAMP-sensitive frog heart Na+-Ca2+exchanger construct (fNCX1a) with a newly identified 9-amino acid exon which renders the molecule regulatable by cAMP. Procedures to inject and maintain theXenopus oocytes were identical to those described previously (16Shuba Y.M. Naidenov V.G. Morad M. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 432: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For the recording of Na+-Ca2+ exchange current the basic Cl−-free extracellular (glass-funnel) solution contained (in mm): NaOH, 109; Ca(NO3)2, 5; MgSO4, 1; HEPES, 20; niflumic acid, 0.1; flufenamic acid, 0.1; pH 7.3 (adjusted with methanesulfonic acid). Niflumic and flufenamic acids were used as Cl− channel blockers (17White M.H. Aylwin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 720-724PubMed Google Scholar). When necessary the extracellular solution was supplemented with either 1–5 mmNi(NO3)2, 1 mm CdCl2, 500 μm CPT-cAMP, or their combinations. The intracellular Cl−-free solution contained (in mm): NaOH, 20; triethanolamine hydroxide, 100; HEPES, 10; Mg-ATP, 5; EGTA, 5; Ca(NO3)2, 3.2–4.99 (free Ca2+0.1–10 μm); pH 7.3 (adjusted with aspartic acid). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, except for Ni(NO3)2 which was from Aldrich. Oocytes were perfused with intracellular solution through an intracellular glass cannula by applying discrete steps of positive pressure. To measure Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake both control and the frog clone (fNCX1a)-expressing oocytes were injected with (50 ng/oocyte) Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein, aequorin (dissolved in 1 mm EDTA buffer), 3 to 4 h before the measurements. Aequorin-injected oocytes were loaded with Na+ by incubating them for 30 min at room temperature in K+/Ca2+-free Barth's solution containing in mm: NaCl, 88; NaHCO3, 2.4; MgSO4, 0.82; HEPES, 15; pH 7.4 with NaOH, supplemented with 30 μm nystatin (Sigma, prepared as 10 mm stock in Me2SO) and then transferred to K+/Ca2+-free Barth's without nystatin (18Longoni S. Coady M.J. Ikeda T. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C870-C873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Photon emission was measured from Na+-loaded oocytes placed in glass scintillation vials at 6-s intervals in a liquid scintillation counter (model LS250, Beckman). First, the basal photon emission was estimated in a scintillation vial filled with 1 ml of conditioning K+/Ca2+-free Barth's solution. The oocytes were then quickly transferred to a K+/Na+-free Barth's test solution containing in mm: triethanolamine chloride, 90; CaCl2, 0.41; Ca(NO3)2, 0.33; MgSO4, 0.82; HEPES, 15; pH 7.4 with triethanolamine hydroxide, and the measurements were repeated. To measure the Ni2+ sensitivity of the [Na+]i-dependent Ca2+ uptake, photon emission was measured in the K+/Na+-free Barth's solution supplemented with 5 mm NiCl2 prior to the use of test solutions. The screening ofXenopus laevis heart cDNA library using a probe NcoI-MluI (nucleotides 269–2609) fragment of the dog cDNA (gift of K. D. Philipson, Los Angeles, CA) yielded two clones, H3 and H6. Further screening of the library did not produce clones which encode the N terminus. The remaining portion was retrieved from a X. laevis genomic library (Stratagene) using a PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; UTR, untranslated region; CPT-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP. -derived fragment of H3 as a probe (primers: forward, 5′-gtggcagttactattgttcgtcgtgga-3′, reverse, 5′-gctctttctgggtttcgcctggctt-3′). A positive clone X9 was found to contain a nucleotide sequence equivalent to the 1.8-kilobase pair mammalian exon 2. The full-length clone, fNCX1a (3.2 kilobase pairs) was then constructed from X9 and H6 DNAs in pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), using a region encompassing the ATG start codon up to theBbsI (corresponding to amino acid residue F568) of X9, and the remainder from H6, including the entire coding sequence and a 400-base pair 3′-UTR (to the SpeI site). In order to replace the whole 3′-untranslated region of fNCX1a with that of Na+-glucose co-transporter clone, pMJC424 (19Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), the coding region of fNCX1a was amplified by 10 PCR cycles using a sense primer that hybridizes at positions 1–20 of the coding region containing aSalI restriction site before the ATG initiation codon, and an antisense primer that hybridizes to the last 20 nucleotides of the coding region and contains additionally a MluI restriction site downstream to the stop codon. The amplification reaction was carried out in the presence of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and 100 ng of fNCX1a plasmid. The PCR fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with SalI and MluI, and ligated into pMJC424 (19Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) from which the coding region of the Na+-glucose co-transporter had been removed by digestion with SalI and MluI. The resultant plasmid, pF1a/MC, was sequenced. During subcloning of the fNCX1a coding and 3′-UTRs into transcription-competent vector pAGA (20Sanford J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 266: 9570-9579Google Scholar) (a gift of L. Birnbaumer, UCLA, CA) in order to reduce the chances of point mutations due to PCR, only the 5′-terminal part (position −1 to 252) of the coding sequence of fNCX1a was amplified by 10 PCR cycles. Amplification was performed using a sense primer (5′-atcaggtctcccATGGTTGTCCTTCTGCT-3′) that hybridized with the first 17 nucleotides of the coding region and contained a BsaI restriction site (underlined), which after digestion with BsaI gave a NcoI-compatible end, one nucleotide upstream of the initiation ATG codon. Antisense primer that hybridized with the few nucleotides downstream the MfeI site (position 252 of the coding region). The amplification reaction was carried out in the presence of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and 100 ng of fNCX1a plasmid. To provide perfect initiation consensus sequence (27Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar), the C at position −3 of the original fNCX1a was replaced with G. After purification by agarose gel electrophoresis, the PCR fragment was digested with BsaI andMfeI and ligated with MfeI (252 position of the coding region), SpeI (polylinker of pGEM-T plasmid) restriction fragment of fNCX1a into plasmid pAGA (20Sanford J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 266: 9570-9579Google Scholar) between theNcoI and XbaI sites. The resultant plasmid was designated pF1a/AGA. cRNA for the injection into the oocytes was synthesized in vitro from either plasmid pF1a/MC or pF1a/AGA using the mCAPTM mRNA capping kit from Stratagene according to manufacture's instructions. Each oocyte was injected with 50 nl of cRNA solution in water at concentration 0.1 mg/ml. Deletion of the 27-nucleotide fragment (positions 1913–1939) of fNCX1a cDNA clone was made according to Kunkel et al. (21Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). CJ236 cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the pF1a/MC plasmid. 2× YT medium supplemented with 0.25 μg/ml uridine was inoculated with a colony of recombinant clone, and the single-stranded form of the plasmid was isolated using R408 helper phage (Stratagene). A 34-base oligonucleotide complementary to 18 nucleotides upstream and 16 nucleotides downstream of the target sequence was phosphorylated with ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to the single-stranded plasmid. Conversion into closed circular double-stranded form was made with T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase. The double-stranded plasmid was used for transformation of XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). To confirm deletion, plasmid DNAs from several recombinant colonies were sequenced, and the clone containing the desired deletion was selected and designated pF1a/MC(Δ). The X. laevis heart cDNA library was screened with the cDNA pTB11, encoding dog heart Na+-Ca2+ exchanger as a probe. Two overlapping partial cDNA clones, H3 (corresponding to amino acid residues 388–656) and H6 (residue 544-3′-4TR), were isolated and sequenced (GenBankTM accession no. X90838). Unlike H3, the H6 clone contained a 27-base pair insert located at a splicing junction between exons 7 and 8 (22Kraev A. Chumakov I. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and representing a new exon (30Iwata T. Kraev A. Guerini D. Carafoli E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of H6 and H3 showed 87.8% identity to the corresponding part of the dog sequence. However, unlike mammalian clones, the 27-base pair insertion generates an ATP/GTP binding motif (P-loop) by adding the GKS sequence toGKILY (essential amino acids are underlined), thus forming the consensus P-loop structure (A/G)-X 4-G-K-(S/T) (25Saraste M. Sobbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). In the sequence encoded by H3 and H6, the putative protein kinase A phosphorylation site (4Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), and the Ca2+-binding domain (26Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) seen in the mammalianNCX1 proteins are conserved (Fig. 1). To examine the functional role of this motif, we constructed the full-length frog Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Since the frog heart cDNA library lacked coding sequences for the N terminus of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, the X. laevisgenomic library was screened using a fragment (nucleotides 1626–1773) produced by PCR at the N terminus of the H3 clone. The stretch coding for the remainder of the region was found in X9 (GenBankTMaccession no. X90839). A small diversity was found in the region of the overlap between H3/H6 and X9 (534 nucleotides, 178 amino acids). Alignment of the amino acid sequences showed the identity of 92.1%, and the similarity of 94.5% (1-amino acid insertion, 13-amino acid changes, and 17-nucleotide substitutions which do not cause changes in amino acid residues). It should be noted that the portion that was supplemented by the genomic sequence does not contain any known regulatory motifs (4Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed the full-length “composite” frog clone (fNCX1a) for expression studies inXenopus oocytes. Initially we were unable to express fNCX1a inXenopus oocytes. Two strategies were therefore employed to achieve functional expression. First strategy involved the replacement of the whole 3′-UTR of fNCX1a with that of Na+-glucose co-transporter clone pMJC424 (14Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 90: 3870-3874Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which includes a poly(A) tail (19Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) (gift of E. Wright, UCLA, CA). In addition, we replaced G for C in the −3 position to conform to a Kozak consensus sequence (27Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar) and designated it pF1a/MC. In the second strategy, we replaced the 5′-UTR of fNCX1a with that of alfalfa mosaic virus RNA-4 and attached a 90-nucleotide poly(A) tail to the 3′-UTR of fNCX1a. This was done by subcloning the fNCX1a coding and 3′-UTR into the transcription-competent vector pAGA (20Sanford J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 266: 9570-9579Google Scholar) (a gift of L. Birnbaumer, UCLA, CA). This plasmid was designated pF1a/AGA. We have chosen this strategy to verify: (a) if the whole 3′-UTR or only the poly(A) tail were important for translation, and (b) if the efficiency of the translation could be further increased by the presence of the 5′-UTR of alfalfa mosaic virus RNA-4. We found that the pF1a/AGA construct produced a 50% higher level of expression of the exchanger than did pF1a/MC (using INa-Ca in oocytes as a criterion). However, expression of pF1a/AGA was transient, reaching peak values within 24–48 h, and declining rapidly, while pF1a/MC produced a slow but steady level of expression for up to 6–7 days. Thus, the right Kozak consensus initiation site at the 5′-end and the presence of the poly(A) tail at the 3′-UTR are critical for the functional expression of the exchanger. Most of the experiments reported here were carried out using the pF1a/MC construct. The frog exchanger cRNA was synthesized by transcription in vitro of the modified fNCX1a cDNA. Functional expression of the exchanger molecule was assessed 2–4 days later by direct measurements of the expressed current or monitoring of Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake. Electrophysiological experiments were performed in Cl−-free extra- and intracellular solutions, using the “glass-funnel” technique that permits both fast voltage-clamp and intracellular perfusion of devitellinated oocytes (16Shuba Y.M. Naidenov V.G. Morad M. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 432: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake was determined by measuring photon emission of Na+-loaded oocytes injected with the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein, aequorin, after exposure to Na+-free solution. Fig. 2 illustrates the procedures used to isolate the inward and outward components of the membrane current carried by the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in fNCX1a-injected Xenopus oocytes. The standard Cl−-free experimental solutions contained 109 mm Na+ and 5 mm Ca2+ on the outside and 20 mm Na+ and 0.1–10 μm Ca2+ on the inside. Concentrations of free Ca2+ in the intracellular solution were estimated according to the Ca-Buf program (SPECS) (28Fabiato A Methods Enzymol. 1998; 157: 358-417Google Scholar). In Cl−-free internal and external solutions depolarization of the oocyte from a holding potential of −60 to +40 mV activated an outward current which was followed by a tail current on repolarization to −80 mV (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). As the duration of the clamp pulse was prolonged, the outward current decayed slowly, and the tail currents following repolarization to −80 mV were enhanced (Fig. 2 A). Exposure of the myocytes to 3 mmNi2+ blocked a significant portion of both outward and accompanying inward tail currents (Fig. 2 B). Subtraction of currents obtained, in the presence and absence of Ni2+, yielded a slowly decaying outward current followed by an expanding inward tail envelope (Fig. 2 C), representing, respectively, the Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ efflux modes of the exchanger (15Fan J. Shuba Y.M. Morad M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5527-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 1 mm Cd2+ similarly suppressed the current generated by the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in fNCX1a-injected oocytes (data not shown). Fig. 2 F documents the results of a series of experiments showing the differences in Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in the Na+-loaded control and fNCX1a-injected oocytes, and their sensitivity to Ni2+. Photoluminescence in oocytes (Ca2+ uptake) was measured in both conditioning control and K+/Na+-free Barth's test solutions. In control oocytes no differences in photoluminescence were found between the conditioning and test solutions (Fig. 2 F). On the other hand, oocytes injected with fNCX1a showed approximately 15-fold higher photoluminescence in the test compared with conditioning solutions (Fig. 2 F), suggesting significant Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in response to the expression of fNCX1a. Photoluminescence in fNCX1a-injected oocytes was almost completely blocked by addition of 5 mm Ni2+ (Fig. 2 F). To measure voltage-dependence of the exchanger, the oocytes were first depolarized to +40 mV and then the voltage was linearly changed at 200 mV/s to −120 mV (ramp clamp protocol, Fig. 2 D, upper panel). The lower panel of Fig. 2 D shows superimposed traces of control currents, the current in the presence of 3 mm Ni2+, and the difference currents (Ni2+-sensitive I Na-Ca) activated by such a pulse protocol. The Ni2+-sensitiveI Na-Ca had a reversal potential (E Na-Ca) at +20 mV (Fig. 2 E). The average experimental value for E Na-Ca in 14 oocytes from different frogs injected with different samples of fNCX1a was +4.7 ± 2 mV, giving an E Ca of +62.8 mV, and suggesting an effective [Ca2+]i of about 37 μm, (assuming a 3 Na+ for 1 Ca2+stochiometry, [Ca2+]o = 5.0 mm, [Na+]i = 20 mm, [Na+]o = 109 mm). The value of E Ca did not correspond to the buffered concentration of Ca2+ (0.1–10 μm) in the perfusing internal solution. This observation suggests that Ca2+ entering the oocyte via the exchanger during the conditioning depolarization (e.g. Fig. 2,A–D) might accumulate in a confined intracellular space in the vicinity of the membrane. To verify this hypothesis we employed a pulse protocol in which the negative voltage ramp was preceded by progressively longer conditioning depolarization to +40 mV, thus increasing the entry of Ca2+into the oocyte prior to the application of voltage ramp (Fig. 3 A, upper panel). Fig. 3 A (lower panel) shows that prolonging the depolarizing pulse at 40 mV shifted the reversal potential of the exchanger current to more positive values of 3.2, 15, 21.8, 26.8, and 31.8 mV, respectively (Fig. 3 B). At 5 mm[Ca2+]o and with external and internal Na+ of 109 and 20 mm, respectively, the measured reversal potential suggests an effective [Ca2+]i of 35, 55.5, 72.3, 88, and 107 μm, using E Na-Ca = 3E Na − 2E Ca. The experimentally measured shifts of the reversal potential, ΔE Na-Ca = E Na-Ca(1) −E Na-Ca(2), corresponded well with the changes in the effective internal Ca2+ concentration in accordance with the relation, ΔE Na-Ca =E Na-Ca(1) − E Na-Ca(2) = 59log([Ca2+]i(1)/[Ca2+]i(2)), supporting the idea that Ca2+ entering the oocyte via the exchanger accumulates in a confined intracellular space in the proximity of the membrane. Digital integration of the current traces of Fig. 3 Aprovided an estimate of the total amount of Ca2+ entering the oocyte until the exchanger reaches its reversal potential. The total amount of Ca2+ transported and the effective [Ca2+]i, determined from the measurements of the reversal potential, allows estimation of the size of the space equivalent to 27 nl, i.e. ∼2.7% of the average volume of the oocyte (1 μl). In the frog ventricular myocytes the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is suppressed via the β-adrenoreceptor/adenylate-cyclase/cAMP-dependent pathway (15Fan J. Shuba Y.M. Morad M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5527-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since the defolliculated and devitellinated oocytes lack β-adrenoreceptor- and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase (29Smith A.A. Brooker T. Brooker G. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the membrane-permeable cAMP analog CPT-cAMP was used to determine the cAMP sensitivity of fNCX1a-injected oocytes. Fig. 4 A shows that INa-Ca at 40 mV is slowly suppressed by 50–60% (n = 4) on rapid (<500 ms) application of CPT-cAMP. In the presence of CPT-cAMP, 5 mm Ni2+ failed to further inhibit the current, suggesting that virtually all the Ni2+-sensitive INa-Ca had been inhibited by CPT-cAMP. The CPT-cAMP-mediated suppression of the exchanger current was partially reversed by the wash out of extracellular CPT-cAMP, and the extensive perfusion of the oocyte's interior with cAMP-free internal solution (Fig. 4 A). The recovery of the net current was primarily due to the recovery of I Na-Ca, since all of the recovered current was blocked by 5 mmNi2+ (Fig. 4 A). Fig. 4, B and C, shows the CPT-cAMP effect onI Na-Ca recorded in another fNCX1a-injected oocyte, using the envelope-pulse protocol (Fig. 4 B,upper panel). In this oocyte, 6-min exposure to CPT-cAMP resulted in 50% inhibition of the current measured at both the holding potential (−60 mV) and during depolarization to 40 mV. The tail currents accompanying membrane repolarization to −80 mV were virtually abolished in CPT-cAMP-containing solutions, suggesting a strong suppressive effect of cAMP on Ca2+ efflux as well as Ca2+ influx modes of the exchanger (n = 4). Since the presence of the 9-amino acid insertion comprising a putative nucleotide binding domain is the major distinguishing structural feature of the frog cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (fNCX1a), we constructed a deletion mutant, ΔfNCX1a, without the 9-amino acid insertion. Fig. 5 compares the differences in Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake measured by photoemission of aequorin in oocytes injected with the dog heart NCX1, the frog heart fNCX1a, and the mutated frog heart ΔfNCX1a exchangers. Oocytes from each group were separated into two subgroups, one of which following the Na+ loading period was maintained in control conditioning solution and exposed to the control test solution, while the other was maintained in conditioning solution and subjected to the test solutions supplemented with 500 μm CPT-cAMP. The histograms of Fig. 5 show no significant differences in Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake between the control and CPT-cAMP exposed oocytes expressing either the dog heart NCX1 or the mutated frog heart ΔfNCX1a exchangers, both of which lack the 9-amino acid nucleotide binding domain. In sharp contrast, the Na+-dependent Ca2+uptake was significantly smaller in the presence of CPT-cAMP in the oocytes expressing the frog heart fNCX1a isoform, consistent with the idea that the 9-amino acid domain, is critical for cAMP-mediated regulation of the exchanger. We have successfully expressed a functional cAMP-regulated frog Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (fNCX1a) inXenopus oocytes. The most distinguishing structural feature of the construct is the presence of a consensus ATP/GTP binding 9-amino acid motif (P-loop), located between residues 636 and 646 of the main cytoplasmic linker. Deletion of this motif from the clone (ΔfNCX1a) abolished the cAMP-dependent regulation of the exchanger (Fig. 5). fNCX1a, constructed from H3/H6 and a genomic clone X9, contained a small (7.9%) divergence in the overlapping 178-amino acid sequence and only 6.4% divergence at the nucleotide level at the same region. This divergence is in the order of interspecies polymorphism for orthologous genes, since it is substantially lower than that observed between the genes of the same family in mammals (e.g. 35–40% divergence in rat) (23Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether this divergence arises from polymorphic variation of the frog subspecies (where the structure of genus Xenopus is not well defined) or from the unlikely presence of a novel member of NCXfamily is not as yet clear. Irrespective of whether the clone represents a chimera of orthologous genes from related species, the presence of the putative protein kinase A phosphorylation site and Ca2+ binding domain, the similarity in cAMP-mediated regulation between the expressed protein and the exchanger in native frog myocytes (15Fan J. Shuba Y.M. Morad M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5527-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), as well as the abundance of fNCX1a sequence in mRNA of frog heart compared with other tissues, 2A. Kraev and E. Carafoli, unpublished data. suggests that the clone represents a legitimate molecular model to study the functional implication of the novel motif. Voltage clamp studies in early 1970s have shown that developed tension in frog heart has a dominant tonic and a small phasic component (1Morad M. Orkand R.K. J. Physiol. 1971; 219: 167-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2Morad M. Goldman Y. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1973; 27: 257-313Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar,31Vassort G. Rougier O. Pflungers Arch. 1972; 331: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the presence of catecholamines, however, the phasic (I Ca-dependent) component of tension is strongly enhanced, while the sigmoid Na+-dependent tonic component is strongly suppressed (32Morad M. Sanders C. Weiss J. J. Physiol. 1981; 311: 168-178Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This dual effect of catecholamines was thought to result from both increased Ca2+ influx via the Ca2+ channels and enhanced uptake of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In light of recent studies showing the virtual absence of SERCA II gene of Ca-ATPase and phospholamban proteins in the frog heart (33Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Folia Pharmacol. Jpn. 1993; 102: 46PGoogle Scholar, 34Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol.,. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 35Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the exchanger may be the molecular site that mediates the relaxant effects of catecholamines. At first the suppressive effect of cAMP on the exchanger appears contraintuitive, but considering that the Ca2+ channel and the plateau of the action potential are significantly enhanced in the presence of catecholamines (32Morad M. Sanders C. Weiss J. J. Physiol. 1981; 311: 168-178Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36Fischmeister R. Hartzell H.C. J. Physiol. 1986; 376: 183-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), necessarily increasing Ca2+ influx via the exchanger, the cAMP-dependent suppression of the exchanger may be the appropriate evolutionary solution to stem the tide of large Ca2+ influx that would result. Thus, the suppression of the tonic Ca2+ influx pathway may contribute to the early fall in tension observed during depolarizing pulses in the presence of isoproternol (32Morad M. Sanders C. Weiss J. J. Physiol. 1981; 311: 168-178Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The β-agonist/protein kinase A-induced temporal shift of the fraction of contractile Ca2+, transported into the cell during the action potential from the exchanger to the Ca2+ channel, may be related to the evolutionary requirement of the fight and flight reflex in almost all nonmammalian vertebrates (and possibly prenatal mammals) lacking significant SERCA II and intracellular Ca2+ release pools. Thus, the heart of these animals may utilize the same β-adrenergic regulatory mechanism for both the control of phasic (Ca2+ channel) and tonic (exchanger) transport of Ca2+ and development of tension. Under sedentary conditions the exchanger would primarily deliver and extrude the contractile Ca2+ into and out of the cell. Upon sympathetic stimulation, as the heart shifts to the faster Ca2+ delivery pathway via the phosphorylated Ca2+ channel, the influx of Ca2+ via the exchanger would be suppressed, providing the heart with faster but shorter contractions to accommodate the faster heart rate. Whether such a protein kinase A-dependent-regulatory mechanism can be made to operate by genetic manipulation of the mammalian Na+-Ca2+ exchanger when the exchanger is overexpressed (37Hatem S.N. Sham J.S.K. Morad M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Flesch M. Schwinger R.H.G. Schiffer F. Frank K. Sudkamp M. Kuhn-Regnier F. Arnold G. Bohm M.

https://openalex.org/W2010650735,"Several variants of Escherichia coliadenylate kinase, designed to bind a Zn2+ ion, were produced by site-directed mutagenesis. The metal binding and enzymatic properties of the engineered variants have been described (Perrier, V., Burlacu-Miron, S., Bourgeois, S., Surewicz, W. K., and Gilles, A.-M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 19097–19101). Here we report the structural properties and stability changes in a 4-Cys variant which binds a Zn2+ ion and has an increased thermal stability. CD studies indicate a very similar secondary structure content in the wild type and the engineered variant. NMR analysis revealed that the topology of the parallel β-sheet, belonging to the protein core, and of the peripheral antiparallel β-sheet are also conserved. The small local changes observed in the neighborhood of the substitution sites reflect a more compact state of the metal-binding domain. The Zn2+-bound quadruple mutant shows an increased thermal stability, reflected in a 9 °C increase of the mid-temperature of the first cooperative unfolding step. Binding of a bisubstrate analogP1,P5-di(adenosine-5′)-pentaphosphate increases, by about 7 °C, the midpoint of this transition in both wild type and modified variant. The NMR data suggest that the peripheral domains involved in substrate binding unfold during the first denaturation step. Urea denaturation experiments indicate an increased resistance against chemical unfolding of the Zn2+-binding variant. In contrast, the Gibbs free energy of unfolding (at physiologically relevant conditions) of the quadruple mutant is lower than that of the wild type.

Adenylate kinases (AKs) 1The abbreviations used are: AK, adenylate kinase; Ap5A,P1,P5-di(adenosine-5′)-pentaphosphate; AKe, wild-type E. coli adenylate kinase; AKC4, adenylate kinase variant with four amino acid substitutions (H126C, S129C, D146C, and T149C); AKHC3, three-substitution variant (S129C, D146C, and T149C); LID, domain closing over ATP of AKe (residues 122–159); DQF-COSY, double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement two-dimensional spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy. represent a class of small (20–26 kDa) and abundant phosphotransferases involved in the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate group from ATP to AMP. They contribute to the maintenance of a constant level of cellular adenine nucleotides, necessary for energetic metabolism and nucleic acid synthesis. From the structural point of view (Fig. 1) AKs belong to the α/β class (a five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by several α-helices), characteristic for many nucleotide-binding proteins (1Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 61-67Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In addition to this protein core, they contain generally two smaller domains involved in the substrate binding. One is composed by two helices (α2 + α3) and contributes to the mononucleotide binding, NMP domain closing over bound AMP (residues 30–59). The other is involved in binding of ATP and, due to its large movement, closing over the bound nucleotide, it was called LID domain. In the mitochondrial and most of the bacterial variants of AK, the LID domain has 38 residues (residues 122–159 in AKe) while smaller cytosolic enzymes have only an irregular loop of 11 residues (2Schulz G.E. Müller C.W. Diederichs K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Gerstein M. Schulz G. Chotia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the AKe (a “long” kinase) the LID domain contains a small four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (4Müller C.W. Schlauderer G.J. Reinstein J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1996; 4: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). X-ray structures of the enzyme in complex with various ligands revealed that this domain has significantly different positions relative to the protein core, depending on the nature and number of bound ligands. Therefore, it was inferred that complexation (particularly with ATP) induces a large scale rotation/translation movement from a remote position into a close contact with the main part of the protein (3Gerstein M. Schulz G. Chotia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 4Müller C.W. Schlauderer G.J. Reinstein J. Schulz G.E.

Glaser M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6100-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), confirmed the existence of such hinge motion of the LID domain upon binding of Ap5A, AMP, and ATP. Nevertheless, the short AKs conserve their catalytic activity despite the absence of the LID domain, but seems to loose the high specificity for ATP (8Miyoshi K. Egi Y. Shioda T. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A screening of bacterial AKs has revealed that the enzymes from Gram-positive organisms bind a Zn2+ ion viacoordinative bonds to four side chains (Cys and Asp) situated in the β-hairpin loops of the LID domain (9Glaser P. Presecan E. Delepierre M. Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Bârzu O. Gilles A.-M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Based on sequence comparison with AK from the Gram-positive, thermophilic Bacillus stearothermophilus, we have designed several variants of theEscherichia coli enzyme involving three- or four-amino acid substitutions in the LID domain, at positions His126, Ser129, Asp146, and Thr149. In the companion study (10Perrier V. Burlacu-Miron S. Bourgeois S. Surewicz W.K. Gilles A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19097-19101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) we showed that some of these variants bind a Zn2+ ion and conserve the enzymatic activity. In this study we report the results of NMR and CD experiments aimed to characterize in more detail the structural consequences of the amino acid substitutions and zinc binding. The 4-Cys variant has an increased thermal and chemical (urea) stability, but the structural stability at physiologically relevant conditions is slightly reduced. All chemicals were of highest purity available. Protein design, expression, and purification were described in our companion study (10Perrier V. Burlacu-Miron S. Bourgeois S. Surewicz W.K. Gilles A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19097-19101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco 700 spectropolarimeter in a 0.1-cm quartz cells. The spectra were obtained as an average of five runs and were corrected for the contribution of the buffer. For the thermal denaturation experiments we followed the ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature, programmed to rise uniformly at 60 °C/h. Urea denaturation was monitored by the changes in ellipticity at 222 nm. Aliquots of concentrated solutions of protein were added to urea solutions (0–8.8 m) and the samples were incubated until equilibrium was reached at the temperature chosen for determining the unfolding curve (20 °C). The Gibbs free energy of denaturation was estimated by Equation 1 ΔG=−RT lnKEquation 1 where K is the equilibrium constant of denaturation at a given reaction temperature (RT) and urea concentration. The measured free energy difference is considered (11Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar) a linear function of the denaturant concentration ΔG=ΔGH2O−m[urea]Equation 2 where ΔG(H2O), the extrapolated value of ΔG at zero molar denaturant, represents the intrinsic stability of the protein in absence of urea. Samples were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm) in 2H2O or in 1H2O containing 7% 2H2O at pH 6.5. NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Unity 500 NMR spectrometer, using standard methods for pure absorption DQF-COSY (12Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), NOESY (13Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar), and TOCSY experiments with 30–60-ms spin lock times (14Davis D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Proton chemical shifts were referenced relative to the water signal which, in our conditions, at 308 K resonates at 4.69 ppm from the sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane sulfonate signal. CD spectroscopy in the far-UV region is a sensitive measure of the secondary structure content in polypeptides and is particularly useful in comparing the backbone structural differences between related proteins (15Johnson Jr., C.W. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The similarity between the CD spectra of the wild-type and mutated enzymes (data not shown) indicates that the two proteins have roughly the same secondary structure content. NMR analysis of a protein such as AKe (23,587 Da, flexible domains, high α-helix content) is a difficult task. The proton resonance assignment was facilitated by the large spectral dispersion in the fingerprint region corresponding to β-strand residues and by the strong sequential connectivities between CαHi and NHi+1 in this type of secondary structure (16Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Using several two-dimensional homonuclear NMR spectra (DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY) we assigned the majority of the resonances corresponding to the two β-sheet domains in the AKe and AKC4. The quality of the two-dimensional spectra and some of the sequential NOE pathways of AKC4 are shown in Fig. 2. The chemical shift values for the assigned resonances in the proton spectra of AKC4 and AKe are available upon request from the authors. Resonance assignment enabled us to identify a large number of sequential and long range dipolar interactions between specific protons of the protein. Observation of strong sequential connectivitiesd αN(i, i + 1) indicates very short distances between the corresponding protons (CαHi, NHi+1), as is the case for a backbone in an extended conformation. The local geometry was further characterized by the analysis of the chemical shift values. Indeed, statistical analysis of experimental NMR data on proteins, showed that the Cα protons experience a mean upfield shift of 0.4 ppm if the residue belongs to an α-helix and almost the same downfield shift value in the β-sheet or extended structures (17Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Together, the sequential connectivities and the secondary shift of α protons provided a reliable delineation of the β-strands in AKe and AKC4. In addition, analysis of long range NOEs between resonances corresponding to the backbone protons revealed the relative arrangement of the secondary structure elements. In particular, the presence of long range d αα(i, j) NOE cross-peaks is characteristic for antiparallel β-sheets. The synthesis of the present NMR data is the global topology of the polypeptide chain in the two β-sheet domains, as represented in Fig. 3 for AKC4. A number of other long range dipolar interactions involving all the protons support this topology. For instance, methyl protons of Leu153 give NOE connectivities with amide protons of Tyr133, Gly144, and Lys145 and with aromatic protons of Tyr133. The secondary and tertiary structure descriptions of AKC4, based on the present experimental data, are very similar to that obtained for the wild-type enzyme and are completely compatible with the crystallographic structure of AKe (4Müller C.W. Schlauderer G.J. Reinstein J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1996; 4: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, a number of minor spectroscopic modifications were observed between the wild-type protein and AKC4 in the LID domain. Chemical shift changes (up to 0.45 ppm) were noted for residues adjacent to the substituted positions (Ala127, Val125, and Val148). Also, dipolar interactions between amide protons of Tyr133 and Thr154 and δ1,2 methyl protons of Leu153 were observed in AKC4 but not in AKe. This suggests that Zn2+ binding in AKC4 brings closer the two loops containing the cysteine side chains, and the movement extends over the adjacent β-strands, so that the methyl groups of Leu153 comes into NOE contact with the amide proton of Tyr133. In contrast, sequentiald NN(i, i + 1) connectivities for the amide pairs 147/148 and 148/149 and the NOE between CαH(145) and NH(153) were observed in AKe but not in AKC4 spectra. The heat-induced denaturation curve in Fig. 4 was obtained by recording the ellipticity at 222 nm, which is the minimum in the far-UV CD spectrum for an α-helix. The two proteins show a similar profile including an initial slow phase followed by two cooperative transitions, separated by a clear plateau. As reflected in the relative ellipticity changes, a comparable amount of secondary structure is unfolded in each step. The Tm (the mid-temperature of the cooperative transition) for the first transition of the wild-type protein is 52.5 °C which is in good agreement with the previous data (18Monnot M. Gilles A.-M.

Gilles A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19097-19101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The quadruple mutant shows a significantly increased mid-temperature (61.6 °C), close to the thermal transition (63 °C) observed by microcalorimetry (10Perrier V. Burlacu-Miron S. Bourgeois S. Surewicz W.K. Gilles A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19097-19101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The apoAKC4 (the four Cys mutant in absence of Zn2+) has an intermediate thermal stability between the wild type and AKC4 (TableI). Dithiothreitol, an efficient sulfhydril reductant, at 1–10 mm has no significant effect on the denaturation transition points.Table IParameters of the thermal and urea unfolding for wild type and engineered adenylate kinasesProteinAKeApoAKC4AKC4A.

Open table in a new tab The second transition, not observed in previous studies, is less cooperative and shows more similar Tm values for the two proteins (72.6 and 75.6 °C for AKeand AKC4, respectively). The unfolding process is entirely reversible for AKC4 and partially reversible (80%) for the wild-type protein when the temperature cycle is stopped after the first transition. When the unfolding cycle is continued over this temperature, the denaturation is irreversible. Ap5A is a bisubstrate analog which binds simultaneously at the ATP and AMP sites of AKs, giving a more compact structure in which the LID domain is in close contact with the protein core (20Müller C.W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To quantify the effect of its binding on the structural stability we studied the denaturation process in the presence of an equimolar concentration of Ap5A. The first transition is significantly shifted toward higher temperatures for AKe, apoAKC4, and AKC4by about 7 °C (Fig. 4 and Table I). In contrast, no effect was observed on the second transition. A similar thermal protection was observed for a fluorescent analog of Ap5A (19Reinstein J. Vetter I.R. Schlichting I. Rösch P. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7440-7450Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The temperature-induced unfolding of the wild type and two mutated variants was further studied by recording one-dimensional proton NMR spectra at different temperatures. The heating up to the first equilibrium intermediate state is accompanied by continuous, small changes of some resonances corresponding to nonexchangeable protons. Some of these peaks were identified in the NMR one-dimensional spectra and were assigned to precise protons of the protein (Fig. 5). One example corresponds to the aromatic protons of Tyr181: a second peak, slightly high field shifted and of increasing intensity is observed in all three samples. Similarly, resonances from imidazole protons of His172 undergo a small upfield shift while the high field peak from Leu213 methyl (chemical shift = −0.16 ppm) is unchanged. At the temperature where the first unfolding transition already took place, these resonances are probes for a folded structure as their chemical shift values are very different (from 0.36 to 0.94 ppm) from the random coil values (16Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). We note that Tyr181, Leu213, and His172 are located in helices, α8, α9, and C-end of α7, respectively, within the protein core (Fig. 1). Their chemical shift values should be largely dominated by the ring current of neighboring aromatic side chains (Tyr182, Tyr105, and Tyr171, respectively). These observations reflect only small local conformational rearrangements of the side chains within a conserved secondary and tertiary structure. Compared with the wild type, the spectral changes in the two variants AKC4 and AKHC3 extend over larger temperature ranges, suggesting that the Zn2+ binding in the LID domain influences the local fluctuations in the central core. A large number of Cα protons, resonating between 4.7 and 6.0 ppm, conserve their low field shift characteristic for β-strand secondary structure. An example is the Cα proton of Tyr193, a residue from the β5 strand of the parallel sheet, which is clearly identified in all one-dimensional spectra at 5.77 ppm (Fig. 5). In the case of AKC4, this observation is indicative of persistence of β secondary structure in the intermediate state of the denaturation process (at 70 °C). For AKe and AKHC3, the native CαH are conserved during the first thermal transition. Coupled with the CD data, the temperature-dependent NMR observations suggest that the parallel β-sheet and part of the surrounding α-helices are conserved in the intermediate state and denaturate only during the second thermal transition. Unfortunately, due to aggregation problems, the NMR study was limited to the first part of the denaturation process. The structural stability was further studied using urea as a chemical agent and CD spectroscopy. A single sigmoidal transition was observed for the two studied proteins (not shown). Curve fitting using a two-state model enabled us to calculate the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the structural stability of the proteins (Table I). The urea concentration at which half of the molecules are denatured (Cm) is significantly higher in AKC4 variant reflecting a better resistance to urea denaturation of this protein. The calculated Gibbs free energy of unfolding, extrapolated to zero urea concentration (ΔG(H2O)) is larger in the wild type relative to the engineered variant. Thus, despite an increased thermal stability and a higher resistance to chemical denaturation, the quadruple mutant has a lower structural stability in standard conditions (no denaturant, 20 °C). The coefficient of linear dependence of the Gibbs free energy of unfolding on the urea concentration (m) is considerably decreased in AKC4, indicating a decreased cooperativity of unfolding in the engineered protein. As indicated by the CD and NMR results, introduction of 4 Cys residues and zinc binding in the engineered variant AKC4 conserve the global fold of the polypeptide chain and induce only small structural changes in the LID domain. The Zn2+-binding loops come closer to each other and the domain becomes more compact. The fact that the catalytic properties are practically conserved suggests that the domain keeps its ability to move toward the ATP-binding site. This is further supported by the fact that Ap5A binding (which is known to favor this movement) increases the thermal unfolding mid-temperature (Tm) with similar extent in both wild type and AKC4 (Fig. 4). The present experimental data provide a minimal structural basis for a basic description of the thermal unfolding process of AKe. The CD experiments indicate a complex thermal denaturation mechanism with two separated cooperative steps. Comparative analysis of the NMR and CD data suggests that the protein core, including the parallel β-sheet and the surrounding helices (α1, α8, and α9), is conserved in the equilibrium intermediate state and unfolds in the second step. This domain represents about 45% of the total regular secondary structure (α-helix and β-sheet) contributing to the CD signal around 220 nm, in reasonable agreement with the relative extent of ellipticity change during the second unfolding transition (Fig. 4). In agreement with this hypothesis, Ap5A shifts significantly theTm of the first transition but has only a minimal effect on the second one. Indeed, structural analysis of the bi-substrate binding (3Gerstein M. Schulz G. Chotia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) revealed that the most perturbed fragments are the connecting helices (α6 and α7) while the parallel β-sheet is not affected. The present experiments provide no definite data on the role of the LID domain in the denaturation process. Recent1H/2H exchange experiments on15N-labeled Ake 2S. Burlacu-Miron and C. T. Craescu, unpublished results. revealed that some amide protons in the antiparallel β-sheet exchange more rapidly than in the protein core (parallel β-sheet, α1, α8, and α9) but more slowly than in the peripheral α-helices. This suggests that the LID domain exhibits a more fluctuating hydrogen bond network than the parallel β-sheet and may unfold in early stages of denaturation. The large values of the temperature factors observed in x-ray studies in the LID domain of the unliganded AKe (4Müller C.W. Schlauderer G.J. Reinstein J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1996; 4: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) support this hypothesis. Interaction of AK with the bi-substrate Ap5A leads to a more symmetric and compact molecule and induces a structural stabilization of the nucleotide-closing domains (the antiparallel β-sheet, helices α2 and α3) and of the connecting helices (α6 and α7). The total accessible surface of the protein decreases by about 13% (4Müller C.W. Schlauderer G.J. Reinstein J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1996; 4: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and the ligand forms tight contacts with several side chains in the active site (20Müller C.W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These factors should contribute to the Ap5A-induced delay of the first denaturation step of the two proteins described here. The experiments done on apoAKC4 indicate that the four side chain substitution and zinc binding have a cumulative effect in increasing the thermal stability. Analysis of the crystal structures suggests that the stability of the LID domain is mainly due to a network of hydrogen bond interactions between several side chains (including the 4 substituted residues, Arg131, Tyr133, and Glu151) keeping closer the two small β-sheets. The 4 Cys residues (by their smaller size and polar character) are able to integrate into this network, increasing the global thermal stability of the protein. Zn2+ binding has an additional contribution in restraining the global flexibility of this solvent-exposed domain. This decreased flexibility is one of the factors shown to differentiate the thermostable proteins from their mesophilic counterparts (21Macedo-Ribeiro S. Darimont B. Sterner R. Huber R. Structure. 1966; 4: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (108) Google Scholar). By an induced effect, the zinc finger domain may also stabilize the helices connecting the domain to the protein core (α6 and α7), preventing the fraying of peripheral structural elements. In contrast, it has no significant effect on the unfolding of the parallel β-sheet which takes place at higher temperatures. The Tm of the AK from the thermophilic B. stearothermophilus (74.5 °C) (9Glaser P. Presecan E. Delepierre M. Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Bârzu O. Gilles A.-M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) is similar to that of the second unfolding transitions reported here for AKe and AKC4. This means that besides the contribution of the zinc binding region there are other contributions to the thermostability, especially related to the external helices. Indeed, when the metal ion is removed from the thermophilic enzyme, Tm decreases to 67 °C, a value which is still considerably higher than in AKe. In contrast with the increased stability against thermal and chemical denaturation of AKC4, its structural stability in standard physicochemical conditions appears to be lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (Table I). The explanation of this observation requires a reliable thermodynamic characterization of the protein unfolding, based on combined variation of several physicochemical factors (temperature, pH, chemical denaturant, and so forth). Also, the complete NMR spectral assignment, the structure determination and characterization of the internal dynamics of the proteins will provide the necessary structural basis. These studies are currently in progress in our laboratory. We thank Joël Mispelter and Petya Christova for useful discussions."

In order to rationally manipulate T cell epitopes, three nonpeptidic spacers have been designed from the x-ray structure of a MHC-peptide complex and substituted for the T cell receptor-binding part of several antigenic peptides. The binding of the modified epitopes to the human leukocyte antigen-B*2705 protein was studied by an in vitrostabilization assay, and the thermal stability of all complexes was examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Depending on their chemical nature and length, the introduced spacers may be classified into two categories. Monofunctional spacers (11-amino undecanoate, (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate trimer) simply link two anchoring peptide positions (P3 and P9) but loosely contact the MHC binding groove and thus decrease more or less the affinity of the altered epitopes to human leukocyte antigen-B*2705. A bifunctional spacer ((R)-3-hydroxybutyrate tetramer) not only bridges the two distant anchoring amino acids but also strongly interacts with the binding cleft and leads to a 5-fold increase in binding to the MHC protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a nonpeptidic modification of T-cell receptor binding residues that significantly enhances the binding of altered peptide ligands to their host MHC protein.

The molecular mechanisms of peptide selection have been characterized by x-ray diffraction studies of several MHC proteins in complex with either a peptide pool or single ligands (2Madden D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 587-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Peptides, generally nonamers, tightly bind to conserved MHC residues in a sequence-independent manner at their N and C termini (3Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), whereas the central part of the bound peptide bulges out of the binding groove (4Guo H.C. Jardetzky T.S. Garrett T.P.J. Lane W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Peptide specificity is governed by the position and chemical nature of some anchoring side chains (often P2, P3, and P9) that bind to MHC polymorphic pockets (5Saper M.A. Bjorkman P.J. Wiley D.C. J.

Complementary to x-ray structure determinations, sequencing self-peptides naturally bound to MHC proteins allows the determination of peptide binding motifs (7Falk K. Rötzschke O. Stevanovic S.

Since some class I MHC alleles are associated with either susceptibility or resistance to human diseases (13Brewerton D.A. Hart F.D. Nicholls A. Sturrock R.D.

Nature. 1993; 363: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). However, natural peptides cannot be easily used as immunosuppressors because of poor enzymatic stability and pharmacokinetic properties (18Ishioka G.Y. Adorini L. Guery J.-C. Gaeta F.C.A. LaFond R. Alexander J. Powell M.F. Sette A. Grey H.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4311-4319Google Scholar). Herewith, we describe the substitution of nonpeptidic moieties for the TcR contact amino acids of several T cell epitopes naturally presented by the class I MHC protein B*2705, which is strongly linked to severe inflammatory diseases like ankylosing spondylitis (13Brewerton D.A.

Today. 1993; 14: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Some reports in which a similar strategy has been followed (20Rognan D. Scapozza L. Folkers G. Daser A. Proc. Natl.

The present study describes a novel oligomeric spacer able not only to link two MHC anchoring positions (P3 and P9) but also to significantly improve binding to the restricting class I MHC protein. Molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations were carried out using the AMBER 4.1package (23Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.C. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C.

Force field parameters for the ester group were taken from the literature (25Fox T. Scanlan T.S. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11571-11577Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Atomic charges for the Aua and HB monomers were calculated using the GAUSSIAN 94 package (26Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Gill P.M.W. Johnson B.G. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Keith T.A.

Comput. Chem. 1995; 16: 1357-1377Crossref Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Atomic charges for both new monomers are listed in TableI.Table I Open table in a new tab Initial coordinates for the MHC-ligand complexes were obtained from the x-ray structure of HLA-B*2705 (3Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Rognan D. Scapozza L. Folkers G. Daser A. Proc.

Des. 1997; 11: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The spacers were substituted for the natural pentapeptide sequence using the SYBYL modeling package (TRIPOS Association, Inc., St. Louis, MO). From a starting fully extended conformation, dihedral angles of the main chain between P3 and P9 were modified by hand in order to reproduce a correct trans geometry for the newly introduced amide or ester bonds. The ligand was first relaxed by 500 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization while maintaining the protein fixed. It was then submitted to a 100-ps simulated annealing protocol in order to sample the broadest conformational space accessible. Starting with random velocities assigned at a temperature of 1000 K, the ligand was first coupled for 50 ps to a heat bath at 1000 K using a relatively weak temperature coupling constant τ (0.2 ps) and then linearly cooled down to 50 K for the next 50 ps while τ was strengthened to a value of 0.05 ps. During these 100 ps, no protein atoms were allowed to move. The last conformer was then solvated in a 10-Å-thick TIP3P water shell. Energy minimization of the ligand, of the MHC-ligand complex, followed by 200-ps molecular dynamics simulation of the fully solvated MHC-ligand pair was performed as previously reported (20Rognan D. Scapozza L. Folkers G. Daser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ligands 1–8 (TableII) were obtained by automated solid-phase peptide synthesis using a Fmoc/tert-butyl protecting strategy. Chain elongation was performed by a robot system (Syro Multi-Syn-Tech, Bochum, Germany) with a subsequent manual deprotection and analysis. Fmoc-protected amino acids were coupled to the diisopropylcarbodiimide-activated carboxyl terminus in 10-fold excess using 1-hydroxybenzotriazole as a coupling reagent. The final peptide was simultaneously cleaved from the resin and deprotected by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid with thiocresole and thioanisole as scavengers. The peptides were precipitated and washed with ice-cold ether and further lyophilized from water. Natural as well as nonnatural peptides were analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Merck-Hitachi, Darmstadt, Germany) on a nucleosil 5μ, C-18 column (125 × 3 mm) at a flow rate of 600 μl/min. Absorbance was measured at 220 nm. The solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (buffer A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (buffer B). A linear gradient from 10 to 60% B in 30 min was applied. Furthermore, peptides were analyzed by ion spray mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, APII III, with a mass range of m/z10–2400 equipped with an ion spray interface (Sciex, Thornhill, Canada). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode under conditions of unit mass resolution for all determinations.Table II Open table in a new tab The synthesis of ligands 9–12 will be reported elsewhere. 2D. Seebach, S. Poenaru, G. Folkers, and D. Rognan, manuscript in preparation. The quantitative assay used was described previously (30Galocha B. Lamas J.R. Villadangos J.A. Albar J.P. López de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, RMA-S transfectants expressing B*2705 or B*2704 were used. These are murine cells with impaired TAP-mediated peptide transport and low surface expression of (empty) class I MHC molecules, which can be induced at 26 °C (31Ljunggren H.G. Stam N.J. Ohlen C. Neefjes J.J. Hoglund P. Heemels M.T. Bastin J. Schumacher T.N. Townsend A. Karre K. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1990; 346: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) and stabilized at the cell surface through binding of exogenously added ligands. These cells were incubated at 26 °C for 24 h. After this, they were incubated 1 h at 26 °C with 10−4to 10−9m peptides, transferred to 37 °C, and collected for flow microcytometry analysis with the ME1 monoclonal antibody (IgG1, specific for HLA-B27, -B7, and -B22) (32Ellis S.A. Taylor C. McMichael A. Hum. Immunol. 1982; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) after 4 h for B*2705 or after 2 h for B*2704. The determinant recognized by ME1 is not affected by bound peptides or by polymorphism in these two subtypes (data not shown). Binding of a given ligand was measured as its C50. This is its molar concentration at 50% of the fluorescence obtained with that ligand at 10−4m. Ligands with C50 ≤ 5 μm were considered to bind with high affinity, since these were the values obtained for most of the natural B27-bound peptides. C50values between 5 and 50 μm were considered to reflect intermediate affinity. C50 ≥ 50 μm indicated low affinity. Binding of peptide analogs was measured as the concentration of the peptide analog required to obtain the fluorescence value at the C50 of the unchanged peptide. This was designated as EC50. Relative binding was the ratio between the EC50 of the peptide analog and the C50 of the corresponding unchanged peptide. A cDNA encoding for human β2-microglobulin (gift of Dr. C. Vilches, Clinica Puerta de Hierro, Madrid) was cloned into a pGex vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), yielding a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. Escherichia coli cells transformed with this pGex vector were grown under vigorous shaking in LB broth for 24 h at 25 °C after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were frozen at −70 °C, thawed, suspended in TBS (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and lysed by the addition of lysozyme and brief sonication. The crude extract was passed over a glutathione-agarose column (Sigma), and after extensive washing with TBS, the β2-microglobulin was eluted by thrombin cleavage as a single band at 11 kDa (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The HLA-B*2705 heavy chain was affinity-purified under denaturing conditions as a His6 fusion protein. The expression vector was obtained by subcloning the cDNA encoding for the first extracellular 274 amino acids (gift of Dr. K. C. Parker, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) into the polycloning site of the oligohistidine vector pQE30 (Quiagen) with the restriction endonucleases BamHI and HindIII. The heavy chain was expressed in E. coli at 35 °C for 2 h after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Longer expression times led to an increase of immature or degraded heavy chains. Inclusion bodies were prepared using a standard procedure (33Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 131: 266-280Google Scholar) and solubilized in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl at pH 8.0. Purification on a nickel-nitriloacetate-agarose column led to the HLA-B*2705 heavy chain with two minor impurities of lower molecular weights consisting of truncated heavy chains. Reconstitution of the heavy chain-β2-microglobulin-ligand heterotrimer was achieved by dialysis (cellulose ester tubings, 500-Da cut-off) of a solution containing 0.15 mg/ml heavy chain, 0.1 mg/ml β2-microglobulin, and 0.1 mg/ml peptide ligand, using 5 mm glutathione to establish reducing conditions in 6m urea against TBS. The solution was sparged with nitrogen to prevent premature formation of disulfide bridges and oxidation of free Cys67 in the B*2705 heavy chain. After 36–48 h at 10 °C, the mixture was concentrated to 500 μl in a Centripep ultrafiltration unit (Amicon-Grace Ltd.). The folded heterotrimer was purified by gel filtration on a superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with UV detection at 280 nm. The chromatogram showed three major peaks at 9-, 11.5-, and 14-ml elution volume corresponding to heavy chain aggregates, refolded complex, and excess β2-microglobulin, respectively. The overall yield of the fully reconstituted heterotrimer varied around 5%. The heterotrimer peak was collected, concentrated in a Centricon 30 ultrafiltration unit (Amicon-Grace), and immediately subjected to thermal denaturation. All CD measurements were done on a Jasco J-720 polarimeter with a water-jacketed 1-mm sample cell connected to a computer-interfaced Neslab 111 circulating water bath. Temperature control was achieved by measuring the circulating water immediately after the sample cell. The thermal denaturation profiles were recorded at 218 nm in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) with the Jasco TEMPSCAN software using 0.1 °C increments at a heating rate of 30 °C/h. Sample concentrations were determined photometrically and held at 0.2 mg/ml. Different scan rates did not affect the Tm value of B*2705 in complex with a reference peptide (GRAFVTIGK; compare Ref. 34Weiss G.A. Valentekovich R.J. Collins E.J. Garboczi D.N. Lane W.S.

Three denaturation curves from independent refolding preparations were averaged, after conversion to molar ellipticity values. The curves were reduced to 70 data points by replacing each of the 10 neighboring points with their mean value. By assuming a two-state equilibrium (35Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 265: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), data were fitted by a nonlinear least-squares routine with the program Origin 2.9 (MicroCal Software, Inc.) to the following equations. Θ(T)=Θu+(Θf−Θu/1+exp(x))Equation 1 x=(−ΔHm/R)(1/T−1/Tm)+(ΔCp/R)((Tm/T−1)+ln(T/Tm))Equation 2 The measured ellipticity (Θ) is given as a function of the temperature (T) with the enthalpy (ΔH m), heat capacity upon unfolding (ΔC p), and the midpoint temperature of unfolding (Tm) being the fitting parameters. Initial estimates for ΔH m were obtained by plotting ln K versus 1/T (van't Hoff plot) in the transition region. ΔC p was assumed to be temperature-independent (36Privalov P.L. Gill S.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 191-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), and initial values were estimated from the primary sequence (37Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2138-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). The linear base-line functions of the unfolded and folded states Θu and Θf were determined as linear regressions of the pre- and post-transitional regions. The enthalpy change at the midpoint of unfolding (ΔH m) was determined by the least-squares fit of the unfolding curve to Equation 1. Because ΔC pestimates obtained by this approach are not very accurate and the ΔH m values are largely influenced by the observed deviations from a two-state model, a direct extrapolation from the midpoint of unfolding to obtain ΔΔGunfoldingat 25 °C was not taken into consideration. For mimicking the sequence of the central pentapeptide part (P4–P8) of MHC-bound nonapeptides, any nonpeptidic fragment needs first to reproduce as closely as possible the conformation of this bulging part and second to allow the same intermolecular distance between the neighboring anchoring positions (P3 and P9) that are linked by the new spacer. The key distance between C-α atoms of P3 and P9 positions is 16.6 Å in the x-ray structure of HLA-B*2705 complexed by a nonapeptide model (3Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The same distance can be easily obtained after linking a polymethylene chain (Aua, Fig. 1) to P3 and P9 residues by simple amide bonds. The 11-amino undecanoate fragment was then chosen for its optimal length in an extended conformation and the absence of any substituents, which should allow a conformational flexibility sufficient for a proper fit into the binding groove. To check the independence of the proposed modification on the parent epitope sequence, the Aua spacer was introduced in four unrelated sequences of natural epitopes, known to bind to B*2705 (Table II). The question of whether the new ligands were able to remain tightly bound in the peptide binding cleft like the natural nonapeptides was addressed by molecular dynamics simulations of the solvated complexes (Table II). The computational protocol used has been previously shown to explain the binding potency of several HLA-B27-binding peptides (38Rognan D. Scapozza L. Folkers G. Daser A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11476-11485Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and to predict the high affinity of designed peptide analogues (20Rognan D. Scapozza L. Folkers G. Daser A. Proc. Natl.

Des. 1997; 11: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Energy-minimized conformations show that the proposed bridging has modified neither the overall conformation of the bound ligands nor the intermolecular distance between P3 and P9 C-α atoms (Fig. 2). Moreover, the chemical substitutions were compatible with the conservation of the main interactions between the altered peptides and B*2705, especially the electrostatic interactions provided by the two charged termini and the arginine found at position 2 of B*2705-binding peptides (39Jardetzky T.S. Lane W.S. Robinson R.A. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 40Rötzschke O. Falk K. Stevanovic S. Gnau V. Jung G. Rammensee H.G.

These structures represent energy-minimized conformations obtained from the x-ray structure of HLA-B*2705 in complex with a model peptide (Protein Data Bank entry1hsa) under a previously described protocol (20Rognan D. Scapozza L. Folkers G. Daser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Rognan D. Krebs S. Kuonen O. Lamas J.R. López de Castro J.A. Folkers G.

The heavy chain backbone atoms of HLA-B*2705 have first been fitted together in the four complexes, and the protein atoms are not shown for the sake of clarity. Since protein distortion upon energy minimization of the resulting complexes is minimal, the MHC protein is here represented by a unique molecular surface independent of the bound ligand. The color coding is as follows: blue, nitrogen; red, oxygen; white, carbon atoms of ligand 7; cyan, carbon atoms of ligand 8; green, carbon atoms of ligand 9;yellow, carbon atoms of ligand 10. The arrowsindicate two methyl substituents of the HB tetramer interacting with the central pockets C/E of the protein. The figure has been prepared using the program GRASP (51Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to experimentally validate the proposed model, the four B*2705-restricted T cell epitopes and their modified analogues (TableII) were synthesized and then tested for their binding to B*2705, in anin vitro epitope stabilization assay (30Galocha B. Lamas J.R. Villadangos J.A. Albar J.P. López de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Replacing the central pentapeptide sequence by the unsubstituted Aua fragment led in all cases to a slight decrease in B*2705 stabilization (Table II), which was also reflected by a lesser thermal stability of the resulting complexes monitored by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3, A–D). The temperature shift in the midpoint of unfolding depends on the sequence of the reference peptide but varies from −7 to −14 °C (Table II). Whereas the effect of the Aua spacer is similar in both assays, there seems to be no clear correlation between the EC50 scores obtained from the epitope stabilization assay and the Tm values calculated from the thermal denaturation experiments. The Tm values reported here are fairly similar to those found for B*2705-binding peptides by other groups (21Weiss G.A. Collins E.J. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Weiss G.A. Valentekovich R.J. Collins E.J. Garboczi D.N. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A. 1997; 94: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The highest stability against temperature was found for complexes with peptides 5 and 7, which all present a lysine at P9. Less favored amino acids at P9 are Val (peptides 1 and 2) and especially Arg (peptides 3 and 4), which gives by far the least stable complexes with B*2705 (peptides 1 and 3, respectively). Binding of peptides 1–6 to a closely related HLA-B27 subtype (B*2704) was also examined by the same in vitro stabilization assay. B*2704 differs from B*2705 by two amino acid changes in the peptide binding groove (Asp77 to Ser; Val152 to Glu), which influence its peptide specificity, relative to B*2705 (42Garcia F. Marina A. López de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 49: 215-221Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast to B*2705, substitution of Aua spacers for P4–P8 dramatically decreases binding to B*2704 in our epitope stabilization assay (TableII) when the last anchoring position (P9) is a basic amino acid (Lys, Arg). If P9 is an apolar residue (Val, peptide 2), no real change in B*2704 binding was noticed. The decreased binding of the Aua analogues to B*2705 is probably due to the nonfunctionalized nature of the introduced spacer and the lack of interactions between the unsubstituted Aua moiety and the central part of the binding groove. Thus, a rational improvement in terms of binding affinity would be to ramify the spacing moiety in order to reach one of the two central pockets (pockets C and E) of the peptide binding groove that f"

Biosynthetic labeling of GAGs with [<sup>35</sup>S]sulfate <i>in vitro</i> is shown to have an absolute requirement for ATP and cytosolic proteins and is inhibited by dismantling the Golgi apparatus with okadaic acid or under mitotic conditions suggesting that inter-compartmental transport between Golgi cisternae is a prerequisite for the successful completion of the initiation, polymerization, and sulfation of GAGs.

https://openalex.org/W2056214973,"The PSI-C subunit of photosystem I (PS I) shows similarity to soluble 2[4Fe–4S] ferredoxins. PSI-C contains an eight residue internal loop and a 15 residue C-terminal extension which are absent in the ferredoxins. The eight-residue loop has been shown to interact with PSI-A/PSI-B (Naver, H., Scott, M. P., Golbeck, J. H., Moller, B. L., and Scheller, H. V. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 8996–9001). Four mutant proteins were constructed. Two were modified barley PSI-C proteins, one lacking the loop and the C terminus (PSI-Ccore) and one where the loop replace the C-terminal extension (PSI-CcoreLc-term). Two were modifiedClostridium pasteurianum ferredoxins, one with the loop of barley PSI-C and one with both the loop and the C terminus of PSI-C. Wild-type proteins and the mutants were used to reconstitute barley P700-FX cores lacking PSI-C, -D, and-E. Western blotting showed that PSI-CcoreLc-term binds to PS I, whereas PSI-Ccore does not. Without PSI-D the PSI-CcoreLc-term mutant accepts electrons from FX in contrast to PSI-C mutants without the loop. Flash photolysis of P700-FX cores reconstituted with C. pasteurianum ferredoxin showed that only the ferredoxin mutants with the loop accepted electrons from FX. From this, it is concluded that the loop of PSI-C is necessary and sufficient for the association between PS I and PSI-C, and that the loop is functional as an interaction domain even when positioned at the C terminus of PSI-C or on a low molecular mass, soluble ferredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W2058331544,"Abstract We have semi-synthesized 18 species of mixed chain phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) in which the sn-1 acyl chain is derived from stearic, arachidic, and behenic acids, and thesn-2 acyl chain is originated fromcis,cis-octadecadienoic andcis,cis-eicosadienoic acids with the two methylene-interrupted double bonds located at various positions. These PEs constituting the bilayers in the aqueous dispersion were subjected to differential scanning calorimetric experiments. TheT m values associated with the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transitions for these PEs are found to be significantly smaller than those of the saturated counterparts. Moreover, the magnitude of the T m-lowering effect of acyl chain diunsaturation depends critically on the positions of the two methylene-interrupted cis double bonds in thesn-2 acyl chain. Specifically, if the sn-2 acyl chain is derived from cis,cis-octadecadienoic acid, the T m-lowering effect has the following decreasing order: Δ9,12 > Δ6,9 > Δ12,15. For cis,cis-eicosadienoyl acyl chain, the T m-lowering effect is stronger in the order of Δ10,13 > Δ11,14 > Δ8,11 > Δ5,8 > Δ14,17. Finally, a refined molecular model is presented that can adequately explain the T m-lowering effect of sn-2 acyl chain diunsaturation. Moreover, this same refined molecular model can also be invoked to better interpret theT m-lowering effect observed for sn-1 saturated/sn-2 monoenoic PE."
