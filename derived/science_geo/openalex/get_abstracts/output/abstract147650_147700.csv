https://openalex.org/W2157915068,"How does imitation occur? How can the motor plans necessary for imitating an action derive from the observation of that action? Imitation may be based on a mechanism directly matching the observed action onto an internal motor representation of that action (""direct matching hypothesis""). To test this hypothesis, normal human participants were asked to observe and imitate a finger movement and to perform the same movement after spatial or symbolic cues. Brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. If the direct matching hypothesis is correct, there should be areas that become active during finger movement, regardless of how it is evoked, and their activation should increase when the same movement is elicited by the observation of an identical movement made by another individual. Two areas with these properties were found in the left inferior frontal cortex (opercular region) and the rostral-most region of the right superior parietal lobule."
https://openalex.org/W2084452119,"Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are endothelial cell–specific growth factors. Direct comparison of transgenic mice overexpressing these factors in the skin revealed that the VEGF-induced blood vessels were leaky, whereas those induced by Ang1 were nonleaky. Moreover, vessels in Ang1-overexpressing mice were resistant to leaks caused by inflammatory agents. Coexpression of Ang1 and VEGF had an additive effect on angiogenesis but resulted in leakage-resistant vessels typical of Ang1. Ang1 therefore may be useful for reducing microvascular leakage in diseases in which the leakage results from chronic inflammation or elevated VEGF and, in combination with VEGF, for promoting growth of nonleaky vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2015087988,"The ability of morphine to alleviate pain is mediated through a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein)-coupled heptahelical receptor (GPCR), the mu opioid receptor (muOR). The efficiency of GPCR signaling is tightly regulated and ultimately limited by the coordinated phosphorylation of the receptors by specific GPCR kinases and the subsequent interaction of the phosphorylated receptors with beta-arrestin 1 and beta-arrestin 2. Functional deletion of the beta-arrestin 2 gene in mice resulted in remarkable potentiation and prolongation of the analgesic effect of morphine, suggesting that muOR desensitization was impaired. These results provide evidence in vivo for the physiological importance of beta-arrestin 2 in regulating the function of a specific GPCR, the muOR. Moreover, they suggest that inhibition of beta-arrestin 2 function might lead to enhanced analgesic effectiveness of morphine and provide potential new avenues for the study and treatment of pain, narcotic tolerance, and dependence."

https://openalex.org/W2166548889,"The hCHK2 gene encodes the human homolog of the yeast Cds1 and Rad53 G2 checkpoint kinases, whose activation in response to DNA damage prevents cellular entry into mitosis. Here, it is shown that heterozygous germ line mutations in hCHK2 occur in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a highly penetrant familial cancer phenotype usually associated with inherited mutations in the TP53 gene. These observations suggest that hCHK2 is a tumor suppressor gene conferring predisposition to sarcoma, breast cancer, and brain tumors, and they also provide a link between the central role of p53 inactivation in human cancer and the well-defined G2 checkpoint in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2058769115,"Compounds that stabilize the DNA binding domain of p53 in the active conformation were identified. These small synthetic molecules not only promoted the stability of wild-type p53 but also allowed mutant p53 to maintain an active conformation. A prototype compound caused the accumulation of conformationally active p53 in cells with mutant p53, enabling it to activate transcription and to slow tumor growth in mice. With further work aimed at improving potency, this class of compounds may be developed into anticancer drugs of broad utility."

https://openalex.org/W2915880292,"Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is unique among plant model organisms in having a small genome (130-140 Mb), excellent physical and genetic maps, and little repetitive DNA. Here we report the sequence of chromosome 2 from the Columbia ecotype in two gap-free assemblies (contigs) of 3.6 and 16 megabases (Mb). The latter represents the longest published stretch of uninterrupted DNA sequence assembled from any organism to date. Chromosome 2 represents 15% of the genome and encodes 4,037 genes, 49% of which have no predicted function. Roughly 250 tandem gene duplications were found in addition to large-scale duplications of about 0.5 and 4.5 Mb between chromosomes 2 and 1 and between chromosomes 2 and 4, respectively. Sequencing of nearly 2 Mb within the genetically defined centromere revealed a low density of recognizable genes, and a high density and diverse range of vestigial and presumably inactive mobile elements. More unexpected is what appears to be a recent insertion of a continuous stretch of 75% of the mitochondrial genome into chromosome 2."

https://openalex.org/W1524412093,"Voltage-gated ion channels are transmembrane proteins that are essential for nerve impulses and regulate ion flow across cell membranes in response to changes in membrane potential. They are made up of four homologous domains or subunits, each of which contains six transmembrane segments. Studies of potassium channels have shown that the second (S2) and fourth (S4) segments contain several charged residues, which sense changes in voltage and form part of the voltage sensor. Although these regions clearly undergo conformational changes in response to voltage, little is known about the nature of these changes because voltage-dependent distance changes have not been measured. Here we use lanthanide-based resonance energy transfer to measure distances between Shaker potassium channel subunits at specific residues. Voltage-dependent distance changes of up to 3.2 A were measured at several sites near the S4 segment. These movements directly correlated with electrical measurements of the voltage sensor, establishing the link between physical changes and electrical charge movement. Measured distance changes suggest that the region associated with the S4 segment undergoes a rotation and possible tilt, rather than a large transmembrane movement, in response to voltage. These results demonstrate the first in situ measurement of atomic scale movement in a trans-membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W2085042131,"Since the invention of quantum mechanics, even the simplest example of the collisional breakup of a system of charged particles, e − + H → H + + e − + e − (where e − is an electron and H is hydrogen), has resisted solution and is now one of the last unsolved fundamental problems in atomic physics. A complete solution requires calculation of the energies and directions for a final state in which all three particles are moving away from each other. Even with supercomputers, the correct mathematical description of this state has proved difficult to apply. A framework for solving ionization problems in many areas of chemistry and physics is finally provided by a mathematical transformation of the Schrödinger equation that makes the final state tractable, providing the key to a numerical solution of this problem that reveals its full dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2050252881,"The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade is inactivated at the level of MAP kinase by members of the MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP) family, including MKP-1. MKP-1 was a labile protein in CCL39 hamster fibroblasts; its degradation was attenuated by inhibitors of the ubiquitin-directed proteasome complex. MKP-1 was a target in vivo and in vitro for p42(MAPK) or p44(MAPK), which phosphorylates MKP-1 on two carboxyl-terminal serine residues, Serine 359 and Serine 364. This phosphorylation did not modify MKP-1's intrinsic ability to dephosphorylate p44(MAPK) but led to stabilization of the protein. These results illustrate the importance of regulated protein degradation in the control of mitogenic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2129774153,"High-precision genetic mapping was used to define the regions that contain centromere functions on each natural chromosome in Arabidopsis thaliana. These regions exhibited dramatic recombinational repression and contained complex DNA surrounding large arrays of 180-base pair repeats. Unexpectedly, the DNA within the centromeres was not merely structural but also encoded several expressed genes. The regions flanking the centromeres were densely populated by repetitive elements yet experienced normal levels of recombination. The genetically defined centromeres were well conserved among Arabidopsis ecotypes but displayed limited sequence homology between different chromosomes, excluding repetitive DNA. This investigation provides a platform for dissecting the role of individual sequences in centromeres in higher eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2061764511,"Mice lacking mCry1 and mCry2 are behaviorally arrhythmic. As shown here, cyclic expression of the clock genes mPer1 and mPer2 (mammalian Period genes 1 and 2) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissues is abolished and mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA levels are constitutively high. These findings indicate that the biological clock is eliminated in the absence of both mCRY1 and mCRY2 (mammalian cryptochromes 1 and 2) and support the idea that mammalian CRY proteins act in the negative limb of the circadian feedback loop. The mCry double-mutant mice retain the ability to have mPer1 and mPer2 expression induced by a brief light stimulus known to phase-shift the biological clock in wild-type animals. Thus, mCRY1 and mCRY2 are dispensable for light-induced phase shifting of the biological clock."

https://openalex.org/W1963561392,"Phytochromes are a family of photoreceptors used by green plants to entrain their development to the light environment. The distribution of these chromoproteins has been expanded beyond photoautotrophs with the discovery of phytochrome-like proteins in the nonphotosynthetic eubacteria Deinococcus radiodurans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Like plant phytochromes, the D. radiodurans receptor covalently binds linear tetrapyrroles autocatalytically to generate a photochromic holoprotein. However, the attachment site is distinct, using a histidine to potentially form a Schiff base linkage. Sequence homology and mutational analysis suggest that D. radiodurans bacteriophytochrome functions as a light-regulated histidine kinase, which helps protect the bacterium from visible light."
https://openalex.org/W1517532080,"Recombination between repeated sequences at various loci of the human genome are known to give rise to DNA rearrangements associated with many genetic disorders. Perhaps the most extensively characterized genomic region prone to rearrangement is 17p12, which is associated with the peripheral neuropathies, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A;ref. 2). Homologous recombination between 24-kb flanking repeats, termed CMT1A-REPs, results in a 1.5-Mb deletion that is associated with HNPP, and the reciprocal duplication product is associated with CMT1A (ref. 2). Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a multiple congenital anomalies, mental retardation syndrome associated with a chromosome 17 microdeletion, del(17)(p11.2p11.2) (ref. 3,4). Most patients (>90%) carry deletions of the same genetic markers and define a common deletion. We report seven unrelated patients with de novo duplications of the same region deleted in SMS. A unique junction fragment, of the same apparent size, was identified in each patient by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Further molecular analyses suggest that the de novo17p11.2 duplication is preferentially paternal in origin, arises from unequal crossing over due to homologous recombination between flanking repeat gene clusters and probably represents the reciprocal recombination product of the SMS deletion. The clinical phenotype resulting from duplication [dup(17)(p11.2p11.2)] is milder than that associated with deficiency of this genomic region. This mechanism of reciprocal deletion and duplication via homologous recombination may not only pertain to the 17p11.2 region, but may also be common to other regions of the genome where interstitial microdeletion syndromes have been defined."

Individuals affected with LCA are diagnosed at birth or in the first few months of life with severely impaired vision or blindness, nystagmus and an abnormal or flat electroretinogram (ERG). Mutations in GUCY2D (ref. 3), RPE65 (ref. 4) and CRX (ref. 5) are known to cause LCA, but one study identified disease-causing GUCY2D mutations in only 8 of 15 families whose LCA locus maps to 17p13.1 (ref. 3), suggesting another LCA locus might be located on 17p13.1. Confirming this prediction, the LCA in one Pakistani family mapped to 17p13.1, between D17S849 and D17S960—a region that excludes GUCY2D. The LCA in this family has been designated LCA4 (ref. 6). We describe here a new photoreceptor/pineal-expressed gene, AIPL1 (encoding aryl-hydrocarbon interacting protein-like 1), that maps within the LCA4 candidate region and whose protein contains three tetratricopeptide (TPR) motifs, consistent with nuclear transport or chaperone activity. A homozygous nonsense mutation at codon 278 is present in all affected members of the original LCA4 family. AIPL1 mutations may cause approximately 20% of recessive LCA, as disease-causing mutations were identified in 3 of 14 LCA families not tested previously for linkage."

https://openalex.org/W2006384398,"Mortality rates typically increase rapidly at the onset of aging but can decelerate at later ages. Reproduction increases the death rate in many organisms. To test the idea that a delayed impact of earlier reproduction contributes to both an increase in death rates and a later deceleration in mortality, the timing of the surplus mortality produced by an increased level of egg production was measured in female Drosophila . Reproduction produced a delayed wave of mortality, coincident with the sharp increase in death rates at the onset of aging and the subsequent deceleration of mortality. These results suggest that aging has evolved primarily because of the damaging effects of reproduction earlier in life, rather than because of mutations that have detrimental effects only at late ages."

This evidence is reconciled with previous indications of high productivity by invoking a model of sapropel formation in which increased river discharge facilitates development of a specialized phytoplankton population whose annual mass sinking provides the organic flux to generate sapropels. This interpretation is consistent with the widespread occurrence of mat-forming diatoms that thrive in stratified water and can harbor diazotrophic bacterial symbionts, but does not support eutrophication of surface waters by enhanced river runoff or a circulation reversal."

Here functional imaging is used to address this issue by measuring brain activity for unattended words. When attention is fully engaged with other material, the brain no longer differentiates between meaningful words and random letters, even when they are looked at directly. These results demonstrate true inattentional blindness for words and show that visual recognition wholly depends on attention even for highly familiar and meaningful stimuli at the center of gaze."
https://openalex.org/W2145914350,"Adenine deoxynucleosides, such as 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2CdA) and fludarabine, induce apoptosis in quiescent lymphocytes, and are thus useful drugs for the treatment of indolent lymphoproliferative diseases. We previously demonstrated that that the 5'-triphosphate metabolite of 2CdA (2CdATP), similar to dATP, can cooperate with cytochrome c and apoptosis protein-activating factor-1 (APAF-1) to trigger a caspase pathway in a HeLa cell-free system. We used a fluorometry-based assay of caspase activation to extend the analysis to several other clinically relevant adenine deoxynucleotides in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia extracts. The nucleotide-induced caspase activation displayed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. As estimated by the V(max)/K(m) ratios, the relative efficiencies of different nucleotides were Ara-ATP > 9-fluoro-9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-triphosphate > dATP > 2CdATP > 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine 5'-triphosphate > dADP > ATP. In contrast to dADP, both ADP and its nonhydrolyzable alpha, beta-methylphosphonate analog were strong inhibitors of APAF-1-dependent caspase activation. The hierarchy of nucleotide activation was confirmed in a fully reconstituted system using recombinant APAF-1 and recombinant procaspase-9. These results suggest that the potency of adenine deoxynucleotides as co-factors for APAF-1-dependent caspase activation is due both to stimulation by the 5'-triphosphates and lack of inhibition by the 5'-diphosphates. The capacity of adenine deoxynucleoside metabolites to activate the apoptosome pathway may be an additional biochemical mechanism that plays a role in the chemotherapy of indolent lymphoproliferative diseases."

The impurity spin susceptibility has a Curie-like divergence at the quantum-critical coupling, but with a universal effective spin that is neither an integer nor a half-odd integer. In the Néel state, the transverse impurity susceptibility is a universal number divided by the host spin stiffness (which determines the energy cost to slow twists in the orientation of the Néel order). These and numerous other results for the thermodynamics, Knight shift, and magnon damping have important applications in experiments on layered transition metal oxides."
https://openalex.org/W2140796853,"Renin plays a key role in controlling blood pressure through its specific cleavage of angiotensinogen to generate angiotensin I (AI). Although possible existence of the other angiotensin forming enzymes has been discussed to date, its in vivo function remains to be elucidated. To address the contribution of renin, we generated renin knockout mice. Homozygous mutant mice show neither detectable levels of plasma renin activity nor plasma AI, lowered blood pressure 20–30 mm Hg less than normal, increased urine and drinking volume, and altered renal morphology as those observed in angiotensinogen-deficient mice. We recently found the decreased density in granular layer cells of hippocampus and the impaired blood-brain barrier function in angiotensinogen-deficient mice.

The biologically inactive decapeptide AI is then converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to the effector molecule angiotensin II (AII). The RA system plays a key role in the control of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis as well as the pathogenesis of several diseases, including hypertension (1Fukamizu A. Murakami K. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 6: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Renin is synthesized principally in the kidney juxtaglomerular cells, are in close contact with the macula densa that signals to the renal arterioles to regulate glomerular filtration rate and the secretion of renin (2Skott O. Briggs J.P. Science. 1987; 237: 1618-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This system was originally believed to be exclusively a circulating system, but because components of the RA system have been demonstrated in a variety of tissues, the local RA system has been proposed as a paracrine function with a physiological importance to the tissues in which it is expressed (3Phillips M.I. Speakman E.A. Kimura B. Regul. Pept. 1993; 43: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The brain is of particular interest with regard to the local RA system, because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents the penetration of all components and products of this system in the circulation. It is well established that the injection of AII into the brain causes significant physiological responses (4Wright J.W. Harding J.W. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1992; 17: 227-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Moreover, we recently reported the importance of angiotensin fragments in maintaining the structure of hippocampus and the BBB function by analyzing angiotensinogen-deficient (Agt−/−) mice (5Kakinuma Y. Hama H. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Goto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1078-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Kakinuma Y. Hama H. Sugiyama F. Goto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 232: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although all the components are present for the RA system in the brain, the mismatch distribution of each component can be observed. The major gap in such evidence is the role of renin. The brain expresses mRNA for renin but the levels are very low and the distribution is dissimilar to the distribution of angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin immunoreactivity (7Bunnemann B. Fuxe K. Ganten D. Regul. Pept. 1993; 46: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). There are several explanations for the lack of abundant renin in the brain, but the true answer remains to be defined. We and other groups reported that Agt−/− mice exhibit several abnormal phenotypes (5Kakinuma Y. Hama H. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Goto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nat.

Of note, these mouse strains have duplicated renin genes,Ren-1D and Ren-2, encoding highly homologous proteins with approximately 97% similarity at the amino acid level. It is conceivable that the inactivation of a specific renin leads to activation of the others in a compensatory manner, thereby minimizing manifestation of abnormalities. Therefore, the role of renin in the RA system remains to be elucidated. To address this question, we generated complete renin-deficient mice and suggest dispensable and indispensable roles for renin in vivo. The Ren-1CDNA was cloned from strain-C57BL/6 genomic library. AnNcoI site was created at the translation initiation codon of the gene and then the NcoI/KpnI fragment of the gene was replaced with the lacZ cassette (15Saga Y. Yagi T. Ikawa Y. Sakakura T. Aizawa S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1821-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene cassette derived from pMC1neo (Stratagene) was placed downstream of the lacZ gene. The 7.5-kb KpnI/NcoI fragment and the 4.5-kbKpnI/XhoI fragment of the Ren-1C gene were included upstream and downstream of these cassettes, respectively. The negative selection with the DT-A cassette are described elsewhere (16Yagi T. Nada S. Watanabe N. Tamemoto H. Kohmura N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The targeted TT2 ES cells were grown on feeder cells as described elsewhere (17Yagi T. Tokunaga T. Furuta Y. Nada S. Yoshida M. Tsukada T. Saga Y. Takeda N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination was detected by Southern blotting. Chimeric mice were generated by injecting the ES cells into ICR eight-cell embryos. Blood samples were withdrawn from mice (32–36 days) under pentobarbital anesthesia and collected into ice-cold tubes containing EDTA, which were immediately centrifuged. Plasma renin activity was estimated by measuring the rate of AI formation with the subsequently generated AI being quantitated by radioimmunoassay (18Fukamizu A. Sugimura K. Takimoto E. Sugiyama F.

The concentration of angiotensinogen was determined by measurement of the amount of angiotensin I released by use of an excess of mouse submandibular gland renin. The systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressure were measured by a programmable sphygmomanometer (BP-98A; Softron, Japan) using the tail-cuff method as described previously (8Tanimoto K. Sugiyama F.

Statistical analysis for comparison of blood pressure was performed by using Student's t test. Urine collection and measurement of drinking water was performed for 5 days. Statistical analysis used unpaired Student's t test. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Two micrometer serial paraffin sections prepared by a routine procedure were stained using anti-mouse submandibular gland renin antiserum (8Tanimoto K. Sugiyama F. Goto Y. Ishida J. Takimoto E.

Inc., South San Francisco, CA), or anti-PGP9.5 (UltraClone Limited, UK). Control sections were incubated with preabsorbed antiserum or nonimmunized rabbit serum substituted for the primary antiserum. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed with a JEM-1210 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) at 100 kV. Cold injury was conducted as described previously (5Kakinuma Y. Hama H. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Goto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1078-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). An inbred mouse strain, C57BL/6, has the single renin gene, termed Ren-1C, whereas CBA possesses the two renin genes, termed Ren-1D andRen-2. We generated renin-deficient mice with targeted replacement of the Ren-1C loci by the lacZ gene in the TT2 ES cells derived from an F1 embryo between C57BL/6 and CBA mice (17Yagi T. Tokunaga T.

Male chimeras derived from the stem cells were mated with C57BL/6 females to obtain heterozygous F1 hybrids (renin1C/−), and heterozygous progeny were intercrossed to produce renin−/−. Our previous study showed that almost Agt−/− mice died of renal failure, but most saline-treated animals lived over a year (12Taniguchi K. Sugiyama F. Kakinuma Y. Uehara S. Nishijo N. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Yagami K.I. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 583-587PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent neonatal death, the resulting offsprings were subcutaneously injected dorsally with saline (0.05 ml/g/day) in the 7 days following birth. Without such treatments, renin−/− mice also died within a week after birth (data not shown). The mutated Ren-1C gene was confirmed by genomic Southern and Northern blot analyses (Fig. 1,B and C). To test angiotensin generation in the plasma, blood samples were analyzed by a radioimmunoassay (Table I). Although there was no significant difference between renin1C/1C and renin1C/− mice, the plasma renin activity and the plasma content of AI decreased to below detectable levels, but the plasma angiotensinogen concentration increased in the renin−/−mice.Table IPhysiological analysis of renin 1C/1C, renin 1C/−, and renin −/− miceStudyRenin1C/1CRenin1C/−Renin−/−♂♀♂♀♂♀Plasma renin activity (ng Al/ml/h)18.34 ± 2.55 (n = 5)18.03 ± 4.39 (n = 4)18.02 ± 3.58 (n = 5)22.59 ± 3.04 (n = 4)NDaND, not determined.

Open table in a new tab We measured the systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures of mice at 8 weeks after birth (Table I). The blood pressures between renin1C/1C and renin1C/− mice were indistinguishable, whereas a significant difference in blood pressures was observed in the renin−/− mice, the decreased levels of which were similar to ones of Agt−/− mice (8Tanimoto K.

Renin−/− mice demonstrated major morphological changes in the kidney, i.e. dilated renal pelvis and atrophied of renal parenchyma from the pallia to the outer strip, indicating hydronephrosis (Fig. 2 B), as compared with those of renin1C/1C mice (Fig. 2 A). In renin1C/− mice, macula densa morphology, showing simple plaque of distal tubule cells, was similar to that in wild-type mice (Fig. 2 C and data not shown). Macula densa in renin−/− mice was characterized by the increase in macula densa number (Fig. 2 D) or by the marked accumulation of nuclei like as pseudostratified epithelium (Fig. 2 E). Electron microscopy demonstrated that the juxtaglomerular cells of the renin−/− mice were completely devoid of the storage/secretory granules typically present in wild-type controls (Fig. 2, F and G). Immunohistochemical studies revealed that vascular poles of the glomeruli were positive for renin in the kidney of renin1C/1C and renin1C/−mice, but negative in the renin−/− mice (Fig. 3 A). The serial section stainings using anti-lacZ showed no signal in the renin1C/1C kidney, but the colocalization of renin and β-galactosidase in the renin1C/− kidney. These results indicate the correctly regulated lacZ expression under control of the endogenous renin promoter. In the renin−/−kidney, lacZ signals were observed in hyperplastic vascular smooth muscle cells. For α-SMA, the vascular smooth muscle cells of renin−/− mice were stained weakly, although those of the renin1C/1C and renin1C/− ones were stained in a diffuse and fine granular manner.FIG. 3A, immunohistological analysis. In the renin1C/1C and renin1C/− kidney, vascular poles of the glomeruli were immunologically stained for renin (renin), but those were negative in the renin−/− ones at all. Renin−/− mice expressed β-galactosidase in association with thickening of the vascular wall, whereas in renin1C/− mice, LacZ positive cells were limited to cells of the juxtaglomerular cell apparatus. For α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), the vascular smooth muscle cells of renin−/− mice were stained weakly, though those of the renin1C/1C and renin1C/− ones were stained in a diffuse and fine granular manner. Scale bar, 50 μm. B, immunohistological analysis using anti-PGP9.5 antiserum. In the kidney of renin1C/1C and renin1C/− mice, a few nerve fibers constituting the varicosity were scattered along the adventitia of arteriolar vessels.

Scale bar, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the innervation in association with the juxtaglomerular apparatus, the immunohistochemical analysis using an anti-PGP9.5 antiserum, a marker of the nervous and neuroendocrine system, was performed (19Wrobel K.H. Abu-Ghali N. Acta Anat. 1997; 160: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). In the kidney of renin1C/1C and renin1C/− mice, a few nerve fibers constituting the varicosity were scattered along the adventitia of arteriolar vessels. Whereas in the kidney of renin−/−mice, many nerve fibers were noted to distribute along the hypertrophied vessel walls and to localize at the juxtaglomerular apparatus. To study the renal function, we examined drinking intake and urine output (Table I). Drinking and urination were significantly higher in renin−/− mice than the other control mice, indicating that renin−/− mice were polydipsia and polyuria. Recently, we reported the decreased density in the granular layer cells of hippocampus and the impaired BBB function in Agt−/− mice with a C57BL/6J genetic background (5Kakinuma Y. Hama H. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Goto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1078-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Kakinuma Y. Hama H. Sugiyama F. Goto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 232: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To make a comparative study, we re-examined the density in the granular layer cells of the initial line of Agt−/− mice, because Agt−/− mice, like renin−/− mice, were initially produced with a hybrid genetic background using TT2 ES cells (8Tanimoto K. Sugiyama F. Goto Y. Ishida J. Takimoto E. Yagami K. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31334-31337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, hybrid Agt−/− mice revealed a characteristic appearance of granular layer cells, whose nuclei are larger and round shaped with coarse chromatin. The cellular density decreased with less layers, compared with that of wild-type. Moreover, we compared the disruption of the BBB in hybrid Agt−/− mice with that of wild-type mice, using cold injury followed by intraperitoneal injection of Evans blue (Fig. 4 B). Exudation of this dye was evident in the hybrid Agt−/− brain by day 5 after cold injury, indicating that the abnormalities observed in congenic Agt−/− mice are not affected by the genetic background. Surprisingly, however, renin−/− mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice in these phenotypes. We tried to analyze Agt-processing cascade by generating the complete renin-deficient mice with the Ren-1C null mutation in the present study (Fig. 1). Because some mouse strains have duplicated renin genes, phenotypic changes are often obscured by the genetic redundancy when gene knockout technique is applied to this case. As expected, our Ren-1C null mutants considerably differ from the previously reported Ren-1D or Ren-2null mutants (13Sharp M.G. Fettes D. Brooker G. Clark A.F. Peters J. Fleming S. Mullins J.J.

First, the plasma renin activity and the plasma content of immunoreactive AI decreased below detectable level (Table I). Second, the mutant mice showed lowered blood pressure, 20–30 mm Hg less than normal in both sexes (Table I). These observations are identical to those observed in Agt−/−mice (8Tanimoto K. Sugiyama F.

Therefore, we conclude that the renin-dependent classical pathway plays an essential role in generating plasma AI and maintaining blood pressure. Renin has been generally considered to be the only one enzyme processing angiotensinogen in vivo. We demonstrated, however, a dispensable role for renin in the maintenance of density in granular layer cells of hippocampus and the blood-brain barrier function (Fig. 4), but renin is indispensable in the circulating RA system. Although the lack of abundant renin in the brain has been discussed for a long time, these renin-independent brain functions suggests a possible existence of other angiotensinogen processing enzymes. This notion drives us to the question what other enzyme(s) would contribute to the production of angiotensin fragments in the brain. Hackenthal et al. (20Hackenthal E. Hackenthal R. Hilgenfeldt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 10: 574-588Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) purified isorenin from the rat brain that is distinct from renal renin but indistinguishable from cathepsin D. In addition to the classical pathway of AII formation via renin or cathepsin D in association with ACE, cathepsin G and tonin have been shown to generate AII directly from angiotensinogen, suggesting a contribution to AII generation in brain regions without detectable ACE (21Boucher R. Demassieux S. Garcia R. Genest J. Circ. Res. 1977; 4 Suppl. 2: 26-29Crossref Google Scholar, 22Tonnesen M.G. Klempner M.S. Austen K.F. Wintroub B.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Even if these enzymes contribute to angiotensin production, there remains a second question: where is angiotensinogen processed? As these aspartyl proteases have activities only in the acidic condition, the processing event should occur in the cytosolic vesicles (23Inagami T. Misono K. Chang J.-J. Takii Y. Dykes C. Aspartic Proteinases and Their Inhibitors. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1985: 319-337Google Scholar). Interestingly, Moffett et al. (24Moffett R.B. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. Life Sci. 1987; 41: 1867-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) proposed a model of intracellular AII formation in the brain. Further study will define the cascade(s) which are involved in angiotensin generation pathway in the brain. Our renin-deficient mouse line should be an excellent model for understanding a renin-independent pathway(s)in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1990233030,"Two families of transcription factors, myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), function synergistically to regulate myogenesis. In addition to activating structural muscle-specific genes, MRFs and MEF2 activate each other's expression. The MRF, myogenin, can activate MEF2 DNA binding activity when transfected into fibroblasts and, in turn, the myogenin promoter contains essential MEF2 DNA binding elements. To determine which MEF2 is involved in this regulation, P19 cells stably expressing MyoD and myogenin were compared for their ability to activate the expression of MEF2 family members. There was very little cross-activation of MyoD expression by myogenin and vice versa. Myogenin expression, and not MyoD, was found to up-regulate MEF2C expression. MEF2A, -B, and -D expression levels were not up-regulated by overexpression of either MyoD or myogenin. To examine whether MEF2C can differentially regulate MyoD or myogenin expression, P19 cell lines overexpressing MEF2C were analyzed. MEF2C induced myogenesis in P19 cells and up-regulated the expression of myogenin with 25-fold greater efficiency than that of MyoD. Therefore, myogenin and MEF2C participate in a regulatory loop in differentiating stem cells. This positive regulation does not extend to MyoD or the other MEF2 family members.

Mice lacking myogenin produced normal myoblast cells but displayed a marked reduction in secondary myofibers (21Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J.M. Olson E.N. Klein W.H.

Taken together these results indicate that MyoD and myf-5 play a role in the determination of skeletal muscle and that myogenin plays an essential in vivorole in the terminal differentiation of secondary muscle fibers. An essential role for d-MEF2 in the development of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle has been demonstrated by the deficiency of these tissues in Drosophila lacking the single d-mef2 gene (24Lilly B.

During murine somitogenesis, MEF2C is the first MEF2 factor to be expressed in the somite on day 9, just after expression of myogenin (27Edmondson D.G. Lyons G.E. Martin J.F. Olson E.N.

Mice lacking MEF2C die around embryonic day 10 because of a defect in cardiac looping, whereas mice lacking MEF2B are viable and develop normally. A dominant-negative form of MEF2A inhibits the differentiation of myoblast cells, indicating that the trans-activation function of MEF2 proteins is essential for skeletal muscle-specific gene expression (29Ornatsky O.I.

Although it is believed that MEF2 factors are important for amplifying and maintaining the skeletal myogenic program, the specific MEF2 family member involved and whether MEF2 family members are sufficient to induce myogenesis in mammalian cells is unclear. One study (1Kaushal S. Schneider J.W. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Science. 1994; 266: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) demonstrated that MEF2A induced skeletal muscle development in fibroblasts, whereas another study (3Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) found that MEF2A did not, although MRF expression could be activated (24Lilly B. Zhao B. Ranganayakulu G. Paterson B.M. Schulz R.A. Olson E.N. Science. 1995; 267: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In contrast,d-MEF2 activated the expression of skeletal muscle-specific genes when overexpressed at a particular stage of development inDrosophila ectoderm (30Lin M.H. Bour B.A. Abmayr S.M.

Med. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Upon cellular aggregation, P19 cells undergo differentiation that emulates the biochemical and morphological events of early embryonic development (32McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev.

Biol. 1994; 163: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The development of skeletal and cardiac muscle in P19 cells is regulated by unknown components in the fetal calf serum (38Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. In Vitro Cellular and Developmental Biology-Animal. 1999; 35: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). P19 cells aggregated with segments of chick neural tube differentiate into skeletal muscle in the absence of Me2SO, indicating that signals from the neural tube can replace the requirement for Me2SO (39Angello J.C. Stern H.M. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The approach of overexpressing transcription factors in P19 cells has yielded important information about their function and regulation. For example, P19 cells overexpressing either GATA-4 (35Grepin C. Nemer G. Nemer M. Development. 1997; 124: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or MyoD (40Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) differentiate into cardiac muscle or skeletal muscle, respectively, when aggregated in the absence of Me2SO. Using this approach, we have shown recently that MEF2C and Nkx2–5 activate each other's expression and induce cardiomyogenesis in P19 cells aggregated in the absence of Me2SO (36Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Here we set out to determine if MEF2 can initiate myogenesis in differentiating P19 stem cells and to identify the family members that participate in the MRF/MEF2 regulatory loop. We show that MEF2C can induce skeletal myogenesis when overexpressed in differentiating stem cells and that MEF2C and myogenin, but not MyoD or MEF2A, -B, or -D, participate in a regulatory loop. Therefore, MEF2C appears to play a specific role in early events of myogenesis. Routine culturing of P19 cells and the isolation of P19 cells overexpressing MEF2C, MyoD, or myogenin, termed P19[MEF2C], P19[MyoD], or P19[Mgn] cells, respectively, have been described previously (36Skerjanc I.S.

Each of the three high expressing P19[MEF2C] cell lines behaved similarly, and all experiments reported were performed at least twice with at least two of these cell lines with similar results. Differentiation was initiated by plating 5 × 105cells into 60-mm bacterial dishes in the presence of 0.8% Me2SO. Cells were cultured as aggregates for 4 days, plated in tissue culture dishes, and harvested for RNA or fixed for immunofluorescence at the time indicated. The fetal calf serum used in the experiments presented in this manuscript did not support the differentiation of P19 cells into skeletal muscle (38Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. In Vitro Cellular and Developmental Biology-Animal. 1999; 35: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). P19 and P19[MEF2C] cells were plated on day 4 of differentiation onto gelatin-coated coverslips. For identifying myosin heavy chain (42Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C and reacted with antibody as described (40Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For identifying myogenin, 50 μl of the monoclonal antibody F5D supernatant (43Wright W.E. Dackorytko I.A. Farmer K. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with cells that had been fixed for 1 h at room temperature with Lana's fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 14% v/v saturated picric acid, 125 mmsodium phosphate). After three 5-min washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated for 30 min in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 1 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) Cy3-linked antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Immunofluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope; images were captured with a Sony 3CCD color video camera, processed using Northern Exposure, Adobe Photoshop, and Corel Draw software, and printed with a dye sublimation phaser 450 Tektronic printer. Total RNA was isolated by the lithium chloride/urea extraction method, and 6 μg were examined by Northern blot analysis as described previously (40Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The probes used were: a 600-base pair PstI fragment from the human cardiac α-actin last exon (44Rudnicki M.A. Jackowski G. Saggin L. McBurney M.W. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a 1.8-kb EcoRI fragment from the mouse MyoD cDNA (6Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B.

Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Northern blots were visualized with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SI and quantitated with ImageQuant software. Averages and standard errors (S.E.) were calculated and reported. RT-PCR was performed as described previously (36Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A titration of the first strand reaction was performed to ensure that the PCR reaction was analyzed in the linear range. Southern blot analysis was performed on RT-PCR products with a probe from the corresponding cDNA. Negative controls included performing RT-PCR experiments in the absence of RNA, of first strand, and of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase. The following pairs of primers were used: 5′-tccatccacgtcggccaggct-3′ and 5′-gtagggctcaaccacagcagt-3′ for tubulin with an annealing temperature of 61 °C and 5′-gactccccactccccattcacata-3′ and 5′-ggcggcagctttacaaacaacaca-3′ for myogenin (10Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K. Cell. 1989; 56: 607-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), with an annealing temperature of 55 °C. Myosin was harvested by the method of Burridge and Bray (49Burridge K. Bray D. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) from cultures at various time points as indicated. The second dialysis step was omitted. Total protein concentration of the myosin extract was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Samples (5 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with one of the following mouse monoclonal antibody supernatants: anti-MHC antibody, MF20 (reacts with all forms), at a 1:6000 dilution (42Bader D.

Anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as a secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution, and the reaction was visualized using the ECL Western blotting reagent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. Several studies have shown differences in the abilities of each of the MRFs to transactivate promoters and to activate endogenous genes. However, the functional significance of these results has not been clearly defined (52Asakura A. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Komiya T. Nabeshima Y. Nabeshima Y. Mol. Cell.

Bergstrom D.A. Tapscott S.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To determine which MEF2 family members are involved in the regulatory loop with the MRFs, P19[MyoD] (40Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and P19[Mgn] cell lines were differentiated and examined for their ability to activate the expression of MEF2 family members. Northern blots were prepared using RNA from P19[MyoD] and P19[Mgn] cell lines on day 6 of differentiation in the presence of Me2SO. As shown previously (40Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar),2 both MyoD and myogenin required cellular aggregation to initiate myogenesis. MyoD and myogenin did not cross-activate each other's expression to high levels when compared with their exogenous expression levels (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, P19[MyoD] and P19[Mgn] cells express predominantly one MRF or the other and can be used to study differences in target gene specificity for MyoD and myogenin. MEF2C expression levels (Fig. 1 C) paralleled the levels of myogenin (Fig. 1 A) and not MyoD (Fig. 1 B) expression in these cell lines. The expression levels of MyoD, myogenin, and MEF2C were quantitated by densitometry in five additional P19[MyoD] and nine additional P19[Mgn] cell lines. Linear regression analysis confirmed that the MEF2C expression correlated with myogenin expression (p< 0.0001) and not MyoD. MEF2A, -B, and -D transcripts were expressed at very low levels and were not up-regulated by myogenin or MyoD expression (data not shown). In summary, myogenin, but not MyoD expression, resulted in the activation of MEF2C and not MEF2A, -B, or -D expression. Because P19[MyoD] and P19[Mgn] skeletal myocytes expressed different levels of MyoD, myogenin, and MEF2C, an examination of the differences in muscle-specific structural gene expression was initiated by analysis of the pattern of MHC isoforms/genes expressed. Western blots performed on myosin harvested on days 8, 10, 14, and 17 showed that the same MHC isoforms were present at similar levels in both P19[MyoD] and P19[Mgn] cultures (Fig. 2), including embryonic fast, neonatal fast, neonatal slow, and adult fast IIB and IIX. Although a doublet of MHC neonatal slow (Fig. 2 D) seems to appear in P19[MyoD] cells, this was not a consistent, reproducible finding. Therefore, whereas MyoD and myogenin differentially activate the expression of MEF2C, they activate similar levels of MHC isoform expression. Because MEF2C expression was specifically up-regulated by myogenin, P19[MEF2C] cells (36Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were examined in terms of their ability to undergo skeletal myogenesis and activate the expression of the MRFs. Previous work has shown that P19[MEF2C] cells differentiate into cardiac muscle when aggregated in the absence of Me2SO (36Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this set of experiments, P19[MEF2C] cells were aggregated in the presence of Me2SO under conditions in which control cells do not undergo myogenesis. P19 and P19[MEF2C] cells were aggregated for 4 days with Me2SO and examined on day 9 by phase contrast microscopy and immunofluorescence with antibodies directed against myogenin and myosin heavy chain (Fig. 3). Bipolar skeletal myocytes were visible by phase contrast microscopy on day 9 in P19[MEF2C] cultures (Fig. 3 D) but not in control cultures (Fig. 3 A). In agreement with the cellular morphology, P19[MEF2C] cultures contained cells that expressed myogenin protein in the nuclei of the bipolar skeletal myocytes (Fig. 3 E). In contrast, P19 control cells did not differentiate into skeletal muscle under the serum conditions used for these experiments, shown by the lack of cells expressing myogenin (Fig. 3 B). These results were confirmed by staining for the presence of myosin heavy chain by immunoreaction with MF20 (42Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). MF20 reacts with myosin heavy chain present in both cardiac and skeletal muscle, and these two cell types can be distinguished by their morphology (37Skerjanc I.S. McBurney M.W. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As expected, P19[MEF2C] cultures contained bipolar skeletal myocytes (Fig. 3 F), whereas P19 control-transfected cells contained only cardiac myocytes (Fig. 3 C). The bipolar skeletal myocytes present in P19[MEF2C] cultures are morphologically similar to those previously observed in P19 and P19[MyoD] cells (40Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The presence of MEF2C did not affect the endogenous differentiation of P19[MEF2C] cells into cardiac muscle, and therefore P19[MEF2C] cultures treated with Me2SO contained both cardiac and skeletal muscle on day 9 (data not shown). The conditions required and the extent of differentiation into skeletal muscle were quantitated by counting myogenin and MF20-positive cells under each culture condition. The development of substantial numbers of skeletal myocytes (5–6% of total cells) required MEF2C expression and nine days of differentiation after aggregation with Me2SO (Fig. 4). The number of MF20 positive cells is slightly lower than the number of myogenin-positive cells. The number of myocytes that reacted with MF20 may be an underestimate because only bipolar myocytes were counted. Alternatively, the number could be lower because of a slightly earlier expression of myogenin compared with myosin heavy chain. Northern blot analysis was used to examine the expression of muscle-specific genes. Total RNA from P19 and P19[MEF2C] cultures was harvested on day 6 and day 9 after aggregation with Me2SO. Transfected MEF2C transcripts were expressed in P19[MEF2C] cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–6) but not in P19 control cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1–3). Interestingly, the expression of exogenous MEF2C transcripts seemed to result in the up-regulation of endogenous MEF2C expression. The expression levels of MEF2A, MEF2B, and MEF2D were very low and did not appear to change in any of the conditions examined (data not shown). The formation of MEF2C-induced skeletal muscle was demonstrated by the expression of myogenin on day 9 in P19[MEF2C] cells but not in P19 control cells (Fig. 5C, lane 6 compared with 3). Low levels of MyoD were barely detectable in MEF2C-induced muscle (data not shown). Myf-5 and MRF4 expression were not detected under these conditions (data not shown). Aggregation activated cardiac α-actin expression by day 6 in both P19[MEF2C] and P19 cells, indicating the formation of cardiac muscle in both populations (Fig. 5 B,lanes 2 and 5). The level of cardiac α-actin expression appears lower in P19[MEF2C] cultures compared with P19 cultures on day 6 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 and5), however this result was variable. Thus, in agreement with the immunofluorescent staining, the Northern blot analysis results support the observation that MEF2C initiates skeletal muscle development. Because MEF2C is known to act synergistically with the MRFs, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine MRF expression levels under each condition. Substantial expression of myogenin was observed only in day 9 P19[MEF2C] cultures treated with Me2SO (Fig. 6 A), with an average of 130 ± 30-fold over background levels (n = 4). Similarly, increased levels of MyoD were observed only in day 9 P19[MEF2C] cultures treated with Me2SO (Fig. 6 B) with an average of 5 ± 1-fold over background levels (n = 4). Therefore, myogenin expression was activated an average of 26-fold more efficiently than MyoD expression. The low levels of MyoD expression detected in P19 and P19[MEF2C] cultures (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1–5) were not present in the negative control RT-PCR reactions performed (data not shown). No evidence of increased levels of MyoD or myogenin was found in P19 control cells treated with Me2SO (Fig. 6, A andB, compare lanes 1, 3, and5). Therefore, these results show that MEF2C up-regulates the expression of myogenin considerably more efficiently than that of MyoD. Although, the presence of a regulatory loop between the MRFs and MEF2 families has been shown previously (14Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4854-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 15Yee S.P. Rigby P.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 16Cheng T.C. Wallace M.C. Merlie J.P. Olson E.N. Science. 1993; 261: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the MEF2 family member involved in this regulation was not identified. Our results show that, whereas both MyoD and myogenin induced skeletal myogenesis in aggregated P19 cells, myogenin, and not MyoD, up-regulated the expression of MEF2C during differentiation. Because MEF2A, -B, and -D expression levels remained unchanged, the ability of MEF2C to trigger skeletal muscle was examined. MEF2C initiated skeletal myogenesis in P19 cells aggregated with Me2SO. During this process, myogenin expression was up-regulated to a far greater extent than MyoD. Taken together, our results support the presence of a positive regulatory loop between the MEF2 family and the MRFs and indicate that MEF2C and myogenin, but not MyoD or MEF2A, -B, or -D, participate in this loop in differentiating stem cells. In the murine embryo, MEF2C is expressed shortly after myogenin on day 8.5 (27Edmondson D.G. Lyons G.E. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Development. 1994; 120: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that myogenin and MEF2C up-regulate each other's expression in P19 cells is consistent with the timing of their expression during embryogenesis. The presence of a positive regulatory loop could enhance the expression of both myogenin and MEF2C in the somites. Similar to MyoD and myogenin, cellular aggregation was required for the full activity of MEF2C. It is likely that proteins expressed as a result of cellular aggregation regulate MEF2C activity. The lack of up-regulation of MRF expression during the cellular aggregation of control cells suggests that MEF2C may not be simply acting synergistically to amplify low levels of these tissue-restricted transcription factors. Our results agree with the finding that ectopic expression of MEF2 in Drosophila epidermis activates the expression of skeletal muscle genes (30Lin M.H. Bour B.A. Abmayr S.M. Storti R.V. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This activation was found to be stage-dependent, suggesting that a factor is expressed in Drosophila epidermis that can regulate MEF2C function. Factors that regulate MEF2C may be other transcription factors, kinases, or phosphatases. MEF2C can be regulated by phosphorylation events because of interactions with casein kinase-II (61Molkentin J.D. Li L. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17199-17204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (62Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4771-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These factors are candidates for regulating MEF2C-induced skeletal myogenesis. The difference between the results reported here in P19 cells and the contradictory results from studies in fibroblasts is probably because of the expression of the appropriate regulatory molecules in aggregated P19 cells, which may or may not be expressed in fibroblasts. Because P19[MRF] cells produce abundant skeletal muscle (>30%) and P19[MEF2C] cells produce only moderate amounts of skeletal muscle (<10%), our results suggest that MyoD is regulated by factors expressed in a larger proportion of the total cell population than factors regulating MEF2C. These results agree with the finding that MyoD can readily initiate myogenesis in fibroblasts. The use of serum that does not support Me2SO-induced skeletal myogenesis in P19 cells may contribute to the ability of MEF2C to function in P19 cells. The exact mechanism by which factors in serum regulate P19 cell myogenesis is unknown (38Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. In Vitro Cellular and Developmental Biology-Animal. 1999; 35: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because MEF2C is known to bind MEF2 sites and activate skeletal muscle-specific promoters, it is likely that MEF2C is functioning in a similar manner in P19 cells. However, MEF2C expression may be promoting myogenesis by activating the expression of other factors involved in myogenesis or cooperating with existing factors. Alternatively, it is possible that the overexpression of MEF2C may lead to myogenesis by sequestering negative regulatory elements. The phenotypes of MRF knockout mice clearly indicate that MRFs have distinct biological roles in controlling skeletal muscle development. However, the mechanisms that define these differences are still poorly understood. In fibroblasts, MyoD and myogenin tend to cross-activate each other's expression, making it difficult to determine their specific functions (59Olson E.N. Klein W.H.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In the latter experiment, it was shown in fibroblasts that MyoD was 10-fold more efficient than myogenin in activating genes located in regions of transcriptionally silent chromatin. Our results in P19 cells indicate that myogenin was more proficient in activating endogenous MEF2C gene expression than MyoD. The role of chromatin modeling during myogenesis in P19 cells remains to be determined. Our finding that MHC isoforms were not differentially regulated agrees with previous results, which show no correlation between the expression of MRFs and adult muscle transcripts, like MHC, in mouse muscle cell lines (67Aurade F. Pinset C. Chafey P. Gros F. Montarras D. Differentiation. 1994; 55: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 70Yutzey K.E. Rhodes S.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell.

In contrast to the results obtained in tissue culture, myogenin is expressed at high levels in slow muscle fibers, and MyoD is selectively accumulated in adult rat fast muscle fibers (72Hughes S.M. Taylor J.M. Tapscott S.J. Gurley C.M. Carter W.J. Peterson C.A. Development. 1993; 118: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because MRFs act via E-box elements, further experiments are required to determine the mechanism by which some E-boxes are differentially regulated by MyoD and myogenin, whereas other E-boxes are not. It seems likely that the N- and C-terminal regions of the MRFs are involved, as shown previously for the differential activation of exogenous promoters (41Mak K.L. To R.Q. Kong Y. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4334-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 52Asakura A. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Komiya T. Nabeshima Y. Nabeshima Y. Mol. Cell.

These domains could interact with other factors that may be involved in determining specificity. In summary, examining the ability of transcription factors to modulate the developmental potential of P19 cells provides a powerful tool for subsequent analysis of the mechanisms involved. Using this system, we have shown that MEF2C and myogenin induce myogenesis and participate in a positive regulatory loop in P19 cells.

The liganded VDR in association with its partner retinoid X receptor (RXR) (a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily) binds to specific control elements referred to as vitamin D response elements (VDREs) that are located in the promoter of target genes (8Carlberg C.

Current evidence suggests the VDR·RXR heterodimeric complex binds to the VDRE in the unliganded state (3Hewison M. O'Riordan J.L.H. Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike J.W. Vitamin D.

Transactivation of the target gene is achieved through an intermediary coactivator complex that functions to link the VDR·RXR receptor complex to the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (10Xu L. Glass C.K.

The level of expression of 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive genes in tissues is dependent on the presence of VDR and the concentration of intracellular 1,25-(OH)2D3. Steady-state levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in cells and the circulation are determined by a balance between 1,25-(OH)2D3bioactivation and degradation (1Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in the bioactivation pathway is catalyzed by 25-hydroxyvitamin D31-hydroxylase (13St.-Arnaud R. Messerlian S. Moir J.M. Omdahl J.L. Glorieux F.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1552-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 14Takeyama K.-I. Kitanaka S. Takashi S. Kobori M. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Science. 1997; 277: 1827-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and the kidney is the major site of synthesis of biologically active 1,25-(OH)2D3. Metabolic inactivation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and conversion to water-soluble products are catalyzed by the C24 oxidation pathway (15Reddy G.S. Tserng K.-Y. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1763-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The initial step in this pathway involves the mitochondrial cytochrome P450C24 enzyme (i.e. 25-hydroxyvitamin D324-hydroxylase, CYP24) (16Omdahl J.L. May B.K. Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 69-85Google Scholar). In the normal situation, CYP24 is expressed mainly in the kidney but can be substantially induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in this and many other tissues. The up-regulation of CYP24 in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 constitutes an important negative feedback mechanism, whereby the hormone acts to regulate its ambient and cellular concentration. Hence, expression of CYP24 in kidney and other tissues serves a protective function in guarding against excessive levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3 that can be deleterious due to the attendant hypercalcemia. In addition, specific biological actions in bone have been reported for 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(24,25-(OH)2D3) (17Boyan B.D. Dean D.D. Sylvia V.L. Schwartz Z. Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 259-273Google Scholar), a metabolite whose cellular concentration is directed by regulation of CYP24gene expression. It is clear, therefore, that regulation ofCYP24 gene expression is important in the metabolism and function of metabolites from the vitamin D pathway. Studies into the molecular mechanism by which 1,25-(OH)2D3 induces the CYP24 gene are in progress (18Kerry D.M. Dwivedi P.P. Hahn C.N. Morris H.M. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the rat promoter, there are two functional VDREs located at −136/−150 and −244/−258 on the antisense strand (18Kerry D.M. Dwivedi P.P. Hahn C.N. Morris H.M. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29715-29721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To date, this dual arrangement of VDREs is unique among the 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive genes. The two VDREs conform to the classic sequence, each consisting of two direct repeats separated by a 3-bp spacer. Gel mobility shift analysis using antibodies has established that both VDREs bind heterodimeric complexes of VDR·RXR (18Kerry D.M. Dwivedi P.P. Hahn C.N. Morris H.M. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29715-29721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Transcriptional synergy between the two VDREs has been demonstrated and is particularly evident at high levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (18Kerry D.M. Dwivedi P.P. Hahn C.N. Morris H.M. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29715-29721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Indeed, the CYP24promoter appears to be the most responsive promoter to 1,25-(OH)2D3 so far identified with levels of induction of 20–70-fold being observed in transient assays (21Hahn C.N. Kerry D.M. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In our previous studies on the rat CYP24 promoter, we unexpectedly observed that the proximal VDRE had greater transactivation ability than the distal VDRE, yet its affinity for the VDR·RXR complex in gel mobility shift assays was markedly lower (18Kerry D.M. Dwivedi P.P. Hahn C.N. Morris H.M. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29715-29721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This finding raised the possibility of transcriptional cooperation between the VDR·RXR complex and nearby transcription factors (22Liu M. Freedman L.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we used computer analysis to identify both an Ets-binding site and a possible AP-1 site juxtaposed and downstream to the proximal VDRE. A possible gene regulatory role for an Ets-binding site has not been documented for the CYP24 gene, whereas a functional Jun/Fos AP-1 site would be consistent with the observed action of TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) to up-regulate CYP24 enzyme activity (23Koyama H. Inaba M. Nishizawa Y. Ohno S. Morii H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consequently, these two sites were evaluated for possible roles in facilitating the proximal VDRE functionality in mediating the action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to induce expression of the CYP24 gene. 1,25-(OH)2D3 was supplied by Hoffmann-La Roche. A Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Bresatec (Adelaide, South Australia). The luciferase assay kit was from Promega (Madison, WI). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatographic support and glutathione-agarose were from Qiagen GmbH (Germany). Two oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction primers engineered withKpnI sites were employed to amplify −186 bp of theCYP24 promoter sequence (encompassing the proximal VDRE at −150/−136) together with 74 bp of 5′-untranslated region using the pCYP24WT(−298)-Luc plasmid (18Kerry D.M.

The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned at the KpnI site in pGL3-Basic vector containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene as described previously (24Dwivedi P.P. Muscat G.E.O. Bailey P.J. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutations in promoter-luciferase constructs (see Fig. 1 B) in VDRE half-sites, EBS, and AP-1-like sites were introduced using the Quik-Change mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutated constructs were sequenced to verify the desired mutations. pRSV-hVDR was generated by cloning human VDR cDNA sequence downstream of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (21Hahn C.N. Kerry D.M. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The expression clones for human Ets-1, p42Ets-1, and Ets-2 are based on the pEFBOS vector and have been described previously (25Thomas R.S. Tymms M.J. Seth A. Shannon M.F. Kola I. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2135-2143PubMed Google Scholar). Human Fli-1 and PU-1 expression clones were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Hromas, Department of Medicine, Indiana University. An activated Ras (Ha-c-Ras) expression clone (pHO6T1), and expression clones for chicken p54-Ets-1 wild-type (c-Ets-1 Thr-38) and mutated cEts-1 (c-Ets-1 T38A) were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Ostrowski (Ohio State University) (26Yang B.S.

Monkey kidney fibroblast COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). In preparation for electroporation, cells were grown in a 175-cm2 flask to 60–70% confluency, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and removed by trypsinization. Transfections were performed by electroporation of cells (2 × 106) in 500 μl of ice-cold electroporation buffer as described previously (24Dwivedi P.P. Muscat G.E.O. Bailey P.J. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), containing 250 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and 2 pmol of promoter luciferase construct. The electroporation of COS-1 cells (280 V and 960 microfarads) was performed using a Bio-Rad gene pulser. A reference plasmid, pRSV-βGal, was also included in the transfections to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. Following electroporation, the samples were placed on ice for 10 min and divided into two wells of a 6-well plate containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% FCS. Cells were allowed to recover overnight, and medium was replaced with RPMI and 10% charcoal-stripped FCS. Cells were further treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10−7m) or ethanol carrier and incubated for 24 h prior to harvesting. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined as described previously (18Kerry D.M. Dwivedi P.P. Hahn C.N. Morris H.M. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29715-29721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All cells used in transactivation studies were cotransfected with the VDR-expression vector pRSV-hVDR to compensate for a low endogenous VDR level in COS-1 cells (19Ohyama Y. Ozono K. Uchida M.

Double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized to contain the EBS and AP-1-like sites (CYP24-EBS), a mutated core sequence of EBS (CYP24-mEBS), a mutated AP-1-like sequence (CYP24-mAP1), the proximal VDRE alone (CYP24-VDRE), or together with EBS as a composite oligonucleotide (VDRE + EBS). An oligonucleotide that encompassed a known Ets-1-binding site from T-cell receptor gene enhancer (TCRαEts-1) was employed as a control (27Ho I.C. Bhat N.K. Gottschalk L.R. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B.

Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Each double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled by end-filling with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme and purified by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Binding reactions for each assay contained 5 μg of nuclear protein, 1 μl of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 12 μl in Dignum buffer C (20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, 420 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and were incubated on ice for 15 min. Radiolabeled probe (200,000 cpm) was added, and samples were incubated on ice for another 30 min. For gel-shift inhibition assays, a polyclonal antibody to Ets protein DNA binding domain (PAN-Ets) was employed, and a VDR monoclonal antibody designated IgG2b (Affinity BioReagents Inc., Neshanic Station, NJ) was used as a control. For supershift assays, a polyclonal antibody to Ets-1 (29Ghysdael J. Gegonne A. Pognonec P. Dernis D. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1714-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and a polyclonal antibody to Erg-1/Erg-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were employed. These antibodies were included in the binding reaction and incubated on ice for 15–30 min prior to addition of probe. Gel-shift competition assays were performed with unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide at molar excess concentrations (50–100-fold) by inclusion in the binding reactions. Retarded DNA nuclear protein complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel using precooled low ionic strength gel running buffer (0.5× TBE) at 4 °C. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. Recombinant full-length human Ets-1 (p54Ets-1) was produced in Escherichia coli as a carboxyl histidine-tagged fusion protein and purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The tagged Ets-1 protein migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of about 55 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Recombinant VDR and RXR were produced in E. coli as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. A clone pGEX-2T RXR, from Dr. George Muscat, University of Queensland, Australia, expressed GST-RXR, and a clone (pGEX-2T VDR) was created in our laboratory with human VDR cDNA cloned into pGEX2T in frame with GST sequence. The GST-VDR and GST-RXR fusion proteins were purified by affinity binding to glutathione-agarose beads. DNA binding reactions contained recombinant Ets-1, GST-VDR, or GST-RXR with 50 ng of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 10 μl in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Radiolabeled probes (10,000 cpm) were added and samples further incubated at room temperature for 20 min. For supershift assays and competition binding assays, antibodies for Ets-1 and unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides, respectively, were included prior to addition of probe. Retarded complexes were resolved by 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Association constants (K a) for the binding of recombinant Ets-1 to CYP24-EBS and CYP24-mAP1 were determined by gel-shift assays. Increasing amounts of purified Ets-1 (0.125, 0.250, 0.500, and 1–4 μg) were incubated in a binding reaction with 1 ng of radiolabeled probe. The DNA protein complexes were resolved by 5% nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, dried, and exposed in the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Ets-1-bound DNA complexes and unbound-probe were quantified using ImageQuant Software. The association constants, defined as the Ets-1 concentration at which 50% of the DNA probe was retarded, were determined by direct curve fitting (Sigma Plot, Jandel Scientific). Previous expression studies (18Kerry D.M. Dwivedi P.P. Hahn C.N. Morris H.M. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29715-29721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) of the ratCYP24 promoter suggested that 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated transactivation at the proximal VDRE (−136/−150) required the participation of a nearby transcription factor(s). An examination of sequences downstream from this VDRE revealed a likely binding site for Ets transcription factors (5′-AGAGGATGGA-3′) at −119/−128 on the antisense strand (Fig. 1 A). Members of the Ets transcription factor family bind to a common core motif (5′-GGA(A/T)-3′) with flanking sequence determining the specificity of binding. The site identified here with a 5′-GGAT-3′ core, strongly resembles known binding sites for Ets-1 (30Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Also noted was a possible AP-1-like sequence (5′-TGACTCC-3′) at −132/−126, which differs from the consensus AP-1 site (5′-TGACTCA-3′) by one nucleotide and overlaps the Ets-binding site (EBS). To evaluate whether the EBS contributes to 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependentCYP24 promoter expression, the core EBS motif was mutated (5′-GGAT-3′ to 5′-TTTT-3′) in a luciferase-reporter construct that contained −298 bp of promoter sequence and both VDREs of theCYP24 promoter. The wild-type and mutated-EBS promoter constructs are designated pCYP24WT(−298)-Luc and pCYP24mEBS(−298)-Luc, respectively (Fig. 1, B andC). In response to 1,25-(OH)2D3, the wild-type construct gave a 27.2-fold level of induction, but this was reduced to 14.2-fold when the EBS was inactivated (Fig. 2). The importance of the EBS in sustaining the 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated transactivation of the CYP24 promoter constructs was explored further by cotransfection studies with an Ets-1 expression vector. Cells containing the pCYP24WT(−298)-Luc displayed more than a doubling of activity (58.2-fold) when cotransfected with Ets-1 (Fig. 2). The mutant EBS construct in the presence of Ets-1 gave the same activity (14.5-fold) as observed for this mutated construct in the absence of Ets-1 (Fig. 2). It was evident from these studies, therefore, that the EBS was critical for maximal up-regulation of theCYP24 promoter. Due to the location of the EBS in the region downstream of the proximal VDRE, subsequent studies were conducted using constructs that contained only the proximal promoter element and adjacent EBS and AP-1-like sequences. The single VDRE construct (−186 bp of promoter sequence; pCYP24WT-Luc) expressed a 7.6-fold level of induction (Fig. 2), which is about 28% of the value obtained with the construct containing both functional VDREs (i.e. pCYP24WT(−298)-Luc). This activity for the proximal VDRE is about 2-fold higher than the contribution made by the more distal VDRE (data not shown), which reflects the cooperative synergism between the two VDREs in the rat CYP24 promoter (18Kerry D.M. Dwivedi P.P. Hahn C.N. Morris H.M. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29715-29721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mutation of the EBS in the proximal VDRE construct (i.e. pCYP24mEBS-Luc) resulted in a substantial loss in transactivation activity (7.6- to 4.2-fold) that was qualitatively similar to results obtained using the native two-VDRE construct (i.e. pCYPWT(−298)-Luc) (Fig. 2). Transfected Ets-1 plasmid was ineffective in stimulating transactivation of the mutated EBS construct (i.e. pCYP24mEBS-Luc, 4.3-fold induction), whereas induction was increased from 7.6- to 14.0-fold in cells containing the wild-type construct with an intact EBS (i.e. pCYP24WT-Luc) (Fig. 2). In the absence of added 1,25-(OH)2D3, the basal level of expression of the wild-type construct was not affected by either EBS inactivation or overexpression of Ets-1 (data not shown). Mutagenesis of the VDRE alone (pCYP24mVDRE-Luc, Fig. 1 B) lowered induction of the wild-type construct to 1.2-fold (Fig. 2) confirming that this is the only functional VDRE present in the −186 bp of promoter sequence as reported previously (24Dwivedi P.P. Muscat G.E.O. Bailey P.J. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Ets-1 was also investigated on the construct pCYP24mVDRE-Luc. In this situation, there was no effect on expression in the presence of hormone (Fig. 2) confirming that Ets-1 cannot transactivate in the absence of a functional VDRE. The data in Fig. 2 provide evidence for transcriptional synergy between the EBS and VDRE. For example, the 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of the wild-type promoter construct pCYP24WT-Luc in the presence of Ets-1 was 14.0-fold, which is greater than the sum of the individual contributions from VDRE (4.2-fold) and EBS (1.2-fold). When the constructs pCYP24WT-Luc and pCYP24mEBS-Luc were tested at a lower 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentration (i.e.10−10m), a decrease in induction occurred for the wild-type construct (from 7.6 ± 1.1- to 2.8 ± 0.3-fold), and no induction was observed for the mEBS construct. For comparison, the induction of the −298 construct (pCYP24WT(−298)-Luc) was also examined. At this low concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3, induction was lowered from 27.2 ± 1.8- to 3.7 ± 0.5-fold, and mutagenesis of the EBS led to the loss of induction (1.5 ± 0.25-fold). It is clear, therefore, that the EBS is critical for the function of the proximal VDRE, especially when hormone is near physiological concentration. The role of EBS in stimulating CYP24 promoter activity was evaluated in the transactivation assay using various Ets proteins. Ets family members can be classified according to their homology to Ets-1 (31Westermarck J. Seth A. Kahari V.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2651-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Class I members such as Ets-1 and Ets-2 have extensive overall sequence similarity (30Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Erg-1 and Fli-1, class II members, show homology to Ets-1 both in their N-terminal transactivation and C-terminal DNA binding domains, whereas class III members such as PU.1 show homology only in the DNA binding domain (30Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). We investigated the ability of a representative member from each of the three classes (human Ets-1, Fli-1, and PU.1) to transactivate the wild-type CYP24promoter in COS-1 cells. Neither Fli-1 nor PU.1 further increased the 7.6-fold level of 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction observed with the pCYP24WT-Luc construct (Fig. 3). By contrast, Ets-1 elevated 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction of the wild-type construct to 14.0-fold (Fig. 3). The inability of Fli-1 or PU.1 to bind the EBS was not investigated. The transactivation activity of p42Ets-1, an alternatively spliced form of Ets-1 (32Koizumi S. Fisher R.J. Fujiwara S. Jorcyk C. Bhat N.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 675-681PubMed Google Scholar), and Ets-2, both class I members of the Ets family, were also evaluated in overexpression studies. The activity of p42Ets-1 was comparable to Ets-1, where it stimulated the wild-type level of induction from 7.6- to 15.6-fold, whereas Ets-2 was less active (7.6- to 10.8-fold) (Fig. 3). It was further shown that the observed transactivation activities of p42Ets-1 and Ets-2 were completely abrogated when the EBS site in the promoter was mutated. Similar to Ets-1, neither p42Ets-1 nor Ets-2 altered basal expression of the wild-type construct or expression of the mutant VDRE construct (pCYP24mVDRE-Luc) in the presence or absence of hormone (data not shown). To investigate nuclear protein binding to the EBS, gel mobility shift analysis was carried out using COS-1 cell nuclear extracts and the oligonucleotide probe CYP24-EBS. Six nuclear-protein complexes (C1–C6) were consistently detected together with an inconsistently appearing band(s) between C3 and C4 (Fig. 4 A). A similar profile of protein binding was observed with a control Ets-1 probe (TCRαEts-1) from the T-cell receptor α-gene enhancer (27Ho I.C. Bhat N.K. Gottschalk L.R. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B.

Expression of SP-B by respiratory epithelial cells is regulated by developmental and hormonal influences at the level of gene transcription. Previous studies supported the role of retinoic acids (RA) and their receptors (RARs) inSP-B gene transcription. In the present study, RARα was detected in mouse alveolar type II epithelial cells where SP-B is synthesized and processed. Deletion and site-specific mutagenesis analysis identified clustered retinoic acid-responsive element sites in the 5′-flanking enhancer region of the hSP-B gene that bound RARα proteins. RAR coactivators ACTR, SRC-1, and transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2) stimulated human (h) SP-B promoter activity in a dose-dependent fashion in pulmonary adenocarcinoma H441 cells. In addition, an RAR-associated protein, CREB-binding protein (CBP), potentiated the effects of RAR on hSP-B promoter activity in H441 cells. Importantly, RA stimulation of the hSP-B promoter depends on tissue-specific thyroid transcription factor (TTF-1) DNA-binding sites. TTF-1 protein synergistically stimulated the hSP-B promoter with RARα, CBP, and nuclear receptor coactivators in H441 cells. In addition, TTF-1 interacted directly with RARα and TIF2 in the mammalian two-hybrid system.

Deficiency or disruption of pulmonary surfactant causes respiratory distress syndrome. Surfactant consists not only of phospholipid, but it also contains several surfactant proteins including SP-A,1 -B, -C, and -D that contribute to surfactant function and/or homeostasis. Surfactant proteins facilitate the spreading and enhance the stability of phospholipids in the alveoli and play an important role in host defense. SP-B is a 79-amino acid peptide that is derived by proteolytic processing of pro-SP-B in type II epithelial cells in the lung. SP-B plays a critical role in lamellar body and tubular myelin organization (1Poulain F.R. Allen L. Wlliams M.C. Hamilton R.L. Hawgood S. Am. J.

Immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization studies indicate that SP-B mRNA and protein are restricted to type II cells and nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells in the lung (9Glasser S.W.

The specificity ofSP-B gene expression in pulmonary epithelial cells is primarily modulated at the level of gene transcription. Activities of multiple transcription factors on the SP-B promoter region contribute to the precise temporal-spatial distribution of SP-B gene expression in the lung. An enhancer region has been identified in the 5′-flanking region of the hSP-B gene (12Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Deletion of the enhancer dramatically reduced the hSP-B transcription activity in H441 cells. Three clustered DNA-binding sites of homeodomain-containing thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) have been identified in the enhancer region. Site-specific mutagenesis of the TTF-1 sites abolished enhancer activity completely (12Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). TTF-1 is expressed in the lung, thyroid, and forebrain (13Lazzaro D. Price M. Felice M.D. Lauro R.D. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TTF-1 was originally identified in the thyroid where it controls the transcription of thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin genes (14Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Lauro R.D. EMBO J. 1993; 8: 2537-2542Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 15Mizuno K. Gonzalez F.J. Kimura S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4927-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the lung, TTF-1 mRNA and protein were detected at the earliest stages of differentiation and were restricted to bronchial and alveolar epithelium in the postnatal lung (13Lazzaro D. Price M. Felice M.D. Lauro R.D. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hSP-B gene is also regulated by retinoic acids (RA) and their receptors (RAR). RA increased SP-B mRNA and pro-SP-B protein in H441 cells (16Yan C. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Zeng X. Sever Z. Lin S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L239-L246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17George T.N.

The responsiveness of RA stimulatory effect was identified within the enhancer region of the hSP-B promoter (16Yan C. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Zeng X. Sever Z. Lin S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L239-L246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a dominant negative RARα403 mutant inhibited the hSP-B promoter in H441 cells, indicating an essential role of RAR in hSP-B promoter activity in respiratory epithelial cells (21Ghaffari M Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L398-L404PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the RA/RAR axis pathway in lung development is highlighted by the RARα/β double knock-out mouse which exhibited hypoplastic lungs (22Mendelsohn C. Lohnes D. Decimo D. Lufkin T. LeMeur M. Chambon P. Development. 1994; 120: 2749-2771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, RA altered branching morphogenesis of the lung in vitro (19Bogue C.W. Jacobs H.C. Dynia D.W.

Whereas the mechanisms by which RA affects lung development have not been fully clarified, expression of all three forms of RAR mRNAs was observed in the lung (28Dolle P. Ruberte E. Leroy P.

Physiol. 1998; 275: L239-L246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that RA and RAR play important roles in differentiation, growth, and homeostasis of epithelial cells in various tissues (30Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 31Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P.

RAR belongs to a large steroid/nonsteroid nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that consists of three receptor isotypes α, β, γ, each encoded by distinct genes. RAR forms a heterodimer with (RXR) to bind to the retinoic acid-responsive element (RARE) on the target genes. Whereas RAR has weak DNA binding activity, RXR greatly enhanced RAR DNA binding activity through dimerization of RAR/RXR (33Yang N. Schule R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). RAR consists of a DNA-binding domain that contains Zn2+ finger motifs, a ligand-binding/dimerization domain, a ligand-independent AF-1 transcription activation domain, and a ligand-dependent AF-2 transcription activation domain. Through these various functional domains, RAR interacts with other transcription factors, including CBP/p300 and nuclear receptor coactivators. The first nuclear receptor coactivator identified was SRC-1 (34Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). Several other coactivators were subsequently identified, including ACTR, TIF2, p/CIP, and p300/CBP-associated factor (35Chen H.W. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L.

The interactions between RAR and coactivators are mediated by a well conserved amphipathic α-helix in the AF-2 domain of RAR (41Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Cronemeyer H. Moras D.

In addition to nuclear receptors, coactivators with HATs interact with each other to form a large transcription activation complex. Recruitment of multiple HATs leads to chromatin remodeling and target gene activation. In the absence of hormone ligands, nuclear receptors interact with corepressors, such as SMRT/TRAC and N-CoR/RIP13 to repress gene activation (46Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 47Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurodawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). These corepressors possess histone deacetylase activity (48Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E.

Therefore, histone acetylation/deacetylation is critical to nuclear receptor signaling in epithelial cells. The hSP-B-500 construct was made previously (12Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The hSP-B 470 and hSP-B 417 constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), synthetic oligonucleotide primers, and the hSP-B 500 construct as a template. The upstream primers with the MluI site for the hSP-B constructs were as follows: hSP-B 470 5′-CGCACGCGTAGGTGGTGAGAGTGTCCTGG and hSP-B 417 5′-CGCACGCGTGCCAGGCAGGAAGCTCT. The downstream primer with the XhoI site was 5′-GCGCTCGAGCCACTGCAGCAGGTGTGACTC. The PCR products were digested with MluI and XhoI restriction enzymes (Life Technologies, Inc.) and ligated withMluI/XhoI-digested pGL2-B luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). To generate the site-specific mutants of the hSP-B-500 construct at the RARE/S1, S2, S3, and S1/S3 sites, two steps of PCR were conducted. For the first PCR, mutant PCR oligonucleotides were synthesized with mutations at the positions identical to the EMSA studies. The mutant primers were mixed with hSP-B 500 and primer GLprimer 1/GLprimer 2 (Promega) to make two sets of PCR products that were subsequently purified by low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis and the QIAquick gel extraction kit. The purified two sets of PCR products were then mixed together along with GLprimer 1 and GLprimer 2 primers for the second PCR. The second PCR products were digested with MluI/XhoI restriction enzymes. The DNA fragments with MluI- and XhoI-flanking sites at each end were purified by low melting point gel electrophoresis as described above and ligated into theMluI/XhoI-digested pGL2-B plasmid. Mutant constructs at TTF-1 sites were made previously (12Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To make SV40/hSP-B(−331 to −500), the upstream primer 5′-CGCACGCGTCAGAAGATTTTTCCAGGGGA with the MluI site and the downstream primer 5′-GCGCTCGAGGCCTGGGTGTTCCCCTCCCAT with theXhoI site were used to amplify the wild type hSP-B 500 as a template by PCR. The PCR product was purified, digested, and ligated into pGL-2 P (Promega) MluI/XhoI site. The correctness of all plasmid constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The ACTR expression vector (35Chen H.W. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells (H441) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air and passaged weekly. For hSP-B promoter deletion and mutation studies, transient transfection and luciferase reporter assays were performed as described previously (12Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 50Yan C. Tamm I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8859-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, H441 cells were seeded at densities of 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. The hSP-B reporter constructs (0.25 μg) hSP-B500, hSP-B470, hSP-B417, and mutation constructs hSP-B500/S1, hSP-B500/S2, hSP-B500/S3, and hSP-B500/S1/S3 were transfected with 0.5 μg of pCMV-βgal plasmid into H441 cells by Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 2 days of incubation with and without all-trans-RA (10−5m), cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega). The light units were assayed by luminometry (Monolight 3010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). In each transfection, β-galactosidase activities were determined for normalization of transfection efficiency. For the SV40/hSP-B(−500/−331) luciferase reporter gene studies, transient transfection and luciferase reporter assays were performed as outlined above, except the SV40 and SV40/hSP-B(−500/−331) luciferase constructs were used. To determine the stimulatory effects of RARα/RXRγ, nuclear receptor coactivators, CBP, and TTF-1, various expression constructs were cotransfected with the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter construct as specified in the figure legends and 0.5 μg of pCMV-βgal plasmid included for normalization of transfection efficiency. Carrier DNA plasmids were utilized to keep the total DNA concentrations constant for all points. The plasmid constructs of pVP16/TTF-1 AD, pM/RARα BD, and pM/TIF2 BD were made by subcloning the PCR products of TTF-1, RARα, and TIF2 molecules into pM and pV16 vectors (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA 94304) at the EcoRI/XbaI sites. The reporter construct PG5LUC was generated by subcloning of GAL4-binding sites (UASG 17-mer(×5)) and an adenovirus E1b minimal promoter into the pGL2-B luciferase reporter gene at theMluI/XhoI sites. Two hybrid cotransfections of above plasmid constructs in H441 cells were performed as recommended by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). Wild type and mutant double-stranded Oligo1 (−438 to −470) and Oligo2 (−410 to −439) of the hSP-B enhancer region were synthesized, annealed, and purified as follows: wild type Oligo1, 5′AGGTGGTGAGAGTGTCCTGGGTCTGCCCTTCCA3′; mutant Oligo1, 5′AGGTGGTGAGAGacgataGGGTCTcgattTTCCA3′; wild type Oligo2, 5′CAGGGCTTGCCCTGGGTTAAGAGCCAGGCA3′; and mutant Oligo2, 5′CAGGGCTTGgatgGGGTTAAGAGCCAGGCA3′. The underlined sequences represent the wild type or mutant RAREs. The oligonucleotides were radiolabeled by [γ-32P]ATP and kinase and incubated with 100 ng of the purified RARγ-GST fusion protein as suggested by the manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). EMSA was performed by following the procedures described previously (12Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the absence of RXR, relatively higher concentrations of RAR proteins were required due to low DNA binding affinity of RAR. Polyclonal antibody against RAR (1 μg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used in the supershift assays. Alveolar type II epithelial cells were isolated from adult mice following the procedure described previously (51Corti M. Brody A.R. Harrison J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 14: 309-315Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded onto Permanox chamber slides (Fisher) at densities ranging from 104 to 105 cells per chamber (two chambers per slide) by cytospin. For immunocytostaining of RAR proteins, the procedure followed the previous publication using RARα, -β, and -γ antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (16Yan C. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Zeng X. Sever Z. Lin S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L239-L246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SP-B mRNA and protein are present in non-ciliated bronchiolar cells and in alveolar type II epithelial cells in the lung parenchyma (52D'Amore-Bruno M.A. Wikenheiser K.A. Carter J.E. Clark J.C. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L40-L47PubMed Google Scholar). All three RARα, -β, and -γ isotypes stimulated hSP-B promoter activity and RARα and -γ expression were detected in the bronchiolar Clara cell-like H441 adenocarcinoma cell line (16Yan C. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Zeng X. Sever Z. Lin S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L239-L246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical staining of primary isolates of mouse alveolar type II cells with antibodies specifically against RARα, -β, and -γ demonstrated that only the RARα isotype was expressed in primary isolates of mouse alveolar type II epithelial cells (Fig. 1). Therefore, RARα but not RARβ plays a role in regulating hSP-B gene expression in distal respiratory epithelial cells. Since RARα was detected in both type II epithelial cells and H441 cells, its effect on the activity of the hSP-B promoter was assessedin vitro. RARα was cotransfected with equal concentrations of RXRγ and 0.25 μg of the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter construct into H441 cells. RARα/RXRγ stimulated the hSP-B 500 luciferase reporter construct in H441 cells (Fig. 2). Stimulatory effects were dose-dependent and further enhanced by all-trans-RA (10−5m), indicating that hSP-B 500 contains RAREs. Homology search revealed that the hSP-B −417 to −470 region contains three potential RARE sites (RARE/S1, RARE/S2, and RARE/S3) that resemble the core motifs of RAREs (TGCCCG or TGTCCT) in the 5′-flanking region of the retinol-binding protein gene (53Panariello L. Quadro L. Trematerra S. Colantuoni V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25524-25532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). To assess whether these sites bind RAR proteins, two synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides (Oligo1 and Oligo2) containing these sites were synthesized and radiolabeled for EMSA analysis. Oligo1 (−438 to −470 bp) contains both RARE/S1 and RARE/S2 sites. Oligo2 (−410 to −439 bp) contains the RARE/S3 site. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, both Oligo1 and Oligo2 formed DNA-protein complexes with the purified RAR protein in the EMSA study. The DNA-RAR complexes were specific and supershifted by a polyclonal antibody recognizing RAR. The antibody alone did not form complexes with the oligonucleotides (data not shown). When mutations were introduced into the potential RARE sites in Oligo1 and Oligo2, only a nonspecific band was observed, indicating these sites are required for RAR DNA binding.FIG. 3RAR α binds to RAREs of the hSP-B 5′-flanking enhancer region. Radiolabeled wild type (wt) and mutant (mt) Oligo1 and Oligo2 probes were incubated with the purified RARγ-GST fusion protein (100 μg). Oligo1 represents hSP-B(−438/−470). Oligo2 represents hSP-B(−410/−439). Free probes and DNA-protein complexes were separated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. RAR antibody (Ab) (1 μg) was included to supershift DNA-protein complexes. Arrows indicate RAR-DNA complex formations and supershifts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess whether RARE sites in the enhancer region mediate the stimulatory effect of all-trans-RA on the hSP-B promoter, hSP-B 470 that contains all three putative RARE sites, and hSP-B 417 that lacks RARE sites was cotransfected into H441 cells in the presence or absence of all-trans-RA (10−5m). Whereas hSP-B 470 was still stimulated by all-trans-RA in H441 cells, deletion of the region −417 to −470 (hSP-B 417) caused complete loss of all-trans-RA stimulation (Fig. 4 A). Single mutations RARE/S1, RARE/S2, and RARE/S3 partially inhibited the stimulatory effects of RA on hSP-B 500, whereas double mutations RARES1/S3 completely abolished RA stimulation of the hSP-B 500 promoter (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating that these RARE clustered sites are essential for RA stimulation of the hSP-B promoter. Several nuclear receptor coactivators interact with RAR and form the transcription activation complex that stimulates target gene expression. Since RA and RAR stimulate the hSP-B promoter, we reasoned that these coactivators may interact with RAR to stimulate the hSP-B promoter. In cotransfection and luciferase assay, three such coactivators, ACTR, SRC-1, and TIF-2, significantly stimulated the hSP-B 500 promoter in H441 cells (Fig. 5). Stimulation of hSP-B promoter activity by each coactivator was dose-dependent. In addition to interaction with nuclear receptor coactivators, RAR interacts with CBP, a common and rate-limiting mediator in many signaling pathways (38Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J.

Prolonged activation of the MAPK pathway in p21+/+ or p21−/− hepatocytes caused a large decrease and increase, respectively, in DNA synthesis. Either transfection with RB antisense oligonucleotides, expression of wild type E7, or RB binding mutant E7 (C24S) proteins increased p21 levels and reduced DNA synthesis in p21+/+ hepatocytes. RB antisense oligonucleotides and E7 proteins increased apoptosis in p21+/+, but not p21−/−, hepatocytes. Expression of wild type E7 increased DNA synthesis above control levels in p21−/− cells, which was additive with prolonged MAPK activation. In contrast, expression of mutant E7 did not alter DNA synthesis above control levels in p21−/− cells and was supra-additive with prolonged MAPK activation. Antisense ablation of RB in p21−/− hepatocytes had a weak stimulatory effect upon DNA synthesis itself but enhanced the capacity of mutant E7 protein to stimulate DNA synthesis to the same level observed using wild type E7. The ability of prolonged MAPK activation to stimulate DNA synthesis in the presence of mutant E7 and antisense RB was additive.

In part, this may be due to loss of p53 function, although several studies indicate that childhood hepatomas and early stage adult liver cancers express functional p53 (13Imai Y. Oda H. Arai M.

Indeed, a reduction in the ability of many cell types to increase p21 expression may contribute to the processes of transformation and differentiation (10Auer K.L. Ishac E. Seth P. Coffey R.J.

This could be due to a loss of transcription factor function(s) or due to altered signaling via other pathways that regulate p21 expression,e.g. signaling by the RhoA GTPase (10Auer K.L. Ishac E.

Recently, it was shown that the relative ability of MAPK to increase p21 expression decreased in HepG2 hepatoma cells compared with primary hepatocytes (10Auer K.L. Ishac E. Seth P. Coffey R.J.

In further agreement with the importance of p21 expression in hepatocyte cell cycle control, inducible overexpression of p21 inhibits liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (21Albrecht J.H.

Collectively, these data suggest that regulation of p21 expression and function plays pivotal roles in both the regulation of liver regeneration and in hepatocellular transformation.

This inhibits such processes as ion transport in batteries or in lipid bilayers of cells. Ion penetration across such an interface was studied with unusual structural control. Hydronium ions were soft-landed at 1 electron volt on cold films of 3-methylpentane (""oil"") on a metal substrate. The field produced by these ions drove them through the films when warmed. Coadsorption of water (0.14 to 35 bilayers) inhibited the ion penetration by creating a solvation energy trap. A Born solvation model successfully predicted the trapping energies (0 to 38 kilojoules per mole)."

This detection shows the extended nature of the molecular gas distribution in the host galaxy and the pronounced lensing effects due to the differentially magnified CO luminosity at different velocities. The estimated mass of molecular gas is about 4 x 10(9) solar masses, a molecular gas mass typical of a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way. A second, weaker component of CO is interpreted as arising from a close companion galaxy that is rich in molecular gas and has remained undetected so far. Its estimated molecular gas mass is 1.4 x 10(9) solar masses, and its velocity relative to the main galaxy is 660 kilometers per second. The ability to probe the molecular gas distribution and kinematics of galaxies associated with high-redshift lensed quasars can be used to improve the determination of the Hubble constant H(0)."
