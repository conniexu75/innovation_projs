https://openalex.org/W1966032423,"We describe the molecular characterization of the Drosophila gene crumbs, which encodes an integral membrane protein with 30 EGF-like repeats in the extracellular part and exhibits a striking expression pattern. The protein is exclusively localized on the apical membranes of epithelial cells and concentrated at the borders between cells. Mutations in crumbs lead to severe disruptions in the organization of ectodermally derived epithelia and in some cases to cell death in these tissues. The structure and the expression pattern of the protein and the phenotype of mutations indicate a function of crumbs during the development of epithelia, possibly for the establishment and/or maintenance of cell polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2020520526,"The nuclear envelope is a dynamic structure that completely disassembles in response to MPF/cdc2 activity in mitosis. A key feature of this process is the hyperphosphorylation of the major structural proteins of the envelope, the nuclear lamins A, B, and C. Two highly conserved serine residues of the lamin protein (Ser-22 and Ser-392 of lamins A and C) are symmetrically positioned 5 amino acids from the ends of the large alpha-helical domain and are shown in the accompanying paper by Ward and Kirschner to be among four sites phosphorylated during nuclear envelope breakdown. Mutations in Ser-22 and Ser-392 that prevent phosphorylation at these sites block the disassembly of the nuclear lamina during mitosis. We propose a model for the regulation of lamin assembly in which phosphorylation just outside the ends of the alpha-helical domain controls the assembly dynamics of the lamin coiled-coil dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1974790290,"Lesions of atherosclerosis occur in the innermost layer of the artery wall and consist primarily of proliferated smooth muscle cells surrounded by large amounts of connective tissue, numerous lipid-laden macrophages, and varying numbers of lymphocytes. Growth-regulatory molecules may be involved in intimal accumulation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells responsible for the occlusive lesions of atherosclerosis. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain protein was found within macrophages in all stages of lesion development in both human and nonhuman primate atherosclerosis. Thus macrophages may play a critical role in the disease by providing PDGF, a potent chemotactic and growth-stimulatory molecule, to the intimal smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2069803121,"During development, each tissue receives and maintains a number of specific neuronal projections that are adequate to sustain its function. The mechanism by which this intricate process occurs is not well understood, but it has been proposed that diffusible neurotrophic factors derived from the target tissue may be involved. Here we describe the identification of a novel human protein that is important for the growth, differentiation, and survival of primary sympathetic and placode-derived sensory neurons. This polypeptide, designated neuronotrophin-3, has a broad tissue distribution and is structurally related to both nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Its unique range of trophic and differentiation-inducing activities suggests that it is likely to play a wide role in defining the fate and function of nerve cells during development."
https://openalex.org/W1983319708,"To learn how neural segments are structured in a simple vertebrate, we have characterized the embryonic zebrafish hindbrain with a library of monoclonal antibodies. Two regions repeat in an alternating pattern along a series of seven segments. One, the neuromere centers, contains the first basal plate neurons to develop and the first neuropil. The other region, surrounding the segment boundaries, contains the first neurons to develop in the alar plate. The projection patterns of these neurons differ: those in the segment centers have descending axons, while those in the border regions form ventral commissures. A row of glial fiber bundles forms a curtain-like structure between each center and border region. Specific features of the individual hindbrain segments in the series arise within this general framework. We suggest that a cryptic simplicity underlies the eventual complex structure that develops from this region of the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1995574514,"We compared the internalization and intracellular sorting of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and point mutant kinase-negative EGF-R separately expressed in NIH 3T3 cells lacking endogenous receptor. Both EGF-Rs internalized rapidly, but kinase-negative receptor was surface down-regulated only with monensin or at 20 degrees C. Furthermore, EGF internalized by mutant receptor alone was, in significant proportion, returned to the cell surface undegraded. Hence unlike wild-type receptor, kinase-negative EGF-R recycles. By electron microscopy the early pathways of endocytosis for the two receptors were identical; however, after 10-20 min the pathways diverged at the multivesicular body (MVB). Wild-type EGF-R, destined for degradation, localized to internal vesicles, while kinase-negative EGF-R, destined for recycling, localized to surface membranes of the MVBs and moved to small tubulovesicles. We conclude that sorting of internalized receptor for degradation or recycling can occur through spatial segregation within the MVB, and sorting of EGF-R is controlled by tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1987752224,"We describe a mutant human cell line (LBL 721.174) that has lost a function required for presentation of intracellular viral antigens with class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), but retains the capacity to present defined epitopes as extracellular peptides. The cell also has a defect in the assembly and expression of class I MHC molecules, which we show can be restored by exposure of the cells to a peptide epitope. This phenotype suggests a defect in the association of intracellular antigen with class I molecules similar to that described for the murine mutant RMA-S (ref. 5), but in the present case the genetic defect can be mapped within the MHC locus on human chromosome 6."
https://openalex.org/W2090064498,"We have identified three different point mutations in the coding region of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Each mutation segregates with the disease in two- or three-generation pedigrees and is not found on the normal chromosome of any documented cystic fibrosis carrier. One of the mutations is found in two independent families that contain at least one individual with a mild course of disease. All of these alterations replace charged amino acids with less polar residues and are found in the putative transmembrane sections of the molecule. The mutated amino acids are found to be conserved in both rodents and amphibians and lie in a region of CFTR that is believed to form a channel in the membrane. Although these alterations are rare, they provide important clues to functionally important regions of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1985702485,"The role of polysialic acid (PSA) during initial innervation of chick muscle was examined. Previously, the adhesion molecules L1 and N-CAM were shown to be important in balancing axon-axon and axon-muscle adhesion during this process. Here we demonstrate developmental changes in the pattern of innervation that are not correlated with levels of L1 or N-CAM expression, but rather with the amount of PSA at the axon surface. Removal of PSA by a specific endoneuraminidase (Endo-N) increased axon fasciculation and reduced nerve branching. In contrast, the nerve trunk defasciculation and increased branching produced by neuromuscular activity blockade were associated with an increase in axonal PSA levels. Furthermore, Endo-N prevented these inactivity -induced effects on branching. Together these results illustrate the potential of PSA as a regulator of cell-cell interactions and provide a direct example of a molecular link between the morphogenic effects of adhesion-mediated and synaptic activity-dependent processes."

https://openalex.org/W1976473477,"During exocytosis, secretory vesicles of mast cells generate a current transient that marks the opening of the fusion pore, the first aqueous connection that forms between the vesicle lumen and the cell exterior. By recording and analyzing such current transients, we have tracked the conductance of the fusion pore over the first millisecond of its existence. The first opening of the pore occurs rapidly, generally within 100 microseconds at 23 degrees C. The electric conductance of the pore is a few hundred picosiemens at first, but gradually increases over the subsequent milliseconds. Evidently the pore opens abruptly and then dilates. The initial conductance of the pore suggests a diameter comparable to that of a large ion channel. From an analysis of ""capacitance flicker"" we infer that a pore can increase its diameter severalfold and still close again completely. This suggests that several early events in membrane fusion are reversible."

https://openalex.org/W1583875039,"The platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa complex, a member of the integrin family of adhesive receptors involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, contains binding sites for fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and vitronectin. Absence or defects of this receptor result in the platelet bleeding disorder Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. In this report, we describe the isolation of genomic DNA coding for the entire mature GPIIIa protein. Mature GPIIIa is encoded by 14 exons which range in length from 90 to 3618 base pairs, which are contained within an approximately 46-kilobase (kb) stretch of genomic DNA on chromosome 17. All of the exon/intron junctions were found to conform to the consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences. The coding region of the GPIIIa gene is identical with the previously described cDNA sequence except for three silent substitutions. One substitution creates a TaqI site which may be the site of a known GPIIIa polymorphism. A second substitution eliminates a SmaI site. Aside from the start of the first exon described, which begins at the second base of the first codon of the mature protein, there is no correlation between the organization of the exons in this gene and proposed functional domains of the protein based on analysis of the primary amino acid sequence. The less frequently used polyadenylation signal AAATTAAA was present at the 3'-end of the major RNA transcript. Recently, an alternatively processed GPIIIa transcript has been described. We demonstrate that this transcript results from nonsplicing of the final intron. The description of the GPIIIa gene organization should be of importance in understanding the evolution of the integrin family of receptors and should be useful in the molecular biology analysis of thrombasthenic patients who have a defect in the GPIIIa gene."

https://openalex.org/W2045666881,"Substantial DNA deletions appear to be the molecular basis of several human genetic disorders but rarely account for the majority of observed mutations at any given locus. Exceptions in which deletions do account for the majority of observed abnormalities include the α-thalassemias, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and steroid sulfatase deficiency. Variable deletion breakpoints have been recognized at the α-globin and dystrophin loci, but no information is available regarding STS deletions. We have found that these STS alterations usually involve breakpoints within highly similar sequence elements situated approximately 1.9 megabases apart on the X chromosome. It is surprising that these very large deletions produce such mild clinical abnormalities. These results may provide insight into the molecular mechanism of a number of human genetic defects."
https://openalex.org/W2029626035,"The DNA replication requirement for vaccinia virus late gene expression was mimicked by transfecting a late promoter-controlled reporter gene into infected cells in the presence of a DNA synthesis inhibitor. This late promoter activation block was overcome by cotransfecting either naked linear vaccinia virion DNA or three cloned viral genes encoding trans-activator polypeptides of 17, 26, and 30 kd. These newly identified trans-activator genes were independently transcribed only from replicated or transfected DNA. These data suggest a regulatory cascade in which the parental viral genome serves as a template for the RNA polymerase and early promoter-specific transcription factors that are packaged in the infectious particle; the newly replicated DNA is accessible to sequentially synthesized intermediate promoter- and late promoter-specific trans-activators."
https://openalex.org/W1966794733,"Mice homozygous for deletions around the albino locus fail to activate expression of a set of neonatal liver functions and die shortly after birth. This phenotype is thought to result from the loss of a positive transacting factor, denoted alf, in deletion homozygotes. Using differential cDNA screening, we isolated and characterized genes whose cell type-specific transcription is affected by alf and found as a common feature that expression of these genes is induced by glucocorticoids and cAMP. Surprisingly, a subset of these alf-responsive genes is negatively controlled by the tissue-specific extinguisher locus Tse-1. Administration of glucocorticoids and cAMP leads to reversal of Tse-1-mediated extinction of these genes. These results show that two trans-acting factors coordinately regulate expression of overlapping sets of liver-specific genes. We suggest that both the lethal phenotype and the extinguished state result from interference with hormone signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W2063933196,"Estrogen causes dramatic long-term changes in the activity of the uterus. Here we report the molecular cloning of a small (700 base) uterine mRNA species capable of inducing a slow K+ current in Xenopus oocytes. The 130 amino acid protein encoded by this mRNA species has a predicted structure that does not resemble that of previously described voltage-dependent channels from mammalian sources. It is, however, similar to structural motifs found in certain prokaryotic ion channels. The induction of this mRNA by estrogen is rapid; this uterine mRNA species is not detectable in uteri from estrogen-deprived rats, but is substantially induced after 3 hr of estrogen treatment. These results support a critical role for regulation of ion channel expression by estrogen in the uterus."
https://openalex.org/W1566237859,"mu-Class glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) were identified in all 13 human testes and 28 brains examined; even subjects whose livers were devoid of mu-GSTs expressed extrahepatic GSTs of this class. Testes and brains from individuals with mu-class GSTs in their livers had additional forms that also reflected the liver phenotypes. An isoenzyme with an isoelectric point of 5.2, which was a major GST in testis and present as well in cerebral cortex but not detected in any livers, was identified and purified. Sequence analysis of peptides derived by cleavage of the testicular mu-class GST by Achromobacter protease I revealed distinct aspects of primary structure not found previously in any mammalian mu-class GSTs. These unique features included a blocked and extended amino terminus and 3 additional residues (Pro-Val-Cys) at the carboxyl terminus. This structure was confirmed by molecular cloning and sequencing of cDNAs derived from human testis and brain libraries. In the coding region the mRNA of the brain-testis mu-class GST was 75% homologous with that of the liver form, and its 3'-untranslated sequence was mostly divergent, indicating that it is the product of a separate gene. Distinct catalytic and structural properties of the testis-brain mu-class GSTs suggest that these GSTs may be uniquely involved in blood-barrier functions common to both organs."
https://openalex.org/W1949772518,"MK is a gene that is expressed temporarily during the early stages of retinoic acid-induced differentiation of embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and during the mid-gestation period of mouse embryogenesis. The 5'-regions of MK cDNAs and their mRNAs are heterogeneous; so far three kinds of MK cDNAs (MK1, MK2, and MK3) have been isolated. The MK gene was cloned from a genomic DNA library of a BALB/c mouse, and its structure was elucidated. 5'-Region sequences specific for MK1, MK2, and MK3 were arranged in the order of MK3, MK2, and MK1. Then, there was a sequence common to all MK cDNAs consisting of four exons. The results indicate that different species of MK mRNA are generated by the use of alternative promoters and different modes of splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1578030761,"Tryptic digestion of ABP-120, an actin cross-linking protein from Dictyostelium discoideum, generates a ladder of peptides differing in molecular mass by 13,000 daltons, indicating a structural repeat within the molecule. A number of peptides bind actin with the smallest having a molecular mass of 17,000 daltons (T17). Our sedimentation assays also show that a peptide of 14,000 daltons does not bind actin. Using the full-length cDNA sequence (Noegel, A., Rapp, S., Lottspeich, F., Schleicher, M., and Stewart, M. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 607-618) and protein sequencing techniques, we have determined that T17 begins at residue 89 while T14 begins at residue 116. Therefore we have localized 27 amino acids which are essential for actin binding activity. This region is at the end of the molecule, distal from the repetitive beta-sheet region predicted from the cDNA sequence, and displays high sequence identity with regions in the N termini of ABP/filamin, dystrophin, beta-spectrin, and alpha-actinin."
https://openalex.org/W1556750921,"Secretogranin II is a very acidic, tyrosine-sulfated protein found in secretory granules of cells belonging to the diffuse neuroendocrine system. It gained more general importance recently as a universal immunohistochemical marker for endocrine neoplasms. Sequence information was obtained from secretogranin II isolated from bovine anterior pituitaries, allowing the isolation of cDNA clones and deduction of its primary structure. Bovine secretogranin II is a 586-amino acid protein of 67,455 Da which is preceded by a signal peptide of 27 residues and contains 9 pairs of basic amino acids in its sequence which are used as potential cleavage sites for generation of physiologically active peptides. Moderately abundant mRNA levels were found in adrenal medulla, pituitary, hippocampus, and caudate. Secretogranin II message was absent from parathyroid gland, adrenal cortex, kidney, liver, and spleen. Depolarization of isolated chromaffin cells by various secretagogues significantly up-regulated secretogranin II mRNA levels by mechanisms distinct from those established for chromogranins and neuropeptides, components maintained along with secretogranin II in neuroendocrine storage vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1563135869,"A cDNA library was prepared from mRNA isolated from the lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni during larval-pupal metamorphosis. Differential probing was used to identify clones for mRNAs which are suppressible by exogenous juvenile hormone treatment. In vitro transcribed cRNAs from these clones were translated in vitro and challenged with antiserum specific for a known acidic, juvenile hormone-suppressible hemolymph protein (AJSP-1) that is associated with larval metamorphosis. Three clones were found which encoded immunoreactive translation products; their identity was confirmed by comparison of the N-terminal sequence of the mature AJSP-1 protein with the cDNA sequence. As inferred from the cDNA sequence, the protein encompasses 704 amino acid residues, including a N-terminal signal peptide; widely distributed as well as more localized stronger sequence similarities indicate that the protein is distantly related to hemocyanins and hemocyanin-like insect proteins. However, on the basis of amino acid sequence and composition, immunological reactivity, and hormonal sensitivity, the protein is distinct from previously described insect proteins. Its juvenile hormone suppressibility can be ascribed to suppression of the mRNA. RNA blot analysis using the cloned cDNA as a probe demonstrated that the transcript (approximately 2.8 kilobases) is of very low abundance during the penultimate stadium but becomes very abundant during the last larval stadium, when juvenile hormone rapidly declines. Furthermore, treatment of larvae with a juvenile hormone analog strongly suppresses the abundance of the message."
https://openalex.org/W1975193242,"The expression of the gene encoding the neuroendocrine peptides neurotensin (NT) and neuromedin N is strictly dependent on simultaneous exposure to multiple inducers in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. NT peptide and NT/N mRNA levels are synergistically induced by combinations of NGF, dexamethasone, activators of adenylate cyclase, and lithium ion. We have used transient transfection assays to delineate the rat NT/N gene sequences necessary for this complex regulation. Progressive deletions of the 5' flanking region revealed that sequences between -216 and +56 are sufficient to confer the full spectrum of responses exhibited by the endogenous gene to a reporter gene. Detailed mutational analysis of this region indicates that it is composed of an array of inducible cis-regulatory sequences, including AP-1, cAMP response, and glucocorticoid response elements. Specific mutation of either the AP-1 site or each of two cAMP response elements indicates that they are functionally interdependent. This array of response elements serves to integrate multiple environmental stimuli into a unified transcriptional response."
https://openalex.org/W2070482757,"One of the final stages in the development of egg-laying behavior in the nematode C. elegans is the organization of 8 motor neurons (2 HSN and 6 VC cells) and 8 muscles into a motor system to control the opening of the vulva. Using mutations that disrupt the development of specific components of the egg-laying system and laser microsurgery to ablate selected precursor cells, we have determined that the guidance of the egg-laying neurons and muscles, and in particular the VC neurons and vulval muscles, into the vulval region is dependent on interactions with surrounding epithelial and gonadal tissue and appears to be independent of neuron-neuron and neuron-muscle interactions. The development of the egglaying system can be described as a series of cell interactions in which certain cells arise through induction and subsequently provide inductive cues themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2008665164,Immortalized retinal neurons have been established in tissue culture from retinal tumors arising in transgenic mice. The mice carry the SV40 T-antigen under the control of 5' flanking sequences from the human phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) gene in order to target oncogene expression to adrenergic cell types. The retinal cultures contain a proliferation population of T-antigen-positive cells with a neuronal morphology that includes formation of extensive neuritic processes. We identified the cells as amacrine-derived neurons by immunofluorescence using the cell-specific monoclonal antibodies VC1.1 and HPC-1. The cells also express all three neurofilament subunits and GAP-43. These results indicate that CNS neurons can be transformed in transgenic animals to generate cultured cells with many properties of mature neurons.
https://openalex.org/W1576046815,"Phosphate extraction of mitochondrial creatine kinase (Mi-CK, EC 2.7.3.2) from freshly isolated intact mitochondria of chicken cardiac muscle, after short swelling in hypotonic medium, yielded more than 90% of octameric and only small amounts of dimeric Mi-CK as judged by fast protein liquid chromatography-gel permeation analysis of the supernatants immediately after extraction of the enzyme. In extraction buffer, octameric Mi-CK displayed a tendency to dissociate, albeit at a slow rate with a half-life of approximately 3-5 days, into stable dimers. Experiments with purified Mi-CK octamers or dimers, or defined mixtures thereof, incubated under identical conditions with Mi-CK-depleted mitoplasts revealed that both oligomeric forms of Mi-CK can rebind to mitoplasts. However, the association of Mi-CK was strongly pH-dependent and, in addition, octameric and dimeric Mi-CK showed different pH dependences of rebinding. Therefore, it was possible under certain pH conditions to rebind either both oligomeric forms or selectively the octamers only. Furthermore, evidence is presented that Mi-CK dimers partially form octamers upon rebinding to the inner membrane. The differential association of the two oligomeric Mi-CK forms with the inner mitochondrial membrane together with the dynamic equilibrium between octameric and dimeric Mi-CK (Schlegel, J., Zurbriggen, B., Wegmann, G., Wyss, M., Eppenberger, H.M., and Wallimann, T. (1988) J. Biol. Chem., 263, 16942-16953) suggest that both oligomeric forms are physiologically relevant. A change in the octamer to dimer ratio may influence the association behavior of Mi-CK in general and thus modulate mitochondrial energy flux as discussed in the phosphoryl creatine circuit model (Wallimann, T., Schnyder, T., Schlegel, J., Wyss, M., Wegmann, G., Rossi, A.-M., Hemmer, W., Eppenberger, H.M., and Quest, A.F.G. (1989) Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 315, 159-176."
https://openalex.org/W2009812425,"A subline of U937 cells (U937D) was obtained in which creatine kinase B (CK-B) messenger RNA was present and bound to ribosomes, but CK activity was undetectable. Transformation of U937D cells with retrovirus vectors that contain the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of CK-B messenger RNA exhibited CK activity with no change in abundance of CK-B mRNA. The 3′ UTR formed a complex in vitro with a component of S100 extracts from wild-type cells. This binding activity was not detectable in S100 extracts from cells that expressed CK activity after transformation with the 3′ UTR-containing vector. These results suggest that translation of CK-B is repressed by binding of a soluble factor or factors to the 3′ UTR."
https://openalex.org/W1537614275,"The major protein from the bovine lens fiber cell membranes, the 26-kilodalton protein (major intrinsic protein (MIP26)), has been solubilized in n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and purified by gel filtration. The final preparation was free of detergent micelles. Gel electrophoresis in denaturing conditions has confirmed the purity of the protein sample. A s20,w of 5.55 S, obtained from analytical ultracentrifugation, and a D20,w of 3.62 x 10(-7) cm2 s-1, obtained from photon correlation spectroscopy, resulted in a molar mass of (176,000 +/- 15,000) g/mol for the protein-detergent complex using the Svedberg relation. The measured detergent content of 0.71 g of detergent/g of protein resulted in a calculated partial specific volume of 0.787 cm3/g for the protein-detergent complex and a molar mass of 103,000 g/mol for the protein moiety. This allowed us to conclude that the protein-detergent complex contains four copies of the MIP26 protein, which supports the suggestion that in vivo the MIP26 molecules cluster in tetramers to form a pore-like structure."
https://openalex.org/W1524018512,"Four analogs of the natural cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) were tested for their ability to bind and inhibit the prokaryotic enzyme, EcoRI adenine DNA methylase. The EcoRI methylase transfers the methyl group from AdoMet to the second adenine in the double-stranded DNA sequence 5'GAATTC3'. Dissociation constants (KD) of the binary methylase-analog complexes obtained in the absence of DNA with S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), sinefungin, N-methyl-AdoMet, and N-ethylAdoMet are 225, 43, greater than 1000, and greater than 1000 microM, respectively. In the presence of a DNA substrate, all four analogs show simple competitive inhibition with respect to AdoMet. The product of the enzymic reaction, AdoHcy, is a poor inhibitor of the enzyme (KI(AdoHcy) = 9 microM; KM(AdoMet) = 0.60 microM). Two synthetic analogs, N-methyl-AdoMet and N-ethyl-AdoMet, were also shown to be poor inhibitors with KI values of 50 and greater than 1000 microM, respectively. In contrast, the naturally occurring analog sinefungin was shown to be a highly potent inhibitor (KI = 10 nM). Gel retardation assays confirm that the methylase-DNA-sinefungin complex is sequence-specific. The ternary complex is the first sequence-specific complex detected for any DNA methylase. Potential applications to structural studies of methylase-DNA interactions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2061125820,"Mutation of the Drosophila melanogaster gene no-on-transient A (nonA) results in reduced visual acuity, behavior abnormalities, and an electrophysiological defect for which the mutant is named. We mapped the nonA gene genetically to a 20 kb interval within the 14C1,2 region of the X chromosome, isolated this chromosomal region, and used P element-mediated transformation to delimit the nonA gene to a 9 kb region. Analysis of cDNA clones indicates that this region encodes alternatively spliced transcripts encoding protein products of approximately 77 kd that differ only in their C-terminal 35 amino acids. Analysis of mutations generated in vitro in this transcription unit confirm that these transcripts are the products of the nonA gene."
https://openalex.org/W2019284402,"Conjugate eye movements are executed through the concurrent activation of several muscles in both eyes. The neural mechanisms that underlie such synergistic muscle activations have been a matter of considerable experimentation and debate. In order to investigate this issue, the projections of a class of primate premotoneuronal cells were studied, namely, the vertical medium-lead burst neurons (VMLBs), which drive vertical rapid eye movements. Axons of upward VMLBs ramify bilaterally within motoneuron pools that supply the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles of both eyes. Axons of downward VMLBs ramify ipsilaterally in the inferior rectus portion of the oculomotor nucleus and in the trochlear nucleus. Thus, VMLBs can drive vertical motoneuron pools of both eyes during conjugate vertical rapid eye movements; these data support Hering's law."
https://openalex.org/W1533666462,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) has been purified 35,000-fold to homogeneity from rabbit sciatic nerves using its ability to promote the survival of chick embryo ciliary ganglion neurons as the bioassay. The purification involved a combination of acid treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, chromatofocusing, preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Overlapping peptide sequences were obtained which accounted for 49% of the primary structure of the molecule. This information was used to prepare synthetic peptides in order to elicit antibodies. Purified CNTF exhibited two major and several minor bands between 24 and 22 kDa on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. All of the molecular forms were immunostained in Western blots by antiserum to synthetic peptides. The peptide sequences also provided a basis for cloning and expression of the rabbit CNTF gene (Lin, L-F. H., Mismer, D., Lile, J. D., Armes, L. G., Butler, E. T., III, Vannic, J. L., and Collins, F. (1989) Science 246, 1023-1025) confirming that the protein purified as reported here is CNTF."
https://openalex.org/W1527773506,"By using a radioimmunoassay for neuromedin N (NMN), a hexapeptide in the neurotensin (NT) family, extracts of canine small intestine were found to contain primarily (greater than 75%) large molecular form(s) of NMN, whereas the predominant species in brain was NMN itself. Large NMN was highly basic (pI greater than 9) and during sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis gave two components of approximately 17 kDa (75%) and approximately 8 kDa (25%). Large NMN, like NT, was localized primarily to the mucosal layer of the jejunoileum. It was also present in highly purified (25% pure) mucosal N-cells, where it appeared to be concentrated within dense secretory vesicles. The amino acid sequence of a 21-amino acid fragment cleaved from the C-terminal region of large NMN was identical to residues 128-148 of the canine NT/NMN precursor predicted from cDNA work. These results suggest that tissue-specific processing of the NT/NMN precursor occurs in the dog, giving rise to NMN in brain and large NMN in small intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2129937057,"Lipid X, an early precursor in the biosynthesis of lipid A has been reported to directly induce cytokine release in macrophages but also to inhibit endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induction. In this report we provide evidence that these conflicting results could be due to contaminants present in different batches of lipid X used. Thus, in an apparently batch of crystalline lipid X as obtained by a published procedure (Macher, I. (1987) Carbohydr. Res. 262, 79-84) small amounts of N,O-acylated disaccharide-1-phosphates could be identified. Their isolation was achieved by gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 and further analysis of fractions showing elevated limulus amebocyte lysate values by thin layer chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in combination with bioassays. Identification of immunostimulatory by-products was possible by testing HPLC-fractions for TNF-induction in bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages. Applying these procedures a disaccharide-1-phosphate, containing four 3(R)-hydroxymyristic acids at positions 2, 3, 2', 3', was identified as the main immunostimulatory side product. Two isomeric hydrolysis products of this compound with only three 3(R)-hydroxymyristic acid moieties attached to the disaccharide-1-phosphate were also identified. Surprisingly, these compounds behave quite differently in the TNF induction test. The disaccharide-1-phosphate, acylated at positions 2, 2', 3', is a very potent inducer of TNF-release whereas the corresponding isomer containing the 3(R)-hydroxymyristic acids in positions 2, 3, 2', does not induce TNF release, but strongly inhibits TNF release as induced by the former compound. Thus, contamination of pure lipid X with immunostimulatory or immunoinhibitory impurities may explain the divergent pharmacological profiles which were attributed to synthetic lipid X."
https://openalex.org/W1502565570,"Thyroid hormonogenesis in thyroglobulin results in the conversion of an iodotyrosine to a hormone residue and a iodotyrosine to a dehydroalanine residue. Altogether five acceptor sites have been located as hormone residues in thyroglobulin of different animal species. To search for donor sites, we treated bovine thyroglobulin with 4-aminothiophenol to specifically modify dehydroalanine residues to S-(4-aminophenyl)cysteine (APC) residues, according to the principle of dehydroalanine determination developed by us (Kondo, T., Kondo, Y., and Ui, N. (1988) Mol. Cell. Endocr. 57, 101-106). After digesting thyroglobulin with lysyl endopeptidase, APC-containing peptides were separated from other peptides by trapping them on immobilized naphthylethylenediamine and from each other by size-exclusion and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC patterns showed about 10 APC-containing peptides. Among them, four different peptides were purified by repeated reverse-phase HPLC. The results of partial sequencing of the four peptides by manual Edman degradation disclosed that Tyr5, Tyr926, Tyr1375, and Tyr986 or Tyr1008 are available for hormonogenesis as donor sites. These results strongly suggest that only specific tyrosine residues behave as donors."
https://openalex.org/W1598176357,"The hatching enzyme secreted by the blastula stage sea urchin embryo proteolyzes the fertilization envelope, thereby allowing the embryo to hatch. Using an assay that measures fertilization envelope degradation, we have purified the hatching enzyme by ion-exchange and affinity chromatography from the hatching medium of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryos. The hatching enzyme was found to be a 33-kDa metalloprotease that exhibited a substrate preference for only a minor subset of proteins in the fertilization envelope. Secretion of the hatching enzyme by blastula stage embryos occurred during the 2-h period prior to hatching. The hatching enzyme was initially secreted as a 57-kDa protein, but during purification it was converted to the 33-kDa form. Biosynthesis of the hatching enzyme began at the late morula/early blastula stage up to 6 h before secretion. Experiments using the ionophore monensin suggest that the lag between synthesis and secretion of the hatching enzyme by the blastula stage embryos may be a result of a slow constitutive secretory process."
https://openalex.org/W1492313802,"The Mr 38,050 monomeric EcoRI DNA methylase is part of a bacterial restriction-modification system. The methylase transfers the methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to the second adenine in the double-stranded DNA sequence 5'-GAATTC-3'. We have used the radiolabeled photoaffinity analog 8-azido-S-adenosylmethionine (8-N3-AdoMet) to identify peptides at the AdoMet binding site in the binary methylase-cofactor analog complex. The dissociation constants in the absence of DNA for the analog and AdoMet are 12.9 and 4.8 microM, respectively. The apparent kcat and Km values, obtained with the double-stranded DNA substrate 5'-CGCGAATTCGCG-3', are 5.0 s-1 and 0.710 microM (8-N3-AdoMet) and 4.3 s-1 and 0.335 microM (AdoMet). Photolabeling by 8-N3-AdoMet occurs upon irradiation with ultraviolet light and is inhibited by AdoMet. Digestion of the adducted methylase with subtilisin generated several radiolabeled peptides. Peptide sequencing from independent photolabeling experiments revealed two radiolabeled peptides containing amino acids 206-212 and 213-221. Instability of the adducted peptides precluded assignment of modified amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1495958634,"The production of total amounts of 1,2-diacylglycerol as well as those specifically derived from inositol lipid hydrolysis was studied in intact rat resistance arteries stimulated with either noradrenaline, vasopressin, or angiotensin II at 20 s when the onset of contraction would be nearing its maximum, and at 5 min during the sustained phase of contraction. Total amounts of 1,2-diacylglycerol were not altered by any agonist at 20 s, or at 5 min. However, arachidonate-containing species of 1,2-diacylglycerol were differentially influenced being increased at 5 min by noradrenaline, and decreased at 20 s and 5 min by vasopressin. Only angiotensin II produced substantial increases in this class of 1,2-diacylglycerol at both time points. In order to investigate the fate of this second messenger total and inositol lipid derived phosphatidic acids were then measured at both 20 s and 5 min. Noradrenaline induced a rise in both total and arachidonate-containing phosphatidic acid at both times as did vasopressin. Only small increases were induced by angiotensin II at 20 s. These data demonstrate that the accumulation of 1,2-diacylglycerol generated from inositol lipid breakdown is only observed with activation by angiotensin II. Other agonists produced phosphatidic acids with time and the rate of generation of these lipids is agonist-specific. Thus phosphatidic acid may play a more prominent role during the sustained phase of contraction than previously anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W1523362802,"Vanadate is a phosphate analogue that inhibits enzymes involved in phosphate release and transfer reactions (Simons, T. J. B. (1979) Nature 281, 337-338). Since such reactions may play important roles in endocytosis, we studied the effects of vanadate on various steps in receptor-mediated endocytosis of asialoorosomucoid labeled with 125I-tyramine-cellobiose (125I-TC-AOM). The labeled degradation products formed from 125I-TC-AOM are trapped in the lysosomes and may therefore serve as lysosomal markers in subcellular fractionation studies. Vanadate reduced the amount of active surface asialoglycoprotein receptors approximately 70%, but had no effect on the rate of internalization and retroendocytosis of ligand. The amount of surface asialoglycoprotein receptors can be reduced by lowering the incubation temperature gradually from 37 to 15 degrees C (Weigel, P. H., and Oka, J. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5089-5094); vanadate affected only the temperature--sensitive receptors. Vanadate inhibited degradation of 125I-TC-AOM 70-80%. Degradation was much more sensitive to vanadate than binding; half-maximal effects were seen at approximately 1 mM vanadate for binding and approximately 0.1 mM vanadate for degradation. By subcellular fractionation in sucrose and Nycodenz gradients, it was shown that vanadate completely prevented the transfer of 125I-TC-AOM from endosomes to lysosomes. Therefore, the inhibition of degradation by vanadate was indirect; in the presence of vanadate, ligand did not gain access to the lysosomes. The limited degradation in the presence of vanadate took place in a prelysosomal compartment. Vanadate did not affect cell viability and ATP content."
https://openalex.org/W1967994087,The optimal use of natural family planning (NFP) requires the daily measurement of basal body temperature combined with examination of cervical mucus to estimate the onset of ovulation. Popularity and efficacy of the method are low mainly because of the required lengthy abstinence from intravaginal coitus; reliance upon the sympto-thermal method of NFP requires an average of 17 days of such abstinence. The accurate measurement of certain biochemical changes however could reduce the required period of abstinence by more than 50% and boost the popularity and use of NFP. Home tests could be used to detect hormonal changes in a womans saliva and urine over the course of her menstrual cycle. Indeed it is now possible to accurately measure the increase in progesterone metabolites in a few drops of urine. The use of two dipsticks to measure estradiol and progesterone levels in saliva would however be ideal. Research and development efforts are needed to that end. This latter approach would require no toxicology US Food and Drug Administration scrutiny should be much shorter than with drugs legal exposure would be minimal and the undertaking is within the technical and financial resources of relatively small diagnostic companies. The level of market demand for such home tests remains undetermined. Women attempting to avoid unwanted pregnancies as well as female athletes flight attendants traversing multiple time zones on a regular basis and professional women postponing childbearing until their late thirties can all potentially benefit from tools capable of increasing their individual awareness of their fertile periods.
https://openalex.org/W1603894027,"Coagulation factor V (fV) is a single-chain glycoprotein (Mr 330,000; domain structure A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2) that is activated to factor Va (fVa; Mr 174,000) by thrombin, which cleaves away the B domain leaving a heterodimeric structure composed of a heavy chain (A1-A2; Mr 94,000) and a light chain (A3-C1-C2; Mr 74,000). We analyzed the ultrastructure of scanning transmission electron microscope images of bovine and human fV, bovine fVa, and its constituent light chains and heavy chains. Factor V molecules had irregularly globular (10-12 nm) to oblong (8-14 nm) core structures which commonly displayed a peripheral satellite appendage of variable morphology attached to the core by a narrow stalk. Scanning transmission electron microscope mass analyses indicated that monomolecular bovine fV molecules had a mass of 322 +/- 45 kDa and human fV, 315 +/- 31 kDa. Factor Va molecules were irregular, globular (8-12 nm) structures that resembled the fV core structure, lacked the satellite appendage representing B domainal structures, and had a mass of 180 +/- 22 kDa. Our findings permit us to propose a structural model of fV suggesting the relative orientation of its closely associated light chain and heavy chain core components and indicating that these constituents remain associated in the transition from fV to fVa."

This protein, purified to apparent homogeneity by DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatography, appeared on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as a single polypeptide band of molecular mass of 68 kDa. The polypeptide after extraction from the gel matrix and subsequent renaturation bound specifically to the recognition sequences (-88 to -125) and protected the same region of the promoter against DNase I digestion."

There is little reason to assume that it importantly curtails unreasonably dangerous conduct, yet there is good reason to conclude that it promotes socially undesirable behavior. Moreover, the tort law system ill serves the goal of individual justice, in part because it assumes that lay juries can correctly decide complex scientific issues. Several methods of replacing tort law with other compensation systems are surveyed and a specific, balanced reform package is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1565666584,"Abstract The rat hepatic S14 gene is regulated by L-triiodothyronine (T3) and codes for a cytosolic protein (pI 4.9 and Mr 17,010) that is believed to be involved in lipogenesis. Recent studies have identified at least five DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS 1-5) in hepatic chromatin flanking the 5' region of the gene. The HS-1 site is situated immediately adjacent to the transcription initiation site. We have isolated a DNA fragment (USS-1) which contains a portion of the HS-1 site to examine the binding of nuclear proteins to S14 DNA. DNase I footprinting studies demonstrated that material extracted from hepatic nuclei with 0.42 M NaCl contained proteinase K-sensitive factors (presumed to be proteins), which bind to USS-1 DNA between positions -63 and -48 (PS-1) relative to the transcription initiation site. Examination of the binding activity with a synthetic oligonucleotide identical to the protected sequence indicated the formation of at least three protein-DNA complexes. The DNA binding activity of the PS-1 binding protein or proteins correlated with the T3 regulated expression of mRNA-S14. Although the nucleotide sequence of PS-1 closely resembles the binding site for the CCAAT transcription factor (CTF/NF-1), competition studies attempting to displace protein binding from the PS-1 sequence with DNA fragments containing the CTF/NF-1 binding motif were unsuccessful. In vitro transcriptional assay studies suggested that the DNA fragment (-441 to -2) containing the PS-1 site promotes the transcription of the S14 gene in an orientation fashion. The in vitro transcriptional activity of the S14 DNA containing the PS-1 sequence was significantly higher in hepatonuclear extracts from hyperthyroid compared with euthyroid or hypothyroid animals. In summary, our findings indicate that the DNA binding activity of proteins which bind to PS-1 site is influenced by the thyroid status of the animal."
https://openalex.org/W1560517054,"In this communication we identify and initially characterize two antagonistic activities in a Xenopus oocyte extract that can modulate the in vitro transcription of RNA polymerase III (pol III) genes (5 S RNA and tRNA genes). It was found that preincubation of an inhibitory factor, referred to here as fraction I, with fractions containing TFIIIB and TFIIIC/pol III leads to the loss of a reaction's ability to support transcription. This inactivation process, which required ATP or adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (but could not use ADP), occurred only in the absence of a 5 S RNA or tRNA gene containing plasmid. Under conditions in which transcription was lost, a loss in TFIIIC's ability to specifically bind to the tRNA gene was also observed. An activity found in the A fraction, which was first recognized for its ability to stimulate transcription, was found to inhibit and actually reverse the observed inactivation of transcription. This activity, referred to here as fraction A2, accomplished this reactivation regardless of whether the gene was present or not, but only when a hydrolyzable form of ATP was used in the inactivation process. Transcription in an inactivated reaction could also be restored by addition of fresh transcription factors. The data presented in this paper are consistent with a model in which fraction I and fraction A2 modulate transcription through the activation and inactivation of one or more positive transcription factors."
