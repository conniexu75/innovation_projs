https://openalex.org/W2100561376,"The known correlation between the color of human skin and latitude (Fig. 2) is explainable in terms of two opposing positive adaptations to solar ultraviolet radiation, weak in northern latitudes in winter yet powerful the year around near the equator. In northern latitudes there is selection for white skins that allow maximum photoactivation of 7-dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D at low intensities of ultraviolet radiation. In southern latitudes, on the other hand, there is selection for black skins able to prevent up to 95 percent of the incident ultraviolet from reaching the deeper layers of the skin where vitamin D is synthesized. Selection against the twin dangers of rickets on the one hand and toxic doses of vitamin D on the other would thus explain the world-wide correlation observed between skin pigmentation and nearness to the equator."
https://openalex.org/W2051784785,"After tritiated leucine was injected into the eye of goldfish, radio-active protein synthesized by the ganglion cell bodies moved down the optic axons at an average rate of 0.4 mm per day. Radioautograms of the optic tectum in which these axons end show that, as early as 24 hours after the injection, before the radioactivity in the tectal layer containing the optic axons had risen above background level, the layer containing the axon terminals was already heavily labeled. The radioactivity in the terminals reached a maximum about 48 hours after the injection and remained approximately constant for at least 23 days thereafter, whereas the radioactivity in the fiber layer increased significantly during the same interval, as the slowly moving protein component entered it. Thus there appears to be a special mechanism for rapid transport of protein from the cell body to the synaptic terminals, as well as a slower movement of protein down the axon."

The nervous correlates of sensory and motor activities can be monitored in single cells of the intact animal. Similarly, discrete responses in local muscles of the body wall and complex behavioral sequences such as turning and swimming are triggered by stimulation of single identifiable units."

https://openalex.org/W2018964283,A significant increase of chromosomal abnormalities was found in leukocytes from LSD-25 users (six out of eight) compared to nonuser controls (one out of nine). The two LSD-25 users showing no damage reported the lowest estimated average dose. The subjects whose cells showed damage were tested between 1 day and 6 months after their last LSD-25 dose.
https://openalex.org/W1569780631,"Abstract Allopurinol (4-hydroxypyrazolo-(3,4-d)pyrimidine) and oxoallopurinol (4,6-dihydroxypyrazolo-(3,4-d)pyrimidine) are converted by purine nucleoside phosphorylase to the 1-ribosyl derivatives. Ribose 1-phosphate, inosine, and xanthosine can serve as ribosyl donors in this reaction. Allopurinol is a much better substrate than is oxoallopurinol. 1-Ribosylallopurinol, synthesized enzymatically or chemically, is identical with the ribonucleoside of allopurinol isolated from the urines of patients treated with allopurinol. Oxoallopurinol is converted by uridine phosphorylase to the 7-ribosyl derivative. A ribonucleoside of oxoallopurinol isolated from the urine of a patient treated with allopurinol is identical with enzymatically synthesized 7-ribosyloxoallopurinol."
https://openalex.org/W1604005311,"Pyrocatechase was purified from extracts of benzoate-induced cells of Pseudomonas arvilla. The most purified preparation had a specific activity of 29.6, about 50% higher than that previously reported, and was homogeneous as judged by ultracentrifugation and by electrophoresis. The molecular weight was estimated to be approximately 90,000. The enzyme contained 2 g atoms of iron per mole of enzyme protein. Although the chemical determination of the valency state of iron has given inconclusive results, experiments with various chelating agents and the effects of oxidizing and reducing agents indicated that the iron in the native enzyme may be in the trivalent state. The concentrated solution of highly purified pyrocatechase had a pronounced red color with a broad absorption between 390 and 650 mµ. The peak was at about 440 mµ, and the molecular absorbance at 440 mµ was estimated to be 4670. The trivalent iron bound to the enzyme appears to be responsible for the visible absorption band and functions as an integral part of the enzyme, since under a variety of conditions a loss of enzyme activity occurred in parallel with the disappearance of the absorbance in the visible range. By the addition of the substrate, catechol, under anaerobic conditions, the color of the enzyme solution changed to greyish blue with a concurrent increase of the absorbance at about 710 mµ indicating the possible formation of enzyme-substrate complex. This change of absorption spectrum was restored to the original level after catechol was degraded to cis,cis-muconic acid by the addition of oxygen. In light of the above findings, a plausible reaction mechanism of pyrocatechase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1578392322,"Kinetic data for the inhibition of phosphorylase b by adenosine di- and triphosphate and glucose 6-phosphate have been compared with predictions from the theoretical model for allosteric transitions proposed by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (6). The substrate, inorganic orthophosphate, shows homotropic cooperativity at low concentrations, and this cooperativity is increased as the concentration of the activator, AMP, is decreased. The homotropic cooperativity of the substrates, Pi or glucose-1-P, is expressed more strongly and at higher concentrations as the above inhibitors are added, and these effects are proportional to the concentration of the inhibitor. The activator shows homotropic cooperativity at low concentrations. Decreasing the substrate concentration does not appear to affect the strength of this cooperativity although the apparent Km values are increased. Adding an inhibitor appears to increase the homotropic cooperativity of AMP and causes it to be expressed at a higher concentration. The inhibitor, ATP, shows homotropic cooperativity which, measured indirectly by kinetic methods, appears to increase as Pi or AMP is decreased. AMP and substrate act in concert to antagonize the inhibition by ATP. Uridine diphosphate glucose, which is a competitive inhibitor for Pi or glucose-1-P, activates the enzyme in the presence of ATP at low substrate concentrations. With some exceptions in the realm of the homotropic cooperativity of activator or inhibitor, these results are in qualitative agreement with the theoretical model cited above. Quantitative agreement has been demonstrated for several situations."
https://openalex.org/W1487812723,"Abstract A flavoprotein containing flavin mononucleotide has been isolated from Azotobacter vinelandii, purified to homogeneity, and crystallized. Anaerobically prepared flavoprotein exhibited free radical properties and absorption maxima at 580 and 615 mµ, suggestive of a flavin semiquinone. The flavoprotein is unusual in that the oxidized form reacts slowly even with strong reducing agents (Na2S2O4) and is resistant to reduction beyond the half-reduced state; anaerobically prepared flavoprotein is exceptionally resistant to oxidation by molecular oxygen. These unusual properties have been shown to be dependent upon the structural integrity of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W2019847422,"As Andrews and I examined the conditions under which scientists and engineers did effective work, we observed a number of apparent paradoxes. Achievement was high under conditions that seemed inconsistent, including on the one hand sources of stability or confidence (what I have called ""security"") and on the other hand sources of disruption or intellectual conflict (that is, ""challenge""). It appears that, if both are present, the creative tension between them can promote technical achievement."
https://openalex.org/W1495604557,"The activity of chitin synthetase, the enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of chitin from uridine diphosphate acetylglucosamine, has been studied in various stages of the life cycle of the aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii. This organism contains a chitinous wall in the cellular form, which is missing from the spore. However, both the spores and the cells contain chitin synthetase activity and therefore the absence of a chitinous cell wall in the spore cannot be accounted for by the absence of the particular polysaccharide synthetase involved. Both the enzyme in the cells and that in the spores are activated by addition of acetylglucosamine, and it has been demonstrated that 14C-acetylglucosamine is incorporated into the product of the reaction. It is also apparent that diacetylchitobiose is an intermediate in synthesis of chitin and the data obtained suggest that the utilization of diacetylchitobiose is the rate-limiting step in the over-all reaction. Some other properties of the enzyme activities in spores and in cells have been investigated, and, although some small differences have been observed, it has not yet been possible to obtain evidence that one of them may be physiologically inactive. Thus, some other explanation for the absence of a chitinous cell wall in the spores must be sought."

https://openalex.org/W2001113226,"The rapid development of NMR spectroscopy has been characterized by a succession of discrete, significant advances in instrumentation, as well as by less dramatic but cumulatively important improvements in instrument performance, experimental techniques, spectral analysis, and theory. Most significant are the advances in magnet technology, which within 13 years increased the available field strengths from 7.04 to 51.7 kilogauss (with corresponding increase in the PMR frequency from 30 to 220 megahertz). Great improvements in spectrometer stability and in the coupling of spectrometers with on-line computers have so improved sensitivity that some nuclei possessing less favorable NMR characteristics can now be studied."
https://openalex.org/W2064345107,"During sleep there is a two- to threefold increase in the incorporation of inorganic orthophosphate-32P into a chemical fraction of the brain of the 20-day-old rat. This increase is not in the lipids or nucleic acids, but is associated with an acid-labile phosphate entity of the tissue residue after extraction of these fractions and phosphorus-containing substances of low molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W1481921886,"Abstract Carboxymethyl and carboxamidomethyl derivatives of sperm whale ferrimyoglobin were prepared by reaction near pH 6.7 with bromoacetate and iodoacetamide, respectively. As had been established earlier, unless the reaction was carried to an extreme stage in the modification of histidine residues, the derivatives obtained were stable at neutral pH. The derivatives were generally less stable than the unreacted protein at high pH values, as judged by measurements of absorption and optical rotatory spectra. Of the two types of derivatives, the less highly negatively charged carboxamidomethyl myoglobin proved the more stable at pH 11.5 and above. In acid solution at pH 3.2 or pH 2.2, the derivatives, like the unreacted protein, showed a characteristically fully altered absorption spectrum. Optical rotatory measurements showed, however, that the apparent helix content decreased between pH 3.2 and pH 2.2. The decrease was least marked with the less strongly positively charged carboxymethyl myoglobin preparations. Both types of derivative behaved much like the unreacted protein in experiments in which the optical rotation at 233 mµ was studied as a function of temperature up to 80° or 85°. At these highest temperatures, the apparent order of stability was unreacted myoglobin g carboxamidomethyl derivative g carboxymethyl derivative, and aggregation with precipitation developed in a few minutes. The unreacted protein showed little or no tendency to redissolve on recooling to 23°. However, both derivatives were recovered to the extent of about 60% as apparently native protein. It was concluded that although electrostatic factors probably played a discernible role in determining the relative stabilities of the proteins at extremes of pH, such factors were not prominent in affecting the conformational transitions at high temperatures. Either modified derivative proved much better able to recover the native conformation on cooling than the unreacted protein. It is suggested that the advantage in having the external histidine residues modified may lie in the coding introduced to specify that such residues shall remain at all times in a hydrophilic environment, and not become trapped in erroneous, internal conformational variants."
https://openalex.org/W2007161827,"When rabbit reticulocytes are incubated with n-butanol, an agent disruptive to the structure and function of cellular membranes, there is a rapid disaggregation of the polyribosomes. Reaggregation is promoted when the n-butanol is diluted below a critical concentration or when the cells are washed free of the alcohol and the incubation is continued. Neither disaggregation nor regeneration will occur in the absence of protein synthesis. These observations suggest that integrity of the reticulocyte membrane is necessary for the attachment of ribosomes to messenger RNA and for the formation of polyribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1533759291,"Abstract The binding of thionine (3,6-diaminophenothiazine) to trypsin is associated with a red shift in the visible absorption spectrum of the dye. Spectrophotometric titration and equilibrium dialysis measurements are consistent with the presence of a single thionine-binding site on the trypsin molecule. At pH 7 and 4°, Kdiss for the trypsin-thionine complex is 1.2 x 10-5 m. The dye is displaced from trypsin by substrates, competitive inhibitors, and the chemically reactive substrate analogue 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone. Thus, the thionine-binding site overlaps with the active site region in trypsin. The dye binds very weakly to trypsinogen, with little spectral perturbation. Thionine, at low concentrations, also binds at a single site on chymotrypsin and chymotrypsinogen, showing the same spectral characteristics and a Kdiss value of 4.5 x 10-4 m at pH 7.0 and 4°. The binding of thionine to chymotrypsin is not affected by substrates, inhibitors, or chemically reactive substrate analogues; hence, the thionine-binding site in chymotrypsin does not appear to include any part of the active site region."
https://openalex.org/W2075158123,"Measurements of maximum isometric tension and rate of onset of tension in fibers of glycerinated rat muscle indicate that the red soleus fibers develop significantly higher tensions than do white medial gastrocnemius fibers. Gastrocnemius fibers develop tension at a significantly faster rate than soleus fibers, however. These differences seem to be related to formation of actinmyosin cross-links."
https://openalex.org/W2032777456,"My general conclusion, then, is that, given the current state of biological science, there may be good heuristic reasons for not attempting in all possible areas to develop physicochemical explanations of biological phenomena, and good reasons for attempting to formulate specifically biological theories. This, however, is an argument which supports an irreducibility thesis for methodological reasons. Any attempt to twist this into a claim of real irreducibility for all time is, in the light of recent work in molecular biology, logically untenable, empirically unwarranted, and heuristically useless."

Supernatant medium of cultured node cells from genetically identical donors contains no leukotactic activity. The degree of the cell accumulation seemed to parallel closely the degree of histoincompatibility."
https://openalex.org/W1560904191,"A novel compound, 4-amino-4-cyanobutyric acid, was isolated and identified from cultures of an unidentified psychrophilic basidiomycete. Triple labeling experiments in vivo involving the simultaneous administration of K13C15N and succinic semialdehyde-14C to fungus cultures showed that these compounds along with ammonia are precursors of 4-amino-4-cyanobutyric acid. In addition, cell-free extracts were able to catalyze this reaction. That 4-amino-4-cyanobutyric acid is a precursor of glutamate was also established by triple labeling experiments as well as with crude enzyme preparations. In the latter case nitrilase activity was demonstrated. Enzymes involved in glutamate and succinic semialdehyde metabolism were found, and on this basis a cycle involving cyanide detoxification is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1983831799,The level of activity of the ornithine-urea cycle is low in the liver of the permanently aquatic Australian lungfish. The rate of incorporation of (14)C-bicarbonate into urea by liver slices was only 100th of that previously observed in the estivating African lungfish Protopterus dolloi. The activities of enzymes of the ornithine-urea cycle were similarly reduced. The low activity of this cycle in Neoceratodus is consistent with its exclusively aquatic nature.

https://openalex.org/W2078314999,"Subjects who were administered thiopental showed a loss of memory for events discussed while they were under sedation. We tested the subjects for recognition memory of pictures and recall of associated pairs of letters and words, and found that the subsequent memory loss was correlated with the concentration of thiopental in the venous blood at the time the material was learned. Retention did not appear to be state-dependent because the subject, while under sedation, could recall material learned prior to sedation, and because recall was not facilitated by reinstatement of the sedation."
https://openalex.org/W1642060083,"Abstract The formation of easily dissociable dimers by lyophilization from 50% acetic acid, first demonstrated with ribonuclease A, has now been shown to occur with similar yields with either 3-carboxymethylhistidine-12 ribonuclease (3-CMHis-12-RNase) or 1-carboxymethylhistidine-119 ribonuclease (1-CMHis-119-RNase). Lyophilization of a mixture of monomers, such as ribonuclease A and 1-CMHis-119-RNase or 3-CMHis-12-RNase and 1-CMHis-119-RNase, yields a dimer fraction which, as expected from earlier work, is a mixture of homologous and hybrid dimers. Each type of dimer, whether homologous or hybrid, is resolved by ion exchange chromatography into two isomers, Forms I and II, analogous to those reported for the dimer of ribonuclease A. The hybrid dimers of ribonuclease A and 1-CMHis-119-RNase, in both Forms I and II, were prepared by two routes: (a) by lyophilization of the mixed monomers and (b) by alkylation of each of the dimers of ribonuclease A. The catalytic and chromatographic properties of the dimers did not depend on the route of formation. Alkylation did not result in isomerization between Forms I and II. A slight difference in conformation involving areas of the molecule remote from the active site remains the most likely explanation for the existence of these two isomers. In addition to gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 and chromatography on sulfoethyl Sephadex in phosphate buffers, rapid chromatography on Amberlite IRC-50 with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer has been used in the resolution of dimers. A comparison of the stabilities of some dimers shows that, at pH 7.45, the presence of a 3-CMHis-12 residue tends to destabilize the molecule, whereas the presence of a 1-CMHis-119-119 residue exerts a stabilizing effect. Each hybrid dimer of ribonuclease A and 1-CMHis-119-RNase and of 3-CMHis-12-RNase and 1-CMHis-119-RNase has 50 ± 5% of the specific activity of ribonuclease monomer toward 2',3'-cyclic cytidylate. This supports the postulate that each of these dimers has one reconstructed active site with essentially full activity."
https://openalex.org/W2043287345,"Random-line stereograms were generated in which the only monocular cues were minute breaks occurring at random in thin vertical (or horizontal) line grids. The breaks were binocularly correlated. The stereograms yielded global stereopsis (of a square standing out in front of a surface) even with monocular breaks of as little as 16 seconds of arc, which is below the threshold for resolving two lines. This technique led to the clarification of relations between local and global stereopsis."
