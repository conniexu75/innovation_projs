https://openalex.org/W2017833988,"In recent years major progress has been made in the area of heterogeneous catalysis by metals. Much has been learned about the nature of metal catalysts and of catalytic phenomena on metals. Characteristic patterns of catalytic behavior among the metallic elements have been established for certain classes of reactions, and these patterns provide a first step toward a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic specificity. Studies on metal alloys and related bimetallic catalysts have revived interest in a geometric factor in surface catalysis to complement the traditional electronic factor. Closely related to this geometric factor is the discovery that selectivity, rather than activity alone, is a major factor in reactions on bimetallic catalysts. Concurrent with progress in understanding how catalysts work, advances are also being made in the development of new catalyst systems, examples of which are the bimetallic (or polymetallic) cluster catalysts. Research in this area provides an example of how advances in catalyst technology can be realized within a framework of fundamental research on catalytic phenomena (38)."

To explain this small fractionation, it is proposed that oxygen pressure in the earth's atmosphere was very low and that local oxidation occurred in a photosynthetic layer of the ocean."

https://openalex.org/W1989734008,"North American populations of cocklebur Xanthium strumarium L. are diverse in form and show critical dark periods ranging from 7.75 to 10.75 hours (critical photoperiods of 13.25 to 16.25 hours). South American cockleburs also are diverse in form and response. American cockleburs are adapted to diverse ecosystems, which suggests that they are indigenous. In contrast, the widespread Australian populations known as Noogoora Burr are all of the chinense morphological complex and respond uniformly to photoperiod. Plants from southern Louisiana and Australia are nearly identical in external form and in critical dark period of 10.5 hours. Probably the Australian Noogoora Burr and the Indian monsoon form arrived in their present countries after 1800 as contaminants in cottonseed from the Mississippi Delta region."
