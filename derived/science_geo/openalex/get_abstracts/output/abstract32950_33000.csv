https://openalex.org/W2006309458,"A random-primed complementary DNA library was constructed from plasma containing the uncharacterized non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) agent and screened with serum from a patient diagnosed with NANBH. A complementary DNA clone was isolated that was shown to encode an antigen associated specifically with NANBH infections. This clone is not derived from host DNA but from an RNA molecule present in NANBH infections that consists of at least 10,000 nucleotides and that is positive-stranded with respect to the encoded NANBH antigen. These data indicate that this clone is derived from the genome of the NANBH agent and are consistent with the agent being similar to the togaviridae or flaviviridae. This molecular approach should be of great value in the isolation and characterization of other unidentified infectious agents."

https://openalex.org/W2125630219,"To investigate the possible function(s) of T cell receptor (TcR) gamma delta expressing lymphocytes, we generated a series of gamma delta TcR surface positive hybridomas. Spontaneous producers of IL-2 were quite common among these hybridomas, particularly those expressing a certain V delta gene or gene family (V delta M23). Several other experiments indicated that IL-2 production in these hybridomas is triggered via TcR gamma delta. Surprisingly, every spontaneously reactive gamma delta+ hybridoma was further stimulated by purified protein derivative (PPD) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, perhaps due to crossreaction with a bacterial antigen homologous to certain eukaryotic heat shock proteins. The finding of an antigen recognized by a gamma delta TcR could aid in understanding the functional role of the gamma delta TcR+ lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1985695716,"Although the immunologic role of T cells bearing the conventional alpha beta T cell receptor (TCR) has been well characterized, little is known about the function of the population of T cells bearing the gamma delta TCR. Therefore, the role of gamma delta T cells in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) was investigated. The number of TCR gamma delta cells in the draining lymph nodes of mice immunized with MT was greatly increased in comparison with the number of TCR alpha beta cells. Three biochemically distinct gamma delta TCRs were detected. Analyses of cell cycle, of interleukin-2 receptor expression, and of interleukin-2 responsiveness showed that a large proportion of the gamma delta T cells were activated in vivo. TCR gamma delta cells responded to solubilized MT antigens in vitro but, in contrast to MT-specific alpha beta T cells, the response of gamma delta T cells to MT did not require major histocompatability complex class II recognition. These results provide an example of antigen-specific activation of gamma delta T cells in vivo and indicate that gamma delta T cells may have a distinct role in generating a primary immune response to certain microorganisms."

PAP-I was labeled with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (1 mol/mol); this derivative had anticoagulant activity identical to the unlabeled protein and could be used to measure Ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipid vesicles through changes in fluorescence quenching. At 1.2 mM Ca2+, 0.50 M ionic strength, pH 7.4, 25 degrees C, fluorescein-labeled PAP-I bound to phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine, 20% phosphatidylserine with a Kd of 1.2 +/- 0.2 nM (mean +/- S.D.). At an ionic strength of 0.15 M, the Kd decreased to less than 0.1 nM. Prothrombin and factor Xa both competed with fluorescein-labeled PAP-I for binding to anionic phospholipid vesicles, but with affinities at least 1000-fold weaker than PAP-I. PAP-I bound only weakly (Kd greater than 2 x 10(-5) M) to neutral or anionic phospholipid monomers, and this binding was not calcium-dependent. These results show that the affinity of PAP-I for anionic phospholipid surfaces is sufficient to explain its potency as an in vitro anticoagulant."
https://openalex.org/W1482264334,"Acetaminophen (250 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally to fasted, phenobarbital-induced mice produced hepatotoxicity. No hepatotoxicity was observed after the administration of the regioisomer 3′-hydroxyacetanilide (600 mg/kg). Similar levels of covalent binding to liver homogenates occurred in mice receiving either acetaminophen or 3′-hydroxyacetanilide at these doses. However, subcellular fractionation techniques revealed that the acetaminophen treatment produced greater levels of covalent binding to mitochondrial proteins than 3′-hydroxyacetanilide. In addition, acetaminophen depleted mitochondrial glutathione levels more extensively than 3′-hydroxyacetanilide. Plasma membrane calcium-ATPase activity was reduced to 79.8% and 55.7% of control values at 1 h and 6 h, respectively, following the administration of acetaminophen. No inhibition of this enzyme was detected in mice receiving 3′-hydroxyacetanilide. Acetaminophen also induced alterations in mitochondrial calcium levels and decreased the ability of isolated mitochondria to sequester calcium. These effects were not produced by 3′-hydroxyacetanilide. Our results indicate that acetaminophen induces alterations in calcium homeostasis while 3′-hydroxyacetanilide does not."

In HIV-infected humans, T-cell proliferative responses are lost soon after infection7,8. Here we demonstrate that interleukin-2 production is often retained even when proliferative activity is absent, and that it can be used to monitor T-helper cell responses by HIV-seropositive donors. We use this approach to investigate the T-helper cell response of 42 asymptomatic HIV-seropositive patients to four synthetic gp160 peptides and to influenza A virus, an antigen requiring intact CD4 T-helper cell function. As many as 67% of the HIV-seropositive donors who retain responsiveness to influenza A virus respond to a single peptide, and 85–90% responded to at least one of the peptides."

It is composed of an IgE-binding alpha subunit, a beta subunit, and two gamma subunits. The human alpha subunit was expressed on transfected cells in the presence of rat beta and gamma subunits or in the presence of the gamma subunit alone. The IgE binding properties of the expressed human alpha were characteristic of receptors on normal human cells. These results now permit a systematic analysis of human IgE binding and a search for therapeutically useful inhibitors of that binding."

(1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 854–859). The 90- and 48-kDa core proteins share the epitope of the monoclonal antibody 6G12 which was used to screen a human lung fibroblast expression cDNA library. Rescreening of the libraries yielded clone 48K5 with an insert of 3439 base pairs. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against a fragment of the protein encoded by the 48K5 cDNA different from the part carrying the 6G12 epitope. These antibodies specifically recognize the 90- and 48-kDa core proteins on Western blots of total cellular extracts of human lung fibroblast HSPG. The specific reactivity of the polyclonal antiserum confirms the identity of the 48K5 clone and further distinguishes the 48- and the 90-kDa core proteins, which do share the 6G12-defined epitope and at least one additional antigenic determinant with the 48K5 cDNA-encoded protein, from the 125-, 64-, and 35-kDa core proteins of cell surface HSPG of human lung fibroblasts which do not react with either antibody preparation. The protein encoded by the 48K5 clone contains a stop-transfer sequence indicative of an integral membrane protein and three potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites. The 48K5 clone detects two major poly(A)+ RNA species in human lung fibroblasts presumably generated by the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. The 48K5 gene was mapped to chromosome 8q23 by in situ hybridization and hybridization to DNA of somatic cell hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W2044727514,"The respiratory chain complexes of mitochondria consist of many different subunits, of which only a few partake directly in electron transport. The functions of the subunits that do not contain prosthetic groups are largely unknown. The cytochrome reductase complex of Neurospora crassa, for examine, consists of nine different subunits, of which the peripheral membrane proteins I and II (ref.3) that are located on the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane are the largest subunits devoid of redox centres. Significantly, a cytochrome reductase fraction lacking these two subunits was inactive in electron transfer, and in yeast mutants with defective genes for either of the two subunits, assembly of the reductase is disrupted. Most mitochondrial proteins are imported into the mitochondrion as precursor proteins, and two proteins are necessary for cleaving their presequences, namely the matrix processing peptidase (MPP) and the processing enhancing protein (PEP), the latter strongly stimulating the activity of the former. Temperature-sensitive yeast mutants, which are affected in PEP or MPP, accumulate precursors at the nonpermissive temperature. We report here that subunit I of the cytochrome reductase can be grouped as members of the same protein family."
https://openalex.org/W1520872047,"Abstract Heparan sulfate N-sulfotransferase catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups from adenosine 3'-phosphate, 5'-phosphosulfate to the free amino groups of glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate. We have identified a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant, designated pgsE-606, which is 3-5-fold defective in N-sulfotransferase activity. The residual enzyme activity is indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme with respect to Km values for adenosine 3'-phosphate,5'-phosphosulfate and N-desulfoheparin, pH dependence, Arrhenius activation energy, and thermal lability. The mutation is recessive, and mixing experiments indicate that the mutant does not produce soluble antagonists of N-sulfotransferase. Inspection of the heparan sulfate chains from the mutant showed that the extent of N-sulfation is reduced about 2-3-fold. The addition of sulfate to hydroxyl groups on the chain is reduced to a similar extent, suggesting that N-sulfation and O-sulfation are normally coupled. Nitrous acid fragmentation of the chains showed that N-sulfated glucosamine residues are spaced much less frequently than in heparan sulfate from wild-type cells. The close correlation of enzyme activity to the number and position of N-sulfate groups indicates that N-sulfotransferase plays a pivotal role in determining the extent of sulfation of heparan sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1656892743,"The H+-ATPase, located in the yeast plasma membrane and encoded by the PMA1 gene, provides energy for the active transport of nutrients and regulates intracellular pH. Expression of the PMA1 gene is essential for cell growth and development. In this study, progressive deletions of the PMA1 promoter fused to the beta-galactosidase gene have identified two upstream activating sequences. These upstream activating sequences have high homologies with the consensus sequence known to control the expression of the ribosomal protein genes (RPG). In vivo deletion of these RPG sequences from the PMA1 gene results in slower growth and reduces ATPase activity to one-third of its original value. The RPG sequences from PMA1 interact with the promoter binding factor TUF. Thus, PMA1 belongs to the RPG-TUF system which includes many constitutive genes encoding nonrelated functions such as ATP metabolism, transcription, translation, and active transport."
https://openalex.org/W1671195947,"Abstract Heparitinase digestion of the hydrophobic membrane-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) of fetal human lung fibroblasts yields core proteins of various sizes: i.e. monomeric core proteins of 125, 90, 64, 48, and 35 kDa and a disulfide-linked dimeric core protein composed of approximately 35-kDa subunits. By immunizing BALB/c mice with liposome-incorporated HSPG, we have obtained a total of five anti-HSPG monoclonal antibodies (Mabs, i.e. Mabs S1, 1C7, 2E9, 6G12, and 10H4) with different specificities. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 125I-labeled membrane HSPG immunoprecipitated with these Mabs revealed that Mabs 1C7 and 2E9 bind only membrane HSPG which yield a 125-kDa core protein after heparitinase digestion, whereas Mab S1-bound HSPG yield a 64-kDa core protein, and Mabs 6G12 and 10H4 retain membrane HSPG with a 48-kDa core protein. Western blotting of the heparitinase-digested proteoglycans and immunostaining with the Mabs confirmed this pattern of reactivity. However, in this assay, Mabs 6G12 and 10H4 also detected a minor approximately 90-kDa core protein in addition to the 48-kDa core protein. Except perhaps for the 10H4 epitope, the epitopes recognized by these Mabs appear to be part of the peptide moieties as they resisted complete deglycosylation of the HSPG with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. Since these data were inconsistent with a direct relationship between the major core proteins, the 48-, 64-, and 125-kDa core proteins were immunopurified and further compared by peptide mapping with Staphylococcus aureus protease V8, trypsin, and CNBr cleavage. Clearly distinct peptide patterns were obtained for the three different core proteins. These results imply that the 48-, 64-, and the 125-kDa membrane HSPG core proteins of human lung fibroblasts are derived from distinct proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1548949601,"Abstract The selC gene of Escherichia coli codes for a novel tRNA species which is aminoacylated by L-serine and is required for the insertion of selenocysteine into proteins (Leinfelder, W., Zehelein, E., Mandrand-Berthelot, M.-A., and Bock, A. (1988) Nature 331, 723-725). As a first step toward the elucidation of the postulated pathway for selenocysteine formation from an L-serine residue esterified to tRNA, we have examined whether an increase in the selC gene dosage allows the demonstration of selenocysteyl-tRNA formation in vivo. To this end, cells of an E. coli strain carrying selC on a multicopy plasmid were labeled with [75Se]selenite, their tRNA was isolated and deacylated, and the hydrolysate was analyzed by thin layer chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. Both methods unequivocally demonstrated that the increase in the selC gene product concentration correlated with an augmented level of selenocysteine bound to tRNA. The formation of selenocysteine depended on the presence of functional products of the selA and selD genes but not of the selB gene. The selB gene product, therefore, may have a function in the decoding step itself."
https://openalex.org/W1583270177,"We report a procedure for the large-scale purification of the Escherichia coli Rep protein, a helicase that is involved in the replication of the E. coli chromosome as well as a number of single-stranded bacteriophages. The procedure starts with E. coli cells harboring an overproducing plasmid, pRepO, in which the E. coli rep gene is under transcriptional control of the inducible lambda PL promoter (Colasanti, J., and Denhardt, D. T. (1987) Mol. Gen. Genet. 209, 382-390). The purification procedure results in greater than 98% pure Rep protein, which is free of contaminating nuclease activity, with yields of 40-50 mg of Rep protein/50 g of induced MZ-1/pRepO cells. We also show that cell death occurs upon inducing such a large overproduction of the E. coli Rep protein in MZ-1/pRepO. The Rep protein purified by this procedure has high specific single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity, as well as helicase activity, with an apparent 3' to 5' directionality. The extinction coefficient of purified E. coli Rep protein is epsilon 280 = 1.16 +/- 0.04 ml mg-1 cm-1 (8.47 +/- 0.28 X 10(4) M-1 cm-1) in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.10 M NaCl at 25 degrees C. The solubility properties of the purified Rep protein have been examined as a function of glycerol, NaCl, MgCl2, ATP, and ADP concentrations at 25 and 37 degrees C (pH 7.5). Rep protein solubility decreases significantly with decreasing concentrations of glycerol and monovalent salt and increasing temperature; however, the presence of 1.5 mM ATP or ADP or MgCl2 at low NaCl concentrations increases the solubility. At 4 degrees C, in the presence of 20% glycerol and greater than or equal to 50 mM NaCl, the free Rep protein exists as a stable monomer under all conditions examined (+/- ATP and +/- MgCl2). The single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity decreases with increasing glycerol concentration, such that in 25% (v/v) glycerol it has approximately 40% of its activity as compared to solutions that contain no glycerol. The dependence of the single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity on salt concentration for a series of monovalent salts indicates the presence of both cation and anion effects, with decreasing activity in the order glutamate greater than acetate greater than chloride. The ability to obtain highly purified E. coli Rep protein in large quantities with relative ease will greatly facilitate physical characterizations of the protein and its interactions with DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1496193127,"The binding of 125I- and 14C-caldesmon to actin and actin-tropomyosin was studied using a cosedimentation technique and was analyzed by the method of McGhee and von Hippel [1974) J. Mol. Biol. 86, 469-489) for the binding of large ligands to a homogeneous lattice. The binding was adequately described by a single class of binding sites with a stoichiometry between 1:7 and 1:10. The binding exhibited a small degree of positive cooperativity (omega = 5-6) which was the same in the presence and absence of tropomyosin. The association constant for the binding of caldesmon to an isolated binding site was enhanced, from about 6 X 10(5) to about 1.4 X 10(6) M-1, by the presence of smooth muscle tropomyosin. Caldesmon inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity of skeletal myosin subfragment 1 in both the absence and presence of tropomyosin. Maximum inhibition of ATPase activity occurred when one caldesmon molecule bound to seven actin monomers. A greater degree of inhibition was observed in the presence of tropomyosin than in the absence. This greater inhibition cannot be explained totally by the increased strength of binding of caldesmon to actin in the presence of tropomyosin. Finally, Ca2+-calmodulin completely reversed the binding of caldesmon to actin."
https://openalex.org/W1531008858,"Adenovirus EIIA upstream sequences which contain the binding sites for proteins ATF and EIIF act as an enhancer and can be trans-activated by both E1A and SV40 T/t-antigens. Specific mutation of either the ATF or EIIF binding site demonstrates that both act as positive regulators, decreasing transcription greater than 10-fold. Mutation of both the ATF and EIIF binding sites inhibited the EIIA enhancer 200-fold. Analysis of insertion mutations suggests that the spatial alignment of the upstream ATF and EIIF binding sites with respect to the downstream EIIF binding site on the DNA helix is important. Consistent with previous findings, using gel shift analysis we demonstrate that the binding activity of EIIF is increased following wild-type adenovirus infection. In contrast, using identical gel shift conditions, the binding activity of ATF is decreased by viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1526940495,"Osmotic stimulation increases arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) mRNA levels and poly(A) tail size concurrently. We now show that these changes are independently regulated. Whereas depletion of serotonin with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) blocked the increase in hypothalamic levels of AVP and OT mRNA following osmotic stimuli in rats (2% saline drinking or dehydration), the increase in mRNA size was similar in PCPA and control animals. PCPA alone did not modify mRNA size. In addition to demonstrating an apparent obligatory role for serotonin in osmotically induced AVP and OT mRNA accumulation, the results provide evidence for different signaling pathways mediating transcript abundance and poly(A) tail length. Direct investigation of the regulatory mechanisms should be amenable to study in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1500462989,"Abstract The mechanism of inhibition of eicosanoid synthesis by glucocorticoids has been investigated using differentiated U937 cells as a model. These cells synthesize thromboxane A2 (TXA2) in response to a variety of agonists, and synthesis of TXA2 initiated by certain stimuli was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with glucocorticoids. The inhibitory response was specific for glucocorticoid steroids and required receptor occupancy based on both the rate of onset of the inhibitory activity and the correlation between potency and receptor affinity of various analogs. The inhibitory response was also specific for the agonist used to initiate TXA2 synthesis. Both lipopolysaccharide- and zymosan-induced TXA2 synthesis were inhibited by increasing concentrations of dexamethasone (greater than 80%, IC50 10 nM), while synthesis initiated by addition of either exogenous arachidonic acid or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was unaffected over the same concentration range. The latter result indicates that the dexamethasone block is upstream from release of esterified arachidonic acid. Attempts to localize the block more accurately showed that although dexamethasone was not acting as a generalized inhibitor of transcription or translation, its ability to inhibit TXA2 synthesis was mimicked by the activity of actinomycin D and cycloheximide. The role of the purported phospholipase inhibitor protein lipocortin 1 in mediating the dexamethasone inhibition of TXA2 synthesis was studied by examining the effect of dexamethasone on lipocortin 1 metabolism. Under conditions which gave maximal inhibition of lipopolysaccharide- or zymosan-stimulated TXA2 synthesis, dexamethasone had no effect on the steady state level of lipocortin 1 mRNA or protein, indicating that lipocortin 1 induction by dexamethasone is not responsible for the observed inhibition. Furthermore, lipocortin 1 was not secreted from the cells under any conditions examined, and the intracellular form had a relatively long half-life (greater than 21 h). The lack of induction of lipocortin 1 by dexamethasone and the fact that it is not released from the cells are both inconsistent with the properties previously described for lipocortin-like activities and indicate that lipocortin 1 is not a glucocorticoid second messenger in this experimental model. Although the data are consistent with a mechanism involving inhibition of a factor that activates TXA2 synthesis, we cannot rule out a mechanism involving glucocorticoid induction of a phospholipase inhibitor protein distinct from lipocortin 1."
https://openalex.org/W13918475,"We have previously provided evidence for ATP-dependent glutamate uptake into synaptic vesicles, and, based upon the unique properties of the vesicular uptake system, we have proposed that the vesicular glutamate translocator plays a crucial role in selecting glutamate for neurotransmission. In this study, we have solubilized the vesicular glutamate uptake system, proposed to consist of at least a glutamate translocator and a proton pump Mg-ATPase, from rat brain synaptic vesicles, and reconstituted the functional ATP-dependent glutamate uptake system into liposomes. The glutamate uptake in the reconstituted system is dependent upon ATP, markedly potentiated by low millimolar concentrations of chloride and inhibited by agents known to dissipate electrochemical proton gradients. Moreover, it exhibited low affinity for glutamate (Km = 2 m M ), yet high specificity for glutamate; thus, it did not recognize aspartate and other agents known to interact with glutamate receptors. These properties are indistinguishable from those observed in intact synaptic vesicles. The solubilized functional components of the glutamate uptake system, alone or as a complex, have been estimated to have a Stokes radius in the range of 69 to 84 A. The reconstitution experiments described here provide a functional assay for the solubilized vesicular glutamate uptake system and represent an initial step towards the purification of the glutamate translocator."
https://openalex.org/W1631661117,"We have carried out an analysis of the synthesis, cellular accumulation, and membrane binding of the chloroplast-encoded subunits of the ATP synthase (α, β, ϵ, I, III, and IV) in several mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii defective in photophosphorylation. These data gave some insight on the putative genetic lesion in each mutant and allowed some characterization of the assembly and stabilization of the ATP synthase complex in the thylakoid membranes. Four chloroplast mutants are likely to be altered in chloroplast structural genes coding for coupling factor (CF) 1 subunits β and ϵ and for CF0 subunits I and IV. A fifth chloroplast mutant and three nuclear mutants were altered in genes regulating either transcription or translation of chloroplast genes coding for CF1 subunits α and β and CF0 subunits III and IV. Evidence is presented (i) for a control of the rate of synthesis of subunit β by subunit α in the absence of ATP synthase assembly and (ii) for an interaction between α and β subunits in the stroma of the chloroplast which protects α subunits from proteolytic degradation. The role of several chloroplast-encoded subunits of CF0 and CF1 in the stabilization of partially assembled ATP synthase is discussed. We conclude that in the absence of ATP synthase assembly, CF0 cannot accumulate in the thylakoid membranes, whereas α and β subunits, presumably engaged in soluble CF1, can accumulate in the stroma of the chloroplast."
https://openalex.org/W1583283620,"Abstract Human interleukin 4 (IL-4) specifically induces the low affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R2/CD23) on the surface of the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Jijoye. At 4 degrees C 125I-IL-4 specifically binds to high affinity receptors (Kd = 4-10 x 10(-11) M; Bmax, 600-1,200 sites/cell). Following a rapid temperature shift from 4 to 37 degrees C, 80% of the receptor-bound 125I-IL-4 disappeared from the cell surface within 20 min (t1/2 = 8.9 min). For every two internalized molecules of IL-4 (t1/2 = 13 min), one molecule of IL-4 dissociated from the cell surface (t1/2 = 25 min). More than 90% of the internalized IL-4 was released in a degraded form into the medium following first order kinetics (t1/2 = 68 min). Internalization was inhibited by cytoskeletal disrupting and lysosomotropic agents. Incubating cells with 1 nM IL-4 resulted in a rapid down-regulation of IL-4 receptors (75% loss after 2 h); a reexpression of receptor to control level occurred after 20 h in spite of the presence of a large excess of IL-4. Reexpression was delayed by chloroquine and blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D. By using the cross-linking agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, three polypeptides of Mr 130,000, 80,000, and 70,000 were specifically labeled with 125I-IL-4. These three polypeptides coordinately disappeared and reappeared with the 125I-IL-4 binding sites. The induction of Fc epsilon R2/CD23 required prolonged incubation (greater than 8 h) with IL-4 and thus may be dependent on the reexpression of IL-4 receptor."

(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17251-17254). In the same operon of the above two genes we found a gene encoding a very hydrophobic protein of 101 amino acids (Mr = 10,362). A proteolipid was purified from the membranes of this bacteria in which partial amino acid sequences matched with the sequence deduced from the gene. Significant amino acid sequence homology and a similar hydropathy profile appeared when the sequence was compared with the 8-kDa proteolipid subunit of F0F1-ATPases. It is about 30 amino acids larger than the 8-kDa proteolipid and has a small (11-amino acid) repeat sequence. However, it is distinct from the 16-kDa proteolipid subunit of an eukaryotic vacuolar H+-ATPase (Mandel, M., Moriyama, Y., Hulmes, J.D., Pan, Y.-E., Nelson, H., and Nelson, N. (1988) Proc. Natl.

https://openalex.org/W1608555941,"Abstract The uncE114 mutation (Gln42----Glu) in subunit c of the Escherichia coli H+ ATP synthetase causes uncoupling of proton translocation from ATP hydrolysis (Mosher, M. E., White, L. K., Hermolin, J., and Fillingame, R. H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4807-4814). In the background of strain ER, the mutation led to dissociation of F1 from the membrane. Ten revertants to the uncE114 mutation were isolated, and the uncE gene was cloned and sequenced. Six of the revertants were intragenic and had substitutions of glycine, alanine, or valine for the mutant glutamate residue at position 42. The intragenic, revertant uncE genes were incorporated into an otherwise wild type chromosome of strain ER. Membrane vesicles prepared from each of the revertants showed a restoration of F1 binding to F0. The Val42 revertant differed from the other two revertants in that the ATPase activity of F1 was inhibited when membrane bound. This was shown by the stimulation of ATPase activity when F1 was released from the membrane. The Gly42 and Ala42 revertants demonstrated membrane ATPase activity that was resistant to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide treatment. Resistance was shown to be due to the increased dissociation of F1 from the membrane under ATPase assay conditions. The Ala42 revertant showed a significant reduction in ATP-dependent quenching of quinacrine fluorescence that was attributed to less efficient coupling of ATP hydrolysis to H+ translocation, whereas the other revertants showed responses very near to that of wild type. Minor changes in the F1-F0 interaction in all three revertants were indicated by an increase in H+ leakiness, as judged by reduced NADH-dependent quenching of quinacrine fluorescence. The minor defects in the revertants support the idea that residue 42 is involved in the binding and coupling of F1 to F0 but also show that the conserved glutamine (or asparagine) is not absolutely necessary in this function."
https://openalex.org/W1568955329,"This report presents evidence for diversity in membrane binding sites between three forms of ankyrin: brain ankyrin, erythrocyte ankyrin, and a variant of erythrocyte ankyrin (protein 2.2) present in circulating human erythrocytes that is missing a regulatory domain. These ankyrins were compared with respect to binding to kidney microsomes and exhibited the following behavior. 1) Brain and erythrocyte ankyrin each bind to distinct sites. 2) Protein 2.2 is an activated ankyrin that binds to all of the sites accessible to both brain and erythrocyte ankyrin and, in addition, associates with its own specialized sites. 3) The specificity of these membrane sites for various ankyrins is not absolute but reflects 2.5-10-fold differences in relative affinities. Further evidence that binding sites of different ankyrins share some common features is that the cytoplasmic domain of the erythrocyte anion transporter associates with all three ankyrins and displaces binding of the ankyrin variants to kidney membranes. The differences between erythrocyte and brain ankyrins in association with kidney membranes are likely to have physiological relevance to kidney because immunologically related isoforms of ankyrin are expressed in this tissue: erythroid ankyrin which is restricted to the basolateral domains of two cell types and a brain-related ankyrin expressed in all cells and present on apical as well as basolateral membrane surfaces. An unanticipated observation was the discovery of a membrane-associated ankyrin protease in kidney that is specific for erythrocyte ankyrin and may selectively activate the erythroid isoform of ankyrin. The variety of binding sites within this group of ankyrin proteins supports the idea that ankyrins are capable of linking a number of different membrane proteins to the spectrin-actin skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1576086014,"We have carried out an analysis of the synthesis, cellular accumulation, and membrane binding of the chloroplast-encoded subunits of the ATP synthase ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\epsilon$, I, III, and IV) in several mutants of $Chlamydomonas reinhardtii$ defective in photophosphorylation. These data gave some insight on the putative genetic lesion in each mutant and allowed some characterization of the assembly and stabilization of the ATP synthase complex in the thylakoid membranes.
 Four chloroplast mutants are likely to be altered in chloroplast structural genes coding for coupling factor (CF) 1 subunits $\beta$ and $\epsilon$ and for CF$_o$ subunits I and IV. A fifth chloroplast mutant and three nuclear mutants were altered in genes regulating either transcription or translation of chloroplast genes coding for CF1 sub-units $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and CF$_o$ subunits III and IV. Evidence is presented (i) for a control of the rate of synthesis of subunit $\beta$ by subunit $\alpha$ in the absence of ATP synthase assembly and (ii) for an interaction between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits in the stroma of the chloroplast which protects $\alpha$ subunits from proteolytic degradation. The role of several chloroplast-encoded subunits of CF$_o$ and CF$_1$ in the stabilization of partially assembled ATP synthase is discussed. We conclude that in the absence of ATP synthase assembly, CF$_o$ cannot accumulate in the thylakoid membranes, whereas $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits, presumably engaged in soluble CF$_1$, can accumulate in the stroma of the chloroplast."

https://openalex.org/W1501545448,"Abstract Elements controlling tissue-specific expression of the human atrial natriuretic factor gene have been examined in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiocytes. When a 68-base pair fragment from human atrial natriuretic factor (hANF) 5'-flanking sequence (positions -400 to -333) was placed upstream from the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter linked to a bacterial reporter gene (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase), a tissue-specific positive regulatory effect was observed in atrial as well as ventricular cardiocytes but not in nonmyocardial cells. The cis-acting element in this fragment was orientation- and position-dependent. Examination of nuclear protein extracts for the presence of factors capable of interacting with the 5'-flanking sequence of the hANF gene revealed a cardiocyte-specific factor which bound to the 68-base pair fragment. This association was both tissue- and sequence-specific. These findings indicate that a cis-acting element present in the proximal 5'-flanking sequence confers tissue-specific expression upon the hANF gene, possibly through association with a cardiac-specific nuclear protein."

https://openalex.org/W1583135762,"Abstract The aziridinium of purified quinacrine mustard at 50 microM inactivates the bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase with a pseudo-first order rate constant of 0.07 min-1 at pH 7.0 and 23 degrees C. An apparent Kd of 27 microM for the enzyme-reagent complex was estimated from the dependence of the rate of inactivation on the concentration of quinacrine mustard. The pH inactivation profile revealed that deprotonation of a group with a pKa of about 6.7 is necessary for inactivation. The amount of reagent incorporated into the protein increased linearly with the extent of inactivation. Complete inactivation was estimated to occur when 3 mol of reagent were incorporated/mol of F1. Enzyme, in which steady state ATPase was inactivated by 98% by quinacrine mustard, hydrolyzed substoichiometric ATP with zero order kinetics suggesting that residual activity is catalyzed by F1 in which at least one beta subunit is modified. By exploiting the reactivity of the aziridinium of covalently attached reagent with [3H] aniline, sites modified by quinacrine mustard were labeled with 3H. Isolation of radioactive cyanogen bromide peptides derived from F1 inactivated with the reagent in the presence of [3H]aniline which were identified by sequence analysis and sequence analyses of radioactive tryptic fragments arising from them have revealed the following. About two thirds of the radioactivity incorporated into the enzyme during inactivation is apparently esterified to one or more of the carboxylic acid side chains in a CNBr-tryptic fragment of the beta subunit with the sequence: 394DELSEEDK401. The remainder of the radioactivity is associated with at least two sites within the cyanogen bromide peptide containing residues 293-358 of the beta subunit. From these results it is concluded that inactivation of F1 by the aziridinium of quinacrine mustard is due, at least in part, to modification of one or more of the carboxylic acid side chains in the DELSEED segment of the beta subunit and possibly also to modification of unspecified amino acid side chains between residues 302-356 of the beta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1606969853,"The photoaffinity analogs 2-azidoadenosine 5′-tri(di)-phosphate (2-N3AT(D)P) and 8-azidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate (8-N3ATP) have been used to probe the substructural organization of the nucleotide binding pockets within the α and β heavy chains of the outer arm dynein from Chlamydomonas flagella. Both 2-N3ATP and 8-N3ATP are competitive inhibitors of dynein ATP hydrolysis, and both analogs are themselves hydrolyzed by the α-β dimer. Following vanadate-dependent photolysis at the V1 site (by UV irradiation in the presence of Mg2+, ATP, and vanadate), both probes exclusively labeled the larger fragment from the α chain. In contrast, within the β chain the predominant insertion sites for the two analogs were located on opposite sides of the V1 site. Therefore, the hydrolytic pockets of these two molecules have different substructures. Vanadate-dependent photolysis of the α and β chains at the V2 sites (by UV irradiation in the presence of vanadate and Mn2+) profoundly affected the predominant modification sites; for example, following photolysis at the V2a site neither fragment of the α chain was photolabeled by 2-N3ATP or 8-N3ATP. Based on the photolabeling patterns obtained, the single V2 site within the β chain is predicted to be analogous to the V2b site within the α chain. The results support the hypothesis that the V2 sites occur within the ATP binding pockets, and indicate that these functional domains are composed of portions of the heavy chains which are linearly separated by up to at least 100,000 daltons. Thus, the central region of each dynein heavy chain must be extensively folded so as to bring the widely separated photocleavage and photolabeling sites together within a single catalytic unit."
https://openalex.org/W112751958,"Abstract Pig gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase can be covalently modified with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) (about 1 mol/mol enzyme), and this modification is not observed in the presence of ATP, suggesting that PLP binds to a specific Lys residue in the ATP binding site or the region in its vicinity (Maeda, M., Tagaya, M., and Futai, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 3652-3656). The peptides labeled with radioactive PLP could be released from the gastric membrane vesicles quantitatively by chymotrypsin treatment, and two peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatographies. These peptides were not obtained from vesicles incubated with PLP in the presence of ATP. The sequences of the two peptides were NH2-Asn-Ser-Thr-Asn-Lys-Phe-COOH and NH2-Ser-Thr-Asn-Lys-Phe-COOH, exactly corresponding to residues 493-498 and 494-498, respectively, of pig gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase sequenced recently (Maeda, M., Ishizaki, J., and Futai, M. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 157, 203-209). Lys-497 was concluded to be the binding site of PLP, as pyridoxyl-Lys was identified at the corresponding position. This Lys residue is conserved in (Na+ + K+)- and Ca2+-ATPases. The possible amino acid residues in the catalytic site of gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1538428170,"Estrogen-sensitive human breast cancer cells (ZR-75-1) were incubated with the 3H-labeled adrenal C19-Δ5-steroids dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its fully estrogenic derivative, androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol (Δ5-diol) for various time intervals. When fractionated by solvent partition, Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography and silica gel TLC, the labeled cell components were largely present (40-75%) in three highly nonpolar, lipoidal fractions. Mild alkaline hydrolysis of these lipoidal derivatives yielded either free 3H-labeled DHEA or Δ5-diol. The three lipoidal fractions cochromatographed with the synthetic DHEA 3β-esters, Δ5-diol 3β (or 17β)-monoesters and Δ5-diol 3β,17β-diesters of long-chain fatty acids. DHEA and Δ5-diol were mainly esterified to saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids. For Δ5-diol, the preferred site of esterification of the fatty acids is the 3β-position while some esterification also takes place at the 17β-position. Time course studies show that ZR-75-1 cells accumulate Δ5-diol mostly (> 95%) as fatty acid mono- and diesters while DHEA is converted to Δ5-diol essentially as the esterified form. Furthermore, while free C19-Δ5-steroids rapidly diffuse out of the cells after removal of the precursor [3H]Δ5-diol, the fatty acid ester derivatives are progressively hydrolyzed, and DHEA and Δ5-diol thus formed are then sulfurylated prior to their release into the culture medium. The latter process however is rate-limited, since new steady-state levels of free steroids and fatty acid esters are rapidly reached and maintained for extended periods of time after removal of precursor, thus maintaining minimal concentrations of intracellular steroids. The rapid rate and large extent of esterification of DHEA and Δ5-diol to long-chain fatty acids in breast cancer cells indicate that this reaction could constitute an important regulatory step in the estrogenic action of DHEA and Δ5-diol in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1560868417,"Abstract Transfection into lymphoid cells of a chimeric T-cell receptor-immunoglobulin gene has been used to generate a secreted water-soluble form of the variable (V) domain of a human T-cell receptor alpha chain for use in structural (i.e. x-ray crystallographic) studies. The chimeric protein consists of the V alpha region of the T-cell receptor of a diphtheria toxoid-specific human T-cell clone fused to a human immunoglobulin kappa light chain constant (C) region. It is efficiently secreted by myeloma cells as a noncovalent homodimer of 65-kDa molecular mass in the absence of either immunoglobulin heavy or light chain. The V alpha C kappa protein is extensively glycosylated, and its secretion is glycosylation-dependent. Chimeric genes containing the V beta region of this particular T-cell receptor linked to immunoglobulin C kappa or C gamma 2 regions are expressed intracellularly, but the products, although glycosylated, are not secreted, nor do they assemble with the V alpha C kappa protein. This suggests that the chimeric beta chain-immunoglobulin proteins are incorrectly folded and/or processed due either to the design of the gene fusions themselves or to the absence of vital T-cell-specific accessory molecules in the myeloma host."
https://openalex.org/W285452788,"Heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans of BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts, metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate precursors, are resolved by preparative Sepharose CL-4B chromatography into distinct products, the proteoglycans and the glycosaminoglycan free chains, the latter resistant to appreciable molecular weight shift upon alkaline borohydride reduction. The in situ localization of these cell layer molecules was probed with glycosaminoglycan degrading enzymes (lyases) of bacterial origin, which were used to digest isotopically prelabeled monolayer cultures prior to extraction with a nonionic detergent in the presence of protease inhibitors. Most of the total cellular complement of glycosaminoglycan free chains, in addition to the proteoglycans, proved accessible to the lyases under conditions which did not appreciably affect cell viability or morphology. Because these results were also obtained under low temperature (4 degrees C) conditions and in the presence of phenylarsine oxide, a sulfhydryl reagent that irreversibly inhibits endocytosis, the effects of the lyases are not dependent upon internalization by the cells. The cellular production and cell surface expression of the glycosaminoglycan free chains were not materially altered when lysosomal function was pharmacologically inhibited, confirming that the free chains are not intracellular intermediates in the lysosomal degradation pathways of proteoglycans. Contrary to the prevailing model, our observations establish that, at least in the cell line under study, glycosaminoglycan free chains are located on the external leaflet of the plasma membrane, as such suggesting that these products are biologically active components of cell surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1494323283,"Abstract A polypeptide (Mr = 15,000) has been purified from Escherichia coli cell extracts that significantly stimulates the duplex DNA unwinding reaction catalyzed by E. coli Rep protein. The Rep helicase unwinding reaction was stimulated by as much as 20-fold, upon addition of the stimulatory protein, using either a 71-base pair or a 343-base pair partial duplex DNA molecule as a substrate. The purified Rep helicase stimulatory protein (RHSP) had no intrinsic helicase activity or ATP hydrolysis activity and did not stimulate the single-stranded DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by Rep protein. It is likely that RHSP stimulates the Rep helicase unwinding reaction by stoichiometric binding to single-stranded DNA. However, a specific interaction between Rep protein and RHSP cannot be ruled out, since RHSP did not stimulate the duplex DNA unwinding reactions catalyzed by E. coli helicase I or the recently discovered 75-kDa helicase. RHSP did stimulate the duplex DNA unwinding reaction catalyzed by E. coli helicase II. The identification and subsequent purification of RHSP from cell extracts demonstrates the feasibility of using direct helicase assays to purify stimulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1563348198,"Abstract Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) is a plasma and platelet protein with undefined function in vivo. It has been reported to inhibit rosette formation between murine T cells and erythrocytes. We have shown that HRGP binds specifically to human T lymphocytes but not sheep erythrocytes and have demonstrated a 56-kDa HRGP-binding protein on the T cell surface which is distinct from the CD2 sheep erythrocyte receptor. We have now investigated whether HRGP can inhibit human T cell-sheep erythrocyte rosette formation and whether HRGP can modulate T cell activation. HRGP at physiologic concentrations specifically inhibited rosette formation between human T lymphocytes and sheep erythrocytes. HRGP suppressed proliferation of antigen receptor (CD3)-triggered T cells induced by interleukin 2; this suppression was specifically reversed by prior incubation of HRGP with affinity-purified anti-HRGP IgG. Addition of HRGP 12-24 h after CD3 triggering no longer suppressed T cell proliferation, suggesting HRGP suppressed T cell division by interfering with one or more early events in the process of T cell activation. Human serum (containing 100-150 micrograms/ml HRGP) was also capable of suppressing T cell proliferation; serum which had been immunodepleted of HRGP no longer inhibited T cell proliferation. Furthermore, HRGP inhibited interleukin 2 receptor expression on activated T cells, causing decreased T cell interferon-gamma release and altered T cell-dependent inhibition of erythropoiesis. HRGP is thus capable of modulating T cell activation and T cell immunoregulation; HRGP may function as a natural suppressive regulator of human T lymphocyte activation."
https://openalex.org/W1541163014,"Abstract Previous studies from this laboratory (Brooker, R. J., and Slayman, C. W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 222-226; Davenport, J. W., and Slayman, C. W. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16007-16013) have used the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to define two sites on the Neurospora plasma membrane H+-ATPase: a site which reacts in several minutes with no loss of enzymatic activity and a site which reacts in tens of minutes to produce complete inactivation of the enzyme. The slow site is protected when MgATP or MgADP is bound to the catalytic site of the ATPase. The present study demonstrates that the fluorescent reagent 5-[2-iodoacetamido)ethyl)-1-aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid (IAEDANS) can be used to label five of the eight cysteine residues of the Neurospora ATPase (Cys376, Cys409, Cys472, Cys532, Cys545). Tryptic peptides bearing those residues have been purified by high performance liquid chromatography and located within the known primary structure of the ATPase by amino acid analysis and/or sequencing. By pretreating the enzyme with NEM in the presence or absence of MgADP before incubation with IAEDANS, it has been possible to identify the fast NEM site as Cys545 and the slow MgADP-protectable NEM site as Cys532. Both residues lie within the central hydrophilic domain of the protein, close to a highly conserved stretch of amino acids that may be involved in nucleotide binding. However, all five IAEDANS-reactive cysteines can be nearly completely modified by the less bulky sulfhydryl reagent methyl methanethiosulfonate with less than 20% inhibition of enzyme activity; thus, none of the five cysteines can be considered to play a direct role in the reaction cycle of the ATPase."

Furthermore, alpha 1-antitrypsin secreted by HepG2 cells was modified indistinguishably by treatment of the cells with dMM and 1-[3H]dMM. Thus, 1-[3H]dMM had chemical and biological properties identical with authentic dMM. Uptake of [14C]mannose by K562 cells could be inhibited by glucose but not by the mannose analogue dMM. Thus, dMM does not enter the cell through hexose transporter(s). Uptake of 1-[3H]dMM by K562 cells could not be inhibited by increasing concentrations of nonradioactive dMM (from 1-32,000 microM), showing transport of dMM into cells through nonfacilitated diffusion. Furthermore, uptake of 1-[3H]dMM by K562 cells was observed at 0 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1598242979,"The Mg2+-ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin IA is activated by F-actin only when the myosin heavy chain is phosphorylated at a single residue. In order to gain insight into the conformational changes that may be responsible for the effects of F-actin and phosphorylation on myosin I ATPase, we have studied their effects on the proteolysis of the myosin IA heavy chain by trypsin. Trypsin initially cleaves the unphosphorylated, 140-kDa heavy chain of Acanthamoeba myosin IA at sites 38 and 112 kDa from its NH2 terminus and secondarily at sites 64 and 91 kDa from the NH2 terminus. F-actin has no effect on tryptic cleavage at the 91- and 112-kDa sites, but does protect the 38-kDa site and the 64-kDa site. Phosphorylation (which occurs very near the 38-kDa site) has no detectable effect on the tryptic cleavage pattern in the absence of F-actin or on F-actin protection of the 64-kDa site, but significantly enhances F-actin protection of the 38-kDa site. Protection of the 64-kDa site is probably due to direct steric blocking because F-actin binds to this region of the heavy chain. The protection of the 38-kDa site by F-actin may be the result of conformational changes in this region of the heavy chain induced by F-actin binding near the 64-kDa site and by phosphorylation. The conformational changes in the heavy chain of myosin IA that are detected by alterations in its susceptibility to proteolysis are likely to be related to the conformational changes that are involved in the phosphorylation-regulated actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activities of Acanthamoeba myosins IA and IB."
https://openalex.org/W1509931604,"Abstract We have measured the rate constant for ATP release from myosin heads of Ca2+-activated, demembranated muscle fibers using the technique of phosphate-water oxygen exchange. Single rabbit psoas fibers were held in an activating solution in [18O]water ([MgATP] = 8 mM, ionic strength = 0.2 M, pH = 7.0, 24 degrees C). After about 20% hydrolysis of ATP, product Pi and remaining ATP were isolated, and the distribution of 18O in both molecules was analyzed using a mass spectrometer. The exchange in Pi was similar to that previously reported (Hibberd, M. G., Webb, M. R., Goldman, Y. E., and Trentham, D. R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3496-3501). The amount of 18O in ATP gave a rate constant of about 4 s-1 for ATP release, if it is assumed that each rate constant in the pathway of ATP hydrolysis has the same value for all myosin ATPase sites. However, the distribution of 18O in both released Pi and ATP is not well explained by a single pathway for ATP hydrolysis. We present a model that indicates how such distributions could arise from a range of values for the rate constants for Pi and ATP release from actomyosin, and this range is determined by differences in the amounts of strain in attached crossbridges. The kinetic information obtained from these isotope exchange experiments is compared to show that they give a compatible set of rate constants for actomyosin in fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1624025223,"Abstract A number of arginine derivatives were tested for their ability to inhibit arginine uptake into vacuolar membrane vesicles of Neurospora crassa. The guanido side chain and L-configuration were found to be important for recognition by the arginine carrier. Based upon the specificity of recognition, a reactive arginine derivative (N alpha-p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl arginyl diazomethane) was synthesized which has an intact guanido side chain and a diazo group at the carboxyl end. The latter decomposes to a reactive carbene group. This derivative inhibited arginine uptake into vacuolar membrane vesicles at low concentrations. Radioactive N alpha-p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl arginyl diazomethane was covalently bound to vacuoles. Binding was specific for a single membrane protein with an approximate molecular weight of 40,000, saturable (2 pmol/mg vacuolar membrane protein), and inhibited by 100 mM L-arginine but not by 100 mM L-lysine. The results suggest that this protein is the arginine carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1527895657,"The 11-cis-retinal binding site of rhodopsin is of great interest because it is buried in the membrane but yet must provide an environment for charged amino acids. In addition, the active-site lysine residue must be able to engage in rapid Schiff base formation with 11-cis-retinal at neutral and lower pH values. This requires that this lysine be unprotonated. We have begun to study the environment of the active-site lysine using a reporter group adducted to it. Non-active-site permethylated opsin was reacted with 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde, and the resulting Schiff base was permanently fixed by borohydride reduction. The stoichiometry of incorporation was one. This chromophoric and pH-sensitive reporter group affords information on the active-site environment of rhodopsin by determining the ionization constants of its ionizable groups at different pH values. The pH titration of the modified protein showed a single pKa = 7.8 ± 0.19 ascribable to the ionization of the phenol. The ionization of the modified lysine residue was not observed at all pH values studied. These studies are interpreted to mean that a negatively charged amino acid is propinquous to the active-site lysine residue and that this latter residue does not have an unusually low pKa."
